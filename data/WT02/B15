<a name="RTFToC2">
Senate Tackles Illegal
Immigration</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>On May 2, the Senate voted 97-3 to approve a measure (S164) aimed at
reducing illegal immigration.  A similar House bill approved in March 1996 by a
vote of 333-87 will be reconciled with the Senate bill in a conference
committee.</tt><p>
<tt>The US Senate took up bills to reform illegal (S 1664) and legal (S 1665)
immigration on April 15, 1996.  The scheduled three-day debate was halted April
16 when Democrats demanded votes on amendments to immigration reform
legislation that would bar the use of Social Security trust funds to balance
the budget, and increase the minimum wage from the current $4.25 hourly to
$5.15.  On April 24, the Senate resumed debate on the bill to reduce illegal
immigration, with the final vote on May 2. </tt><p>
<tt>Two issues that came up in the House-approved bill in March 1996 did not
come up in the Senate bill--farmers did not offer an amendment for a guest
worker program, and no amendment was offered to deny K-12 education to illegal
alien children. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Illegal Immigration</u>.  To deter illegal immigration, Simpson's bill
would double the number of Border Patrol agents to 10,000, speed the
deportation of criminal aliens, and call for a triple-tier, 14-mile-long fence
along the border with Mexico south of San Diego.</tt><p>
<tt>The Immigration and Naturalization Service would be required to conduct
pilot programs to test systems that would allow employers to verify the legal
status of newly hired workers--a provision that many called the "heart and
soul" of US efforts to reduce illegal immigration.  An amendment to strike the
pilot projects, on the grounds that they will lead to a national identity card,
were defeated by a 54-46 vote on May 1. </tt><p>
<tt>Simpson's bill would also require states to issue birth certificates and
drivers' licenses that include Social Security numbers and meet federal
anti-counterfeiting standards, deny welfare and other assistance to
unauthorized immigrants, non-immigrants, and PRUCOL residents, and define
"public charge" for the purpose of being deportable from the US as receiving
welfare assistance for 12 or more months in any five-year period. </tt><p>
<tt>Under current law, legal immigrants have limited access to Aid to Families
with Dependent Children, Food Stamps, and the Supplemental Security Income
program for the disabled.  If an immigrant applies for these benefits, and was
sponsored by a US relative, then the US sponsor's income is counted or deemed
to be available to the immigrant, making many immigrants ineligible.</tt><p>
<tt>The major fight in the Senate was how long to deem that the income of
sponsors be available to immigrants, and to which assistance programs deeming
should apply.  Simpson proposed that deeming continue until an immigrant had 40
quarters of employment (10 years) employment in the US; amendments reduced the
deeming period to five years.</tt><p>
<tt>Amendments to limit deeming to cash assistance programs, or to exempt from
deeming federal assistance for higher education, or to exempt from deeming
applicants for assistance who were veterans of the US Armed Forces, or pregnant
women, all failed, mostly by votes of about 55 to 45.</tt><p>
<tt>The Senate bill, as introduced by Simpson, would have restored the
authority of Border Patrol agents to enter open agricultural fields and check
for unauthorized workers--until 1986, the Border Patrol routinely drove into
fields and attempted to apprehend fleeing aliens.  The Senate voted 79-20 to
keep the ban on open field searches on April 24.</tt><p>
<tt>The House of Representatives did not alter the current requirement that the
Border Patrol must obtain a search warrant to enter open fields.</tt><p>
<tt>On April 30, the Senate voted 62-37 to allow the 1966 Cuban Refugee
Adjustment Act to remain US law until Cuba has a democratic government.  Under
the Act, Cubans apply for permanent resident status after living in the United
States for a year, regardless of whether they arrived legally or illegally.
Cubans are the only foreigners granted such automatic US immigrant
status.</tt><p>
<tt>Simpson's bill would have permitted INS asylum officers, with approval of
their supervisors, to exclude asylum applicants who arrive in the US with false
documents or no documents, but the Senate approved an amendment by a vote of
51-49 to substitute Attorney General discretion for dealing with asylum seekers
at ports of entry (see article on terrorism/asylum below).</tt><p>
<tt><u>Legal Immigration.</u>  "There will be no changes to legal immigration
in 1996."  This seemed to be the consensus after the Senate rebuffed by wide
margins efforts to restrict legal immigration--the House bill approved in March
1996 does not change the legal immigration system.</tt><p>
<tt>On April 25, Simpson offered an amendment to the illegal immigration bill
to reduce legal immigration by 10 percent for five years to provide the US with
"breathing space" to absorb newcomers--his amendment was defeated by an 80-20
vote after six hours of debate.  An effort by Senator Feinstein (D-CA) to cap
legal family immigration at 480,000 was also defeated by a vote of
74-26.</tt><p>
<tt>The legal immigration bill as introduced by Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY)
would have reduced legal immigration by 25 percent by eliminating slots for the
adult sons and daughters, and adult brothers and sisters, of US citizens.
However, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved the Kennedy-Abraham amendment
that would restructure the family unification system.  Spouses, minor children,
and parents of US citizens could continue to enter the US without restriction,
but the current 226,000 per year visas available for family unification would
be reduced to 175,000.  The preferences would change to be 1)  the spouses and
minor children of legal immigrants; 2) the unmarried adult sons and daughters
of US citizens; 3) the married sons and daughters of US citizens; 4) the
unmarried children of permanent immigrants and, finally; 5) the adult brothers
and sisters of US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>These proposed changes would likely increase rather than decrease family
unification immigration, largely because over 1.3 million spouses and children
of legal immigrants are currently waiting to immigrate--in many cases they are
already here illegally.  They will be able to come in as the immediate family
members of US citizens as their SAW-eligible fathers become naturalized
citizens.  This means that the "immediate family" backlog for immigrants is
likely to be sharply reduced by 1997-98.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 720,461 legal immigrants in FY95, including 507,000 family
unification immigrants, a sharp drop from 1993 and 1994.  The INS was accused
of releasing the FY95 immigration numbers late in March in support of efforts
to separate legal and illegal immigration, thus leaving the legal immigration
system intact, even though it expected an increase, to 650,000, in the number
of family unification immigrants in FY96.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS was sharply criticized for implying that legal immigration would
continue to decline when its internal projections showed that legal immigration
would increase.</tt><p>
<tt>Senator Simpson also proposed significant changes to systems through which
US employers secure permanent and temporary immigrants to fill vacant US
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Reaction</u>.  Several police organizations attacked a provision in the
House-approved immigration bill that would permit states to deny public
education to illegal alien children without cost.  President Clinton has
promised to veto any immigration bill that includes the denial of education
provision.</tt><p>
<tt>Senator Bob Dole (R-KS) supports the House provision, which mirrors Prop.
187's denial of K-12 schooling of illegal alien children.  House Speaker
Gingrich supported the measure in the House.  The Clinton administration has
also vowed to veto any immigration reform the Prop-187 measure excluding
illegal alien children from US public schools.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Immigrant
Beatings</a>, Numbers and
Naturalization</a></></a></h2>
<tt>On April 1, two white Riverside county sheriff's deputies were taped
beating two unauthorized Mexican aliens who had led them on an 80 mile
high-speed chase after trying to evade an Immigration and Naturalization
Service checkpoint in southern California.  The aliens who were beaten were in
the cab of a pickup truck that had 18 aliens crammed under a camper
shell.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS stopped chasing illegal immigrants attempting to evade them after a
1992 chase killed several innocent bystanders by a southern California
school.</tt><p>
<tt>On April 4, the two immigrants who were beaten filed a $70 million lawsuit
against Riverside county, and were offered a place to stay by actor Marlon
Brando.  The lawyer for one of the immigrants said that if the claim was
rejected, he would file suit in federal court alleging violations of the United
Nations' conventions against torture.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the Mexican migrants were from Cheran, an emigration village about
30,000 people in Michoacan, half-way between Guadalajara and Mexico City where
daily wages average $3 to $7.  An estimated 7,000 persons born in the village
are now in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>In another incident, a stolen camper with 26 unauthorized aliens crashed on
April 6 attempting to evade the Border Patrol, killing seven.  One of those
injured was a Mexican national being paid $200 to guide the illegal aliens
around a Border Patrol checkpoint to Los Angeles.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigrant rights groups protested the beatings, calling them the "Rodney
King" incident that may wake up the nation to violence against illegal
immigrants in the same way that the 1991 tape of police beating of King
illustrated police violence against African Americans.  Several groups asserted
that hate crimes and police beatings of immigrants have increased since Prop.
187 was approved by voters in November 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt>There were several demonstrations in Los Angeles, including a march of
6,000 people on April 6, 1996.  </tt><p>
<tt>A counter demonstration in support of law enforcement was organized by many
of the groups that supported Proposition 187.  They argued that immigration
rights advocates were trying to use the beatings to discourage Congress from
enacting new measures to curb illegal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>A member of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights said that the illegal
immigrants who were beaten had been promised work permits by federal
immigration officials.  The INS said that, like the case of the Thai workers
held in slavery conditions, the immigrants may be given work permits if they
are needed as material witnesses in the investigations.  The immigrants will be
allowed to remain in the country for six months while the investigation is
being conducted.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico took the lead in denouncing the beatings.  President Zedillo on
April 16 called the beatings on unauthorized aliens "totally unjustified," and
the protests in the US against the beatings "totally justified."  Zedillo
announced that he will ask for an international conference to endorse the human
rights of migrants and their families. </tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's Congress called for an exhaustive study of "aggressive violations
of human rights" in the US.  All four parties in the Mexican Congress passed
binding resolutions requiring the government to publish a detailed list of
human rights violations committed against Mexicans in the US over the past five
years.</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexican network Televisa led its newscasts with the beating story the
entire first week of April, and several Mexican politicians spoke of a US "war"
against Mexicans.  Mexican television commentators referred to those beaten not
as criminals, but as poverty-stricken people searching for work to care for
their families. </tt><p>
<tt>Other Mexicans said that Mexican anger should be directed against the
Mexican government, because it failed to create an economy that offers enough
jobs in Mexico.  On April 10, there was a videotaped police killing of Mexicans
in Olmedo, Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt>A poll taken April 8-9 by the Reforma newspaper found that 61 percent of
the respondents in Mexico City and Monterry were not satisfied with the
response of the Mexican government.  Almost half of the Mexicans polled do not
think that the US justice system will punish the Riverside County sheriff's
deputies. </tt><p>
<tt>The Reforma and El Norte newspapers conducted another poll April 13 to 17,
1996 of 465 Mexicans in Mexico who had been apprehended and removed from the US
by the INS. The poll found that 51 percent of the Mexicans described their
treatment by the INS as "good."  Another 34 percent said their treatment was
"regular;" some said that the INS agents had used abusive or disrespectful
language in dealing with them.</tt><p>
<tt>About 13 percent--one in eight--reported that they had been treated poorly;
their complaints included beatings and prolonged detention.  The questions were
asked on the Mexican side of the border as the Mexicans were returned from the
US.</tt><p>
<tt>The survey also asked Mexicans how they got into the US.  Most Mexicans
tried to enter the US without a smuggler-- 71 percent.  Most--67 percent--said
that they tried to enter the US illegally because they were jobless in Mexico,
and 36 percent were going to seek jobs in US agriculture, followed by 25
percent seeking jobs in construction.</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexicans polled as they were being returned from the US, reported that
they earned an average $278 per week in the US in their last job, versus $31
per week in their last Mexican job.  Almost all of the Mexicans apprehended
reported that they sent money to their families--they had an average four
dependents in Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt>The survey respondents reported that 61 percent of their US employers
treated them "well" or "very well," 32 percent said their treatment was
"regular," and only two percent reported US employer mistreatment.  Most of
those surveyed felt more comfortable in Mexico than in the US, primarily
because of their lack of English.</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexicans apprehended had an average 6.4 years of Mexican
education.</tt><p>
<tt>Representatives from Mexico and the US government agreed on April 14 to a
series of steps aimed at easing tensions at the US-Mexico border, including
reviews of police procedures in towns along the US side of the border, and a
continuation of presentations by Mexican officials to US Border Patrol
agents.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Enforcement</u>.   The INS reported that it had detained 1,176 foreign
workers  from 32 countries at more than 100 businesses between March 18 and
April 12 in 19 eastern states.</tt><p>
<tt>A report by the TransBorder Institute at the University of San Diego found
that most of the 540 San Diego residents responding to the telephone survey in
early March want to strengthen US border controls.  A slight majority of the
self-identified Republicans, and a substantial majority of the Democrats, would
provide social services to illegal immigrants.  Republicans favored employer
sanctions 8-to-1, while Democrats supported sanctions 3-to-1.  </tt><p>
<tt>In south Texas, the INS reported a ten-fold increase in December 1995 from
the usual 10 to 15 families each month that attempt illegal entry into the US
after smugglers advised entrants that the INS does not detain families.  Since
the mid-1980s, the INS has released into the US aliens apprehended with minor
children; even though most such aliens give false names and addresses and
disappear.  </tt><p>
<tt>As word of the INS policy spread, some adults "rented" children to ensure
that if caught by the INS, they would be released. </tt><p>
<tt>The INS is reporting increasing arrests and deportation from the country's
interior.  In March 1996, some 86 vehicles carrying 1,300 aliens were stopped
in Colorado during "Operation Mountain Pass."  As in other operations, the INS
stressed that it was going after the "inhumane" and exploitative smugglers, not
the employers where the aliens hoped to get jobs, or the aliens
themselves.</tt><p>
<tt>Over 1,000 illegal aliens were arrested during a sweep of 100 businesses in
the eastern United States between March 18 and April 12.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Department of Justice inspector general found that of the more than
half of the noncriminal illegal aliens apprehended in 1994 were still in the US
at the end of the year.  Based on a sampling of cases, the Department of
Justice estimates that the INS deported just 11 percent of the immigrants who
were not kept in custody after they were ordered deported.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS generally sends a letter requesting that the person appear for
deportation, the so-called "run letter." The INS blames its inability to deport
noncriminal aliens to insufficient resources to detain them.</tt><p>
<tt>The federal government has 41,000 law enforcement personnel, spread over 32
agencies, including 6,000 Border Patrol officers.  There are about 102,000
persons working in federal prisons.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Naturalization</u>.  The number of foreigners applying to become
naturalized US citizens increased from 340,000 in 1992 to 592,000 in 1994, and
is expected to top one million in 1995 and 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The immigration service expects one million applications in 1996.  The INS
launched a pilot program in Chicago in October 1995 to expedite the test that
immigrants must take to become naturalized US citizens.  Exams have multiple
choice questions, and oral interviews last 10 minutes.  Applicants are given
five sample multiple choice tests, a standardized list of 100 possible
questions, and a list of vocabulary study words.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">DOL
Reports on Temporary
Workers</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>The US Department of Labor's inspector general in April released an
12-state audit of DOL labor certification activities that concluded that
"foreign labor programs [that admit temporary and permanent immigrants to fill
vacant US jobs]...do not protect US workers' jobs or wages from foreign labor."
The audit recommends that the temporary foreign professionals program, the H-1B
program established by IMMACT in 1990, be abolished.</tt><p>
<tt>The US permits the entry of foreign workers to fill vacant jobs when US
workers are not available.  However, many labor economists have noted that it
is very difficult for the government to second-guess an employer who asserts
that a foreigner is more qualified to fill a vacancy than a US worker, so that
the US government typically establishes minimum wage and other criteria that a
US employer requesting foreign workers must satisfy, and then the government
depends on US worker complaints to ensure that employers live up to their
commitments.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Temporary</u>. The H-1B program came under attack in Congressional
hearings in 1995 (MN, October 1995), and in the DOL inspector general's report.
The H-1B program permits up to 65,000 "professionals" in "specialty
occupations" to enter the US each year for three years, and then their US
employers can request the renewal of H-1B work permits for another three years.
</tt><p>
<tt>US employers open the border gate to H-1B foreign workers by "attesting" in
a labor condition application filed with the Department of Labor that they have
tried and failed to find US citizens and legal immigrants by offering
prevailing wages.  DOL must approve their request for temporary foreign workers
unless it is "obviously inaccurate."   </tt><p>
<tt>The purpose of the program is to permit US employers "to meet urgent,
short-term demand for highly skilled, unique individuals who are not available"
in the US.  The jobs that H-1B foreign workers are imported to fill must
require professional skills, which is usually interpreted to mean that the
individual filling them must have a BS/BA--it is not enough that the foreign
worker has a BS/BA, the job must require such a degree.  This leads to
confusion in occupations such as nursing--many Filipinas have BS degrees, but
nursing in the US does not require a BS.</tt><p>
<tt>It is estimated that 40 percent of the new H-1B visa approvals are for
high-tech jobs such as computer programmers.  Enforcement depends largely on
complaints from competing US workers and businesses.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the inspector general's report, the H-1B is in reality "a
probationary employment tryout program for illegal aliens, foreign students,
and foreign visitors."  If the foreigners turn out to be good workers, then the
US employer often sponsors them for permanent immigrant status.  </tt><p>
<tt>In many cases, US employers do not pay the prevailing wages to the H-1B
workers that they promise in their attestations.  One company said that it was
offering US workers, and paying foreigners, $2,800 per month, but in fact paid
the foreigners it hired only $500 per month.  DOL is requiring 14 companies to
pay $2 million in back wages to 400 foreign physical therapists for wages that
they did not receive since 1989.</tt><p>
<tt>About 60,000 H-1B temporary foreign workers are admitted each year and,
because each H-1B can remain in the US for up to six years, there can be almost
400,000 H-1B workers in the US at any one time.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 43,000 visas issued by the US Department of State to H-1B
workers in FY94, and the INS reported that there were 106,000 admissions of
H-1B workers in FY94--an INS admission occurs each time that an H-1B worker
with a multi-year visa enters the US.</tt><p>
<tt>According to INS data, there were 186,000 temporary workers and trainees
admitted to the US in FY94, plus 43,000 spouses and children of these
workers.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Permanent.</u>  The US permits a maximum 140,000 immigrants (including
their family members) to come to the US each year for employment/economic
reasons.  An audit of employers who requested 24,000 permanent immigration
visas for foreigners to fill vacant jobs in FY93 found that 99 percent of the
foreigners were already in the US when the US employer requested the foreign
worker, and that 74 percent of the foreigners were already employed by the
employer requesting them, including 16 percent who were employed illegally by
their sponsoring employer.</tt><p>
<tt>About 10 percent of the foreigners who became permanent immigrants on the
grounds that no US worker was available to fill the vacant job ever worked for
the US employer who sponsored the foreigner, and 17 percent of those receiving
employment/economic immigration visas worked for less than six months with the
sponsoring employer.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 165,000 US workers applied for these 24,000 jobs when the employer
advertised as required--almost seven US applicants per job--but in virtually
every case, the US workers were found not qualified, and the foreigners were
hired.  The audit also found that although immigrants enter the US attached to
a specific job, once in the US, they look for more lucrative jobs competing
with US workers without regard to prevailing wages.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Wall Street Journal profiled George Borjas on April 26, 1996, a
Harvard-economist who emigrated from Cuba as a child and now advocates less
unskilled immigration.  The story summarized the Chiswick-Borjas debate over
whether immigrants catch up in earnings to similar US workers within 10 to 15
years--Chiswick found that those arriving prior to 1970 did catch up, Borjas
stresses that those who arrived after 1990 are unlikely to earn as much as
similar US-born residents. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Outlook. </u> Senators Simpson (R-WY) and Kennedy (D-MA) agreed with the
Clinton administration that major changes were needed in the H-1B and permanent
immigration for employment programs during Congressional hearings in 1995, but
a coalition of high-tech businesses and immigration advocates blocked proposed
changes.  </tt><p>
<tt>The House bill approved in March 1996 would require companies that
dismissed American workers to hire H-1B workers to pay the temporary foreign
replacement workers 10 percent more than the prevailing wage, and increase
fines for violations from the current $1,000 to $5,000 per violation.</tt><p>
<tt>There are 140,000 permanent immigrant visas available annually, and 123,000
permanent immigrant visas were issued to needed foreign workers  and their
dependents in FY94.   </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">California</a>:
Initiatives and
Wages</a></a</a></h2>
<tt>In California, one proposition qualified for the November 1996 ballot, and
one did not.  The California Civil Rights Initiative qualified for the ballot,
with over one million signatures, but the identification initiative, Save Our
State II, did not. </tt><p>
<tt>Save Our State II would have required all applicants for welfare payments
or other government benefits in California to present state-issued
identification cards proving their US citizenship or legal residency, all
persons born in California to be fingerprinted at birth, and all birth
certificates to contain information regarding the residency status of the
baby's mother.</tt><p>
<tt>In San Francisco, a proposed initiative to give noncitizens the right to
vote in local elections was prevented from circulating for signatures by a
judge who said that non-citizen voting would violate the California
constitution.  The judge's ruling seems to also invalidate a plan to permit
non-US citizen legal immigrants to vote in school board elections. </tt><p>
<tt>Supporters and proponents of unauthorized aliens in 1994 argued over its
likely effects on legal and illegal aliens, and in April, UC researchers
reported that young Latinos with mental illnesses in the Bay Area reduced by
one-fourth their outpatient clinic visits, and increased their usage of
emergency medical services.  </tt><p>
<tt>Bilingual education came under attack in many newspapers recently.  In many
schools, children who speak Spanish and other foreign languages are segregated
from other children.  Many school districts are beginning to immerse
non-English speaking students in English classes, and reporting that the
students learn English and other subjects faster than if they are placed in
classes in which math and other subjects are taught in their native
languages.</tt><p>
<tt>In California, state law requires non-English speaking children to be
taught in their own language until they learn enough English to transition into
regular classes taught in English.  However, the percentage of K-12 children
who transition from native language to regular classes has been falling--only
five percent of the California's limited English proficient students made the
move into regular classes in 1993.  </tt><p>
<tt>In some cases, parents of children placed in native-language classes have
protested that their children are not learning enough English to be
economically successful.</tt><p>
<tt>California has 1.2 million K-12 students who speak little or no English,
and on April 10, 1996, the Assembly Education Committee approved a bill that
would give local school districts the authority to decide how to integrate
non-English speaking children into regular classrooms.  MALDEF, the bilingual
teachers' association, and the California Department of Education are likely to
oppose giving local school districts more flexibility in deciding how to
integrate non-English speaking students.</tt><p>
<tt>In California, a union-led effort to raise the state's minimum wage from
$4.25 hourly to $5 on March 1, 1995, and to $5.75 on March 1, 1998, qualified
for the November 1996 ballot, and is expected to be approved by voters--a
January 1996 poll found that 84 percent of Americans favor raising the minimum
wage.  There are 43 states with state minimum wage laws, and 10 have
established minimum wages above the federal minimum wage, including Hawaii with
a minimum wage of $5.25 per hour.`</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 3.7 million US workers earning the $4.25 minimum wage--by
one estimate, they receive one percent of US wages--and 10 million more who
earn $4.25 to $5.15 per hour--including 1.5 million in California.  About 54
percent of the minimum wage workers are under 25, including 37 percent of those
under 20.</tt><p>
<tt>It appears that the Republican-dominated Congress will permit a vote on
raising the minimum wage to $5.25 by 1998 in May 1996, and that this increase
will be approved.</tt><p>
<tt>The 72 Thai workers found to be imprisoned in a Los Angeles sweatshop in
August 1995 have received $1 million in wages from their former
employers--seven Thais--and the clothing companies that bought the clothes sewn
there.  Lawyers for the 72 workers are seeking $5 million in civil suits
against retailers who bought clothes from the sweatshop.  Two of the operators
of the sweatshop were sentenced to prison in April 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>After peaking at 20.2 million in 1993, the number of California driver's
licenses fell to 19.1 million in 1995.  Usually, one driver's license
represents two people in the states, so this data would suggest that 2.2
million people left the state.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration is among the explanations offered for the apparent discrepancy
between the increased number of residents and jobs and the decreased number of
driver's licenses.  A 1994 California law required applicants for driver's
licenses to show proof that they are legal US residents.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC6">Florida's
Growth,
Arizona</a><a>'s
Prop. 187</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Florida is currently the fourth most populous state, with 14 million
residents, and is projected to grow to 17-18 million by 2010, and to 22 million
by 2020.  According to a new study from the Center for Immigration Studies,
immigrants and their children account for 30 percent of the state's population
growth.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 45 percent of Dade County's two million residents were born abroad,
making Dade County the US county with the highest percentage of foreign born
residents--almost 30 percent of the county's residents are not US citizens.
The county's residents include 669,000 persons of Cuban origin; 110,000,
Haitians; 74,000, Nicaraguans; 54,000, Colombians; 23,000, Mexicans; 23,000,
Dominicans; 18,000, Hondurans, and; 16,000, Peruvians.</tt><p>
<tt>Miami is the only large US city with an Hispanic majority, and most of the
20,000 Cubans permitted to enter the US each year settle in Miami.  There are
sometimes tensions between US-born Blacks and Haitians because the Haitians are
doing better--the unemployment rate in Little Haiti is 42 percent, but that is
still lower than in nearby African-American neighborhoods.</tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 400,000 illegal immigrants in Florida (compared to
some two million in California), and Florida voters are expected to vote on an
initiative similar to California's Proposition 187 in November 1996 that would
deny many social services and education to illegal aliens.  Democratic Gov.
Lawton Chiles opposes the measure, although Florida sued the federal government
in April 1994 for $1 billion per year to cover it said represented the costs to
the state of providing services to illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>According to INS, about 45 percent of the 33,000 aliens apprehended in
Florida since 1992 said they were smuggled into the US.</tt><p>
<tt>A campaign to place a Prop. 187-type initiative on the November 1996
Arizona ballot began in March, 1996.  The proposed measure would cut off all
government aid to illegal immigrants.  </tt><p>
<tt>Ron Prince, who chaired California's Prop. 187 campaign, moved to Arizona
to coordinate the efforts there.  Organizers need 112,961 signatures by July 3,
1996 in order to place the measure on the ballot.  </tt><p>
<tt>On March 25, the US Supreme Court agreed to hear in the fall of 1996 an
appeal by Arizonians for Official English to reinstate the Arizona
constitutional amendment that would make English the official government
language.  The amendment was approved by Arizona voters as in 1988.</tt><p>
<tt>The Arizona amendment, Article 28, was challenged by a state employee who
wrote her reports in Spanish for a non-English speaking supervisor, and federal
courts in 1990 and 1995 held that the amendment violated the first amendment
free speech rights of public employees and the people they serve.</tt><p>
<tt>Arizona decided not to appeal these court decisions, so the appeal is being
carried by Arizonians for Official English.  A Supreme Court ruling could deal
with the validity of English-only amendments in the 21 states with them, and
with the right of private groups to sue to enforce initiatives that states
decide not to defend.</tt><p>

<tt>In 1995, about 3,300 aliens arrived in the US without documents and sought
asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigrant rights groups argued that the "enter illegally" provisions that
could lead to exclusion from the US might be used to exclude millions of aliens
apprehended after illegal entry.  Most of the aliens apprehended by the Border
Patrol are fingerprinted and photographed, and then allowed to "voluntarily
return" to Mexico.  Under some interpretations of the anti-terrorism bill, an
asylum officer could exclude such aliens from the US without offering them a
deportation hearing, the current practice.</tt><p>
<tt>A deportation hearing is a more formal judicial proceeding in which the
burden of proof is on the US government to show why the alien should not be
allowed to stay in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 1, the Senate by a 51 to 49 vote substituted Attorney General
discretion for the terrorism and Simpson bills' summary exclusion provisions.
The Senate-approved amendment would permit administrative review of an asylum
officer's decision to exclude an asylum seeker who arrives without documents.
The House-approved bill permits summary exclusion, so the issue will be decided
in the House-Senate conference committee.</tt><p>
<tt>As the anti-terrorism law went into effect in late April, the INS began
detaining illegal aliens who had been convicted of crimes in the US as they
left prison.  Past practice was to allow such aliens to post bond while they
appealed deportation orders, and permitted immigration judges to permit the
aliens to remain in the US if they were in the US at least seven years and have
employment and family ties here.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Chinese women who object to the one-child policy have been able to win
asylum in the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>On May 2, 1996, the US Board of Immigration Appeals will hear the appeal of
an African woman who in 1994 requested asylum in the US because she would have
faced genital mutilation in her native Togo.  Foreigners can request asylum in
the US if they face a well-founded fear of persecution because of their race,
religion, nationality, political opinions or membership in a social group; the
woman argues that she is part of a social group--women who oppose genital
mutilation.</tt><p>
<tt>After front page stories in the New York Times on this case, the woman was
released from detention April 24.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton Administration filed a brief in support of providing asylum for
women who have a credible fear of being forced to undergo genital mutilation as
adults.  </tt><p>
<tt>The World Health Organization estimates that 85 million to 114 million
girls and women have been mutilated in 26 African nations. The board's ruling
in this case will be binding on the nation's 179 immigration judges, who have
been divided in their handling of such cases.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, the Clinton Administration told immigration officers that they
could  postpone indefinitely the deportation of women who faced forced
abortions in China, but the Board of Immigration Appeals ruled that such fear
cannot justify asylum--30 Chinese women have been affected by this policy.
</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, guidelines were issued to help immigration officers identify women
who should get asylum because sexual violence were issued, and three women have
so far been granted asylum for fear of genital mutilation.  In March 1996,
battered spouses of US citizens were allowed to apply for immigrant status on
their own.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC8">Independent
Mexic</a>an
Unions</a></></a></h2>
<tt>Industrial wages in Mexico are equivalent to only 50 percent of their 1982
level, but the number of strikes in Mexico is still very low--there were over
600 strikes in Mexico in 1982, 300 in 1986, but only 50 in 1995.  The Mexican
CTM, an integral part of the PRI, has five million members in 14,000 affiliated
unions--one in seven deputies in the Mexican Chamber of Deputies is a CTM
official.</tt><p>
<tt>Independent unions are becoming more aggressive.  They have about 500,000
members, but they accounted for 25 percent of all strikes in Mexico in 1995.
Some 40 independent unions have formed the Coordinator of Mexican
Workers.</tt><p>
<tt>On April 11, the semi-official Labor Congress said that it may expel nine
unions for planning an unauthorized march May 1 to protest government economic
policies, including the teachers, telephone workers, and electricians unions;
they are about 12 percent of the CTM's membership.  The CTM canceled its May 1
march, fearing unrest because of Mexico's economic crisis. </tt><p>
<tt>A new book, Bordering on Chaos, argues that Mexico could descend into
economic stagnation that would propel millions of Mexicans northward.</tt><p>
<tt>Tecun Uman, a town of 20,000 also known as Guatemala's Tijuana because of
the Central Americans who congregate there to sneak into Mexico and, often, to
the US, is reportedly filled with Central Americans who have suffered
mistreatment at the hands of the Mexican police.  One 1995 report said that
two-thirds of the migrants who had been apprehended in Mexico reported that
they were mistreated or beaten by Mexican authorities.</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexican and US governments are apparently taking quiet steps to
cooperate in areas that have long been sources of tension.  For example, in
April 1996, Mexico for the first time approved US requests to extradite Mexican
nationals accused of committing crimes in the US.  According to one
commentator, the Mexican government is changing from automatically saying no to
US initiatives to embracing some of them.</tt><p>
<tt>In April, 63 Mexicans apprehended in the US were flown from San Diego to
Guadalajara, and another 450 are expected to be flown to the interior of Mexico
by July 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico announced in April that foreign firms will not be able to manage the
new private pension funds that are being established to bail out the bankrupt
public pension system.  In Chile, foreign firms manage about 70 percent of the
private pension funds.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC9">Central
American</a>/a></a>
Immigrants</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The seven countries of Central America south of Mexico are smaller, poorer,
and more rural than Mexico.  They sent about 40,000 legal immigrants to the US
in FY94--the highest rates of emigration were from Belize and El Salvador, and
the lowest was from Costa Rica.  Over 90 percent of the 1.1 million Central
American immigrants who arrived in the US since 1820 came in the last 15 years,
versus 60 percent of the Mexican immigrants.  According to unofficial
estimates, over 400,000 Central Americans enter Mexico with the intend of
traveling on to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico expels more than 70,000 illegal aliens across the Guatemalan border
each year.  Over 65 percent of the migrants arriving illegally in Mexico report
"ill treatment, beatings and threats at the hands of the authorities,"
according the official Mexican human rights commission.</tt><p>
<tt>To pass through Mexico, Central Americans must travel hundreds of miles
during a journal that can take up to three months. The cost of hiring a
smuggler to guide them through Mexico ranges from $300 to $10,000.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many of the Central Americans entering Mexico become seasonal farm workers
in Chiapas.  The children of undocumented workers born in Mexico can not
receive birth certificates making it impossible to register them for school.
Mexico also denies non-emergency health care to illegal immigrants and their
children. </tt><p>
<tt>More Central Americans filed asylum cases in the US in FY94 than
immigrated, suggesting that, unlike Mexicans, many Central Americans arrive as
tourist non-immigrants and then seek to remain in the US by applying for
asylum.  </tt><p>
<tt>Several candidates for election in Nicaragua traveled to California in
early March to raise money for their campaigns among the estimated 500,000
Nicaraguans in the US.  The 1990 Census counted 203,000 Nicaraguans in the
US.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC11">EU--Illegal
and Internal
Migration</a></a</a></h2>
<tt>Europol has declared "organized illegal immigration" to be the police<b>
</b>organization's "greatest concern."  In several countries, officials who
were assigned to go after alien smugglers have been accused of protecting them,
including several French immigration officers at Orly airport, and immigration
officials in Hamburg.  </tt><p>
<tt>Europol blames the corruption on the amount of money that can be collected
from aliens who want to enter Western Europe.  Local police can also earn a
payoff from the criminal activities--such as prostitution and drug
dealing--that many of the foreigners can be induced to engage in once they
arrive.</tt><p>
<tt>A push by the Netherlands for a collective visa, asylum and immigration
policy and a wider role for the European Court of Justices has the support of
14 of the EU member states--all but Britain.  An EU immigration policy was on
the agenda for the first of a series EU's Inter-Governmental Conferences in
Turin, Italy.  The IGC will seek to reform EU institutions and revise the 1991
Maastricht treaty.</tt><p>
<tt>After five years of debate, EU employment ministers on March 29 agreed on
the rights of EU nationals sent by their firms to work in another EU nation.
So-called "posted workers" are different from workers who cross borders on
their own to seek jobs, as e.g. Italians who migrate to Germany to seek work at
BMW, and also different from self-employed persons such as accountants who want
to offer their services in another EU nation.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the freedom of services clause of the EU treaty, many German
construction firms established subsidiaries or relationships with firms in the
UK and Portugal, hired workers there, and "posted" them to Berlin, Europe's
largest construction site, at wages that were one-fourth of prevailing German
wages.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the EU directive, EU workers posted in another EU country must
usually be paid the same wages as local workers from the first day of their
employment abroad, although countries can permit lower wages for the first
month.  Postings that last less than eight days would be exempt.  EU member
nations have two years to approve national implementing legislation.</tt><p>
<tt>The European Court of Justice ruled that unemployed persons who take cash
settlements when they are laid off, can still collect family benefits.  The
ruling came as the result of a case in which a Spanish worker who had lived and
worked in Germany for 26 years, took a lump sum payment when he was laid off,
and lost his unemployment benefits.  </tt><p>
<tt>The court ruled that community law on social security benefits does not
distinguish between those receiving monthly unemployment benefits from those
who take a lump sum, and are therefore considered temporarily suspended from
receiving unemployment benefits by their national governments.</tt><p>
<tt>The EU labor force of 2010 is projected to rise to 180 million, and
employment to 166 million, leaving 14 million unemployed.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC12">Germany</a>:
Bosnians, Kurds, and
Construction</a>/a></a></h2>
<tt><u>Bosnians</u>.  There are about 320,000 Bosnians living in Germany, and
they are scheduled to begin to return to Bosnia on July 1, 1996.  A poll
commissioned by the UNHCR found that 25 percent of the Bosnians in German are
ready to return, but 45 percent of the Bosnians in Germany do not feel
conditions are right for their return--an estimated 60 percent of the housing
in Bosnia has been destroyed or damaged.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany has spent an estimated $10 billion on Bosnians.</tt><p>
<tt>Single Bosnians in Switzerland lost their "temporary protected status" on
April 30, 1996, and have four months to leave the country.  Families will lose
TPS April 30, 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The Netherlands has 45,000 Bosnians and Denmark has 17,500.</tt><p>
<tt>The German government announced on April 17 that it would send 150
policemen to Bosnia to assist the UN multinational police force deployed there.
The multinational police force will be composed of 1,700 policemen from over 30
countries. </tt><p>
<tt>Germany also provides temporary protected status for 120,000 ethnic
Albanians from Serbia.</tt><p>
<tt>The Federal Interior Ministry announced that 9,121 foreigners sought asylum
in March 1996, continuing the 10,000 per month pace set so far in 1996.  Most
were nationals of Turkey, Yugoslavia (Montenegro and Serbia), and Iraq, but
there were also 140 asylum requests from Bosnians.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 7.1 million foreigners in Germany on January 1, 1996, including
2.2 million wage and salary workers.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Aussiedler</u>.  Even though the number of ethnic Germans arriving in
Germany fell to 41,000 in the first three months of 1996, Germany continued to
debate the number of ethnic German Aussiedler that can be absorbed.  Germany
has since 1993 limited the number of Aussieder to 220,000 each year.  Upon
their arrival in Germany, Aussiedler get German language instruction, are
eligible for pensions, and become German citizens upon request. </tt><p>
<tt>About 40,000 Jews from the ex-USSR have migrated to Germany, and another
73,000 more have applied to emigrate.  One survey found that 70 percent were
university graduates, but 30 percent were jobless.  There were about 30,000
Jews in Germany until 1989.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Expulsions.</u> On March 26, the political parties in the Kohl
government discussed whether laws should be changed to permit the expulsion of
foreigners involved in illegal demonstrations.  The CDU and CSU want to give
the government the authority to immediately expel foreigners who seriously
disturb the peace (schwerer Landfriedensbruch) without first obtaining a
criminal conviction.</tt><p>
<tt>Also discussed was a reduction from five to three years the penalty that
permits foreigners to be expelled from Germany for non-political crimes.</tt><p>
<tt>The Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK has reportedly made "revenge" death
threats against German chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel.  A trial is underway in Stuttgart involving alleged PKK members who
firebombed Turkish establishments in Germany in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>A study by the Turkish Studies Center in Essen reported that "blind
testing"--sending similarly qualified Turks and Germans for jobs--found that
Germans were preferred to Turks, especially in retail trade and construction.
Under Germany's anti-discrimination laws, the burden of proof is on the alien
who charges that he suffered discrimination.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Construction/Economics</u>.  German building unions and employers agreed
to a 1.85 percent wage increase on April 11, averting what would have been the
first construction strike since World War II.  The wage increases went into
effect April 1 in the former East Germany, and September 1, 1996 in East
Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>Wage increases won by unions in 1995 averaged double the rate of
inflation.</tt><p>
<tt>On April 17, the Bundesbank reported that Germany's construction industry,
which has been booming for the past five years, is set for a period of
consolidation.  German building groups say that business has begun to taper off
amid tough competition from low-wage foreign competitors. </tt><p>
<tt>Under a new law, EU workers sent by their employers to Germany must be paid
at least minimum wages DM 18.60 marks ($12.40) per hour in former West Germany,
and DM17.11 marks ($11.4) in East Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>The German labor force in 1996 is 34.4 million, and unemployment was 4.1
million in March 1996, or 10.8 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>In one in 10 German families, both parents are unemployed.  The Federal
Labor Office in Germany reported on March 6 that the unadjusted unemployment
rate in the west rose to 9.6 percent from 9.4 percent in January.  In eastern
Germany, the unemployment rate was 17.5 in February, up from 16.8 percent in
January.  The combined data for eastern and western Germany shows unemployment
at 11.1 percent in February, up from 10.8 percent in January.</tt><p>
<tt>Economists blame some of the rise in unemployment on the exceptionally cold
weather in February, and the tendency of construction employers to lay off
workers and have them collect UI benefits rather than making privately funded
"bad weather" payments.</tt><p>
<tt>The Bundesbank reported that social support--akin to US General
Assistance-- doubled from DM 21 billion in 1985 to DM 43 ($29) billion in 1994.
Social support is the paid as a last resort to guarantee a minimum living
standard to the disabled (Hilfe in besonderen Lebenslagen) and to persons
capable of working (Hilfe zum Lebensunterhalt)--about two-thirds of the social
assistance is paid to "besondere Lebenslagen" disabled persons.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1993, about 1.5 million persons in the former West Germany received
Lebensunterhalt, and almost half of them were foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>Local governments pay about three-quarters of the social support and the
increase has made it difficult for them to reduce their budget deficits.  In
former west Germany, payments remained steady for asylum seekers in 1994
because of a change in the rules governing benefits.  In 1995, welfare benefit
payments by municipalities increased by 9.4 percent in all of Germany. </tt><p>
<tt>The Kohl government announced plans at the end of April to reduce social
spending by $16 billion in 1997, largely by reducing social assistance
payments.  For example, sick pay, which is currently 100 percent of a worker's
salary for six weeks, would be cut by 20 percent, and the retirement age for
women would be raised from 60 to 63.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC13">French
Commission Recommends Immigration
Restrictions</a>/a></a></h2>
<tt>A parliamentary commission on April 21 called for a tightening of the
country's immigration laws in order to reduce the "temptations" of France to
unauthorized foreigners.  Estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in
France range from 250,000 to 600,000, with suggestions that their number
increases by 30,000 per year.</tt><p>
<tt>The Sauvaigo commission's 46 recommendations include restricting the access
of illegal aliens to free health care and education, finger-printing visa
applicants from some countries, and holding suspected illegal immigrants for up
45 days to facilitate deportation--in many cases, police cannot identify and
thus deport aliens under the current 10 day detention limit.</tt><p>
<tt>The commission recommended that employers of illegal workers should be made
to pay for their repatriation, and called for creation of a computerized
register of anyone offering lodging or hospitality to foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>The 30 member commission made its recommendations on a 26-4 vote, with the
Socialist members dissenting.</tt><p>
<tt>The government was divided in its reactions to the report-- the French
minister for humanitarian assistance said it contained "unacceptable and
scandalous" ideas.  </tt><p>
<tt>The government announced that it had apprehended 2,000 illegal foreign
workers in 1995.  So far in 1996, police raided 114 illegal workshops in
Paris.</tt><p>
<tt>Some questioned the constitutionality of the recommendations.  The National
Front endorsed the recommendations, but said they did not go far enough--it
calls for the repatriation of 3 million immigrants to their countries of origin
and for the re-examination of 2.5 million naturalizations granted since 1974.
A recent poll found that 28 percent of the French supported the National Front,
up from 19 percent in January 1994.   </tt><p>
<tt>The United Nations Human Rights Commission criticized France on April 11
for the "wave of xenophobia and racism" sweeping the country, criticizing the
"Pasqua laws" enacted in 1993 that prevent the deportation of foreigners
married to French nationals, and the parents of children born in France, but do
not grant some of these foreigners work or residence visas.  The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights was signed in Paris in 1948.</tt><p>
<tt>The first week of April, Amnesty International issued a report that charged
French police with cruelty and ill-treatment of foreigners. </tt><p>
<tt>A group of African immigrants were shuttled from a church to a gym to a
theater to avoid deportation from France--the police were asked to remove the
Africans from the church by Catholic Church authorities.  Some of the Africans
were deported to Mali; in one case, Malians attacked the police who accompanied
them after the plane landed.</tt><p>
<tt>France returned more than more than 10,000 foreigners to their countries of
origin in 1995.  A plane returning a drug trafficker to the Congo had to make
an emergency landing in Marseille after passengers attacked the policemen
accompanying the trafficker for not removing his handcuffs.</tt><p>
<tt>Of the 21,170 applicants for political asylum in France in 1995, about 16
percent or 3,400 were accepted as refugees, including 16 of 2200 Algerian
applicants.  There were 26,000 asylum applications in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>France announced in March 1996 that it would remove border checks on
persons coming from Schengen partners Germany and Spain, but continue to check
persons coming from the Benelux until an agreement on drugs is reached with the
Netherlands.</tt><p>
<tt>France's population rose from 40 million to 58 million since World War II,
and 25 percent of the increase was due to immigration.  The immigrants included
1.5 million expatriates who returned to France from overseas colonies after
1956, including 650,000 from Algeria.</tt><p>
<tt>The percentage of foreigners in France has been about 6.5 percent since
1970, the level reached in 1931 after a wave of immigration by foreign workers
in the 1920s.</tt><p>
<tt>On April 24, the French government announced new measures to use computers
to control health care costs, another effort to rein in the rising costs of the
social welfare state.  Current French law permits individuals to choose their
doctors, with the government picking up most of the costs.  Efforts to reduce
pensions for government workers set off strikes.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Integration.</u> Roubaix, a city in northern France that is one third of
immigrant origin, was in the news because of a bombing outside police
headquarters that prompted a chase and shoot out that ended in Belgium. </tt><p>
<tt>Many of the immigrants first came to Roubaix to work in the textile
industry.  Over the past 30 years, the textile industry has disappeared, and
there are few jobs for second generation immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>City officials say it was a mistake to concentrate the immigrations in one
area, where extremism can take root .  In Alma-Gare, near the site of the gun
fight, most women are veiled and the adolescent boys often were Arafat-style
headgear.  Young people of North African background complain that they are not
"treated properly" by the French and not been given an equal chance--hence
their turn to fundamentalist Islam. </tt><p>
<tt>A government commission chaired by National Assembly member Henri Cuq
recommended that some high-rise apartment complexes that house immigrants be
destroyed because they are crime and health hazards.  About 150,000 immigrants,
most from north and west Africa, live in France's 710 high-rise hostels.  Most
are run by subsidized associations or state agencies.</tt><p>
<tt>The report said that 25 hostels, most in the Paris area, should be
destroyed within the next five years.  Others should be rehabilitated, with new
controls to keep out illegal residents.  Some hostels reportedly hold three
times as many residents as they should. </tt><p>
<tt>The hostels reportedly hamper integration because the immigrants are kept
isolated from French society.  Some managers of the hostels have given
authority to African elders, who run the hostels according to tribal rules.
</tt><p>
<tt><u>Overseas.</u>  On April 12, Prime Minister Alain Juppe said he would
increase efforts to prevent illegal immigration into French Guyana, France's
only South American possession.  Juppe said he planned to build a detention
center in St. Laurent, and to increase patrols on the nation's eastern border
with Brazil.  Illegal aliens, primarily from Brazil, Haiti and Surinam, make up
an estimated 25 percent of French Guyana's population of 150,000, and that
16,000 foreigners were expelled to Surinam.</tt><p>
<tt>St. Laurent was used by France from the mid-19th century until 1946 as the
center of its Devil's Island penal colony complex.  Unemployment in French
Guyana is 23 percent, and half of its economy is directly linked to a rocket
base in Ariane. </tt><p>

<tt>Greece plans to offer legal status to the 250,000 to 500,000 illegal
Albanians in the country, part of friendship agreement signed by the two
countries in March 1996.  Albania will allow the establishment of Greek schools

<tt>Greece accused Turkey of harboring "slave traders" on April 18, after a
Turkish boat allegedly dropped off eight illegal Iranian immigrants on a Greek
island--the Iranians had paid $1,000 to $4,000 each.  A Greek patrol boat fired
warning shots into the air; Turkey claimed that the incident took place in
Turkish waters, and that a fisherman was wounded. </tt><p>
<tt>The incident aggravated antagonism between Greece and Turkey regarding the
ownership of several small islands in the Aegean Sea.  A Greek government
spokesperson said that illegal immigration from Turkey to these islands was a
serious problem.  Between 1992 and 1995, Greece says that 22,906 illegal
immigrants entered Greece via Turkey, plus 9,590 so far in 1996.  </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC15">Ital</a>ian
Candidates Ignore Immigration Issue</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>In the run-up to Italy's elections on April 21, the mainstream parties --
the center-right Freedom Alliance and center-left Olive Tree -- did not discuss
immigration, despite almost daily reports of ships attempting to smuggle aliens
into Italy catching fire or running aground.  Both major alliances argued that
debating immigration would only help the extreme right.</tt><p>
<tt>The leftist Olive Tree alliance won 169 of the 315 seats in the Italian
Senate, and 324 of 630 seats in the Lower House.   The Olive Tree publicly
supports migrant rights, arguing that Italy must become multi-racial and
multi-cultural society.  The National Alliance and the Northern League, on the
other hand, want to apprehend and expel illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Italy will come under increasing pressure from France and other EU nations
to control illegal immigration when it becomes a full member of the Schengen
agreement.  European Union members Denmark, Finland and Sweden, and non-members
Norway and Iceland, will become observers at Schengen meetings as of May
1.</tt><p>
<tt>Italy's has 922,706 legal migrants -- including 141,000 from EU nations,
and they are about 1.6 percent of the population.  The number of illegal
immigrants was dramatically cut in March 1996, from around 500,000 to about
200,000, after the immigration law was changed in November, 1995 to allow the
immediate deportation of illegal immigrants who break the law, and the rapid
expulsion of those who do not have the right papers.</tt><p>
<tt>Thousands of illegal immigrants reportedly went to police stations on March
31 in order to try to legalize their status before a new "immediate
deportation" law went into effect on April 1, 1996.  Illegal immigrants with
regular jobs but without legal status were allowed to regularize their status.

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC18">Vietnamese
Boat
People</a></></a></h2>
<tt>Over one million Vietnamese "boat people" have been resettled since 1975,
including 823,000 in the US, 137,000 each in Australia and Canada, 96,000 in
France, and 19,000 each in the UK and Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>On April 20, a Malaysian navy ship transported 317 Vietnamese boat people
to Vietnam in the first of four forced repatriations by ship planned for the
next two months.  Once offloaded, the returnees are taken to reception centers
for screening before being returned to their home villages. </tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian navy will transport 1,765 Vietnamese over the next two
months.  The remaining 1,363 will be returned by air.  Malaysia offers
Vietnamese in camps an easy two hour flight home if they volunteer, or forcible
return on a boat.</tt><p>
<tt>Other Asian countries have avoided sending Vietnamese boat people back by
ship-- some critics have branded them prison ships.  The Malaysian government
has speeded up the return of Vietnamese boat people because it plans to shut
down its two remaining detention camps by June 30, when the UNHCR stops funding
them.</tt><p>
<tt>The Comprehensive Plan of Action for dealing with people leaving Vietnam by
boat was adopted in 1989.  Since then, some 80,000 boat people were recognized
as refugees and resettled elsewhere, 500,000 left Vietnam legally as immigrants
under the Orderly Departure Program, and 115,000 Vietnamese left their country
in boats, landed in nearby countries, and hoped to be selected to resettle in a
third country as refugees.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the 115,000 were determined not to be refugees and were returned to
Vietnam, but 35,000 remained in camps in April 1996, including 19,200 in Hong
Kong, 4,800 in Thailand, 4,300 in Indonesia, and 3,700 in Malaysia.  The camps
have been closed to visitors so that they can be emptied by June 30,
1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Local events sometimes make it difficult for the Vietnamese in the camps to
return to Vietnam quietly.  For example, the Philippines government announced
plans to close a camp holding 2,000 Vietnamese by June 30, 1996, but after
forcibly returning several Vietnamese, the government came under pressure from
the Catholic church not to force the Vietnamese into airplanes to send them
home.</tt><p>
<tt>In Hong Kong, Britain's Privy Council ruled that 15 Vietnamese should go
freed because Hanoi was unlikely to take them back--all were ethnic Chinese
with Taiwanese travel documents.  This raised hopes that other ethnic Chinese
could avoid a return to Vietnam. </tt><p>
<tt>The Privy Council's decision forced the Hong Kong legislature to table
discussion of the new Immigration Bill amendment, which would have given the
government the power to indefinitely and arbitrarily detain Vietnamese boat
people.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Vietnamese government says it can handle up to 3,600 returning
Vietnamese each month.  Each returning person is screened; Vietnam has refused
to take hundreds of the people back on the grounds that they are foreign
nationals or are ethnically not Vietnamese.</tt><p>
<tt>In Vietnam, most reports are that two-thirds of returned boat people have
restarted their lives, with the help of cash grants of about $1,000 for a
family from the United Nations and European Union, and grants for the
communities they return to minimize local jealousy.

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC19">Chin</a>ese
Crackdown</a> on Migrants</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>China began a nationwide crackdown on illegal overseas workers on May 1.
Under new regulations, foreigners must obtain work permits from their local
labor department and residential permits from public security departments.
Foreign workers already living in China have until June 30 to secure the
necessary permits.  Foreign workers who fail to get the necessary permits could
be fined or deported. </tt><p>
<tt>The regulations will affect every one from diplomatic spouses to foreign
prostitutes, claims a Beijing labor official.  There are 170,000 foreigners
working in China-- 70,000 are employed by government organizations, and 100,000
by foreign institutions or overseas-funded ventures. </tt><p>
<tt>The Chinese government also announced new regulations to regulate internal
migration for employment.  The Project of Orderly Trans-regional Migration of
Rural Laborers requires workers wishing to find work outside their home towns
to obtain a permit from the local authority, as well as a certificate from the
authorities in the destination--cities with high unemployment will be
off-limits to migrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the new rules, migrants will not be allowed to look for work in major
cities already impacted by internal migrants.  The government plans to attempt
to induce workers to stay put by providing more jobs in government-subsidized
projects in underdeveloped areas.  The government hopes this new undertaking
will limit the number of migrants to about 30 million in 1996 and 40 million by
the year 2000.</tt><p>
<tt>The Chinese Ministry of Labor estimates that 12.5 percent or 30 million of
China's rural workers are employed outside their places of origin.  Other
estimates place the number of internal migrants as high as 80 to 100
million.</tt><p>
<tt>Chinese economists argue that the migrant labor force has been a boon to
the economy, but the large transient population is blamed for increased crime
and social instability-- 649,000 transients, registered as temporary residents
in urban areas, were apprehended for committing crimes in 1995. </tt><p>
<tt>Observers say that China's migrant problem will likely worsen in the next
several years because nearly 130 million farmers in rural areas are now
redundant due to population increases and encroachment on farm land by
development projects. </tt><p>
<tt>Beijing opened a recruitment center for migrant workers in the West Railway
Station, the first step to regularize the flow of an estimated three million
migrant workers employed by some 2,900 enterprises and private businesses.
Central Beijing has about three million residents, and another eight million
people live in the metro area.</tt><p>
<tt>As the men go to the cities to find jobs, more Chinese women are left to
run the farms.  Researchers are finding that the status of women farmers is
increasing, along with their income.  In northern Shaanxi, one women began
helped local women farmers establish an apple industry.  The woman's family
income was $3,500, compared to the national average of $190.  Chinese farming
women still face discrimination in government programs developed for male heads
of households.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are 1.2 billion people in China, and 45 percent are under 26.</tt><p>
<tt>The Chinese government announced plans to move about 500,000 Chinese
workers into mining towns in Tibet.  Official Chinese figures place Tibet's
population at about 2.4 million, 90 percent ethnic Tibetans.  Unofficial data
suggest that the increasing number of Chinese traders and workers has pushed
the Chinese population to 150,000, with the urban population primarily Han
Chinese. </tt><p>
<tt>The influx of Han Chinese into Tibet is expected in increase ethnic
tensions because the Tibetans resent any incursion into their country by China.
The Chinese government responded that the purpose of the mining program that is
bringing Chinese to Tibet is to develop the economy, not encourage immigration.
</tt><p>
<tt>The Han Chinese in Tibet will be paid three to four times more than in
China because of a hardship allowance. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC20">Malaysia
Foreign Workers Are Security
Threat</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Malaysian government is calling foreign workers a national security
threat.  One Malaysian official said Malaysia needs to learn from the
experiences of Germany and France. </tt><p>
<tt>Malaysian officials estimate that there are over one million foreign
workers in the country, about one-eight of their work force.  Most of the
foreign workers are from Indonesia and the Philippines, and they work on
plantations, construction sites and in factories.  About 500,000 are illegal.
</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia's new five-year plan, unveiled in mid-April, included a call for
the growth of capital-intensive and high-wage industries, including aerospace,
electronics, information technology, education services, and biotechnology, to
increase incomes and to curb labor shortages.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian minister for human resources blames employer unwillingness to
provide housing for their workers as a reason immigrants are setting up illegal
settlements on government reserve land.  In the Malaysian state of Selangor,
there were about 343,000 foreign worker squatters.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1988, 23 settlements with sizable Indonesian populations were identified
in the Klang Valley.  In Kuala Lumpur, immigrants were found in 56 squatter
settlements in 1989.  Indonesians were seven percent of the capital's estimated
squatter population of over 180,000.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government is planning to raze all squatters' settlements on
government land.  The Malaysian government in April 1996 also began requiring
employers to provided housing for migrant workers to discourage squatting, and
announced that it is increasing the number of enforcement personnel responsible
for demolishing the squatters' settlements.</tt><p>
<tt>The Indonesian Embassy requested extra time before Indonesian camps are
razed so that the Indonesian foreign workers could find other housing.</tt><p>
<tt>One editorial in the New Straits Times said that, although the demolition
of squatter settlements is heart-wrenching, it must be done to protect the
county's law-abiding citizens.  The editorial also criticized the government
for giving ex-squatters preferential treatment to receive low cost
housing.</tt><p>
<tt>University of Malaya anthropologist Azizah Kassim says that Malaysia has
the largest foreign work force among Asean countries, with between 14 and 15
percent of the population foreign in 1995.  She estimates that there are over
half a million legal foreign workers, and between 500,000 and 700,000 illegal
foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government has been trying to register illegal foreign
workers through various amnesty programs, but the programs have not been very
successful.  One reason is that it costs an Indonesian worker in Malaysia about
RM460 ($185) to get a job through official channels, and only RM 70 through a
labor broker.  In addition, illegal workers are not tied to one job and
employer.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysian officials assert that illegal settlements aggravate education,
housing and health problems. Azizah found that the ready availability of
foreign workers makes it hard for trade unions to increase wages and improve
conditions.  If Malaysia were to experience a recession, there could be mass
expulsions, as in the 1930s.  </tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia is a multi-ethnic society in which each group is worried about its
share of the population.  The influx of Indonesians is believed by some Chinese
to be tolerated by the Malaysian government, which allegedly sees Indonesians
as adding to Malay political power. </tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia is building a RM54.6 million ($22 million) wall 2.5 to 3.5 meters
high on its northern border with Thailand to discourage illegal immigration and
drug smuggling.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC21">Japan
to Train Foreign
Workers</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>The Japanese government plans to extend the maximum length of "training"
for foreign workers from two to three years in order to encourage the
acceptance in the country of foreign workers. </tt><p>
<tt>The current program was last revised in April 1993.  Trainees are on
probation for six months, and then tested for skills.  If they pass the test,
they can continue working at a company for one and a half years. </tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreign trainees was 1,164 in fiscal 1993, and 2,320 in the
first nine months of FY95.  Most trainees are from China.  Most of the workers
are trained at smaller companies such as machinery makers and construction.
</tt><p>
<tt>There are an increased number of meetings to discuss foreign worker issues
in Japan.  Some of the Japanese sponsors advocate at least a limited amnesty
for some illegal workers and the possibility of guest workers becoming
permanent residents.  One government report in 1995 estimated that there were
600,000 foreign workers, including 300,000 illegal workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Japan has announced a goal of having 100,000 foreign students by the year
2000, up from 54,000 in 1994, in order to combat shrinking enrollment due to
population declines.  However, only 3,000 foreigners took the standard entrance
exams required by all public and some private universities in 1995--the low
number is attributed to a crackdown since 1993 on illegal foreign workers in
Japan, the high cost of living, the Hanshin earthquake and the sarin gas
attacks.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC22">Hong
Kong</a>/a></a>
Prepares Residents for 1997</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Some 160,000 Hong Kong residents lined up before the March 31, 1996
deadline to apply for British National Overseas (BNO) passports that give them
more freedom to travel internationally after July 1, 1997.  BNO passports
permit visa-free travel for holders to the UK and 80 other countries, while the
SAR passports to be issued to Hong Kong residents by China currently permit
visa-free travel only to the UK and Singapore.</tt><p>
<tt>About half of Hong Kong's 6.2 million residents are eligible for BNO
passports.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated one million Hong Kong residents hold foreign passports,
raising the issue of how China, which does not permit dual citizenship, will
treat them.  One proposal is to permit those with foreign passports to declare
themselves to be foreigners or Chinese when they enter Hong Kong--if they
declare themselves foreigners, they will enjoy consular protection from their
country of nationality in Hong Kong,  but may lose some of the rights that
Chinese have in Hong Kong.  </tt><p>
<tt>A variation on this proposal is to allow current Hong Kong residents who
declare themselves to be foreigners to nonetheless be able to live and work in
Hong Kong without visas.</tt><p>
<tt>The Hong Kong government is drafting a list of people of ethnic minority
who may be left stateless after the handover.  The list is expected to be
released in the next two weeks.  The list will contain up to about 60,000 names
of those who do not hold three-star permanent Hong Kong identity cards and
whose only travel document is either a British Dependent Territory's Citizen
passport or a British National Overseas passport.  Most of the ethnic
minorities are from India and Pakistan.  </tt><p>
<tt>During a March visit, British Prime Minister John Major promised sanctuary
for ethnic minorities if they came under pressure from China to leave Hong
Kong. </tt><p>
<tt>The Hong Kong government announced new rules for mainland Chinese migrants
to get permanent residency in Hong Kong on April 25.  Effective April 24,
holders of one-way permits will be allowed to stay for seven years on arrival,
and then become eligible for residency.  Previously, migrants from China would
have had to receive four extensions. </tt><p>
<tt>The change will allow 52 immigrations officers to be reassigned, and reduce
government processing fees by $6 million.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC23">Taiwan:
Foreign Workers and Illegal
Immigration</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On April 10, some 550 Chinese illegal immigrants in Taiwan staged a
demonstration at a detention center after being held as long as seven months.
The Chinese were caught in fishing boats before they entered Taiwan; they were
migrating in search of jobs.  They are demanding to be returned to China, but
the Chinese government has refused to take them back. </tt><p>
<tt>Taiwanese government agencies will allow Hong Kong labor brokers to help
find jobs in Taiwan for specialists and technicians from the British colony.
Only legally registered labor agencies in Hong Kong will be allowed to open
Taiwan offices.  The brokers will be prohibited from sending unskilled workers
such as maids to Taiwan. </tt><p>
<tt>Officials of the Council of Labor Affairs and labor representatives reached
an agreement that will prevent Taiwan companies from employing foreign workers
for longer than six or eight years.  The CLA wants to cut down on the country's
reliance on overseas workers, and to allocate the foreign worker quotas to
companies that have the most acute need for foreign workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>The CLA wants to lower the ratio of foreign to native workers, since the
unemployment rate in Taiwan is at a relatively high rate of two percent.
However, agreement could not be reached on a CLA proposal to cut the ratio of
foreign workers to 30 percent of the total work force in the manufacturing
sector from the current level of 35 percent, reducing the ratio for major
public construction projects to 50 percent from 65 percent, and lowering the
ratio for large investment projects exceeding NT$ 200 million to 40 percent
from 50 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan currently has over 210,000 legal foreign workers.  There were about
160,000 foreigners in Taiwan in 1994, including 125,000 blue-collar
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Although the unemployment rate has lead to restrictions on foreign workers
in some areas, they are credited for the success of the Taichung industrial
processing zone.  In 1993, 77 foreign workers were hired, and their number rose
to 528 in 1994.  In 1995, over 900 foreign workers were employed, and there
were still over 400 job vacancies in the zone.  Foreigners account for 10

Remittances Up</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Philippine Central Bank reported that remittances from Filipino
overseas contract workers increased over 63 percent to US $4.93 billion in 1995
(124 billion pesos), up from US $3.01 billion in 1994.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The number of Filipinos going abroad fell from 719,602 in 1994 to
654,022 in 1995.  Filipino workers in Singapore remitted a record or US $106
million in 1995.  Most of the 65,000 Filipinos in Singapore are female domestic
helpers, and they remit an average $1630.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines is the only country with a law that explicitly tries to
protect its nationals employed abroad--the Migrant Workers and Overseas
Filipino Act of 1995.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>Several Filipino politicians have that the country's Overseas
Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) and the Philippine Overseas Employment
Administration (POEA) be merged into a new Cabinet level department to deal
with Filipinos working abroad.  Other proposals include the creation of an
Overseas Filipino Workers bank, with a capital contributions from the
Philippine Social Security System (SSS) and Government Service Insurance System
(GSIS).</tt><p>
<tt>On April 18, a Philippine congressional committee, the Committee on
Overseas Contract Workers, reported in mid-April that Singapore, Malaysia,
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, Qatar and Turkey do not have laws to protect
foreign workers.  There are 500,000 Filipino workers in these seven countries,
employed mostly as maids, and Singapore, Qatar, Turkey and Egypt do not have
laws to protect foreigner maids.  In Malaysia, labor laws apply equally to
foreign and local workers, but the foreign workers must pay levies for the
privilege of working in the country.</tt><p>

involving police--is reportedly threatening some Chinese investment in the
country.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC26">New

Immigrants</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The New Zealand First Party is gaining strength in opinion polls, mostly by
portraying the 125,000 Asian immigrants in the country of 3.5 million as "too
rich" and persons who "sponge" off the local economy by leaving their families
in New Zealand, while they commute to jobs in Taiwan.  Asians are about 60
percent of New Zealand's immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>The First Party, headed by a Maori, calls for a limit of 10,000 immigrants
per year and a four-year probation period for all immigrants during which they
could own a maximum 25 percent of any New Zealand company.  The First Party's
campaign has been blamed for three attacks on Asian immigrant families in the
past few months.</tt><p>
<tt>In response to the increasing anti-immigrant sentiment, a group of mostly
Asians launched a new political party of April 22.  The Ethnic Minority Party
of New Zealand hopes to give a political voice to ethnic minorities.  Asians
account for 3.5 percent of New Zealand's population.  The new party plans to
form a coalition with other small parties to reach the five percent threshold
needed to gain representation in the Parliament. </tt><p>
<tt>Some see the creation of a racially based party as detrimental to race
relations in New Zealand.  </tt><p>
<tt>Australian Immigration Minister Paul Ruddock announced plans in March 1996
to encourage new immigrants to bypass Sydney and Melbourne for South Australia,
Tasmania and the Northern Territory.  Some 80,000 immigrants are expected in
1996, mostly from Hong Kong, China, Vietnam, the Philippines and India.</tt><p>
<tt>Voters in New South Wales and  Queensland re-elected two candidates who
want to eliminate special preference for Aborigines.  Their re-election
reflects a growing sentiment, especially among the poorer whites, that the
Aborigines, who have received protections from the government, are on the
"gravy train."</tt><p>
<tt>The new coalition plans to also review the present immigration policy, with
a proposal to cut welfare to new immigrants who are unemployed. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC27">Foreigners
in the
Gulf</a>/a></a></h2>
<tt>The six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) States--Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates-- are attempting to reduce
their dependence on foreign workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are over seven million foreigners among the GCC's 10 million workers,
and foreigners make up 90 per cent of the work force in the United Arab
Emirates (UAE), 83 per cent in Qatar, 82 per cent in Kuwait, 69 per cent in
Saudi Arabia and around 60 per cent in Bahrain and Oman.  The total GCC
population of 26 million is expected to increase to 39 million by 2010,
including 21 million residents under 21.</tt><p>
<tt>In October 1995, GCC labor ministers adopted a "blueprint on facilitating
the movement of national manpower between member states and the replacement of
foreign labour by national manpower."  However, plans to train local workers,
promote free mobility for GCC nationals within the region, and reduce
dependence on foreign workers, in part by reducing their wages and benefits,
have been slow to develop.</tt><p>
<tt>Saudi Arabia has about 7.5 million workers, including 5.5 million
foreigners (73 percent of the labor force are foreigners).  Oman has 900,000
workers, including 620,000 or 69 percent foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>Kuwait has 718,848 workers, including 605,889 or 84 percent foreigners.
Bahrain has 226,448 workers, including 135,786 or 60 percent foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>Bahrain, an island nation linked by causeway to Saudi Arabia, has a
population of 572,000, divided about equally between Bahrain nationals and
foreigners.  The per capita income was $14,600 per year in 1993.</tt><p>
<tt>Bahrain nationals make up 90 percent of government workers and 30 percent
of private-sector workers.  However, from two to 11 percent of Bahrain
nationals are unemployed.</tt><p>
<tt>The government is attempting to urge Bahrain nationals to accept
lower-level jobs now held by foreigners.  Bahrain nationals now constitute 25
percent of employees in four- and five-star hotels, compared with five percent
in the early 1980s</tt><p>
<tt>Sunni Muslims control the government and most of the island's wealth, and
the Shiite Muslim majority.</tt><p>
<tt>The UAE has 2.4 million people, and 90 percent of its 800,000 workers are
foreigners.  Males outnumber females in the UAE two to one.</tt><p>
<tt>In January 1996, the UAE announced that foreigners could bring spouses,
sons up to 18, and unmarried daughters or sons in school if they earned at
least 3,000 dirhams ($817) each month and were provided with free housing (4000
dirhams without free housing).</tt><p>
<tt>Some 2.6 million people who say they were hurt by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
in August 1990 have filed claims for compensation, asking for $190 billion, and
30 percent of Iraq's revenues from the sale of oil would be diverted to pay
their claims, a projected $1.2 billion per year.</tt><p>

<tt>On March 21, 1996 the US House of Representatives passed a bill 333-87 that
would add agents to the US Border Patrol, take other steps to reduce illegal
immigration to the US, and prevent legal immigrants from receiving welfare
assistance.  On May 2, 1996, the Senate approved a similar bill by a vote of
97-3, making it likely that some type of immigration reform law will be enacted
in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Both Senate and House versions of immigration reform are known as H.R.
2202.</tt><p>
<tt>About 3.2 million illegal aliens were estimated to have been in the US in
October 1992, and their number is believed to be increasing by about 300,000
per year.  Half of the settled unauthorized alien population in the US is
thought to have entered without inspection, and half are persons who entered
lawfully.  Most of the proposals in the new legislation are aimed at persons
who sneak across the borders.</tt><p>
<tt>The Senate conference committee that was assigned the task of reconciling
the separate bills was appointed in May; the House committee is expected to be
appointed in early June.  Congress is expected to vote on the resulting  bill
by summer.  President Clinton will probably sign a bill if it does not include
the House-passed provision that would allow states to deny K-12 education to
illegal alien children.</tt><p>
<tt>The House and Senate bills include three major sets of measures to reduce
illegal immigration and reduces the access of legal immigrants to welfare.
First, both provide for stronger border enforcement, adding 1,000 Border Patrol
agents per year for five years, bringing the total from 5,175 in 1996 to almost
10,000 by 2000.  Both call for a 14-mile "triple fence" on the US-Mexican
border south of San Diego, and would increase the penalties for smuggling
aliens into the US and for using false documents to obtain US jobs or welfare
assistance--document fraud could bring a $500,000 fine and 15 years in prison.
Both bills also permit the Attorney General to allow local police departments
to "seek, apprehend, and detain" illegal aliens who are subject to an order of
deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>Second, both bills introduce pilot programs to enable employers to verify
the status of newly-hired workers.  The Senate bill would give the President up
to eight years to test three verification programs and report the results back
to Congress, while the House measure specifies a three-year voluntary pilot
program for employers in five states -- California, New York, New Jersey,
Florida and Texas.  No national worker eligibility verification system could be
established, however, without another congressional vote.  Both bills narrow
the range of documents that persons seeking US jobs may present to employers as
proof that they are lawful workers from the current 29 to six.</tt><p>
<tt>Third, both bills seek to prevent LEGAL immigrants from obtaining welfare
benefits.  Under current law, immigrants must show that they will not become
"public charges" in the US, and this requirement is usually met by the US-based
sponsors of relatives immigrating.  They sign affidavits assuming financial
responsibility for their relatives.  If the pending legislation becomes law,
these affidavits will become legally binding.  </tt><p>
<tt>If immigrants apply for welfare assistance within 10 years of their arrival
(Senate), or before they become naturalized US citizens (House), the welfare
agency could "deem" or assume that the immigrant has access to his sponsor's
income and assets.  US residents who want to sponsor immigrants would have to
have incomes of at least 125 percent (Senate) or 200 percent (House) of the
poverty line ($14,700 for a family of four in 1993), up from the current
requirement of at least a poverty line income. </tt><p>
<tt>Under the proposed legislation, if the immigrant and sponsor's incomes are
so low that the immigrant nonetheless qualifies for assistance, the immigrant
may become deportable.  Under US law, an immigrant is deportable if she becomes
a "public charge," defined in pending legislation as receiving welfare
assistance for 12 months or more in a five-year period (Senate) or seven-year
period (House).  </tt><p>
<tt>The Senate bill makes illegal aliens eligible for emergency Medicaid,
school lunches and other nutrition programs, immunizations, and short-term
disaster relief, but permits legal immigrants to participate only in school
lunch and nutrition programs.</tt><p>
<tt>The Government Accounting Office in May reported that 25 percent of the
elderly supplemental security income recipients were legal immigrants.  About
two-thirds of the immigrants on SSI live in California, New York and Florida.
SSI was established in 1972 to help people who do not qualify for Social
Security benefits.  In 1996, the maximum SSI payment is $470 a month for an
individual and $705 for a couple.  In 1995, about 6.5 million people received
nearly $25 billion in federal SSI benefits, and $3 billion in state
benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>The House and Senate bills differ in three important areas.  The House
bill, but not the Senate bill, would permit states to deny K-12 education to
unauthorized alien children in the US.  There are believed to be at least
600,000 such children in US schools, half in California.  </tt><p>
<tt>Second, the House bill prohibits illegal alien parents from applying for
welfare benefits on behalf of their US-born and US-citizen children.  The US
citizen children remain eligible, but a legal US resident would have to apply
for benefits on their behalf.  Third, the House bill permits, under certain
circumstances, the immediate expulsion of foreigners who arrive in the US and
apply for asylum; the Senate removed a similar provision on a 51-49 vote.
</tt><p>
<tt>Many advocates are using the pending immigration legislation to preserve or
remove provisions affecting immigrants in anti-terrorism law signed in April
1996.  For example, under the "summary exclusion" procedures included in the
anti-terrorism law, beginning in November 1996, INS officers at ports of entry
will have final authority to exclude from the US aliens arriving without
documents, and those arriving with false documents, who request asylum.  Under
current US law, an alien may request a hearing with an immigration judge before
being removed from the US, and may seek judicial review of a denial of an
asylum application and order of deportation. </tt><p>
<tt>Similarly, the anti-terrorism law eliminates the possibility that legal
immigrants who have been in the US for at least seven years can avoid
deportation if they were convicted of felony crimes in the US.  The immigration
bill relaxes this a bit, saying that the immigrant must be <u>sentenced</u> to
five or more years in prison to be ineligible for 212(c) relief from
deportation.  In FY94, 4,100 legal immigrants asked to stay in the US after
being convicted of crimes, and 1,800 were allowed to stay.  </tt><p>
<tt>The anti-terrorism bill similarly does not permit immigration judges to
suspend deportation for unauthorized aliens who have been in the US seven or
more years if they entered without inspection.  In FY94, 4,300 unauthorized
immigrants asked to stay in the US, and 2,400 were allowed to stay.  The
immigration bill preserves suspension of deportation, renaming it cancellation
of deportation or removal.</tt><p>

<tt><u>Legal Immigration</u>.  The INS was criticized by Congressional leaders
of immigration subcommittees in May 1996 for "misleading" the public about
immigration levels.  Just before a crucial Senate vote March 28 on whether to
reduce legal immigration, the INS released the FY95 immigration numbers, which
showed that 720, 000 immigrants arrived in FY 1995, down 18 percent from
880,000 in FY 1993.</tt><p>
<tt>The agency said that the numbers showed that prudent planning and
management were making immigration levels controllable without new legislation,
and the Senate thereupon defeated an effort to reduce legal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>Internal INS projections became public, however, revealing that the agency
expects immigration levels to rise in 1996 and 1997--some 100,000 to 200,000
visa applications were pending at the end of FY 1995 due to an administrative
logjam.</tt><p>
<tt>Advocates jumped to exploit the new data.  Those who want to reduce
immigration argued that the administration's use of numbers was another example
of the politicization of the immigration issue.  </tt><p>
<tt>Those who favor the status quo, or more immigration, argued that the
long-run level of legal immigration is about 850,000 per year, and that, in any
year, the number "admitted" may rise or fall by 10 to 20 percent as a result in
variations in INS processing, and because of fluctuations in the number of
visas requested by US employers.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 16, 1996, the House Immigration Subcommittee held a hearing on the
numbers issue, during which the INS was criticized by Lamar Smith, chair of the
immigration subcommittee for "misleading Congress" after trends in legal
immigration.  The INS projects about 953,000 immigrants and refugees in FY
1996. </tt><p>
<tt>The INS testified that the wild card in projecting legal immigration to the
US is the behavior of the 2.7 million illegal aliens who were legalized and
became permanent resident aliens under the Immigration Reform and Control
Act--1.6 million as LAWs (unauthorized aliens in the US before 1982 or persons
legalized under Section 245A of the INA), and 1.1 million as SAWs (Section
210).  It is estimated that spouses and minor children of legalized LAWs and
SAWs comprise 80 percent of the 1.1 million people in the second preference
backlog--70 percent are Mexicans.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the INS, most of the 911,000 spouses and minor children on the
second preference waiting list who want to join newly-legalized aliens in the
US are already in the US--101,000 applied for Family Unity protection from
deportation, and many of the rest are in the US illegally.  By one estimate,
about one-fourth of all immigrants "admitted to the US" in any year are already
in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The timing and manner by which this second preference backlog is eliminated
play key roles in identifying the number of immigrants "admitted" to the US.
The backlog could be eliminated if legalized aliens naturalize, and petition
for the admission of their immediate families--LAWs could naturalize after
December 1993, and most SAWs after December 1995 (there is no quota on the
admission of family members of US citizens, and INS data do not differentiate
between US-born and foreign-born US citizens who petition for the entry of
their immediate relatives).</tt><p>
<tt>About 42 percent of the foreign-born residents of the US in the 1990 Census
were naturalized US citizens, and 23 percent of the Mexican-born residents had
become naturalized US citizens by 1990.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS assumed that 45 percent of the newly legalized aliens would
naturalize, a higher percentage than usual for Mexicans because, to become a US
immigrant, the LAWs had to take an English and civics test that is similar to
the naturalization tests.  Among the LAWs, a survey suggested that there would
be one spouse or minor child to be admitted as an immigrant for each three
legalized aliens.  The INS assumes that each of the 1.1 million SAWs would
petition for a spouse or child.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS assumed that all of the family members of LAWs and SAWs are in the
backlog, and that an average 60,000 per year would be admitted to the US under
current laws, so that about 200,000 would remain in the second preference queue
in 2003.</tt><p>
<tt>As of May 10, 1996, at least 308,000 legalized aliens applied for
naturalization, representing 20 percent of the total eligible group.</tt><p>
<tt>A second factor changing immigrant admissions numbers is that, beginning in
the summer of 1995, aliens residing illegally in the United States when they
were eligible to become immigrants could adjust their status while remaining in
this country.  Because of delays in setting up the INS system to process these
immigrants, many of the aliens who applied for adjustment to immigrant status
in 1995 will be admitted as immigrants in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of Mexican-born US residents appears to have increased in the
1990s.  There were 4.3 million Mexican-born residents enumerated in the 1990
Census, 6.3 million in the March 1994 CPS, and 6.7 million in the March 1995
CPS.  However, the CPS reports that significantly more Mexicans arrived in the
1980s than does the Census, i.e, more Mexicans in the US in 1995 than in 1990
reported that they arrived in the 1980s.  This is a surprising result, because
some Mexican-born residents emigrate, and others die.  </tt><p>
<tt>An analysis by Jeff Passel suggests that the Mexican-born population in the
US is rising, but not by the 500,000 per year implied by 1990 Census-1994/95
CPS changes.  It appears that many SAWs were not enumerated in the 1990 Census,
but were in the US with their families in 1994-95, and reported that they
arrived in the US in the 1980s.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Criminal Aliens.</u> Under the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program
(SCAAP), the Department of Justice makes grants to states in accordance with
INS estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in state prisons. </tt><p>
<tt>According to Sen. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich), there are almost 500,000
convicted foreign-born felons in the US.  Aliens are first tried to determine
whether they committed a crime in the US.  If convicted, each is entitled to a
hearing before an immigration judge to determine if he/she is to be deported.
</tt><p>
<tt>Criminal aliens ordered to be deported may appeal to the US Board of
Immigration Appeals (BIA), asking to remain in the US because they e.g., have
families here.  The INS typically releases criminal aliens while they wait for
the outcome of these deportation hearings, since the alien has already been in
prison for the US crime committed, and GAO estimates that most criminal aliens
released commit additional crimes--77 percent of non-citizens convicted of
felonies are re-arrested at least one more time in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>To expedite deportations, the INS began to station agents and hearing
officers in federal and state prisons, so that the alien can ask to prevent
deportation before being released.  The INS has also begun to station agents in
county jails--Anaheim may be the first city in the US to have INS agents
permanently stationed in its jail in order to identify and deport all illegal
immigrants who have been arrested.  According to a survey conducted in Fall
1995, 35 percent of the Anaheim 's inmates were illegal aliens.</tt><p>
<tt>Pending immigration legislation includes government funding for a six-month
pilot program at Anaheim jail. </tt><p>
<tt>According to a report in the Los Angeles Times, of the 2,300 suspected
Mexican drug traffickers taken into custody in border areas in 1995, one in
four were sent back to Mexico because of jail overcrowding and lack of
resources to prosecute them in the US.  US Customs says that, in general,
prosecution is deferred if the smuggler has less than 125 pounds of drugs, or
if the defendant is a Mexican citizen. </tt><p>
<tt>One reason US jails are overcrowded is the large number of foreigners
detained by Operation Gatekeeper.  In the first week of May, 1996, of the 930
inmates housed at the Metropolitan Correction Center in Los Angeles, 49 percent
were charged with immigration law violations and 36 percent were being held for
drug offenses.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS is closing 30 interior Border Patrol offices and shifting the
agents to the border.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS has allocated $5 million to fly 5,000 Mexicans apprehended in the
US to the interior of Mexico in 1996--an average of $1,000 per person for
airfare and transportation from the airport to home communities.  The first 13
Mexicans were flown to Guadalajara in April 1996.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Employer Sanctions</u>.  On May 23, 1996, the INS announced that IBP of
Dakota City, Nebraska; Monfort Inc. of Greeley, Colorado; Excel Corp. of
Wichita, Kansas; and BeefAmerica of Omaha, Nebraska --meatpackers that employ
56,000 workers at 48 sites in ten states and represent about 80 percent of the
industry--agreed to participate in the INS's voluntary Employment Verification
Pilot (EVP) helps employers determine whether their non-citizen employees are
legally authorized to work in the United States.  </tt><p>
<tt>After hiring a new employee, employers participating in EVP send the
A-numbers and other information to an INS database via modem, and the INS
verifies the alien's right to work.  In California, an EVP arrangement with 234
employers who have 80,000 employees in Santa Ana and City of Industry,
including Disneyland, found that about 26 percent of all newly-hired workers
presented false documents to employers.  </tt><p>
<tt>These 234 California employers checked on the status of 11,500 non-US
citizens over seven months, and found that 2,948 were not legally authorized to
work.  In a midwestern meatpacking experiment, 27 percent of the non-US
citizens hired were found to have presented false documents.</tt><p>
<tt>It may be that more than one in four workers presented false documents,
since employers do not check on persons who assert that they are US citizens.
The INS does not seek to apprehend aliens who are denied work, under the theory
that inability to work in the US is enough of a deterrent.</tt><p>
<tt>In Santa Ana, south of Los Angeles, a bakery in the city's enterprise zone
that recruited workers through the city-run Economic Development Department
closed after INS inspections found that 47 of 62 workers were not authorized to
work in the US.  (Enterprise zones are state-designated areas that use tax
incentives to draw jobs to economically depressed districts.)  The city
screened workers to determine if they were economically disadvantaged, but not
for legal status. </tt><p>
<tt>An INS agent in 1995 estimated that almost 25 percent  of the workers in
222 meatpacking plants in Nebraska and Iowa were in the US illegally.  In 1995,
INS agents in Nebraska and Iowa arrested 704 people on illegal immigration
charges, nearly double the 363 arrests the office logged in fiscal 1994.  Some
of those apprehended reported that they paid $400 each to be transported from
the border to Chicago.</tt><p>
<tt>The Excel Corporation, a beef processor in Kansas, agreed to a new contract
affecting about 2,300 hourly workers, mostly Hispanics, that includes a 20 cent
per hour wage increase.  The 13-month contract also includes a stipulation that
if an employee's immigrant status changes and the employee notifies the company
of the change, the employee will not be disciplined for having earlier provided
false information.  </tt><p>

<tt><u>Internal Migration.</u>  California lost a net 143,000 residents to
other states in 1995, reflecting the slowdown in the state's population growth
in the first half of the 1990s.</tt><p>
<tt>During the 1980s, California gained a net 1.25 million residents from the
other 49 states.  Between 1990 and 1995, California lost a net 1.55 million
residents to other states.  California gained a net 1.4 million immigrants in
the first half of the 1990s, or almost 300,000 per year.</tt><p>
<tt>California, which had an estimated population of 31.6 million in 1995, is
expected to have 41 million residents in 2010.  California 's population growth
is fueled by births (over 600,000 per year) and immigration (over 300,000 per
year).</tt><p>
<tt>In reviewing population growth since 1980, demographer Hans Johnson notes
that California's population increased by 500,000 in 1980, a peak 900,000 in
1989, and then 100,000 in 1993.  Johnson's estimates, based on the assumption
that 91 percent of the 18 to 64 year old residents have drivers' licenses,
suggest that there was very high unauthorized immigration to California in the
late 1980s, and a high outmigration of US-born residents to other states.
</tt><p>
<tt>Estimates of illegal immigration based on apprehension data, by contrast,
report declining illegal immigration in the late 1980s.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Welfare.  </u>About 2.7 million of California's 32 million residents
receive cash assistance, including 20 percent of California's children.  About
17 percent of the US welfare recipients live in California but, because
California has a high cost of living, and because California has been
relatively generous, the $6.7 billion spent on cash assistance in California is
27 percent of US welfare spending.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the ongoing debate over how to reform welfare, Democrats stress offering
carrots to induce poor people to work--higher minimum wages, job training and
child care--while Republicans stress penalties for not working--time limits on
the receipt of assistance, lower grants, etc.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Politics.</u>  California politicians, beginning with Governor Pete
Wilson in 1994, link the state's problems to immigration and population trends.
A standard "new Democratic" analysis of the state's problems begins with
California's unique demography.  California is a big and ethnically diverse
state that is seeing its middle class move to other states.  </tt><p>
<tt>As one result, elderly and often wealthy white California voters resist new
taxes, while poor minority residents need more state-provided services than
their taxes pay for, from schools to criminal justice.  California faces the
challenge of building and staffing more schools for the current baby boom
entering K-12.  Prop 98 requires the state to maintain school funding, plus the
prospect of less money but the same responsibility in a federal health and
welfare block grant, while dealing with a growing criminal justice system.  By
some estimates, criminal justice is now California's largest industry.</tt><p>
<tt>Some historically African-American California cities are rapidly becoming
mostly Latino cities, as African Americans move out and Latinos move in.  East
Palo Alto is an example.  Between 1980 to 1990, the African American population
in East Palo Alto dropped from 60 percent to 42 percent, while the Latino
population increased from 14 percent to 36 percent.  Blacks are older-- in
1995, the school district had 29 percent black children, and 58 percent Latino
children.</tt><p>
<tt>California on May 23 announced that women seeking pre-natal care under
Medi-Cal will have to show proof that they are California residents.  The
prenatal care for needy women served 100,000 women in 1995 at a cost of $25
million ($250 each).</tt><p>
<tt>On May 24, a San Diego judge barred the "U.S. Citizens Patrol" from
policing the airport--the patrol was seeking to deter illegal immigrants from
using the airport to travel around the US.  The INS apprehends 20 to 25
unauthorized aliens at the San Diego airport each day.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Labor Markets.</u>  David Heer of USC in November 1994 surveyed
immigrants at day labor markets in southern California, at Mexican soccer
league games, patrons of catering trucks with Spanish menus, and persons in
three shopping centers, and found that 55 percent of the Mexican-born residents
live in areas that have mostly Mexican-born residents.</tt><p>

No Federal Reimbursement</a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On May 13, the US Supreme Court refused to permit Florida to sue the
federal government to recoup the cost of providing services to illegal aliens.
Florida in 1994 sued the US government for $1.5 billion for violating the 10th
amendment to the US constitution, which reserves powers not granted to the
federal government to the states.  Lower courts dismissed Florida's suit,
saying that it raised political rather than legal issues, and the Supreme Court
refused to hear it.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Florida's suit, the federal government's failure to prevent
illegal immigration caused Florida to incur costs to incarcerate illegal alien
criminals, educate children, and provide health care.  The federal district
judge agreed: "The court recognizes that the state of Florida is suffering
under a tremendous financial burden due to the methods in which the federal
government has chosen to enforce the immigration laws.... But recognizing these
facts does not create a legal theory under which this court may grant
relief."</tt><p>
<tt>The dismissal of the Florida suit may revive the two initiative campaigns,
Save Our State and FLA-187, that seek to get voter approval for Prop 187-style
measures in Florida -- 430,000 signatures are needed.  Florida had an estimated
322,000 illegal immigrants, about 10 percent of the national total, in October
1992.</tt><p>
<tt>Five other states -- New York, California, Arizona, Texas and New Jersey --
have had similar lawsuits thrown out by federal judges.</tt><p>

Agree on Migrant Rights</a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt><u>Mexicans' Rights</u>.  On May 8, the US and Mexico signed 11 agreements,
including a four-page "Memorandum of Understanding on Consular Protection" that
spells out the rights of legal and illegal Mexican nationals in the US.  The
MOU largely restates current US law and practice, and emphasizes that the INS
is to notify Mexican consular authorities when they detain pregnant women and
children.</tt><p>
<tt>Another MOU pledges that the US and Mexico will cooperate to crack down on
alien smugglers, and notes with "deep concern" the beatings and accidents
involving unauthorized Mexicans in southern California in April, 1996. There
were almost weekly incidents in southern California in April in which
immigrants trying to flee were injured or killed when the vehicles they were in
crashed.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 9, one of the two unauthorized Mexican aliens clubbed by 1996
Riverside county sheriffs on April 1, 1996 filed two suits seeking compensation
for civil rights violations.</tt><p>
<tt>Southern Californians continued to debate the beatings and accidents of
unauthorized aliens, with many immigration restrictionists arguing that the
deputies were justified in using force to apprehend the aliens.  If the border
were closed, they asserted, there would be no chases and beatings.  </tt><p>
<tt>The two beating victims have been featured at numerous rallies in support
of immigrant rights, prompting even some of those sympathetic to immigrants'
rights to worry about the backlash from a lawsuit filed by lawyers for the
immigrants, arguing that "the felons [the aliens] should not get a windfall
because of the deputies misconduct."  Mexico's aggressive support for
demonstrations and the suit was also criticized. </tt><p>
<tt>Smugglers who bring aliens across the 2,013-mile US-Mexico border for a fee
are raising their rates.  According to Border Patrol agents who interview
aliens after they are apprehended, fees for a guaranteed safe passage to Los
Angeles have risen from a maximum of $200 to $400 or more.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has begun to crack down on smugglers who bring non-Mexicans through
Mexico en route to the US.  In May, Mexican police arrested several smugglers,
and deported the aliens from Central and South America who were being smuggled
to the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>Smuggling people in Mexico is a federal crime punishable by two to 10 years
in jail--judges handed down prison terms to 700 smugglers in 1995, almost
double the 1994 total.  The Mexican Congress is likely to approve in September
a redefinition of smuggling to "organized crime," which would permit 20 years
in jail, and allow police to go after the persons behind the smugglers.</tt><p>
<tt>In Arizona, the U.S. Border Patrol launched a ''Stay Out, Stay Alive'' to
persuade potential illegal aliens not to try to enter the US through the
desert.</tt><p>
<tt>US Secretary of State Christopher led eight cabinet secretaries to Mexico
for the 13th US-Mexico Binational Commission meetings on May 7-8.  The meetings
involved over 300 officials from both countries.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Population.</u>  Mexico's population surpassed 91 million in 1995,
despite a steady decline in the population growth rate, according to a major
mid-decade census report issued April 25, 1996.  Mexico added 10 million people
between 1990 and 1995, but the growth rate slowed to 1.8 percent in 1995 from
two percent in 1990.  According to the Mexican census, the country's population
was 66.8 million in 1980, and 81.2 million in 1990.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico is rapidly urbanizing--some 46 percent of Mexicans lived in cities
of 100,000 or more in 1995, up from 11 percent in 1970.  The percentage of
Mexicans living in towns of less than 2,500 fell from 41 percent in 1970 to 26
percent in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, Mexico City had 8.4 million residents, and the Valley of Mexico
that includes Mexico City had 16.4 million, including Ecatepec on the northern
outskirts with 1.5 million residents, and Nezahualcoyotl to the east with 1.2
million.  Guadalajara had 1.6 million people and a metropolitan area of 3.3
million in 1995, and Monterrey had 1.1 million and an urban area population of
2.9 million.</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexican peso, which has stabilized at about 7.5 pesos to $1 since Fall
1995, is considered to be increasingly overvalued by some analysts, since the
Mexican inflation rate of 30 percent far exceeds the US rate of three percent.
The peso is down 54 percent in nominal terms from its 3.4 pesos to $1 rate of
November 1994, but down only 19 percent in inflation-adjusted terms.</tt><p>
<tt>In mid-May, Mexico reported that exports--fueled by the peso
devaluation--were up 20 percent in the first quarter of 1996 versus 1995.
</tt><p>
<tt>A Mexican peasants organization, the National Union of Autonomous Regional
Campesino Organizations (UNORCA), in April, 1996 said that 80 percent of
Mexico's three million ejidatarios, and 2.5 million small farmers are now
vulnerable to bankruptcy and that NAFTA is to blame.  In late April, 1996, the
Mexican government announced a plan to provide $1 billion in credit and
technical assistance to 600,000 producers of grains on 11.5 million
acres.</tt><p>
<tt>With the opening of a 2,300-employee Samsung television assembly plant in
Tijuana on March 29, 1996, Mexico now has almost as many television
manufacturing workers as the US--25,000 in Mexico versus 30,000 in the US.
Samsung pays the assembly line workers--70 percent women with six or less years
of schooling--345 pesos for a 45-hour work week, or about $47 per week or $1
per hour.</tt><p>
<tt>Over 90 percent of the television sets assembled in Mexico are
exported--NAFTA eliminated tariffs on electronics imports from Mexico and
Canada.  Samsung will open a research &amp; development facility in San
Diego.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has a system of labor courts, and some have argued that, to attract
foreign investment, these courts have become "employer friendly."  For example,
many planned strikes do not result in plant shutdowns--to be legal, a labor
court must certify the strike.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 30, 1996, Presidents Clinton and Zedillo are scheduled to open a
new truck crossing port linking Calexico and Mexicali (pop 750,000).
Mexicali's maquiladoras are booming, a reflection of its stable, non-union
labor force, abundant water supplies from the Colorado River, and proximity to
the U.S. marketplace-- President Zedillo grew up in Mexicali. </tt><p>
<tt>There is apparently more cross-border movement by local residents.  Some
Mexicans legalized under IRCA reportedly are living in the US, but sending
their children to Mexico for schooling, and to get them away from gangs.

<tt>The US Department of Labor on May 3 issued its first-ever report on the
nation's garment workers.  Half of the sewing shops that were investigated had
violated federal labor laws.  There are about 22,000 sewing shops in the
US.</tt><p>
<tt>DOL encourages upstream garment manufacturers and retailers to police their
subcontractors and earn a place on DOL's "No Sweat" list of retailers that
monitor their suppliers.  JC Penny and Talbots were cited as companies that
bought clothing from sewing shops that violated wage and hour laws.</tt><p>
<tt>Some garment manufacturers have contracted with Cal Safety Compliance
Corporation in order to assure themselves that the sewing shops they use are in
compliance with labor laws.  The firm employs 52 inspectors to make quarterly
inspections of the shops.  According to Cal Safety, half of California's 4,000
licensed sewing contractors are not in compliance with labor laws.  In
addition, there are believed to be 1,000 unlicensed sewing shops in southern
California.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 6, 1996, the four Thais who operated the sweatshop in El Monte that

<tt>Immigrants in the US have higher rates of self-employment than US natives.
As immigration increased over the past 25 years, immigrants from particular
countries have become associated with particular businesses in many areas of
the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>For example, immigrants from India and their descendants own almost half of
the economy motels in the US.  US residents of Indian ancestry own over half of
the 620 Econo Lodges, and one-third of the 1,100 Comfort Inns.  Many of the
Indian-Americans who own US lodgings are named Patel, and many moved from the
western Indian state of Gujarati to Africa, and then came to the US via
Africa.</tt><p>
<tt>In New York, 53 immigrants from India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh were the
successful bidders for new taxi medallions, paying up to $180,000 each for the
right to operate a yellow cab in New York City.  </tt><p>
<tt>Other immigrant groups that have found a niche in the US economy include
Koreans who sell fruits and vegetables in major US cities, Palestinians who
operate small stores open for long hours in cities such as Detroit, and
Cambodians who operate doughnut shops in California.</tt><p>
<tt>The economic recovery in southern California is spotlighting the role of
immigrants in business.  According to some observers, southern California is
developing an economy based on small companies run by ethnics who are heavily
involved in international trade.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Koreatown section of Los Angeles, for example, was badly damaged in
1992 riots, but today is home to 500 toy distribution companies with 6,000
employees.  Los Angeles' industrial corridor, stretching 24 miles down Alameda
Boulevard, from downtown Los Angeles to Long Beach Harbor, has thousands of
immigrant-run businesses.  Manufacturing employs 717,000 workers in Los
Angeles, including 120,000 in garments, and many of these businesses are
immigrant-owned and immigrant staffed. </tt><p>
<tt>This industrial corridor is also the place where unions are attempting to
recruit new members.  The Service Employees International Union added 8,000
newly-unionized janitors to its membership in Los Angeles, virtually all of
them Latin American immigrants.  About 1.4 million Hispanics are union members,
making them eight percent of the 17.5 million union workers in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the Hispanic union leaders in southern California got their start
in union organizing with the United Farm Workers union.</tt><p>
<tt>In Orange county, almost one-fourth of all residents were born abroad, and
some analysts believe that immigrant entrepreneurship is spurring an economic
recovery in southern California, since "minority-owned" firms are increasing
their employment at faster than average rates.  There are believed to be
280,000 Latino-owned firms in California in 1996, up from 70,000 in
1982.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the immigrant-owned businesses are small, employing the immigrant
and his family.  A USC study of self-employment among immigrants found that,
over their first 20 years of residence, rates of self-employment jump, from
eight to 21 percent for Asian immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Immigrant Investors.</u> Two US programs that aim to attract immigrant
businesses to the US are reportedly plagued by fraud.  Under one program,
authorized in IMMACT in 1990, up to 10,000 foreigners can be admitted as
immigrants each year if they invest at least $1 million--or $500,000 in rural
areas--and create at least 10 US jobs.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are numerous consultants advertising to would-be investors, but
relatively few takers--only 106 investors committed $1 million or more in FY94,
and 51 committed $500,000 or more (with their dependents, 444 persons were
admitted under the investor criteria).</tt><p>
<tt>One reason why so few foreigners invest in the US in exchange for permanent
immigrant visas is that, once they become US residents, their income earned in
other countries becomes subject to US taxes.</tt><p>
<tt>The other immigrant business program that is not living up to expectations
is the L-1 visa program, which permits foreigners with US business branches to
enter the US temporarily.  Originally designed in the 1970s to permit
multinationals to move key foreign personnel into the US easily, the program
has evolved into a way for small and sometimes fictitious "businesses" to bring
relatives to the US.  There were almost 100,000 L-1 admissions in FY94, up from
about 70,000 in FY91.   Over half of the visas in this category go to the
spouses and dependents of "intra-company" transfers.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 9,500 Turks enumerated in the 1990 Census in New York, mostly in
Sunnyside, Queens and, as economic conditions in Turkey deteriorate, their
number may now top 25,000.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Minimum Wages.</u>  Congress in May 1996 debated whether and how much to
raise the US minimum wage, currently $4.25 per hour, and there were hundreds of
stories about the likely effects of a minimum wage increase on the three to
four million US workers who now earn $4.25 per hour.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 133 million persons 16 and older employed or looking for
work, and about 107 million are employed in the wage and salary jobs covered by
minimum wage laws.  About 12 million US workers--one in nine-- earn less than
$5.15 per hour, and thus would be affected directly by President Clinton's
proposal to increase the minimum wage to $5.15 by 1997.</tt><p>
<tt>The 90-cent increase would push annual pay for a full-time minimum-wage
worker from $8,500 a year to $10,300 and, with the earned income tax credit,
lift a breadwinner with a family of four above the $15,600 poverty line.</tt><p>
<tt>The discussions of whether to raise the minimum wage centered on four
issues.  First, how many jobs are likely to be eliminated at higher wages?
Employers argue that a 20 percent wage hike--$4.25 to $5.15-- would eliminate
about 600,000 jobs, or five percent of the 12 million jobs that pay $5.15 or
less.</tt><p>
<tt>Second, who earns the minimum wage, or, do minimum wage workers "need"
higher wages?  Although many minimum wage workers are teens working in fast
food restaurants, most are adult women employed in a variety of
services.</tt><p>
<tt>Third, how would the effect of higher minimum wage vary across regions and
industries?  For example, between 15 and 20 percent of all workers in states
such as Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas earn less than $5.15 per hour,
versus five to eight percent of workers in the Northeast.</tt><p>
<tt>Fourth, would a higher minimum wage in fact be paid, or would many
employers disregard the law?  The Wall Street Journal on May 20 ran a page one
story that repeated estimates that two to three million US workers are
illegally paid less than the minimum wage.  The story noted that the penalty
for violating the minimum wage is to pay it--apparently not a strong sanction
for often cash-strapped businesses.</tt><p>
<tt>DOL found that 43 percent of 76 garment makers in southern California in
May 1996 were violating minimum wage laws.  Over the past five years, DOL has
normally assessed US employers about $20 million annually for violating minimum
wage laws--the frequency of minimum wage violations per 1,000 workers is
highest in southern states such as Florida, Georgia, Arkansas, and Texas.  Many
restaurants do not pay their employees who receive tips the one-half the
minimum wage (currently $2.13 per hour) as required. </tt><p>
<tt>Some economists argue that, instead of increasing the hourly minimum wage,
the Earned Income Tax Credit should be expanded.  The EITC paid $21 billion to
low earners in 1995--poor people with earnings report their earnings on their
tax forms, and the government mails them a check for up to 40 percent of their
earnings--e.g, family with two or more children and earnings of up to $8,890
could receive up to $3,556 in EITC payments in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Immigrant Mobility</u>.  The Wall Street Journal on April 26, 1996
discussed the Chiswick-Borjas debate over the economic progress of immigrants.
The writer noted that the first wave of immigrants after 1965 included a high
percentage of skilled Asians, so that, when Chiswick tracked their economic
mobility in the late 1970s and early 1980s, he found that they catch up in
earnings to similarly-educated US-born residents within 10 to 15 years.</tt><p>
<tt>However, subsequent immigrants, especially the relatives of Mexican
immigrants, had less education and motivation, what Borjas called "declining
quality," leading Borjas to predict that these immigrants would never catch up
to similar US-born residents in earnings.  Furthermore, Borjas argues that many
immigrants lack the "ethnic capital" needed to catch up economically to similar
US-born residents.  Hispanic immigrant networks, according to Borjas, are more
likely to lead them into the welfare system than into self-employment.</tt><p>
<tt>Borjas estimates that US-born workers lose $133 billion per year in lower
wages because of competition from immigrant workers, and that one-third of the
widening wage gap between high school drop outs and more educated workers is
due to immigrants.  </tt><p>

1997, the Year Against
Racism</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>The EU Parliament has designated 1997 as European Year against Racism, and
called for the "isolation" of "racist parties" such as France's National Front
and the Austrian Freedom Party.</tt><p>
<tt>A report presented to the European Parliament by Dutch Christian Democrat
Arie Oostlander blamed "racist parties" for increasing xenophobia, racism and
anti-Semitism in Europe.  MEPs supported the report's call for a general ban on
discrimination.  The EP also agree that member states should make
naturalization and dual nationality and voting easier for immigrants, but it
stopped short of agreeing that member states should introduce measures
outlawing and punishing organizations engaging in racist and xenophobic
activities.  The report was adopted on May 9. </tt><p>
<tt>On May 8, Belgian officials detained Austria's Joerg Haider, one of the
targets of the EU's battle against xenophobia, for four hours because officials
believed he was trying to enter the country illegally.  Belgian immigration
officials held him in a room packed with illegal African immigrants until a
copy of his passport was faxed to the authorities.</tt><p>
<tt>Generous health and related benefits are being debated or cut in Europe to
increase the flexibility of the labor market and, hopefully, lead to more
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Some expect business to boom for employment services companies as Europe
deregulates labor markets--these companies provide temporary and permanent
employees to firms and become the "employers of record."  In the UK in 1993,
temporary help was 2.7 percent of total employment, 1.7 percent in the
Netherlands, and 1.1 percent in France--versus 1.4 percent in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>In May, the second and third largest employment services companies--Ecco of
France and Adia of Switzerland--agreed to merge, so that the combined company,
as well as Manpower, will each account for about 10 percent of the $77 billion
employment services market world-wide each year.</tt><p>
<tt>In April, France announced cuts in its health care programs, expected to be
approved by Parliament in Summer, 1996, and Germany announced plans to reduce
its budget deficit by $33 billion by reducing work and welfare
assistance.</tt><p>
<tt>Under a 1971 law, Italy guarantees pregnant women full pay during the last
two months of pregnancy and the first three months following the birth-- five
months at full pay, with 80 percent of the tab paid by the government.  In
1995, the Italian government paid $900 million in maternity benefits.  In
response, some Italian employers avoid hiring young women, or hire them in
part-time, contractual jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>There are few public or private child care facilities for children aged
0-3, but 90 percent of the children aged three to six are in "scuola materna,"
the state-supported kindergartens.</tt><p>
<tt>Italy has one of the lowest fertility rates in Europe--at current rates,
the average woman will have 1.2 births in her lifetime, versus two in the
US.</tt><p>

Court Upholds Asylum
Reforms</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt><u>Asylum/Aussiedler.</u>  The German Constitutional Court on May 14 upheld
the asylum reforms that went into effect on July 1, 1993--the reforms sharply
reduced the number of applicants for asylum in Germany.  The German court
emphasized that the reforms did not change an individual's right to asylum in
Germany if she faces political persecution at home.</tt><p>
<tt>The court upheld the three key reforms--safe countries of transit, safe
countries of origin, and detention for airport arrivals.  Under the reform,
applicants must apply for asylum in the first safe country that they enter--
Germany is surrounded by safe countries.  Second, the reforms define safe
countries of origin, to which applicants can be returned while their
applications are considered.  Third, applicants who fly to Germany can be
detained if they apply upon entry, or they must apply within three days after
their arrival--the court extended this period to apply to seven days in its
234-page ruling.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreigners seeking asylum in Germany was 9,500 in April,
1996, bringing the total to 40,000 for the first four months of 1996, including
7,900 Turks, 7,400 from Serbia and Montenegro, 3,200 from Iraq, and 2,000 from
Afghanistan.  In 1995, there were 127,937 applications for asylum, 127,210 in
1994, 322,599 in 1993, and 438,191 in 1992.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, about nine percent of the asylum seekers were granted asylum in
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>During the first four months of 1996, some 54,200 ethnic Germans arrived in
Germany from the ex-USSR.  There were 218,000 Aussiedler arriving in Germany in
1995, and 222,600 in 1994.  About two million ethnic Germans have emigrated
from the former East Bloc to Germany since the 1989 opening of the Berlin Wall,
and four million still live in eastern Europe.</tt><p>
<tt>The German government denied a May 27 story in Der Spiegel that it was
considering limiting the influx of Jewish refugees from the former Soviet Union
because most of them were no longer persecuted, and are now economic refugees.
In 1990, Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed to accept for humanitarian reasons an
unlimited number of Jews from the former USSR.  More than 45,000 Jews and their
relatives have migrated to Germany.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Bosnians.</u>  Some 200,000 of the 320,000 Bosnians living in Germany
are scheduled to return to Bosnia in the six months beginning  July 1, 1996--an
estimated 70 percent of them were ethnically cleansed from areas now under
Serbian control, so that they will have to return to areas controlled by the
Muslim-Croat federation.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some local Bosnian leaders in government-controlled parts of Bosnia -
almost all under the control of President Alija Izetbegovic's ruling Muslim
Democratic Action Party - are demanding that each person returning from Germany
bring "taxes" of up to DM10,000 (US $6,600) each.  A German assessment of
prospects for the return of Bosnians, and for peace in Bosnia, was very
pessimistic--the 16 Laender interior ministers on May 3 agreed that before
Bosnians can be returned, local safety must be guaranteed.</tt><p>
<tt>The UNHCR agrees.  On May 12, a UNHCR official said that most of the two
million Bosnians displaced by the war--including the one million elsewhere in
Bosnia--will not be able to return to their original homes because they will be
"unwanted strangers" in their old homes.</tt><p>
<tt>There are also believed to be 120,000 Kosovo Albanians in Germany-- mostly
failed asylum-seekers.  On May 16, the Serbian government agreed to take them
back into the reconstituted Republic of Yugoslavia--Serbia and Montenegro.
Germany said it will not pay Yugoslavia to expedite the Kosovo Albanians
return.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Labor Market</u>. The German government, seeking to make the labor
market more flexible, is permitting small employers to dismiss
workers--henceforth, employers with less than ten employees, up from the
current less than five, will be freer to dismiss workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The president of the "Bundesanstalt fuer Arbeit" or federal labor office on
May 1 said that Germans must accept the fact that labor market flexibility is
the key to creating jobs.  According to Jagoda, Germany would have two million
more jobs if the number of part-time jobs could be increased.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Turks/Vietnamese.</u>  Integration indicators for second-generation
Turks are mixed.  On the one hand, there are about 16,000 Turks studying in
German universities.  On the other hand, 86 percent of the foreign youth under
20 who are jobless have not learned an occupation.  Over 80 percent of Turkish
children in Germany have worker parents.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Turks advocate coordinated Turkish and German government efforts to
integrate Turks in Germany.  Turkey's Prime Minister Yilmaz visited Germany in
May, seeking German help to unfreeze EU subsidies for Turkey that have so far
been blocked by Greece, and asking Germany to protect and better integrate
Turks living in Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>Yilmaz warned the German government that most Kurds seeking asylum in
Germany are "working undercover" for the outlawed PKK.  There are about 500,000
Turkish Kurds in Germany, out of a total Turkish population in Germany of 2.2
million. </tt><p>
<tt>Since 1992, 35 Vietnamese have been killed in Berlin, usually in fighting
with other Vietnamese gangs over the sale of non-taxed cigarettes.  Gang
leaders tend to operate from Czech or Polish border villages rather than from
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 60,000 Vietnamese living legally in Germany, and another
40,000 more are thought to be illegally present--cigarette vendors are drawn
from the illegals ranks.  Vietnam agreed to accept many of the former East
German guest workers who were Vietnamese in exchange for $65 million in
assistance, but took only 67 Vietnamese in 1995, far less than the 2,500 in the
agreement.</tt><p>
<tt>Last year's clampdown on right-wing violence by the German government
resulted in a 44 percent drop in violent crime by neo-Nazis and right-wing
extremists, according to the Federal Office for the Protection of the
Constitution's annual report.  The report indicated that violent crimes with a
racist or right-wing motive fell from 1,489 in 1994 to 837 in 1995, the lowest
level since 1990.  Contributing to the drop in racist crimes is the tightening
of Germany's asylum laws, which halted much of the support for the extreme
right-wing political parties.  </tt><p>

<tt>Interior Minister Debre endorsed some of the 46 recommendations made by a
parliamentary commission April 16, 1996, arguing that "if we want to integrate
the legal foreigners in this country, we have to be intransigent with those who
are illegal."  Among the recommendations were to permit police to hold illegal
aliens for up to 45 days, versus the current 10 days, and to create files on
persons with whom new immigrants live in France.</tt><p>
<tt>The parliamentary commission's report created a furor by calling for an end
to automatic immigrant access to education and medical care, and for permitting
foreigners under 18 to be deported.</tt><p>
<tt>Another Parliamentary report released in May estimated that France is
losing $20 billion to $32 billion annually because of undeclared work by
illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Polls suggest that 33 percent of the French want tougher laws against
illegal immigration, while 49 percent believe that better enforcement of
current laws will suffice.  Some expect France's political parties to compete
with one another to "get tough" on immigration to offset the appeal of the
National Front in elections in 1998.</tt><p>
<tt>In order to counter the National Front's "get tough" attitude on
immigration, the French Interior Minister has ordered the expulsions of several
planeloads of illegal immigrants.  Debre argues that tightening immigration
controls is the only way to stem the rise of the ultra-right wing.</tt><p>
<tt>The National Front accused the French government on May 20 of suppressing
official reports that show links between immigration and crime.  According to
the reports, which could not be verified by the government, there were 200
stone-throwing attacks on buses in 1995, and over 100 bus drivers had been
assaulted and more than 600 cars set on fire in Lyon. </tt><p>
<tt>In a May 25 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Jean Marie Le Pen
explained that the "growth in immigration...provoked unbearable economic and
social consequences... the idea of the 'nation' remains the most effective way
to protect security, liberty, identity and prosperity...One cannot make French
people from massive immigration.  To live in security and harmony, people need
a certain homogeneity."</tt><p>
<tt>Le Pen recommended that one solution to US immigration problems would be to
invest in Mexico, so that Mexicans can achieve "their aspirations inside their
own borders."  Mexicans, according to Le Pen, are easier to integrate in the US
than are Islamic immigrants in France, since Mexicans share many aspects of US
culture and Christianity.</tt><p>
<tt>Film star Brigette Bardot attacked Muslims for slaughtering sheep to
celebrate religious holidays.  Bardot, though married to a local leader of Le
Pen's National Front party, supports the Chirac government.  Bardot complained
that while churches sit empty because of a lack of priests, mosques are being
built throughout France.  According to Bardot, France has been invaded by
foreigners, with the blessing of the government.</tt><p>

<tt>As the Asylum and Immigration Bill made its way through the British
Parliament, a Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme was added to permit British
farmers to employ, from May through November, up to 10,000 Eastern Europeans as
farm workers.  The bill will introduce employer sanctions, and some farmers
feared that they would not be able to recruit enough short-term casual labor to
harvest crops.</tt><p>
<tt>Since World War II, foreign students have been able to work temporarily on
British farms.  Foreign students are paid the same as UK workers at wage levels
set by the Agricultural Wages Board.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 9, the British government defeated an opposition move to eliminate
restrictions included in the Asylum and Immigration Bill on council housing for
asylum seekers and certain categories of immigrants.  The government was also
able to defeat an cross-party move to maintain child benefits for
asylum-seekers who were being denied other social security benefits.  A May 2
amendment to the bill giving police and immigration officers the power to stop
and search people they suspected of being illegal immigrants was also defeated.
</tt><p>
<tt>The number of people applying for asylum in the UK rose by 11,000, to
44,000, in 1995.  Most applicants are from Nigeria, Somalia, India, Pakistan
and Sri Lanka.  </tt><p>
<tt>The government says that since January 1996, when new rules to cut benefits
to "bogus" asylum seekers went into effect, the number of asylum seekers
declined from 11,563 the previous quarter to 8,069.  Figures for April showed
asylum applications dropped from an average monthly number of 3,690 to 2,068.
Only 1,308 of the claims were lodged by people already living in the country--
the lowest number since February 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Britain in April decided not to deport a Saudi dissident to placate Saudi
Arabia, reversing a January 1996 decision to send him to the Caribbean island
of Dominica after a court ruled that the UK had not shown that Dominica was a
safe haven for the dissident.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Saudi dissident was "given leave to remain" in the UK with his family
for four years.  This status permits him to leave and re-enter the UK.</tt><p>
<tt>The Saudi government has assured British officials that they will not
retaliate against British firms because of the dissident's activities. </tt><p>
<tt>Saudi Arabia had warned Britain that it was putting at risk trade links
worth billions of dollars a year by allowing a Saudi dissident to remain in
London. Mohammed al-Masari has published reports accusing the Saudi royal
family of corruption and human rights abuses.</tt><p>

<tt>Since the USSR was formally dissolved in 1991, some nine million people
have been uprooted, including at least two million people who fled regional
conflicts like those in Tajikistan and Georgia.  In May 1996, there was a
conference organized by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the
International Organization for Migration and the human rights division of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</tt><p>
<tt>There are believed to be about six million migrants in the CIS states,
according to the IOM, including 2.5 million refugees and displaced persons.
Some predict that another two to four million ethnic Russians will move to
Russia within the next five years.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 2.7 million of the Russians outside Russia reportedly moved to Russia
over the past three years.  According to the Institute of Economic Forecasts of
the Russian Academy this has compensated for the natural decrease in the
Russian population.  Over the past 10 years Russia's death rate has been about
one million per year with a much smaller number of births.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Ukrainian government has challenged the argument that the break-up of
the USSR left 25 million Russians outside Russia.  The 25 million figure, which
comes from the 1989 Census of the USSR, included 11 million ethnic Russians in
Ukraine.  However, the Ukrainian government argues that many of the ethnic
Russians in Ukraine are "Ukrainians who speak Russian." </tt><p>
<tt>The IOM has signed a migration agreement with the Ukrainian government to
provide technical cooperation, information and assist with the return of
migrants.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Ukraine has received over 300,000 illegal migrants since the collapse
of the Soviet Union.   </tt><p>
<tt>Russia's Federal Border Service reports that they have deported about 367
Chinese from the Maritime Territory since the beginning of the year.  The
Chinese normally enter the country with tourist visas then do no return home.
</tt><p>
<tt>Russia in April announced that food imports would be restricted after July
1, 1996--about 45 percent of Russia's food is imported.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 6,000 Russian companies have received permission to employ
foreigners.</tt><p>

<tt>The Asean Trade Union Council (ATUC) in mid-May announced at an
International Labour Organisation-ATUC symposium that it would urge governments
and employers to phase out migrant workers and replace them with local
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The ATUC urged that the recruitment of migrant workers be done on a
government-to-government basis, or by reputable employment agencies duly
registered with the government.</tt><p>
<tt>On March 1 and 2, the leaders of Asia and Europe held the Asia-Europe
Meeting (ASEM) summit in Bangkok to discuss common issues.  The EU would like
to discuss human rights, while the Asian countries would like to concentrate on
economic cooperation and technology transfers.</tt><p>
<tt>Thai activists pushed the summit members to adopt the UN convention of
rights of migrant workers and family members and minimum standards for the
treatment of  smuggled aliens. </tt><p>
<tt>Most Asian governments have not signed the 1990 United Nations convention
on the rights of migrant workers and their family members, nor taken steps to
fulfill the 1995 Beijing platform for action to against human trafficking
networks.  In many cases, children are trafficked--there are an estimated one
million child prostitutes in Asia.</tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong and the Philippines urged 500 delegates participating in an
agenda-setting meeting for the 18-nation APEC annual summit to include
provisions that would make labor migration easier.  One participant said that
an APEC labor migration agreement may be signed at the 1998 annual
meeting.</tt><p>
<tt>The November, 1996  meeting is scheduled to be held in the
Philippines.</tt><p>
<tt>The UN Commission on Human Rights asked for better protection of women
migrant workers.  The resolution, adopted in April, 1996, calls on countries to
implement legislation to prevent violence against women and to prosecute
offenders.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Global Alliance against Trafficking in Women urged governments to adopt
a set of "standard minimum rules" to protect the rights of women laborers and
those forced into prostitution.  According to the Alliance, female victims are
often prosecuted, and traffickers are often prosecuted under immigration rather
than tougher criminal laws.</tt><p>
<tt>The International Labour Office has taken a special interest in 1996-97 in
women workers, including migrants working outside their country of origin, and
women employed in foreign-owned firms that receive special incentives to invest
in their country of nationality.</tt><p>
<tt>The ILO estimates that some 800,000 Asian women leave their countries of
origin for jobs abroad each year.  An ILO report blames unscrupulous labor
brokers and weak laws for permitting the emigration of Asian women to reach
such high levels.  However, instead of recommending more regulation of women
migrants, the ILO recommends that women be provided with more information
rather than regulation.</tt><p>
<tt>The ILO is also launching a major study of export processing zones, the 230
areas in 70 countries in which special rules apply to foreign firms that
establish factories.  So-called maquiladoras employ almost 40 million local
workers worldwide to assemble goods, usually for re-export.  Most of the
world's export processing zones are in Asia--there are at least three million
workers employed in 64 zones in Asia, plus 14 to 40 million more workers in
Chinese special economic zones.</tt><p>

Two Million Illegals</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>?
</a></h2>
<tt>Thailand's security forces estimate that there may be over two million
unauthorized foreign workers in the country, four times the mid-1995 estimate
of 590,000.  The official government estimate is 500,000 illegal immigrants, of
whom 300,000 are from Burma.  The rest are from Cambodia, Laos, and China.
Most are employed in fishing, farming, construction and the textile and
footwear industries.</tt><p>
<tt>The Thai Immigration Bureau arrested 219,455 illegal immigrants between
1990 and June, 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Thailand has a work force of 35 million, and 10 percent belong to unions.
The unions complain that illegal aliens depress wages--the Thai minimum wage
which is 135 to 145 baht (about four dollars) a day.  On the island of Phuket,
illegal but skilled Burmese workers reportedly work for 70 and 150 baht per
day.  Thai employers can be fined 60,000 baht for each illegal worker they
hire.</tt><p>
<tt>Thailand is considering permitting Burmese workers to be employed legally
in border provinces if employers pay insurance fees of 5,000 baht per
worker.</tt><p>
<tt>Dr. Kritaya Archavanitkul, of the Population and Social Research Institute
at Mahidol University, reported in "Policy Options for the Importation of
Foreign Labour into Thailand" that it is very difficult to make sustainable
foreign worker policies because reliable data on the extent of labor shortages
and the number of foreign workers are inadequate.</tt><p>
<tt>Thai officials report an increase in foreign beggars, who are attracted to
the country because of the tradition of Buddhists giving alms to the poor.
Many come from the neighboring countries of Cambodia and Burma.  Most beggars
earn $4-12 per day. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC19">Singapore</a></a></a></a></a>:
Reduce Dependence</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Singapore's Labor Minister warned the construction industry to improve its
productivity rather than rely on foreign workers.  According to Construction
Industry Development Board figures, more than 85 per cent of the tradesmen and
general labour in Singapore's construction industry are foreign workers, and 90
percent of the foreign construction workers are unskilled.  Despite a levy of
S$440 per month for each unskilled foreign worker, and S$200 for every skilled
worker, the number of foreign workers is increasing.</tt><p>
<tt>The levy helps to prop up the wages of local workers who compete with
foreigners, and allows the Singaporean government to extract some of the wage
gap that motivates migration.</tt><p>
<tt>Singapore phased in a tough new strict liability standard in construction,
making general contractors liable for the labor law violations of
subcontractors.  The revised Employment of Foreign Workers Act went into effect
on March 1, 1996, and three general contractors are being assessed fines for
the 100 illegal foreign workers brought to their work sites by
sub-contractors.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 15, the labour ministry said it would seek prison terms for
contractors who hire illegal workers, even for a first offense--two contractors
were jailed for eight months and 10 months on first offenses.  Since 1995,
there have been 361 employers fined, including one firm that paid S$312,000 for
hiring 26 illegal workers, or $12,000 per worker.</tt><p>
<tt>In January, 1995, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew said that Singapore had
50,000 foreign supervisors, managers and professionals, and another 300,000
blue-collar foreign workers.  Some 9,000 to 10,000 illegal foreigners are found
in Singapore each year.</tt><p>
<tt>Some researchers argue that industries that have high proportions of
foreign workers, such as manufacturing and construction, are less likely to
take steps in their personnel policies to accommodate local workers.  For
example, retailing, which is not allowed to employ foreign workers, offers many
part time jobs.  Singapore's labor ministry says that there are potentially
620,000 housewives and retirees who could work in Singapore. </tt><p>

<tt>Hong Kong and other places in southeast Asia that house the 33,000
Vietnamese "boat people" remaining in camps stepped up their efforts to return
them before UNHCR funds end on June 30, 1996.  The largest group of Vietnamese
is in Hong Kong--some 18,000 remain in camps and, on May 10, several hundred
Vietnamese escaped after rioting for two days to protest their return to
Vietnam.  The rioters burned 17 buildings, including the building housing their
records, in the hopes of slowing their repatriation.</tt><p>
<tt>The US sought to encourage returns by promising to give Vietnamese in the
camps before October 1, 1995 one more chance to apply for asylum in the US
after their return to Vietnam--some 2,000 to 6,000 more Vietnamese might come
to the US under this plan.  Each returning Vietnamese receives $240 from the
UNHCR.</tt><p>

Restricts Foreign Workers</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On May 1, 1996, China introduced new restrictions on foreigners working in
the country, and on internal migrants, in a bid to preserve "social order."
The Regulations on the Management of Foreign People's Employment in China say
that only foreigners with "special skills" will be permitted to work in China,
and they must obtain licenses by June 30, 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Under a 1993 regulation, foreign job-seekers were obliged to register with
the State Bureau of Foreign Experts (SBFE) and apply to "Chinese intermediary
organizations" before looking for work in China.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 180,000 foreigners are currently employed in China, according
to the official Xinhua news agency, and 12 million Chinese are employed by
foreign joint venture companies.</tt><p>
<tt>State enterprises have an estimated 40 million redundant employees, and
there are a further 124 million "surplus" farm workers, plus 80 million migrant
workers.  China abandoned "employment for life" in 1986.</tt><p>
<tt>China's household registration system, established in 1958 to regulate
rural-urban migration, assigns persons at birth to agriculture or urban
residences, and, until recently, this distinction governed access to housing,
employment, and government services.  There are three major types of internal
migration within China--de jure permanent (officially acknowledged changes in
household registration), de facto permanent, and temporary--both are moves that
do not result in changes in household registration.</tt><p>
<tt>Schools in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin began in
March to offer education to the children of migrant workers.</tt><p>
<tt>One analysis of migration patterns within China confirmed the "migration
hump" hypothesis, i.e., that increased development temporarily INCREASES
emigration.</tt><p>

 Detained Foreigners Can Work in Ag</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Malaysian government in mid-May announced that the 11,000 illegal
workers being detained could obtain an "amnesty" or legal work permit if they
agreed to work in agriculture.  There are believed to be up to 100,000 illegal
workers employed on plantations in peninsular Malaysia.  Plantation employers
may request detained foreign workers from Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and
Thailand through July 31, 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The government initiated the program to reduce the amount of money spent on
detention centers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia's Manpower Department opposed the scheme, arguing that offering
amnesty to illegal foreign workers in detention camps will encourage more
illegal immigration, and not encourage labor-saving mechanization in
agriculture.  Unions agreed.</tt><p>
<tt>The Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers' Malaysian Electrical and
Electronics Industry Group (FMM-MEEIG) asked the government to relax rules on
importing foreign workers, so that the industry can restructure and reduce its
dependence on foreign labor.   Under current procedures, a Foreign Workers Task
Force handles each employer request for foreign workers, and the manufacturing
sector is only allowed to recruit foreign workers from Bangladesh, Indonesia,
Pakistan and Thailand.</tt><p>
<tt>Many foreign investors want the levy on each foreign worker--doubled on
January 1, 1996; M$ 200-M$ 400 per month for professional and management
categories and M$70 to M$ 150 for manufacturing and construction--to be waived
for new investments in Malaysia.</tt><p>
<tt>A wildcat strike by foreign workers at the Kuala Lumpur International
Airport under construction brought a reminder that foreign workers can be
deported for striking.  According to the Labor Minister, "Going on strike is
not the Malaysian way of resolving industrial issues."  There were in May 1996
some 17,173 workers, including 7,623 foreigners from 49 countries, employed by
39 contractor at the KLIA site.  The largest groups of foreigners are from
Indonesia (4,407), followed by Bangladeshis (1,074), and workers from Myanmar
(391).</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government announced that, beginning January 1, 1997, foreign
workers would no longer be permitted to be employed to pump gas.  In response,
several gas station chains announced that they would phase in machines that
permit drivers to swipe their credit card and get gas by self service.</tt><p>
<tt>The Seventh Malaysia Plan will attempt to attract women and retirees to
join the labor force in addition to phasing out labor-intensive industries.
Over the next five years the government plans to restrict the importation of
foreign labor to agriculture, construction and domestic services.  </tt><p>
<tt>The government predicts that by the end of the Seventh Malaysia Plan there
will be 781,000 legal foreign workers in the country.   </tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government has established a special task force to tackle the
issue of land encroachment by foreign settlers.  The first meeting, which had
20 representatives from different government agencies was held on May 22, 1996.

</a></h2>
<tt>The Hong Kong government announced on May 18 that it will eliminated the
age restriction on children entering Hong Kong on one-way permits from China
after July 1, 1996.  This means that thousands of mainland children will be
allowed to join their Hong Kong families.  Under current procedures, only
children outside the school-age range - under five or between 16 and 20 - are
eligible to migrate to Hong Kong.  Despite eliminating the age restrictions,
the director of education says there will still be enough room in HK
schools.</tt><p>
<tt>The Hong Kong government increased the daily immigrant quota from 105 to
150 people in July 1995.  Of the 45 additional places, 30 were given to
mainland children who will have right of abode in Hong Kong after the Chinese
take over in 1997.  The remaining slots went to persons separated from their
spouses for 10 years or more.  </tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong's legislative council narrowly passed a bill that allows the
government to detain boat people not formally rejected for repatriation by the
Hanoi government.  The law was enacted to counter a recent ruling by the Privy
Council which deemed it illegal to detain anyone whom Hanoi was not willing to
accept back.  The ruling resulted in the release of hundreds of asylum-seekers
from camps in Hong Kong, mostly ethnic Chinese who are not considered
Vietnamese by Vietnam.  </tt><p>
<tt>The passage of the law was criticized by the Human Rights Watch/Asia.

<tt>The Council of Labor Affairs announced on May 22 that there were 212,800

their wages, driving them down from NT$2,500 ($93) per day in construction to
NT$400 to NT$800 a day.</tt><p>
<tt>The Council of Labor Affairs in May 1996 for the first time allowed a
Filipina maid to stay in Taiwan and change her employer after proving that she

<tt>Christmas Island, a remote island 1,240 miles off Australia's north west
coast, has been the target of the largest influx of Asian boat people in over a
year.  Over 250 people in four boats, most from southern China, landed on the
island the second week of May.  Australian immigration officials say it is too
early to tell if another wave of asylum-seekers is on its way.  </tt><p>
<tt>The last major wave of boat people was in late 1994 and early 1995, when
over 800 Vietnamese born ethnic Chinese landed on Australia's northern shores.
Most were Vietnamese-born ethnic Chinese who said they had been discriminated
against by Chinese authorities.</tt><p>
<tt>Despite a pledge not to reduce immigration, the newly-elected conservative
government is apparently planning to reduce the number of refugees accepted by
Australia from 15,000 to 10,000 per year, thereby saving about $12 million per
year.</tt><p>
<tt>Australia in 1993 permitted 29,000 Chinese to remain after the June 4, 1989
Beijing crackdown and, as their family members join them, China has become the
third leading country of immigration to Australia, after Britain and New
Zealand.  The 19,500 Chinese students and their 9,500 spouses and children were
granted permanent residence in November 1993.</tt><p>
<tt>The Australian Immigration Minister proposed an immigration plan in May
1996 that would award extra points to immigrants who promise to live outside
Sydney and Melbourne for at least two years after their arrival.  Under the
current system, an extra five points are awarded to applicants in the family
category, such as siblings, non-dependent children and some parents, sponsored
by people living in regional areas--the number of points may be raised to 20,
or 20 percent of the 100 needed for admission.</tt><p>

<tt>The Knesset State Control Committee released a report in May 1996 that
asserted that 10 percent of Israel's workers are foreigners--100,000 working
legally, and 100,000 illegal workers, including an estimated 10,000 illegal
Poles.</tt><p>
<tt>Many politicians are echoing former Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek, who
asserted in April that Israel may be creating a "guest worker" problem of
German proportions by importing 80,000 mostly Thai and Romanian workers.  Other
politicians call the foreign worker issue a "time bomb"that "threatens the
country."</tt><p>
<tt>Kollek argued that Israel rely on its own and Palestinian workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Until February 24, 1996, the first suicide bombing, some 80,000
Palestinians were employed legally within Israel's borders, and another 40,000
to 50,000 worked illegally as day laborers in Israel.  Today, the number has
been reduced to about 15,000 daily commuters--including 7,000 Palestinian
workers over the age of 40.  The PLA estimates that 60 percent of Palestinians
are jobless, and that border closures cost $6 million in losses each
day.</tt><p>
<tt>In May 1996, Israel authorized the entry of another 10,000 foreign workers
from Bulgaria and Romania to take the place of Palestinians who are barred from
Israel.</tt><p>
<tt>In the hotly contested election on May 29, 1996, it was revealed that
500,000 Israelis live outside Israel, usually in the US.</tt><p>

<tt>Several ships filled with Liberians fleeing fighting were initially turned
away from neighboring country ports by countries that feared the Liberians
would not leave.  </tt><p>
<tt>In mid-May, about 2,000 Liberians who paid $75 each to flee fighting in
their country on a Ghana-bound Nigerian freighter on May 5 were pushed out to
sea after their ship was partially fixed in the Abidjan, Ivory Coast.  There
are already about 350,000 Liberians in the Ivory Coast as a result of the
six-year civil war.  The UNHCR estimates that more than 750,000 people have
left Liberia in since the fighting started in 1989. </tt><p>
<tt>Ghana later allowed the Bulk Challenge ship to land after passengers
reportedly rioted, and aid agencies provided them with water and food.  West
African peacekeepers in Monrovia, Liberia took steps to prevent Liberians from
boarding outgoing ships.</tt><p>
<tt>Nigeria led the 16-member Economic Community of West African States
peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, established in 1990 to keep the peace in Liberia.
However, many Liberians renamed the peacekeeping group "Everything That Could
Move Is Gone," a reference to the peacekeepers tendency to strip Liberia of
everything from its mineral wealth to factory equipment.  There were apparently
stolen UN vehicles and equipment on the Bulk Challenge ship.</tt><p>
<tt>Liberia, founded in 1847 by freed American slaves, has a population of
about three million--an estimated 80 percent of Liberians have been displaced
by the ongoing civil war.</tt><p>

<tt>Data on the Foreign-Born from the October 1994 CPS.  1996.  US Department
of Labor, International Labor Affairs Bureau, Bulletin 3, May.</tt><p>
<tt>Since January 1994, the monthly Current Population Survey of households has
included information on place of birth and year of immigration.  In October
1994, there were 14 million foreign-born persons in the US labor force, and 118
million US-born workers, making foreign-born workers about 11 percent of the
132 million labor force.  Half of the foreign-born workers--6.4 million--were
Hispanic, and two-thirds of these immigrant Hispanics were born in
Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign-born men are more likely to be in the US labor force, and
foreign-born women are less likely to be in the labor force.</tt><p>
<tt>About 78 percent of foreign-born men (53 percent of foreign-born women),
and 74 percent of US-born men (59 percent of US-born women), were in the labor
force in October 1994, meaning that they were employed or unemployed and
looking for work.</tt><p>
<tt>Harris, Nigel.  1996.  The New Untouchables: Immigration And The New World
Worker.  New York: St Martin's. </tt><p>
<tt>This book argues that countries such as the United States, that define an
American way of life in cultural, political and economic terms, look at
nationality as a choice for individuals, so that immigrants are encouraged to
Americanize and naturalize.  Ethnic-origins can be reflected in hyphenations,
such as Italian-American.</tt><p>
<tt>In Europe, by contrast, the sense of nationhood is more tribal: a nation
consists of its indigenous peoples, even some who have left.</tt><p>
<tt>Harris argues that governments do not impede the movement of the rich or of
the employees of multinational corporations, and they will not be able to
restrict the migration of the unskilled.  The agents who move unskilled workers
across borders--labor workers and contractors "bore like termites through the
fortifications of the state to create supply and demand" for foreign
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Williamson, Chilton, Jr.  1996.  The Immigration Mystique: America's False
Conscience.  New York: Basic Books.</tt><p>
<tt>This book challenges the ''myth'' that immigration was always a blessing
for America.  Williamson sees the massive immigration from 1870 to the 1920s as
the start of great and disruptive changes, citing gradual but persistent
negative effects on national identity, social and political order, population
growth and the environment.</tt><p>
<tt>Today's immigrants, Williamson argues, embrace multiculturalism and
challenge the very idea of a special American identity.  Today's immigrants
allegedly press for a larger and ever-more intrusive government, thus
undermining traditional American concepts of personal liberty and
self-reliance.</tt><p>
<tt>Sowell, Thomas.  1995.  Migrations and Cultures: A World View. New York:
Basic Books.</tt><p>
<tt>In this book, Sowell asks what makes immigrants prosperous by examining six
high-achieving migrant communities, from German migrants to the Eastern Europe
and Russia to "overseas Chinese" in Asia.  The answer, according to Sowell, is
human capital -- education and skills -- and cultural capital -- risk-taking,
self-reliance, thrift, cohesion, work habits, and concern for their children's
future.  </tt><p>
<tt>There is a chapter on the migratory history of Jews, Germans, Japanese,
Chinese, Indians and Italians.  According to Sowell, "Nothing is more common
than to have poverty-stricken immigrants become prosperous in a new country and
to make that country more prosperous as well."</tt><p>
<tt>Sowell has three themes.  First, not all cultures are equal in their
ability to prosper.  Second, it makes no sense to invite immigration from the
Third World into industrial countries, since the immigrants bring with them too
little cultural capital to succeed.  Third, government intervention in
industrial countries cannot overcome the lack of cultural capital and guarantee
immigrant success.</tt><p>
<tt>Sowell repeats a theme of his earlier books that avoiding reliance on
government is the key to a group's economic success.  Thus, Sowell emphasizes
that Japanese immigrants in the US were able to prosper despite governmental
discrimination.</tt><p>

<tt>The average GNP per capita in 1994 was $4,600 in the 159 countries on which
the World Bank assembles data--it ranged from almost $40,000 for each of the
40,000 residents in Luxembourg to $130 for Ethiopians.</tt><p>
<tt>Faist, Thomas. 1995.  Social Citizenship for Whom? Young Turks in Germany
and Mexican Americans in the United States.  Avebury: Aldershot, England.
</tt><p>
<tt>This three-part, 248-page book compares the different systems of two
countries to integrate young adults into the labor market.  The study compares
Turks in Germany and Mexicans in the United States, both of whom have similar
disadvantaged situations.  The author recommends a guaranteed income for school
leavers to help them transition to the labor market.  </tt><p>
<tt>The first part of the book outlines the theoretical framework of how the
school-work proceeds.  The second part explores the empirical research by the
author in the cities of Duisburg, Germany and Chicago.  Part three summarizes
the findings and offers policy recommendations for eliminating the second-class
citizenship of many Turks in German and Mexican-Americans.</tt><p>
<tt>Menchaca, Martha. 1995. The Mexican Outsiders: A Community History of
Marginalization and Discrimination in California.  University of Texas Press:
Austin, Texas.</tt><p>
<tt>A 250-page, 10-chapter paperback book is billed as an ethnographic history
about how social injustice has affected Mexicans in the United States.  The
work is based on research done in Santa Paula, California.  The first chapter
describes the land tenure system in California in the late eighteenth century,
and then moves on to how this resulted in "social separateness" in the
community in the 19th century.  </tt><p>
<tt>The book includes chapters on: school segregation, farm labor unions,
desegregation attempts, segmentation of the farm labor market and racism.

<tt>Bach, Robert.  1996.  Becoming American, Seeking Justice.  This report
presents the results of 2,500 telephone and 700 in-person interviews with
"working poor" immigrants in the US--practically all persons had incomes low
enough to participate in assistance programs, and about 30 percent received
public assistance.</tt><p>
<tt>The focus of the interviews was on the legal needs of immigrants, and their
major need was for legal assistance to deal with housing issues--one in three
had a housing problem, and 20 percent thought they had been discriminated
against in housing.  Auto-related consumer problems were second, and problems
with health care providers were third.  Immigrants were more satisfied with the
help that they got from non-lawyer notarios (70 percent satisfaction) than they
were with the help that they got from legal assistance lawyers (54 percent
satisfaction).</tt><p>

House of Representatives in March, 1996, and by the Senate in May 1996,
advocates flooded House-Senate conference committee members with arguments for
and against specific provisions in one or both bills.</tt><p>
<tt>The House is not expected to formally name the members who will serve on
the conference committee until Congress returns from the July 4 recess, in part
because, once the House names its conferees, a conference bill must be produced
within a limited time.  However, deals between likely House and announced
Senate conferees are being worked out privately.</tt><p>
<tt>The major provision attacked by admissionists and political liberals was
the Gallegly amendment to the House bill, approved by a vote of 257 to 163 in
March 1996.  It would permit the states to deny unauthorized alien children
free K-12 public education, as California has sought to do with Prop 187.
Opponents of the Gallegly amendment argued that it was unfair to penalize
children for the fact that their parents illegally brought them into the US,
and pointed to the danger to US society of having uneducated children in its
midst, and to the costs of verifying each child's legal status.</tt><p>
<tt>In addition, immigration advocates tried to soften or eliminate the
provisions of the House and Senate bills that would define the receipt of
means-tested federal benefits by legal immigrants as violating the existing
prohibition of becoming a "public charge," and thus making possible the
deportation of legal migrants on that ground.</tt><p>
<tt>Campaigning in California on June 19, Bob Dole, the Republican presidential
candidate, endorsed the Gallegly amendment, saying that states should have the
choice of denying public education to illegal alien children, since they bear
the costs, which Dole put at $1.8 billion annually to California.  Rep. Elton
Gallegly (R-CA) introduced Dole and asserted that "it's time to stop making
apologies for putting Americans first."  House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.)
says that "offering free, tax-paid goods to illegals has increased the number
of illegals."</tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton has hinted that he will veto an immigration reform bill
that includes the Gallegly amendment, a veto that some Republicans believe
would hurt Clinton's chances of winning California in the presidential
election.  In this, Clinton had the support of 47 Senators, including five
Republicans, who threatened on June 10 to vote against a final immigration bill
that included the Gallegly amendment. </tt><p>
<tt>Dole supported Prop 187 in 1994, which Clinton opposed.</tt><p>
<tt>If the Gallegly amendment becomes law, and is upheld by a US Supreme Court
reversal of the 1982 Plyler v Doe decision, states will be able to order K-12
schools to check the status of all enrolling students each year.  Such checks
would keep out the estimated 600,000 to 700,000 or 1.5 percent unauthorized
children among the 45 million K-12 pupils in public schools.  Another six
million children who attend private schools would not be affected.  </tt><p>
<tt>The cost of educating illegal alien children in the US is $3 to $3.5
billion per year, based on an average cost of $5,000 per child per year.  The
Urban Institute estimated the number of illegal alien children in schools in
the seven major immigrant states in 1994: California, 307,000; Florida, 97,000;
Texas, 94,000; New York, 88,000; Illinois, 24,000; New Jersey, 16,000; and
Arizona, 15,000.</tt><p>
<tt>There was similar lobbying over the sponsorship and benefit changes
included in the bill that affect legal immigrants.  Under US immigration law,
an immigrant is deportable if he/she becomes a "public charge" in the US.  In
order to secure an immigration visa for a relative, US-resident sponsors
commonly sign an affidavit promising to support the immigrant once he/she is
here.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under current practice, the US sponsor and the immigrant must have a
combined income that is at least 100 percent of the income at the US poverty
line for the US sponsor AND the immigrant(s) being sponsored.  At the present
time, that would be, for example, $18,220 for a US family of three sponsoring
an immigrant couple--five people in all.</tt><p>
<tt>Many immigrants who are sponsored by US residents nonetheless apply for
federally-funded benefits after they arrive.  US courts have held that the
sponsors' affidavits are not binding, so that the government cannot sue a US
sponsor for the welfare benefits that were paid to an immigrant whom the
sponsor promised to support.  </tt><p>
<tt>The pending immigration bills would raise the income required of US
residents to sponsor an immigrant to 200 percent of the poverty line (House) or
125 percent of the poverty line (Senate), make the affidavits binding on the US
sponsor, and deem or assume that the immigrant has access to the sponsor's
income for the purpose of determining whether the immigrant is eligible for
benefits.  </tt><p>
<tt>Advocates for immigration attacked the income requirement for sponsors,
arguing that it would permit only "rich Americans" to sponsor
immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Another provision in the proposed law would permit the deportation of
immigrants who received federal benefits for 12 months within the first five
years in the US (Senate) or first seven years (House), the immigrant could be
deported.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most groups favorable to immigration opposed this extension of the grounds
for deportation, calling attention to the wide range of benefit claims that
could lead to deportation, including e.g., federal student loans and job
training programs, and outlining the health threat to US residents from
immigrants who avoided obtaining subsidized medical care.  Using cases of
immigrants who received training or education and now are successful, advocates
asked whether the US would really deport successful immigrants.  For example,
an estimated 500,000 legal immigrant college students receive $700 million in
federal assistance each year, and many are employed by major US corporations.
</tt><p>
<tt>The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the proposed restrictions on
immigrant access to benefits could save federal taxpayers up to $7 billion over
seven years.  Many members of Congress said that they supported the
restrictions on immigrant access to federal benefits to balance the budget, not
to discourage immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>In attacking the denial of federally subsidized health benefits, advocates
stressed that services such as public health cut public expenditures in the
long run by minimizing the spread of communicable diseases, avoiding emergency
room care for treatable diseases, and improving the health of US-citizen
babies.  </tt><p>
<tt>One issue that arises in these proposed new restrictions on access to
schools, benefits, and health is their administrative costs.  Opponents of the
restrictions argue that the cost of checking the legal status of pupils
enrolling in school or seeking benefits would be formidable.</tt><p>
<tt>Proponents of restrictions, on the other hand, argue that administrative
costs would be a marginal addition to current screening procedures.  Schools
already verify age, residence, and immunization, for example, and the income of
beneficiaries of means-tested programs is checked, since they will not be
reimbursed if they provide benefits to persons with incomes above qualifying
levels.</tt><p>
<tt>This suggests two major considerations in evaluating the arguments.  First,
how much money would the restrictions save in the short and long runs?  Second,
would the benefit restrictions have as a side effect the discouragement of
legal immigrants likely to need tax-supported benefits?  </tt><p>
<tt>The Gallegly amendment is perhaps the clearest example of a possible new
trend in industrial democracies--use integration policy to affect immigration
flows. The theory is that fewer benefits will discourage illegal immigrants
from coming, or staying.</tt><p>
<tt>Research suggests that illegal aliens generally come to the US for jobs,
not welfare or other benefits, so the restrictions on benefits for legal
immigrants may wind up pushing what is now in part a federal responsibility
onto states, cities, and families without affecting the influx of illegal
immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration may remain in the political spotlight during the summer of 1996
if Dole seriously tries to win California's 54 electoral votes, one-fifth of
the number needed to be elected President.  The Reform Party of Ross Perot may
also keep immigration in the spotlight if it nominates as its presidential
candidate Richard Lamm, the former governor of Colorado and an outspoken
opponent of high levels of immigration. </tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt><u>Border Control.</u>  On May 28, 1996, the INS announced that it was
adding 185 agents to patrol the eastern parts of San Diego county to curb
illegal alien entries from Mexico.  In addition, 11 FBI agents have been
assigned to deal with alien smuggling rings.</tt><p>
<tt>Border apprehension data, released monthly, are now reported in the press.
In May 1996, apprehensions were three percent below levels of twelve months
earlier, the first decrease since the December 1994 peso devaluation.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the San Diego sector, 40,761 illegal aliens were apprehended in May
1996, versus 67,282 in May 1995; 6,078 in El Centro versus 4,271; 3,189 in Yuma
versus 2,408; 28,604 in Tuscon versus 20,613; 13,435 in El Paso versus 10,722;
1,105 in Marfa versus 965; 11,338 in Del Rio versus 7,007; 11,828 in Laredo
versus 9629; and 19,899 in McAllen versus 17,277.</tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton requested $3.1 billion for the INS in FY97.  The INS now
has 5,200 Border Patrol agents, and 600 more are in training.</tt><p>
<tt>One unanticipated effect of Operation Gatekeeper is that aliens attempting
entry in eastern San Diego county have started fires in remote areas that are
difficult for firefighters to reach.  On June 5, 1996, supervisors declared an
emergency in eastern San Diego county after 212 fires broke out between January
and May 1996, up from 64 in the same period in 1995.  San Diego county asked
the federal government for funds and permission to build roads through
environmentally sensitive areas to control the fires.</tt><p>
<tt>In mid-June, five illegal aliens believed to be on the search for work in
California were found dead in the Arizona desert, reminding observers that in
July 1980, 13 Salvadorans died trying to cross the Organ Pipe National Monument
south of Ajo, Arizona.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS and Congress continue to debate how to best utilize additional
personnel and money to reduce illegal immigration.  Congress would like to see
a concentrated effort to halt immigration at the border.  The INS contend that
they should make decisions regarding enforcement, and not be dictated to across
the country by members of Congress.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS and Congress are arguing over the fate of the San Clemente,
California inland border checkpoint.  On weekends, northbound traffic headed
for Los Angeles can back up for hours on Interstate 5 as 100 Border Patrol
agents inspect cars for illegal aliens-- illegal alien smuggling is
concentrated on the weekends.  The INS plans a $13-million project to add two
lanes, an administrative office, and all-weather canopies for the Border Patrol
agents.</tt><p>
<tt>Legislation to fund the project required that construction begin by July 1
or the checkpoint would be closed down.  Construction is not scheduled until
the winter of 1996.  The checkpoint faces a shutdown during construction or if
the Border Patrol finds it cannot keep the lanes operating 24 hours a day,
which is required by law.  The Border Patrol hopes to use a clause in the
legislation which says that if the July 1 deadline is not met, it can be
circumvented if the attorney general certifies that "exigent circumstances"
exist. </tt><p>
<tt>The INS and Congress also continue to haggle over the construction of a
fence through a 14-mile stretch of border between the Pacific Ocean and Otay
Mountain.</tt><p>
<tt>A May 30 National Public Radio story on illegal immigrants from Cotija,
Michoacan, a town of 20,000 in summer, and 30,000 in Janaury, when migrants are
home, reported that daily wages were $50 to $100 in the US, versus $5 in
Cotija.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 10, 1996, on his 24th visit to California since he took office in
January 1993, President Clinton promised to do more to prevent illegal
immigration and drug smuggling across the Mexico-US border.  According to
Clinton, since January 1995, 1,700 illegal aliens have been jailed in the
United States after having slipped back into the country following their
expulsions.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS still has in custody some of the 286 Chinese aliens who were on the
Golden Venture, the ship that went aground in New York harbor on June 6, 1993.
An estimated 100,000 Chinese, some paying $25,000 to $35,000 each, are believed
to be smuggled into the US each year. </tt><p>
<tt>A Justice Department investigation found that senior officials of the INS
transferred or released more than 100 illegal immigrants from detention in
Miami in 1995 in order to hide overcrowding and understaffing from the
Congressional Task Force on Immigration Reform.  As a consequence, four senior
INS officials were relieved of their supervisory duties. </tt><p>
<tt>Many of the detainees who were released by INS were Cubans or Haitians had
not received medical clearance or faced criminal charges. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Employer Sanctions</u>.  The INS in October 1995 launched raids on some
of the estimated 2,500 of the 6,000 sewing shops in New York City believed to
be operating in violation of labor and immigration laws.  There are believed to
be some 22,000 garment contractors in the entire US.  </tt><p>
<tt>By June 2, 1996, 86 shops had been inspected in New York City.  Forty-five
INS inspectors, almost triple the usual 17 inspectors, apprehended 1,228
unauthorized workers.  About 80 percent of the unauthorized workers apprehended
were Mexicans or Salvadorans.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS hopes that, by targeting industries known to employ unauthorized
workers, it can make employers less likely to hire them, and that illegal
aliens will thus be discouraged from coming to the US.  INS therefore looks to
the number of job slots freed up for workers legally resident in the US, and
the wages that they can earn in these jobs, as measures of its success.  The
INS operates a pilot program in the New York garment industry that permits
employers to check on the legal status of non-US citizens hired to work.</tt><p>
<tt>In an account of June 3 critical of INS enforcement procedures, the New
York Times reported that most of the illegal workers were released back on the
streets the very day they were apprehended.  During the first ten months of the
factory inspection program, according to the report, only about 25 percent were
detained for more than a few hours.  Apprehended workers are often freed
pending a hearing to determine whether they should be ordered to leave the US,
a proceeding usually two to five months after their apprehension.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS apprehended 12,000 illegal alien workers in US workplaces in
FY95.</tt><p>
<tt>Kathie Lee Gifford, a TV talk show host, found that fashions bearing her
name were sewn in a New York City sweatshop.  She held a joint press conference
in June 1996 with Labor Secretary Robert Reich to announce a July 1996
conference in Washington DC to bring together retailers, manufacturers and
celebrities to discuss how to fight sweatshops.  Gifford earned $9 million in
1995 from her line of clothing.</tt><p>
<tt>Two interesting aspects of the subject emerged.  First, the garment
industry is one of the few US industries in which someone can become a sizable
US employer--with 25 or more employees--for an investment of less than $50,000.
Poorly-capitalized sewing shops are vulnerable to market changes, as well as
stepped up enforcement--many do not pay overtime wages on rush jobs from
manufacturers for hot-selling garments.</tt><p>
<tt>Second, there is a radical difference between New York state labor
inspectors and INS workplace inspectors.  The INS inspectors are concerned only
about the workers' legal status, but not their wages or working conditions,
while the state inspectors care about wages but not legal status.  Indeed, in
New York, California and other states with high levels of immigration, there is
an explicit policy by state labor inspectors, who are often the most familiar
with local employers, of NOT cooperating with the INS (the 800 federal labor
inspectors are, on the other hand, obliged to report suspected immigration
violations to the 300 INS inspectors nationwide).</tt><p>
<tt>In many European countries, by contrast, the agency with the most labor
market expertise, the labor agency, has responsibility for detecting and
removing unauthorized workers from the work place.  European labor agencies
often see removing illegal workers as a means of protecting legal
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The US-based National Labor Committee charged that half of the 29 sewing
firms that make garments in Haiti for US firms such as Disney, JC Penny, and
other US retailers pay less than Haiti's $2.40 per day minimum wage--workers
are desperate for jobs, as unemployment is 75 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>The National Labor Committee also accused Nike of paying Indonesian workers
who make its athletic shoes $0.14 per hour;  Nike countered that its Indonesian
workers earn an average $0.50 per hour, double the national minimum wage, and
receive free meals and health care.  The group, Made in the USA, charged that
basketball player Michael Jordan earns $ 20 million a year endorsing Nike
sneakers, and claimed that this is more than the total annual payroll for the
Indonesians who help make them. </tt><p>
<tt>Nike subcontractors around the world must sign a Memorandum of
Understanding that "strictly prohibits child labor, and certifies compliance
with applicable government regulations regarding minimum wage, (and)
overtime."</tt><p>
<tt><u>Smuggling.</u>  The INS on May 29 announced that it had arrested a woman
operating in Reynosa, Mexico, who was making over $1 million annually smuggling
South Asians and Chinese into the US via Central America and Mexico.  In
December 1995, the INS estimated that up to 100,000 South Asians and Chinese
may be smuggled into the US in this way each year.</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexican legislature is considering increasing penalties for alien
smuggling, and doubling the maximum prison term for alien smuggling to 20
years.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Asylum.</u> On June 13, 1996, the US Board of Immigration Appeals in an
11-1 decision granted asylum to a Togo woman who asked for asylum in the US
because, she asserted, she faced female genital mutilation in Togo.  A US
immigration judge rejected her application for asylum in August 1995, but the
ruling is binding on the nation's 179 immigration judges.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS had asked the BIA to return the case to the immigration judge for
rehearing after BIA adopted the INS position that asylum could be granted to
women who fear forced mutilation without consent, and have no opportunity to
move to avoid the practice, as to a city in their  country.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 85 million women, mostly in Africa, are believed to have been
subjected to female genital mutilation.  Begun in the 5th century BC, the
custom is observed by Muslims, Christians and adherents of traditional
religions in Africa and Asia.  The Senate immigration reform bill would make
mutilation of female genitalia a federal crime punishable by up to five years
in prison, but would not make the threat of such mutilation the basis for an
asylum claim.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS reported in May 1996 that it processes 80 percent of the asylum
applications it receives within 60 days after they are filed.</tt><p>

Voting Rights and Emigration</a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt><u>Voting Rights</u>.  In mid-June, Mexico's major political parties, the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the left-leaning Democratic
Revolutionary Party (PRD), and the conservative National Action Party (PAN),
agreed to permit Mexican citizens living outside the country to vote in the
next Presidential election, scheduled for 2000.  There are at least 7 million
Mexican nationals living in the US, and Mexicans abroad are expected to cast 1
to 5 million votes--there were 35 million votes cast in the 1994 Mexican
Presidential election.</tt><p>
<tt>It is not yet clear how Mexicans in the US would vote.  US citizens abroad
mail ballots to the US--some 2 million ballots were mailed to the US in 1992.
However, Mexico's opposition parties oppose mail ballots, fearing fraud.</tt><p>
<tt>How would US citizens react to Mexican candidates campaigning for votes in
California and other places where Mexican nationals live?  Some fear that
Mexican flags would increase anti-Mexican sentiment in the US.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Emigration</u>.  An analysis of Mexican data suggests that 55 percent of
the Mexico-to-US migration between 1985 and 1990 was from an urban area of
Mexico to an urban destination in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The National Institute for Statistics, Geography and Information (INEGI)
estimated that Mexico had 91.1 million residents in 1995, up 10 million since
1990.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Greater Mexico City, which includes 27 suburbs, was home to 16.4 million
people - considerably fewer than previous estimates of 23 million
residents.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Labor Market</u>.  Mexico's economy shrank one percent in the first
quarter of 1996, less than the three percent projected.  However, many small
businesses are struggling because of debts that they assumed in the boom year
of 1994, and their debts have increased in 1995 and 1996.  Interest rates are
30 percent for mortgages, and 50 percent for credit card debt.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has 8 to 10 million workers in unions, but the most powerful union
leader is Don Fidel Valazquez, leader of the three million strong CTM.</tt><p>
<tt>The NAFTA-created Commission on Labor Cooperation in Dallas released its
annual report on labor markets in Canada, Mexico, and the US in May 1996, and
reported that real wages fell since 1984 in all three countries.  In Mexico,
for example, real wages fell sharply between 1984 and 1988, then began to
increase in the late 1980s, and were above 1984 levels in 1994.  However, in
1995, real Mexican wages fell again, to five percent below their 1984
levels.</tt><p>
<tt>US real earnings were down eight percent between 1984 and 1995, and
Canadian real earnings were unchanged.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has the smallest proportion of full-time employees among NAFTA
countries--57 percent, versus 84 percent in Canada and 91 percent in the US.
In the US, 57 percent of the women in the labor force worked full time, versus
49 percent of the women in Mexico, and 37 percent of the women in
Canada.</tt><p>
<tt>Virtually all of the job growth between 1984 and 1995 in the US and Canada
was in services, versus 81 percent of the job growth in Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt>Forbes Magazine published an upbeat story on "Maquiladora-ville," or
Tijuana, on May 6, 1996, which asserted that Tijuana's population of 1.5
million is growing by seven percent or 105,000 per year as Mexicans flock to
Tijuana for maquiladora jobs.  Forbes reported that many maquiladora workers
live in shanty towns without running water, and that absenteeism and turnover
are problems for factory managers.</tt><p>
<tt>As of April 1996, 701,141 Mexicans were employed in maquiladoras, up 13
percent over April 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt><u>Grupo Beta.</u>  Mexico has special police units known as Grupo Alpha,
Beta etc whose purpose is to prevent crimes being committed against aliens
seeking to leave Mexico for the US.  In June, 1996, Mexico announced the
formation of a 20 to 30 person<u> </u>Grupo Beta Sur, an independent police
force in the southern state of Chiapas.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has criticized the US for videotaped beatings of illegal Mexican
immigrants, but President Zedillo reportedly asserted that he fears "that one
day they will make a video . . . of what happens when some of our Central
American brothers are intercepted by Mexican authorities."  Many of the
smugglers who charge $1,000 each to smuggle Central Americans through Mexico
and into the US are linked to criminal gangs.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has been returning to Guatemala about 350 Central  Americans daily.
Mexico's National Migration Institute reported that 105,063 foreigners were
deported from Mexico in 1995, including 575 from India and 184 from
China.</tt><p>
<tt>The fifth year of drought in Mexico may be increasing emigration pressure
in Chihuahua, Sonora, Coahuila, Sinaloa, Tamaulipas, and Nuevo Leon.  Many
farmers have sold cattle rather than feed them--contributing to lower US beef
prices--and fewer acres of corn were planted because of the lack of water,
increasing Mexican corn imports.</tt><p>
<tt>There were widespread rumors in June of a possible coup against President
Zedillo sometime after December 1, 1996.  Under Mexican law, after a president
has served at least two years of a six-year term, he can be replaced by a
person from the ruling party.  Reportedly, powerful PRI functionaries fear that
continuing social chaos and a still stagnant economy will cause the PRI to lose
badly in 1997 mid-term elections and would like to find a more attractive
candidate to lead their party.</tt><p>

Internal Migration and Strikes</a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt><u>Internal Migration</u>.  California in July 1995 had an estimated 32
million residents, reflecting 569,000 births in 1994-95, 222,000 deaths,
260,000 net foreign immigrants, and a net 334,000 California residents who
moved to other states.  According to a new analysis by the California
Department of Finance, the net number of residents moving to other states
exceeded the net number of immigrants to California in 1992-93, 1993-94, and
1994-95.</tt><p>
<tt>California lost a net 143,000 residents to other states in 1995, reflecting
the slowdown in the state's population growth in the first half of the
1990s.</tt><p>
<tt>During the 1980s, California gained a net 1.25 million residents from the
other 49 states.  Between 1990 and 1995, California lost a net 1.55 million
residents to other states.  California gained a net 1.4 million immigrants in
the first half of the 1990s, or almost 300,000 per year.</tt><p>
<tt>California, which had an estimated population of 31.6 million in 1995, is
expected to have 41 million residents in 2010.  California's population growth
is fueled by births (over 600,000 per year) and immigration (over 300,000 per
year).</tt><p>
<tt>In reviewing population growth since 1980, demographer Hans Johnson notes
that California's population increased by 500,000 in 1980, a peak 900,000 in
1989, and then 100,000 in 1993.  Johnson's estimates, based, inter alia, on the
assumption that 91 percent of the 18 to 64 year-old residents have drivers'
licenses, and treating net illegal immigration as a residual after all other
factors affecting the number of California residents have been taken into
account, suggest that there was very high unauthorized immigration to
California in the late 1980s, as well as a high outmigration of US-born
residents to other states.  </tt><p>
<tt>Estimates of illegal immigration based on apprehension data, by contrast,
report declining illegal immigration in the late 1980s.</tt><p>
<tt>In the March 1995 CPS, there were 23 million foreign-born persons in the
US, including 6.7 million who were born in Mexico, 1.2 million born in the
Philippines, 0.8 million born each in Cuba and China, and more than 0.6 million
each born in Canada, El Salvador, and Germany.  Two-thirds of the Mexican
immigrants reported that they arrived since 1980--2.6 million in the 1980s, and
1.7 million or 345,000 per year in the 1990s.</tt><p>
<tt>The employment-to-population ratio of recent immigrants is declining.  In
1960, 93 percent of the 18-64 foreign-born males who arrived in the previous
five years and were not in school were employed or looking for work, 88 percent
in 1970, 81 percent in 1980, and 80 percent in 1990.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Immigrant Strikes.</u>  In Los Angeles, a month-old boycott by many of
the 6,500 largely immigrant truck drivers at the port in Long Beach fizzled
out, as most truckers returned to work.  The drivers are considered
"independent contractors" by the firms that hire them to deliver freight.  The
truckers agreed to stop delivering freight when they were promised $25 per hour
if they forced shipping firms to use a single trucking company.</tt><p>
<tt>It appears that, in the future, pressure on the truck drivers will grow as
more shipping companies transfer containers directly from ships to rail cars
for distribution throughout the US.  Los Angeles handles about 25 percent of US
ocean-going freight.</tt><p>
<tt>Also in Los Angeles, nine Chinese immigrants who had been smuggled into the
US, and were being held hostage until their relatives in Fujian came up with
more money to pay the smugglers, escaped after shooting one of the smugglers.
The nine had paid $3,000 of the $15,000 fee in China, and the smugglers
demanded an additional $20,000 once the Chinese were in Los Angeles.</tt><p>
<tt>Mounted Los Angeles police were used in a first-ever effort in mid-June to
patrol a popular gathering spot for day laborers in the western San Fernando
Valley, on Fallbrook Avenue south of Ventura Boulevard in Woodland Hills.
Gathering on a street corner to look for work is not illegal in Los
Angeles.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Criminal Aliens.</u>  The California State Senate rejected a nonbinding
resolution urging Congress to station an immigration officer are each jail in
California to make sure illegal immigrants who are arrested are
deported.</tt><p>
<tt>The Anaheim Police Officers Association asked their city council to pass a
resolution that called for federal legislation to make it a felony offense to
be in the US without the proper documentation and to allow local, county and
state law enforcement agencies to arrest suspected illegal immigrants. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Benefits and Costs.</u>  A new study by the Tomas Rivera Center found
that, over the course of their lifetimes, immigrants contribute more in taxes
to California than they cost in government services.</tt><p>
<tt>The report found that the average immigrant costs the state of California
about $62,600 in educational expenditures.  However, when lifetime tax payments
are adjusted to reflect what is repaid solely in education taxes, the immigrant
will return about $89,437.  According to the study, taxes for education plus
those for social programs are $24,493 for legal immigrants, and $7,890 for
illegal aliens.</tt><p>
<tt>About nine percent of the foreign-born mothers aged 14 to 44 were on AFDC,
compared to 11 percent of the native-born mothers in the same age group.</tt><p>
<tt>Polls suggest that, from 1965 to 1993, the proportion of Americans favoring
increased immigration has been stable at about seven percent.  The number of
respondents favoring less immigration, however, rose from 33 percent in 1965 to
61 percent in 1993.  A December 1995 Roper poll reported that 70 percent of the
respondents favor fewer than 300,000 immigrants a year.</tt><p>
<tt>Sixteen percent of a 500-person sample of Latinos in Los Angeles metro area
reported experiencing racism or discrimination in the US.  The sample was
composed of 55 percent legal immigrant, 29 percent US citizens and 16 percent
unauthorized immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Nearly 10,000 immigrants took their oaths of citizenship on June 19 in the
first of several mass ceremonies planned in Los Angeles.  In June, 1996, 38,000
new citizens are expected take the oath in Southern California.  The
seven-county southern California region is expected to account for nearly
one-third of a record one million new citizens nationwide.  </tt><p>
<tt>The rise in the number of immigrants seeking citizenship is attributed to
several factors including increased the anti-immigrant initiatives and proposed
legislation to reduce benefits for legal and illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Economic Growth.</u>  California's economy appears to be rebounding.
The unemployment rate dropped to 7.5 percent in April 1996, and about 561,000
net new jobs have been added in California since January 1993--at current
rates, California is adding about 300,000 net new jobs per year, or almost
1,000 per day.</tt><p>
<tt>California received an average $4853 in federal spending for each of its
31.4 million residents in 1995, less than the $5161 US average.  Half of the
$152.5 billion in federal payments were Social Security checks.</tt><p>

Update in New York, Florida and

<tt>New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on June 6 criticized Bob Dole for
supporting immigration legislation that would restrict federal aid to
immigrants.  According to Giuliani, Republicans should not follow public
opinion polls that show broad support for measures to curb illegal immigrants,
and to reduce assistance for immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Giuliani also criticized a provision of the pending immigration bill that
would require state and local agencies to notify the INS if they detect illegal
aliens.  New York has since 1984 prohibited city agencies from cooperating with
the INS.</tt><p>
<tt>Huntington Station in Long Island, New York has been battling
concentrations of day laborers at city corners--one street corner has between
125 to 150 men each day looking for jobs.  Local business owners say the
immigrant workers are dangerous, because they stand on a traffic island during
the rush hour.</tt><p>
<tt>Business leaders tried to move the day laborers to a park down the street,
but local residents said they didn't want unemployed men hanging around the
children's park and near the school bus stop.  </tt><p>
<tt>A compromise was made to move the day laborers to a parking a lot a block
away from the park, but no one told the immigrant workers, who remain on the
traffic island. </tt><p>
<tt>Attorney General Janet Reno and Florida Governor Lawton Chiles announced in
May the expansion of programs to halt illegal immigration into Florida,
including an airport court at Miami International Airport to deal with
foreigners who arrive in the US without proper documents.  The INS will also
establish a detention center at the airport.  Chiles announced that he will
soon sign an executive order forbidding the state to contract with any employer
known to hire illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 17, Chiles traveled to Haiti to discuss illegal immigration with
Haitian President Rene Preval.  </tt><p>
<tt>Immigration lawyers are increasingly filing petitions for dependency for
minor children who are abandoned in the US by parents who send them to the US
to live with relatives.  The ward of the state procedure was developed to help
social workers get US children out of abusive homes, but the INS grants
immigrant status to minors whom US courts declare to be wards.</tt><p>
<tt>The Farmworkers Coordinating Council in Boynton Beach says that "hundreds"
of 10 to 17 year-old minors who left their families in Mexico or Central
America are working in South Florida agricultural fields.</tt><p>
<tt>The Latino Institute and the Urban Institute issued a report on May 16
estimating that the 244,000 unauthorized immigrants in Illinois pay about $547
million annually in taxes, and receive $238 million in services--virtually all
of the expenditures were for providing K-12 education to an estimated 33,000
unauthorized children at an average annual cost of $7,000.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are believed to be about 138,000 unauthorized Mexicans in Chicago,
followed by 47,000 Poles. </tt><p>
<tt>The seven taxes included in the study are federal and state income, state
and local sales, property, Social Security and Unemployment Insurance. The
social-service programs include Supplemental Security Income; Aid to Families
with Dependent Children; Aid to Aged, Blind and Disabled; Transitional
Assistance; Medicaid; and K-12 public education.</tt><p>
<tt>On April 29, 1996, a Save Our State-Arizona initiative was filed with the
Arizona Secretary of  State's Office.  If organizers obtain the 112,961 valid
signatures to place the measure on the November election ballot, Arizona voters
will decide whether to make employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants
legally liable for damages.  The initiative would also create a state
"verification center" to determine whether job applicants have legal
documents.</tt><p>

Immigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>More than 435,000 Cubans--about four percent of that nation's population--
applied in the US visa lottery that closed April 30, 1996 for about 6,000 slots
to enter the US.  The lottery is part of a 1994 agreement between the United
States and Cuba to allow at least 20,000 Cubans a year to immigrate to the
United States. </tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, over 190,000 Cubans applied for US immigration visas, and 5,398
were granted visas.</tt><p>
<tt>Since early 1996, more than 60 Cubans arrived in Jamaica seeking political
asylum.  The Jamaican government is considering the approval of a draft
agreement to repatriate the illegal Cuban immigrants.  The document was signed
by Cuban officials on May 15. </tt><p>
<tt>The 60 illegal Cuban immigrants join another 60 who arrived on the island
between 1994 and 1995.  Some of the original asylum seekers were given work
permits and visas.  Some have fled Jamaica for Puerto Rico rather than risk
repatriation to Cuba. </tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 Haitians in the Dominican
Republic at any one time, working mainly on sugar and rice plantations.  On
April 30, some Haitians living illegally in the Dominican Republic were
repatriated.  Immigration is one of the many points of tension between the
Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic and Creole/French-speaking Haiti.</tt><p>
<tt>In Haiti, the government is worried about "hundreds" convicted criminals
begin returned from the US, Canada, and France, where many resume their lives
of crime with drive-by shootings, carjackings, and kidnappings.  The risk of
arrest for crime is low in Haiti, given a newly formed, inexperienced police
force, and an overwhelmed justice system.</tt><p>
<tt>The proportion of foreign workers in Bermuda has risen to 22 percent of the
workforce; there were 7,521 foreigners and  26,612 Bermudans employed in
1995.</tt><p>
<tt>In January 1995, Costa Rica began to tighten checks on Nicaraguans who
enter the country.  Costa Rica estimates that 475,000 Nicaraguans live in Costa
Rica, more than half of them illegally.  Tensions flared in March 1995, when
Nicaragua detained 13 Costa Rican border guards that it maintained chased a
Nicaraguan into the country. </tt><p>
<tt>In June 1995, Costa Rica announced plans to grant six-month temporary work
permits to some of the 175,000 Nicaraguans who come into the country every year
as seasonal farm workers for the sugar cane and coffee harvests --the Costa
Rican government gives the permits to employers, who in turn give them to
foreign workers.</tt><p>

<tt><u>Asylum</u>.  The number of asylum seekers in the 15 EU member states,
plus Norway and Switzerland, decreased by 11 percent to 290,000 in 1995, down
from 325,000 in 1994, according to a report by Eurostat.  Germany received 47
percent of the asylum applications in 1995, up from 41 percent in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Western  Europe, Australia, Canada and the US received a total of 468,000
asylum applications in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of asylum applicants from ex-Yugoslavia and Romania fell in
1995, but there was an increase in applicants from Turkey, Iraq, and
Pakistan.</tt><p>
<tt><u>EU Immigration Controls</u>.  The Guardian newspaper reported in June
that interior and justice ministers in November 1993 planned for a "Fortress
Europe" policy on immigration.  According to the Guardian, the plan to
fingerprint all asylum seekers in the EU was launched in the summer of 1993,
and approved by the EU Council of Ministers in November 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Eastern European nations have displaced developing African and Asian
nations as the major source of foreign prostitutes in Western Europe, according
to the European Commissioner for Justice, Anita Gradin at a June 17 press
conference.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some 200,000 to 500,000 women are involved.  Many are young; 75 percent
were under 25 in one study, including many aged 15 to 18.  Most traveled to
Western Europe on tourist visas.  In Germany, foreign prostitutes make up about
75 percent of the total, in Italy, 80 percent, and in Austria, 85
percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Many countries want penalties for smuggling aliens increased.  Drug
smuggling typically results in prison terms of 10 to 12 years, versus one to
two years for smuggling aliens.  Studies released by the European Commission
have found that there is growing collusion between drugs and arms traffickers
and those involved in smuggling women.  EU states were urged to offer special
protections to women willing to testify against traffickers.   </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC10">Germans
Consider Immigration Policy</a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt><u>Immigration Policy</u>  On June 18, German President Roman Herzog called
for immigration in order to increase the size of the working population and
thus save Germany's pension system.  In a speech to the German Federation of
Industry (BDI) in Bonn, Herzog said that "an active immigration policy," plus
raising the retirement age and increasing the number of women working, were
essential to preserving Germany's social welfare state.</tt><p>
<tt>The Free Democrats (FDP) on June 10, 1996 called for permitted annual level
based in part on conditions in the German labor and housing market.  Such a
system would open new doors to immigrants wishing to move to Germany.  Under
current immigration law, foreigners can settle in Germany if they are joining
their families or if they are successful asylum seekers (ethnic Germans from
the ex-USSR can also settle in Germany as German citizens).</tt><p>
<tt>The FDP also called for easier naturalization for foreign children born in
Germany.  Party leader and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel asserted that "It must
be easier for foreigners whose lives center on Germany in the long term to have
access to German citizenship," suggesting that third-generation foreigners born
in Germany should become Germans by birth.</tt><p>
<tt>Kinkel also said that "Germany needs an overall concept for  immigration
and integration."</tt><p>
<tt>Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) oppose set levels of
immigration, and the secretary general of the CDU sister party, the CSU,
Bernard Protzner, said that "Germany is not a land of  immigration, and we will
not make it into one.  There will be no such law (annual immigration levels) as
long as the CSU can help it."</tt><p>
<tt>There are about seven million foreigners living in Germany with 81 million
German residents, about one-fourth of the foreigners were born in
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed in 1990 to accept for humanitarian reasons an
unlimited number of Jews from what was the Soviet Union.  More than 45,000 Jews
and their relatives have come to Germany, and another 41,000 have been approved
for entry when they wish.  In May, there was talk that the government would
soon limit Jewish immigration from the ex-USSR, in part because of a rash of
forged documents in which people claimed to be Jews, but the rumors were denied
by the government.</tt><p>
<tt>Development Aid Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger said that, because there was
no quota on the number of Jews who could move to Germany from the ex-USSR,
Germany might come into "conflict with Israel which regards itself as the
homeland for the Jews."</tt><p>
<tt>Austrian Freedom Party (FPO) leader Joerg Haider on June 14, 1996 called
for unemployed foreigners to be deported.  There are an estimated 36,000
unemployed foreigners in Austria.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Vietnamese.</u>  On June 18, 1996, Vietnam announced that it was ready
to accept more than 2,000 Vietnamese living in Germany, taking the first step
toward fulfilling a July 21, 1995 agreement to take back by the year 2000 up to
40,000 of its citizens who live in Germany without residence permits in
exchange for $140 million in German aid.  The agreement called for returning
2,500 Vietnamese in 1995, and 5,000 in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 96,032 Vietnamese registered in Germany's
Auslaenderzentralregister on December 31, 1995, including 38,166 without
residence permits.  Most of those to be returned to Vietnam are Vietnamese who
applied for asylum-- only 5,000 are former East German contract workers.  In
addition, there may be another 2,000 to 20,000 "illegal Vietnamese" in
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Hanoi was criticized by the German government for delays in accepting
Vietnamese being returned from Germany.  So far, only 89 Vietnamese have been
returned, and 65 of them were convicted criminals sent home under a separate
clause of the July 1995 agreement that permits the expedited deportation of
criminals.  According to the German government, some 8,100 Vietnamese have
registered to go home.</tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam, which is also experiencing the return of 35,000 boat people in
southeast Asia, insists on verifying that all persons returning are Vietnamese.
Neighbors of Germany worry that, if the German government gets tough with the
Vietnamese staying in Germany, some may move to Hungary, Poland and the Czech
Republic.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Ethnic Germans.</u>  On May 31, the German government promised to
continue to allow ethnic German migrants to enter the country.  The German
government announced that it would prefer that the 500,000 ethnic Germans
living in Kazakhastan remain there, but that they can migrate to Germany if
they must.  Over 200,000 ethnic Germans from Kazakhastan, where wages average
$100 per month, emigrated to Germany in 1994-95. </tt><p>
<tt>The head of Kazakhastan's Council of Germans has said that the discussion
in Germany about restricting ethnic German immigration has triggered a rush of
emigration from the country.  The opposition Social Democrats proposed limiting
the influx of ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union.</tt><p>
<tt>According to reports, Foreign Minister Kinkel explained to a class of 20
young ethnic Germans that " roast chickens will not fly into your open mouths"
in Germany.  He then asked who wanted to remain in Kazakhastan, and only the
teacher did.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Bosnians.</u>  In June, 1996, Interior Minister Kanther announced that
the repatriation of Bosnians in Germany would be delayed from July 1, 1996 to
October 1, 1996.  The repatriation is expected to take 12 months.  However,
each of Germany's 16 states makes the decision on when to return Bosnians, so
that return policies can and do vary by state.</tt><p>
<tt>The Bosnian government has demanded that Germany help to pay for the cost
of resettling returning Bosnians, and that the government determine where in
Bosnia its returning Bosnians are sent.  Some of the one million Bosnians
outside Bosnia fear that if they vote in elections scheduled for September 14,
1996, they may lose their right to remain in the country where they are taking
refuge.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany anticipates an easier return of 130,000 persons to
Serbia/Yugoslavia.  The Yugoslav government is not demanding compensation to
accept the return of its nationals, and has said that young men who went to
Germany to avoid military service will not be punished.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Labor Market.</u>  On May 28, 1996, German employers rejected the
Entsendegesetz, a proposal to require foreign workers from other EU countries
to be paid at least the German minimum wages of DM 18.60 ($12) per hour in
construction in West Germany, and slightly less in the former East.
Construction employers favored the effort to prevent social dumping, but
employers from metal and textile industries feared that the construction
Entsendegesetz might set a precedent for their industries.</tt><p>
<tt>There are 350,000 unemployed German construction workers.</tt><p>
<tt>British and Irish workers earning between DM22 and DM35 an hour are getting
twice what they would at home, but far less than the DM 65 labor cost of German
workers.  Pubs serve as informal labor exchanges.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 3.8 million unemployed workers in Germany in May 1996, a 10
percent unemployment rate.  One study found that 20 percent of new PhDs seeking
academic jobs are unemployed.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC11">British
Court Strikes Down Ban on Welfare</a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>A Court of Appeal on June 21 by a 2 to 1 vote struck down as
"uncompromisingly draconian" a rule that, beginning in February 1996, denied
welfare benefits to 8000 asylum seekers who did not apply for asylum upon their
arrival in the UK.  The purpose of the restriction was to save about L200
million per year.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the judges, the lack of benefits meant that it was "not merely
difficult but totally impossible for them to remain here to pursue their asylum
claims."  A High Court ruling dating in 1803 obliges the British government to
assist "poor foreigners" while their claims to settle in Britain were
determined.  Asylum seekers are not allowed to work in the UK, and private help
for them is limited, according to the ruling.</tt><p>
<tt>The ruling was, in effect, a finding that Social Security Secretary Peter
Lilley had adopted regulations that went beyond the underlying law, and ordered
Lilley to review a denial of benefits to a 25 year old Zairean woman.  Lilley
said he feared the judgment would result in "a fresh flood of bogus claimants"
for asylum, and indicated that the decision would be appealed to the House of
Lords.  </tt><p>
<tt>Home Secretary Michael Howard withdrew other rules also aimed at making it
harder for asylum seekers to remain in the UK.  Under the withdrawn rules,
asylum applicants could be removed from the UK if they made mistakes on the new
application forms.</tt><p>
<tt>In a report on the three million minority residents in the UK, the 212,000
black Africans were found to be the best educated, largely because restrictive
immigration policies keep out unskilled workers.  The 840,000 Indians and
477,000 Pakistanis in Britain are poised to become solid members of the middle

<a name="RTFToC12">France</a></a></a></a></a>
Criticized on Asylum</a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH) in mid-June
criticized France for increasing the hurdles to asylum seekers.  It asked
France to grant asylum to Algerians who felt threatened by either the
government or fundamentalists.  The UN Human Rights Commission in April, 1996
made similar criticisms.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of asylum requests in France has been falling, from 61,422 in
1989 to 20,170 in 1995.  About 24 percent of the asylum applications handled in
1994 were approved, versus 27 percent in 1993.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 15, some 5,000 to 10,000 people marched through Paris to demand an
amnesty in the form of residency rights for settled illegal migrants.  They
also demanded residency rights for illegal migrants who have married foreigners
legally resident in  France, and for illegal alien parents of children born in
France.</tt><p>
<tt>The National Front, led by Jean-Marie Le Pen, is France's third biggest
party, after the ruling conservatives of President Jacques Chirac and the
Socialists.  The National Front blames the three million immigrants in France
for the country's 12 percent unemployment rate.  Le Pen continues to insist
that "One cannot make a French people from massive immigration... people need a
certain homogeneity...just because this immigration is done without weapons
doesn't mean it isn't an invasion."</tt><p>
<tt>When asked in a May 26, 1996 interview how many immigrants that France
should accept, Le Pen replied " Zero, zero, zero, excepting individual cases of
people who would have shown their merit regarding our country, who bring proof
of ties here."  Le Pen advocated in a speech talking about potential
immigrants: "Don't come to our country. We can't take you in and, henceforth,
you will not have access to any of the social advantages. If you want to come
here as tourists, we'd like that very much. But we can't pay for your
children's schools or your medical care. Not for any of it."</tt><p>
<tt>Morocco, a country of 29 million with a per capita income of $1000, expects
to receive about $1.2 billion in remittances in 1996, only half 1980s levels.
There are more than 2.1 million Moroccans living in Europe, most in France.
The country has become a natural transit point for African illegal immigrants
seeking to enter illegally into Europe.</tt><p>

<tt>In 1993, nearly one million foreigners were employed in Switzerland,
primarily in jobs described as the "three D's," --dirty, difficult and
dangerous.  Nearly 60 percent of the foreigners working in Switzerland are in
the construction industry, according to the Bureau of Foreign Affairs.
</tt><p>
<tt>Switzerland has among the most restrictive immigration laws on the
Continent.  Migrants are allowed to bring their families to the country only if
they can prove that they have enough money and housing.  Workers are not
allowed to change jobs unless there is a medical reason for doing so.  </tt><p>
<tt>Switzerland, which narrowly rejected a vote to join the European Economic
Area in 1992, is negotiating the free entry of EU nationals and a road
transport agreement with the EU.  Brussels wants the Swiss to eliminate work
permit quotas for EU citizens within three years and is prepared to concede a
safeguard clause allowing controls to be reimposed if there is a large influx
of illegal immigrants.  The Swiss government is willing to ease restrictions on
EU nationals followed by a possible abolition of work permit quotas and freedom
of movement for EU citizens within five years.  The Swiss foreign minister did
not promise that the talks with the EU would lead to the free circulation of
people along EU lines.  </tt><p>
<tt>The proposals were blasted by industrialist and SVP member of Parliament
Christoph Blocher, who said that any deals with Brussels on lifting immigration
limits must be voted by referendum of the Swiss voters. </tt><p>
<tt>The majority of the Swiss say they favor allowing EU nationals to live and
work in Switzerland without restrictions.  Even the four coalition parties,
employers and unions support unrestricted living and work for EU nationals.
</tt><p>
<tt>Should the Swiss government alienate public opinion during the trade
negations by moving too boldly, it could affect two referendums relating to
Europe expected to be voted on in Spring, 1998.  One referendum relates to a
pro-European bid to restart EEA talks and the other is the Blocher demand that
any negotiations on EU entry must get prior approval from the voters. </tt><p>

<tt>The Japanese government reported that the number of registered alien
residents in Japan was over 1.3 million at the end of 1995, accounting for a
record 1.09 percent of the country's population.  The number of North and South
Korean residents declined about 1.5 percent over 1994 levels, and their share
of the number of alien residents fell from 80 percent in 1985 to 64 percent in
1990, and to 48 percent in 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of Filipino residents dropped by 13 percent from the year
before, primarily due to a sharp fall in the number of people entering Japan
with permits to work as entertainers, such as singers and dancers. </tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreigners visiting Japan fell to 3.3 million in 1995, down
from a peak 3.6 million in 1992.  Japanese traveling abroad, by contrast,
jumped to 15.3 million.  Foreigners denied entry into Japan in 1995 at ports of
entry increased by 33 percent over 1994 levels.</tt><p>
<tt>The Japanese Justice Ministry announced on June 23 that there was a 15.5
percent decline in the number of illegal immigrants who were deported in 1995.
Of the 55,470 deported, 49,434 were illegally employed in Japan.  The Justice
Ministry attributes the decline in illegal employment to tighter controls and
fewer jobs due to a prolonged recession.  </tt><p>
<tt>Among the foreigners illegally employed in Japan, South Koreans were the
most numerous, followed by mainland Chinese, Thais and Filipinos.  Over 65
percent of the illegal workers were male.  About 40 percent of the illegally
employed females came from Thailand and the Philippines.  </tt><p>
<tt>Japan is considering allowing visa-free entry to holders of Hong Kong's
Special Administrative Region (SAR) passports.  Currently, Hong Kong residents
need a visa to enter Japan-- 48 countries have been given visa-free status by
Japan.  About 93,000 Hong Kong people visited Japan in 1995.</tt><p>

<tt>The Philippines, the major emigration nation in Asia, believes that there
are at least 5,000 illegal aliens living in the country who were granted visa
extensions in 1973, and then stayed in the country illegally after their
extended visas expired.  Most are believed to be businessmen with investments
in the country.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines is offering an amnesty through the Alien Social Integration
Act for some of the estimated 70,000 illegal aliens in the country.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines' Bureau of Immigration and Deportation announced on June 5
the creation of a special task force to process the amnesty applications of
undocumented residents.  The task force, composed of two immigration lawyers
and eight intelligence agents, will process applications from illegal aliens
with no criminal record who entered the country on or before June 30, 1991.
Each principal applicant will be required to pay US $7,923, spouses, US $2,154,
and children US $1,192.</tt><p>
<tt>Through the collection of fees, the task force hopes to raise 4 to 6
billion pesos by the end of the alien integration period of December 21, 1996.
As of June 1996, only 7,000 aliens applied for amnesty. </tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 13,000 Filipinos managed to leave Davao illegally for jobs in
Malaysia, Indonesia or Taiwan in 1996.  According to reports, many Filipinos
who pay money to smugglers to take them abroad lose their money when the
smuggler disappears before transporting them.</tt><p>
<tt>One report says that, in Davao, Filipinos are asked to pay 90,000 pesos (US
$3,440) for the chance to "directly work abroad," with a money-back guarantee
in case of problems.  In May, Philippine authorities seized an
Indonesian-registered boat carrying 24 Filipino workers without proper
permits.</tt><p>
<tt>Despite a Filipino government ban on the deployment of maids to Singapore,
Filipino domestic workers still head for that island nation.  The Filipino
government announced the ban after the hanging of Filipino domestic worker Flor
Contemplacion for murdering her employer.  A Filipino maid earns about S$280
per month in Singapore.  A Philippine government official says that between 100
to 200 Filipino maids arrive in Singapore each week.  A UN report indicates
that about 55 percent of the four to five million Filipinos working abroad are
women. </tt><p>

some estimates, if all the overseas workers stayed at home, unemployment would
be 11 or 12 percent. </tt><p>

Calls for Limits on Foreign Workers</a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Council for Economic Planning and Development called for a limit on the
number of foreign laborers in Taiwan.  The CEPD reported that imported labor is
one of the main factors behind the increasing unemployment in the manufacturing
and construction sectors.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics reported that
unemployment was 2.25 percent in March, the highest rate in nine years.</tt><p>
<tt>The CEPD believes that there are signs that foreign workers are replacing
natives in the labor market.  Growing unemployment, the council reports, is
closely related to the increasing numbers of foreign workers on the island.  A
CEPD official notes that the number of foreign workers has increased sharply
since the beginning of the second half of 1995; at the same time, the
unemployment rate has grown significantly.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 29, a Council of Labor Affairs panel concluded that the ceiling for
foreign workers should be cut from the current 65 percent of a company's work
force to 50 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>The Council of Labor Affairs is also planning to raise the vocational
stabilization fee that Taiwanese employers of foreign workers are charged.  The
vocational stabilization fund was set up in August 1992 to raise money to help
unemployed Taiwan workers, and to narrow the wage gap between local and foreign
workers. </tt><p>
<tt>One manufacturing representative proposed that the government set up a
special zone where only foreign workers would be hired in order to alleviate
labor shortages.  He reported that about 30,000 Taiwan companies have set up
operations on the Chinese mainland to take advantage of the lower labor and
land costs there.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 78,000 Taiwanese emigrated in 1995, versus 42,000 in 1994, mostly to
the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.</tt><p>

Has Skilled Labor Shortage</a></a></a></a></a>s
</a></h2>
<tt>One electronics industry estimate predicts that an additional 50,000
qualified engineers will be needed by 2000 in order to sustain the country's
industrial growth rate.  The skills shortage is expected to increase labor
costs. </tt><p>
<tt>The government argues that foreign companies are exaggerating the labor
shortage to persuade the government to allow more foreigners into the country.
The government adds that it is ready to admit foreigners to fill highly skilled
jobs, such as running wafer fabrication plants, but it is against any wider
relaxation of controls over foreign workers.  Some foreign managers complain
that, unless the labor shortages abate, their expansion will slow. </tt><p>
<tt>Nearly 650 Indonesian illegal immigrants detained in a Malaysian camp ended
a 28-hour hunger strike on June 19.  The Indonesians were protesting what they
called a "forced overstay" by the Malaysian authorities.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 3,000 Filipinos are currently in Malaysian jails for illegally
entering the country.  Immigration officials, and the Philippine military,
which has a joint border patrol agreement with Malaysia, said that up to 100
Filipinos enter Malaysia's eastern provinces each day.  According to the
Malaysian Foreign Affairs Department, there are about 80,000 Filipino nationals
in Malaysia, 90 percent of whom are Muslim Filipinos. </tt><p>
<tt>Spot checks of night market traders will be conducted in the state of
Selangar in order to reduce the number of illegal immigrants.  The Malaysian
government has found that a large number of illegal immigrants are conducting
business at night markets in Gombak, Jajang and Bangi.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC22">Australia</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>n
Government Reacts to Immigration Poll</a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On June 17, the Australian government announced that it will cut the intake
of refugees and humanitarian migrants from 15,000 to 12,000 in 1997, but
maintain overall immigration at 98,000.  The government will increase the
number of people accepted under family reunification and skilled categories by
3,000.  </tt><p>
<tt>The announcement follows the leaking of a confidential Cabinet report that
the government was considering cutting the humanitarian and refugee to 10,000.
</tt><p>
<tt>In June 16 by-elections in Australia's Blaxland, two anti-immigration
candidates garnered 22 percent of the vote, up from the 2.5 percent showing in
the federal elections just three months ago.  A report in the Sydney Morning
Herald says that the vote was not so much anti-immigrant, but an indication
that the Liberals and the Democrats decided not to contest the election.
</tt><p>
<tt>The report concludes that immigration is not a burning issue in the
country.  Other immigration critics say the results show that the major
political parties are out of step with public opinion on immigration. </tt><p>
<tt>According to the results of a Herald-AGB poll released on June 19,
Australians think their country is accepting too many immigrants, especially
from Asia.  About 65 percent of 2,063 people polled thought that immigration
was too high; three percent favored more immigration.  Some 88 percent said
there were too many Asian immigrants.  About 25 percent of immigrants come from
Asia.</tt><p>
<tt>A government official said that the poll accurately reflects the need to
improve the balance between the skills program and family reunification.</tt><p>
<tt>According to unpublished government estimates, the number of immigrants
entering Australia under the family reunification program is expected to jump
to 58,000 in 1996, up from 44,500 in 1995.  Much of this increase reflects the
surge in spouse or parent sponsorship by former Chinese students who
participated in the Tiananmen Square demonstrations.  About 37,000 students
were granted permanent residency in Australia.  </tt><p>
<tt>A recent report by Bureau of Immigration, Multicultural and Population
Research shows that 50 percent of all arrivals to New South Wales come from
Asia, primarily Southeast Asia.  New South Wales is the most populous
Australian state, home to 33 percent of Australians.  In 1992, New South Wales
attracted 43 percent of Australia's immigrants. </tt><p>
<tt>The number of Singaporeans in Australia doubled from 3,176 in 1976 to 6,397
in 1992, and the number of Malaysian immigrants increased ninefold, from 9,179
in 1966 to 84,000 in 1992.  Nearly 80 percent of the Malaysia immigrants are
ethnic Chinese.  Singaporeans and Malaysians typically enter the medical,
dental, architectural and engineering professions.  </tt><p>
<tt>The largest group of Asian immigrants are from Vietnam.  Most immigrants
from Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia arrive as professionals or under
business immigration programs.  Most Vietnamese came as refugees, and are
credited with bringing Buddhism to Australia.  The Vietnamese and Chinese
migrants are in the lower socio-economic groups, and tend to cluster in
inner-city areas. </tt><p>
<tt>A report by Monash University found that an Australian government proposal
to block migrants from receiving welfare benefits for two years would reduce
short-term costs, but not prevent a long-term welfare problem.  The government
has proposed extending its six-month waiting period for immigrants to receive
welfare benefits.  Under the proposal, those entering under the refugee and
humanitarian program would still receive immediate access to benefits. </tt><p>
<tt>The report found that one-third of the recently arrived immigrants depend
on welfare payments after entering the country, and at lease 25 percent
continue to depend on welfare during their second year in the country. </tt><p>
<tt>The Australian government is trying to pass new laws to stop the Human
Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission from telling detained illegal
immigrants about their rights.  Currently, the HREOC delivers sealed envelopes
to detained illegal immigrants spelling out their rights, including the right
to request an attorney.  By law, illegal immigrants can gain access to a lawyer
only if they make a specific request.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC23">Immigration
Affects New Zealand Election</a></a></a></a></a>s
</a></h2>
<tt>Polls suggest that New Zealand might elect a part-native Maori, Winston
Peters, as an anti-Asian prime minister, and give a significant number of seats
to the three-year old New Zealand First (NZF) party on October 12, 1996.  A
June 1996 poll found that the ruling National Party had 43 percent support
among voters, NZF 25 percent and Labour 16 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Saying that "New Zealand should be for New Zealanders," Peters has called
for an immigration moratorium and limits on foreign investment.</tt><p>
<tt>New Zealand, which rarely receives international news coverage, finds
itself in the news because of the rise of the New Zealand First party's
immigration policies.  The Wall Street Journal, which has carried many
complimentary stories about the country's fee-market economic policies,
recently described New Zealand in an editorial as "the modern face of
anti-immigration discrimination." </tt><p>
<tt>The number of people applying to migrate to New Zealand fell dramatically
after the government changed immigration policies in October, 1995.  There were
only 11 applications in the business investor category between January and May,
1996, a 96 percent fall from the 330 business investor applicants for the same
period last year.  New business investment residents brought $394 million to
New Zealand in 1995, 82 percent was from North Asians.  The minimum investment
was raised to $750,000 last year, and with only 11 applicants, the total
amounts to only $8.2 million.  </tt><p>
<tt>New Zealand officials attribute some of the decline in business immigrant
applications to recent anti-immigrant comments by political candidates and new
regulations which require an applicant to own more than 25 percent of the
enterprise and pass an English language test. </tt><p>
<tt>Applicants in the general skills category were down 70 percent to 2,403 in
the first five months of 1996, versus 8,093 applicants in the same period of
1995.  The number of general immigration applications is increasing
month-by-month, with 306 in January 1996 to 642 in May.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC2">Congress</a>:
Immigration</a><a></a>,
Welfare, Minimum
Wages</a></a</a></h2>
<tt><u>Immigration.</u>  In July, Republicans continued to debate among
themselves whether to try to include the Gallegly amendment in pending
legislation aimed at reducing illegal immigration.  It would give states the
right to prevent illegal alien children from enrolling in K-12 schools; Bob
Dole supports the Gallegly amendment, while President Clinton opposes
it.</tt><p>
<tt>After the two Republican Senators from Texas expressed opposition to the
Gallegly amendment, House Speaker Newt Gingrich asserted that "Until we
effectively control illegal immigration, every state should have the right to
decide whether its limited budget should be spent to provide benefits to
illegal aliens."  </tt><p>
<tt>Colin Powell also opposed the Gallegly amendment, calling it a
"shortsighted" way of dealing with illegal immigration.  One of the California
author's of Prop 187, Ron Prince, came out against the Gallegly amendment,
arguing that its inclusion was really a ploy to prevent any immigration
legislation from passing.</tt><p>
<tt>As of mid-July, the House had not yet named its conferees to the committee
that will reconcile the House and Senate versions of immigration reform
legislation.  Once named, the conference committee has 20 legislative days to
reconcile the two bills.  It is possible that the House conferees will not be
named until Congress returns from its summer recess in September.</tt><p>
<tt>The House voted 338-87 in favor of the immigration bill on March 21, 1996,
and the Senate approved a similar bill by a vote of 97-3 on May 2, 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration is an issue on which Dole and Clinton differ sharply.  Dole
supported Proposition 187 in California, while Clinton opposed it.  In
California in June, 1996, Dole said "When I am president, there are going to be
two wars declared: a war on illegal  immigration and a war on drugs."</tt><p>
<tt>The Republican National Committee reportedly spent $1.5 million on ads in
19 states that asserted that there are five million illegal immigrants in the
US, and then attacked President Clinton for "giving benefits to illegals."  The
Democratic National Committee countered with ads that asserted that "President
Clinton increased border patrols 40 percent to catch illegal
immigrants."</tt><p>
<tt>In a New York Times Op-ed on July 11, California Governor Pete Wilson
argued against the 1982 Supreme Court decision, Plyler v Doe, that requires the
states to give public school education to all resident children regardless of
their immigration status.  He said Plyler v Doe was an "unfunded federal
mandate" and should be removed.  Economist George Borjas countered on the same
page that the best way to deter illegal immigration would be to enforce
employer sanctions, even if that meant the introduction of a national employee
verification system.</tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 700,000 illegal alien children in K-12 US schools,
including 355,000 in California--California spends $1.8 billion annually for
the schooling of illegal alien children.</tt><p>
<tt>Some teacher groups pledged not to enforce the law if it is approved,
though school administrators, not teachers, enroll pupils in most US
schools.</tt><p>
<tt>A Gannett News Service poll of 1,027 adults throughout the US on June
20-25, 1996 reported that 63 percent of those polled thought all children
should be able to attend school.  At the same time, the poll found that 71
percent of the respondents believed immigrants got too many public benefits
such as welfare, medical care, and food stamps, even though 83 percent said new
immigrants are very hard-working.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 58 percent of respondents believed new immigrants take jobs from
American workers, and 59 percent thought they drive down wages.  Most of those
polled agreed that new immigrants start businesses that help the economy, and
almost half agreed the newcomers bring needed skills to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>A Los Angeles Times poll of Orange County Republicans found that 45 percent
favored building a wall along the United States and Mexican border--35 percent
of all US residents in this survey favored building such a wall.  Minorities
are 35 percent of Orange county's 2.4 million residents, but they are only 19
percent of the county's registered voters.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Orange County Republican Party paid part of a settlement of $400,000 to
resolve a lawsuit over a 1988 incident in which the party hired uniformed
security guards to police voting places in heavily Latino precincts in Santa
Ana.</tt><p>
<tt>Other issues took a distant second place to the Gallegly amendment.  Some
advocates took aim at the provision in the House bill that would require US
residents sponsoring the immigration of their relatives to have incomes that
were at least double the poverty line income for the residents and their
relatives--the Senate has a 125 percent of the poverty line requirement, up
from the current 100 percent rule.  </tt><p>
<tt>There were also calls to relax provisions in the new anti-terrorism law
approved March 1996 that would adversely affect asylees.  In signing the
Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act in April, 1996, the anniversary
of the Oklahoma City bombing, President Clinton said that "this bill also makes
a number of major ill-advised changes in our immigration laws having nothing to
do with fighting terrorism," and Clinton urged Congress to make revisions.
</tt><p>
<tt>The anti-terrorism law is being used to detain without bail aliens living
in the US who were convicted of crimes committed in the US.  Many immigrants
are caught when they return to the US from trips abroad as when, for example,
an INS inspector comes upon data in the computer that show that a permanent
resident returning to the US from abroad was convicted of drug possession 20
years earlier.  </tt><p>
<tt>Since the anti-terrorism law eliminates waivers of deportation for criminal
aliens, even permanent residents married to US citizens and who have US-born
children can be detained and deported.   The law does not distinguish between
crimes committed long ago and those committed recently.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS has asked for more flexibility in dealing with such cases; under
the current law, it cannot stop deportation proceedings.  Since 1993, the INS
has deported 140,000 foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>In presidential politics, former Colorado Governor Richard Lamm announced
on July 9 that he would seek to be the presidential nominee of Ross Perot's
Reform party.  Lamm has been an outspoken advocate of stricter limits on
immigration to the US; he has proposed reducing the number of legal immigrants
by half, and doing more to stop illegal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>The American Friends Service Committee in San Diego is urging Mexican
shoppers to boycott San Diego-area stores the weekend before the August 12-16
Republican National Convention in the city to dramatize the Mexican community's
displeasure with immigration reforms pending in Congress.</tt><p>
<tt>The House Appropriations Committee July 11 approved a $3.1 billion for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, and increase of $531 million over
FY96.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 25,000 Americans of mixed race demonstrated in Washington on July 20
in favor of a "multiracial" category on the 2000 Census.  Most minority groups
oppose permitting e.g. the child of a Latino and a White to describe themselves
as "multiracial," in part for fear that the undercount of minorities in the
census would increase.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Welfare Reform.</u> On July 18, the House approved by a 256-170 vote a
welfare reform bill that would give states lump sum federal payments that they
could use to assist poor people as they thought best.  The head of every family
receiving cash assistance would have to work within two years or the family
would lose assistance.</tt><p>
<tt>States would have to require welfare recipients to work to obtain full
federal payments, and able-bodied adults would have to work at least 20 hours
each week if they want to receive Food Stamps for more than three
months.</tt><p>
<tt>The House bill puts a five-year "lifetime" limit on any family receiving
cash assistance, and permits states to have shorter limits.</tt><p>
<tt>The House bill is expected to save $10 billion per year-- one-third of the
savings come from denying food stamps and other benefits to current and future
legal immigrants--about one million immigrants would lose Food Stamps.  </tt><p>
<tt>Another 500,000 legal immigrants who have not become US citizens and are
currently receiving payments would be cut from the Supplemental Security Income
program; half of those eliminated from the SSI program have been in the US for
10 or more years.  </tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants would be barred from Medicaid until they became US citizens, and
almost all social service programs would have to verify the immigration status
of applicants for benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>The Senate on July 19 refused to permit legal immigrants receiving SSI
payments to stay on the rolls under its bill.  By a vote of 62-34, the Senate
rejected a proposal by Senator Bob Graham (D-FL) to allow legal immigrants now
receiving welfare, food stamps, Medicaid and other benefits to continue
receiving them under the same conditions as US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>House Speaker Newt Gingrich emphasized that "Welfare reform must include a
general ban on welfare benefits for noncitizens."  President Clinton favors
restricting the access of immigrants to welfare by requiring US residents who
sponsor immigrants to live up to their sponsorship agreements, not having a
blanket bar to their participation written into law.</tt><p>
<tt>If approved, the ban on welfare for legal immigrants will affect California
and other immigrant states most.  For example, about 52 percent of the legal
immigrants receiving SSI payments are in California.  California counties are
currently required by state law to provide cash aid and health care to the
indigent, so if poor immigrants were removed from federal welfare programs,
California state and local governments may have to pick up the tab.</tt><p>
<tt>About 12.8 million people in 1995 received $22 billion in cash benefits
through Aid to Families With Dependent Children --two-thirds are children.  The
other two major programs targeted for reform are Food Stamps, which spent $29
billion to provide food coupons to 26 million people, and Supplemental Security
Income, which served 6.5 million people at a cost of $26 billion in 1995.
Since a disproportionately large number of the children of recent immigrants
come from poor families, the cuts will affect them more severely than the
children of the established American population.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under the Republican plan, there would be a five-year limit on welfare for
any family, and states could set shorter eligibility periods.  On July 16,
President Clinton pledged to require welfare recipients to work after two years
of aid, with or without new welfare legislation.</tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton vetoed Republican proposals to reform welfare programs as
part of the budget reconciliation process on December 6, 1995, and as a stand
alone reform on January 9, 1996.  Republicans agreed to consider welfare and
Medicaid changes separately, as President Clinton demanded, making it likely
that the welfare bill will be signed into law.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Minimum Wages</u>.  On July 9, the US Senate approved by a vote of 74 to
24 an increase in the minimum wage of $0.90 to $5.15 per hour by July 1, 1997.
The minimum wage would rise to $4.75 30 days after the bill is signed, and
employers would be able to pay teenagers the $4.25 hourly wage for the first 90
days of their employment.  Republicans attempted and failed to keep the minimum
wage at $4.25 for the employees of companies that have less than $500,000 per
year in sales.</tt><p>
<tt>The House approved a similar bill by a vote of 281 to 144 in May 1996, and
the House and Senate must work out differences between their bills before
President Clinton signs the wage increase into law.  </tt><p>
<tt>At $4.25 per hour, a full-time 2000 hour per year worker earns $8500; at
$5.15, annual earnings are $10,300.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, about 3.7 million US workers 16 or older were paid $4.25 or less
per hour; they represented about 5.3 percent of all hourly paid workers.  Teens
aged 16 to 19 are about one-third of those paid $4.25 or less; about 73 percent
of all minimum wage workers are white.</tt><p>
<tt>When the minimum wage was last raised, from $3.35 to $3.80 in April 1990,
and to $4.25 in April 1991, the percentage of teenagers who were employed fell
from 47 percent in March 1990 to 40 percent in June 1992--about 43 percent of
US teens were employed in mid-1996.  However, it is not clear how much
decreased teen employment is due to the higher minimum wage, and how much was
due to the July 1990-March 1991 recession.</tt><p>
<tt>The hike in the minimum wage is expected to offset at least partially the
wage depression in US labor markets due to the influx of unskilled immigrants.
Harvard economist Jeffrey Williams concluded that, between 1870 and 1910,
immigration reduced the real wages of unskilled US workers by 10 percent.  The
movement of so many workers from southern and eastern Europe to the US also
reduced global inequality.  Williams believes that immigration since 1980 plays
a "significant role" in rising inequality in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>George Borjas agrees that immigration reduces real wages and increases
inequality.  According to Borjas, 20 to 30 percent of the drop in the real
wages of unskilled workers is due to immigration.  David Jaeger of the Bureau
of Labor Statistics concludes that immigration is responsible for as much as
half of the real wage decline of high school dropouts in the US labor
force.</tt><p>
<tt>A Wall Street Journal analysis of DOL investigations of US firms found that
many construction and apparel firms unlawfully refuse to pay their employees
overtime wages.  One employer group estimates that US workers are unlawfully
denied $19 billion per year in overtime pay.</tt><p>
<tt>DOL's 800 inspectors open 20,000 investigations each year, mostly following
complaints, and wins settlements for workers in about 90 percent of the cases.
The largest overtime law violator in recent history was the Food Lion grocery
store chain, which agreed in 1993 to pay $11 million to 21,600 workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Federal law requires that workers employed more than eight hours daily or
40 hours weekly be paid 1.5 times their normal wage--DOL estimates that
two-thirds of US workers are covered by these overtime rules.  But salaried
employees--defined as persons who do not receive hourly pay--who work
"independently" are exempt from overtime rules, which leads to confusion--some
courts have held that newspaper reporters are exempt, while others have ruled
that, because the reporters follow editor's instructions, they are covered by
overtime laws.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 16, DOL held a Fashion Industry Forum on sweatshops in the US in
which mostly immigrant women sew garments.  Earlier, the House by voice vote
transferred $5 million from the Job Training Partnership Act to DOL's Wage and
Hour Division's garment industry sweatshop enforcement efforts.</tt><p>
<tt>The General Accounting Office, in a 1984 report, defined a sweatshop as "an
employer that violates more than one federal or state labor law governing
minimum wage and overtime, child labor, industrial homework, occupational
safety and health, workers' compensation, or industry registration."</tt><p>
<tt>DOL Secretary Reich asserted that two factors are promoting sweatshops in
the US--the increased concentration in the retail apparel and accessory
stores--the 20 largest firms in 1992 accounted for more than 41 percent of
retail sales in all apparel and accessory stores--and the fact that the higher
fashion end of the industry that depends on changes in styles is increasingly
returning to the United States.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 853,000 workers employed in the US apparel manufacturing
industry in May 1996, down almost 50 percent from the peak 1.45 million in
1973.  About 70 percent of US apparel workers are women, and their average
earnings of $7.94 are well under the average hourly manufacturing wage of
$12.71.</tt><p>
<tt>More than half of the 22,000 registered sewing shops in the US are believed
to be pay their workers below the minimum wage or violate federal overtime
regulations.  A DOL survey of apparel manufacturers in Southern California in
1996 found that 43 percent of sampled firms had failed to pay some of their
workers the minimum wage, 55 percent of firms had overtime liabilities, and one
third were not registered--as required--with the state of California.</tt><p>
<tt>Most garments are sewn in what is known as the "progressive bundle system,"
in which each worker specializes in a few of the 20 to 40 operations involved
in making a garment.  The bundle system involves large inventories, so that
there is work available for workers, and it is slow to respond to fashion
changes.  The alternative is a modular or team based system in which groups of
workers assemble a garment, with each worker performing multiple tasks.</tt><p>
<tt>WalMart, the US retailer originally charged with using children in Honduras
to sew "Kathie Lee Gifford" clothes, promised to use an independent inspector
to ensure that its US sewing shops abide by US labor laws.</tt><p>
<tt>The sweatshop controversy was set off in May, when a 15-year old Honduran
woman testified that she worked 74 hours weekly for $0.31 per hour to sew
"Kathie Lee Collection" clothes for Wal Mart.  WalMart stopped buying garments
from the Korean-owned company in Honduras, throwing many of the 600 women
employed there out of work. The Honduran Maquiladora Association says its
member firms have stopped hiring workers under 16. Kathie Lee reportedly
received $7 million from WalMart.</tt><p>
<tt>Interviews with women employed in maquiladoras in San Pedro Sula, Honduras,
one of whom made the original allegations against talk show host Kathie Lee
Gifford in May 1996, suggest that the women who work in the maquiladoras are
much better off than those who do not work in them, even at wages of $0.35 per
hour, helping to explain why so many women and girls are lined up waiting for
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Honduras is a country of six million with a per capita income of about $600
per year.  Unemployment and under employment are 30 to 50 percent.  About 20
percent of the 75,000 garment workers employed in 160 garment shops in Honduras
are unionized.</tt><p>
<tt>Apparel-making is a $500 million per year business in Honduras.  Honduran
law permits 14 year olds to work up to six hours per day and 36 hours per
week.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 15, Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-NJ) introduced a bill that would
block the importation of goods made with child labor.  The legislation, if
approved, would require the US government to identify countries that do not
prohibit child labor, or that have child labor laws but do not enforce them,
and the industries in which child labor is used.  To enforce this proposed law,
manufacturers could earn an international label that asserts that children were
not used in the manufacture of a product.</tt><p>
<tt>The ILO estimates that some 73 million children between the ages of 10 to
14 are employed worldwide.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">INS:
 Enforcement, Asylum,</a> and
Naturalization</a></></a></h2>
<tt><u>Enforcement</u>.  Beginning in 1993, the INS implemented a "prevention
through deterrence" strategy along the US-Mexican border, seeking to discourage
illegal immigrants from entering the US rather than apprehending them after
they crossed the border.  This strategy called for fences, lights, and more
agents visible on the border.</tt><p>
<tt>In October 1994, the INS launched Operation Gatekeeper along the US-Mexican
border south of San Diego, doubling the number of agents along 14 miles of
border, and arraying them in three tiers to make it harder for aliens to elude
apprehension.  After 20 months, the INS is apprehending about the same total
number of illegal aliens in the San Diego sector.  However, in the westernmost
Imperial Beach sector of the border, where Gatekeeper was concentrated,
apprehensions in the first nine months of the fiscal year fell sharply, from
138,000 in 1994 to 84,000 in 1995 to 60,000 in 1996.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the eastern sector of San Diego county, apprehensions rose from 1,785 in
the first nine months of FY94 to 21,000 in 1995 to 60,000 in 1996.  The INS
argued that this eastward shift in apprehensions proved that Gatekeeper is
working--according to the INS, aliens are easier to apprehend in the east.  By
one estimate, an alien could slip into a US house or car within 20 minutes of
crossing the border in the westernmost section of the border, while at least 12
hours is required further east.</tt><p>
<tt>However, several Border Patrol agents in San Diego complained that their
supervisors encouraged them to under-report apprehensions along the westernmost
part of the US-Mexican border, and to over-report apprehensions further east,
in an effort to show that Operation Gatekeeper was pushing illegal aliens
attempting entry further east.  Aliens were reportedly bussed east to be
processed, and then returned across the border where they would attempt
re-entry, increasing reported apprehensions. </tt><p>
<tt>In some cases, Border Patrol supervisors allegedly returned aliens to
Mexico without processing them and removed or shut off buried sensors along
popular  illegal immigration routes on the westernmost stretch of the
border.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 1, 1996, the INS began an investigation into the charges that the
apprehension data were manipulated.</tt><p>
<tt>As a result of a US-Mexican agreement, Mexicans from the interior of Mexico
who are apprehended in the US can volunteer to be flown home at US expense.
Reporters who accompanied a group of Mexicans flown from San Diego to
Guadalajara and given bus tickets to their home villages, report that the
Mexicans had tried at least three or four times to enter the US illegally
before consenting to go all the way home.  </tt><p>
<tt>One farm worker from Autlan, an area where half of the men usually migrate
to the US, expressed surprise at how difficult Operation Gatekeeper has made
illegal entry to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS extended its Employment Verification Pilot to San Diego in July
1996.  Under the EVP system, after an acknowledged immigrant is hired, the
employer submits his A-number to INS computers, which return an "authorized" or
"not authorized" message.  Workers who are "not authorized" are asked to
contact the INS to verify their status.  </tt><p>
<tt>During a seven-month trial of the EVP system in 1995 by 234 employers in
Los Angeles and Santa Ana, nearly 3,000 false immigration documents were
detected among 11,400 new hires.  The EVP system screens only those who
acknowledge that they are foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>Atlanta in Summer 1996 became a mecca for unauthorized immigrants as well
as Olympic athletes and fans.  Unauthorized immigrants are particularly drawn
to construction and service jobs in the area.  INS inspectors have received
many tips from US construction workers in the area identifying places that
unauthorized workers are employed.  The INS has a total of 54 inspectors in
Alabama, Georgia, and North and South Carolina.</tt><p>
<tt>One unauthorized Mexican worker, detained at a Veteran's Administration
hospital asbestos removal job, expected to work 70 hours each week and send
$500 weekly to his family in Mexico.  The unauthorized workers who were
detained reported that their employers "knew" that they had presented false
documents to get their jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>There was considerable speculation about whether and how many Cuban
athletes might defect during the Olympics, especially after two of Cuba's top
boxers defected from their team in Mexico in June 1996.  A US-born
Cuban-American agent predicted that many members of Cuba's national baseball
team would defect.  There are 10,000 athletes from 197 nations in Atlanta for
the Olympics.</tt><p>
<tt>Asian and Latino immigrants have begun to change the northern suburbs of
Atlanta, with Asian restaurants in Chamblee, and a requirement in Smyrna, with
5,000 Latino residents, that all public signs must be in English.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS continued to be criticized for "deceiving" a seven-member
Congressional delegation visiting Miami June 10, 1995.  According to the
Inspector General's report, INS officials moved detained aliens out of
overcrowded facilities, and authorized overtime at Miami airport, to cause the
visiting Congressional delegation to believe that there was little overcrowding
or delays.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS union complained after the visit that the Congressmen had obtained
a distorted picture, and INS  officials initially tried to cover up the
deception.  The Inspector General was able to re-create erased email messages
that detailed the deception and cover-up.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS has 33 district offices around the country.  The quality of the
services they provide to often anxious immigrants varies considerably.
Foreigners in the US wanting to change their temporary permission to permanent
residence or otherwise revise their status must be interviewed at one of these
offices.  INS district offices also administer examinations for naturalization
and arrange naturalization ceremonies.</tt><p>
<tt>The 33 district directors have different priorities and philosophies, so
that some use their resources to reduce waiting times for those seeking green
cards, while others concentrate on other issues.  In the Washington DC area,
the differences between the DC and Baltimore offices are such that some lawyers
advise their clients to move to Maryland so that they can deal with the
Baltimore office.</tt><p>
<tt>The districts also differ in their philosophy toward asylum seekers--some
are reluctant to release asylum seekers who entered the US illegally or with
false documents.</tt><p>
<tt>In mid-June, ten illegal alien construction workers were detained by the
INS while working for a contractor at Anacostia Naval Station.  The contractor,
a Portuguese immigrant who won the contract under a government set aside
program, said that he had carefully checked what turned out to be fraudulent
documents submitted by the workers.</tt><p>
<tt>In suburban Chicago, the INS on June 25 raided the Palatine Park District
and detained 21 landscape workers in one of the rare inspections of local
government employees.  Since October 1, 1995, the INS in the Chicago area has
conducted 55 employer inspections, and detained 600 illegal Mexican
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Near Eagle Pass, Texas, Mexican drug smugglers are reportedly using illegal
aliens to attempt to carry 100 pounds of drugs each in backpacks into the US.
Nationally, the US seizes an estimated five percent of the total drug flow from
Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt>In southern Texas, midwives, known as partera, deliver many of the babies
born to poorer women in their homes, and then prepare birth certificates that
show the babies were born in the US.  In thousands of cases, midwives also sell
false birth certificates to the parents of children born in Mexico that assert
that a child was born in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>As a result of an INS investigation, several midwives have been arrested,
and Texas is considering tightening its regulations on the issuance of birth
certificates.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Illegal Immigration</u>.  In 1994, the INS estimated that in October
1992 there were 3.4 million aliens present in the US without documentation, and
that the number of illegal aliens settling in the US was increasing by about
300,000 per year.  Revised estimates suggest that the illegal alien population
was larger in October 1992--3.8 million, including 1.8 million in California,
up from an earlier estimate of 1.4 million--but that the rate of increase in
the illegal alien population was lower--250,000 per year throughout the US.
</tt><p>
<tt>The revised estimates suggest that the illegal alien population in the US
increases by about 1 million every four years and will reach 4.8 million in
October 1996.  Because of potential errors associated with such estimates,
another range is provided.  Thus, the unauthorized alien population of October
1996 is expected to be 4.1 to 4.9 million, within it the range for unauthorized
Mexicans is 2.2 to 2.7 million.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the revisions increase the estimated number of Mexicans who were
illegally present in the US in the late 1980s, including some who may have
entered in the hope that there would be another amnesty.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Asylum</u>.  In FY95, some 149,500 foreigners applied for asylum in the
US, up slightly from 146,400 applications in FY94.  In the first six months of
FY96, there were 90,700 asylum applications. These data include 147,400
applications filed under a court settlement for Central Americans, but not the
20,000 to 50,0000 applications filed each year by aliens seeking to avoid
deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>In July 1996, seven members of the family of the man convicted of
assassinating Mexican Presidential candidate Luis Colosio in Tijuana on March
23, 1994 was granted asylum in the US for fear that they would be persecuted by
the Mexican government in Mexico.  The seven illegally entered the US in 1994,
after the killing, and they are now eligible to apply for permanent resident
status in the US after a one-year wait.</tt><p>
<tt>An article in the Washington Post on July 7 compared two asylum cases:  a
Chinese man who used a false Japanese passport to enter the US, and sought
asylum because of China's one child policy, and that of a Togo woman who used a
false British passport to enter the US, and sought asylum because she feared
genital mutilation in her native Togo.  The writer noted that the Chinese man
was released and given a work permit (the INS now requires a 180-day wait
before issuing work permits to asylum seekers), while the Togo woman was placed
in detention.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS does not have data on the numbers of asylum applicants who are
detained and released, making it hard to detect patterns in detention and
release decisions.  The INS is attempting to develop guidelines to help its
officers decide which applicants for asylum should be detained.  Reportedly, 94
percent of the asylum seekers who were released at Kennedy and Miami airports
did not show up for their asylum hearings.</tt><p>
<tt>The US asylum system is criticized from many quarters.  Restrictionists
complain that undeserving migrants apply for asylum, and too many then receive
asylum.  They note that the prospect of forced abortion or sterilization in
China can be grounds for asylum, as well as the threat of forced female genital
mutilation in Africa.  </tt><p>
<tt>Such policies are easily abused.  An estimated 90 percent of the Chinese
applicants for asylum come from three counties in Fujian Province, where aliens
are coached in how to satisfy the US requirements for asylum.  A Chinese asylum
seeker, who was released after applying for asylum, admitted that he came to
the US for economic reasons rather than because of the one-child policy.  After
his release, he joined a gang that extorted money from other Chinese
immigrants, and was sentenced to 11 years in US prison.</tt><p>
<tt>Others critics of US asylum policy and practice, use the disparate INS
treatment of asylum seekers to argue that release or detention depends on the
individual judgments of mid-level INS officials rather than rational
standards.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS has space to hold 8,400 aliens in 13 centers around the US--four
are operated by private firms for the INS.  Most of those detained are
foreigners who arrive in the US and seek asylum with no papers or with false
documents.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS plans to reopen the Elizabeth, New Jersey detention facility that
was closed after 315 detained asylum seekers rioted to complain of harassment
and poor conditions on June 18, 1995.  The INS will now have a different
private firm operating the facility.  Some state and local jails are adding
capacity so that they can offer beds to the INS.  The York, Pennsylvania county
jail plans to add 500 beds to house foreigners for the $50 per day that the INS
pays private contractors.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Naturalization.</u> The INS continues to struggle with a record number
of applications for naturalization--there were 1,056,981 naturalization
applications in 1995, up from 592,000 in FY94.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS is expected to naturalize one million aliens in 1996, including
327,000 in southern California.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS has authorized six private firms to test immigrants wishing to
become US citizens in English, and it disqualified one of those firms, Spanish
Business Services based in Florida, after learning that the firm helps
immigrants to cheat on the test.  About 20 percent of the persons who become
naturalized US citizens take tests at private firms.</tt><p>
<tt>Latino activists are launching a nationwide effort, called Latino Vote USA,
to register one million new voters by November's general election.  About 85
percent of Latinos live in nine states that have 202 of the 270 electoral votes
needed to elect a President--Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois,
New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Texas.</tt><p>
<tt>There were about 27 million Hispanics in the US in 1995, including 17
million who are 18 or older.  In the 1992 election, an estimated 4.2 million of
the 5.1 million registered Hispanics voted, and 61 percent of the Hispanic vote
went to Clinton, 25 percent to Bush, and 14 percent to Perot.  In the 1994
election, only 3.3 million of 5.2 million registered Hispanic voters cast
ballots.</tt><p>

<tt>Naturalization is open to foreigners who have had the status of legal
resident in the US for at least five years, were physically present at least
2.5 of these years, are at least 18, and are of "good moral character."
Applying for naturalization costs $95.  The applicant must take a test to
demonstrate that he/she can read and write English, and must answer correctly
12 of 20 questions on US history and government (Questions include:  What is
the Bill of Rights? Which countries were US allies in World War II? What are
the colors in the US flag?  What is Congress?  What does July 4 celebrate?

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">Mexico</a>/US
</a>Immigration</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>It is often asserted that Mexico and the US have the largest wage gap
between contiguous countries, but the World Bank's World Development Report,
released in June 1996, shows Poland had a lower GNP per capita than Mexico in
1994, $2410 versus $4180, while Germany and the US each have per capita GNPs of
about $25,700.  This makes the Polish-German ratio 1 to 11, and the Mexico-US
ratio 1 to 6. (The Polish economy expanded by seven percent in 1995, while the
Mexican economy shrank by about seven percent).</tt><p>
<tt>The Czech and Slovak Republics were also poorer than Mexico, with per
capita GNPs of $3,200 and $2,250 in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany, however, permits Poles to enter Germany without visas, and has
several programs through which Poles can work legally in Germany.  The US
requires visas or shopping cards from Mexican visitors, and offers relatively
few temporary work visas.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany attempts to prevent illegal Polish immigration and employment with
a mandatory resident registration system, and extensive labor market controls
that bear equally on citizens and non-citizens.  The US, by contrast, puts most
of its enforcement efforts at the border rather than inside the US.</tt><p>
<tt>As Mexico moves closer to approving dual citizenship, US think tanks have
begun to study the effects of dual nationality on Mexican and other Latin
American immigrants.  According to the Tomas Rivera Center, there is no clear
relationship between dual citizenship and naturalization.  About 40 percent of
the immigrants in the US from Latin American countries that offer dual
citizenship have become naturalized US citizens, versus 36 percent of the
immigrants from Latin American countries that do not offer dual
citizenship.</tt><p>
<tt>Absentee voting rights are also not correlated with US naturalization
rates--about 36 percent of the Latin American immigrants from countries that
offer absentee voting are naturalized, versus 37 percent from countries without
absentee voting.</tt><p>
<tt>On March 28, 1996, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo said that Mexico
needed to distribute income more equally to address the growing gap between
rich and poor, and between the industrialized north and the rural south.
</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's income distribution became more unequal in the 1990s, and Mexico
has, according to the World Bank, the sixth most unequal income distribution in
the world outside Africa--the richest 10 percent of Mexican residents received
41 percent of national income in 1994, up from 34 percent in 1984.  Latin
American countries with more unequal income distributions include Brazil and
Panama, where the richest 10 percent of residents receive about half of the
national income.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Forbes, Mexico includes 15 of Latin America's 39 billionaires,
even though Mexican's are only 20 percent of the region's population.  Forbes
reports that there were 447 billionaires in 1995, including 149 in the US, 110
in Europe, and 41 in Japan.</tt><p>
<tt>The poorest 50 percent of Mexican residents receive only 16 percent of
national income, and the number of Mexicans living in extreme poverty has grown
to 22 million, an increase of 5 million since the peso devaluation in December
1994.  </tt><p>
<tt>Growing inequality is evident in market activity.  Sales of
Mexican-produced Volkswagen Beetles fell sharply in 1995, while Mercedes-Benz
sales are expected to rise 50 percent in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>In Mexico's San Quintin Valley, 130 miles south of Ensenada, some 500 to
800 of the 25,000 mostly migrant farm workers broke into businesses and
restaurants in Poblado Lazaro Cardenas for food when they were told that they
would not be paid for the third straight week.  Farmer Arturo Lomeli
Villalobos, one of about 50 large farmers in the area, said he was unable to
convert dollars into pesos fast enough to pay the workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the farm workers in the San Quintin Valley are Indians from
southern Mexico--Mixtecs, Zapotecs, Oaxacans and Triquis.  Most speak little or
no Spanish, and many work 12 to 15 hours a day for daily wages of 25 pesos or
$3.33.  The workers have been protesting low wages and poor housing for
years.</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexican economy is stabilizing--prices are expected to rise between 27
percent and 29 percent in 1996.  However, real wages in Mexico in 1996 are
below what they were in 1981, and the Mexicans doing best are those with ties
to the US economy, either via trade or migration.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1996, a procession of US fruit and vegetable growers have charged that
"unfair competition" from Mexico and Central America is hurting them.  First
came Florida tomato growers, then the California avocado industry and, in May
1996, California sugar pea growers complained that Guatemala, which produces an
estimated 70 percent of the world's snow peas and snap peas, have an unfair
advantage in lower labor costs and a climate that allows year-round sugar pea
production.</tt><p>
<tt>In both Florida and Mexico, tomatoes are picked by migrant Mexican workers.
Mixtec Indians from Oaxaca are prominent parts of the tomato work force in
Sinaloa and California, and Huichole Indians do much of the harvest work in
Mexico's Nayarit state.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 2, 1996, the International Trade Commission rejected 4-1 the
Florida growers petition under Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act.  The 201
petition sought relief from price-based import surges of tomatoes and peppers
from Mexico; if the ITC had agreed with Florida growers, President Clinton
could have imposed extra duties on Mexican tomatoes.</tt><p>
<tt>However, the International Trade Commission on May 16 voted to continue a
separate antidumping investigation on fresh tomatoes from Mexico, as requested
by Florida tomato growers.  The ITC found a "reasonable indication" that the US
industry is being materially injured by tomatoes from Mexico that were sold
below cost in the US. </tt><p>
<tt>A preliminary Commerce Department determination on dumping is expected in
early September, and a final decision on the antidumping petition is expected
in January 1997.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico produces about 45 percent of the world's avocados, some 800,000 tons
per year, but Mexican avocados have been banned from the US since 1914.  Some
100,000 workers are employed on 8000 avocado farms in Michocan, one the major
states of origin for Mexican migrants headed to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The ban on Mexican avocados is expected to be lifted in November 1996, but
California avocado growers are resisting a lifting of the ban, arguing that
more study is needed to ensure that imported Mexican avocados do not bring
pests with them. USDA regulations on avocado imports require that there be an
"absence of infestations of injurious insects known to attack fruits and
vegetables" in the area of origin of the fruit during the 12 months before
importation.</tt><p>
<tt>Under proposed USDA regulations, Mexican growers certified to ship avocados
to the US would have to be inspected in Mexico, and then USDA would also check
for pests in packing plants.  Mexican growers would pay for these USDA
inspections.  Mexican avocados could be sent to only to 19 Midwest and
Northeastern states during the months of November to February, when the cold
weather would prevent any of the pests from surviving.</tt><p>
<tt>Canadians pay $0.50 to $0.60 per Mexican avocado in retail stores, while US
consumers often pay $1 each for California avocados.  About five percent of
Mexico's fresh avocados are exported.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexicans consume about four times more fresh produce per capita than
Americans, in part because fewer Mexican have the freezers and microwaves
associated with frozen vegetables.</tt><p>
<tt>Because of drought, Mexico is expected to import about 12 million tons of
grain in 1996, one-third of Mexico's grain consumption.</tt><p>
<tt>During the first 10 months of 1995, Mexican agricultural exports to the
United States, excluding grains, rose by 42 percent to $ 2.9 billion, while US
agricultural exports to  Mexico fell 44 percent to $ 724 million.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, Mexico exported $69 billion worth of products to the US and
Canada--its NAFTA partners took 86 percent of Mexico's exports.  But one half
of Mexico's exports came from maquiladoras, and 70 percent of Mexico's exports
were shipped abroad by 300 companies.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico in mid-June began to distribute a 22-page pamphlet to Central
Americans attempting to enter Mexico illegally that outline their rights,
including their right not to be harassed by Mexican police seeking bribes.  The
pamphlet explains that it is illegal to enter Mexico without proper documents,
but then goes on to say that even illegal foreigners in Mexico have basic human
rights, such as the right to "respectful treatment," and provides telephone
numbers that migrants can call to report abuses. </tt><p>
<tt>The pamphlet advises migrants who suffer abuse to remember the color of the
uniform that the abuser wore, and the license plate number of the vehicle
used.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">Immigrant
Integration</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>In July 1997, several reports on the economic progress of recent Latino
immigrants were released, and all were pessimistic about upward mobility for
Latino immigrants with little education.</tt><p>
<tt>Many immigrants arrive in the US without English, and largely for that
reason they initially earn less than US-born residents who are similar to them
in years of schooling, age etc.  Barry Chiswick of the University of Illinois
at Chicago found, in studies completed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, that
immigrant men initially earned 10 percent less than similar US-born men.
However, the extra drive and ambition that prompts immigrants to migrate
enabled them to close the earnings gap after an average 13 years in the US, and
provided them with six percent higher earnings after 23 years in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>George Borjas argued that Chiswick was mixing together the characteristics
of the immigrants, and the general state of the economy.  In effect, Borjas
argued that Chiswick was generalizing from a unique set of
circumstances--highly skilled Asian immigrants who arrived during the 1950s and
1960s, when the US economy boomed.  </tt><p>
<tt>Borjas argued that immigrants arriving in the 1980s were more likely to be
refugees or unskilled workers who would not catch up in earnings to similar US
workers in a slow growing economy in which wages for unskilled workers were
falling.</tt><p>
<tt>Studies competed in the 1980s and 1990s show that both Chiswick and Borjas
are correct, each for some portion of the immigrant population.  For example, a
Rand Corporation study released in July 1996, "The Mixed Economic Progress of
Immigrants", reports that the median weekly earnings of immigrant men fell from
99 percent of those of native-born workers in 1970 to 89 percent in 1990,
supporting the conclusions of Borjas.  </tt><p>
<tt>However, immigrant men from China, Japan and Korea increased their earnings
relative to US born men between 1970 and 1990, jumping from average earnings
that were 88 percent as much as similar US born men earned in 1970, to 110
percent of the earnings of similar US born men in 1990, supporting
Chiswick.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexican immigrant men aged 25 to 34 lost ground relative to similar US-born
men over the past two decades.  Those arriving between 1965 and 1969 earned 63
percent as much as similar US-born men in 1970.  By 1990, the earnings of this
same group of immigrant men were only 57 percent as much as similar US-born
men.  </tt><p>
<tt>These data suggest that Mexican immigrants enter the US with education,
language, and skill disadvantages, and that these disadvantages persist and may
even widen over time.</tt><p>
<tt>One reason for the drop in relative wages is that many Mexicans are
unskilled, and the earnings of all unskilled workers in the US economy have
been falling.  The earnings of foreign-born men in the bottom tenth of the US
work force--when arrayed by earnings--have fallen to 63 percent of their US
counterparts' earnings from 94 percent in the 1970s and 1980s.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the Rand study, Mexican immigrants who arrived in the US in
the late 1970s typically earned about half as much as similar US-born
residents.  In 1990, they still earned only about half as much as similar
US-born residents.</tt><p>
<tt>The Rand study was based on data from the 1970, 1980, and 1990 Censuses, as
well as a 1980-86 survey of 10 and 12th graders.  The education data show that
80 percent of Asian high school graduates go on to college, versus 50 percent
of Hispanic high school graduates.  In California, about 25 percent of the 15
to 17 year olds born in Mexico were not enrolled in school in 1990, versus five
percent for other immigrant teens.  By the age of 15, many Mexican immigrants
have already been out of school for two years.</tt><p>
<tt>One critic of the Rand study argued that Latinos are rational when they do
not attend school, since the janitorial and service jobs open to them do not
require much education.  He argued instead for raising the minimum wage to
increase Latino earnings.</tt><p>
<tt>The US Department of Labor released its second analysis of data on the 1.6
million persons legalized under the 1987-88 program that permitted persons who
were illegally in the US since January 1, 1982 to become legal immigrants.
(The 1.1 million unauthorized aliens who became legal immigrants under the
Special Agricultural Worker or SAW program were generally much less educated,
and were not included in the DOL survey).</tt><p>
<tt>The report concludes that legalized aliens interviewed in 1992 "face
extraordinary obstacles to achieving the American Dream," in part linked to the
fact that, after ten years in the US, about 25 percent do not speak much
English.  Despite high labor force participation rates, relatively few of the
legalized aliens were able to move beyond the restaurant and construction jobs
they held as illegal aliens.</tt><p>
<tt>Legalized aliens were not eligible for most welfare programs for five
years, or until 1993.  However, when the survey was done in 1992, about 60
percent of the newly legalized sample families had assets of less than $1000,
which would qualify them for many benefit programs.  As the barriers to
benefits fall, the survey found that many of the newly-legalized are beginning
to apply for and receive benefits, although the proportion of the newly
legalized receiving benefits is lower than for similarly poor US-born
residents.</tt><p>
<tt>DOL surveyed 4,000 legalized aliens in 1989 and 1992, including 69 percent
from Mexico and 15 percent from Central American countries.  About 58 percent
of the pre-82 amnesty applicants lived in California, followed by 13 percent in
Texas, and seven percent in New York.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 40 percent of the legalized aliens reported that no one in their
family had private health insurance.  It found heavy usage of emergency,
maternal and child health-care programs, and reported that 25 percent of the
legalized families have a child in reduced-price school-lunch programs.</tt><p>
<tt>According to journalist Robert Samuelson, the US may be "importing poverty"
through immigration.  He estimates that 25 to 50 percent of the increase in US
poverty since 1970 may be due to immigration--six million of the 15 million
increase in the number of poor persons between 1973 and 1994 were Hispanic;
about 40 percent of the nine million increase between 1987 and 1994 in the
number of Americans without health insurance were Hispanic, and the proportion
of Hispanics among the poorest 20 percent of Americans rose from five percent
in 1974 to 12 percent in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Samuelson, immigration aggravated rather than caused these
socio-economic problems;  US "indicators of national well-being" are depressed
when poorly educated immigrants arrive.  They and their children may do better,
as past waves of immigrants have, but success is not guaranteed.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Brit</a>ain
Debates Asylum Change</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The British government has been trying to reduce the number of asylum
seekers, and to limit their access to social services while their applications
are pending.  Britain is the only European country in which asylum applications
are rising, to 44,000 in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>The government has attempted this by administrative and legislative means.
In January 1996, the British government introduced new rules that would make
immigrants who did not apply for asylum upon entry ineligible for welfare
benefits.  It estimates that such a rule would save at least US $410 million
per year by excluding from benefits those who did not apply immediately.  One
June 21, a British Court of Appeal struck down the rule in unusually fervent
language.</tt><p>
<tt>The government then resorted to legislative means, introducing amendments
to pending legislation to enact the one-day rule.  The House of Lords balked,
choosing instead to give applicants three days in which to apply, but on July
15, the House of Commons rejected the Lords' amendment and supported the
government's more restrictive requirement. </tt><p>
<tt>On July 15, the Archbishop of Canterbury asked the government not to
eliminate welfare benefits for asylum seekers whose applications are pending.
The Archbishop warned that the proposed statute would mean that many genuine
asylum seekers would suffer unwarranted hardship after losing benefits. </tt><p>
<tt>Several backbench Tory M.P.'s warned the government on July 11 that if it
did not restore the three-day application period for asylum seekers to obtain
welfare, they would vote against the Asylum and Immigration Bill when it comes
up for a final vote.  The House of Lords is expected to decide on July 22
whether to agree to the one-day limit, or fight further for a three-day
application period.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC8">German</a>
Immigration Reforms
Expected</a>/a></a></h2>
<tt><u>Immigration Policy</u>.  Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, Germany's
Commissioner for Foreigners, predicted on June 29 that Germany will soon make
reforms in immigration law.  Before the end of 1998, it will be easier for at
least the children of foreigners born in Germany to become dual nationals, she
said.  According to Schmalz-Jacobsen, most of Germany's 656 members of
Parliament are in favor of changing Germany's nationality laws to reduce the
waiting period before a foreigner can apply for naturalization, and to give
foreigners more rights in the naturalization process.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany's current nationality law, the 1913 Reichs- und
Staatsangehoerigkeitsgesetz, allows for the naturalization of foreigners.
There were about 200,000 naturalizations in 1993, and 260,000 in 1994.  Between
1973 and 1994, about 1.5 million foreigners became German citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>There are two major types of naturalization in Germany.  Ethnic Germans,
so-called "Aussiedler," are Germans abroad who move to Germany, where they have
a right (Anspruch) to German citizenship. There were 233,000 Anspruch
naturalizations in 1994, and 1.1 million since 1973.  The overwhelming number
of naturalizations in Germany are naturalizations of people of German
stock.</tt><p>
<tt>Other foreigners may become German citizens after residence of at least 15
years at the discretion (Ermessen) of the German authorities.  Such
naturalization applications may be rejected if the foreigner has committed a
felony (including prostitution), has less than six years of schooling, has
received welfare payments, or if German authorities deem naturalization to be
"not in the interest of the German state."  The fee for naturalization was
lowered in 1993 to DM500 per adult and DM100 per child.  Foreigners who marry
Germans can apply for naturalization after three years of marriage and
residence.</tt><p>
<tt>Since 1993, foreigners between the ages of 16 and 23, who have lived
legally for at least eight years in Germany, and who have at least six years of
German schooling, have been entitled to German citizenship upon request.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 45,000 such "Ermessen," or discretionary, naturalizations in
1993--more than double the 18,000 in 1989.  In 1994, the number of
discretionary naturalizations fell to 26,000.</tt><p>
<tt>In most cases, foreigners wishing to become naturalized German citizens
must give up their current citizenship.  Most West European nations
automatically release their citizens when they naturalize, but a few nations,
notable Turkey, require the completion of military service before a young man
can give up his citizenship.</tt><p>
<tt>In the 1990s, of the 450,000 marriages that have taken place each year in
Germany, 390,000 have been between two Germans, 10,000 between two foreigners
(with at least one partner living in Germany), and 50,000 of a German with a
foreigner.  In about 25,000 marriages each year, a German woman marries a
foreign man--Turks, ex-Yugoslavs, Italians, and Americans together comprise
almost half of the foreign husbands.  In another 25,000 marriages each year, a
German man marries a foreign woman--Poles, Thais, and ex-Yugoslavs together are
about one-third of the foreign wives.</tt><p>
<tt>The German weekly "Der Spiegel" in June summarized the work of several
German researchers under the headline "Germany needs foreigners."</tt><p>
<tt>The article opened by contradicting German political convention in
asserting that Germany is a country of immigration (Einwanderungsland), and
that it is time for Germany to recognize that fact by enacting an immigration
law, and creating an immigration department to administer the law.  The SPD,
FDP, and the Greens have made immigration proposals, although the SPD speaks of
Zuwanderung rather than using the common German word, Einwanderung, which has a
negative connotation for voters.</tt><p>
<tt>In each of the political parties' proposed immigration laws, a commission
would be charged with setting an annual ceiling on the number of newcomers to
be admitted to Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Many observers put the "immigration need" of Germany at 300,000 to 400,000
newcomers per year. According to a 1994 estimate, 1.1 million foreigners and
ethnic Germans entered Germany to settle, and 740,000 Germans and foreigners
left, leaving Germany with a net 330,000 newcomers--180,000 ethnic Germans, and
150,000 net new foreign residents.</tt><p>
<tt>Some politicians favor reducing the number of ethnic Germans to make room
for a larger number of other foreigners.  During the Spring 1996 elections in
southwestern Germany, SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine argued that the country could
not afford to accept 220,000 ethnic Germans each year.  The FDP has proposed
that the 218,000 ethnic Germans admitted in 1995 be reduced in future years by
about 10 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Several economists argue that Germany's economic miracle is linked its
immigrants, and that Germany needs more young and mobile foreigners to sustain
its welfare state.  One estimate is that, in 1992, foreigners and ethnic
Germans paid DM32 billion in taxes, and received DM18 billion in tax-supported
services (there are no data on ethnic Germans, since they enter statistical
systems as Germans).  Another study argued that two-thirds of all foreigners
who found jobs since 1988 took jobs that Germans refused.</tt><p>
<tt>In one proposed immigration system, employers would bid against one another
by offering a fee to the government to obtain one or more of a annual quota of
foreign professionals.  Successful bidders would then receive permission to
import the foreigners that they recruit.</tt><p>
<tt>Some demographers argue that Germany needs foreigners to keep the
population from shrinking, from 82 million in 1996 to a projected 73 million in
2020, and 39 million in 2050.  In order to keep the German labor force at its
current level of about 41 million, it is estimated that Germany will need to
accept an average 400,000 immigrants annually through the year 2000.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Aussiedler/Jews.</u>  Two groups have special privileges for settling in
Germany, ethnic Germans and Jews.  In 1939, an estimated 8.6 million ethnic
Germans lived outside the German Reich, mostly in Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union.  Today, an estimated three to 10 million remain, with most estimates in
the three to four million range.</tt><p>
<tt>Ethnic Germans (Aussiedler) living in the ex-USSR have the right to enter
Germany, but the burden of proof is on them to prove that they are in fact
descendants of Germans settlers.  Until 1990, ethnic Germans could move to
Germany and then prove that their ancestry allowed them to stay.  However, when
in 1990 almost 400,000 such people arrived, fears of a mass influx arose and
procedures were changed to require ethnic Germans to prove their ancestry
before emigrating, and the maximum number allowed to move to Germany was set at
220,000 per year.</tt><p>
<tt>Today, most Aussiedler are from Russian and Kazakstan.  They arrive in
Germany as Russian and Kazak citizens, and they are permitted to keep their
Russian and Kazak citizenship even after they become German citizens.  Some
have returned to Russia and Kazakhstan.</tt><p>
<tt>Since World War II, Germany has had a policy of accepting Jews from the
USSR/ex-USSR on the ground that the destruction of European Jewry by Germany
imposed a duty to take in Jews suffering discrimination.  Recently, Germany's
Development Minister suggested that Germany may no longer need to accept Jews
from the ex-USSR, since conditions there have improved for them.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some 45,000 Jews, and 1.5 million ethnic Germans, have migrated to Germany
since 1990.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Data on Foreigners</u>. There were about five million foreigners among
the 79 million residents of united Germany on October 3, 1990, and all but
100,000 of them were in what was West Germany.  Data on foreigners in Germany
has since 1959 come from a central register--Auslaenderzentralregister or
AZR--that collects data from the local authorities with whom residents register
when moving in or out of a city.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some foreigners are believed to have left Germany without de-registering,
so the seven million registered foreigners in the AZR in December 1995 may be
an overestimate by several hundred thousand.</tt><p>
<tt>About half of the foreigners in Germany in 1995 had lived in the country
for 10 years or more, and half of these had lived in Germany for 20 or more
years.  Some 2.5  million foreigners settled in Germany between 1988 and
1993.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreigners are about nine percent of Germany's residents, and their
proportion is rising, mainly through natural increase.  About 100,000 or 12
percent of the 800,000 births in Germany each year are "foreign
children."</tt><p>
<tt>Turks are the largest group of foreigners--the two million Turks are about
28 percent of all foreigners in Germany, followed by 1.3 million persons from
ex-Yugoslavia, 19 percent; 572,000 Italians, eight percent; 356,000 Greeks,
five percent; and 263,000 Poles, four percent.  About one-fourth of the
foreigners in Germany come from one of the other 14 EU member nations.</tt><p>
<tt>There were two million asylum-related foreigners living in Germany in 1993,
and 1.75 million in 1994.  Of the asylum-related foreigners living in Germany
in 1994, only 267,000 were recognized refugees and their families.  Another
650,000 were "de facto" refugees, 415,000 had pending asylum applications, and
350,000 had a temporary safe-haven status in Germany, mostly because of trouble
at home.</tt><p>
<tt>About three-fourths of all foreigners lived in four of Germany's 16 states
in 1994.  North Rhine-Westphalia had 1.9 million foreign residents,
Baden-Wuerttemberg had 1.2 million, Bavaria had 1.1 million, and Hesse had
790,000 residents. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Bosnians</u>.  There are 320,000 Bosnians in Germany, 86,000 in Sweden,
80,000 in Austria, 36,000 in Italy, 28,000 in Denmark, 25,000 in Switzerland,
18,000 in Norway, and 15,000 in France.</tt><p>
<tt>Starting on October 1, 1996, Bosnians in Germany are supposed to return to
Bosnia, but it now appears that this will be difficult to accomplish.</tt><p>
<tt>First, the Dayton agreement says that Bosnians have the right to return to
their homes, but up to half of the Bosnians in Germany are Muslims from areas
now under Serbian control.  Second, the Bosnian government is demanding that
young men who avoided military service pay DM1,000 to DM10,000 in fines, which
may discourage returns.</tt><p>
<tt>Off-the-record, German officials complain that they do not want their
country to be forced into paying three times for Bosnia's civil war--first to
care for Bosnians in Germany, second in contributions to the EU-reconstruction
fund, and third in special payments to promote the return of Bosnians in
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Vietnamese</u>.  On July 5, Germany announced that Vietnam had approved
the return of 3,000 Vietnamese.  Germany submits the names of persons to be
returned, and Vietnam checks to be sure that they are Vietnamese.  There is not
yet a timetable for the repatriation process.</tt><p>
<tt>Meanwhile, an article in Reuters said that many illegal Vietnamese want to
leave the cigarette-selling underworld of Berlin to return home.  Some say they
fear arrest, others worry about the gangs that control the smuggling of
cigarettes. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Asylum.</u>  In June 1996, there were 8,234 asylum applications, the
smallest number since June 1989.  About seven percent of the applications
handled in June 1996 resulted in a foreigner receiving asylum in Germany, and
another five percent of the foreigners were allowed to stay temporarily in
Germany--88 percent of the applications were rejected.</tt><p>
<tt>In June 1996, it was reported that 74 of Germany's 31,500 Catholic and
Protestant churches had become sanctuaries for 230 foreigners, half children,
whom the government was seeking to deport.</tt><p>
<tt>In the "14 steps to the new asylum law," a leading journalist, Heribert
Prantl, reviews the history leading up to the narrowing of the right to asylum
in Germany.  Prantl began with Article 16 of the German Basic Law--persons who
are politically persecuted can obtain asylum--and then noted that, in the guest
worker era, there were few asylum applications--5,595 in 1973.  As the number
of asylum applicants climbed to 108,000 in 1980, there was talk of asylum
reform, but it was relatively easy to reduce the number of applicants by
requiring Turks, who were half of the applicants, to obtain visas before coming
to Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1990, there were 193,000 asylum applications, and Germans began to say
that Germany had too many problems to deal with the burdens of asylum seekers.
In 1991, attacks on foreigners began first at Hoyerswerda and Huenxe.  Those
who opposed changing the constitution in a manner that restricted asylum said
that Germany should not give in to anti-foreigner sentiment stimulated by the
radical right.</tt><p>
<tt>In the spring of 1991, the SPD proposed an immigration law with annual
quotas.</tt><p>
<tt>Because Social Democrats have an historically based interest and sympathy
for people in need of refuge, the SPD was slow to accept the need for a change
in the asylum law.  The ruling CDU-CSU-FDP coalition wanted to amend the
constitution, but the SPD argued that procedural changes could resolve the
issue.  In August 1992, foreigners were attacked in Rostock, and the SPD, in a
fall 1992 meeting, agreed that the constitution must be amended in a manner
that reduced the number of asylum applicants living in Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>On May 29, 1993, five Turks were killed in an arson attack on their home in
Solingen.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 26, 1993, the German Parliament approved the asylum reform by a vote
of 521 to 132--the individual right to asylum remained in the German Basic Law,
but access to asylum in Germany was limited by the "third safe country"
clause-- asylum applicants were expected to apply for asylum in the first safe
country they entered.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany is surrounded by safe countries.  Thus, the burden of proof is very
great for applicants from countries recognized as generally safe.  Airport
rules permit an accelerated hearing on applications from persons arriving
without documents at German airports.  If they fail the test, they can be sent
back immediately.</tt><p>
<tt>The new asylum law went into effect on July 1, 1993, and was approved by
the German constitutional court on May 14, 1996.  Germany spent a record DM15
billion on asylum seekers in 1992; in 1995, the cost of operating the asylum
system was about DM8 billion.</tt><p>
<tt>About 2.3 million of Germany's 36 million households received welfare
assistance at the end of 1994, including 450,000 foreigners.  The number of
foreigners receiving welfare payments dropped by 200,000 between 1993 and 1994
because of changes effective July 1, 1993 that prevented many asylum applicants
from receiving cash assistance.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Residence and Work Permits</u>.  All foreign residents need an
Aufenhaltsgenehmigung, or residence permit.  There are four major
types--Aufenthaltsbefugnis, or Duldung (toleration) to stay in Germany granted
for humanitarian reasons, a status that can be revoked at any time;
Aufenthaltsbewilligung, or the right to stay in Germany for a specific purpose,
such as to study; Aufenthaltserlaubnis, or permission to stay, usually for one
year; and, Aufenthaltsberechtigung, or permanent residence status.</tt><p>
<tt>Most foreigners must live in Germany one year before obtaining a work
permit, and most foreigners initially obtain one- to- three year work permits
(allgemeine Arbeitserlaubnis) after the local employment office certifies that
there are no unemployed local workers available to fill the job for which the
foreigner is seeking permission to fill.  </tt><p>
<tt>The work permits usually restrict a foreign worker to a specific job with a
named employer.  Other work permits restrict the localities, industries and
occupations in which the permit-holder may work.  Most foreigners must live in
Germany for at least eight years before they can be self-employed.</tt><p>
<tt>Work permits can also be unlimited, or "unbefristet," in time, which means
that the foreigner is allowed to work in Germany as long as she has a valid
residence permit, and special, or "sonder," which means that the foreigner can
work for any employer and in any job without the labor office first certifying
that unemployed workers are not already available.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, some 2.2 million foreign workers were employed and enrolled in the
German social security system, including 605,000 Turks, 420,000 from former
Yugoslavia, and 203,000 Italians.  Another 400,000 foreign workers were
unemployed, including 21 percent of the Turkish workers, and 18 percent of the
Italian workers.  Most of these employed foreign workers are employed in
manufacturing (884,000) or services (573,000). In 1994, an average 16 percent
of foreign workers were unemployed, versus nine percent of all workers in
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Labor Market.</u>  In mid-June, the German construction employers
association withdrew from the umbrella German employers' association to protest
the umbrella association's failure to approve a minimum wage for all workers on
construction sites in Germany.  The construction employers wanted the minimum
wage rule to discourage the employment of an estimated 150,000 cheaper British,
Irish, and Portuguese workers; the employers' association was afraid of setting
a precedent for an industry-wide minimum wage.</tt><p>
<tt>Many German construction firms have gone bankrupt, and more bankruptcies
are feared.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 200,000 non-German EU workers employed in the German
construction industry.  In a critical report, the German newspaper Der
Tagespiegel, on July 1 reported that many of the Poles working legally on
German construction sites under Werkvertraege (subcontracting arrangements
between German general contractors and foreign subcontractors) do not have
workers' compensation insurance--if they are injured on the job, they are
dismissed, so that they lose their right to work in Germany, and they wind up
being responsible for their hospital bills.</tt><p>
<tt>According to some Polish workers, contracts are signed in Poland just
before the workers' departure for Berlin, so that the workers are unaware of
their rights.  Many Werkvertrag workers are expected to work 60 hours per week;
hourly wages range from DM6 to 7, far less than the DM15.73 minimum for a West
German construction worker, and DM11.86 in the East, but far more than Polish
wages, which average about DM350 monthly or DM2 per hour.</tt><p>
<tt>According to worker advocates, if the foreign workers honestly report their
long hours and low wages during inspections, they are fired, and thus lose
their work permits.</tt><p>
<tt>About 22,000 Polish workers were working in mid-1996  under Werkvertraege,
half of them in construction.  There are another 7,000 Hungarian workers
employed in Germany under Werkvertraege, 5,900 Turks, 5,100 Croats, 4,200
Romanians, 2,900 Czechs, 1,700 Bulgarians, 1,600 Slovakians, and 1,000
Bosnians.  </tt><p>
<tt>The German union federation DGB estimates that, for every legal worker
employed under a Werkvertrag, there are another six to 10 illegal foreign
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>In addition, foreigners may enter Germany to work seasonally--defined as a
stay in Germany of up to 90 days.  Some 140,000 Polish seasonal workers were
employed in Germany in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 550,000 residents of the former East Germany commuted to jobs
in the former West Germany (340,000) or West Berlin (210,000) in November 1994,
down from 600,000 in November 1993, but still almost three times more than in
November 1990.  The commuting workers have average earnings of DM2,300 per
month, versus DM2,000 for non-commuters.  About 30 percent of the commuters
live in what was East Berlin. </tt><p>
<tt>There seems to be considerable movement into and out of commuter status. In
1994, 150,000 former East German residents stopped commuting, and 100,000 began
commuting.  About one in seven East German commuters is employed in West German
construction.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 1, 1996, 236,000 east German manufacturing workers began to receive
the same wages as their west German colleagues.  However, workers in the east
will continue to work 39 hours each week, four hours longer than in the
west.</tt><p>
<tt>A recent report from the Hessen state labor office indicates that most of
the jobs in the underground economy (Schwarzarbeit) are filled by German
citizens, not foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 2.6 million unregistered jobs in Germany.  Unions
blame high taxes and living costs for increased Schwarzarbeit.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Berlin</u>.  The 400,000 foreigners in Berlin are about 11 percent of
the city's 3.5 million residents.  The foreigners include 138,000 Turks, 70,000
persons from ex-Yugoslavia, 26,000 Poles, and 46,000 residents from other EU
countries.  Berlin has more foreigners than any other German city.</tt><p>
<tt>According to one projection, Berlin will grow slowly to 3.8 million
residents by the year 2010, but the number of foreigners will increase faster,
to 575,000, and amount to 15 percent of Berlin's population.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of Berlin's foreigners are in the former West Berlin--350,000 or 90
percent--making foreigners 16 percent of the former West Berlin's population.
Most of the foreigners live in so-called Altbaugebieten (neighborhoods of old
apartment buildings) in a few sections of West Berlin--Kreuzberg (33 percent
foreigners), Neuk&ouml;lln, and Wedding (27 percent).</tt><p>
<tt>Among major German cities, Frankfurt has the highest percentage of
foreigners, 192,000 or 28 percent; followed by Stuttgart with 142,000 or  23
percent; Munich with 287,000 or 22 percent; and Cologne with 187,000 or 18
percent.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, for the first time, more than half the applicants for public
housing in Frankfurt were foreigners.  The Frankfurt housing office is required
to provide two apartments to Germans for each apartment awarded to
foreigners--the foreigners' quota of scarce public housing is 30
percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Turks in Berlin have an unemployment rate that is twice the rate for German
nationals.</tt><p>
<tt>In Berlin and surrounding Brandenburg, a special task force (Gemeinsame
Ermittlungsgruppe Schwarzarbeit or GES) that includes representatives of the
police, labor department, tax office, health authorities, and customs was
established in 1994 to check employers for  unauthorized foreign workers and
other violations in the underground labor market.  About 9,300 persons were
fined in 955 businesses, including 3,400 foreigners.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC9">Foreign
Workers in
</a>/a></a>Eastern
Europe</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>As European countries such as Germany reduce illegal immigration and access
to asylum, migrants from Asia and Africa are being stranded in Eastern Europe.
An estimated 20,000 to 40,000 Sudanese, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, Kurds and
other foreigners are in Romania--35,000 foreigners have been caught trying to
cross Romania's borders illegally since 1990.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the foreigners are men trying to reach Germany and work--wages in
Romania average only about $100 per month.  However, Romania complains that it
cannot afford to repatriate the foreigners whom it apprehends, since the cost
of flying an illegal immigrant home is often $5,000, while Romania spends only
$1,000 per year to detain illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>The Czech Republic has 10.3 million residents, and five million workers,
including 160,000 foreign residents, and 150,000 foreign workers.  The 112,000
foreign workers with work permits include 60,000 from Slovakia, 27,000 from
Ukraine, and 12,000 from Poland--there are also 37,000 "independent" foreign
workers in the Czech republic--the largest group are 7,700 Vietnamese.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreigners in the Czech Republic with permanent or long-term
residence permits has risen almost fivefold in the past five years.  In 1995,
6,674 foreigners were granted permanent residence--31 percent were Poles.
</tt><p>
<tt>In neighboring Poland, there are believed to be 50,000 to 200,000
foreigners illegally working, and only 11,000 legal foreign workers.  In 1995,
4,000 foreigners applied for permanent residence in Poland.</tt><p>
<tt>Poland's economy is booming--the economy expanded by seven percent in
1995--and unemployment, at 14 percent, is down from a peak 16 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Over 35 percent of all work permits for foreigners in Poland went to
managers in 1995, and another 15 percent to teachers and trainers.  According
to reports, Poland welcomes foreign language teachers, but applications for
other professionals are scrutinized carefully.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Polish Employment Department has only 16 inspectors for the entire
Warsaw district, making it difficult to locate illegal foreign workers.  Polish
employers can be fined zl 5,000 ($1,850) for each undocumented worker, but most
foreign workers refuse to fill out the appropriate paper work and simply
disappear, according to department officials. </tt><p>
<tt>Since July 1995, the enforcement department has found only 100 illegal
workers.  After being detected, it is estimated that half of the illegal
workers return to their home countries, 25 percent find other jobs, and 25
percent apply for work permits to make themselves legal workers. </tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, 841 foreigners sought asylum in Poland, and 600 requested asylum n
the first five months of 1996.  About 20 percent of those who request asylum in
Poland are permitted to stay, versus less than five percent in Germany.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC10">Asylum
Seekers</a> in the
Netherlands</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>Since January 1995, there have been over 80 suicide attempts, 20 of them
successful, by asylum seekers in the Netherlands.  The European refugee
organization, Participating Refugees in Europe, says that the suicides show how
heavily the mental strain weighs on refugees in uncertain status. </tt><p>
<tt>The Netherlands' justice state secretary reported that of the 141 asylum
seekers who were ordered to a repatriation center in a northern province, 65
did not show up.  Of the 76 who did register at the center, 27 disappeared
shortly afterwards.  The center prepares asylum seekers whose applications have
been processed and rejected for repatriation.  Many have no identity papers.
</tt><p>
<tt>On June 28, the Netherlands Justice Minister announced new measures to
prevent smugglers from profiting from smuggling asylum seekers into the
country.  About 75 percent of the asylum seekers arriving in the Netherlands
have paid a travel agent between 5,000 to 30,000 guilders.  </tt><p>
<tt>The government plans to raise the current prison sentence for human
smuggling from one to four years, and impose fines on airlines and other
transport companies that bring foreigners without the proper documentation into
the country.  Currently, 60 percent of asylum seekers have false or no
documents.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC12">Thai</a>land
Offers
Amnesty</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>The Thai Cabinet approved new regulations that will allow currently illegal
workers from Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia who entered Thailand before June 25,
1996 to become legal migrant workers for two years in two sectors--waterways
transportation and manufacturing.  Thai employers will be allowed to have up to
50 percent foreigners in their work forces.</tt><p>
<tt>Under Thailand's 1978 Foreigners' Work Act, illegal foreign workers can be
employed in Thailand after they are registered.  The foreign workers receive a
card similar to the one given to workers awaiting deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>Thai employers with illegal immigrant workers must register them as
"illegal workers" with the local police, bail them out, and then register them
at the provincial labor office between July 1996 and June 1997.  The foreign
workers with permits are to be paid the same wages, and have the same
protections, as Thai workers.  All are expected to leave Thailand after two
years.</tt><p>
<tt>The regulations apply to an estimated 700,000 illegal immigrant workers in
39 of Thailand's 76 provinces--Kanchanaburi, Krabi, Kamphaeng Phet, Khon Kaen,
Chanthaburi, Chachoengsao, Chon Buri, Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai, Chumphon, Tak,
Trat, Trang, Nakhon Pathom, Nakhon Sawan, Nakhon Ratchasima, Nakhon Si
Thammarat, Narathiwat, Prachuab Khiri Khan, Pattani, Phangnga, Ayutthaya,
Phetchaburi, Phitsanulok, Phuket, Mae Hong Son, Ratchaburi, Rayong, Ranong, Lop
Buri, Suphan Buri, Samut Prakan, Samut Sakhon, Samut Songkhram, Surat Thani,
Songkhla, Satun, Uthai Thani, and Bangkok.</tt><p>
<tt>As soon as the amnesty was announced, several agents began advertising in
Burma, offering to help workers find jobs in Thailand.</tt><p>
<tt>The Thai Labor Congress threatened a nationwide strike if the government
did not reverse its plans to legalize foreign workers.  The Labor Congress said
that the amnesty will result in hundreds of thousands of Thai workers losing
their jobs, and lead to social problems. </tt><p>
<tt>The Thai Chamber of Commerce disagreed, saying that giving illegal
immigrants work permits could ease the country's labor shortage, and not affect
local workers, because the foreigners only took jobs that Thais refuse.  Thai
employers argue that the country is short 1.4 million workers.  The Thai
government denied it had plans to allow employers to recruit additional
unskilled foreign workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>A National Security Council official expressed worries that immigration
could threaten Thailand's national security.  One official claimed that
immigrants destroyed natural resources along the border, raised crime and
prostitution rates, and created pockets of minorities, all while carrying
malaria and elephantiasis.</tt><p>
<tt>The National Security Council plans to force all illegal workers out of the
country by 1998.  The NSC hopes that stepped up border enforcement and
sanctions to be place within the next three months, and reduce illegal entry.
The Task Force of Commerce and Industry Council has recommended to the Thai
government that illegal immigrants pay a 10,000 baht surety to discourage them
from settling in urban areas.  </tt><p>
<tt>Thai migrant workers returning home from the Middle East are buying "cheap
gold" in Dubai markets as the most convenient way to bring back their earnings,
competition keeps margins on gold at two to three percent.  South African
krugerrands are then sold by migrants in Bangkok. </tt><p>
<tt>Thailand and Laos have been unable to agree on the fate of about 2,000
Laotian refugees in Thailand who do not meet US resettlement criteria.
Thailand wants to forcibly deport the Laotians, but the Laotian government has
ruled out deportation, while Thailand threatens to stop sheltering and feeding
the Laotians.</tt><p>

returned to Cambodia by bus on June 17.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC13">Camps
for Vietnamese</a>
Close</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On June 30, 1996, most of the camps for boat people from Vietnam were
closed, ending a 20-year saga--the camps were originally supposed to be closed
in 1995.  However, there are still about 31,000 Vietnamese in camps, including
18,000 in Hong Kong.  Hong Kong has until June 30, 1997 to return the
Vietnamese in its camps.</tt><p>
<tt>After the Vietnam war ended in 1975, some 1.5 million people fled Vietnam,
Cambodia and Laos, including 1.2 million who were resettled in the US.  Many
Vietnamese fled Vietnam in small boats, and wound up in camps in nearby
countries.  Of those who fled Vietnam, some 760,000 were resettled in third
countries.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the Comprehensive Plan of Action adopted in 1989, persons who left
their countries of citizenship after March 14, 1989 were no longer presumed to
be refugees fleeing political persecution.  Instead, they were housed in camps,
and interviewed by countries willing to resettle them to determine if they were
economic or political refugees.  About 80,000 Vietnamese were repatriated since
1989; most agreed to return voluntarily with a $240 integration grant and $50
in pocket money from the UNHCR.</tt><p>
<tt>The UN High Commission for Refugees has spent $350 million on the
Vietnamese in the camps since 1989.</tt><p>
<tt>Some of the Vietnamese have been in camps for seven to 10 years, and they
must return to Vietnam in order to apply to join families in the US, Canada,
and Australia.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippine government will allow 1,800 Vietnamese asylum-seekers who
have been living for eight years in a detention camp to remain in the
Philippines.  The Center for Assistance to Displaced People has promised to
care for and help resettle those who do not want to return to Vietnam.  The
Catholic Church in the Philippines argued strongly against forced
repatriation.</tt><p>
<tt>It is estimated that half of the detained asylum-seekers reportedly would
rather return to Vietnam than remain in the Philippines.</tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam receives an estimated $600 million annually in remittances from
Vietnamese abroad.  However, overseas Vietnamese, known as Viet Kieu, have
invested little in Vietnam--they want the government to deal with the return of
property confiscated after 1975 when North Vietnamese forces took control of
Saigon, prompting an exodus of some two million people.</tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam has denied that it will restrict visas for travel to the country.
Visitors to Hanoi's embassies and consulates around the world reported that
visas were not being given out for travel to Vietnam in June.  The halting of
visas coincides with the Eighth Communist Party congress in Vietnam.  In 1991,
during the last party Congress, some foreigners were asked to leave the
country.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 6,000 Laotians are still registered as refugees in Thailand with the
UNHCR, despite the resettlement of more than 300,000.  Almost 260,000
Cambodians were resettled or repatriated before elections held in Cambodia in
1993.</tt><p>
<tt>There are believed to be about 100 Vietnamese and 300 Chinese working
legally in Laos, and hundreds more illegal Vietnamese.  On December 2, 1995,
Laos launched a major crackdown on illegal workers--mostly Vietnamese.</tt><p>
<tt>The minimum wage in Laos is 2,000 kip per day, but Vietnamese will
reportedly work for 1,000 kip.</tt><p>

<tt>The International Labor Office (ILO) estimates there are at least 1.5

most of whom work as domestic servants.  There are an estimated 700,000 illegal
female migrants.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 320,000 Asian women leave their country each year for jobs,

<tt>Only Egypt, Morocco, the Philippines, Seychelles, Chile, Mexico and Sri
Lanka have signed the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights
of  Migrant Workers and their Families, unanimously approved in 1990 by the UN
General Assembly.  The convention must be ratified by 20 countries before
coming into force.</tt><p>
<tt>A UN expert group meeting on Violence against Women Migrant Workers in
Manila in May 1996 concluded with a call for governments supplying or employing
migrant labor to sign agreements that provide better protection for women
workers against abuse and exploitation.</tt><p>
<tt>Sending countries have had little success preventing their nationals from
working in particular countries, or setting minimum wages and other conditions
for them.</tt><p>
<tt>Many countries specifically exclude domestic work from their labor
laws.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines announced that Filipina maids in Singapore could give their
passports to their employers for safekeeping, reversing an earlier decision to
have the maids, and not their employers, hold onto their passports.  Singapore
employers argued that they needed to hold the maids passports to safeguard
their S$2000 bond.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 13, 1996, the Philippines announced new guidelines for Filipina
maids in Singapore, including a minimum monthly salary of at least $300 and a
workday of 16 hours or less.  The going salary for maids in Singapore is $210
per month.  Singapore employers must in addition pay a $231 per month
government tax for each foreign maid they employ.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippine government reported that the Migrant Workers and Overseas
Filipinos Act of 1995 resulted in a 60 percent drop in illegal recruitment in
the Philippines.  Some Philippine labor officials are recommending that the
government redirect overseas workers from Hong Kong to Spain--there are about
100,000 Filipinos in Hong Kong, and 90,000 in Spain.  Monthly wages average
$1,200 in Spain, versus $700 in Hong Kong.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines has been exporting workers since 1974, when then President
Ferdinand Marcos sent workers abroad to earn hard currency and reduce
unemployment.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC17">Australia</a>
Cuts Immigration 10
Percent</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>The Australian government announced the first week of July that it plans to
cut 1996/1997 non-humanitarian immigration by 10 percent, to 74,000 per
year.</tt><p>
<tt>The Australian government also proposed admitting 700 family reunion
migrants if they agree to settle in specially designated areas.  The plan would
require migrants to pay a A$30,000 bond which would be forfeited if they moved
to Sydney, Melbourne and parts of Queensland, where many migrants have settled
in the past.  Approximately 45 percent of Australia's new migrants now settle
in Sydney.</tt><p>
<tt>The proposed program would also impose a two-year waiting period on new
migrants applying for Social Security benefits, saving the government $600
million over three years.  In addition, migrants would be required to pass an
English language test. </tt><p>
<tt>Migrants paying the bond will be able to immigrate quicker.  An additional
500 places would be set aside for a trial program to match up skilled migrants
with employers in regional Australia.  The government said that the bond system
would apply to a new category of 1,200 visas that is being developed.</tt><p>
<tt>Ethnic groups said the new program violated the UN Convention on Human
Rights and harkened back to the past "white Australia" policies.  The Asian
community is concerned that the English language skills required could reduce
the number of immigrants from non-English-speaking countries.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 excluded non-European migrants
during Australia's gold rush, and lasted for 70 years.</tt><p>
<tt>The 20,000 Chinese students who were in Australia during the Tiananmen
Square crackdown on June 4, 1989 were give Australian passports, and they have
now become very desirable marriage partners for Chinese in China.  Some have
returned to China for visits, and been offered up to $30,000 for a marriage of
convenience that would enable their "spouse" to migrate to Australian.  </tt><p>
<tt>Authorities say it is hard to determine how many bogus marriages have
occurred, but they note that the number of applications for spouse visas has
ballooned by more than 30 percent in the past 12 months.  Australia plans to
admit up to 50,500 members of settled residents' families in 1995-96, most of
them spouses and fiancees.</tt><p>
<tt>Almost half of the immigration prosecutions in the first half of 1996
involved immigration marriage fraud.  In 1994-95, Australian authorities
rejected 1057 applications for marriage visas on the grounds that the
relationships were not genuine.</tt><p>
<tt>In July, 1996, a Sydney-based migration agent was sentenced to 18 months
jail and fined $283,200 for arranging bogus marriages.  The agents introduce
visiting Chinese to Australians, then arrange the marriage and complete
immigration forms for a fee of up to $16,000.  </tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>Until 1994, some 70,000 residents of Gaza's one million residents, one of
the world's most densely populated places, commuted daily to jobs in Israel.
However, several bombings led Israel to reduce the number of daily commuters to
20,000, and to close the border for 11 of the past 24 months, including the
time since February 25, 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>According to UN estimates, Gaza residents lose $5 to $6 million daily when
the border is closed, or about $75 per worker per day, including the multiplier
effects of Gaza workers spending the $20 to $40 per day that they typically
earned in Israeli fields and construction sites.  Some Gaza workers said that,
even after paying $300 bribes for work permits, being employed in Israel still
generated higher earnings than employment in Gaza.</tt><p>
<tt>Instead of Palestinians, Israel is importing Romanian, Thai, and other
foreign workers.  There are about 100,000 legal foreign workers in Israel, and
an estimated 100,000 illegal foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>A recent police report indicates that the Romanian, Thai and other foreign
workers imported to work in Israel have contributed to a steady rise in
violence, alcoholism, prostitution and crime.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Romanian Tourism Minister charged that Romanian workers are being
mistreated while they are in Israel.  Romanians, he said, receive half the
salary of Israelis performing similar jobs and have intolerable living
conditions.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC21">US-
Mexican Cooperation on
Immigration?</a>/a></a></h2>
<tt>A June 14-15 conference organized by Frank D. Bean, Rodolofo de la Garza,
Bryan Roberts, and Sidney Weintraub and the University of Texas at Austin asked
what the US and Mexico might do to respond to the apparent US "crisis" over
especially illegal Mexican migration to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Three background facts seem important:</tt><p>
<tt>1. The number of especially illegal Mexican immigrants seems to be
increasing despite new Border Patrol operations meant to discourage illegal
entrants, or at least push them to attempt entry in areas where apprehension is
easier.  The number of Mexican-born persons in the US increased by 400,000
between March 1994 and March 1995, a period in which legal immigration was
about 100,000.  By one calculation, at least 200,000 Mexicans become illegal
residents each year--160,000 who entered without inspection, and 40,000 who
overstayed visas.</tt><p>
<tt>2. Mexico is in the midst of an economic crisis that has been accompanied
by a jump in unemployment and falling real wages, which is one reason why it
appears that over half of the unauthorized Mexican immigrants headed for the US
come from Mexico City.  At the same time, beatings of Mexican nationals in the
US, and crashes involving smugglers, have made the Mexican government very
sensitive to the treatment of some Mexican nationals in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>3. There was much praise for the consultations on migration issues that
have already taken place, and hopes for more such discussions.  However, there
seemed to be less consensus that the US and Mexico could "negotiate" a solution
to the migration crisis.  For example, there was no agreement on what the
ultimate aim of any bilateral migration negotiation would be, and what, if
anything, each side would "give up" to persuade the other side to agree to its
position.</tt><p>
<tt>Most US participants were "friends of Mexico," and most argued that Mexico
must "do more" to help prevent unauthorized Mexican migration from souring the
US-Mexican partnership.  Many disagreed with the "official" Mexican position on
illegal migration to the US:  "the Mexican constitution prohibits the Mexican
government from preventing exits, and Mexico respects the right of the US to
control its borders.  Mexico only asks that the US respect the human rights of
all persons within its borders."</tt><p>
<tt>Many US and Mexican participants urged Mexico to, for example, reconsider
its policy of using police to help prevent criminals from preying on aliens,
but not to prevent the exit of the aliens who are the prey of the criminals.
Some Mexicans countered that the US should do more to offset "anti-Mexican
hysteria" in the US by educating the public about the "facts," although there
was not always agreement on what the facts are.</tt><p>
<tt>Perhaps the most realistic perspective on what appears to be a migration
hump--a temporary increase in migration from Mexico--is that it is in the
interest of both Mexico and the US to stick with Mexico's current stabilization
policy, and hope that it will soon accelerate Mexican economic growth enough to
encourage Mexicans to stay home.  It was widely agreed that the current Mexican
stabilization policy is beginning to restore economic and job growth, and that
it would be best to stay the course rather than change policies.</tt><p>
<tt>Among the other highlights of the conference:</tt><p>
<tt>* Mexico's population growth rate has slowed sharply--for the first time,
fewer babies will be born in 1996 than were born in 1995.  However, there  will
continue to be about 1.5 million Mexicans turning 16 every year for the next
decade.</tt><p>
<tt>* Control over illegal immigration can facilitate legal immigration, both
at the border, and in terms of "closing the back door to keep the front door
open."</tt><p>
<tt>* Just as wage gaps do not have to disappear to eliminate incentives for
Mexico-US migration, so illegal immigration over the southern border may
persist, but its level must be reduced to "tolerable levels" to minimize
adverse US reactions.</tt><p>
<tt>* There are few models of "cooperation on migration" that might guide any
US and Mexican negotiations.  For example, the EU's integration of southern
European nations was brought up many times, but it was noted that e.g.,
emigration from Portugal and Spain was "under control" when negotiations for EU
entry began, that both countries had established social safety nets, and
received EU assistance, to help persons displaced during economic
restructuring, and that gaps were not as wide as in North America--population
growth had already converged, and both Portugal and Spain had per capita
incomes that were about one-fourth of French and German levels in the
mid-1980s.  Even so, the EU insisted on a seven-year wait before Portuguese and
Spanish workers got full freedom to seek work in the EU rights.</tt><p>
<tt>* Both US and Mexican participants may have read too much into Prop. 187 in
California, and the incidents involving aliens along the border.  First, it was
noted that the NUMBER of illegal aliens in the US appears to be increasing even
as estimates of the number shrink--in the early 1980s, there was talk of 12 to
20 million illegal aliens in the US, versus current estimates of 3.2 million in
October, 1992, and increasing by 300,000 per year.  Second, it was emphasized
that Prop. 187 has not been implemented, and that efforts to reduce LEGAL
immigration levels in the current Congress were not successful.  </tt><p>
<tt>* There may be more of a "class" than a country-wide worry about
immigrants.  The perception is that unskilled immigrants are adding to the
poverty population in the US and, while they may arrive with a work ethic, and
not be eligible for welfare benefits, many are employed in high-turnover and
short-career industries, such as agriculture and meatpacking.  Thus, if the US
continues to accept large numbers of poorly educated immigrants, it seems
poised to reduce their access, as well as the access of US-born poor people, to
welfare benefits.  Just as US refugee policy was made in part by the budget
policy of reducing the period of federal reimbursement for benefits, so US
immigration policy may be set indirectly by budget policies.</tt><p>
<tt>* Some participants thought that the best way to deal with the migration
hump would be to have a guest worker policy for Mexicans, either with the quid
pro quo that Mexico help to manage emigration, or independent of Mexican
cooperation on border control.  It was emphasized that there would be
considerable opposition to such a policy in the US, and that it has proven very
difficult for the US to develop mechanisms to certify labor shortages, ensure
that US employers look seriously for US workers and abide by the terms of
worker contracts, and prevent temporary workers from becoming permanent
residents.</tt><p>
<tt>* There is plenty of blame for the current migration patterns.  For
example, the SAW program legalized about one in six adult men in rural Mexico,
and the program's designers asserted that SAWs would keep their families in
low-cost-of-living Mexico, and commute to seasonal US farm jobs.  However, the
US granted Mexicans immigration status, which allowed Mexicans to unify their
families in the US, so that when Mexico accelerated the transformation of its
rural sector in the early 1990s, many SAWs decided to unify their families in
the US.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC2">Welfare
Overhaul and Minimum Wage
Changes</a><a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>In August, President Clinton signed into law two bills that will have
important effects on immigrants.  The Personal Responsibility and Work
Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 makes most legal immigrants ineligible
for federally-funded welfare benefits, such as Supplemental Security Income and
food stamps.  The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 increases the
minimum wage from $4.25 to $4.75 hourly on October 1, 1996, and to $5.15 per
hour on September 1, 1997.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Welfare Overhaul</u>.  On August 22, 1996, President Clinton signed into
law an 800-page welfare reform bill that makes most legal immigrants not
eligible for most federal means-tested assistance programs.  President Clinton
said he was "deeply disappointed" that Congress attached provisions "that will
hurt legal immigrants in America, people who work hard for their families, pay
taxes, serve in our military."</tt><p>
<tt>Clinton pledged that he would try "to remove bureaucratic roadblocks to
citizenship to all eligible, legal immigrants" to minimize the effects of the
immigrant bar.  Clinton directed the INS to try to swear in all persons who
apply to become US citizens within six months of applying.</tt><p>
<tt>Clinton vetoed the first two efforts to reform US welfare policies.  The
bill that became law was approved July 18, 1996 in the House by a vote of
256-170, and approved in the Senate on July 23, 1996 by a vote of 74-24.  The
House approved the final version of the bill July 31 by a vote of 328 to 101,
and the Senate approved the final version on August 1 by a vote of
78-21.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Immigrant Provisions</u>.  The new law prescribes the stages in which
the exclusion of legal immigrants from federally funded assistance is to take
place.  Immigrants who arrive in the US after August 22, 1996 will be refused
benefits from the start.  Over the next 12 months, all current
recipients--including an estimated 900,000 immigrants currently receiving food
stamps, and 500,000 receiving SSI-- must be reviewed by state authorities, and
"unqualified immigrants" are to be removed from the rolls by July 1,
1997.</tt><p>
<tt>Three categories of immigrants are exceptions, and will continue to be
eligible for assistance--refugees in the US less than five years, those in or
veterans of the Armed Services, and non-US citizens who worked at least 10
years in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The new welfare law permits immigrants to continue to participate in Head
Start, job training, and higher education loan programs, under the theory that
such programs help the immigrants to help themselves.  Immigrant children may
also continue to participate in school breakfast and lunch programs.</tt><p>
<tt>The new federal law encourages state governments to deny assistance to
legal immigrants.  Beginning January 1, 1997, states may--but need
not--eliminate cash assistance and Medicaid (health aid) for non-US citizens.
States are prohibited from providing state or local assistance to "unqualified
immigrants" unless they pass a new law after August 1996 that explicitly grants
benefits to e.g. unauthorized aliens.</tt><p>
<tt>Most immigrants coming to the US under family unification preferences must
be "sponsored" by a relative already in the US.  US citizens can sponsor their
spouses, children, and parents for entry, and these relatives can enter without
waiting, but only rarely do we know whether the US citizen sponsors are
native-born or immigrants who became naturalized US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>The welfare law includes a provision similar to the provision in the
pending House immigration bill that requires US sponsors of immigrants to earn
an income of at least 200 percent of the poverty line, for the US sponsor and
the immigrant(s) being sponsored taken together.  The INS by November 1996 is
to develop a new affidavit of support form that will permit federal, state, and
local agencies to sue sponsors who refuse to provide support for the
immigrant(s) they sponsored.  Sponsors will have to keep the INS notified of
changes of address.</tt><p>
<tt>The GAO examined the birthplace of immigrant sponsors, and found that
US-born persons sponsored about 77 percent of the spouses who immigrated in
FY85, while naturalized US citizens sponsored 96 percent of the parents who
joined immediate families in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The effects of denying benefits will be considerable.  Proponents of the
welfare overhaul expect that it will save about $54 billion over six years,
with about 45 percent of the savings coming from denying benefits to non-US
citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>About 1.5 million legal immigrants are now estimated to receive federal
welfare benefits.  In the 1990 Census, about 3.6 percent of native-born persons
reported receiving AFDC payments, as did 3.9 percent of immigrants and their
children.  About 6.7 percent of the native-born received Food Stamps, and eight
percent of immigrants and their children did.  About 40 percent of the
immigrants receiving federal welfare assistance live in California.</tt><p>
<tt>The exclusion of immigrants from federal welfare programs may be reversed.
President Clinton promised to send "corrective legislation" to Congress in 1997
that would permit at least some immigrants to obtain federal welfare benefits.
On August 23, Clinton ordered USDA to give states that request waivers one year
to re-certify current recipients of Food Stamps to determine their status, so
that legal immigrants are not suddenly removed from the rolls.  In states that
request waivers, eligible legal immigrants could continue to receive food
stamps until August 22, 1997.</tt><p>
<tt>Critics of the welfare overhaul argued that excluding immigrants from
federal welfare programs amounted to "taxation without representation," was
"unfair" to cities such as Los Angeles and New York in which immigrants are
concentrated, and provided an inappropriate reason for immigrants to
naturalize.</tt><p>
<tt><u>General Provisions.</u>  The new welfare law ends the open-ended federal
commitment to provide cash payments to poor US residents by converting the Aid
to Families with Dependent Children program--which currently spends $25 billion
per year--into a $16 billion per year block grant program called Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families for states.  States can then provide cash
assistance to poor people as they wish.  </tt><p>
<tt>The new law also limits "lifetime" cash assistance to five years per
family, requires most welfare recipients to work after two years of cash
assistance, and prohibits persons convicted of drug felonies from obtaining
cash benefits and food stamps.  Food stamp benefits are reduced from the
current $0.80 per meal to $0.66 per meal.</tt><p>
<tt>States may provide benefits for more or less than five years for up to 20
percent of recipients.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 4.6 million adults receiving cash welfare assistance,
including 650,000 who are working or in training.  In 1995, about four percent
of the women receiving AFDC payments were working full time.  An estimated 2.3
million largely unskilled and poor adults now receiving cash assistance may be
added to the US labor force.</tt><p>
<tt>States are required to have 25 percent of the adults receiving assistance
working at least 20 hours weekly by 1997, and 50 percent working at least 30
hours weekly by 2002.  The average adult receiving cash assistance has
eighth-grade skills.</tt><p>
<tt>Most current welfare-to-work programs place 20 to 40 percent of those
enrolled in jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>About 49 percent of welfare recipients who have been on the rolls more than
five years are African American, 25 percent are non-Hispanic whites, 19 percent
are Hispanic, and seven percent are in other racial or ethnic groups.</tt><p>
<tt><u>State Reactions</u>.  State and local governments have begun to draw up
plans to deal with poor immigrants who will be removed from welfare rolls as
their cases are reviewed between August 1996 and August 1997.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 40 percent of the legal immigrants receiving welfare benefits live in
California, and state analysts estimate that $6 billion in federal spending for
non-immigrants will be eliminated over the next six years, including $3.7
billion in SSI payments.  There were 322,000 legal immigrants in California
receiving SSI benefits in December 1995, and an estimated 173,000 will lose
them.  About 43 percent of the legal immigrant SSI recipients were in Los
Angeles county, followed by seven percent each in Orange and San Diego
counties, and six percent each in San Francisco and Santa Clara
counties.</tt><p>
<tt>The new welfare law may also re-kindle interest in Proposition 187, whose
implementation was stayed in a November 1995 ruling.  The welfare law includes
provisions that require the US Attorney General, by January 1998, to develop a
system for social service providers to verify immigration status.  States then
have an additional 24 months, until January 2000, to implement this
verification system.</tt><p>
<tt>Furthermore, the new welfare law bars state and local governments from
providing benefits to illegal aliens, and nullifies state and local laws that
prevent state and local government agencies from contacting the INS about
potential illegal aliens--Los Angeles has such a law.  Illegal aliens are
limited to emergency health care, immunization and the treatment of
communicable disease, school lunches, soup kitchens and short-term disaster
relief.</tt><p>
<tt>On August 27, 1996 California Governor Pete Wilson, in a "first step to
implementing federal welfare reform," issued an executive order instructing
state agencies and state-supported colleges and universities to determine what
assistance they provide to the estimated two million to 2.5 million illegal
immigrants in the state, and to make plans to halt those benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>Illegal aliens currently have access to about 20 state-funded programs,
including prenatal care programs (70,000 illegal alien women currently receive
about $1,000 each in prenatal benefits each year); state assistance to families
who adopt handicapped or developmentally disabled children; child abuse
prevention programs; and supplemental disaster relief programs.  In addition,
the executive order is designed to prevent illegal aliens from obtaining
professional and commercial licenses, such as those required of beauticians and
landscapers.</tt><p>
<tt>If not halted by courts, local agencies are expected to begin implementing
Wilson's order within 30 to 60 days.  California agencies are exploring the
idea of using one statewide intake form, and forwarding welfare applications to
the INS's Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system for
verification.  </tt><p>
<tt>SAVE received about four million requests from throughout the US to verify
immigrant status in 1995.  About 20 percent or 800,000 inquiries have to be
researched by hand by INS when the first computer check does not confirm the
validity of the A-number submitted.</tt><p>
<tt>Wilson's executive order does not affect illegal alien children attending
K-12 schools, and the access of illegal immigrants to emergency health
care.</tt><p>
<tt>California is grappling with whether to maintain medical care coverage for
poor immigrants.  If local governments step in to maintain benefits for
immigrants that are now provided or reimbursed by the federal government, then
the welfare bill could wind up shifting costs from federal to state and local
governments.  Some county officials in the San Joaquin Valley, where one-third
of the population is on welfare, and unemployment rates in the winter months
top 20 percent, think that the ban on welfare for legal immigrants, plus the
need to put long-term recipients to work, will bankrupt county
governments.</tt><p>
<tt>In Fresno county, an estimated 25,000 legal immigrants now receive $70
million per year in federal benefits.  In the Imperial Valley along the border
with Mexico, one third of the recipients of the Aid to Families With Dependent
Children program are legal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>California state law obliges the 58 counties to help the poor, and they
spent $460 million to help 160,000 poor and unemployed adults through
county-funded General Assistance programs in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>About three million California residents received $2.5 billion worth of
Food Stamps in 1995, or an average $68 worth of coupons each month, including
one million recipients receiving $875 million in Los Angeles county.  In
addition to removing legal immigrants from the rolls, the new welfare law
limits childless adults to three months of Food Stamp benefits every 36
months.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Minimum Wage</u>.  Many recent immigrants earn the minimum US wage,
which is $4.25 hourly.  On August 20, President Clinton signed legislation that
will increase the minimum wage to $4.75 hourly on October, 1, 1996, and to
$5.15 on September 1, 1997. This is the 16th increase in the federal minimum
wage, which was set at $0.25 in 1938.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 10 million US workers are expected to see their wages rise by 12
percent on October 1, 1996.  Employers may pay $4.25 an hour to newly-hired
workers under the age of 20 for the first 90 days of employment.</tt><p>
<tt>Minimum wage workers employed 2,000 hours per year will see their annual
earnings rise from $8,500 to $10,300 by 1998.</tt><p>
<tt>On August 2, 1996, the House approved the increase in the minimum wage by a
vote of 354-72, and the Senate approved by a vote of 76-22.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC3">Immigration
and Official
English</a><a></a>
Legislation</a>
</a></h2>
<tt><u>Immigration</u>.  The House has not yet officially appointed its members
to the Conference Committee that must work out the differences between the
House and Senate versions of legislation designed to reduce illegal
immigration.  Once the House appoints its members, the Conference Committee
must finish its work within one month.</tt><p>
<tt>Much of the Congressional discussion of immigration in August was among
Republicans, and it centered on whether the Gallegly amendment that would
permit states to deny public education to unauthorized children should be in
the final version of legislation expected to become law in 1996.  The Gallegly
amendment is in the House bill, but not the Senate version.  </tt><p>
<tt>Three options were debated:  Congress could require or allow states to
educate unauthorized children (current practice), ban them (original Gallegly
proposal), or bill them for educational services (compromise).  </tt><p>
<tt>In early August, Gallegly agreed to a compromise to permit previously
enrolled illegal students to remain in US schools for up to seven years, allow
illegal immigrants to pay tuition and remain in US schools, and subject this
provision of the immigration law to congressional review twice during the next
five year.  If the Gallegly amendment becomes law, the General Accounting
Office would study its educational and crime consequences, and then it could be
repealed by a vote of Congress, the same as the procedure included in IRCA to
repeal employer sanctions if the GAO found that they led to
discrimination.</tt><p>
<tt>With the acceptance of these modifications by Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA),
the Republicans were believed to have enough votes to keep the Gallegly
amendment in the final immigration bill that is expected to emerge from the
House-Senate conference committee. </tt><p>
<tt>However, on August 2, President Clinton threatened to veto the immigration
bill if it contained the Gallegly amendment in any form: "the proposed
compromise... will still...permit states to exclude those who cannot afford to
pay tuition--is as objectionable as the original provision... If the
immigration bill contains this provision [the Gallegly amendment], I will veto
it."</tt><p>
<tt><u>Official English</u>.  On August 1, the House approved HR 123, the
Language of Government Act, which designates English to be the official
language of the United States, by a vote of 259-169.  The bill also repeals the
bilingual ballot requirements of the Voting Rights Act.</tt><p>
<tt>The House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee approved the
"English-only" bill by a vote of 19-17 along party lines on July 23, with
Republicans arguing that the bill was needed to prevent "language
ghettos."</tt><p>
<tt>According to proponents, the bill seeks to "help immigrants better
assimilate" and "empower" them with new language and literacy skills by
designating English as the official --  and sole permissible -- language of US
government, with exceptions for security, diplomacy, and public safety.  If
enacted into law, there would be no more non-English tax materials or voting
forms.</tt><p>
<tt>House Speaker Newt Gingrich argued for the bill, noting that California
public schools teach academic subjects in more than 80 languages, and Chicago
schools teach in 100 languages.  He warned that a continuation of such trends
would lead to "decay of the core parts of our civilization."  However, the
English-only mandate would not apply in the case of language education, meaning
that bilingual education programs would not be affected.</tt><p>
<tt>Democrats countered that the most pressing need was for more classes for
immigrants who were eager to learn English.</tt><p>
<tt>A similar bill, S. 356, is pending in the Senate.  President Clinton, who
signed an English-only law as governor of Arkansas, has not indicated what he
will do if official English legislation is approved by Congress.  Across the
US, 23 states, 41 counties, and 15 cities had passed official English laws as
of August 1996.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">Presidential
Politics and
Immigration</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>In July and August, Republicans and Democrats ran campaign ads in
California promising to get tough on illegal immigration.  The Republicans' ads
showed aliens running into the US under spotlights, and accused President
Clinton of spending money on illegals while wages for US workers drop.  The
Democrats showed criminal aliens being removed from the US, and emphasized that
President Clinton had kept his promise to combat illegal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>The Republican Party platform criticizes President Clinton for opposing
Proposition 187 in California in November 1994, and includes the statement that
the party supports "a constitutional amendment or constitutionally valid
legislation declaring that children born in the United States of parents who
are not legally present in the United States or who are not long-term residents
are not automatically citizens."  </tt><p>
<tt>On August 23, 1996, Bob Dole said that he does not support this plank of
the Republican Party platform.  On August 14, Jack Kemp denounced the plank in
the Republican Party platform that commits the Republican party to end
"birthright citizenship" asserting, if you are "born in America, you're an
American."</tt><p>
<tt>If the ban on "birthright citizenship" were to be approved, the 130-year
interpretation of the US constitution would be changed:  the 14th Amendment
guarantees US citizenship to "all persons born or naturalized in the United
States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof."  </tt><p>
<tt>The purpose of the 14th Amendment was to overturn US Supreme Court rulings
that held, in the Dred Scott decision, that blacks who were "imported into this
country and sold as slaves," as well as their descendants, could not become
citizens of the United States.  In the debate over the 14th Amendment in 1866,
one Senator asked "Is the child of the Chinese immigrant in California a
citizen?" and received the answer, yes, "The children of all parentage
whatever, born in California, should be regarded and treated as citizens of the
United States, entitled to equal civil rights with other citizens."</tt><p>
<tt>The US and many other immigrant nations follow this jus soli (law of the
soil) principle of granting citizenship, while many emigration nations,
including Germany, follow the jus sanguinis  (law of blood) method of granting
citizenship to persons born of citizen parents, wherever they were born; this
is why the children of legal Turkish immigrants born in Germany are foreigners,
while the children of ethnic Germans in Russia are German.  Some countries,
including France, have a hybrid system, granting citizenship upon application
at a certain age to persons born in the country.</tt><p>
<tt>The original US Constitution did not define citizenship; there was no
definition of citizenship until the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868.  In
1898, the US Supreme Court held that a child born in San Francisco to Chinese
parents was a US citizen, even though the parents were prohibited by the
Chinese Exclusion Act from ever becoming US citizens.  Republicans assert that
100,000 babies are born to illegal aliens each year in California.</tt><p>
<tt>Peter Schuck and Rogers Smith of Yale Law School wrote a 1985 book,
<u>Citizenship without Consent: Illegal Aliens in the American Polity</u>,
which argued that the constitution PERMITS Congress to decide whether the US
should grant citizenship to babies born within its borders.  When illegal
immigration is "under control," then Schuck and Smith thought that "birthright
citizenship" could be eliminated.</tt><p>
<tt>Demographer Jeff Passel estimates that 700,000 or almost 20 percent of the
four million births each year in the US are to foreign-born mothers.  Most of
these foreign-born women are in the US legally and, of the illegal mothers,
relatively few are believed to come to the US specifically to give
birth.</tt><p>
<tt>In his acceptance speech, Dole said that "a family from Mexico who arrived
here this morning, legally, has as much right to the American dream as the
direct descendants of the Founding Fathers."  Dole warned that the "exits,
which are clearly marked," are for those who have joined the Republican party
because they hoped that Republicans would shut the door to immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Kemp reversed an earlier position, and said that he now supports the
Gallegly amendment to the pending immigration bill that would permit states to
charge illegal alien children tuition to attend K-12 schools.  Kemp also said
that, if elected, a Dole administration would "do its best to stop illegal
immigration."</tt><p>
<tt>The Reform Party may inherit anti-immigrant Republicans.  Kemp was
criticized within the Republican Party for not banning illegal immigrants from
pubic housing when he was secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for not supporting Proposition 187 in 1994, and for not agreeing
in 1996 to urge lower levels of illegal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>Former Colorado Gov. Richard D. Lamm, who opposed Ross Perot to be the
presidential candidate of the Reform Party, used his concession speech to urge
the Reform Party to tackle immigration issues.  Ross Perot has not said much
about immigration, although he cited the prospect of increased Mexico-US
immigration as a reason to oppose NAFTA.  Perot won the Reform Party's
presidential nomination with 65 percent of the 49,000 votes cast.</tt><p>
<tt>Lamm ranks with Pat Buchanan as the Presidential candidate most in favor of
more immigration controls.  According to Lamm, the US is "at a crossroads on
the question of immigration.  We can either import large numbers of low-
skilled workers or we can reach down and train our own underclass.  We cannot
do both.... No other nation in the world has the delusion that it can ignore
its own poor while importing a whole generation of poor people every
year."</tt><p>
<tt>Lamm said that there is "no essential difference...between exporting a job
and importing a worker."  In the first US Census in 1790, four million
residents were counted; in 1994, the US had about 260 million residents, and
Lamm asked "how many people...in a world of limited resources...can we accept
in the United States?"</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration control advocates used the Republican convention in San Diego
on August 12-15, 1996 to spotlight illegal immigration issues.  San Diego is
the "least minority" large city in southern California--its 1.8 million
residents are two-thirds white, and 25 percent Hispanic.</tt><p>
<tt>FAIR held a widely-publicized Immigration Reform Awareness Week that
culminated in a conference August 10, 1996 urging that legal immigration levels
be reduced, a position rejected by Congress in 1996.  Dick Lamm, one of the
speakers, asserted that, "If we have to choose between our 'huddled masses' and
the rest of the world's 'huddled masses,' I'm going to chose our 'huddled
masses'."</tt><p>
<tt>Many of those attending the FAIR conference said that they feared that
Spanish is supplanting English in California and the Southwest.  Some believe
that the US is being "invaded" by Mexicans who are intent upon creating Aztlan,
a mythical homeland of the Mexican people.  Others decried the current US
citizenship surge, fearing that immigrants were naturalizing for "the wrong
reasons," and Mexican proposals that would permit Mexicans living in the US to
vote in Mexican elections.</tt><p>
<tt>Those favoring closer ties with Mexico emphasized that the San
Diego-Tijuana region has three million residents, many of whom moved to the
region from elsewhere, and many of whom commute across the border legally to
jobs. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">SOS</a>
in other
States</a></></a></h2>
<tt>In November 1994, California voters approved Proposition 187, the so-called
"Save our State," by a margin of 59-14 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Proponents of immigration restrictions immediately launched similar
initiatives in Florida and Arizona, and most experts wrongly expected these
initiatives to be put on the ballot, and to be approved by similarly large
margins.  </tt><p>
<tt>For example, about 430,000 signatures are required to put an initiative on
the Florida ballot but, as of Summer 1996, organizers for the Save our State
Committee, and the FLA-187 Committee, had collected only 10 to 20 percent of
the required signatures.  The SOS initiative could bar unauthorized aliens from
receiving most state services; the 187 Committee's initiative would go further,
and require state agencies to report suspected unauthorized aliens who seek
services to the INS.</tt><p>
<tt>An Arizona "Save our State" initiative similar to California's Proposition
187 failed to win a place on that state's ballot in November, 1996 because it
did not collect the required 112,941 signatures by the July 4 deadline.  In
addition to having state agencies screen for unauthorized aliens, the Arizona
measure would have made employers found to have undocumented workers liable to
fines, and would have created a state verification center to help determine
whether job applicants were in the country legally.</tt><p>
<tt>In Oregon, Oregonians for Immigration Reform proposed an initiative that
would require all public education institutions to verify the legal status of
all students, and require publicly-funded institutions to report suspected
illegal aliens to the INS.</tt><p>
<tt>In California, the group that spearheaded Prop. 187 in 1994 plans to place
an initiative before voters in 1998 that would make it a crime to rent or sell
property to illegal immigrants, and allow California businesses to sue
competitors who knowingly hire illegal immigrants, including companies that use
independent contractors who employ illegal immigrants.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to backers, this would end the sanctuary movement, the practice
of some churches sheltering unauthorized migrants.  The initiative would double
penalties of $3,000 to $5,000 if the landlord was a tax-exempt or nonprofit
group.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration control forces in California are attempting to qualify
additional initiatives to put before voters, including the California Lawful
Employment and Residency (CLEAR) initiative, that would impose criminal
penalties for renting, leasing or selling property to illegal aliens, and the
Stop Sucking Oxygen Out of Our State Initiative (SSOOOS).  The SSOOOS would
require the countries of origin of illegal immigrants to replace the oxygen
that illegal immigrants take from California-- one quarter of a cubic foot of
oxygen per breath, multiplied by .0001888 to account for compression, times an
average of 21,613 breaths in a 24-hour period.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC6">INS</a>:
Enforcement, TPS and
Naturalization</a></></a></h2>
<tt><u>Enforcement</u>.  The number of aliens apprehended along the US-Mexican
border in June 1996 was 117,000, or about 4,000 per day, down slightly from
120,000 in June 1995, but up from 81,000 in June 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Demographer Tom Espenshade notes that the variable of interest is not who
"failed" to enter the US--apprehensions--but the number of aliens who elude
apprehension.  His analysis suggests that the estimated number of illegal
aliens in the US is about 2.2 times the number of apprehensions, and that
changes in apprehensions are closely correlated with changes in the stock of
illegal aliens in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Governor Wilson (R-CA) argued that Proposition 187's denial of services to
illegal immigrants would discourage illegal aliens from coming or remaining in
California.  UC Irvine telephone interviews with 160 illegal alien women in
Orange county, however, found that nearly two-thirds of the illegal aliens
interviewed hope to remain in the United States, with or without services.
</tt><p>
<tt>About 23 percent of Orange county residents are Hispanic, and illegal alien
Latinas--whose median age was 27, with two children-- are about four percent of
women 18 and older in the county.  Many of the illegal alien women had
housecleaning and child care jobs.  The UCI researchers, whose findings will
appear in the International Migration Review, argue that 94 percent of Latinos
in Orange county have telephones.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS and local police unveiled a "car stopper," an electrical charge
that disables a car's electronics and stops it.  The car stopper will be used
to stop vans suspected of carrying illegal aliens in an effort to avoid the
chases that have killed 10 illegal immigrants and injured 39 since April
1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS found no evidence of data manipulation in San Diego.  Supervisors
there were accused by the Border Patrol agents' union of manipulating
apprehension data along the San Diego border to prove that Operation Gatekeeper
was successful in pushing aliens attempting illegal entry from west to
east.</tt><p>
<tt>The multi-agency Border Patrol Corruption Task Force also found no evidence
of corruption in an October 3, 1990 incident in which a customs supervisor
allowed a gas tanker later found with four tons of cocaine into the United
States.  After a heated exchange with inspectors, the tanker was stopped, the
driver fled to Mexico, and the cocaine was found.</tt><p>
<tt>On August 29, the INS announced that it had deported or excluded 54,362
criminal and other illegal aliens so far in FY96, the highest number ever.  Of
those aliens removed so far in FY96, about 54 percent committed crimes in the
US.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 74 percent of those removed or excluded so far in FY96 were Mexicans,
followed by the Central American countries of Honduras (4 percent), El Salvador
(4 percent), and Guatemala (3 percent).</tt><p>
<tt>Aliens deported from the US commit felony crimes if they return to the
US.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS stationed an agent at the Anaheim city jail in a two month
experiment, and found that 37 percent of the 1,900 people arrested were born
abroad.  There were 451 illegal aliens among those arrested, or 24 percent of
those arrested, including 410 who had no criminal records.  Most were arrested
for being drunk and other minor offenses.</tt><p>
<tt>On August 8, the INS announced that 27 poultry processors with 41 plants
and 35,000 employees in seven states would join INS's employee verification
pilot system, joining the major meatpackers who signed up for EVP in May 1996.
Under the EVP system, employers hire workers and then submit the A-numbers of
newly hired non-US citizen to INS computers, which tell the employer whether
that particular number has US work authorization.  </tt><p>
<tt>The employer must hire the worker before submitting the worker's A-number
to INS computers--pre-screening an applicant prior to employment is prohibited
as discriminatory.  If the first check fails, there is a secondary check, and
then the employee is permitted to keep working for 30 days, but is asked to go
to INS and check out the problem with the A-number.</tt><p>
<tt>In a test of EVP between September 1995 and June 1996, some 239 employers,
including Disneyland, sent 18,600 "non-US citizen" verification queries to INS.
About 22 percent or 4,000 of the newly-hired workers were asked to go to INS
and straighten out their records, but only 60 showed up at INS--about 1.5
percent.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many observers were surprised by how many apparently illegal workers
applied for jobs even when they knew that their A-numbers would be submitted to
the INS for verification.</tt><p>
<tt>The major loophole in the system is that, if a job applicant claims to be a
US citizen, she is not checked under the EVP system.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 350 employers with 200,000 employees, plus the state of Florida with
95,000 employees, participate in EVP.  The largest participating poultry
processor is Fiedlale Farms in Georgia, with 4,300 employees.</tt><p>
<tt>Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles and federal immigration officials unveiled a new
program to crack down on the state's illegal immigrants.  The new enforcement
plan gives law-enforcement officials computer access to federal databases that
allow police to check the status of immigrants arrested for aggravated
felonies.  In addition, private companies sanctioned for knowingly hiring
illegal immigrants would be prohibited from getting state contracts. </tt><p>
<tt>The INS has stepped up its work-place enforcement.  The INS fined 8,459 US
employers during the first nine months of FY96, versus 11,917 in the 12 months
of FY96.  There have been 55 employer inspections in the Chicago area so far in
FY96, in some cases taking away half of the workers from landscaping
companies.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 24, 1996, a Los Angeles garment sweatshop owner was sentenced to
six months in federal prison--the maximum sentence--for employing about 20
illegal immigrants.<b>  </b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The New York Times on August 18 highlighted corruption at the INS'
Newark office, where a raid on a cleaning company led to the indictment of the
third-ranking INS official for selling papers that allowed smugglers to bring
illegal aliens into the US.  The article noted that, with immigrants willing to
pay $20,000 to $30,000 to enter the US, the temptation for corruption is
great.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 24, 1996, the House approved an added $543 million to the $2.5
billion INS budget for FY97.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b><u>TPS</u>.  On July 29, the INS extended Temporary Protected Status
for nationals of Bosnia-Herzogovina until August 10, 1997, and TPS for Somalis
was extended until September 17, 1997.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Naturalization.  </u>The INS received 1,012,769 applications for
naturalization in FY95, and applications are running about 30 percent higher in
FY96--some 810,000 applications were received in the first eight months of FY96
and, at this rate, there will be about 1.2 million applications in FY96.</tt><p>
<tt>Of the naturalization applications acted on, five to 10 percent are
denied.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Americans Abroad</u>.  The US Department of State estimated that, as of
May 1, 1993, some 2.6 million US citizens lived abroad, including 522,000 in
Mexico, 335,000 in Canada, 215,000 in the United Kingdom, 160,000 in Germany,
131,000 in the Philippines, 125,000 in Israel, and 103,000 in Italy.
Additional legal immigrants who are not US citizens live in other
countries.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Hispanic
Unemployment-Immigrant
Self-Employment</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>Historically, the African-American unemployment rate has been about twice
the white rate, and the Hispanic unemployment rate has been closer to the white
than the African-American rate.  But the Hispanic unemployment rate in the
1990s has climbed, and is now closer to the African-American than the white
rate.</tt><p>
<tt>In July 1996, when the overall unemployment rate was 5.4 percent, the
unemployment rate for whites was 4.7 percent, the unemployment rate for Blacks
was 10.5 percent, and the unemployment rate for Hispanics was nine
percent.</tt><p>
<tt>There are several explanations for the rising Hispanic unemployment rate.
First, about one-third of the nation's 23 million Hispanics in 1990 lived in
California, where the 1990-92 recession was most severe.  California also has
some of the fastest-growing low-wage industries, many of which experience
periodic layoffs.  California has 140,000 of the nation's 950,000 garment
workers, for example, versus 94,000 in New York City, and some 800,000
individuals are employed sometime each year on California's farms.</tt><p>
<tt>A 1994 Census report, "The Hispanic  Population in the United States: March
1993," (Series P20-475) reported that 28 percent of employed Hispanic males
were in operator, fabricator, and laborer occupations, while 29 percent of
non-Hispanic white males were in managerial and professional specialty
occupations.  Hispanic males in 1992 had median earnings of $20,054, about 63
percent of the $31,765 earned by non- Hispanic white males.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1993, there were about six million Hispanic males and four million
Hispanic females employed in the US.  Of the 10 million Hispanic workers, 6.4
million were of Mexican origin, 1.6 million were of Central and South American
origin, 891,000 were of Puerto Rican origin, and 533,000 were of Cuban
origin.</tt><p>
<tt>Second, Hispanics tend to be less educated than whites and African
Americans, making them more likely to lose jobs in recession, and making it
harder for them to find new jobs in recovery.  A Rand study released in July,
1996 stressed the low educational levels of Mexican immigrants to explain why
their median weekly earnings fell between 1970 and 1990 relative to the median
earnings of US-born workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Third, discrimination against Hispanics may have increased in the wake of
Prop. 187 and other anti-immigrant drives.</tt><p>
<tt>Many economists note that Hispanics are young and poorly educated, which
helps to explain their persistently high unemployment rates.  About 80 percent
of white adults and 70 percent of African Americans had graduated from at least
high school 1990, but only 53 percent of adult Hispanics and 46 percent of
Mexican-Americans were high school graduates.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 60 percent of the nation's Hispanics are of Mexican origin, 12
percent are Puerto Rican, six percent are Central American, and five percent
each are from Cuba and South America.</tt><p>
<tt>Hispanic unemployment rates may drop as the California economy recovers.
California's unemployment rate is still higher than the US rate, but job growth
in California in 1996 is once again much faster than US job growth, a result of
jobs created by trade, entertainment, and high-technology to replace jobs lost
in construction and defense industries.</tt><p>
<tt>The revival of job growth and legal and illegal immigration has renewed
interest in the interaction of newly-arrived immigrants and settled unskilled
workers.  Roger Waldinger notes that most 1970s and 1980s research that tried
to find negative effects of immigrants on US-born Black workers--depressed
wages or displacement-- found no smoking gun link, in part because many
African-Americans work for government, for which foreign nationals are not
eligible.  For example, one-third of the African Americans in the labor force
in New York City in 1990 work for the government.  </tt><p>
<tt>Public sector jobs remain attractive to US-born workers.  In Los Angeles in
July 1996, some 25,000 persons showed up to apply for 100 entry-level
janitorial and laborer jobs offered by the city government, suggesting that
those at the bottom of labor market prefer public to private employers.  The
starting wage for these stable jobs is $18,000 per year, or about $9 per hour,
plus health and other benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>In the private sector, however, immigrant networks have combined with
employer attitudes and expectations to make Hispanic immigrants preferred to
US-born unskilled workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexican immigrants in Los Angeles have proven to be better than unskilled
African-Americans in winning jobs at the bottom of the labor market.  According
to Waldinger, Mexican immigrants were over represented in 53 of 82
manufacturing sectors in 1990.  Information about job openings flows long
distances over immigrant networks to Mexico rather than within the inner city
areas surrounding the factories where the immigrants work.</tt><p>
<tt>Furthermore, according to Rand, Mexican immigrants begin their US journey
earning lower wages than similar US-born workers, and the gap widens over time.
Unlike Asian immigrants, who initially earn less than similar US workers, but
catch up and surpass US-born workers within seven to 12 years, Mexican
immigrants do not catch up, and sometimes lag further behind comparable US
workers the longer they are in the US.  For example, the average earnings of
immigrants from Mexico and Central America were 25 to 40 percent lower than
natives' earnings in 1970, and 50 percent lower in 1990.</tt><p>
<tt>Many immigrants begin small businesses.  Is immigrant self-employment a
sign of immigrant success or failure?  Many sociologists regard immigrant
self-employment as a sign of success, and some have suggested that
concentrating immigrants within particular cities permits "enclave economies"
to flourish.  Leading economists, on the other hand, argue that "there is no
evidence that immigrant entrepreneurs are particularly successful" (Borjas,
1990, 163) despite stories of Korean and Latino grocery stores.</tt><p>
<tt>Self-employed immigrants work more hours and earn more than immigrants who
work for wages or salaries, but the self employed also tend to have more human
and financial capital.  For example, among immigrant Korean men in 1979, the
self employed earned an average $23,400, while immigrant wage and salary
Koreans earned an average $16,600.  However, the self employed worked more
hours--2,400 versus 2,000--and were more likely to have migrated earlier--70
percent immigrated to the US before 1975, versus 48 percent of the wage and
salary workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Portes and Zhou used data from the 1980 Census to examine the determinants
of earnings for men 25 to 64 in 1979, and found that economists who control for
education, experience, and hours worked are correct when they assert that
self-employed immigrants do not earn more than similar men with the same
qualifications.  But Portes and Zhou emphasize that there are more "outliers"
among the self employed, meaning that the most successful self-employed
immigrants earn far more than average, and that, in some cases, successful
self-employed immigrants also become community leaders.</tt><p>
<tt>Will education eliminate the Hispanic-White unemployment gap?  The Rand
study analyzed Census data and data from a US survey of 21,000 15- and 17-year
olds, and concluded that most immigrants generally do well in the US
educational system.  However, Mexican immigrants lagged behind other
immigrants.  In 1990, only 74 percent of the 15- and 17-year olds living in the
US who were born in Mexico were in US schools, versus 95 percent of US born
youth and other immigrant youth.</tt><p>
<tt>Many Mexican youth stop going to school after the seventh grade, so that,
if a Mexican youth arrives in the US at age 15, she may have already been out
of school for two years.  </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC8">Regulating
the Immigrant Labor Market</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>For the first time, the US Department of Labor has run out of H-1B visas
for foreign professionals to enter the US to work for up to six years.  A
maximum 65,000 visas are available each year, and on August 28, 1996, DOL
announced that US employers requesting H-1B workers would have to wait until
the new federal fiscal year begins on October 1, 1996.  In FY96, about 55,000
H-1B workers were admitted. </tt><p>
<tt>It is difficult for the government to regulate the admission of legal
immigrant and non-immigrant foreign workers, and to prevent unauthorized
workers from being employed.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 24, 1996, a federal district court struck down DOL regulations that
would have required US employers wanting to hire<u> </u>foreign professionals
under the H-1B program to take more steps to protect US workers.  DOL in
December 1994 laid out in regulations how US employers must calculate and
document the "prevailing wage" that they offer to US and H-1B workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Court's ruling was narrow, only agreeing with complaining employers
that DOL had not given them enough time to comment on the proposed rules.  DOL
indicated that it believed that fundamental reforms were needed in the H-1B
program to protect US workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Microsoft has been one of the most aggressive users and defenders of the
H-1B program, which permits employers to "attest" that they tried and failed to
find US computer programmers and other professionals, and then foreign
professionals arrive and remain for up to six years.</tt><p>
<tt>The Gannett News Service did a series of articles in August 1996 that
concluded that the US system for certifying that a US employer "needs" foreign
workers is broken.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are two types of labor certification--for employers requesting
immigrants, and for employers requesting temporary workers.  US employers
require that DOL certify their need for immigrant workers, and for unskilled
nonimmigrant or temporary workers.  There is no labor market test for US
employers who want H-1B professionals--US employers only attest that they are
paying prevailing wages.</tt><p>
<tt>Echoing the DOL Inspector General report issued in June 1996, Gannett said
that the $270 million spent by employers on labor certification, and the $50
million spent by the federal government to certify employer requests for
foreign workers, is largely a going-through-the-motions exercise for US
employers who are, in many cases, already employing the foreign worker while
"searching" for US workers.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Gannett, between 1988 and 1996, many non-professionals were
admitted as permanent immigrants for US employers who claimed that they could
not find US workers.  Some 40,000 housekeepers, nannies and domestic workers
were admitted as immigrants, plus 15,000 cooks and chefs, 3,000 auto repair
workers, 252 fast-food workers, 199 poultry dressers, 173 choral directors, 156
landscape laborers, 122 short-order cooks, 77 plumbers, 68 doughnut makers, 53
baker's helpers, and 38 hospital janitors.</tt><p>
<tt>DOL has issued new regulations that would allow the agency to check on
employers of H-1B foreign workers  without waiting for a complaint to be filed
which asserts that the US employer was violating his promise to pay prevailing
wages, but a provision in the pending immigration bill would limit unannounced
DOL checks to employers where more than 25 percent of employees are
immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS does not notify H-1B nonimmigrants when their work permits are
about to expire, and does not check to ensure that they leave the US.  Under
pending immigration legislation, nonimmigrants who remain in the US too long
would be denied re-entry for at least a year.</tt><p>
<tt>In recent years, about 90,000 legal immigrants per year have been admitted
to the US on the basis of their skills and US labor market needs, well under
the 140,000 per year limit.  CIR Commissioners Hill and Morrison, in an August
5, 1996 article, criticized the lobbyists of high-tech firms who blocked a
CIR-recommended reform that would have traded faster access to immigrant
workers for a reduction in the annual quota to 100,000, and a fee that would be
used to train US workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Since Hewlett-Packard complained in May 1996 that labor certification costs
$15,000 and takes 22 months, Hill and Morrison advocate a pilot program in
which firms willing to pay $10,000 are exempt from labor certification.</tt><p>
<tt>The federal government and many state governments have special enforcement
programs that aim to prevent unauthorized workers from finding jobs, or, if
employed, prevent US employers from violating labor laws.  The federal
government issues a Garment Enforcement Report each quarter, and it noted that
2,500 garment workers were owed $700,000 in the April-June quarter of
1996.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC10">French
Police Remove Immigrants from
Church</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On August 23, 1996, French police removed 98 men, 54 women, and 68 children
who took refuge in Saint Bernard's Church near Montmartre in Paris two months
ago in an attempt to remain in France after they were ordered to leave.  The
foreigners, mostly from Mali, had their applications for asylum rejected; were
the spouses of legal immigrants but not entitled to live in France; were visa
overstayers; or, were persons born in France of foreign parents.  Since 1993,
persons born in France are not entitled to automatic French citizenship.</tt><p>
<tt>Some of the immigrants began a hunger strike that attracted widespread
publicity and support in June 1996.  The immigrants demanded one-year work
permits to give up the hunger strike, but the government, under criticism for
not being "tough" on illegal immigration, promised only an individual review of
each immigrant's deportation order.  The government announced that all of the
hunger strikers would be deported.</tt><p>
<tt>On August 24, 57 Africans were flown home, including four who were removed
from the church, although local airport workers in Africa refused to unload the
plane.  Most of the other immigrants removed from the church were freed by
court order, although many received orders to leave France by September 12.
The government announced that those sent back to Africa would receive
resettlement aid, and that 30 to 40 of those in the church would receive
residence permits.</tt><p>
<tt>In protest, over 10,000 people demonstrated in support of the immigrants.
Most commentators noted that the French government succeeded in angering the
left by entering the church, and the right because many of those in the church
were set free by courts.</tt><p>
<tt>President Chirac said that he hoped the police action would send the
message to illegal aliens that "there is no more chance for you in
France."</tt><p>
<tt>The immigrant protest began in another church in March 1996.  The church
had been occupied by 300 African migrants since June 28, 1996, and the interior
ministry gave permission for 48 to stay in France--those who had children born
in France before the law changed January 1, 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>After January 1, 1994, children born in France have to apply for French
citizenship between the ages of 16 and 21 as a way of demonstrating their
genuine desire to become French, and young people with criminal records can be
refused naturalization.  Before 1994, foreigners born in France could become
French citizens automatically at the age of 18.  Foreigners who married French
nationals after 1994 had to wait 12 rather than six months for residence
permits, and illegal alien spouses have to return to their countries of origin
to obtain visas.</tt><p>
<tt>As the Africans gained publicity with their hunger strike, their occupation
of the church became a test of the French government's "toughness" on illegal
immigration. </tt><p>
<tt>On August 12, police entered the church to remove 10 hunger strikers.  The
hunger strikers were taken to a nearby hospital for check-ups; most returned to
the church the same day.  A parade of celebrities, including the widow of
former president Mitterrand, visited the hunger strikers in the church after
their release from the hospital.  Supporters of the Africans ringed the church
in an effort to prevent the police from entering.</tt><p>
<tt>The Interior Ministry announced that, in the first six months of 1996,
7,362 aliens were forcibly removed from France, versus 5,868 in the first six
months of 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>There are nearly 3.6 million foreigners living legally in France, a country
of 57 million.  The number of illegal foreigners is estimated to be 100,000 to
400,000.</tt><p>
<tt>According to an article in the September/October Foreign Affairs, France
has four to five million Muslim residents--half French citizens.  With almost
10 percent of the French population being Muslims, Islam has become the second
most important religion in France.  According to the article, "France's Muslim
community is probably the first in history that has contemplated integration
into a Christian society," an integration that France encourages with rations
in accord with Islamic dietary law to believers in the military and in
prison.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, who criticized the government for
not expelling the African immigrants, also criticized the French soccer team
for recruiting players from outside of France and "baptizing" them as French.
Since 1945, 15 percent of the French professional soccer players have been
foreign-born.  Currently, all the players are French citizens, but one was born
in Ghana, another has dual Portuguese/French citizenship, and others have
Italian, Algerian or Tunisian parents. </tt><p>
<tt>The Count of Paris made a rare public comment on July 10 saying that "If
immigrants, no matter where they are from, settle in our country, then they
must adopt our civilization and bend to our rules, habits and
lifestyles."</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC11">Bosnians
and Construction in
Germany</a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>Dieter Spranger, Christian Democratic Union finance minister of the state
of Baden-Wurttemberg, said on August 15 that the Bosnians are overstaying their
welcome in Germany, and that they should return to Bosnia immediately to help
with reconstruction.  Most of the 350,000 Bosnians in Germany are Muslims.  The
UN estimates that 70 percent of the Bosnians in Germany are from
Serbian-controlled areas, and that most will not be re-admitted to their
original residences.</tt><p>
<tt>Bosnians were to scheduled to leave Germany for Bosnia on July 1, 1996, but
the 16 state or Laender, who make expulsion decisions, agreed not to force
Bosnians to leave on that date.  The new date to begin repatriations is October
1, 1996.  One state, North Rhine Westfalen, is planning to offer departing
Bosnians DM600 per adult and DM300 per child as start up assistance.</tt><p>
<tt>The German asylum office is scheduled to be reduced from 3,400 to 2,500
employees, as the number of asylum seekers continues to remain at about 9,000
per month.  Most asylum applications are rejected within eight to 10 weeks.
</tt><p>
<tt>A UN study criticized Germany for not providing adequate treatment to
children fleeing war.  The report concluded that especially unaccompanied
children were hurt by the passage of third-country legislation effective July
1, 1993 that said that persons passing through "safe" countries en route to
Germany had to request asylum there.  The study was based on interviews with
some of 10,000 asylum-seeker children in Hamburg, of whom 3,000 are
unaccompanied children. </tt><p>
<tt>About 1,400 foreigners per month were caught trying to sneak into Germany
so far in 1996, down from an average 1,700 per month in 1995. </tt><p>
<tt>There was a wave of firebombings of Turkish-owned businesses in Germany and
Switzerland in late July in support of Kurdish hunger strikers in Turkish
jails.  On July 28, the Turkish prisoners abandoned their 69-day old hunger
strike after 12 prisoners died.  About 300 people at 43 jails for political
prisoners were on what they termed a "death fast."</tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 2,000 leftist political prisoners in Turkey, plus
another 4,000 prisoners held on charges of supporting Kurdish
separatism.</tt><p>
<tt>German police broke-up a smuggling network which brought thousands of
Afghanistanis and Lebanese to Germany.  The cost of passage to Germany runs
about $10,000 for an individual, and $33,300 for a family.  German police also
arrested a resident from Mongolia who sold forged residence permits to
foreigners for DM150 to DM250 each.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign firms now do 15 percent of the building in Germany, up from two
percent in the early 1990s.  Increased foreign competition is expected to cause
up to 25 percent of Germany's 76,000 construction businesses to go bankrupt
because of their high costs.  There are about one million construction workers
in Germany, of whom about 185,000 or 18 percent were unemployed in June 1996.
There are believed to be 400,000 foreign construction workers in Germany, half
illegal.</tt><p>
<tt>On August 23, 1996, the union IG Bau and the two leading construction
employer associations agreed to request a minimum hourly wage of  DM17 for West
Germany, and DM15.64 for East Germany, down from earlier plans for minimum
wages of DM18.60 and DM17.11.</tt><p>
<tt>The Social Democrats have called for limits on the number of "DM 590 jobs."
Jobs that pay less than DM 590 per month are exempt from social security and
other payroll taxes that add over 40 percent to wage costs.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC12">Hungarian/Czech
Foreign
Workers</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>Hungary is simultaneously exporting and importing labor, with Hungarians
going to work, often illegally, in neighboring Austria, while Ukrainian,
Romanian and Yugoslav migrants fill jobs in Hungary.  The result is that wages
vary by location within Hungary.  Construction wages are eight to 10 times
higher near Austria than along the Romanian border.</tt><p>
<tt>The Hungarian Central Statistical Office reported that 200,000 foreigners
were living legally in Hungary in 1994--including 105,000 Romanians, and 16,000
persons from the ex-Yugoslavia and the ex-USSR.  Hungary granted citizenship to
25,000 foreigners in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the foreigners living in Hungary are not permitted to work--there
were 15,000 to 45,000 valid work permits in effect sometime in 1994.  Half of
the foreign workers were in Budapest.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the foreigners without work permits are Hungarian-born Romanians
who work in construction and on farms in eastern Hungary.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 120,000 Hungarians were living abroad in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>In the Czech Republic, rapid economic growth is fueling demand for
construction workers.  As in Hungary, many native workers are seeking
higher-paying jobs in Austria and Germany, and foreign construction workers are
streaming into the Czech Republic, mostly from Slovakia and the Ukraine.  In
June 1996, there were an estimated 100,000 Ukrainian workers employed in
Prague. </tt><p>

60,000 in Moscow, where foreigners are one percent of the capital's work force
of seven million.  One third of the foreign workers in Moscow are from Ukraine,
15 percent are from Turkey, and six to seven percent each are from Georgia,
Moldova and Belarus.</tt><p>
<tt>About 65 percent of the foreign workers in Moscow are employed in

<tt>There are believed to be 400,000 illegal foreign workers in Moscow, most
from nations created out of the ex-USSR.  The Russian Federal Migration Service
said that "Moscow cannot do without [a] foreign workforce."</tt><p>
<tt>In 1992, the Russian government established procedures for recognizing
refugees, and invited the UNHCR to establish an office and facilities in Russia
to house refugees.  Since 1992, more than one million foreigners have
registered with the Federal Migration Service seeking refuge in Russia.  About
60 percent come from Afghanistan.  Most others come from countries where
Aeroflot tickets can be bought cheaply, such as Somalia, Iraq, Angola and
Ethiopia.</tt><p>

for asylum seekers and refugees, housing 830 people.</tt><p>
<tt>There is continued concern about the fate of persons who were made

government also reports that Russians in Latvia face job discrimination and are
barred from filling certain jobs, such as firefighters and pharmacists. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC16">Thailand</a>
To Legalize Illegal Foreign Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Thailand in August announced regulations to implement the legalization
program it announced on June 25, 1996 for an estimated 700,000 illegal
immigrants from Myanmar (Burma), Laos and Cambodia.  The regulations include a
requirement that Thai employers must follow Thai labour laws when employing
newly-legalized workers, which means that the newly-legalized should get the
same wages as Thai workers.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the National Security Council, permitting currently illegal
workers to work legally for two years will reduce illegal immigration.  </tt><p>
<tt>Several Thai newspapers, however, noted that the police were often in
league with alien smugglers, so that illegal immigration may increase.  One
employer with rubber plantations and construction firms in Phuket reported that
local officials paid 350 to 500 baht for each illegal worker they delivered.
Many newspapers questioned how police who had failed to prevent the entry of
illegal aliens would ensure that they return after two years.</tt><p>
<tt>In northern Thailand, coyotes want 5,000 kyats to enter from Myanmar, and
brokers there charge 3,500 baht for the trip to Bangkok.  About 100 Myanmar
nationals are said to cross the Moei River into Tak, Thailand illegally every
day.  Tak has 25 immigration officers who have to cover five border
districts.</tt><p>
<tt>Thai employers have up to 180 days, starting September 1, 1996, to register
the illegal immigrants who went to work for them before June 25, 1996.  Workers
who are registered can get two-year work permits.  Employers must pay a
5,000-baht bond and a 1,000-baht fee for each foreign worker that they want to
legalize.</tt><p>
<tt>In March 1992, Thai employers were allowed to legalize unskilled foreign
workers in four provinces bordering Myanmar.  Local employers "did not
cooperate," and illegal foreign workers spread to other sections of Thailand.
The government extended permission to hire foreigners to 43 provinces including
Bangkok.</tt><p>
<tt>The 1996 legalization is intended to get employers to cooperate by
identifying and registering illegal workers so that they can be removed from
Thailand after their two-year work permit has expired.</tt><p>
<tt>Minimum wages in August 1996 for unskilled workers are 145 baht per day in
Bangkok and five surrounding provinces, 126 baht in six provinces, and 118 baht
in the remaining 63 provinces--Thailand has 76 provinces, including
Bangkok.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the regulations announced in August, newly-legalized workers can be
employed in the manufacture of shrimp paste, fish sauce, tobacco, or for jobs
such as drying cassava in the sun and milling rice.  They can also be employed
in farming, fisheries, construction, mining, salt-farming, brick-making and
working as household servants. </tt><p>
<tt>An academic, Tiang Phadthaisong of the Community Medicine Department at
Chiang Mai University, charged in a recent paper that family planning has been
too successful, reducing the number of children by 50 percent in a decade, and
causing labor shortages.</tt><p>
<tt>According to one estimate, some 450,000 Thais work overseas, including
150,000 in Taiwan, and the Thai migrants reportedly remit over $1 billion
annually.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC17">Japan</a>:
No to Unskilled </a>Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>In December 1995, the Japanese government agreed to accept more skilled
foreign workers, but announced that it would continue to ban the admission of
unskilled foreign workers.  Some Japanese companies are extending lifetime
employment to their professional foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>A July 3, 1996 survey reported that the number of Japanese opposed to
allowing unskilled foreign workers into Japan rose by 15 percentage points over
the past five years.  Japanese employers get around the ban on hiring unskilled
foreign workers by employing ethnic Japanese from South America, students and
trainees, and illegal workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some employers have 20 percent foreign workers.  In Oizumimachi, Gunma
Prefecture, foreigners, many of them of Japanese descent and hired by small and
medium-sized businesses, exceed 10 percent of the town's total
population.</tt><p>
<tt>In May and June 1996, a concentrated enforcement action against illegal
aliens resulted in the removal of 4,069 foreigners, 90 percent of whom were
working illegally.  Over one-fourth of those removed from Japan were South
Koreans, followed by 700 Chinese and 500 Thais.  Most of the men were employed
in construction, and the women were employed as bar hostesses.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, some 55,740 illegal aliens were removed from Japan, down 16
percent from 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>In Japan, illegal aliens are often apprehended when they turn themselves in
to authorities to get the exit permit needed to leave the country.  About 60
percent of those apprehended in May-June turned themselves in.</tt><p>
<tt>Two Japanese owners of a manpower service company were arrested for sending
four Japanese-Brazilians to engage in manual labor between April and July 1995,
and for sending another 300 Japanese-Brazilians to 40 companies in Tokyo and
four neighboring prefectures to illegally work.  Private employment service
firms are prohibited from recruiting or deploying manual workers in
Japan.</tt><p>
<tt>In July, illegal Chinese and Myanmarese workers were found working in the
Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo.  The Chinese workers earned some 12,000 yen per
day, or about $114 per day or $14 per hour, for handling fish and processing
them from 11 PM to 7 AM.</tt><p>
<tt>A growing number of Chinese and other foreigners, mostly Asian, are working
illegally in the Japanese fish industry.</tt><p>
<tt>Kawasaki City, south of Tokyo, in April 1996 announced plans to permit
non-Japanese to apply for all local civil service jobs except fire department
jobs.  In May 1996, a Tokyo court upheld a national law that requires civil
servants to be Japanese. The court ruled against a second-generation Korean
nurse who was denied a management job because she was not Japanese.  However,
Kawasaki City plans to eliminate its nationality requirement so that ethnic
Koreans can hold civil servant jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 630,000 Koreans who are not Japanese citizens living in
Japan.</tt><p>
<tt>Until the peace treaty of April 1952, Koreans living in Japan were Japanese
citizens.  In 1953, the Japanese government decreed that "public servants
involved in the formation of the national will or in the exercise of national
authority must be Japanese nationals." </tt><p>
<tt>Despite the ban on non-Japanese holding civil service jobs, about one-third
of Japanese cities do not require applicants for jobs to prove that they are
Japanese citizens.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC18">Hong
</a> Kong:  Crime and

Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Illegal immigrants from China are blamed for a rash of violent crimes in
Hong Kong.  Most of the crimes committed by illegal immigrants are in the New
Territories, where an average of 64 Chinese are apprehended every day.  The
Hong Kong police report that some illegal immigrants have been caught 100
times, and have become "professional" border crossers.  The number of
multiple-entry illegals in 1996, up from a figure of 27 percent in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>About 150 Chinese immigrate to China every day:  most are the wives and
children of Hong Kong men.</tt><p>
<tt>Labor troubles are plaguing the Hong Kong airport construction project.
Contractors claim that they are so short of workers that, if they cannot import
additional foreign workers, the airport will not be finished.  However, local
unions counter that employers prefer foreign to local workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Several of Hong Kong's legislators have recommended that an independent
committee study the importation of foreign workers for airport construction
jobs.  Some foreign workers went on strike to protest irregular payroll
deductions. </tt><p>
<tt>According to one Hong Kong legislator, wages have fallen because of foreign
construction workers.  Government data indicate that the average wage for an
foreign craftsman is about HK $15,000 per month, half of the HK $30,000 a local
craftsman expects.  </tt><p>
<tt>The contracts of many foreign workers expire at the end of 1996, but Hong
Kong employers want to import replacements.  Each year, about 11 percent of the
average 30,000 displaced manufacturing workers go into construction. </tt><p>
<tt>The old Hong Kong airport is being used as a transit center for smuggling
immigrants from China to Canada, the US and other destinations.  US authorities
report that, although boat smuggling has decreased, airline smuggling is on the
rise.  There were 341 cases in 1995 of people destined for Canada trying to
board flights with suspicious or forged travel documents. </tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong Governor Chris Patton estimates that over 8,000 ethnic minorities
in Hong Kong will become homeless after the 1997 turnover.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Australian foreign minister confirmed that up to 95,000 Hong Kong
residents could be allowed into Australia after the turnover, mostly persons
born in Hong Kong who have multiple-entry visas to Australia.  They would be
allowed to stay in Australia for up to three months, then apply for permanent
residency.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are also about 20,000 Hong Kong students in Australia who could apply
to remain, and another 50,000 Hong Kong Chinese who carry Australian passports.

Maid Returns Home</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Philippine maid Sarah Balabagan came home to a hero's welcome in August,
after being jailed in the United Arab Emirates for nearly two years for killing
her 85-year-old employer in self-defense.  Instead of being hanged, Balabagan
was given 100 lashes and made to pay  $40,000 blood money.  Balabagan says she
is 17, although her documents say she is 30.</tt><p>
<tt>Balabagan is now a millionaire, having received more than a million pesos
from a French non-government group called "Save Sarah Balabagan Movement."  A
German movie company has offered her $5 million for the rights to her
story.</tt><p>
<tt>The ILO office in Manila reportedly estimates that there are 4.5 million
Filipinos employed abroad, half working as illegals.  An additional two million
Filipinos live permanently abroad, including 1.1 million in the US, according
to the International Alliance of Filipino Migrant Workers, known by its acronym
Migrante.</tt><p>
<tt>The ILO, in a recent report, noted that Filipinos are likely to continue to
emigrate for decades: even if "macro-economic recovery was quick, robust and
sustained, the time taken to come within sight of the turning point in the
domestic labor market might have to be measured in decades, not years."</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippine economy grew by almost six percent in 1995, and the country
created 500,000 to one million new jobs for the 700,000 work force entrants.
The unemployment rate is officially eight percent.  In 1994, some 775,000
persons joined the labor force, while 719,692 persons left for work
abroad.</tt><p>
<tt>The ILO estimates remittances to be $3 billion per year, equivalent to more
than 20 percent of export earnings, and as much as four percent of GDP.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Migrante, there have been at least 40,000 documented cases of
abuse of Filipino migrant workers.  Migrante says there are 400 Filipinos in
Saudi jails, including 40 on death row, although the government reports that
there are only 50 Filipinos in foreign prisons, and only 10 sentenced to
death.</tt><p>
<tt>There are over 500,000 Filipino workers in Saudi Arabia, including 160,604
who were deployed there in 1995.  Most are professionals or skilled and
semi-skilled workers--about 15 percent of the Filipinos in Saudi Arabia, or
75,000, are maids.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, some 51,701 Filipinos were deployed to Hong Kong, followed by
Taiwan, 50,538; United Arab Emirates, 26,235; Japan, 25,032; Malaysia, 11,622;
Singapore, 10,736; Qatar, 9,961; Kuwait 9,852; and, the US, 7,456.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines first began to encourage migration for employment abroad in
1974.  The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) is now discouraging
Filipino women from going abroad as maids by requiring that they be least 25
years of age.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines in August implemented new guidelines for the recruitment of
maids to work in Singapore.  On August 8, 160 Singaporean recruitment agents
were briefed on Manila's new guidelines for the deployment of Filipino domestic
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The recruiters, all members of Local and Foreign Workers Employment Agents
Association of Singapore, signed an agreement with the Philippine Overseas
Labour Office in Singapore, pledging to deposit S$5,000 as a security bond with
the Philippine Embassy.  Violations of the new rules will lead to a forfeiture
of the bond and possible loss of accreditation. </tt><p>
<tt>The recruiters predict that the number of Filipino domestic workers in
Singapore will increase 50 percent after the new guidelines are in place.
</tt><p>
<tt>Some of the agents reportedly fear that Singaporeans who want to hire maids
will recruit them privately, via maids already working, and bring them in as
tourists to avoid the bond.</tt><p>
<tt>In Hong Kong, plans to require employers of Filipino maids to post a HK$200
deposit with the local consulate were reportedly delayed by too few staff to
collect the fee.  Hong Kong employers currently pay HK$425 to the consulate to
process contracts, and the extra HK$ 200 was to be used to authenticate
contracts.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC20">Singapore</a>:
Managing
Migration</a></a</a></h2>
<tt>Singapore is widely regarded as a controlled society that can manage with
precision the foreign workers who are about one-sixth of the island's labor
force.  However, there are at least weekly reports of illegal aliens
apprehended in Singapore's construction industry.  </tt><p>
<tt>Construction represents a special problem.  Since 1992, Singaporean
construction employers have been permitted to have five foreign workers for
each local worker.  Special rules apply to workers from non-traditional source
countries.</tt><p>
<tt>Many construction employers do not register their foreign workers to avoid
paying a levy or tax of S$440 per month for unskilled foreign workers.  For
example, an inspection of 139 construction workers in August turned up 66 with
no or false documents.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign students are increasingly caught working illegally as bar and
karaoke lounge hostesses, laborers, shop assistants, sales promoters, and
waiters.  In 1994, 48,883 student passes were issued to students from China and
other Asian countries, and 38,383 were issued in 1995.  Chinese students now
need to be interviewed in Beijing, and have a local Singaporean sponsor post a
S$5,000 bond.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign students are prohibited from working in Singapore, and those
apprehended can be jailed for up to six months and fined S$1,000, but most are
simply deported, and required to forfeit security deposits of  S$1,000 to S$
5,000, depending on their country of origin.  Employers found with illegal
student workers are fined two to four years worth of foreign worker tax (levy),
or S$ 200 to S$ 450 per month.</tt><p>
<tt>Singapore has averaged nine percent economic growth over the past 30 years.
In August, the Monetary Authority of Singapore attributed 1.5 to two percent of
the country's economic growth to the increased number of foreign workers since
1992, and more particularly since December 1994, when quotas were
increased.</tt><p>
<tt>However, the economy is expected to grow by only six percent in 1996
because of a slowdown in electronics, which account for 15 percent of GDP, and
52 percent of manufacturing output.</tt><p>
<tt>Increased economic competition in industries such as shipbuilding from
other nations that, in some cases, use foreign workers after they have left
Singapore, are threatening the image that Singapore can "manage migration."
Singapore produced $2.5 billion worth of ships in 1995, but Middle Eastern
nations such as Dubai are increasingly effective competitors, and they employ
in some cases foreign workers after they have left Singapore.</tt><p>

Economic Growth and Foreign
Workers</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>The Seventh Malaysia Plan (1996-2000) projects continued growth in one of
East Asia's miracle economies, led manufactured exports produced with the help
of foreign workers.  In 1995, the Malaysian government offered incentives to
promote key industries such as micro-electronics, automotive, aerospace,
automated manufacturing, bio-tech and information technology, in line with
Malaysia's "Vision 2020" goal of becoming a developed country in 2020.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia's economy grew at a rate of 9.5 percent in 1995, and is projected
to expand by over eight percent in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia has an estimated 1.2 to 1.7 million foreign workers, with perhaps
half having legal status.  A Malaysian youth group in August approved a
resolution calling for a law that would "prohibit  foreign workers, especially
Bangladeshis, from marrying Malaysian women."  The Deputy Human Resources
Minister urged employers to police the hostels that house especially female
migrant workers, since many allegedly moonlight as prostitutes.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia has no minimum wage legislation, so workers frequently move from
job to job in search of higher pay, better benefits, or more amenable
supervisors.  As rural Malays migrate to cities for manufacturing jobs, many
find that they cannot afford housing.  A low-cost house has a selling price
under 25,000 ringgits (US $10,000), and 500 to 700 square feet.  However,
manufacturing wages are typically 450 ringgits (US $180) per month, plus
additional overtime pay of another 200 ringgits (US$ 80) per month.</tt><p>
<tt>High housing prices and low salaries encourage many internal migrants and
foreign workers to "squat," either by building their own accommodations, or by
putting large numbers of residents in one house. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC22">Taiwan</a>
Freezes Worker
Imports</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>Taiwan's Council for Economic Planning and Development, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, and the Council of Labor Affairs moved on August 11, 1996 to
halt foreign worker imports after 280,000 permits have been approved since
1989.  The approved permits for foreigners who have not yet arrived will be
given to employers who hire more of Taiwan's aborigines, and employers who buy
permits that are auctioned off to raise funds for vocational training and
unemployment pay.</tt><p>
<tt>The foreign worker freeze is meant to counter rising unemployment, which
averaged 1.8 percent in 1995, the highest rate since 1988, and topped two
percent in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Among the foreign workers in Taiwan, 60 to 70 percent or about 200,000 are
from Thailand, 20 percent are from the Philippines, about 10 percent are
Malaysians, and 10 percent, or 2,000 to 3,000 are Indonesians.  There is a
quota of 8,000 foreign maids in Taiwan, and 4,000 are said to be Indonesians.
The Indonesian government is interested in increasing the number of workers in
Taiwan.  </tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan's Council of Labor Affairs announced that it may reduce the ratio of
foreign to native workers, from the current 35 percent to 30 to 33 percent.
Taiwan grants employers the right to hire foreign workers on an
industry-by-industry basis, and six of the 74 industries approved to hire
foreign workers will lose that right in November 1996. </tt><p>
<tt>On the other hand, a local government announced plans for a 5,500 hectare
industrial park in southwestern Taiwan, noting that the park could accommodate
350,000 people, "including 122,500 foreign workers under the current labor
regulations."</tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan in mid-August announced that foreign professionals and technicians
no longer need permits to come to Taiwan for short working visits--they need
only register with the appropriate government agency.</tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan plans to allow some foreigners to become permanent residents.  A
draft of the immigration law will be submitted to the Cabinet in December
1996.</tt><p>
<tt>On August 15, the Taiwan government announced that new regulations to
protect the rights and interest of foreign domestic workers has been drafted.
Under the proposed rules, foreign maids are given a day off every week, or
overtime pay if they work on their day off.  After one year of work, they are
entitled to a seven-day paid vacation.  Maids be will able to apply for 30 days
of sick leave per year at half pay.  Employers will be required to buy health
insurance policies for maids.  Taiwan has about 30,000 foreign maids, most from
the Philippines. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC24">Israel</a>
and Jordan Debate Foreign
Workers</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>The new Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
attempting to reverse Israel's growing reliance on foreign workers.  A
committee recommended in mid-August that the number of legal work permits be
reduced from 103,000 to 83,000, and that the estimated 50,000 to 150,000
foreigners working with expired tourist permits be apprehended and deported.
</tt><p>
<tt>At its weekly meeting on August 23, the Israeli Cabinet considered a
proposal by the Labor and Welfare Minister to establish an Authority for
Foreign Workers that would have the responsibility of detecting and expelling
1,000 illegal foreign workers each month.  At this rate, authorities estimate
that it would take more than eight years to expel all of the 100,000 foreigners
working in Israel without a permit. </tt><p>
<tt>On July 12, the Jerusalem Post ran a major story headlined "importing
trouble."  Some Israelis warn that there is nothing more permanent than
temporary workers--importing foreign workers may not be reversible, as Israeli
youth abandon farm, construction, and service jobs.  The United Torah Judaism
Party, part of the coalition government, is pushing for the expulsion of
foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The US is pressuring Israel to expel illegal aliens to make room for
Palestinians who need jobs.  After the closure of the West Bank and Gaza in
February 1996, Israel prevented 60,000 Palestinians from working in the
country, and granted work permits to an additional 50,000 foreign workers.
Some 40,000 Palestinians are currently authorized to work in Israel, down from
a peak 180,000 in 1989.</tt><p>
<tt>The Palestinian Authority estimates that each day that Palestinians cannot
work in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza lose $6 million--the 60,000 Palestinians
employed in Israel have a weekly payroll of about $15 million.  Palestinians
say that there were 180,000 commuters to Israel in January 1995, before the
closures began, 100,000 legal workers, and the rest illegal workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The unemployment rate is 65 percent in the Gaza Strip, and 45 percent in
the West Bank. </tt><p>
<tt>In the mid-1980s, there were few  foreign workers (excluding Palestinians)
in Israel, in 1990, 16,000, and in 1996, there are 200,000 to 250,000, half
illegal, and 70 percent in the Tel Aviv area.  In south Tel Aviv, there are
30,000 to 40,000 construction workers from Eastern Europe and Turkey, and they
have average earnings of about $800 per month.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the foreign workers are concentrated in south Tel Aviv, where
overcrowding is common, and both beer halls and brothels have emerged to serve
them.  According to one estimate, 60,000 of Tel Aviv's 440,000 residents are
foreigners (14 percent).</tt><p>
<tt>Israel's state comptroller, Miriam Ben-Porat, asserted that "The practice
of using foreign workers delays technological development and market
optimization, hurts the employment potential of Israelis seeking work, reduces
the need for Israelis to enter into the fields that the foreign workers enter,
and creates a dependence on cheap labor and is bound to create social
problems."</tt><p>
<tt>As the number of foreign workers increases, so do reports of legal migrant
workers switching from the employer who brought them to Israel to jobs that pay
more, and thus a growing number of illegal workers.  In mid-August, it was
reported that there were at least 100,000 illegal foreign workers in Israel,
and the government announced that it was establishing a detention center for
those apprehended.</tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 17,500 Thai workers employed on one-year contracts
in Israeli agriculture--a Thai worker was killed in July 1996 by a Palestinian
allegedly upset about being displaced.  Most of the Thai workers live in mobile
homes, and at least $700 is transferred directly by Israeli farmers to their
Thai workers' accounts at the Bank of Bangkok.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreigners are using a number of ruses to enter Israel in search of work.
One group of Nigerians tried to enter Israel with forged papers indicating that
they were UN peacekeeping troops.</tt><p>
<tt>Under one proposed private employer agreement with the government of Kenya,
for example, up to 15,000 Kenyan workers could come to Israel but, if the
Kenyan worker abandons his job, he will forfeit a $3,000 bond.  If the worker
cannot be found, then the Kenyan government will collect the $3,000 from his
family in Kenya.</tt><p>
<tt>Reports of foreign worker abuse are increasing.  A television report in
mid-August told of six Turkish workers who were locked in a shack on an Israeli
farm by the employer.  Many foreign workers live in squalid housing, which one
police officer likened to a ghetto.  City authorities, especially in Tel Aviv,
complain about the social, health and crime problems created by the foreign
workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are 300,000 Arab and other foreign workers in Jordan, up from 250,000
from 1995, and 10 percent are unemployed.  On August 3, the government
announced plans to tighten controls on foreign workers in the country.  Under
the plan, the passports of foreign workers would be stamped with the name of
the foreigner's Jordanian employer and the duration of the work permit.</tt><p>
<tt>Employers and landlords are required to register foreigners at the local
police station within 48 hours of the foreigners' arrival, or risk fines of
50-100 dinars ($70-$140) per day.</tt><p>
<tt>Work permit fees are being raised from 300 dinars or $520 to 1,200 dinars
or $1,680 to discourage foreign workers from entering Jordan.  The new fees
represent an increase of 10 to 25 percent for Arab laborers in agriculture, 100
to 150 percent for other Arab laborers, and 300 to 400 percent for non-Arab
foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The purpose of the new regulations and fees is to "halt the flow of foreign
labor to create employment opportunities for Jordanian workers."  Unemployment
is officially 15 percent, and informally believed to be at least 30 percent.
About 135,000 persons, 36 percent of all Jordanians, are employed by the
government.</tt><p>
<tt>Jordan plans to introduce a minimum wage, which will be at least the
poverty line, which was 132 dinars ($185) per month in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Many Jordanians work abroad.  In 1990, Saudi Arabia expelled Jordanian
diplomats and migrant workers after Jordan refused to condemn Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.</tt><p>

Foreign Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Foreign workers sent $17.2 billion to their countries of origin in 1995, up
from $15.2 billion in 1994. Between 1990 and 1995, remittances from foreign
workers in Saudi Arabia totaled about $ 100.3 billion, an average of $ 16.7
billion annually.</tt><p>
<tt>In emigration countries such as India, Morocco, Pakistan, Tunisia, Turkey
and Yemen, remittances exceed official development assistance by 20 to 40
percent.  Egypt received $4.7 billion in remittances in 1995, up from $ 4.6
billion in 1994, while Jordan received $1.3 billion in 1995, up from $1.1
billion in 1994.  From 1990 to 1995, Jordan's total hard-currency earnings from
remittances was $ 5.2 billion.</tt><p>
<tt>A new labor law effective at the end of the year in Kuwait requires
employers to pay an annual fee of US $330 for each foreign employee.  The fee
will be paid by the employer, not the employees, and will increase the
ministry's revenue by 60 percent. </tt><p>
<tt>Kuwait had 1.25 million foreigners from 130 countries among its 1.95
million residents in 1995, and 600,000 foreign laborers employed in the private
sector.  Two-thirds of foreign workers are Asian, and one-third are Arab.
About 17 percent of the foreigners in Kuwait were unemployed in 1995, versus
1.4 percent of Kuwaitis.</tt><p>
<tt>Kuwait gives medical tests to the 12,000 incoming foreign workers each
month and, in the first seven months of 1996, some 480 of 89,123 foreign
workers were not allowed to enter because they had "infectious
diseases."</tt><p>
<tt>Kuwait announced after the Gulf War that it would never again allow
foreigners to outnumber natives, and the Kuwaiti government plans to have
Kuwaitis be 50 percent of the population in the year 2000.  However, in 1995,
the 708,000 Kuwaitis were only 36 percent of the population.</tt><p>
<tt>In May 1996, Iraq signed an agreement with the UN that will allow it to
sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months to buy food.  However, 30 percent
of the proceeds from Iraqi oil sales are to go to the UN Compensation
Commission, which is expected to begin dealing with $134 million in claims from
50,000 migrant workers forced to leave Iraq or Kuwait when Iraq invaded in
August 1990--each migrant is expected to receive at least $2,500.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC2">Immigration
Overhaul</a></a></a></h2>
<tt>On September 25, 1996, by a vote of 305 to 123, the House approved a bill
aimed at reducing illegal immigration and reducing access of legal immigrants
to welfare.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the Senate, the immigration bill was included in a spending proposal
needed to fund government operations, and the Clinton administration and
Democratic Senators were thus able to remove several provisions of the
House-passed bill that would have tightened the access of legal immigrants to
welfare services.</tt><p>
<tt>The House on September 28, 1996 approved the final version of the
immigration and budget bill by a vote of 370-37.  The Senate approved the bill
on September 30, 1996 by a vote of 84 to 15.</tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton signed the bill into law immediately. </tt><p>
<tt>Between the first and second House votes, there were intense negotiations
between the White House and Congress over provisions in the bill that would
have made legal immigrants deportable if they received more than 12 months of
welfare benefits, and raised the income needed for US citizens to sponsor their
immediate relatives for admission.  The deportation-for-use-of-benefits
provision was dropped, and the sponsor-income requirement was reduced.</tt><p>
<tt>In a separate vote on September 25, 1996, the House also passed the
Gallegly amendment, which would permit states to deny newly-enrolled K-12
children free public education, by a vote of 254 to 175.  The Senate did not
consider the Gallegly amendment.</tt><p>
<tt>Some commentators saw the new immigration bill as an echo of Proposition
187, the California initiative approved by a 59-41 percent vote in November
1994 that would have created a state-run system to prevent illegal immigrants
from gaining access to social services, including K-12 education.</tt><p>
<tt>Others stressed that the 1996 legislation originated in the budget and law
enforcement committees rather than the immigration committee.  The welfare
overhaul law came from budget committees, and the anti-terrorism law from
enforcement committees.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Provisions.</u>  The immigration bill includes three major sets of
measures to reduce illegal immigration and reduce the access of legal
immigrants to welfare.</tt><p>
<tt>First, it provides for stronger border enforcement, adding 1,000 Border
Patrol agents per year for five years, bringing the total from 5,175 in 1996 to
almost 10,000 by the year 2000.  The new immigration law also requires INS to
build a 14-mile triple fence on the US-Mexican border south of San Diego, and
increases penalties for smuggling aliens into the US and for using false
documents to obtain US jobs or welfare assistance.</tt><p>
<tt>The new law adds 1,200 INS investigators, the agents who inspect US work
places for unauthorized workers, and apprehend and deport criminal
aliens.</tt><p>
<tt>Second, it introduces a pilot telephone verification program to enable
employers to verify the status of newly-hired workers, and social service
agencies to determine the legal status of applicants for benefits.  However,
employer participation in the verification program is voluntary, and no
national worker eligibility verification system that mandates employer
participation could be established without new legislation.</tt><p>
<tt>The Commission on Immigration Reform in 1995 called a mandatory national
verification system "the linchpin" of efforts to reduce illegal immigration.
</tt><p>
<tt>The new law includes incentives for states to develop counterfeit-resistant
driver's licenses and birth certificates.</tt><p>
<tt>The conference committee deleted a provision in the bill that would have
added 350 labor inspectors, and set higher penalties for companies that
repeatedly violate employer sanctions laws.  </tt><p>
<tt>The new legislation makes it easier for employers to defend themselves
against suits from job applicants who believe that they were discriminated
against by employers checking their legal status.  Job applicants who believe
that employers checking their legal status discriminated against them must now
prove that the employer intended to discriminate. </tt><p>
<tt>Third, the immigration bill expands and reinforces restrictions on the
access of LEGAL immigrants to welfare benefits.  Non-US citizens were barred
from Food Stamp assistance and Supplemental Security Income by the welfare law
enacted in August 1996, but that law left it to states to decide whether to
permit legal immigrants to participate in Medicaid, medical assistance for the
poor.</tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton's last minute negotiations preserved the right of states
to offer Medicaid to non-US citizens, including for the treatment of AIDS.
Persons with AIDS are not allowed to immigrate but, once in the US, Medicaid
can pay for their treatment.</tt><p>
<tt>Clinton also got a provision dropped that would have subjected to
deportation immigrants who received means-tested federal welfare assistance,
including AFDC and Medicaid, for more than 12 months during their first seven
years in the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under the House-approved bill, legal immigrants would have been ineligible
for Medicaid benefits during their first five years in the US.  If they applied
in year six, their applications could be rejected if the immigrant's income and
assets together with those of his/her sponsor exceeded certain limits, an
application of "deeming" that the immigrant has access to her sponsor's income
and assets.  Deeming is meant to shift the cost of maintaining needy immigrants
from the taxpayers to the sponsors who agreed to support them in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>To make it less likely that immigrants will request welfare assistance
after their arrival, US sponsors will have to have higher incomes.  </tt><p>
<tt>Sponsors of immigrants now have to have an income at least equal to the
poverty line, $15,569 for a family of four in 1995.  Under the new immigration
law, US citizens who want to bring spouses and minor children into the US will
have to have incomes that are 125 percent of the poverty line, $19,461, down
from 140 percent in the House-approved bill.  Sponsors are allowed to include
the partial value of assets such as cars and homes to reach this
level.<i></i></tt><p>
<tt><i></i>In 1994, about 36 percent of the sponsors of immediate relatives had
incomes that were less than 140 percent of the poverty line, and 44 percent of
those who sponsored parents and adult siblings had incomes less than 200
percent of the poverty line.</tt><p>
<tt>New systems will be put in place to deal with foreigners convicted of
committing crimes in the US, including the establishment of a national database
of such persons.  Foreigners convicted of entering the US illegally, or
overstaying a previous visa, will be denied new visas to enter the US for 10
years.</tt><p>
<tt>An INS officer will decide whether a person seeking asylum at the US border
is granted asylum.  A negative decision would have to be appealed within seven
days to an immigration judge, and then further appeals are possible.</tt><p>
<tt>The chairman of the House immigration subcommittee, Lamar Smith (R-TX),
said that the new immigration bill "secures America's borders, penalizes alien
smugglers, streamlines removal of criminal and illegal aliens and ends
non-citizens' abuse of the welfare system."</tt><p>
<tt>The 13 Democratic legislators on the conference committee were excluded
from the negotiations that settled differences between the House and Senate
bills, and many attacked the conference bill as "fatally flawed."  Among the
provisions subject to such criticism: under the new immigration law, an INS
decision would be reviewed only if the US Supreme Court agreed to consider it,
and the INS would be exempt from environmental laws when building roads and
barriers along the border.</tt><p>
<tt>According to many Democrats, the new immigration law sends the message
that, if a foreigner can get into the US, it will still be easy to find a job,
but it will be more difficult to obtain welfare benefits.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Gallegly amendment</u>.  A 5-4 US Supreme Court decision in 1982, Plyler
v Doe, requires states to provide K-12 education to illegal alien
children.</tt><p>
<tt>California's Proposition 187, if implemented, would end free public
education for illegal alien children, and the Gallegly amendment would have
overturned the Supreme Court decision thus allowing it to happen.</tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton in August 1996 threatened to veto any immigration bill
that would "kick children out of school and onto the streets."  Republican
Presidential candidate Bob Dole, with the urging of California Governor Pete
Wilson, strongly supported the Gallegly amendment, asserting that "the
wonderful California quality of life is being threatened by the flood of
illegal immigration."</tt><p>
<tt>In an attempt to make the amendment acceptable, several modifications were
offered.  Rep Elton Gallegly (R-CA) in August proposed that illegal aliens
currently in K-12 schools could remain in classes, but states would have been
allowed to charge them tuition if they continued from elementary to secondary
school.<b>  </b></tt><p>
<tt>Rep. Brian P. Bilbray (R-CA) offered a compromise on September 12 that
would have left in place the obligation of states to educate illegal alien
children, but would have shifted the cost to the federal government.  The cost
of educating the estimated 700,000 illegal alien children in K-12 US
schools--almost 400,000 in California-- is thought to be about $4 billion per
year.</tt><p>
<tt>On September 24, the Gallegly amendment was modified again to permit
illegal alien children enrolled in US schools on July 1, 1997 to graduate, and
was set for a separate vote.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Road to Reform</u>.  The Immigration Control and Financial
Responsibility Act of 1996 began in the House and Senate in 1995 as
comprehensive bills aimed at reducing illegal and legal immigration, as
recommended by the Commission on Immigration Reform in June, 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>However, the Clinton administration, most Democrats, and interest groups
that ranged from high-tech companies to church groups to ethnic lobbies opposed
reductions in legal immigration, and changes in the legal immigration system
were therefore removed from both bills in Spring 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>On September 11, 1996 the House appointed its 19 members to the
House/Senate conference committee responsible for working out the differences
between the House and Senate immigration bills.  The Senate appointed 11
members in August.</tt><p>
<tt>The conference committee was scheduled to meet on September 17, but the
meeting was canceled because of disagreements between Republicans over the
Gallegly amendment. </tt><p>
<tt>After the conference committee reported the bill, and the House approved
it, the Clinton Administration demanded and secured modifications of the
provisions affecting the access of legal immigrants to welfare benefits in the
Senate.   </tt><p>
<tt><u>What Next?</u>  Most commentaries on the new immigration law were
variations on one of three themes.  First was the party political
interpretation--Republicans closely linked to businesses that benefit from
immigration do not want to really stop the influx, but they do want to prevent
immigrants from gaining access to welfare benefits and schools.</tt><p>
<tt>In Spring 1996, a coalition of immigration admissionists, civil
libertarians, high-tech companies, and libertarian think tanks successfully
opposed proposals originally made by the Commission on Immigration Reform, and
endorsed by the Clinton administration, that would have reduced legal
immigration and imposed new fees on US employers who wanted to bring immigrants
into the US to fill vacant jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Second were accounts that said 1996 marked a tougher attitude on illegal
immigration, and a new skepticism of legal immigration, as exemplified by
Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA), who says that "people want a slowdown" in
immigration.  </tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton and Republican candidate Dole have been sparring in
states such as California and Florida about who is tougher on illegal
immigration.  Clinton touts his administration's addition of Border Patrol
agents, and the streamlining of deportations of criminal aliens.  Dole agrees,
and goes further, arguing states should be allowed to keep illegal alien
children from attending K-12 schools, and favors restricting family unification
to immediate family members. </tt><p>
<tt>Dole does not favor ending the current practice of birthright citizenship,
under which babies born in the US are US citizens, even though ending
birthright citizenship is a plank in the Republican platform.</tt><p>
<tt>Some observers credit Republicans Pete Wilson and Pat Buchanan for laying
the groundwork for stepped up measures against illegal immigration, and for
reduced legal immigration.  These politicians, the argument runs, have
broadened a narrow focus on the economic impacts of immigration to a concern
about broader effects on welfare, language and identity.</tt><p>
<tt>Third are commentaries that say that 1996 showed that the US was getting
tougher on both illegal and legal immigration.  Indeed, many immigrant
admissionists predicted that the next target of restrictionists would be
naturalization, following stories that unqualified immigrants are allowed to
naturalize.</tt><p>
<tt>Finally, some speculate that future immigration policy-making may start
with tough legislation, followed by softer corrective legislation.  </tt><p>
<tt>For example, pressure is building to modify a provision of the
anti-terrorism bill signed into law by President Clinton in April 1996--that
which calls for the deportation of any immigrant who has been convicted of a
felony--"one strike and you're out."  Stories of immigrants who committed
crimes 20 or 40 years earlier, served their sentences, and then became subject
to deportation when they returned from a trip abroad, or otherwise came to the
attention of INS, convinced many people of the need for some
flexibility.</tt><p>
<tt>The anti-terrorism law provides no judicial discretion--there is no appeal
from deportation for convicted immigrant criminals detained by INS.  When
signing the law, President Clinton said that he would send Congress corrective
legislation to permit relief from deportation in some cases.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Naturalization
</a>Controversy</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>In FY96, some 1.1 to 1.2 million immigrants are expected to become American
citizens, more than doubling FY95's record 445,852 naturalizations.  The
previous record was 441,979 naturalizations in 1944.</tt><p>
<tt>Seventy-five percent of the new US citizens are in or near the cities of
New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Miami and Houston, and most are
expected to vote Democratic in 1996 elections. </tt><p>
<tt>There are about eight million immigrants in the US who are eligible to
naturalize.  The INS projects that another 1.1 million foreigners will
naturalize in FY97.  </tt><p>
<tt>The upsurge in naturalizations prompted some Republicans to charge that the
Democratic Clinton administration is cutting corners to get more Democratic
voters.  Each newly-naturalized citizen receives a packet that includes a voter
registration card and a letter from the president.</tt><p>
<tt>The presidential letter begins: "Dear Fellow American:  I want to
congratulate you on reaching the impressive milestone of becoming a citizen of
our great nation.  As you enjoy the benefits of American citizenship and assume
the responsibilities that accompany it, you follow the many brave men and women
who have sacrificed to establish and preserve our democracy over the last two
centuries."</tt><p>
<tt>On September 10, 1996, a US House of Representatives subcommittee held
hearings on allegations that some private firms certified to test the English
skills of applicants for naturalization were approving applicants who could not
speak English.</tt><p>
<tt>Republicans unveiled a memo written by Vice President Gore's office that
says: "INS warns that if we are too aggressive at removing the roadblocks to
[naturalization].... we might be publicly criticized for running a
pro-Democratic voter mill."  </tt><p>
<tt>A Chicago Alderman wrote a letter to Mrs. Clinton urging an accelerated
naturalization program to "provide the Democrats with a strategic advantage" in
the 1996 elections.</tt><p>
<tt>Vice President Gore launched a "Citizenship USA" drive in April 1995,
speeding the elimination of the backlog of 600,000 immigrants who had requested
naturalization, and promising new applicants naturalization within 90
days.</tt><p>
<tt>On September 24, 1996, several Immigration and Naturalization Service
employees testified that the INS was naturalizing immigrants who had committed
crimes in the US, usually a bar to US citizenship.  An INS agent charged that
5,000 of the 60,000 immigrants naturalized during mass ceremonies in Los
Angeles in August 1996 had criminal records.  Since Citizenship USA began, some
327,000 persons have been naturalized in Los Angeles, including 60,000 on
August 7-9 and August 14-16,1996.</tt><p>
<tt>INS officials insisted that such statements were misleading, and that no
more than 69 of the 5,000 immigrants with criminal records would have been
denied naturalization.  Many of the crimes were violations of immigration law,
which the INS does not consider sufficient reason to disqualify applicants from
US citizenship.  </tt><p>
<tt>INS promised to revoke the US citizenship of anyone naturalized improperly,
although the INS admitted on September 25 that because it had not yet decided
what procedures to use, it had not yet taken back the citizenship of anyone
improperly naturalized in Los Angeles in 1996.  The INS denaturalized through
federal courts 15 people in FY94, 11 in FY95, and two people in FY96.</tt><p>
<tt>On September 26, California's Secretary of State ordered county voter
registrars not to permit non-citizens to vote in the November 1996 elections,
after it was revealed that 727 non- citizens in Los Angeles county had filled
out the voter registration form attached to the driver's license application
under the new "motor voter" law.  </tt><p>
<tt>In applying for the license, they had signed the form on which the
signatory asserts, under penalty of perjury, that he/she is a US citizen at
least 18 years old and thus eligible to vote.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS is drafting regulations for "administrative denaturalizations" that
are possible within one year of naturalization.  Under the draft regulations,
newly naturalized citizens who are accused of concealing criminal records will
be given 30 days to respond to the charges.</tt><p>
<tt>There are many explanations for the upsurge in naturalizations.  One factor
often cited is the passage of Prop. 187 in November 1994 in California,
followed by the August 1996 welfare law that makes many legal immigrants
ineligible for welfare benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>A second factor was the INS requirement that many immigrants had to visit
INS to replace their old green cards.  They were reminded that, for $20 more,
the immigrant could become a naturalized US citizen.  </tt><p>
<tt>A third factor which will remove a deterrent to naturalization is Mexico's
pending introduction of dual citizenship--Mexican-born persons are about
one-fourth of US immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>The rush of new voters may not change the political dynamics of immigrant
districts.   The 33rd Congressional District in southeast Los Angeles County,
represented by Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-CA), has had the fewest registered
voters of any US Congressional District--76 percent of the registered voters in
this district are Democratic, and newly-naturalized citizens are registering
Democratic at a 2 to 1 rate.</tt><p>
<tt>In a September 1, 1996 speech to the United Farm Workers convention,
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros asserted that 70 percent
of the legal immigrants who would lose benefits under the new welfare law were
eligible to become US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>About 300,000, one-fourth of all immigrants naturalizing in FY96, will be
given tests in English and history by private firms rather than the INS.  One
private firm, Naturalization Assistance Services, is accused of "guaranteeing"
that the immigrant passes the test in exchange for a $850 fee.  The INS closed
25 private centers that provided naturalization services for a fee in 1995,
including 17 operated by Naturalization Assistance Services.</tt><p>
<tt>Some of the NAS graduates reportedly did not understand the instruction to
"please take your seat" at their naturalization ceremony.</tt><p>
<tt>On September 17, more than 10,000 immigrants were sworn in as US citizens
in Dallas, Texas, the largest-ever naturalization ceremony in Texas.  During
the ceremony, a plane carrying a banner with the note "Felicidades.  Vota
Dole-Kemp," flew overhead.  Texas is considered a critical state for
Republicans in the November election.  About half of the immigrants sworn in
were Mexican.  </tt><p>
<tt>Santa Clara county, which includes Silicon Valley, hired a "naturalization
czar" to coordinate the activities of community-based organizations and
volunteers who are helping some of the 18,000 eligible immigrants to
naturalize.  County officials believe they are the first in the nation to
approve such a program.  A naturalization ceremony in San Jose, California was
held September 18 for 11,000 immigrants from 104 countries.</tt><p>
<tt>If Mexican immigrants naturalize in great numbers, it will mark a change:
The INS in 1992 reported that only 17 percent of the Mexicans who entered the
US legally in 1977 sought to become naturalized citizens during the next 15
years. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">Welfare
Changes
Implemented</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of
1996, scheduled to go into full effect on October 1, 1996, makes most legal and
illegal immigrants ineligible for welfare assistance.  To obtain maximum
federal payments, states have an incentive to implement the new welfare law as
quickly as possible.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated one million legal immigrants, including 400,000 in California,
are expected to lose about $4 billion per year welfare benefits they are now
receiving, an average $4,000 each.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the bill, foreigners are grouped into three major categories for the
purpose of determining their access to welfare assistance:</tt><p>
<tt>-Legal immigrants who have worked in the US for at least 40 quarters (10
years), are veterans or members of the Armed Forces, or have been admitted as
refugees, retain access to welfare as before.</tt><p>
<tt>- "qualified aliens,"--most legal immigrants--are not eligible for specific
means-tested federal benefit programs for a five-year period after their entry
into the United States.</tt><p>
<tt>-"non-qualified aliens" are unauthorized or illegal aliens and some
categories of non-immigrants who have INS permission to remain in the US, such
as aliens with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or Persons Residing under Color
of Law (PRUCOL).  They are not eligible for most federal public benefits, or
for many state and local public benefits. </tt><p>
<tt>The assistance programs to which legal immigrants continue to gain access
are primarily those that deliver in-kind services, such as soup kitchens, or
those that provide emergency help, such as violence and abuse prevention
programs.</tt><p>
<tt>Courts may slow the removal of immigrants from welfare programs, since
lawyers are preparing to sue states as they remove immigrants from the welfare
rolls.  A major argument will be that the new welfare law unconstitutionally
discriminates against a class of people -- immigrants who have not become
citizens -- when it cuts off their Supplemental Security Income and food stamp
benefits.  Under the 14th Amendment to the US constitution, the equal
protection under the law amendment, governments may not discriminate on the
basis of, inter alia, national origin.</tt><p>
<tt>The new welfare and immigration laws include provisions that ALLOW state
and local government employees to report to INS illegal aliens who seek police
or medical assistance, or education for their children; this provision
invalidates the ordinances passed by many "sanctuary" cities that prohibit
their employees from reporting suspected illegal aliens to the INS.  </tt><p>
<tt>California Governor Pete Wilson issued instructions to have  in the welfare
law that allows city workers to have state agencies comply with this provision
as soon as possible.</tt><p>
<tt>New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced on September 30, 1996 that New
York City would sue the federal government, arguing that the new welfare law
violates the due process rights of immigrants, since it requires immigrants to
pay taxes, but denies them welfare benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>Welfare benefits have been reduced for all US residents, and cash
assistance to eligible poor people is no longer an entitlement: "Effective Oct.
1, 1996, no individual or family shall be entitled to any benefits or services
under any state plan."  However, there is some discretion in how states devise
new ways to help the poor; states are required to file plans with the US
Secretary of Health and Human Services that outline how they will help the
poor.</tt><p>
<tt>New computer systems will have to be developed in order to implement the
new welfare law.  For example, the new law limits an individual to a maximum
five years of support, so to prevent persons from obtaining five years of
benefits in one state, and then moving to another to obtain more benefits,
state computer systems will have to be linked to a national system.</tt><p>
<tt>One provision of the new welfare law requires the federal government to set
up a system within 18 months to verify the citizenship status of applicants for
assistance.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Food Stamps.</u>  More immigrants receive assistance under Food Stamps
than any other welfare program, and the ban on immigrants receiving Food Stamps
produced considerable confusion in state governments  </tt><p>
<tt>In most states, immigrants applying for Food Stamps for the first time near
the end of September 1996 were rejected.  In California, new Food Stamp
applications from legal immigrants were rejected after September 23, 1996.
However, in other states, there was confusion, as intake workers in some states
accepted applications, and in others did not.</tt><p>
<tt>There was even more variance in how states treated immigrants whose need
for Food Stamps was being re-certified.  President Clinton directed USDA to
permit all states to keep immigrants currently on Food Stamp rolls until August
22, 1997, one year after the welfare law was signed.</tt><p>
<tt>However, states may remove legal immigrants from Food Stamp rolls when
their eligibility is re-verified, and there was uncertainty as to whether to
wait for the normal eligibility review, which could permit some immigrants to
receive food stamps through September 1997, or to review the legal status of
recipients sooner.</tt><p>
<tt>California has 3.2 million Food Stamp recipients, including 436,000 legal
immigrants.  They currently receive benefits worth an average of $182 per
month.  About 373,000 immigrants will not be eligible for the program once the
welfare law is implemented.  </tt><p>
<tt>California had 2.7 million people receiving AFDC in June 1996, including
390,000 or 15 percent non-US citizens.  There were also 379,000 non-US citizens
receiving SSI payments, and 258,0000, or two-thirds, are expected to be
declared ineligible.</tt><p>
<tt>In the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, an estimated one of every 12 to 15
people is a legal immigrant who stands to lose food stamps under the new
welfare law.  The unemployment rate in the Rio Grande Valley is typically 15 to
20  percent, making it doubtful that those who lose Food Stamps can increase
their earnings to make up for the lost benefits.  </tt><p>
<tt>The state of Texas estimates that about 187,000 legal immigrants will lose
food stamps, 22,000 will lose welfare benefits, and 53,160 will be cut off from
Supplemental Security Income.</tt><p>
<tt>New Jersey has announced that the 21,000 legal immigrants in the state
getting Food Stamps will continue to receive them for at least six
months.</tt><p>
<tt>Governor Christine Todd Whitman also announced that New Jersey intends to
provide some cash, medical, and disability benefits to legal immigrants with
state funds after immigrants are removed from federal programs, leading some to
speculate that immigrants needing such services will move to states such as New
Jersey.  About 15,000 legal immigrants receive cash assistance in New Jersey,
50,000 receive Medicaid, and 25,000 get SSI payments.</tt><p>
<tt>Governor Parris N. Glendening said that Maryland will assume the cost of
welfare benefits for immigrants when they are removed from the federal rolls.
Maryland estimates that it will cost the state about $9 million a year to
continue benefits to 2,155 legal immigrants.  The state will not pick up the
cost of Food Stamps, estimated at nearly $10 million, but will subsidize food
stamps for 2,217 immigrant children.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, for the first time, the percentage of Hispanics in poverty, 30.3
percent, exceeded the share of Blacks in poverty, 29.3 percent.  The immigrant
welfare restrictions are expected to increase Hispanic poverty.  For more
information, see http://www.census.gov/prod/www/titles.html</tt><p>
<tt><u>Employer Reactions</u>.  A few employers are reportedly worried that
some of the 2.3 million working Americans who receive Food Stamps might expect
higher wages if they no longer qualify for Food Stamps.  US citizens with three
dependents can qualify for Food Stamps if they earn less than $17,000 per
year.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington,
employers thought more about the additional workers who would be available when
the new welfare law required people to go to work than about the loss of the
subsidies to employers provided by Food Stamps and other indirect welfare
programs.  A "large percentage" of the 5,600 entry-level restaurant workers in
the Washington area, who start at $6.25 per hour, are immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>At Marriott, where hourly workers earn an average $7 an hour, or $14,560 a
year, some hotels are helping immigrants to become naturalized citizens by
offering citizenship classes.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Other Programs</u>.  Lawyers for California Governor Wilson argued that
the federal judge who prevented the implementation of Prop. 187 in November
1995 should now permit California to begin implementing some of the
initiative's provisions because of the new welfare law.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about six million legal immigrants in California who are not US
citizens.  Of these, 1.1 million currently receive benefits under the Medi-Cal
program.  (Medi-Cal is funded by the state and federal governments, and
provides health coverage for roughly six million poor Californians, almost 20
percent of all residents--those eligible must have family incomes below $23,634
for a family of three in 1996.  Illegal aliens are not eligible for Medi-Cal
coverage).  </tt><p>
<tt>Many of these legal immigrants might become US citizens to retain their
eligibility for Medi-Cal.  The US Congressional Budget Office assumes that
one-third of California's 1.1 million legal non-citizens on Medi-Cal will
become citizens in order to remain eligible for benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>A California Assembly committee in mid-July criticized the INS for
"dumping" illegal immigrants in San Diego area hospitals to avoid paying for
their care.  According to critics, Operation Gatekeeper has led to more
injuries to illegal immigrants, and prompted the INS to take injured aliens to
area hospitals before determining their immigrant status.  If an alien is not
formally in INS custody, the costs of health care are borne by the local
government/hospital, and not by INS.</tt><p>
<tt>As a result of the new welfare law, 200 severely disabled illegal
immigrants under 24-hour care in California nursing homes--at a daily cost of
$73 per day, and an annual cost of $5 to $6 million-- will no longer have their
bills paid, despite an effort by Governor Wilson to persuade the Legislature to
extend their care in August.  Some in the Legislature refused to approve
extended care because they thought such an extension would conflict with Prop.
187.</tt><p>
<tt>Since 1988, severely disabled illegal immigrants and pregnant illegal
immigrant women in California have received state-subsidized care under a bill
signed by Republican Governor George Deukmejian.  Wilson ordered the prenatal
care for illegal alien women halted as soon as possible.</tt><p>
<tt>There are also 14,000 to 15,000 legal immigrants now receiving care in
California long-term or nursing facilities.</tt><p>
<tt>New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on September 11 promised not to
implement the provision of the new welfare law that permits city employees to
report to INS illegal immigrants who seek services like police protection,
hospital care and public education.  Giuliani is described as a "national
spokesperson" for immigrants--the Republican mayor of Democratic New York City
who believes that high levels of immigration are good for New York and the US.
</tt><p>
<tt>Since 1985, New York City has prohibited its 200,000 employees from
reporting any of the 400,000 suspected illegal aliens to the INS.</tt><p>
<tt>On September 30, 1996, George Soros announced a $50 million gift to the
newly established Emma Lazarus Fund to provide grants to community groups that
could use it, for example, to pay an immigrant's $95 citizenship application
fee or to provide the English-language instruction needed for
naturalization.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">Mexico</a>:
Polls, Remittances and Economy</a>
</a></h2>
<tt><u>Polls.</u>  An August 1996 Los Angeles Times poll of 1,500 Mexicans in
Mexico and 1,572 US adults found that 73 percent of those interviewed in Mexico
had never been to the US.  Of the Mexicans who had visited the US, only 34
percent had "had a job" in the US.  The US poll was conducted by telephone,
while the Mexican poll was done in person, and 28 percent of the Mexican
interviews were conducted in towns with 2,500 or fewer residents.</tt><p>
<tt>A total of 20 percent of the Mexican respondents said that they would seek
a job in the US in the next 12 months; seven percent said it was very likely,
and 13 percent responded that it was somewhat likely that they would head for
the US in search of work.  </tt><p>
<tt>Each one percent of those polled represents almost one million Mexicans,
suggesting that almost seven million Mexicans would say, if asked, that they
are very likely to seek US jobs in the next 12 months.  There were about 4.1
million Mexican-born workers in the US labor force of 132 million in November
1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Over half of the Mexicans interviewed in Mexico said they had a family
member living in the US, but only nine percent said that their household gets
money from relatives in the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>An August 1989 poll of nearly 2,000 Mexicans found that 30 percent had a
relative living in the US, and seven percent reported that they received funds
from a relative in the US.  In 1989, about 22 percent of the respondents
reported that they were very (six percent) or fairly likely (16 percent) to
move to the US within 12 months, which was interpreted to suggest that IRCA was
not deterring Mexican migrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 95 percent of Mexicans said they were living in an economic crisis,
and almost two-thirds of Mexicans said their personal economic situation is
worse than it was three years ago.  When asked what could reduce illegal
immigration, 84 percent of Mexicans said jobs and economic development in
Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt>Americans, by contrast, put the emphasis on enforcement.  Slightly more
said that stricter border control (19 percent) and workplace enforcement (18
percent) are needed to reduce illegal immigration than agreed that jobs and
economic development in Mexico can slow emigration (38 percent).</tt><p>
<tt>Mexicans tend to view the United States far more favorably than Americans
view Mexico, but the percentage of Mexicans who view Americans favorably has
fallen since 1991.  According to Jorge G. Castaneda, one reason for the decline
is that Mexicans have not found it easier to work legally in the US:  "The main
reason most Mexicans supported NAFTA, for example, was they felt it would help
them work in the United States. And that, of course, hasn't happened."</tt><p>
<tt>About three-fourths of the Mexicans said that NAFTA has been bad for them
personally or has had no effect on their economic status.  A majority of
Americans polled believe that NAFTA has resulted in the loss of US jobs.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Remittances</u>.  Mexicans in the US send home an estimated $4 to $6
billion per year, much of it through Denver-based First Data Corp., which owns
Western Union and Moneygram.  First Data is affiliated with Elektra, an
electronics, home appliance and furniture chain that is an agent for Western
Union in Mexico.  </tt><p>
<tt>Western Union charges $29 to send the average remittance of $300 within 15
minutes, and Elektra charges about a 10 percent fee to convert the dollars into
pesos--in September 1996, Elektra offered 6.75 pesos per dollar when the
exchange rate was 7.5 pesos per dollar.  Despite these hefty fees, many
Mexicans use wire transfers because of high Mexican bank charges for cashing
non-customers' checks. </tt><p>
<tt>Banco de Mexico estimates that Mexico received $3.67 billion in remittances
in 1995, slightly below the level of 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Electronic transfers and competition may improve the exchange rate obtained
by Mexicans--only 30 to 50 percent of all remittances are transferred
electronically today.  The U.S. Postal Service in August 1996 launched a Dinero
Seguro service that permits up to $3000 from any US Post Office to any of 900
branches of Mexico's Bancomer bank--the sender is charged $26 to send
$300.</tt><p>
<tt>Wells Fargo offers a similar system with Banamex.  World Center Video
Conferences is proposing a service that includes a brief video visit between
the money sender and recipients in Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Economy.</u>  President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon delivered his
second State of the Nation (Informe) speech on September 1, 1996, and pledged
to work for equality before the law:  "the law applies to everyone alike."  In
a reference to the US, Zedillo said that "the Mexican government will always
demand respect for the rights of our countrymen abroad."</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's economy grew 7.2 percent in the second quarter of 1996, versus a
10 percent contraction in the same quarter of 1995, and unemployment fell to
5.8 percent, versus 7.3 percent in summer 1995.  Exports rose 22 percent, as
did the peso.  Grupo Modelo, maker of Corona beer, has increased exports to the
US so much that it is planning a $400 million brewery in Zacatecas.  </tt><p>
<tt>Zedillo predicted on September 1 that Mexico's economy would grow by four
percent in 1997.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's National Statistics Institute (INEGI) reported September 3 that
the number of maquiladora employees surpassed 750,000 for the first time in
June 1996, up almost 20 percent since June 1995.  Maquiladora jobs are
concentrated in five northern Mexican states: Chihuahua, 29 percent of
maquiladora jobs; Baja California, 21 percent; Tamaulipas, 17 percent; and,
Coahuila and Sonora, eight percent each.</tt><p>
<tt>At the end of September, the Alliance for Economic Recovery (ARE)--key
business, labor and agricultural leaders--agreed to a new pacto that called for
wage increases of 20 percent.  Mexican social security workers won a 25 percent
pay increase in September 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Non-maquiladoras recently surpassed maquiladoras as the top source of
Mexico's manufacturing exports.  Many of the manufacturing conglomerates based
in Monterrey saw their exports boosted by the devaluation, since they had
already reduced employment to cut costs.  Alfa, for example, reduced employment
from 50,000 in 1982 to 24,000 in 1996, and doubled its exports of steel,
chemicals and other products to $1.1 billion in 1995 versus 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>However, an August 5 Wall Street Journal article praising policymakers for
not backsliding on economic reform--and thus laying the basis for higher
savings and more productive investments-- also warned that, "in the next two
years, at least, the outlook is for high unemployment and stagnant
salaries...and a higher incidence of poverty."</tt><p>
<tt>President Zedillo said that Mexico must depend on internal savings for
investment, ensuring that it will be years before wages and incomes recover for
most Mexicans.  Zedillo said that export-led growth will prompt more local and
foreign investment, and that increased investment will eventually increase
consumption and local demand.</tt><p>
<tt>A Banamex survey of INEGI of manufacturing labor market data reported that
2.9 million paid workers were employed in Mexico's non-maquiladora
manufacturing sector in 1993.  According to Banamex, the 1995 economic crisis
was unusual because Mexican companies responded by eliminating jobs, as well as
by reducing real wages.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 26, Mexico announced that it would repay $7 billion of the
remaining $10.5 billion that it borrowed from the US in 1995, leaving Mexico
with $3.5 billion in debt from the $12.5 billion borrowed from the US in
1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Over 100,000 Mexicans looking for jobs from the country's interior have
flooded Mexico's northern border region.  About 60,000  have found work in
Tijuana's maquiladora factories.  The city's population growth rate is now five
percent annually, double the rate for the whole country and very difficult on
the city's infrastructure.  Luckily, the workers streaming from the south are
finding work, the unemployment rate in Tijuana is two percent. </tt><p>
<tt>Maquiladoras have added 170,000 jobs since 1995 and the start of the North
American Free Trade Agreement.  Two-thirds of the jobs are filled by Mexicans
from Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz and other southern states.  Forty percent of the
workforce is male and employee turnover continues to be high, eight percent per
month on average.  </tt><p>
<tt>By June 30, 1996, about 78,000 US workers had qualified for a US-government
program to help find new jobs to replace jobs because of NAFTA.  Some 8,000 US
residents commute to jobs in Mexican maquiladoras every day.</tt><p>
<tt>On a scale of 0 to 10, a ranking of 54 countries for how corruption "is
affecting commercial and social life" found that New Zealand and Denmark were
least corrupt, and Nigeria and Pakistan were most corrupt.  Mexico ranked 38 of
the 54 countries, less corrupt than Brazil and Colombia, but more corrupt than
Argentina (http://www.uni-goettingen.de/~uwvw/icr.htm)</tt><p>
<tt>In late August, President Zedillo promised National Campesino Confederation
(CNC) President Beatriz Paredes Rangel that the government would clear up land
titles for peasants by the end of 1997, under the so-called Program to Certify
Communal Land Rights (Procede).</tt><p>
<tt>Agriculture continues to suffer and shrink, with an estimated 500,000 to
750,000 subsistence farmers leaving agriculture since 1990.  On July 24, 1996,
Mexico announced a ten-year 15 billion peso ($2 billion) program to relieve
indebted farmers of some of their debt.  Farmers monthly payments on debts up
to 500,000 pesos ($66,000) will be reduced by about 40 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>The estimated 20,000 Mixtec migrant farm workers from Oaxaca and Guerrero
in Baja California reportedly are paid 35 pesos a day, a little under $5, or
about 60 cents an hour.  In July, some of them rioted in San Quintin after they
did not receive their weekly pay.</tt><p>
<tt>In mid-August, Sanyo announced that it was paying $2 million in ransom to
the kidnappers of one of its San Diego-based executives who was abducted in
Tijuana.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Mexicans Abroad.</u>  On July 30, 1996, Mexico's Congress approved a
package of 17 constitutional amendments and implementing laws that aim to
reduce electoral fraud and permit Mexicans living abroad to cast absentee
ballots in the presidential election in the year 2000.  The Mexican Senate
approved the changes by a 124-0 vote on August 2, and they now go to Mexico's
31 state legislatures for approval.</tt><p>
<tt>When 21-- two-thirds of the state legislatures in Mexico-- approve the
proposed voting changes, they can go into effect.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party held its 17th convention
in September in Mexico City.  Most US newspapers said that it heralded the
return of the PRI's old guard anti-reformer "dinosaurs" to power within the
party.  For example, the 4,400 delegates approved a rule that, in 2000, the
PRI's  nominee for president must have held elective office and have been a
party member for at least 10 years.  If this rule had been in effect, the last
five PRI candidates and Mexican presidents would have been disqualified.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Guerrillas and Drugs.</u>  In late August, the Popular Revolutionary
Army (EPR) launched simultaneous raids in Guerrero, Oaxaca, and Chiapas that
left 13 dead.  As a result, Mexico's army became more involved in internal
security in September 1996 than at any time since the 1930s.  The EPR is the
armed wing of the Clandestine Worker's Revolutionary Party of the Poor
(PROCUP), which announced itself June 28, 1996 in Aguas Blancas at the one-year
commemorative service for 17 campesinos slain by Guerrero police.</tt><p>
<tt>Despite the economic crisis, Mexico expanded its troops by 15 percent to
180,000, and increased military spending a similar percentage to $2 billion.
Many of the soldiers are draftees from poor families, performing one year of
mandatory service.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico continues to be criticized in the US for doing to little to prevent
the flow of drugs across the southern border.  Since November 1993, the US has
shifted its drug interdiction resources from the Mexican border to other areas,
and Mexico has assumed the primary responsibility for preventing drug
cultivation and smuggling into the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has not done the job.  In 1995, an estimated 210 tons of cocaine
entered the US from Mexico, the most ever, while drug arrests and seizures in
Mexico declined.</tt><p>
<tt>A former insider in one Mexican drug cartel testified that the cartel used
INS buses to ship drugs into the US between 1986 and 1990.  The drugs were
placed  on buses used to transport illegal immigrants captured in southern
Texas to Houston, where they were flown to their homelands.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC6">INS</a>
Enforcement</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) announced on September 5
that a series of worksite enforcement operations at 487 businesses in 13
central U.S. states between July 21 and August 30 resulted in the detention of
3,679 unauthorized alien workers.<b>  </b>The number of aliens apprehended by
state was: Texas (2,097); New Mexico (483); Minnesota (243); Iowa (209);
Wisconsin (129); Wyoming (120); Illinois (116); Oklahoma (103); Kansas (76);
Indiana (58); Montana (31); Missouri (9); and South Dakota (5).  The aliens
detained were from twelve countries including: Mexico (3,590); El Salvador
(50); Honduras (21); and Guatemala (8).</tt><p>
<tt>The cover story of the September 23, 1996 US News &amp; World Report, "The
New Jungle," focused on the use of illegal immigrant workers in the Storm Lake,
Iowa pork processing plant.  The story emphasized the role of meat packing
companies in recruiting immigrant workers, and said that "perhaps no industry
is so dependent on this low-wage labor as the nation's meat and poultry
companies."</tt><p>
<tt>The INS district director for Iowa and Nebraska estimates that 25 percent
of the workers in those plants in the 220 meat packing plants in the two states
are unauthorized aliens.  INS inspections of the workers in 15 plants since
1992 have led to 1,000 workers.</tt><p>
<tt>At a July 1996 conference of social scientists on "The Changing Face of
Rural America," it was noted that in most Midwestern meat packing plants,
Latinos work alongside US-born Blacks and whites.  Latinos are less than half
of most plant's work forces, and many of them are US-born citizens.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many Latinos move to the Midwest because, unlike seasonal farm jobs in
California, where workers average 1,000 hours at $5 to $6 per hour, workers in
meat packing plants average 2,000 hours at $6 to $7 per hour, enough to support
a family.  The Changing Face report is available at<b>
</b>http://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/iow.htm</tt><p>
<tt>The enforcement operations included an August 25 sweep in Jackson, Wyoming
that resulted in the detention of 150 foreigners, one percent of the county's
labor force.  Some employers are calling for an investigation of the INS raids,
which they called racially motivated and dehumanizing because all those
detained were Latino, and some were transported to jail in a horse trailer.
</tt><p>
<tt>The police, who joined with federal INS agents in the raid, defended the
sweep as a needed response to complaints of automobile accidents and drug
dealing linked to unauthorized workers.  Supporters of the aliens countered
that one of the workers detained reportedly shook President Clinton's hand when
he vacationed in Jackson.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS detained 124 of the 1,200 workers at two plants of poultry
processor Allen Family Foods in Maryland in late August.  Eight poultry
processing firms employ 14,000 workers in the Delmarva area.  Most workers
begin at $6 per hour, and rise to a maximum of $7 per hour.  Turnover is high;
for every 100 jobs, 180 to 200 workers are hired each year.</tt><p>
<tt>An analysis of INS apprehension data between 1976 and 1995 concluded that
each additional three to four hours of border agent time increased by one the
number of aliens apprehended along the US-Mexican border.  The same study
suggested that each 10 percent decrease in Mexican wages increased
apprehensions by eight percent.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of apprehensions rose from 1.1 million in FY94 to 1.4 million in
FY95, or 27 percent, after the Mexican peso was devalued by over 50 percent.
In FY96, there were about 5,100 Border Patrol agents, and the cost of border
enforcement activities was about $600 million.</tt><p>
<tt>In Texas, INS announced in September the establishment of an Institutional
Hearing Program that stations INS officers at the Huntsville prison, so that
deportable aliens are removed from the US as soon as they finish their
sentences.  About 10 percent of the 128,000 prisoners in Texas were born
outside the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS will have a budget of $3.1 billion in FY97.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Canadian
Immigrants</a></></a></h2>
<tt>Canada is expected to add 220,000 immigrants to its 30 million population
in 1996, a much higher rate of immigration than the US, which is expecting to
add about 800,000 immigrants to its 265 million population.</tt><p>
<tt>Vancouver, a city of 1.6 million, is Canada's fastest growing city, with
40,000 immigrants and Canadians moving to the city each year.  The number of
Asians living in Vancouver doubled between 1971 and 1991, and 20,000 Asian
immigrants arrived in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>One report says that Taipei's ten richest people have established homes in
Vancouver, and pumped more than US$653 million into the local economy.</tt><p>
<tt>Many Asians prefer to migrate to Canada rather than the US, both because
they feel it is safer, and because Canada permits naturalization after three
years rather than five.  Many of the Asians are wealthy and want the security
of a Canadian passport--one estimate is that 80 percent of the Vancouver homes
that sold for $1 million or more in 1995 were sold to Asian immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 2,000 Chilean tourists sought asylum in Canada between March and June
1996, a period when Canada removed visa requirements for Chilean tourists.
Canada re-imposed visa requirements on Chile in June.</tt><p>
<tt>Representatives of the Canadian and Manitoba governments visited Scotland
in early July to encourage the immigration of skilled workers to Manitoba.
According to a government spokesperson, Manitoba has a shortage of skilled
computer workers.  Scots interested in emigrating to Canada must have one year
of experience in their occupation, a high level of education and fluency in
French or English.</tt><p>
<tt>A Canadian immigration lawyer in the New York Times on September 16, 1996
decried what he called the push for "designer immigrants" in Canada--the highly
skilled selected on the basis of a point system for their education and
skills.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC9">Germany</a>
Begins to Return Bosnians</a>
</a></h2>
<tt><u>Ex-Yugoslavia</u>.  Germany plans to begin returning 320,000 persons to
Bosnia-Herzegovina on October 1, 1996, in a process that will continue through
1997. The first Bosnians to be returned will be single adults and childless
couples; those resisting voluntary repatriation face deportation.  An estimated
60 percent of the Bosnians in Germany are Muslim.</tt><p>
<tt>Bosnian Muslims who come from areas "cleansed" by Serbs will not be
returned to Serb areas.  </tt><p>
<tt>The interior ministers of the 16 states handle the return of foreigners to
their countries of origin, so that there is likely to be state-to-state
variation in how Bosnians are returned.  Baden Wurtemberg plans to send letters
in early October to some Bosnians, telling them to that their "toleration
permits" to remain in Germany  expire on December 15, 1996.  Hessen, on the
other hand, has said that there will be no repatriations until April 1,
1997.</tt><p>
<tt>Berlin's Interior Minister, for example, said that Bosnians in Berlin must
realize that "our hospitality is coming to an end and that they must go home
voluntarily."</tt><p>
<tt>Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that, instead of spending DM15 billion on
Bosnians in Germany , it makes "more sense to send them home and to spend the
money on reconstruction."</tt><p>
<tt>Of the 687,000 Bosnians who left the former Yugoslavia, about 320,000 are
in Germany, 122,000 are in Sweden, and 80,000 are in Austria.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in September 1996 signed a
separate agreement for the return of another 120,000 Serbian refugees--mostly
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo-- currently living in Germany.  Most are expected
to return in 1997-98.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Asylum</u>.  Some 9,548 foreigners applied for asylum in Germany in
August, 1996, bringing the total for 1996 to 76,000, compared with 80,500 for
the first eight months of 1995.  Of the 13,000 cases decided in August, about
900, or seven percent of the foreigners who applied, were granted refugee
status in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>A Togo man was removed forcibly by Bavarian police from an Adventist church
in Wunsiedel, Bavaria and flown home, signaling a tough state policy toward
"church asylum."  The church gave the man sanctuary in March.  About 60
foreigners whose applications for asylum in Germany have been rejected are
being sheltered in churches in Bavaria. </tt><p>
<tt>There were calls for the resignation of the Bavarian interior minister for
breaking a promise not to enter church grounds to expel an asylum-seeker.
</tt><p>
<tt>Germany spent DM5.5 billion on asylum seekers in 1995, about the same as in
1994.</tt><p>
<tt>On September 16, 1996, the trial started for Safwan Eid, a Lebanese asylum
seeker charged with burning a Hamburg foreigners' hostel on January 18, 1996.
Ten foreigners were killed, and 38 injured.  Demonstrators convinced that
neo-Nazis set the fire protested outside the courtroom.</tt><p>
<tt>The Eid family--parents and three children in Germany, and two grown
children still in Lebanon-- spent $15,000 to be smuggled to Germany, admittedly
as economic migrants.  Their asylum applications were rejected, but they were
allowed to stay in Germany because Lebanon refused to take them back.</tt><p>
<tt>In September, 1996, 12 neo-Nazi youth were arrested for attacking
foreigners' hostels in August in the former east German state of Saxony.  There
were 165 violent attacks on foreigners in Germany in the first six months of
1996, down almost 50 percent from the same period in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on September 9 assured visiting
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy that Germany would continue to accept
Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union.  In 1990, Chancellor Kohl made
an agreement with German-Jewish leaders to permit immigration to rebuild the
aging Jewish community, and 45,000 Jews have so far immigrated under the open
immigration program.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Der Speigel, some 80,000 visas have been approved for Jewish
immigrants so far, and an estimated hundreds of thousands of Jews in the
ex-USSR are waiting in line to move to Germany.  German Development Aid
Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger earlier in 1996 said that, since Jewish
immigration is not limited, there is the potential for conflict between Israel
and Germany over the Ukraine's 800,000 Jews.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Border Controls</u>.  Germany has 5,700 agents to guard its eastern
borders, and another 500 are scheduled to join them in 1997.  In 1995, they
apprehended and returned about 30,000 foreigners to Poland and the Czech
Republic.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Vietnamese</u>.  On September 17, the first chartered flight returned
239 Vietnamese to Vietnam, the first returns since Germany and Vietnam signed a
repatriation agreement on September 21, 1995 that anticipates the return of
40,000 Vietnamese by 2000.  About 657 Vietnamese have been returned from
Germany to Hanoi on regularly-scheduled flights.  </tt><p>
<tt><u>Labor Market</u>.  Hans Peter Stihl, a spokesperson for employers, urged
the German government to make it easier to employ foreign workers from
countries to which Germany exports its goods.  According to Stihl, Germany
should make it easier for foreign students to enter Germany from developing
countries and to stay in Germany after they have completed their
studies.</tt><p>
<tt>During the 1960s and 1970s, unemployment rates in western Europe were
typically half those in the US.  In the 1980s, this relationship reversed, and
today the US unemployment rate is half the German unemployment rate of 10
percent.</tt><p>
<tt>The unemployment rate is 15 percent in the former East Germany, and nine
percent in the former West Germany.  A number of employment subsidies,
Arbeitsbeschaffungsmassmahmen, are being curtailed to save money--these
subsidies amounted to DM2.6 billion ($1.7 billion) in the West, and DM7.2
billion ($4.7 billion) in the East.</tt><p>
<tt>The Federal Labor Office, in another study, attacked a favorite union
proposal for job creation--ban overtime.  According to the Labor Office, only
about 10 percent of the overtime hours would be used to create 85,000
additional jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany is in the lead among European countries in reducing social welfare
benefits.  For example, about 92 percent of Germans with monthly incomes of
less than DM580, are enrolled in 850 Krankenkasse (sickness funds).  The
Krankenkasse allocate a fixed amount of money to regional associations of
doctors, which reimburse individual doctor-members according to their work as
measured in points.  A house call, for example, earns a doctor 400 points.  If
all doctors collectively bill more points, the reimbursement per point
declines--in one case, from DM40 per 400 points to DM24.</tt><p>
<tt>Employers and workers in Germany each contribute about 6.5 percent of their
gross earnings for health care, for a total of 13 percent.  In France,
employees contribute seven percent, and employers 13 percent, for a total 20
percent. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC10">UK:
Welfare for Asylum
</a>Seekers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On September 23, the Secretary for States of Social Security, Peter Lilley,
told Parliament of new regulations which allow asylum seekers who have been
granted refugee status to make claims for income support, housing and tax
benefits for the period they may have been denied benefits as asylum seekers.
The regulations were announced during proceedings on the Asylum and Immigration
Act of 1996, which went into effect July 24, 1996. </tt><p>
<tt>In September, 1996, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI)
received permission to bring a full High Court case against the decision of the
Lilley to use emergency legislation to deny welfare benefits to all asylum
seekers who applied for asylum inside the UK in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The Asylum and Immigration Act, which bars welfare payments to foreigners
who do not apply for asylum in the UK upon arrival, went into effect in July
1996.  However, Lilley decided to deny welfare benefits to asylum seekers who
fail to apply immediately upon their arrival in the UK in February before the
act took effect.</tt><p>
<tt>Of the 17,375 asylum applications from January through July, 1996, 11,025
were made after the foreigner entered the UK, so that he/she was not eligible
for welfare payments.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 21, 1996, the JCWI won a Court of Appeal victory, when the court
declared unlawful several voluntary organizations who offered shelter and food
to asylum seekers denied welfare payments.</tt><p>
<tt>After seven Iraqis hijacked a Sudan Airways plane and requested asylum in
the UK, and an Iranian hung onto a hovercraft from France to apply for asylum
in the UK, some newspapers complained that the UK was the European country in
which it was easiest to get asylum.  The Iranian was reportedly involved in
selling illegal pornographic videos in Tehran, and paid smugglers $3,000 to be
taken to Europe.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are 100,000 self-employed Asians in the UK, many working long hours
for low net wages, and some commentators credit them with helping re-invigorate
the UK economy.  At the same time, a study of what Asian immigrant parents want
for their children shows that most want their children to be professionals
rather than self-employed.</tt><p>
<tt>Some campaign groups are claiming that Britain has become a "slave haven"
for employers who abuse migrant domestic workers.  Many cannot leave their jobs
due to government rules which state that migrant workers who enter Britain as
domestic workers are allowed to stay only if they remain with their original
employer.  The Liberal Democrats and Labour parties plan to discuss the issue
when they meet in early October. </tt><p>
<tt>The Home Office says it has considered changing the law but believes that
would make it more difficult to control the 12,000 domestic workers who enter
Britain each year. </tt><p>
<tt>Stowaways on board ship cost the shipping industry at North American posts
about $45,000 per migrant, including fines, guards, hotel or detention center
costs and subsistence expenses.  If asylum is claimed and refused, repatriation
costs are paid by the shipping company.  The International Maritime Bureau
estimates that there were 6,500 reported stowaways worldwide between 1991 and
1993.  Some shipping companies hire firms to repatriate the stowaways.  </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC11">France:
African
Immigrants</a></>
</a></h2>
<tt>On September 12, 1996, hundreds of African and Asian immigrants occupied a
Paris police office that issues residence permits, demanding residence permits
for 350 of the immigrants from 21 countries.</tt><p>
<tt>That same day the Interior ministry announced that 57 Romanians were
deported to Bucharest on a chartered flight, and 14 Tunisians sent home by
ship.  This brings the number of foreigners removed from France to 8,800 so far
in 1996, up 24 percent from the level a year earlier.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the 130 Africans removed by police from a Paris church on August
23, 1996 remain in France--nine were deported by mid-September, while 49 were
given residency papers.  Another 64 have been told that they will be deported
to Mali; eight were flown home.  A police union criticized courts for annulling
or suspending many of the expulsion orders.</tt><p>
<tt>Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre's popularity soared after ordering the
raid on the church in August.  Some 32 percent of those polled said he should
play an important role in politics in the future.</tt><p>
<tt>In Mali, which is receiving nationals removed from both France and Angola,
reaction has been muted.  One government leader deplored "the disheartening
spectacle presented by these immigrants who give the impression that returning
to Africa is like a return to hell."  The Mali government banned a march
planned for September 4 in the capital to protest the French raid and
deportations.</tt><p>
<tt>Mali, a country of nine million, ranked 171 out of 174 countries in the UN
Development Program's 1996 Human Development Report.</tt><p>
<tt>The Consultative National Human Rights Commission of the UN asked the
French government on September 12 to review the implementation of 1993
immigration laws to clarify the legal status of foreigners who have a French
spouse, the foreign spouses and children of legal foreign residents, foreign
parents of French-born children, illegal residents who have a job and have
integrated into French society, and foreign students.  </tt><p>
<tt>In addition, the Commission asked the French government to consider
creating a status similar to German "Duldung" and US Temporary Protected
Status--temporary legal residence for non-refugees who cannot be returned
because of problems at home.</tt><p>
<tt>On September 14, Jean-Marie Le Pen led 2,000 people in a march through
Marseilles in remembrance of a teenager allegedly killed by a youth of Arab
origin.  Marchers carried banners with slogans that included "Protect our
children," "Immigration equals insecurity," and "France for the French."</tt><p>
<tt>Earlier in September Len Pen said that racial inequality was a "fact," and
that some civilizations, including the French, are superior to others.</tt><p>
<tt>A September 29 profile concluded that Le Pen was succeeding in his bid to
persuade French voters to see the National Front as the only alternative to the
political establishment.  In 1995, the National Front got 15 percent of the
vote in the first round of the presidential election, and three National Front
mayors were elected.  </tt><p>
<tt>Current polls show that about the same percentage of French voters would
vote for the National Front today, but they also suggest that between 30
percent and 50 percent of French people say they share some of Le Pen's views.
The Front's campaign literature includes the slogan: "Neither left nor right.
French."</tt><p>
<tt>Justice Minister Jacques Toubon announced that a draft bill tightening laws
against racism would likely be approved by parliament in October.  Under the
proposed legislation, even indirect provocations to discrimination, hatred, or
violence would be a crime.</tt><p>
<tt>A May 1996 profile of immigrants in France by INSEE reported that, in 1990,
four million immigrants in France were seven percent of the French population.
The 1.7 million immigrants in the French work force were six percent of
France's 28 million labor force, but their unemployment rate was twice the
French rate.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC12">Swed</a>en
Tightens
Asylum</a></></a></h2>
<tt>Swedish Citizenship and Asylum Minister Pierre Schori on September 20, 1996
proposed legislation that would tighten asylum and refugee regulations.  Under
the new regulations, all asylum seekers would have to be photographed and
fingerprinted to prevent people from applying twice under different
names.</tt><p>
<tt>In addition, only unmarried children under 18, down from 20, could join
parents granted asylum in Sweden.  The new regulations eliminate asylum for
conscientious objectors, and eliminate asylum for persons who risk persecution
in countries where there is no state authority.</tt><p>
<tt>Sweden acknowledges the criteria for granting asylum in the Geneva
Convention on Refugees, and adds three more grounds for seeking asylum.  Sweden
will grant refugees status to those who risk the death penalty or torture,
those who flee because of armed conflict or environmental catastrophe, and
those who are persecuted based on gender or homosexuality.</tt><p>
<tt>Sweden's Parliament will soon vote on the legislation.  </tt><p>
<tt>There were 32,486 immigrants in 1995, including 2,135 foreigners accepted
as refugees. The new legislation is expected to cut the number of refugees in
half, and allow the government to streamline immigration procedures.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration peaked at 78,987 in 1994, when 80 percent of the immigrants
came from non-Nordic countries, including 33,587 Bosnians.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 12 percent of Sweden's 8.8 million residents were born outside
Sweden, about the same proportion of foreign-born as in the US.  Sweden,
traditionally a very open country for those seeking asylum, began to restrict
asylum after the dramatic rise in asylum seekers in 1994.  In 1995, the number
of immigrants fell to 32,486.</tt><p>
<tt>Human Rights Watch criticized Sweden on September 24 for its "increasingly
restrictive asylum policies," after it tightened up rules on asylees.  Human
Rights Watch claims that many asylum seekers are being denied asylum without a
fair hearing.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC13">Italy</a>:
 Amnesty for Enforcement
Assistance?</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Italy is experimenting with amnesty for illegal aliens who help the
authorities locate and prosecute persons who break immigration laws.  Under the
new law, Italy "will be allowed to grant a one-year renewable residence permit
to non-EU foreigners facing legal action who decide to collaborate with
judicial authorities by denouncing those who exploit them."</tt><p>
<tt>The aim is to persuade deportable aliens involved with prostitution or
drugs to provide evidence on their bosses.</tt><p>
<tt>A naturalized Italian citizen who moved to Italy from the Dominican
Republic when her mother married an Italian won the Miss Italy 1996 beauty
contest, prompting a number of reflections on racial tolerance in Italy, what
it means to be Italian, and "Italian beauty."  </tt><p>
<tt>Two of the judges were initially suspended for saying, before the
competition, that a black woman could not represent Italian beauty.  According
to one judge, "I would happily elect her Miss Universe.  But what has she got
to do with Italy?  She is not Mediterranean."  During the pageant, one-third of
the one million Italians who called in their vote gave it to Mendez.   Prime
Minister Romano Prodi had a commented on the Miss Italy results, "Italy is
changing," he said.  "We also have black soccer players, and now this too is a
sign."</tt><p>
<tt>The government reports that there are almost one million foreigners living
in Italy, a country with a population of 56 million, not counting naturalized
Italians and "hundreds of thousands" of illegal  immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Italian police dismantled a smuggling ring that brought women into Italy on
false seasonal farm worker contracts.  The women received medical certificates
from Italian doctors and were then employed in Italian nightclubs.</tt><p>
<tt>About 1.5 million Italians lived outside Italy in other European nations in
1993, including 560,000 in Germany, 380,000 in Switzerland, 250,000 in France,
and 240,000 in Belgium.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC16">Kurds</a>
and Refugees</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>There are two major factions fighting for independence for the 15 to 20
million ethnic Kurds scattered across Turkey, Iran and Iraq.  In September
1996, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) invited Saddam Hussein to send in
Iraqi troops to help the KDP oust its Kurdish rival, the Patriotic Union of
Kurdestan (PUK), from several northern Iraq cities that were in the safe zone
declared off limits to Iraqi troops after the 1991 Gulf War.</tt><p>
<tt>The fighting produced refugees.  The largest contingent, some 40,000 PUK
adherents, moved to Iran, which received 1.4 million Kurdish refugees after the
Gulf War.  But this time, Iran was not as hospitable, keeping the Iraqi Kurds
in tent cities rather than permitting them free movement.</tt><p>
<tt>Iran hosts the largest refugee population in the world, two million
according to the Iranian government.  In an effort to persuade Afghan refugees
to return, Iran is offering them $25 and 110 pounds of wheat.</tt><p>
<tt>The US offered to accept as refugees the 250 persons who worked for the US
State Department's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance as drivers, clerks,
and translators.  With their families, some 2,100 people were flown to Guam to
apply for asylum in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The European Union is expected to offer asylum to about 6,000 Kurds who
assisted in European peace keeping efforts.</tt><p>
<tt>About half of the ethnic Kurds live in Turkey--the so-called bridge between

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC19">Internal
Migration and Stability in
China</a></a</a></h2>
<tt>China's population hit 1.2 billion at the end of 1995, so that China had 21
percent of the world's 5.8 billion residents.  About 45 percent of China's
population is under 26.</tt><p>
<tt>China is one of the world's poorest and fastest growing countries.  Its
average per capita income is about $500, and its economic growth has been six
to eight percent a year, which means that incomes can more than double within a
decade.</tt><p>
<tt>Growth is not spread evenly across China.  The fastest economic and job
growth is occurring in the largest cities along the southeastern coast, such as
Shanghai and Shenzhen.  One result is internal migration, and tensions in areas
of origin and destination that, some fear, could threaten China's
stability.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Internal Migration</u>.  Internal migration within China is similar in
many respects to international migration for employment, in the sense that the
Chinese registration system acts as a barrier to rural-urban movements.  Most
rural migrants in Chinese cities are there without government permission,
unauthorized workers who fill jobs in construction, services, and manufacturing
that are shunned by local residents.  They are liable to detection, fines and
deportation to their rural residences. </tt><p>
<tt>About 70 percent , or 864 million, of China's residents live in rural
areas, where household incomes average about $225 per year, versus $425 in
urban areas.  An estimated 150 million rural workers--a third of the rural
labor force of 450 million--is unemployed or underemployed; Chinese data say
there are 130 million "surplus workers" in rural areas.  </tt><p>
<tt>Surplus labor in the countryside, and unfilled jobs in China's cities that
offer wages that are low by urban standards, but high by rural standards, have
set in motion an internal migration believed to involve at least 50 million,
and possibly 70 to 100 million, internal migrants.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, for example, Beijing and Shanghai were believed to have 3.3
million migrants each, so that migrants were 25 to 30 percent of those cities'
populations.  Applying these migrant percentages to China's 350 million urban
residents yields the estimate of 70 to 100 million migrants.  (It should be
noted that not all of the migrants in Chinese cities are migrant workers;
one-third may be persons away from their registered residences for business,
tourism, and education reasons).</tt><p>
<tt>From 1957 though January 1, 1994, internal migration was restricted by a
household registration system (hukou bu) that required residents to be
registered with local authorities.  There were two major classifications,
agricultural resident (nongye hukou) and urban resident (Chengshi jumin hukou),
and only urban residents were entitled to subsidized housing, coupons for food
and jobs.  </tt><p>
<tt>Those registered as agricultural residents remain agricultural residents
even after they move to cities, and are subject to forced return to the
countryside, as occurred after the collapse of the Great Leap Forward in 1960.
</tt><p>
<tt>Chinese policies treated agriculture as a source of low-cost food for
industrial workers.  This made the household registration system necessary to
prevent rural-urban migration.  As grain prices fell and costs rose in the
1980s, more and more rural residents migrated illegally to Chinese cities.
</tt><p>
<tt>Much of the Chinese migration is circular, meaning that the migrant retains
a link to his village--Chinese terminology distinguishes between migration
(quanyi), an official change of household registration, and floating population
(liudong renkou).  </tt><p>
<tt>There are several reasons why many migrant workers in Chinese cities retain
a link to the land, including the fear that government policy may change and
force "agricultural" residents back to the countryside.  Chinese who live away
from the place where they are registered are generally unable to obtain
subsidized housing and food, and can be rounded up and deported to the place
where they are registered to live.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Migration Networks</u>.  Young rural men tend to migrate to urban areas
to fill construction jobs, while young rural women often find jobs in factories
in the coastal areas, where they earn $1.25 to $1.75 per day, two to five times
what they would earn farming.  Most of China's 25 million construction workers
are migrants from the countryside.</tt><p>
<tt>There is currently a struggle between migrants, their employers and local
government authorities over how to deal with the rural-urban wage gap that
motivates migration.  In Beijing, for example, employers have to pay the
equivalent of $11,600 for urban residence permits for migrant workers from the
countryside but the fine for employing a workers without a permit is only 1,000
yuan ($120).</tt><p>
<tt>Individuals can buy residence permits to live in Beijing at a cost of
$5,800.  Migrants found working without permits, or arrested for vagrancy, are
often sentenced to produce goods for three to six months in prison
factories.</tt><p>
<tt>Most migrants report that they must pay for the permit or suffer
harassment.  In December 1995, 500 migrant construction workers burned the
local Communist party headquarters to protest police harassment.  Many local
authorities find it easier to get money from migrants than from local
employers.</tt><p>
<tt>Much of the matching of rural-urban migrants with jobs occurs in or near
China's railroad stations, where labor brokers surround migrants as they alight
from trains.  They charge workers 100 to 200 yuan ($12 to $24 dollars) to
"introduce" migrant job seekers to potential employers.</tt><p>
<tt>Beijing opened a recruitment center in 1996 for migrant workers in the West
Railway Station, the first step to regularize the flow of an estimated three
million migrant workers employed by some 2,900 enterprises and private
businesses.  The West Railway Station, at 580,000 square yards the largest
railway station in Asia, was built with the help of 20,000 migrant workers over
three years.  China's state railways have 3.4 million employees. </tt><p>
<tt>Migrants often escape tight local controls on family planning, prompting
the southeastern province of Fujian in China to pass the country's first law
forcing migrant workers to be sterilized after giving birth to one child if
they want a job in Fujian.  </tt><p>
<tt>The new law dictates that couples applying for jobs must produce
sterilization certificates to prove that they will not have another child--the
new rules apply only to migrant men and women.  About 80 percent of the births
in Fujian province in 1995 were to the "daily" commuter population of about
three million.  Another one million migrants live in Fujian province for one
month or more.</tt><p>
<tt><u>What Next? .</u>  By all measures, the number of migrants within China
is increasing.  The Chinese State Planning Commission predicts that only 46
percent of the nation's projected work force of 669 million will be farmers in
the year 2000, down from 53 percent in 1995.  Other estimates predict more
displacement from agriculture due to rural population increases and
encroachment on farm land by development projects. </tt><p>
<tt>Chinese analysts are divided on what to do about rural-urban migration.  On
the one side are those who want grant legal status to agricultural persons
already living in urban areas, and permit their families to join them in the
cities.  Under this proposal, China would abandon the household registration
system that limits mobility, and keeps migrants living in fear of deportation.
</tt><p>
<tt>On the other side are those who argue that large numbers of rural migrants
could destabilize Chinese cities and the government, and that the registration
system is necessary to prevent a massive "floating population."</tt><p>
<tt>If the government restricts rural-urban migration too tightly, there could
be rebellions in poor areas.  One Chinese analyst uses his view of the cause of
the US Civil War--the economic disparity between the North and South--to urge
measures to reduce Chinese rural poverty.  The Chinese government should
redirect foreign investment away from coastal areas into the interior to reduce
the rural poverty that is prompting migration, he concludes.</tt><p>
<tt>One Chinese city, Zhuhai near Hong Kong, in 1994 erected a nine-foot high
fence around itself to deter unauthorized rural-urban migration.  Some see
fences as a wave of the future.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Chinese Abroad</u>.  Beginning in the 1950s as "foreign labor
cooperation," China has sent workers abroad to complete 1,000 projects in 70
countries, most notably the railroad between Tanzania and Zambia.</tt><p>
<tt>Between 130,000 to 200,000 Chinese work outside the country, mostly in
Asia.  In 1994, it was estimated that remittances and earnings from
Chinese-supplied materials used in foreign projects generated $8 billion for
China in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>After economic reforms in 1978, China began to promote the export of labor
as a means to earn foreign exchange and to ease domestic unemployment.  Three
major types of government entities--national government corporations, local
government companies, and trading companies--and today there are 130,000 to
200,000 Chinese workers abroad, mostly in Asia.  The Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation, which reports 200,000 migrant workers outside China
in 1994, estimated that remittances and earnings from Chinese-supplied
materials used in foreign projects generated $8 billion for China in
1994.</tt><p>
<tt>There are also Chinese "worker-trainees" employed temporarily in Japan,
ex-USSR, and the US, Chinese farmers in Japan, and 10,000 Chinese workers in
South Korea.  China is asking Japanese and Korean construction firms to
consider using Chinese workers when they win contracts in third countries, such
as the Gulf states.</tt><p>
<tt>Over half of all Chinese workers abroad come from 10 of China's 30
provinces.  About 20 percent come from the South China provinces of Guandong
and Fujian, two of the fastest growing provinces in China.</tt><p>
<tt>Chinese officials estimate that, of the 220,000 Chinese students who have
gone abroad since 1979, only 75,000 have returned.  The Chinese government
believes that part of the blame for this 'brain drain' falls on Western nations
such as Canada and the United States whose immigration policies give easy entry
to the well-educated.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Foreigners in China</u>.  Eighty foreigners are applying each day for
permits to work in Shanghai.  Many of the foreigners are employees of
Sino-overseas joint ventures or foreign-owned companies.  Nearly 3,000
foreigners have been granted work permits since the city began requiring them
in May, 1996.  An estimated 20,000 foreigners, primarily from Hong Kong, Macao
and Taiwan live in Shanghai. </tt><p>
<tt>In June 1995, the Chinese government announced that it would reinforce its
border controls to halt illegal immigration, especially into the southern
regions of the country.  More than 20,000 foreigners enter China illegally
every year, mostly from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, plus a small number of
illegal immigrants from Africa and Russia.  In 1994, police detained 12,000
illegal immigrants in the Yunnan province and the autonomous region of Guangxi.

<a name="RTFToC20">Singapore</a>:
 Illegals in Construction</a>

<tt>Singapore employs about 350,000 foreign workers, and foreign workers are 20
percent of the island nation's labor force.</tt><p>
<tt>Singapore is considered to run one of the tightest guest worker programs in
the world, regulating the ratio of foreign to domestic workers, charging
employers a monthly tax or levy for each legal foreign worker they hire, and
imposing stiff penalties on illegal workers and their employers.</tt><p>
<tt>However, the Singapore press has been reporting that more and more illegal
foreign workers have been found in Singapore.  In September, 1996, two Japanese
construction firms paid a private company $10,000 to conduct midnight raids in
search of illegal foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The Singapore Contractors Association has called for an amnesty so that
illegal workers could be registered.  A construction industry representative
said that an amnesty would help determine the number of number of illegal
workers currently on site and then construction companies could pay a levy for
illegal workers and they could continue to work on the site. </tt><p>
<tt>The construction industry also claims that with sub-contractors being held
accountable for the legality of the workers they hire, they are demanding more
money from the main contractor in order to hire legal workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Recent amendments to the Immigration Act and the Employment of Foreign
Workers Act make the main contractors responsible for the legality of all
workers on their sites, even workers who, as in these cases, sneak onto the
site to sleep at night.</tt><p>
<tt>In order to decrease dependence on foreign workers, the Singapore
government launched a "Back to Work" program to attract housewives, older
persons and displaced workers into the workforce.  </tt><p>

overtime pay if they work on their day off.  They will also receive a seven-day
paid vacation after one year of employment.  The maids can apply for sick leave
of up to 30 days a year.  </tt><p>
<tt>Employers can require helpers to work for a 40-day trial period.  If the
employer deems them incompetent, foreigners can be dismissed, and required to
buy their own plane tickets back home.  Foreign workers who commit crimes,
violate Taiwanese laws, marry in Taiwan or get pregnant, contract contagious
diseases, or bring families to Taiwan can also be fired.</tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan has about 30,000 foreign maids, most of whom are from the
Philippines. </tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan is hoping to improve the marriage prospects for Taiwanese women by
reducing the number of foreign brides entering the county.  Taiwanese men are
said to prefer foreign brides because Taiwanese women, who are better educated
and more affluent, expect too much from their husbands. </tt><p>
<tt>Under the new quotas, only 360 women from Indonesia, 420 from Myanmar, and
1,080 from China can enter Taiwan for marriage each year.  A quota will soon be
imposed on Vietnamese women.  There is no quota for Western spouses. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC24">Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait:  Reduce Dependence on
Foreigners?</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>In Saudi Arabia, where six of seven service workers are foreigners, the
government has hired foreign firms to teach young Saudis desirable work traits
such as punctuality, reliability, and courtesy and is trying to persuade
employers to hire Saudis by prohibiting the admission of foreign secretaries.
</tt><p>
<tt>The government also requires firms to increase the number of Saudis in
their work forces by five percent each year.  </tt><p>
<tt>On the supply side of the labor market, the government is offering native
youth up to $190 per week to attend one-year courses designed to turn them into
desirable service workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The Deputy Labor Minister says that "Every job filled by a foreigner is
considered a temporary job to be filled by a Saudi whenever it is possible."
Many employers reportedly prefer foreigners because they work for $500 per
month, and they can be deported if fired, versus $1,000 per month expected by
Saudis.</tt><p>
<tt>When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, there were about 650,000 Kuwaiti
citizens and 1.4 million foreign workers in Kuwait.  The war reduced the number
of foreign workers to about 700,000.  </tt><p>
<tt>After seven-month occupation by Iraq ended, the Kuwaiti government expelled
700,000 Palestinian, Jordanian, and Yemeni guest workers in a bid for
self-reliance.  However, by 1992, newspapers were reporting that foreigners
once again dominated the labor force, this time Egyptians, Iranians and
Asians.</tt><p>
<tt>Today, Kuwait finds itself as reliant on foreign workers as before--six of
seven workers is a foreigners.  Egyptians, Pakistanis, Filipinos and others
fill jobs that the Palestinians left behind.  Most foreigners are in Kuwait
without their families, and many work six days each week.</tt><p>
<tt>Kuwaitis comprise just 16 percent of the workforce.  Each Kuwaiti is
guaranteed a job, and 93 percent are government employees.  Kuwaiti wages are
double those paid to foreigners, and many leave their jobs at lunch.  As a
early half of the government's expenses go to government salaries compared to
one-third to defense.  </tt><p>
<tt>Today, Kuwait's population is two million, 1.3 million of whom are
non-Kuwaitis, according to the most recent government statistics.  Of a total
labor force of 1.1 million, only 176,000 are Kuwaiti citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>Kuwait has a per capita income of $23,000, and an estimated 10 percent of
the world's oil reserves.</tt><p>
<tt>There are 720,000 Kuwaiti citizens, but only 107,000 can vote--only men who
can trace their ancestry back at least one generation are allowed to vote.  In
September, there were demonstrators by Kuwaiti women demanding the right to
vote.  </tt><p>
<tt>Kuwait has reduced the number of  "bidoon" or stateless residents, from
117,000 to 220,000 since the Gulf War.  Most are of Iranian or Iraqi origin and
some have lived in Kuwait for generations.  The government does not plan to
grant them citizenship, and has purged many bidoon from the Kuwaiti military.

Iraq.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC25">Immigration
into Argentina</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Argentina (36 million population) is a magnet for migrants from Bolivia
(seven million), Peru (24 million) and Paraguay (five million).</tt><p>
<tt>Argentina has an estimated 200,000 illegal immigrants, and the debate over
what to do about illegal immigrants sounds very familiar to Americans.  There
are those who say that, with a 2,500-mile western border which has 795 crossing
points, Argentina cannot stop illegal immigrants, and that Argentineans do not
want to do certain types of jobs.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Bermejo River that separates Argentina ($8,200 per capita GNP) and
Bolivia ($900 per capita GNP) has been likened to the Rio Grande.  Bolivians
have long been Argentina's migrant workers, cutting sugar cane and picking
oranges in the northern provinces, and working their way south to vineyards in
the wine country and potato farms near Buenos Aires.  More recently, Bolivians
have found jobs picking apples in the flatlands near Patagonia, replacing
Chileans.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Argentineans complain of the "Bolivianization" of northern
Argentina.</tt><p>
<tt>The countries of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile and soon
Bolivia are linked in a free-trade area, and there is a long-standing tradition
that allows the free transit over borders of residents living within 30 miles
of the border.</tt><p>
<tt>Some estimates put the number of illegal Bolivians in Argentina at 200,000.
Many are in Buenos Aries, where Korean-owned textile factories hire illegal
Bolivian and Paraguayan workers for as little as $300 a month for a 60-hour
week.</tt><p>
<tt>Argentina in July had a 17 percent unemployment rate, which has led the
government to step up the enforcement of immigration laws.  One requirement,
that tourists from neighboring countries show they have at least $1,500, has
spawned a new business--the lending of $1,500 by the hour so that Bolivians and
Peruvians can enter Argentina.</tt><p>
<tt>Argentina in 1991 had five percent foreign-born residents, down sharply
from 1914, when one-third of Argentina's residents were born abroad--40 percent
of the foreign born were from Italy, and 35 percent from Spain.</tt><p>
<tt>In Peru, unemployment is eight percent, and underemployment is 75 to 90
percent.  About 20 percent of Peruvians live in "critical poverty."</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC26">100,000
Immigrants to Australia</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The number of immigrants arriving in Australia rose to 99,139 in the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1996.  The three leading countries of origin were New
Zealand 12.4 percent, Britain 11.4 percent, and China 11.3 percent.  Included
were 13,800 refugees.</tt><p>
<tt>The government plans to reduce immigration to 74,000 in 1996-97, in part by
introducing a "cap and queue" system that may require spouses to wait for
permission to immigrate to join their husbands in Australia.  Under current
law, an unlimited number of spouses can enter Australia.  In 1996-97, there are
expected to be about 50,000 requests for family unification visas, although the
"quota" is 36,700.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1995-96, there was a 30 per cent increase in applications for spouse
visas from Asian countries, especially from the spouses of the 40,000 Chinese
granted refugee  status in Australia after the crackdown in June 1989.
Immigrants entering Australia on spouse visas receive a two-year probationary
residence status.</tt><p>
<tt>The Australian government plans to propose legislation that would permit
the deportation of immigrants and naturalized Australians who lie about their
qualifications or falsely describe their marital status in their application
for permanent residency.  Under current law, permanent residents can become
naturalized Australians after two years.</tt><p>
<tt>In her maiden speech to Australia's Federal Parliament, an independent MP
on September 10, 1996 invoked the name Arthur Calwell, a former Labor Party
leader remembered for his words: "Two Wongs don't make a White," when she
asserted that Asian immigrants "have their own culture and religion, form
ghettoes and do not assimilate."  </tt><p>
<tt>According to the MP, Australia is danger of being "swamped" by Asians.  She
urged Australia to reinstate the White Australia policy, and end its
mult-cultural policies.</tt><p>
<tt>A survey of 1,800 Australians found that 63 percent believe immigration
should be reduced, including 51 percent of foreign-born persons in the country.
Others studies suggest that immigrants from some countries were experiencing
long-term unemployment.</tt><p>
<tt>Australian Minister for Immigration Philip Ruddock said that the MP's
comments "reflect a degree of xenophobia we think is very unhelpful."</tt><p>
<tt>Some seven to eight percent of Australia's 20 million people are of Asian
descent.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 28,670 people emigrated from Australia in the fiscal year ending June
30, 1996.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC28">Slate
on
Immigration</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>The Internet magazine
Slate--http://www.slate.com/COC/96-08-19/CoC.asp--hosted a discussion of
immigration and poverty August 19-23, 1995, in which Mark Krikorian asserted
that US immigration policy is the major factor harming poor Americans that the
US government can control--globalization, technology etc. are more difficult
for governments to control.  Several studies suggest that immigration accounts
for 30 to 50 percent of the increase in the wage gap between the richest and
poorest Americans.</tt><p>
<tt>George Borjas asserted that, between 1970 and 1990, the percentage of
foreign-born persons with below-poverty level incomes rose from 14 to 18
percent, while the percentage of native-born persons with below-poverty level
incomes remained at 13 percent.  According to Borjas, the rise in immigrant
poverty is due to the growing gap between the education levels of immigrants
and natives--in 1970, recent immigrant men had about one-half year of schooling
than US-born men, but by 1990, the education gap had widened to 1.3
years.</tt><p>
<tt>Borjas argued that the arrival of more unskilled immigrants held down wages
for unskilled natives, and increased the number of poor persons getting welfare
benefits, especially in-kind benefits such as Food Stamps--in 1990, 21 percent
of immigrant households receive some type of public assistance, as compared to
only 14 percent of native households, and only about 10 percent of non-Hispanic
white native households.</tt><p>
<tt>Barry Chiswick noted that, by one measure, immigration is only one-third as
great today as at the turn of the century.  Between 1871 to 1920, the annual
rate of immigration was about eight per thousand U.S. population, in contrast
to a rate of about three per thousand US population in the last 15 years.
Without immigration, Chiswick asserts, there would have been more income
equality, and more rural-urban migration.</tt><p>
<tt>Peter Skerry agreed that unskilled immigrants depress wages and add to the
US poverty population, but that public desires to reduce immigration are as
much due to the "unprecedented, demands" of immigrants for bilingual education
or ballots, voting rights electoral districts, or affirmative action benefits.
According to Skerry, the major issue is how immigrants are incorporated into US
society, not their number.  Skerry also believes that the US must do far more
to reduce illegal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>Sanford Ungar agreed that the US is importing poverty with immigration, but
he argued that immigrants willing to work hard are not a problem because they
begin their American journey poor.  Ungar argues that the immigration debate is
being manipulated by politicians who are blaming immigrants for widespread
economic insecurity and uncertainty.  Ungar advocates more immigration, raising
legal immigration and admitting guest workers, and the provision of health and
education services to them.</tt><p>
<tt>The panelists also considered the effects of increased imports and
increased immigration, noting that immigration is a long-term increased in the
labor supply.  Moderator Herb Stein concluded that all panelists agreed that
the US was importing poverty via immigration, and that most agreed that more
resources needed to be devoted to reducing illegal immigration.</tt><p>

Controversy</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
Continues</a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>As the number of newly-naturalized US citizens surpassed 1.1 million in
FY96, Republicans stepped up their attacks on Citizenship USA.  Vice President
Gore launched the INS-administered initiative Citizenship USA in 1995 to
eliminate the backlog of 800,000 immigrants who applied for US citizenship and
were waiting to be naturalized.</tt><p>
<tt>Republicans charged that expedited naturalization was an attempt by the
Clinton administration to add Democrats to the voter rolls in California and
other key states before the November 1996 elections.  The INS officer in
Fresno, for example, asserted in an April 1996 letter that the "INS has been
told to naturalize everyone who filed Form N-400 prior to April 1, 1996, in
time for them to register to vote in the November election."</tt><p>
<tt>A Dole radio ad in California charged that "aliens with criminal records
--rapists, murderers, armed felons -- have been granted US  citizenship so they
can vote."</tt><p>
<tt>Republicans uncovered documents that showed that a member of Gore's staff
complained on March 28, 1996 that INS headquarters was hindering efforts to
produce "a million new voters by election day."  One memo discussed ways to
"lower the standards for citizenship." The INS eventually granted its district
managers in some cities the authority to waive some INS rules and regulations
to speed up naturalizations.  Citizenship USA used community-based groups to
recruit permanent residents for naturalization.</tt><p>
<tt>Republicans also charged that the INS permitted foreign criminals to become
US citizens.  The FBI on October 24, 1996 estimated that 100,000 immigrants
with criminal histories may have become US citizens since August 1995, when
Citizenship USA began, based on the FBI's assumption that eight to 10 percent
of the applicants for naturalization have criminal records.</tt><p>
<tt>In Los Angeles, an INS clerk charged that the INS destroyed more than 4,000
fingerprints from aliens seeking naturalization before they were forwarded, as
required, to the FBI to verify that the aliens did not have criminal records.
This prompted California Governor Pete Wilson to release a letter to US
Attorney General Janet Reno on October 21, 1996 saying that "The federal
government should be deporting such dangerous criminals, not rushing to
naturalize them."  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS countered that the fingerprint cards were destroyed because they
were not complete and that the naturalization applicants were ordered to submit
new ones.  The INS said that no more than 1,300 people with criminal histories
were improperly naturalized in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS says that it processed 1.3 million applications for US citizenship
in FY96, and rejected about 220,000 applications, a 17 percent rejection
rate.</tt><p>
<tt>On October 24, 1996, the INS issued regulations that allow the agency,
rather than a US court, to revoke the US citizenship of persons found to have
been improperly naturalized.</tt><p>
<tt>Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY) focused on "the rights and privileges" of
naturalization during the immigration subcommittee's last hearing of the year
on October 22, 1996.  The hearing ranged over questions such as whether the US
should permit dual citizenship and whether the US has made it too easy to
naturalize.</tt><p>
<tt>Most industrial democracies are making naturalization easier.  In the US,
most legal immigrants must be residents for five years before applying,
although spouses of US citizens can apply after three years.</tt><p>
<tt>In New Zealand and Australia, by contrast, legal immigrants can apply for
naturalization after two or three years of residence.</tt><p>
<tt>In California, immigrants eager to naturalize are often bilked by notarios,
non-lawyer paralegals who sometimes operate from fancy leased offices, collect
thousands of dollars from immigrants and then disappear.  In some cases, the
$2,000 to $4,000 lost represents several years of an immigrant's
savings.<b></b></tt><p>

<tt><u>Presidential Politics</u>.  After the second debate between presidential
candidates Robert Dole and Bill Clinton in San Diego on October 16, 1996, Dole
tried to win votes in California by accusing the Clinton administration of
failing to control illegal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>On October 17 in Riverside, Dole complained that Californians must pay for
"drug rehab for illegal aliens in prison."  According to Dole, "Whenever he
[Clinton] has to choose between California taxpayers and the militant groups
who demand public support for illegal aliens, he sides with the militant
special-interest groups."</tt><p>
<tt>Dole accused Clinton of weakening the new immigration law by persuading
Congress to accept revisions in last minute negotiations, so that: "If you are
in this country illegally, you can stay in public housing, collect welfare, get
free medical care and even invite family members abroad to come and join
you."</tt><p>
<tt>On October 15, 1996, California Governor Pete Wilson sponsored an "open
letter" in the New York Times that accused President Clinton of "sticking
California taxpayers with $3 billion per year for illegal immigrants."  Wilson
charged that the Clinton administration's last minute changes to the 1996
immigration law will allow illegal aliens who unlawfully received US welfare
benefits to nonetheless become naturalized US citizens, to permit illegal
aliens in public housing to remain there and to continue to allow wages earned
by unauthorized aliens to be credited to that alien's Social Security
account.</tt><p>
<tt>The flap over an Indonesian couple's $425,000 contribution to the
Democratic National Committee sparked a debate over an anomaly in US law: legal
immigrants living in the United States can contribute to political parties and
candidates, but they may not vote.  Clinton and Dole pledged that, if elected,
they would make it unlawful for non-US citizens to make political
contributions.</tt><p>
<tt>There is only one Asian-American holding statewide office in California,
even though Asian-Americans are 11 percent of California's residents.
Asian-Americans outnumber Blacks in Los Angeles County, but there are no
Asian-Americans on the 15-member Board of Supervisors, versus three African
Americans and three Latinos.</tt><p>
<tt>Once Asian Americans register to vote, they vote.  In the 1994 election, 76
percent of the registered Asian American voters went to the polls, compared to
73 percent of whites, 64 percent of Latinos and 63 percent of African
Americans.</tt><p>
<tt>The Asian population of the US was 1.5 million in 1970 and is expected to
top 12 million by the year 2000.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Latino Voters</u>.  An estimated 6.6 million Hispanics were registered
to vote in the November 1996 elections, up from 4.8 million registered to vote
in 1992, including two million in California, 1.6 million in Texas, 570,000 in
Florida and 540,000 in New York.  About 150,000 Latinos turn 18 every year in
the United States.</tt><p>
<tt>In California, the two million registered Latinos were 12 percent of
California's 16 million registered voters.  [Latinos are one-fourth of
California's 32 million residents].  </tt><p>
<tt>The Tomas Rivera Policy Institute reported on October 22, 1996 the results
of a public opinion poll that found that 71 percent of the Latinos registered
to vote in California and 85 percent of the Latinos naturalized since 1992,
said they planned to vote for Clinton.</tt><p>
<tt>Several groups charged that many non-citizens have registered to vote in
the 1996 elections.</tt><p>
<tt>In the 1996 election, one of the groups that backed Prop. 187 plans to hand
out leaflets to voters approaching the polls that say: "Only citizens can vote!
Violators will be prosecuted!"  </tt><p>
<tt>Several Hispanic groups have termed such leafleting "harassment" designed
to discourage Latino voters and the US Justice Department promised to respond
quickly to complaints of voter harassment.  They formed Latino Election Watch
'96, which includes toll-free hotlines for complaints and a team of lawyers
ready to investigate potential violations of the Voting Rights Act.</tt><p>
<tt>The Democratic party is offering a $25,000 reward to anyone recording video
images of people near polling places "using intimidating and physical threats
against voters."</tt><p>
<tt>In 1988, uniformed guards were stationed at 20 polling places in Santa Ana
in Orange County holding signs in English and Spanish that warned that
noncitizens were barred from voting.  The Republicans who arranged for the
guards denied any wrongdoing, but settled a lawsuit brought by six Hispanic
citizens for $400,000.</tt><p>
<tt>On October 21, 1996, two Central Americans employed by a landscaping
company to work at the vice president's residence were detained by the INS.
The INS began proceedings to deport one of the workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Both workers were able to obtain and present Maryland drivers' licenses to
their employer.  The immigration bill originally contained a provision that
would have required states to check the legal status of applicants for drivers'
licenses, but this provision was deleted in last-minute
negotiations.<b></b></tt><p>

Changes</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>In 1996, three major laws that affect immigrants and immigration were
enacted:  The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, signed into law
on April 24, 1996; the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity
Reconciliation Act, signed into law on August 22, 1996; and The Illegal
Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, signed on
September 30, 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The immigration bill will, inter alia, increase the size of the US Border
Patrol to 10,000 agents by 2001.</tt><p>
<tt>The immigration bill also includes a pilot employee eligibility
verification program that employers in sectors with a history of employing
illegal immigrants will be encouraged to enroll in.  The "basic pilot program"
will be launched in at least five of the seven highest-immigration states.
Employer participation is voluntary, but many expect that the INS may
concentrate its enforcement efforts on non-participating employers.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreigners who remain in the United States for more than six months in an
unlawful status will be barred from entering the US for three years after their
departure, and those who stay unlawfully in the US for one year or more will be
barred from returning legally for 10 years.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>In one of the first moves to implement the new immigration law,
Attorney General Janet Reno asked courts to dismiss five class-action lawsuits
filed on behalf of up to 400,000 illegal immigrants in California and
Washington.  The suits alleged that the aliens were wrongly disqualified from
the legalization program that permitted persons in the US illegally since
January 1, 1982 to apply for permanent resident status in 1987-88.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Justice Department asserted that the lawsuits were filed only to allow
what it estimated to be 100,000 illegal immigrants to remain in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the new immigration law, only the US Supreme Court may issue broad
injunctions against INS policies and procedures.  Some immigration lawyers, who
call the INS a "rogue agency," do not believe that Congress can deprive
foreigners in the US from full access to US courts.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Protest and Suits.</u>  On October 12, 1996, an estimated 25,000 people
demonstrated in Washington DC against "anti-immigrant" sentiment.  "La Marcha"
organizers had predicted that 100,000 of the nation's 26 million Latinos would
participate in what was termed the nation's first "pro-immigrant march."  A
march in 1994 in Los Angeles to oppose Proposition 187 drew 70,000
participants.  The Million Man March organized by African-Americans in 1995
drew an estimated 800,000 people.</tt><p>
<tt>Speakers at the rally urged support for a seven-point agenda that included
human and constitutional rights for all; equal opportunities and affirmative
action; free public education for all; expansion of health services; citizen
police review boards; labor law reform and a $7 per hour minimum wage; a
streamlined citizenship application program; and an amnesty for immigrants who
illegally entered the United States before 1992.</tt><p>
<tt>On October 11, 1996, New York City Mayor Giuliani sued the federal
government over provisions in the new welfare and immigration laws that
allow--not require-- city employees to report suspected illegal immigrants who
seek city services to the INS.  Since 1985, New York City has prohibited its
employees from reporting suspected illegal aliens to INS.  According to the
mayor's office, there were about 400,000 illegal aliens in New York City in
1993, including 85,000 of school age.</tt><p>
<tt>New York officials claimed that allowing city employees to file reports
with INS would violate the 10th Amendment, which reserves for the states all
powers not expressly granted to the federal government.</tt><p>

Enforcement and Management</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt><u>Enforcement.</u>  On October 10, 1996, the INS announced that Operation
Gatekeeper would be extended to East San Diego county.  Intense Border Patrol
agent coverage would thereby be expanded from the 14 westernmost miles of
US-Mexican border to include the 66 westernmost miles.  The number of Border
Patrol agents in the San Diego sector has more than doubled to 2,000 since
Gatekeeper began in October 1994, including 830 agents assigned to the border
from Otay Mountain east to Imperial County. </tt><p>
<tt>In a first-ever case near San Francisco, the INS fined a home owner $450
for failing to complete an I-9 employee verification form for a worker he hired
to do heavy yard work.  According to the INS, the homeowner drove to a "known
day-labor pickup point" in San Rafael, California, picked up two men and drove
them to his home.</tt><p>
<tt>INS agents observing the day labor market followed the homeowner up a dirt
road to his property.  When the INS agents appeared, one worker fled and the
other was apprehended.</tt><p>
<tt>The home owner argues that he should not be fined for two reasons.  First,
work had not yet begun, so the workers had not yet been "hired."  Second, IRCA
exempts US employers from the need to complete I-9 forms for "domestic
service."  The INS contends that, in this case, the workers were hired for
something more akin to construction work--re-establishing a washed-away
hillside--than domestic service.</tt><p>
<tt>The Immigration and Naturalization Service announced that it would begin to
issue Warning Notices to persons who have "minor verification violations" of
employment laws.  Under the new regulations, employers can scan and print out
copies of the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (Form I-9).</tt><p>
<tt>Since 1989, the INS has issued 16,000 notices of intent to fine US
employers, including 2,200 in California, for hiring illegal aliens, or for not
completing I-9 forms.  When the INS discovers violations of employment
eligibility laws, its agents issue either a Warning Notice, Form I-846, or a
Notice of Intent to Fine (NIF), Form I-763.</tt><p>
<tt>An October 5 analysis in the Sacramento Bee suggests that the INS devoted
about two percent of its $2.6 budget in FY96 to employer sanctions enforcement.
The INS typically settles cases against employers for about 40 percent of the
amount initially assessed.  Between April 1988 and August 1995, for example,
the INS proposed $96.3 million in fines on employers, but settled for $38.3
million.</tt><p>
<tt>In a report on fraudulent documents, the Dallas Morning News on October 29,
1996 reported that unauthorized aliens soon learn that the coveted green card
is actually pink and that border crossing cards that permit a Mexican national
to "legally" enter the US can be rented for $50 to $100.</tt><p>
<tt>In Laredo, Texas, the INS seizes about 300 false documents from the three
million border crossers each month.  Some Border Patrol agents estimate that 70
percent to 80 percent of the illegal entrants they apprehend each year are
carrying packets of illegal documents.</tt><p>
<tt>Aliens caught entering the US with false documents are subject to fines of
up to $2,000 and five years in prison.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS in New York City indicted on October 8, 1996 three Chinese men,
affiliated with the Fuk Ching organization, on alien-smuggling charges after
intercepting a freighter loaded with more than 100 Chinese in near Bermuda-- 83
passengers and 26 crew and smugglers.  Under the new immigration law, alien
smugglers can be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison for each alien they
attempt to smuggle into the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Since 1992, more than 40 ships have been detected attempting to smuggle
Chinese to the United States, including the Golden Venture, which ran aground
off New York in 1993 with more than 280 Chinese on board.</tt><p>
<tt>Illegal Chinese immigrants typically pay $30,000 to $40,000 each to be
smuggled into the United States.  They usually make a down payment in China and
they or their families then pay off the rest once they reach their
destination.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS deported a record 67,094 illegal aliens in FY96, including 37,000
who had committed crimes in the US.  The INS, with 23,000 employees, has become
one of the largest law enforcement agencies in the US.</tt><p>
<tt><u>HIV</u>.  Several reports in October attacked the Clinton administration
for asking INS to consider granting asylum to foreigners with AIDS.  Under a
1993 law, foreigners infected with communicable diseases, including AIDS, are
barred from entering the United States and are subject to deportation if they
are located inside the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS sought to change this policy
in 1995, recommending that the INS grant asylum "based on the social group
category of HIV-positive individuals."  </tt><p>
<tt>In New York, a foreigner who was HIV-positive was granted asylum in the US,
prompting House Speaker Newt Gingrich to complain that "Under the Clinton
administration, you can come to America illegally -- sneak into the country
--announce that you are HIV-positive, be declared a political refugee, and be
eligible for $120,000 of health benefits."</tt><p>
<tt><u>Management.</u>  A federal judge in Seattle ruled on October 9, 1996
that the INS violated the 5th Amendment's due process clause by failing to
properly inform about 5,000 aliens charged with using false documents to obtain
US jobs or benefits that they have a right to a hearing to try to rebut the INS
charges.  Any alien who was caught using false documents can reopen his or her
case by "attest[ing] to his or her lack of understanding" of the INS forms,
which were published only in English.</tt><p>
<tt>The judge ruled that aliens who have already been deported, perhaps as many
as 2,500, can return to the US at their own expense to contest their
deportations.  The judge ordered the INS to publicize his decision in Central
America and South America and among the 800 nonprofit immigration assistance
providers with which the INS has established contact.</tt><p>
<tt>The 1990 Immigration and Naturalization Act made document fraud a crime
punishable by automatic and permanent deportation.  The judge ruled that INS
forms that were given to aliens caught with false documents were available only
in English, and thus did not inform aliens adequately that they were being
permanently barred from the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS has 60 days to appeal the ruling.</tt><p>
<tt>On September 12, 1996, the House Judiciary Immigration and Claims
subcommittee berated the INS for attempting to conceal from a Congressional
oversight committee overcrowding at a detention center and understaffing at the
Miami airport.  The INS officials implicated in the attempt to mislead Congress
were not helpful to the investigation.  Some, nonetheless, have been promoted
by the INS.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated one-fourth of the 720,000 immigrants "admitted" by the INS in
FY95 were living illegally in the US and adjusted their status.  Some 7.6
million foreigners are expected to apply for the 55,000 diversity visas
available in FY97.</tt><p>

Uneven Impacts</a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt><u>Food Stamps.</u>  In the omnibus spending bill, approved at the end of
September 1996 along with the new immigration law, the Clinton administration
convinced Congress to permit legal immigrants currently receiving Food Stamps
to continue getting them until April 1, 1997.  Food Stamps are entirely paid
for by the federal government; they provide an average $73 per person per month
in coupons that can be used to buy food.</tt><p>
<tt>About 1.8 million of the 25 million Food Stamp recipients are legal
immigrants.  One million are expected to be removed from the program when their
eligibility is re-checked.  States are expected to re-verify immigrant Food
Stamp recipients between April 1, 1997 and August 22, 1997.</tt><p>
<tt>On October 31, 1996, a state judge issued a preliminary injunction
forbidding California from implementing the part of the new welfare law that
makes many legal immigrants not eligible for Food Stamps until the state
government also develops procedures to notify the public of the changes.</tt><p>
<tt>About 436,000 legal immigrants receive Food Stamps in California;
immigrants are 14 percent of the 3.2 million recipients.  Some 373,000 are
expected to be removed from the rolls--legal immigrants can receive Food Stamps
only if they are active U.S. military personnel veterans; refugees who have
lived in the US less than five years; or legal immigrants have worked in the
United States for at least 10 years.</tt><p>
<tt>In California, counties administer the Food Stamp program.</tt><p>
<tt>Legal immigrants not currently receiving Food Stamps, and who applied for
Food Stamps after August 22, 1996, have had their applications rejected.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Suits</u>.  On October 15, 1996, a coalition of immigrant rights groups
in California sought an injunction from the federal judge who in 1995 blocked
implementation of Proposition 187.  The suit aimed to prevent California from
withholding prenatal care from illegal immigrant women under the new federal
welfare law.  It argued that making illegal alien women ineligible for
state-funded prenatal care would jeopardize their US-born and US-citizen
babies.</tt><p>
<tt>On November 1, 1996, the federal judge ruled that the new federal welfare
law DOES permit California to eliminate on December 1, 1996 a $69 million
program that provides prenatal care for an estimated 70,000 unauthorized
pregnant women, including 20,000 in Los Angeles.  California had been providing
prenatal care to unauthorized pregnant women since 1988.  </tt><p>
<tt>The ruling may open the door to barring unauthorized immigrants from other
state-funded programs.</tt><p>
<tt><u>General.</u>  President Clinton signed the law creating a new welfare
system into law on August 22, 1996.  States were given from October 1, 1996
through July 1, 1997 to prepare plans on the provision of assistance to poor
people.</tt><p>
<tt>Each state will receive a federal block grant to provide assistance to poor
residents.</tt><p>
<tt>Most state plans for caring for poor residents simply state that the state
will devise lawful means of assisting the poor.  A few states, including
Nebraska and Utah, said they would use state money to provide welfare
assistance to legal immigrants who arrived in the US after August 22,
1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Less than 10 percent of adult welfare recipients are now working.  Under
the new welfare law, recipients are required to work after two years of federal
welfare benefits.  Half of each state's adults on welfare are to be working by
2002.  The new law sets a five-year lifetime limit on payments to any
family.</tt><p>
<tt>The minimum wage rose to $4.25 hourly on October 1, 1996.  About 25 percent
of food-service workers are paid the minimum wage.  A full-time worker would
have to earn $7.80 per hour for 2,000 hours per<b> </b>year to push a family of
four above the $15,600 poverty line.</tt><p>

<tt><u>Population</u>.  The US Census Bureau released its projections of
California's population in October, and projected that the state would have
49.3 million residents in 2025.  In 2025, California is projected to have 21
million Hispanics, 15 million non-Hispanic whites, nine million Asians, and
three million Blacks.  </tt><p>
<tt>California's Latino population is expected to double between 1995 and 2025
and account for a third of the total Latino population in the US in 2025.
California is projected to add a net 18 million residents between 1995 and
2025, including nine million immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>The Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in mid-October
released a study that projected that California will gain a net 25,000
residents from other states in 1996, the first net population growth due to
internal migration since 1991.</tt><p>
<tt>In August, 1996 California was creating a net 25,000 new jobs each
month.<u></u></tt><p>
<tt><u>Latino Income.</u>  Pepperdine University's Institute for Public Policy
issued a report in October that argued that, after 20 years in the US, a
significant number of Latinos enter the middle class.  According to 1990 Census
data, there were nearly four times as many US-born Latino households in the
middle class in Southern California as there were in poverty.  Middle class was
defined as a household incomes above $35,000 or owning a home.</tt><p>
<tt>Latinos in 1990 were about one-third of the population of the five-county
Southern California region--Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Riverside and San
Bernardino counties--and one-fourth of all residents identified as middle
class.  Two-thirds of Latino households in Southern California are headed by
immigrants and two-thirds of the Latino households headed by recent immigrants
had household incomes of less than $35,000.  In Los Angeles County, Latino
households make up nearly 47 percent of all poor households.</tt><p>
<tt>The report paints a picture of hard-working, family-oriented people who are
gradually increasing their incomes and purchasing homes, often by pooling the
income of several persons in large households.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Housing. </u> Construction normally leads California out of recession,
with each 200,000 to 300,000 of added population typically associated with
100,000 new home starts.  The Wall Street Journal on October 10, 1996 argued
that immigrants are behind the current mini-housing boom in California.  Asians
are particularly apt to press on to home ownership.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1986, California had over 300,000 new housing starts and the net
addition of over 700,000 people, but in 1991, housing starts fell to less than
100,000 and have remained there since.  More US-born residents are leaving than
are entering California, giving the state a net loss of population due to
domestic migration of over 300,000 per year for the past five years.</tt><p>
<tt>According to housing experts, there are about three immigrants per housing
unit, versus two US-born persons per housing unit.  In some areas, such as Los
Angeles, immigrants can buy houses vacated by US-born persons leaving the area,
but in cities such as Fresno, their arrival leads to new construction.  </tt><p>
<tt>The five most common names of home buyers in the Los Angeles area in 1995
were Hispanic; Smith was the eighth most common name.</tt><p>
<tt>Since 4.5 million legal and illegal immigrants arrived in the past 16
years, the California housing industry projects the need for an additional 1.3
million housing units.  The Hispanic population of California is projected to
increase by 38 percent over the next decade, but the Hispanic population
between the ages of 35 and 54, prime home-buying ages, is projected to rise by
75 percent. </tt><p>
<tt>Latinos are optimistic.  An August, 1996 Field Poll of 553 Latinos showed
that 50 percent of the Latinos, but only 42 percent of all Californians
surveyed, believe they will be better off a year from now.  Some 54 percent of
Latinos in California earn less than $20,000 a year, compared with 30 percent
of the entire state's work force.</tt><p>
<tt>Two-thirds of California's net population growth is due to immigration.
There are about 20 million residents of southern California and over one third,
or eight million, were born abroad.  Indeed, about one third of all the
foreign-born persons in the US live in southern California.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Welfare.</u>  On January 1, 1997, payments to the 2.7 million California
recipients of Aid to Families With Dependent Children will be cut by 4.9
percent in urban areas and 9.8 percent in 41 rural counties.  An urban family
of three will see its monthly check drop about $29, to $565, and rural families
of three will get $538.</tt><p>
<tt>California began hearings around the state on implementing the new welfare
law and, at the first hearing in Fresno on October 24, 1996, local officials in
the "Valley of the poor" complained that legal immigrants removed from welfare
rolls would become the responsibility of county governments.</tt><p>
<tt>However, the state's legislative analyst predicted that, since most of the
immigrants receiving welfare in California have been in the state for at least
five years, many will apply for US citizenship to keep their benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>In Fresno county, California, the nation's major agricultural county, legal
immigrants are 14 percent of the population, but constitute one-third of those
receiving AFDC.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Schools</u>.  In Fall 1996, there were be a record 52 million children
enrolled in K-12 schools, topping a 51 million peak during the baby boom in
1971.  The enrollment surge in the 1990s is due primarily to the baby-boom
echo,--the baby boomers of the 1960s having children-- to increased immigration
and higher fertility, especially among Hispanics.</tt><p>
<tt>A new study found that more than 40 percent of the children enrolled in
K-12 education in 1996-97 are Hispanics and their share of public school
enrollment is expected to top 50 percent by the year 2004.  Relatively few
Hispanics complete high school in a manner that makes them eligible for
admission to the University of California.  For every 100 Latino students in
10th grade, only four become eligible for admission into UC, which accepts the
top 12.5 percent of high school graduates, and only one enrolls in UC.</tt><p>
<tt>California has 1.3 million K-12 children who are not fluent in English, and
the state is grappling with how to reform bilingual education.  Bilingual
education is currently governed by court cases and state regulations written
after the last bilingual education law expired in 1987.  They require that
bilingual programs must be based on sound educational theory, must be given
sufficient resources to allow that theory to make a difference and must produce
results.</tt><p>
<tt>A September 1996 poll found that 70 percent of Latino parents said teaching
children to read and write in English should be the schools' top
priority.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Labor.</u>  In September 1996, the city of Glendale near Los Angeles
began banning workers seeking day jobs and employers seeking workers from
public roads.  The city is, however, building a structure with restrooms and
chairs where day laborers can wait to be hired.  Violations of the street
hiring law can result in fines of up to $500 or six months in jail.</tt><p>
<tt>Free classes in English and job-related skills are planned for the men as
they wait for work.</tt><p>
<tt>Beginning in the mid-1980s, many southern California cities have sponsored
day labor markets to avoid worker loitering near home improvement stores.  The
city of Los Angeles is now operating two sites for day laborers, in North
Hollywood and Harbor City, but does not ban street soliciting for jobs.  In
1991, Agoura Hills banned street labor markets, its ordinance was upheld and
Ladera Heights and La Mirada soon followed with similar ordinances.</tt><p>
<tt>However, these cities have found it difficult to enforce their laws.
Studies suggest that only one-fourth to one-third of the day laborers are
unauthorized workers.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Illegal Immigration</u>.  A study released by the Public Policy
Institute of California concluded that illegal immigration from Mexico to
California reacts to changes in the economies of Mexico and California.
Demographer Hans Johnson used a variety of data to estimate the flow of illegal
immigrants to California from Mexico between 1980 and 1993.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to Johnson, illegal immigration accounted for 22 to 31 percent of
the state's population growth between 1980 and 1993.  Johnson found that when
California's economy boomed in the mid to late 1980s, the state experienced
brisk job growth and illegal immigration peaked.  When California suffered from
a severe recession in the early 1990's, illegal immigration fell. </tt><p>
<tt>In mid-June, state lawyers argued before a federal judge that California
was suffering from an "invasion" of illegal immigrants, since the estimated 1.7
to 1.8 million illegal residents in California are five percent of the state's
population.  According to the state's lawyer, an invasion is the "illegal entry
of so many persons that it is beyond the capability of the state to handle."
</tt><p>
<tt>An August 1996 survey of 1,100 Riverside county residents found that,
although 68 percent thought that illegal immigration was a "big problem," most
think that the US should continue to permit all persons born in the US to be US
citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>On October 6, 1996, the Los Angeles Times reported that California, the
only state whose Medicaid program pays for emergency hospitalization in Canada
or Mexico, was being falsely billed for hundreds of thousands of dollars by
Mexican border city doctors.</tt><p>
<tt>California in mid-1996 had 163,300 full-time state employees.  They were 58
percent non-Hispanic white, 17 percent Hispanic, 12 percent African-American
and six percent Asian.<b></b></tt><p>

Views on Immigration</a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On October 22, 1996, Mexican Foreign Relations Secretary Jose Angel Gurria
asserted that "The phenomenon of migration can be beneficial and offers great
potential advantages to both the migrants' original and new countries, but only
when a common vision on this phenomenon is reached."</tt><p>
<tt>The Sacramento Bee of October 9, 1996 noted that 40 percent of the almost
1,000 Mexicans who apply for visas to visit the US every day are turned down.
Since July 1996, Mexicans applying for non-immigrant visas to visit the US must
pay $20 each time they apply for a visa.</tt><p>
<tt>To prevent fraud, the consulate does not tell visa applicants what
materials to bring to their interviews and many must apply several
times.</tt><p>
<tt>About a third of the estimated 150,000 foreigners per year who settle
illegally after lawful entry are believed to be Mexican. </tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's population, 94 million in 1995, is rising by two million a year
and is expected to reach 125 million in 2010.  The Inter-Secretarial Commission
for the Creation and Use of Population Identification Numbers recommended in
October that Mexico adopt a "universal identification system for all
citizens."</tt><p>

<tt><u>Labor Certification.</u><b>  </b>US mathematicians holding doctorates,
whose unemployment rate jumped to almost 11 percent in 1995, are protesting the
provision of the 1990 IMMACT that increased the number of foreigners allowed to
immigrate to the US to fill vacant US jobs from 54,000 per year to 140,000 per
year.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to the protesting US mathematicians, US employers have taken
advantage of the increased number of immigration visas available.  According to
one group, 40 percent of the 720 jobs available to PhD mathematicians in 1995
went to immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, some 561 professors and researchers received US immigrant visas
because they were considered outstanding in their fields, down from 615 in
1993.   </tt><p>
<tt>The US mathematicians argue that because of easy immigration, universities
and other US employers can select from 50 or 100 equally-qualified candidates
for each opening.  </tt><p>
<tt>There is disagreement over whether intense competition for professor jobs
is helpful or harmful.  According to economist Jagdish Bhagwati, the fact that
Russian and Chinese immigrants are included in the competition for
professorships is good, since it raises the standard in mathematics departments
from research universities to community colleges.  This process highlights the
re-distributive aspects of immigration--even if all US residents gain, there
can be significant and concentrated costs.</tt><p>
<tt>The May 1996 DOL Inspector Generals' report that concluded that many US
employer requests for temporary and permanent foreign workers merely legalize
the status of a foreigner already employed continued to echo in news reports.
For example, Philadelphia Inquirer reporters Donald Barlett and James Steele on
October 20, 1996 detailed the jobs that US employers asked to fill with
temporary and permanent immigrants in 1995--a $5.25 per hour hair stylist in
Washington DC, a $15 per hour biologist for the Red Cross and a $53,000 per
year systems analyst at Perot Systems.  </tt><p>
<tt>Other jobs filled by foreigners after DOL certified that US workers were
not available included housecleaners, fast-food restaurant managers and
cooks.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b><u>Immigrant
Business</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>/a></a></a></a></a></a>es</u>.
The number of US businesses reached 17.3 million in 1992, up from 13.7 million
in 1987, and their sales topped $3.3 trillion, up from $2 trillion.  The
average US firm had sales in 1992 of $193,000.  </tt><p>
<tt>The US Census reported on July 10 that the number of Hispanic businesses in
the US increased from 490,000 in 1987 to 863,000 in 1992, and that their
receipts jumped from $33 billion to $77 billion. About 47 percent of
Hispanic-owned firms, and 45 percent of all US businesses, had annual sales in
1992 of less than $10,000, suggesting that most are sideline operations.
California has about one-third of US Hispanic-owned businesses--250,000 firms,
followed by Texas with 156,000 and Florida with 118,000.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of US firms owned by people of Asian descent increased rapidly
between 1987 and 1992, from 386,000 to 603,000.  Most of the Asian-owned firms
provide services in California, New York, and Texas.  Almost half of the
Asian-owned business are owned by persons who trace their roots to China or
Korea (not all Asian-owned businesses are immigrant-owned).</tt><p>
<tt><u>Inequality. </u> By all measures, inequality in the US has increased
over the past 20 years.  The median income of US families in real dollars fell
from $29,900 in 1989 to $27,100 in 1993.  Thus the median income was 3.25 times
the poverty level in 1989, but only three times the poverty level in
1993.</tt><p>
<tt>Over the past 20 years, the share of US jobs that paid wages too low to
keep a one-earner family above the poverty line has increased from 24 to 30
percent of all US jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Four major explanations have been advanced for increased inequality:
technological change that raised wages for educated workers and reduced them
for workers without a high school education; the shift to a service economy,
where the spread in wages is greater than in manufacturing; increased trade,
pitting US manufacturing workers more directly against lower wage workers
abroad; and increased immigration, which puts downward pressure on wages at the
bottom of the US job ladder.  There is widespread disagreement about the
percentage of inequality explained by each of these factors.</tt><p>
<tt>One recent poll reported that two-thirds of Americans blame trade and
immigration for stagnant wages and rising inequality.</tt><p>
<tt>According to a study by Occidental College, about 25 percent of the
immigrants who arrived in  California's San Fernando Valley in the 1980s had
incomes below the poverty line at the time of the 1990 census.  Of the
immigrants who arrived in the 1970s, by contrast, only 12 percent were poor in
1990.  The study concludes that immigrants are upwardly mobile. </tt><p>
<tt>A report from the California Public Policy Institute released July 14 found
that inequality among men is increasing faster in California than among men in
the US as a whole.  In 1995, men earning less than $6,000 per year were in the
bottom 10 percent of the male earners and men earning $65,000 or more were in
the top 10 percent of earners.<b></b></tt><p>

<tt>Canada anticipated the arrival of 220,000 immigrants and refugees in 1996
but, as of October, only about 160,000 had arrived.</tt><p>
<tt>The platform of Canada's governing Liberal Party calls for the annual
addition via immigration of one percent of the country's population, which
would mean about 300,000 immigrants per year.  However, Canada publishes an
expected level of immigration each year and, for 1997, it expects to admit
between 195,000 and 220,000.  About 113,000 will be economic migrants, persons
admitted under a system that awards points for education and skills, 61,000 are
family unification immigrants and 26,000 are refugees.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1971 Canada launched a national policy of multiculturalism.  A Ministry
of Multiculturalism was established in 1973, and in 1982, the Canadian Charter
or constitution was amended to say that it should be interpreted to preserve
and enhance "the multicultural heritage of Canadians."  The Canadian government
was pledged by law in 1988 to preserve and enhance multiculturalism.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Liberal government recently reaffirmed multiculturalism despite
widespread criticism that state-funded multiculturalism is accelerating the
break-up of Canada.  Toronto in 1996 won the United Nations' Best Practices
Award for the integration and celebration of immigrants.  </tt><p>
<tt>A recent poll in the Vancouver Sun found that many immigrants from Hong
Kong believe they are victims of racism.  Some analysts say the racism stems
from reactions of jealousy from the native community over the wealth of the

<tt>An estimated 700,000 Dominicans, almost 10 percent of the 7.5 million
population of the Dominican Republic, are believed to have emigrated since
1985.  About 400,000 were admitted as legal immigrants to the US.  Over half of
these settled in New York City.</tt><p>
<tt>The Dominican Republic receives an estimated $1 billion in remittances each
year.</tt><p>
<tt>More Dominicans receive public assistance than any other non-refugee group
of immigrants.  About 28 percent of the Dominican immigrants who arrived since
1980 have received public assistance for some period of time.  Only Vietnamese,
at 38 percent, and persons from the ex-USSR, at 33 percent, have higher rates
of dependence on public assistance. </tt><p>
<tt>Dominican President Leonel Fernandez Reyna, who took office in August,
1996, acknowledged in September 1996 that "many Dominican families residing in
the United States that have benefited from welfare and food stamps will begin
to experience difficulties once this law is promulgated."  Reyna, who went to
elementary and high school in New York City, urged Dominicans in the US to
become US citizens to retain their benefits; the Dominican Republic made dual
citizenship legal in 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt>In Reyna's words: "If you... feel the need to adopt the nationality of the
United States in order to confront the vicissitudes of that society stemming
from the end of the welfare era, do not feel tormented by this.... Do it with a
peaceful conscience, for you will continue being Dominicans, and we will
welcome you as such when you set foot on the soil of our republic."</tt><p>
<tt>The US Coast Guard reports that growing numbers of poor people from the
Dominican Republic are hiring smugglers to take them on the 18-hour sea journey
to Puerto Rico.  Those who establish themselves in the US commonwealth have a
foothold into the US.  The Coast Guard has picked up 4,162 Dominicans at sea in
1996, about the same as in 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>The 14-nation Caribbean Community or Caricom wants the US to grant the

<tt><u>Third Pillar</u>.  The European Union agreed on October 2, 1996 to move
from unanimity to majority decision-making on immigration, border control,
asylum and visa issues, leaving Britain isolated in its refusal to give up its
veto on such issues.  </tt><p>
<tt>EU decisions relating to home and judicial affairs under the third pillar
of the Maastricht treaty are currently required to be unanimous.  Majority rule
would be coupled with the right of the EU commission to propose legislation and
make immigration decisions subject to scrutiny by the European parliament.
</tt><p>
<tt>In addition, the proposed new structure for dealing with third pillar
issues would make the European Court of Justice responsible for settling
disputes.  Britain is opposed to any extension of the court's jurisdiction.  If
Britain does not change its position after its expected April, 1997 elections,
the other 14 members of the EU will move ahead without Britain. </tt><p>
<tt>In an October 18 speech, an EU leader called on the European Union to focus
on human rights as the key element of a preventive refugee policy.  He said
that the EU provides humanitarian funds to care for refugees, but does not have
a plan to stop refugee flows before they begin.  </tt><p>
<tt>Second, he said that the UNHCR should rewrite its refugee convention,
adopted 44 years ago, to take into account the social realities of population
displacements today, which are often caused by civil discord, rather than
individual persecution by governments.  </tt><p>
<tt>Third, he called upon the IGC to grant the European Court of Justice
supervisory powers over EU asylum policy in order to guarantee that asylum
seekers will not be returned to unsafe territories.  Currently the European
Court of Justice has no jurisdiction over asylum decisions made by individual
EU nations.</tt><p>
<tt>France in October rejected a proposal made by the 39-member Council of
Europe that advocates a smaller role for national parliaments in dealing with
immigration.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>Britain in October asked the UN to consider recommending that member
nations deny asylum to persons "financing, planning and inciting terrorist
acts."  Critics say that, if the British amendments to the 1951 Geneva refugee
convention were adopted, Nelson Mandela could have been denied asylum in Europe
and extradited to South Africa as a terrorist.</tt><p>
<tt>Denmark, Sweden and Finland became full members of the Schengen pact that
opens internal European borders.  Norway and Iceland, both non-EU members, are
associate members, but they pledged to implement some EU legislation, such as
EU guidelines on asylum and visa policy.  </tt><p>
<tt>Italy, Austria and Greece hope to become full members of the Schengen
agreement in 1997.</tt><p>
<tt>French officials continue to work on an accord with the Netherlands to
control drug sales, so that France would drop its land border controls with
Belgium and Luxembourg.  French officials continue to accuse the two countries
of being transit areas through which Dutch drugs enter France. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Population and Unemployment</u>.  The population of the 15-member EU,
including resident foreigners, reached 373 million on January 1, 1996.  In the
EU, fertility was less than 1.9 births per woman ranging from 1.9 in Ireland to
1.2 in Italy.  There were about four million births and 3.7 million deaths in
the EU in 1995, for a natural increase of 300,000.</tt><p>
<tt>The total population of the EU rose by 800,000 because a net 500,000
immigrants arrived, including 422,000 in Germany and 90,000 in the UK.  Ireland
and Portugal were net emigration countries.</tt><p>
<tt>Unemployment in the EU is not likely to fall as EU nations struggle to
satisfy the Maastricht requirements for monetary union.  With an unemployment
rate that is twice the US rate, it may be hard for EU nations to develop
immigration policies that anticipate the entry of foreigners seeking jobs, even
though every EU country reports shortages of workers with particular
skills.</tt><p>
<tt>The Irish director of the EURES (European Employment Services) asserted in
October that there were only two ways to reduce unemployment-- "educate and
migrate."  Among EU countries, those with the highest unemployment rates have
the lowest levels of worker skills and therefore the least mobility.</tt><p>
<tt>In some cases, there is cross-border migration in Europe to take advantage
of wage and tax differences between member countries.  For example, hundreds of
Swedish nurses reportedly live in Malmo, Sweden and commute daily to jobs in
Copenhagen where wages are higher. Sweden is attractive because of lower income
taxes.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>EU member countries must give nationals of other EU member states
three-month work and residence permits upon request. But there is no obligation
to renew the work and residence permit if the worker does not find
employment.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the Council of Europe, Luxembourg has the highest percentage
of foreigners in its population, 32 percent; followed by Switzerland, 19
percent; Germany, nine percent; France, six percent; and the UK, four
percent.</tt><p>
<tt>EU labor and social affairs ministers agreed on September 24, 1996 that an
EU employer who sends workers to another EU country must abide by the labor
laws of the country to which the workers are sent, including paying minimum
wages to EU migrant workers.  The new rules are aimed at preventing "social
dumping," or taking advantage of wage differences within the EU by using
low-wage workers in high-wage countries.</tt><p>
<tt>The European Court of Justice ruled on October 10, 1996 that spouses of
workers entitled under German law to child-rearing benefits may receive those
benefits whether or not they live in Germany.  Germany had argued that the
benefit was originally intended for single parent families and not to benefit
spouses residing outside of Germany.  The court said that if a benefit is
granted without "individual and discretionary assessment of personal needs and
if it concerns one of the risks expressly listed in the community regulation,"
it is subject to the Community regulations for migrant workers. </tt><p>
<tt>The UK and Portugal dissented.  All EU nations will have three years to
implement the agreement.<b></b></tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt><u>Bosnians.</u>  Under an August 1996 agreement between the 16 German
states and the Interior Ministry in Bonn, a three-phase repatriation program
began October 1, 1996 for the 320,000 Bosnians refugees in Germany.  Criminals,
single people and childless couples are to leave Germany by March 1997.
</tt><p>
<tt>Some predict that the expulsion orders will push Bosnians underground in
Germany, as many try to stay without legal residence papers.</tt><p>
<tt>Bavaria, Thuringia, Baden-Wurttemberg and Berlin have announced plans to
remove the Bosnians by force if necessary.</tt><p>
<tt>On October 9, 1996, Bavaria forcibly expelled a 29-year old Bosnian who had
been convicted of sexual offenses.  He had applied for amnesty in January 1996;
the application had been rejected.</tt><p>
<tt>The Chicago Tribune profiled a Serb-Croat woman in Berlin who was raped and
beaten by Muslims as she tried to escape from Bosnia and who was the first of
615 Bosnians in a former East Berlin workers' hostel to receive a notice to
leave Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>The woman does not want to return and reportedly is considering seeking
political asylum in the Netherlands.  But European Union rules make the first
EU country's decision on an asylum applicant binding on all other
members.</tt><p>
<tt>Berlin has nearly 30,000 Bosnian refugees.  Berlin's interior minister said
that Berlin will not send home rape victims and others traumatized by the war
until after their medical treatment is completed, but that a majority of the
Bosnian refugees should be returned by the end of 1999.  The interior minister
estimates that caring for the Bosnians costs Berlin between $460 million and
$525 million a year. </tt><p>
<tt>On October 10, 1996, Germany and what remains of Yugoslavia signed an
agreement to repatriate over the next three years 135,000 persons whose
applications for asylum in Germany were rejected.  Many are ethnic Albanians
from Kosovo.  The Yugoslav interior minister acknowledged that the return of
this many people will create difficulties and hoped that the international
community would help with resettlement costs, since Yugoslavia did not demand
financial assistance from Germany as a condition for taking back its citizens.
</tt><p>
<tt>German interior minister Kanther said that the treaty, which is effective
December 1, signals Germany's determination not to allow individuals without
legitimate claims to political asylum to remain in the country for extended
periods.  The accord provides for the return within three years of all refugees
from the former Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) who entered Germany before
the October 10 signing. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Asylum Seekers</u>.  The number of foreigners seeking asylum in Germany
was 10,742 in September, 1996, compared with 9,548 in August.  Between January
and September, some 86,643 people applied for asylum in Germany, a drop of six
percent from 1995 levels.  Of the asylum applications adjudicated, 7.5 percent
the applicants were granted asylum in Germany. </tt><p>
<tt>After 19 months of refuge in a church in Nuremberg, a Turkish family
voluntarily returned to Turkey.  About 150 foreigners, including 50 in Bavaria,
have taken "refuge" in churches.</tt><p>
<tt>Under "Altfallregelungen"--old cases rules--families in Germany six or more
years who can support themselves can continue living in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of Aussiedler--ethnic Germans moving from the ex-USSR to
Germany--fell from 151,000 in the first nine months of 1995 to 129,300 in the
first nine months of 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The German Sports Federation has pledged to reduce the number of requests
it makes to have foreigners naturalized so that they can play on German teams.
The current number of 50 per year is to be reduced to five.</tt><p>

New Immigration Legislation</a></a></a></a>?
</a></h2>
<tt>The French government in October proposed legislation to crack down on
immigrants employed in the underground economy.  If enacted into law, France
would offer legal residence rights to illegal immigrants who have a French
spouse or French children, or have been employed in France for at least 15
years, or would face serious danger if sent home.  The bill does not offer
permanent residence to illegal immigrant parents of children born in
France.</tt><p>
<tt>French leftists and human rights groups criticized the proposed immigration
reforms.  One the one hand, the new law would boost state controls on foreign
residents and reduce judicial safeguards that prevent deportation.  </tt><p>
<tt>On the other hand, the legislation would remove provisions from immigration
law that have deprived some immigrants of residence rights.  These provisions
led to the recent protests by African immigrants who occupied a Paris church.
</tt><p>
<tt>On October 26, between 100 to 150 protesters took over a Paris center for
foreigners to demand residence permits and a halt to expulsions.  </tt><p>
<tt>French sociologist Claude-Valentin Marie, in an October 15, 1996 Le Monde
article, argued that the government's attempt to crack down on illegal
immigration might damage the French economy.  The article pointed out that
legal and illegal immigrant workers serve as shock absorbers during economic
restructuring and argued that reducing the number of flexible immigrant workers
may therefore make restructuring more difficult.</tt><p>
<tt>The report put the total number of foreign workers dismissed from heavy
manufacturing industry jobs between 1973 and 1988 at 500,000.  Many laid-off
foreign workers entered the underground economy.  According to Marie, 90
percent of those employed in the underground economy are French citizens or
legal immigrants.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The National Front, the political party with the slogan "France for
the French," is only about 15 years old, but it won 15 percent of the vote in
the first round of the 1995 presidential elections, and it frequently wins 30
to 35 percent of the vote in local elections.  The National Front has attracted
support among police and transportation workers.</tt><p>
<tt>On October 16, the National Assembly approved an amendment that would allow
the government to prosecute under anti-racism laws statements that do not
single out a particular race or religion when making derogatory
comments.</tt><p>
<tt>On October 20, about 30 Africans evicted from a Paris church two months ago
briefly re-occupied the building, protesting tough immigration measures that
are keeping them in a legal limbo.  Police ringed the church and by late
afternoon the Africans left. </tt><p>
<tt>French police arrested 17 people who brought in hundreds of illegal
immigrants from Sri Lanka over the past eight years.  The illegal immigrants
paid about $800 to be flown from Sri Lanka to Kiev, and then be driven to
France through Poland, Germany and Switzerland.  They were then housed in Paris
suburbs and given forged documents to show in applying for political asylum.
</tt><p>
<tt>Sri Lankans who find themselves stranded in Poland simply apply for asylum
there.  In one week in September, about 700 illegal immigrants were caught in
Poland, including 168 in two houses in a village near Warsaw.  Most applied for
asylum in order to prevent their immediate deportation.  Poland's Ministry of
Internal Affairs estimates the number of illegal aliens in Poland at 100,000 to
200,000.<b></b></tt><p>

Expects Increase in Immigration
</a></h2>
<tt>The Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics reported on October 8, 1996 that the
improving economic climate of the Netherlands is expected to increase
immigration 11 percent in 1996.  Immigration fell sharply in 1994 after
stricter rules were introduced. </tt><p>
<tt>Most immigrants to the Netherlands come from Germany, the United Kingdom,
Turkey, Morocco and Surinam.  The number of immigrants from Turkey, Morocco and
Surinam is expected to rise by 32, 48 and 52 per cent between 1995 and 1996,
respectively, while an eight per cent rise in immigrants is expected from the
Netherlands Antilles and Aruba.</tt><p>
<tt>The Netherlands, long known for toleration, is beginning to take steps that
some see as necessary to integrate foreigners, and others see as racism.  One
politician proposed that all foreigners from outside the European Union wishing
to live permanently in Holland would have to learn Dutch and take "lessons in
social assimilation and career guidance courses."</tt><p>
<tt>The number of asylum seekers in 1994 reached 52,576, in part because the
Netherlands was perceived to be more generous than neighboring countries.  As
the Netherlands cracked down on asylum seekers, many were detained in a
converted army barracks known as Willem II that was opened to asylum seekers in
May 1994.  There have been a series of hunger strikes and suicides by asylum
seekers protesting what they say is very harsh treatment.</tt><p>
<tt>In the Netherlands,  illegal immigrants are subject to the provisions of
the Dutch criminal law, and thus, can be ordered to work while detained.  In
the spring of 1996, the Netherlands was holding 700 asylum seekers, mostly
North Africans. </tt><p>
<tt>Morocco asked the Dutch government to legalize the status of the Moroccans
living in the country without proper documentation.  Nearly 200,000 Moroccans
live in the Netherlands.</tt><p>
<tt>Dutch police on October 16 announced the arrest of 30 people who ran a
worldwide alien smuggling network.  One smuggler made travel arrangements for
Iraqis and Iranians to fly to the Ukraine or Austria, where they would be
supplied with forged documents and an airline ticket to the Netherlands.  Other
members of the smuggling ring would help the illegal immigrants with asylum
applications in the Netherlands.  Many of the smuggled immigrants went on to
Canada after a short stay in the Netherlands. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC19">Migration
between Two Koreas</a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>China and South Korea are reportedly building refugee camps to handle what
some expect to be a hunger-induced mass emigration from North Korea of up to
five million people this winter.  South Korea's Ministry of National
Unification has sought 4.6 billion won ($5.6 million) in the fiscal 1997 budget
to build a refugee camp south of Seoul.</tt><p>
<tt>In recent years, about 100 North Koreans have moved to South Korea each
year.  It is easier for North Koreans to move to China, because that border is
not heavily mined: 1,000 North Koreans are believed to have moved to China
since 1992, blending into ethnic Korean communities in the Chinese border
provinces of Jilin and Liaoning.  </tt><p>
<tt>But those who are caught meet a harsh fate.  Under a 1986 treaty, illegal
North Koreans apprehended in China are returned to North Korea, where most are
executed.  In some cases, an entire village is punished for the defection of
one villager.  Within North Korea, there is reported to be a reverse migration
from cities to farms in search of food.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 400 North Koreans are refusing to return home from logging camps in
the Russian Far East.</tt><p>
<tt>North Korea has offered resort and beach facilities for the hundreds of
South Korean workers expected to enter the country when construction of its new
nuclear reactors begins later in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The South Korean Ministry of Labor is currently drafting a new foreign
labor employment act which would extend basic labor rights to foreign workers
if their employment was approved by the government.  The act would also require
employers with foreign workers to post a bond with a bank or insurance company
that would be refunded when the foreign worker returns to his/her native
country. </tt><p>
<tt>South Korea is considering hiring foreign workers to construct the
country's first high-speed train line.  An official at the Ministry of
Construction and Transportation said that foreign workers were needed because
of high wages and labor shortages.  In addition to South Korean workers, 570
foreign workers will be employed for three years, beginning in 1997. </tt><p>
<tt>The government hopes to complete the 250-mile track in time for the 2002
World Soccer Cup.  Japan and South Korea will share the World Cup soccer
tournament in 2002, with half of the games to be played in each country.
</tt><p>
<tt>Both countries are already making plans to change their immigration laws to
facilitate the movement of players, trainers and fans between the two countries
without unleashing illegal immigration.  South Koreans currently need a visa to
visit Japan, while South Korea permits Japanese visitors to enter South Korea
for up to 15 days without a visa.</tt><p>
<tt>In January 1996, there were 135,686 foreign workers in South Korea,
including 51,301 legal workers and 84,385 illegal workers.  At the end of May,
1996, according to government estimates, the number of illegal foreign workers
had risen to 100,000, accounting for 60 percent of the foreign workers in the
country.  </tt><p>
<tt>The legal foreign workers included 8,539 professional and technological
personnel, and 42,762 industrial technology trainees.  Most of the illegal
migrant workers are from China and other Asian countries.  Many of the foreign
workers from China are ethnic Koreans. </tt><p>
<tt>South Korea's labor shortages were most acute in 1991, when almost 10
percent of all manufacturing jobs were vacant.  In 1992, the government
reported that 61,126 illegal foreigners were working in South Korea.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1993, 20,000 foreign trainees were admitted and in February 1996, the
trainee quota was raised to 70,000.  Trainees come from 12 Asian countries,
including China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar
(Burma), Sri Lanka, Nepal and Pakistan.</tt><p>
<tt>South Korea plans a crackdown on illegal foreign workers in November 1996.
The crackdown will focus on service industries such as restaurants,
entertainment venues and factories.  Two similar crackdowns in the past 12
months resulted in the deportation of 8,500 illegal foreign workers. </tt><p>
<tt>There are three types of illegal foreign workers in South Korea.  Most are
foreigners who enter South Korea on tourist visas and then go to work.  The
second type enters South Korea on a false passport or is smuggled into the
country and hopes to stay and work.</tt><p>
<tt>The third type of illegal foreigner is a trainee who abandons the
traineeship to work illegally.  As of January 1996, about 12,000 foreigners
left their traineeships to work illegally.  </tt><p>
<tt>South Korea's economy is expected to grow by 6.5 percent in 1996, down from
nine percent in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>South Korean-owned factories outside Korea have a reputation for harsh
treatment of local workers.  South Korean companies invested $2.75 billion
abroad in 1995, but from China to Vietnam to Argentina, local workers complain
that their Korean managers vigorously resist unions, demean workers and expect
overly hard work.  They may have local government support in this:  In
Pakistan, a South Korean construction firm sent a letter to police listing the
names of union-sympathizer employees  and all were detained.</tt><p>
<tt>South Koreans own sewing and apparel shops around the world.  In Argentina,
South Korean-owned textile firms typically hire illegal Bolivian immigrant day
laborers for $3 per day and do not pay social security or other taxes.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>In September 1996, Singapore reached its highest-ever level of foreign
worker employment, when the 350,000 foreign workers reached 20 percent of the
country's 1.7 million work force.</tt><p>
<tt>The government in 1996 launched campaigns against illegal immigration and
to promote on the job safety.  One result is that many contractors are
requesting one- to two-month extensions on construction projects because their
sub-contractors cannot find enough workers. </tt><p>
<tt>The number of illegal immigrants apprehended has been rising.  An average
of 580 illegal immigrants and overstayers were arrested each month between
March and September, 1996.  Heavy fines have not deterred the employment of
illegal workers, including a $1.5 million fine for having 188 illegal foreign
workers at one job site.</tt><p>
<tt>Singapore's Minister for Home Affairs began a Construction Safety campaign
on October 12, 1996 to improve the safety of foreign workers on the job.  In
1996, there has been an average of one fatal accident a week involving foreign

each month.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC21">Malaysia</a></a></a></a></a>:
 Recruitment </a>Ban
Continues</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced on October 12 that the
government would continue the ban on permits to import unskilled foreign
workers first imposed on July 10, 1996.  Malaysia still needs foreign workers,
Anwar said, but labor-short companies should recruit illegal immigrants from
detention centers.  According to Anwar, "if they [employers] need  foreign
workers they can always go to the camps and hire these [illegal]
people."</tt><p>
<tt>However, of the 37,000 detained illegal workers available to employers in
October 1996, only 3,000 were hired.  Most Malaysian companies say that the
illegal aliens in detention centers have too few skills.</tt><p>
<tt>Employers with illegal foreign workers are supposed to register them with
the Immigration Department by December 31, 1996 and to have a physical
exam.</tt><p>
<tt>Employers can continue to apply for permission to import skilled foreign
workers, with applications considered on a case-by-case basis.</tt><p>
<tt>Anwar said there were 750,000 foreign workers with work permits in Malaysia
and one million illegal aliens.  The legal foreign workers include 306,000 from
Indonesia and 117,500 Bangladeshis; others are from the Philippines, Thailand,
Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Burma.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Anwar, Malaysia will reduce the number of foreign workers to
reduce the social problems they cause.  There have been several clashes in 1996
between Bangladeshis and Malays.  Anwar asked Indonesia and Bangladesh to
cooperate by preventing the movement of their nationals to Thailand on their
way to Malaysia.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian Human Resources minister also warned employers that they face
sanctions if they lay off Malaysian workers before dismissing foreign workers.
The government is investigating two factories in Jahor that laid off 87 Malays
and retained 119 foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>In order to speed up repatriations and encourage the hiring of illegal
workers in detention, Malaysia began requiring employers bringing foreign
workers into the country to pay a fee equivalent to repatriation expenses for
25 per cent of the number of workers who arrive, e.g., to admit 100 foreign
workers, the employer must pay for the repatriation of 25.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia is a country of 19 million with a labor force of eight million,
including one to two million foreigners.  The Malaysian Trades Union Congress
estimates three million foreign workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>The economy has been growing at an annual rate of eight to nine percent,
the labor force at an annual rate of two to three percent and employment at an
annual rate of three to four percent.  One result of rapid economic and job
growth are labor shortages, estimated to be five to 10 percent of current
employment in plantation agriculture (250,000 employees) and manufacturing (1.4
million employees).  </tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia has had a stop-go policy on foreign worker recruitment.  On
October 16, 1991, the Malaysian government announced an "amnesty" that
permitted the employers of illegal alien workers to register them and pay a fee
of M$420 in most cases, and some 447,000 illegal aliens--equivalent to six
percent of Malaysian employment--registered by June 30, 1992.  </tt><p>
<tt>In April 1993, unskilled foreign worker recruitment was suspended but,
after employers protested the recruitment freeze was lifted for manufacturers
in June 1993.  On January 7, 1994, recruitment of unskilled and semi-skilled
workers from outside the country was stopped, but was later permitted on a
sector-by-sector basis.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The New Straits Times reported on October 9, 1996 that two-thirds of
1996 Malaysian employer requests for 210,249 foreign workers, including 106,000
of 141,300 requests from the manufacturing sector, have been approved.</tt><p>
<tt>On October 18, 1996, Malaysia announced proposals that would increase
penalties to deter illegal immigrants, including a proposal to cane illegal
workers and their employers if they are caught twice.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under current law, illegal immigrants face RM$1,000 ($400) fines, several
months imprisonment and deportation, while Malaysian employers face fines of
$800 and imprisonment for several months.  The new penalties are expected to be
approved by parliament before the end of 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>On October 28, Malaysian officials reported that nearly 30,000 Bangladeshis
were massing in southern Thailand in a bid to illegally enter Malaysia.  Many
were trying to enter Malaysia through the hills along the border or by sea.
The Malaysian government mobilized about 6,000 members from the civilian
national guard to help police the Malaysian-Thai border.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many Indonesians and Bangladeshis are smuggled into Malaysia on fishing
boats for fees that average about $1,000.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian press blames foreign workers for committing a
disproportionate number of crimes.  However, of the 10,623 serious crimes
committed in Malaysia in 1995, 628 were committed by foreign workers.  Of the
70,798 minor crimes, 2,197 involved foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>The Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers advised its member-employers to
be more diligent when hiring foreign workers.  Some Malaysian firms are paid
RM1,000 ($400) for each foreign worker they hire from a recruitment agency,
which allegedly encourages the hiring of unauthorized foreign workers.
According the International Trade and Industry ministry, some company officers
were allegedly receiving under-the-table payments for recruiting foreign
workers from certain agents.  The official said that this may explain why
companies are not hiring detained illegal aliens who have been given work
permits.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the government, Bangladeshi workers are subject to criticism
because of their social differences and their tendency to marry local women.
The government printed pamphlets "to educate women on the consequences they
will have to face if they still decide to marry foreigners."  One Malaysian
government minister said that marriages of convenience by Bangladeshi and
Indian foreign workers would increase social problems in the Malaysia.  </tt><p>

problems."</tt><p>

<tt><u>Foreign Workers</u>.  According to the Interior Ministry, of the 590,000
illegal immigrants in Thailand in mid-1995, about 300,000 came from Burma,
100,000 from China, and 10,000 each from Cambodia and Laos.</tt><p>
<tt>Under new rules, employers are required to legalize their illegal workers
by paying a fee and registering them with the Immigration Police.  The
legalized migrants will be granted two work permits and only those employed in
agriculture, construction, fishing and water transportation can be
legalized.</tt><p>
<tt>As of October 11, only 27,536 immigrant workers had been registered and
passed medical examinations, less than four per cent of the estimated illegal
labor force of 700,000.  Most employers complain that the 5,000 baht (US$200)
registration fee is to stiff. </tt><p>
<tt>On November 17, a new general election will be held in Thailand and many
wonder it the legalization program will be continued by a new government.
</tt><p>
<tt>When the government legalized the presence of many illegal immigrants in
June 1996, trade unions protested that foreign workers put downward pressure on
wages. </tt><p>
<tt>Bangkok has become the Asian hub for organizing travel for illegal Chinese
immigrants to Europe and the US.  Stolen passports, primarily from Korea and
Japan, are sent to Bangkok and sold for $2,000 to $3,000 each.  Genuine
passports from Bolivia, Honduras, Argentina and Belize can be bought for
$12,000 to $32,000.</tt><p>
<tt>Smugglers can fly a Chinese migrant to the US from Beijing as a bogus
member of a trade delegation for about $18,000.  Ships have lost their
popularity because of the difficulty entering ports without detection. </tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, investigators found that a subcontractor hired by shoe giant
Reebok was paying ethnic Karen refugees from Burma working in Thailand less
than half of the minimum wages paid their Thai counterparts.</tt><p>
<tt>A professor at Mahidol University in Thailand told a seminar on October 5,
1996 that the government should not attempt to lure foreign investors with
offers of cheap labor.  He found that in a random survey most foreigners are
paid a quarter of what their Thai counterparts earn for the same jobs.  This
situation, he added, might subject Thailand to trade sanctions by Western
countries who regard labor exploitation as a violation of human rights.  The
Thailand Development Research Institute is now completing a study on the
advantages and disadvantages of employing foreign workers.  </tt><p>
<tt><u>Internal Migration</u>.  On October 13, 1996, some Thai workers held a
march to demand that migrant Thai workers be allowed to vote at their work
places.   There are believed to be five million internal migrant workers who
are employed away from the address where they are registered as living and
voting.  Since voting in Thailand must be done in person, many will not be able
to vote in the November 17 general election.</tt><p>
<tt>Unions asked that internal migrants be able to use their employer's address
and vote where they are employed. </tt><p>
<tt>Thailand raised its daily minimum wage to 157 baht ($6.19) on October 1,
1996.<b></b></tt><p>

<tt>Vietnam in October 1996 announced new rules for the employment of
foreigners.  Foreigners working in joint venture and wholly foreign-owned
companies will be limited to a stay of three years in the country and
foreign-owned companies will be required to train local replacements for their
foreign staff.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most foreigners with business visas will also have to apply for work
permits.  Those exempt from the new rules include diplomats, employees of
non-government organizations, foreign media and executives in company
representative offices. </tt><p>
<tt>About two million Vietnamese live outside Vietnam, including one million in
the US.  Overseas Vietnamese remit an estimated $600 to $700 million annually.
Vietnam hopes that its Diaspora will stimulate foreign investment.  Some
265,000 "Viet kieu" returned for at least brief visits in 1995, but they
registered only 58 investment projects, worth about $100 million.</tt><p>

<tt>The United Arab Emirates in October continued to expel thousands of illegal
migrants, leading, in at least one case, to labor shortages.  Foreigners make
up about 75 percent of the 2.4 million population in the UAE.  </tt><p>
<tt>Illegal foreign workers were ordered to leave the UAE in August and the
original September 30, 1996 deadline was extended to October 31, 1996.  Most of
the illegal workers are from India, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Sri Lanka,
Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran.  Most arrived legally and then stayed after
their visas expired or illegally changed jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>The UAE reports that as of early October, some 145,000 foreigners from
India, the Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Iran had left.
Many of the Indians wishing to leave cannot afford the airfare home, so the
Indian government is sending boats to bring Indian workers home.  The Indian
state of Kerala expects about 30,000 migrants to return from the UAE.</tt><p>

including fines of up to 30,000 dirhams ($8,200) and three years in jail.  Boat
owners bringing illegal aliens into the country face up to 15 years in prison
and fines of between 15,000 dirhams and 100,000 dirhams ($4,100 -
$27,000).</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippine government reports that about 6,000 Filipinos in the UAE
plan to leave before the October 31, 1996 deadline.  Three out of four
Filipinos working abroad are the sole supporter of their families.  The Manila
labor monitor, Migrante, found that within one month of their return, most
foreign workers are broke.  Many of the Filipinos who leave the UAE are
expected to seek employment in other countries. </tt><p>
<tt>King Fahd of Saudi Arabia on October 21 called on Saudi private businesses
to employ more Saudi workers.  The announcement came three days after the Saudi
government refused to renew residency permits for foreign workers in 13
occupations, including guards, receptionists and administrators.   </tt><p>
<tt>Saudi Arabia in October 1996 barred foreign laborers from driving or owning
cars, according to the Filipino Overseas Workers Welfare Administration.
Foreigners classified as watchmen and servants are not affected by the ban.
There are about 600,000 Filipinos working in Saudi Arabia as domestic helpers,
manual laborers and technicians.</tt><p>

<tt>Throughout Africa in 1996, illegal immigrants were expelled by countries
who blamed them for everything from spreading AIDS to crime and unemployment.
Rising unemployment in immigrant-dependent Middle Eastern countries lead to the
expulsion of tens of thousands of immigrants from Saudi Arabia and migrant
workers in other Middle Eastern countries face increased work permit fees and
other measures aimed at reducing immigrant numbers.</tt><p>
<tt>South Africa, with a per capita income of $3,000--is attracting immigrants
from other parts of Africa. The stock of immigrants is estimated at two to four
million.  The major countries of origin include Mozambique, with a per capita
income of less than $100, Malawi and Zaire.  </tt><p>
<tt>In October 1996, South Africa announced that it would tighten visa issuance
procedures after more than 90 000 Zimbabweans violated the terms of their
six-month visas in 1995-96.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the illegal African migrants work in the informal sector of South
Africa's economy as street peddlers or day laborers.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 22, 1996, the South African government announced that foreigners
without "special skills" would be banned from working in the country.</tt><p>
<tt>Polls suggest that most South Africans associate illegal immigrants with
unemployment, homelessness and crime.  However, many of the countries of origin
sheltered African National Congress members during apartheid and South Africa
recently agreed to Mozambique's request that it slow down the deportation of
illegal Mozambicans.</tt><p>
<tt>South Africa granted a temporary right to stay for nationals of Rwanda,
Burundi, Somalia, Angola, Ethiopia and Liberia.  This gives nationals of Zaire
and Mozambique incentives to claim that they are from one of these
nations.</tt><p>
<tt>South Africa is considering an amnesty, a guest worker program or an
arrangement in which increased aid to neighboring countries is tied to
stepped-up enforcement.</tt><p>
<tt>South Africa still employs about 170,000 foreign miners to work in gold and
diamond mines.  In September 1996, wages were raised eight to 13 percent for
190,000 miners.</tt><p>
<tt>There has been a dramatic increase in emigration by South Africans with
professional or technical skills.  There was a first quarter increase of 27
percent in 1996 of the total number of emigrants over the same period last
year.  The number of immigrants in the same period decreased by 21 percent.
Some observers say that rising crime and fears about education standards are
causing the increased emigration and decreased immigration rates.

<tt>Zimbabwe will refuse to renew work permits for foreigner professionals to

Bassa, Songo, in Mozambique's Tete Province, 900 Mozambican workers staged a
sit in at a dam-power plant to protest the higher wages and benefits paid to
Portuguese workers.</tt><p>
<tt>In August, 1996 Angolan police arrested more than 800 illegal immigrants in
a crackdown on illegal immigrants in the province of Luanda.  Called Operation
Cancer III, illegal immigrants from Mali, Lebanon and Senegal have been
deported.  The police plan to extend the operation to other provinces in the to
arrest illegal immigrants reportedly from Bulgaria, Russia and Portugal.</tt><p>
<tt>More than 1,000 foreigners were arrested in Luanda Norte province during
the past six months.  Most were Zairians involved in diamond smuggling.
</tt><p>
<tt>Gambia used to be considered the gateway to Europe and the United States.
Many African migrants went to Gambia because of the country's open-door policy
for professionals.  </tt><p>
<tt>Relatively high salaries attracted medical doctors, lawyers and
accountants, but most of the Ghanaians, Nigerians, Guineans, Sierra Leoneans
and Liberians in Gambia are teachers who planned to use Gambia as a stepping
stone to Europe or the US, but were unable to get visas and remained.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many were lured to Gambia by stories of West African professionals,
especially teachers, who ended up in Europe, Canada or the US after working for
a year or two in Gambia.  The rising cost of living in Gambia and stepped up
enforcement in Europe, Canada and the US, has encouraged some foreign teachers
to return home, or to try their luck in neighboring Senegal.  Some try to reach
Spain from Senegal via Mauritania and Morocco.</tt><p>
<tt>Both poverty and wealth have increased in Egypt since 1991 when the country
opened itself to foreign trade and investment.  Egypt has 61 million people
with an average income of $750 per year; 57 percent of the population lived
below the poverty line of $226 per person per year in 1990-91.</tt><p>
<tt>At the other extreme, the richest six million Egyptians had about 28
percent of the country's national income.</tt><p>

Race Debate Heats Up
</a></h2>
<tt>On October 30, Australia's political leaders issued a joint statement in
the Parliament opposing racism.  The debate on race in Australia was sparked
by, a September 10, 1996 speech by a newly elected member of Parliament that
called for a moratorium on immigration, since Australia was "in danger of being
swamped by Asians."</tt><p>
<tt>On October 31, Pauline Hanson, a Queensland MP, challenged the government
by demanding a referendum on immigration and multiculturalism.  Hanson issued a
statement saying she supported parts of the statement opposing racism, but
vowed to continue her anti-Asian immigration and anti-Aboriginal funding
message.  Recent polls show that as many as two-thirds of Australians back her
call for a halt to immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of immigrants arriving in Australia rose to 99,139 in the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1996.  The three leading countries of origin were New
Zealand (12.4 percent), Britain (11.4 percent), and China (11.3 percent).
Australia's conservative government announced in July, 1996 that general
immigration would be reduced to 74,000 in the current fiscal year that ends
June 30, 1997. </tt><p>
<tt>A Newspoll survey in September 1996 reported that 71 percent of 1,200
voters surveyed believed immigration was "a lot" or "a little" too high.</tt><p>
<tt>Nearly 2,000 Australians marched in Brisbane on November 2 in solidarity
with Asian Australians and to protest the Australian Prime Minister's failure
to deal with the race issue.</tt><p>
<tt>Since September, many Asian tourists, including a group of 160 from
Singapore, have bypassed Australia, hurting the country's billion-dollar
tourism industry.  Nearly two million tourists from Asian countries visit
Australia each year. </tt><p>
<tt>Some 28,670 people emigrated from Australia in the fiscal year ending June
30, 1996.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>Winston Peters, leader of the populist New Zealand First Party,
received 13 percent of the vote in New Zealand's October 12, 1996 election on
an anti-foreigner platform.  New Zealand adopted a German-style voting system
in 1993 and, for the first time, each voter can vote for a party and also for a
local representative.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC29">Slow
Advancement for the Newly-Legalized</a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>The Houston Chronicle ran a series, Out of the Shadows, which concluded
that many of the aliens legalized in 1986-87 are falling into America's
dead-end culture of urban poverty. </tt><p>
<tt>In addition to profiles of unauthorized aliens who received amnesty, the
series includes interviews with Peter Brimelow, who says that "There is no
precedent for a sovereign country undergoing such a rapid and radical
transformation of its ethnic character [brought about by the 1965 amendments to
US immigration law] in the entire history of the world."</tt><p>
<tt>Julian Simon, by contrast, asserted that "On average, when an immigrant
comes into the country, natives are made richer."  Immigrants pay more in taxes
than they receive in government benefits because they are young and likely to
work.</tt><p>
<tt>George Borjas argued that the costs of today's immigration patterns
outweigh the benefits, and that gap between the level of education and skills
of recent immigrants and natives have been widening.</tt><p>
<tt>Michael Fix, co-author of Immigration and Immigrants: Setting the Record
Straight, concluded that immigrants generate a net annual surplus for the US of
$25 billion to $30 billion per year.</tt><p>
<tt>Roy Beck, author of The Case Against Immigration, argues that much of the
increase in US wages between 1925 and 1965 was due to tight labor markets,
which in turn was due to low levels of immigration.</tt><p>

<tt>Borjas, George, and Lynnette Hilton.  1996.  Immigration and the Welfare
State:  Immigrant Participation in Means-Tested Entitlement Programs.  NBER WP
5372.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1990, about nine percent of US households with foreign-born heads
received cash assistance such as AFDC, versus seven percent of households
headed by US-born persons.  However, if in-kind welfare assistance such as
Medicaid and Food Stamps are included, then 21 percent of households with
foreign-born heads received benefits in 1990, versus 14 percent of households
headed by US-born persons.  </tt><p>
<tt>Note that many other analysts of the usage of welfare by immigrants do not
consider the household to be an immigrant household if the head was born in
another country.  One estimate is that two-thirds of immigrant-headed
households include a US-born person.</tt><p>
<tt>Households with foreign-born heads received more assistance--such
households were nine percent of all US households, but they received 14 percent
of the $184 billion spent on federal welfare assistance in 1990.  The gap
between foreign-born and native-born households was greatest for Medicaid--15
percent of the immigrant households, and seven percent of native-born
households, received Medicaid benefits in 1990.</tt><p>
<tt>Hanson, Gordon and Antonio Spilmbergo.  1996.  Illegal Immigration, Border
Enforcement, and Relative Wages. NBER WP 5592.</tt><p>
<tt>This paper concludes that a 10 percent decrease in Mexican real wages was
associated with about eight percent more apprehensions in the following month
between 1976 and 1995.  Adding one more hour of Border Patrol enforcement time
was associated with about 0.3 more apprehensions.</tt><p>
<tt>Hanson, Gordon.  1996.  US-Mexican Integration and Regional Economies:
Evidence from Border-City Pairs. NBER WP 5485.</tt><p>
<tt>This paper investigates the growth of trade and investment in the six
largest US-Mexican border pairs between 1975 and 1989, and concludes that NAFTA
will expand employment and population on both sides of the border.</tt><p>
<tt>Krueger, Alan and Jorn-Steffen Pischke.  1996.  A Statistical Analysis of
Crime Against Foreigners in Unified Germany. NBER WP 5485.</tt><p>
<tt>Using data on the number of crimes committed against foreigners from
newspaper reports, this paper finds that crimes against foreigners are highest
in the former East Germany and that the number of foreigners in a county is
associated with more crimes against foreigners only in the East.</tt><p>
<tt>Borjas, George, Richard Freeman, and Lawrence Katz.  1996.  Searching for
the Effects of Immigration on the Labor Market. NBER WP 5454.</tt><p>
<tt>This paper compares area and factor proportions methods of estimating the
effects of immigrants in local labor markets.  In area analyses, the share of
immigrants in employment, or the change in the share of immigrants, is an
independent variable that is used to try to explain changes in the wages,
unemployment etc of native workers.  As the labor market expands, the estimated
negative effects of immigrants increase in 1980 and 1990 Census data.</tt><p>
<tt>In factor-proportions analyses, by contrast, the analyst assumes that e.g.,
immigrants are unskilled, and natives are skilled, and then estimates the
effects of more immigrants on skilled workers' labor market outcomes.  These
analyses suggest that immigration contributed to falling wages for US workers
with less than a high school education in the 1980s.</tt><p>
<tt>Raphael, Steven and Eugene Smolensky.  1996.  Immigration, Foregone Human
Capital, and the Fisc.  Berkeley:  Graduate School of Public Policy WP 224.
</tt><p>
<tt>If Prop. 187 prohibitions on the estimated 300,000 to 350,000 illegal alien
children in California public schools were implemented, and if the children
stayed in California and were not educated, then the illegal children not
educated would earn from $62,000 to $430,000 less in their lifetimes, with the
largest earnings losses for illegal alien children kept out of kindergarten and
not receiving any education.</tt><p>
<tt>Since more education is associated with higher earnings and more taxes, the
analysis suggests that denying education to persons who remain in California
and seek jobs could be counterproductive.</tt><p>
<tt>Research Perspectives on Migration is a new bi-monthly newsletter produced
by the migration programs of the Carnegie Endowment and the Urban Institute.
The first issue, September/October 1996, deals with the use of welfare by
foreign-born persons in the US and concludes that there is too little consensus
in the social science research to serve as a basis for changing the legal
immigration system in a manner that would attempt to reduce the welfare costs
of immigrants.  For further information, contact David Aronson at
daronson@ceip.org</tt><p>
<tt>The Carnegie Endowment's International Migration Policy Program issued
several brief papers on migration issues in 1996.  The first paper, entitled
Managing Uncertainty, argues that the immigration problem flows from unwanted
immigration, compassion fatigue, and reactions against global interdependence.
The paper concludes that the most important steps needed to deal with
immigration are to have "sound" polices that are reviewed regularly, and to
prevent "anti-immigrant demagogues" from shaping public opinion.</tt><p>
<tt>The "US Refugee Policy" paper reviews resettlement, temporary protection,
asylum, and emergency responses to migration crises.  The paper cautions
against too much reliance on the prevention of refugees, and urges that the US
continue to offer protection to those facing persecution.  The "Converging
Paths to Restriction" paper reviews how governments in France, Italy, and the
UK responded to immigration and asylum issues.  For copies of these reports,

<tt>On the basis of exit polls, the New York Times reported that 83 percent of
those voting in November 1996 were white, 10 percent were African-American,
five percent were Hispanic and one percent were Asian.  About 6.6 million
Hispanics were registered to vote in November 1996, including 2.1 million in
California and 1.6 million in Texas.</tt><p>
<tt>Exit polls after the November 5, 1996 election found that 71 percent of
Hispanic voters supported Clinton, a sharp jump from the Latino vote for
Clinton in 1992 and a sign, some analysts said, that Latinos were voting
against Republicans because of their support for anti-immigration
proposals.</tt><p>
<tt>Republicans are divided over immigration; the party includes both
close-the-border and open-the-border extremes.  The open-border proponents said
"I told you so" when many Hispanic and Asian voters said that they voted for
Clinton because of some Republicans anti-immigrant rhetoric.</tt><p>
<tt>Hispanics are about 26 percent of the California population and they cast
about 1.4 million votes, accounting for 11 to 13 percent of the vote in
California in November 1996, up from 10 percent in 1992, and seven percent in
1988.  There are now 14 Latino representatives in the 80-seat California
Assembly.  The Democrats, who retook control of the Assembly, elected Cruz
Bustamante of Fresno as their first Latino speaker.</tt><p>
<tt>Latinos cast 16 percent of the November 1996 vote in Texas and 12 percent
in Florida, up from 10 and 11 percent in November 1992.</tt><p>
<tt>On November 1, 1996, House Republicans asked the US Attorney General to
appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's Citizenship USA program.  The program was launched in August 1995 to
eliminate the backlog of naturalization applicants.  </tt><p>
<tt>In their letter requesting the special counsel, the five Republican
congressmen said that "The Clinton administration, motivated by the belief that
a large number of new citizens ... (would benefit) the Clinton-Gore ticket in
the upcoming elections, put heavy and continuous pressure on the INS to
naturalize as many new citizens as possible."</tt><p>
<tt>Foreigners wishing to become naturalized US citizens must pay $95 and have
lived in the US for at least five years  (or three, if they are married to a US
citizen), be of good moral character (no felony convictions), be of sound mind
and speak and understand English (unless they are elderly or disabled).  A fee
of $95 is charged.  They must pass a 10- to 12-question test on US history and
civics based on a list of 100 questions and answers provided by the INS, among
them:  "What is the White House?" "Where is the White House located?" and "Name
one right guaranteed by the First Amendment."</tt><p>

<tt>About 1.5 million of the nation's four million adult welfare recipients are
likely to lose welfare benefits in the next few years and an additional 800,000
will lose their food stamps.  Beginning on December 1, 1996, each state will
receive a Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Block Grant--a lump sum
amount that will not change for five years.</tt><p>
<tt>One-third of the aged recipients of Supplemental Security Income are non-US
citizens.  Two-thirds of the non-citizen elderly on SSI are in California, New
York and Florida.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS is likely to be asked to permit a number of state programs to
access its data base to determine the legal status of applicants for state
benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-Texas) in November
asserted that he would oppose Clinton administration efforts to allow non-US
citizens to continue to obtain welfare benefits.  The Ways and Means
Committee's Green Book says that the US spent $4.5 trillion on "means-tested
programs" between 1968 and 1994.</tt><p>
<tt><u>California</u>.  California in November made plans to make illegal
aliens ineligible for benefits funded by state taxes after December 1, 1996,
including prenatal care for pregnant women.  Among the programs whose clients
may be asked about their immigration status are those for early breast-cancer
detection; child-abuse prevention; foster care; abortion and family planning
services; and assistance for the deaf and disabled.</tt><p>
<tt>California will cut welfare payments for 2.7 million recipients on January
1, 1997, by 4.9 percent to $565 for a family of three in urban areas, and by
9.8 percent to $538 for a family of three in 41 rural counties.  Welfare checks
written in December 1996 count against the maximum two years and then work, and
maximum five years of lifetime assistance limits.</tt><p>
<tt>California counties are holding hearings to determine whether to begin
requiring proof of legal US residence before providing services at tax-funded
county clinics.  If the counties turn away illegal aliens, they will have to
get medical services either in hospital emergency rooms or in private "free
clinics."  In Sacramento county, for example, an estimated 630 unauthorized
aliens received medical care at county clinics in 1995, at an estimated cost of
$300,000.  All persons were made eligible for services at county hospitals in
1982.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Texas</u>.  In Texas, leaders of the border county of Zavala believe
that the new welfare law will bring hardship.  Zavala County has the highest
percentage of Texas residents receiving Aid to Families With Dependent
Children, is third in Texas in the proportion of food stamp recipients and
fourth in the percentage of Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries.  The
$281 average weekly wage in the county is half the state average, reflecting
the fact that most residents are seasonal agricultural workers.  More than 90
percent of the students in the Crystal City school district cannot afford 75
cents for lunch. </tt><p>
<tt>Economists see little hope for job creation in the area.  One town resident
observed that even if 10 million jobs were created in the area, 12 million
people would move up from central Mexico to take the jobs. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Massachusetts</u>.  The state estimates that the new welfare law will
eliminate AFDC, Food Stamp and disability benefits for 30,000 legal immigrants.
The state plans to use some of its $80 million windfall under the new welfare
law to create state-funded programs that will assist legal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Poverty</u>.  In 1995, some 36 million US residents, 14 percent of the
population, lived in households with incomes below poverty level.  The poverty
line-- calculated as three times what a family needs to spend to eat-- was
$15,569 for a family of four and $12,158 for a family of three in 1995.
</tt><p>
<tt>The median household income was $34,076 in 1995, meaning that half of the
nation's 100 million households had higher and half had lower incomes.</tt><p>
<tt>For the first time, the Census Bureau released poverty data on native- and
foreign-born residents:  13 percent of the US-born residents were poor,
compared with 28 percent of the foreign-born who were not naturalized US
citizens.  Native-born households had median incomes of $34,800, while
households headed by foreign-born persons had median incomes of $28,400.
</tt><p>
<tt>In 1990, 9.1 percent of US households headed by a foreign-born person and
7.4 percent of households headed by a person born in the US received cash
assistance from a program such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children or
Supplemental Security Income.</tt><p>
<tt>More comprehensive data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation
reveals that the immigrant-native welfare gap widens when non-cash benefits
such as Food Stamps, Medicaid and housing subsidies are included.  Medicaid
accounts for about half of the almost $200 billion spent annually on these
programs.  In 1990-91, about 21 percent of the households headed by immigrants,
compared to 14 percent of households headed by US-born persons, were receiving
a cash or non-cash federal benefit.  </tt><p>
<tt>Almost half of the households headed by persons from the Dominican Republic
and Vietnam received a cash or non-cash federal benefit in an average month in
1990-91.  About one-third or more of the households headed by persons from the
ex-USSR, Mexico and Central America received benefits.  Fewer than 10 percent
of the households headed by persons born in Korea received benefits.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Mexican
Migrants on the Chicken Trail</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt><u>Missouri.</u> The Los Angeles Times on November 10-12, 1996 ran a
three-part report on "the chicken trail," about the recruitment of poultry
workers along the US-Mexican border for employment in the southeast.</tt><p>
<tt>The stories profiled Hudson Foods, based in Noel, Missouri, (population
1,169), which paid a south Texas recruiter, B. Chapman &amp; Co., $175 for each
worker who showed up in Missouri for the $6.70 per hour jobs.  The reporter
told how workers made their way north on the "chicken trail" to work for Hudson
and live in a converted motel, along with 135 other migrant poultry workers,
for $45 per week per person.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, Hudson employed about 1,200 workers to process 1.3 million
chickens each week in Noel.  Annual turnover exceeds 100 percent, so that
Hudson hires about 50 new workers each month.  Hudson employees are represented
by a union.  About 45 percent of the labor force are Latinos.  Hudson paid a
$20,625 INS fine in 1992 because many of them were not authorized to work.
Hudson offers current employees who bring new workers to the plant a $300
bonus.</tt><p>
<tt>Hudson, the country's seventh largest-poultry producer, with headquarters
in Rogers, Arkansas, has 14 facilities in 11 states, more than 10,000 employees
and expects $1.4 billion in sales for 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The reporter-worker described the wet, the 47-degree temperature inside the
plant, the semi-automated "dis-assembly" line and the lack of training for
newly hired workers.  The number of broiler chickens processed in the US each
year has more than doubled, from three billion per year in the early 1970s to
seven billion per year in the mid-1990s.</tt><p>
<tt>Hudson's human resources director was quoted as saying: "there's a large
number of jobs that very few citizens in the US want to do, but they're there
and they need to be done...One of the social goods the poultry industry
provides is employing people who would otherwise have a great deal of trouble
getting employed."</tt><p>
<tt>The labor recruiting company travels to industry shows in search of
employers seeking unskilled labor and then offers to recruit workers for theses
companies.  According to the reporter, the recruiting company checked workers'
identification cards and took urine samples on the particular trip reported.
The Border Patrol checked the Greyhound passengers identification cards in
Falfurrias, about 75 miles north of the Mexican border.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, The motel owner bought the run-down hunting lodge motel for
$220,000 and reopened it to house migrant chicken workers.  Because poultry
work is considered nonfarm work, it is not subject to special farm worker
housing inspection, only normal local health and safety screening.  The motel
management takes every new Hudson worker to apply for food stamps at the
Division of Family Services and the number of Latinos receiving food stamps in
Noel increased from 35 per month in 1993 to 375 per month in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Hudson is the economic linchpin of Noel, Missouri, but Hudson pays no
property taxes to the city.  The number of Latino students in Noel's elementary
school rose from 25 to more than 100.  Hudson and nearby Simmons Foods
contributed $12,000 to Noel schools in 1996. </tt><p>
<tt>The final article in the series concluded that, across rural and small town
America, jobs that "used to offer working-class security to a local population"
are now filled by Latino immigrants.  The article concluded that towns without
traffic lights and ATMs are not well equipped to deal with bilingual education,
overcrowded housing, and racial tensions.</tt><p>
<tt>There are weekly reports of INS raids on food processing facilities or of
unauthorized aliens detected by local police.  For example, on November 21,
1996, 10 unauthorized workers were apprehended at the Hi-Point Beef Co., a
meat processing plant in Bellefontaine, Ohio.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 40 unauthorized aliens were apprehended in late October in Idaho
Falls, Idaho, the tenth INS raid in the area in 1996, prompting criticism that
the INS detained and removed the parents of children in school from the US
before they had time to tell their children.  Most of the inspections were of
potato processing and similar facilities.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Tobacco</u>. The Virginia Agricultural Growers Association imported
2,603 Mexican workers to harvest tobacco under the H-2A program.  The H-2A
program requires that US employers offer to US workers, and pay to foreign
workers, an Adverse Effect Wage Rate of $5.80 per hour in 1996 in Virginia.
The H-2A program also requires US farm employers to provide free housing to
workers and to pay the workers' round trip transportation.  Farmers have to
guarantee workers employment for at least 75 percent of a 44-hour work week, or
33 hours.  H-2A tobacco workers in Virginia earn about $3,000 a summer, and
$5,500 if they stay for six months.  </tt><p>
<tt>H-2A tobacco workers are recruited in Mexico by Del-Al Associates of San
Antonio, Texas.  The Mexicans obtain visas to enter the US at the American
consulate in Monterrey.  Mexican H-2A tobacco workers pay $30 to the local
recruiter who found them, and  $125 to Del-Al Associates, which includes $44
for the US visa and an $81 recruitment fee.  There is reportedly a blacklist
that can get Mexican workers excluded from participation in the H-2A program.
</tt><p>
<tt>Mexican workers are also recruited under the nonfarm H-2B program to work
in the Virginia and North Carolina crab meat industry.  In 1996, eight Virginia
crabmeat processors hired 143 Mexicans under the H-2B program and 27 North
Carolina seafood houses got Department of Labor approval to hire 1,685 H-2B
Mexican workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the seafood processors said that, when their local Black women
employees retired, they could not "compete against the welfare programs of the
United States government" for local workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Unlike farm workers hired under the H-2A program, H-2B workers do not
receive written contracts that guarantee them a certain amount of work at a
government set wage.  Most H-2B crab workers are paid piece rate wages of $1.35
to $1.89 per pound and most workers can extract 18 to 40 pounds of crabmeat per
day, for daily earnings of  $25 to $67.  Seafood processors sell crab meat for
$6 to $13 per pound.</tt><p>
<tt>All workers must earn at least the federal minimum wage, $4.75 per hour,
which generally means that workers must clean at least 750 crabs over eight
hours to obtain 25 pounds of crab meat.  Workers are entitled to 1.5 times
their base wages for hours in excess of 40 weekly, a requirement that employers
often violate.</tt><p>
<tt>Most seafood processors provide housing for workers, at a cost of $15 to
$25 per week for beds in mobile homes or converted motels,  The workers pay
about $100 for bus tickets from Mexico to Virginia or North Carolina.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers are reportedly seeking jobs in construction, on tobacco
farms  and in meat and poultry plants in Kentucky.  In October, 1996, the INS
won its first conviction of an employer in Kentucky, the Valley Fresh chicken-
processing plant in Glasgow, for knowingly hiring illegal alien workers.  Wages
were $5 hourly.  </tt><p>
<tt>In September, 1996, Kentucky police stopped a rented truck taking 31
illegal aliens to North Carolina, but the short-staffed INS told the police to
let the truck continue its journey.</tt><p>

<tt>Legal immigration is expected to return as a major issue in the 105th
Congress, which begins its work in January 1997.  Current law anticipates the
admission of 675,000 immigrants each year within numerically limited
categories. Although about 900,000 legal immigrants in all categories were
admitted in FY96, plus an additional 100,000 asylum seekers and parolees.  An
estimated 200,000 US citizens and immigrants emigrate every year.</tt><p>
<tt>The extremes in the new Congress are marked by proponents of the status
quo, and those who advocate a moratorium that would halt all legal immigration
except for the immediate families of US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>The bipartisan US Commission on Immigration Reform, established by the 1990
Immigration Act, will issue its final recommendations in September 1997.  The
CIR in June 1995 recommended that the basic legal immigration system remain in
place, but that the entry of nuclear families be speeded up by awarding the
immigration slots now available to the adult brothers and sisters of US
citizens to immediate relatives. </tt><p>
<tt>The CIR also recommended that the number of slots for immigrants requested
by US employers be reduced and that US employers demonstrate that they looked
for US workers by paying a fee into a fund that would be used to train
Americans who could eventually fill the jobs now done by foreigners. </tt><p>
<tt>The President endorsed the CIR's recommendation for a lowering of the
overall number of legal immigrants allowed to enter the country annually, but
negated that endorsement in March 1996, when his administration backed efforts
to separate legal and illegal immigration proposals in Congress.  The death of
the Chairman of the Commission, former Rep. Barbara Jordan (D-Texas), in
January 1996, is widely seen as a factor in the Clinton administration's change
of heart.</tt><p>
<tt>The three major doors through which legal immigrants enter the US
are:</tt><p>
<tt><u>Family Unification</u>.  Congressional critics of the current law assert
that chain migration rather than US needs is increasing the number of
immigrants admitted to the US for family reasons.  The US admits without limit
spouses and minor children of US citizens, so that the current naturalization
wave is expected to increase immediate family immigration.  </tt><p>
<tt>After immediate families of US citizens, the US has four family immigration
preferences:  the parents of US citizens, the immediate families of US
immigrants and the adult brothers and sisters of US citizens. </tt><p>
<tt>There are lengthy backlogs in these categories.  The CIR recommended a
trade off, more slots to speed up the unification of immediate families of
legal immigrants and the elimination of slots for brothers and sisters.</tt><p>
<tt>In an effort to head off a debate over reducing legal immigration, Empower
America in November 1996 released, "In Defense of a Nation: The Military
Contributions of Immigrants," a report that argues that immigration increases
national security by adding to the US population, by adding scientists who
develop military technology and through individual acts of heroism by newcomers
in the armed forces.  The report was released at a press conference attended by
a Mexican immigrant who won a silver star fighting in Vietnam.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Employment</u>.  The major bill in the House in 1996 would have reduced
the number of immigrants admitted annually for economic/employment reasons from
140,000 annually to 135,000(including dependents), while the Senate bill would
have reduced the number to 90,000.  Both bills would have reformed the H-1B
program, which admits a maximum 65,000 professional temporary foreign workers
each year, each for up to six years.</tt><p>
<tt>Business groups, especially high-tech companies such as Microsoft, opposed
any changes to the economic/employment-based immigration system.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Refugees</u>. The US adopted the UN definition of a refugee in 1980:  a
refugee is a person outside her country of citizenship with a well-founded fear
of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a
particular social group, or political opinion.  The 1980 act anticipated the
normal arrival of 50,000 refugees each year and pledged the federal government
to reimburse states for the welfare and other costs associated with resettling
refugees.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Non-Immigrants</u>.  Some 22 million foreigners enter the US every year,
most for short-term tourist or business visits.  However, about 650,000 are
admitted each year for US jobs or to study in the US.  Many of these
non-immigrants are authorized to remain in the US for three to 10 years and
many find ways to become permanent residents.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Population Impacts</u>.  About one-third of US population growth is due
to immigration and, if the US-born and US-citizen children of recent immigrants
are included, immigration accounts for more than half of US population growth,
according to the Census Bureau.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration is increasing the size of the current and future population.
In 1989, the Census Bureau projected that the US population, 265 million in
1996, would level off at 300 million in 2050.  The most recent projections
suggest that the US population will be 400 million in 2050.  About 93 percent
of the population growth in the year 2050 will result from immigration that has
occurred since 1991.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, there were more Hispanic than Black babies born in the US--17
percent of the 3.9 million babies born were Hispanic, compared to 16 percent
Black, five percent Asian and 62 percent non-Hispanic white.  Hispanics are
expected to surpass Blacks as the largest US minority population in
2005.</tt><p>

<tt>The INS announced that it removed from the US 67,100 illegal aliens in
FY96, and 160,000 over the past three years.  About 55 percent of the aliens
removed committed crimes in the US and many are removed as they leave US
prisons.  About 75 percent of those removed in FY96 were Mexicans.</tt><p>
<tt>In FY96, the INS conducted 4,900 worksite operations that resulted in the
removal of 14,000 unauthorized workers.  In a first-ever agreement, the INS in
October 1996 announced that it would notify the Virginia Department of Social
Services when it removed unauthorized workers from jobs in that state.</tt><p>
<tt>On November 13, 1996, the US Supreme Court ruled that the INS could
consider the fraud an alien committed in entering the country when deciding
whether the person should be deported.  The ruling overturned the opinion of an
appeals court that said that, because the INS generally disregards fraudulent
acts committed by people trying to gain entry, INS must exclude from
consideration any fraudulent acts connected to how one ultimately got into the
United States.</tt><p>
<tt>The case involved a couple from China who moved to Taiwan, and divorced
there.  The wife, using fraudulent documents, then assumed the identity of a US
citizen.  The couple remarried in Taiwan under false names and the man used his
wife's apparent US citizenship to immigrate.  The wife, meanwhile, divorced her
husband under her true name to obtain a US immigration visa through US resident
relatives.</tt><p>
<tt>In late November, the INS issued an arrest warrant for Governor Wilson's
ex-maid; the maid's questionable legal status was detected in 1995, during
Wilson's brief campaign for the Republican nomination for President.  The INS
suspects that the maid may have fraudulently married a US citizen to become a
legal immigrant.</tt><p>
<tt>On the US-Mexican border, environmental and public officials expressed more
concern about unauthorized migrants threatening fragile plants in the Otay
Mountains in eastern San Diego county.  There have been more than 322 fires so
far in 1996 in the Otay Mountains.  The rugged terrain means that mostly young
men attempt the trip.</tt><p>
<tt>INS Commissioner Doris Meissner, in an October 27, 1996 interview with the
New York Times magazine, said that Congress was right in maintaining the
distinction between legal and illegal immigration in 1996 legislation.
However, she faulted Congress with not doing enough to help the INS enforce
employer sanctions.</tt><p>
<tt>Meissner noted that denying welfare benefits to legal immigrants
represented a major change in the US social contract and disputed the notion
that illegal alien women are increasing numbers are motivated enter the US to
give birth to US citizen babies.  She noted that US citizen children cannot
sponsor their parents for immigration until they are 21.</tt><p>

<tt>Gaps between the rich and poor in Mexico and between the industrial
northern and indigenous southern parts of the country, are widening.  There
have been many skirmishes in Mexico's so-called misery belt--Chiapas, Oaxaca
and Guerrero.  One-fourth of the population is illiterate, compared with six
percent along the northern border.</tt><p>
<tt>On November 9, 1996 police shot and killed three protesting Mexican
peasants in Chiapas.  The peasants were demanding a doubling in the base price
for corn, from the government-guaranteed price of about $160 per ton to $315 a
ton.</tt><p>
<tt>One recent study 55 percent of all Mexicans are poor and working class, 35
percent are middle class, and 10 percent are upper class.  Only one-third of
the poor and working class have jobs that bring in regular wages and salaries.
Mexico's informal or non-tax paying sector represents about 39 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP).</tt><p>
<tt>Two-thirds of the 14 million people that Mexico classifies as "living in
extreme poverty" are in rural areas. Mexican President Zedillo on November 8,
1996 said that the average adult Mexican has seven years of education, up from
one year of schooling in 1950.</tt><p>
<tt>Many US investors are reportedly postponing plans to invest in Mexico
because of concerns about kidnappings and the persistence of bureaucratic
problems.</tt><p>
<tt>Zedillo announced the government's 1997 budget on November 7, 1996.  It
projects a 1997 GDP of about $360 billion, four percent growth and 15 percent
inflation.  The peso/dollar exchange rate is expected to fall from the current
7.7 pesos to $1 to about 8.5 to $1.  Exports of about $100 billion are expected
to approach 25 percent of GDP.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's economy grew by 7.4 percent in the third quarter of 1996, up from
7.2 percent in the second quarter.  The US has been importing about $6 billion
worth of goods from Mexico each month in 1996 and exporting goods worth $4.5
billion, producing a $1.5 billion monthly US trade deficit with Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico and other Latin American countries continue to try to increase their
savings from the current 20 percent of GDP to the 30 percent more common in
East Asia.  </tt><p>
<tt>In October 1996, unemployment fell to 5.2 percent in 41 cities, the lowest
level since January 1995.  Unemployment peaked at 7.6 percent in August 1995.
Mexico considers persons 12 and older who actively sought a job in the two
months before the survey to be in the labor force.</tt><p>
<tt>In voting in November, opposition parties won enough mayorships to control
10 of the 12 largest Mexican cities.  In response, the PRI-dominated 500-member
Chamber of Deputies backtracked on election reforms that were meant to open up
the political process.  Over the protest of opposition parties, the Chamber
approved plans to spend $250 million in government funds in the July 6, 1997
congressional races, about half of which will go to PRI candidates.  </tt><p>
<tt>PRI has governed Mexico for 67 years -- the longest uninterrupted reign of
any governing party in the world.</tt><p>
<tt>Some experts wonder what the impact will be when Mexicans living in the US
have their first opportunity to vote in Mexico's next election.  If, as
expected, the PAN manages to edge the PRI in Mexico, a poor showing among
Mexican voters living in the United States would critically diminish the PAN's
share of the total presidential tally.  In the close election everyone is
expecting, a large unfavorable vote from the US could reinstall the PRI through
2006.</tt><p>
<tt>The estimated four to five million Mexican voters living in the US are a
huge unknown in the election and each party has a different approach to
reaching these voters.  The PRI was responsible for giving Mexicans living in
the US the right to vote, hoping to win their support.  The PAN has no strategy
for the voters north of the border.  The PRD has extensive networks of voters
through the US and pushed for emigrant voting rights. </tt><p>
<tt>Mexico plans to "register" Guatemalan refugees in Campeche, Quitana Roo and
Chiapas in December 1996, so that a "legalization process for certain migrants"
can be carried out.</tt><p>
<tt>In Guatemala, it was announced that a 36-year civil war would end with a
peace treaty to be signed in Guatemala City on December 29, 1996.  During
Central America's last and longest civil war, some 100,000 people died, and an
estimated 40,000 disappeared.</tt><p>
<tt>A Bank of Boston survey released in November found that 57 percent of US
residents do not want NAFTA to be extended to other Latin American countries,
in part because 51 percent believe that free trade agreements cost the US
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>During his first term, President Clinton did not visit Latin America except
for a quick trip to Haiti to visit American troops.  Many Latin American
diplomats say the US largely ignores Latin America and has no clear policy
toward the region, except for trying to suppress narcotics.  The Clinton
administration says it does plan a presidential visit to Latin America next
year, although no firm date has been set. </tt><p>
<tt>Other Latin American specialists take a more favorable point of view,
pointing out that the Clinton administration acted decisively in response to
the Mexican peso crisis of 1994.  The multibillion-dollar bailout was a
landmark in US-Latin American relations. </tt><p>
<tt>Trade is expected to be the top issue in US-Latin American relations during
Clinton's second term.  A Free Trade Area of the Americans, agreed to at the
1994 Miami summit, should be established by 20005.  </tt><p>

<tt>Largely because of changes in immigration laws in 1965, the United States
"is now the most religiously diverse country on earth," according to an article
in the September-October, 1996 issue of Harvard magazine.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to Professor Martin Marty of the University of Chicago, a
religion has "six marks"--a system centered on a matter of deep meaning,
socialization (believers tend to form communities), show a preference for
symbolic language over everyday speech, use ceremonies (especially at birth,
marriage and death), take a metaphysical view of life (there is more to the
world than what one sees) and require behavioral adjustments (attending Sunday
School or shunning pork).</tt><p>
<tt>Some social scientists consider that religious institutions to be of the
most important sources of social capital in the US--institutions that can
create the social networks and norms that enable people to work together for
common goals.  Churches, in this view, teach people basic political skills--
how to give a speech, organize a meeting, raise money and provide pools of
friends and neighbors who can be recruited for civic activities.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Protestants</u>.  Many traditional Protestant denominations are
welcoming immigrants and hope to thereby bolster declining membership.</tt><p>
<tt>It has not always been easy to integrate immigrants.  The First United
Methodist Church in Queens, New York was troubled in 1995 by divisions between
Filipino immigrants and African Americans.  The pastor of the church tried to
bring in new lay ministers, but was removed by the Bishop, prompting some of
the immigrant members to picket the Bishop's office.  In Queens, churches that
rely on immigrants who joined long ago are dying--one has 30 elderly
Polish-American members, another only five German-American members.</tt><p>
<tt>The United Methodist Church has lost about two million members nationwide
in 10 years.  Membership is growing in communities with Korean, Caribbean,
African and Asian immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Most Americans attend neighborhood churches and their attendance patterns
reflect housing patterns.  Martin Luther King in the 1960s asserted that 11 am
on Sunday morning was the most segregated hour of the week, as
African-Americans and whites went to separate churches.  There are very few
racially-integrated churches in the US.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Catholics</u>.  The Pope's October 1995 visit to New York highlighted
the ethnic diversity of Catholic parishes brought about by continuing
immigration.  Churches built by German or Irish or Italian immigrants decades
ago now celebrate Mass in Spanish or Polish.  Mass is celebrated in New York
area churches in 38 languages.</tt><p>
<tt>Before his 1995 visit, the Pope released a statement asking established
residents to try to understand the circumstances of illegal immigrants.  "The
illegal immigrant," the Pope said, "comes before us like that stranger whom
Jesus asks to be recognized."  The Pope called for international cooperation to
foster political stability and accelerate economic development so that people
are not forced to migrate.</tt><p>
<tt>In an address to the United Nations in 1995 the Pope deplored the "fear of
difference" that he said can lead to violations of human rights.</tt><p>
<tt>Catholic leaders make a point of saying that no passport or papers are
required to enter their churches, thus reproving those with less welcoming
attitudes to immigrants.  Los Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahoney decried Prop.
187 in California in Fall 1994 as a "social sin," and pastoral letters in New
York and elsewhere remind listeners that Catholic teaching instructs that
immigrants should be treated with hospitality.</tt><p>
<tt>A nationwide September 1995 poll conducted in English and Spanish found
that about the same percentage of Catholics as respondents in general--28
percent--want immigration levels reduced.</tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 22 million Hispanic Catholics in the United States,
about a third of the country's 66 million Catholics.  About a fourth of the
Hispanic Catholics were born outside the US.</tt><p>
<tt>California's Catholic priests are becoming more outspoken on issues such as
affirmative action and prenatal care for undocumented immigrants, a major
change from their previous behind-the-scenes lobbying efforts.  A group of
clerics representing the state's 12 dioceses met with elected officials in
Sacramento in March, 1996. </tt><p>
<tt>According to a spokesperson, the group's advocacy is a mandate from the
state's 5.6 million Hispanic Catholics whom they represent, and also reflects
the church's traditional concern for the poor, elderly and children.  The group
became more outspoken after a November 1995 pastoral statement from the US
Catholic Conference of Bishops that urged Catholics to become more active
politically as a community conscience. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Islam.</u>  There are six to eight million Muslims in the US, including
two million Black Muslims.  The number of Muslims in the US is increasing
rapidly through immigration and conversions.  Islam, now with one billion
adherents, is the world's fastest-growing religion.   </tt><p>
<tt>Of the more than 1,200 mosques in the US, nearly 80 percent have been built
within the past 12 years.  The first theological school in the US to train
Islamic imams opened in Virginia in 1996.  In the past two years, six mosques
have been damaged or destroyed by arson.</tt><p>
<tt>Experts say that Islam, with its clearly defined behavioral norms, is
particularly appealing to American blacks living in neighborhoods where
community and family life have been strained by poverty, crime and despair.
Islam also provides an alternative for some blacks who associate Christianity
with slavery and racism. For some, Islam is a bridge to their African roots--
as many as 20 percent of the slaves transported to America may have been
Muslims.</tt><p>
<tt>At a private Islamic school in Silver Spring, Maryland, girls who wear the
hijab, or traditional Muslim head scarf, do not have to worry about teasing by
their classmates.  Islamic schools in the Washington, DC area are popular; most
have long waiting lists.  The American Muslim Council estimates that there are
200,000 Muslims in the Washington DC area and 1,500 pupils in Islamic schools.
Many Muslim parents who cannot get their children into Islamic school opt to
homeschool.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Muslims, both immigrant and American-born, are organizing to increase
their political clout.  Most are liberal on minority rights and immigration,
but conservative in such matters as opposing sex and violence in movies and
television.  In California, home to the largest Muslim community in the US,
most Muslims supported Republican Pete Wilson in the governor's race, but most
opposed Prop. 187. </tt><p>

<tt>A survey found that 52 percent of graduating US high school students think
the US has too many immigrants.  More than half believe that immigration and
affirmative action will make it harder for them to get into the best
universities and to find good jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>The Wall Street Journal on November 13, 1996 reported that more employees
who are bilingual are demanding and getting additional wages.  The prevailing
stated policy of US employers has been to set wages by the job, not according
to the qualifications of the person filling the job, so most US employers have
not paid premium wages for workers with bilingual skills.  Management jobs, on
the other hand, often offer wage premiums for bilingual skills.</tt><p>
<tt>Bilingual skills used on the job have brought wage premiums of five to 10
percent to US Customs inspectors and MCI operators.  In some cases, wage
premiums for bilingual employees have led to grievances from non-bilingual
employees.</tt><p>
<tt>In New York City, a new magazine, City Family, is aimed at low- and
middle-income immigrants trying to make a better life for themselves.  About
210,000 copies are sold each month, half in Spanish as the La Familia de la
Ciudad.  The magazine, aimed at women, is written at a fifth-grade level.  The
magazine is distributed free in places where immigrants congregate as well as
by subscription.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Affirmative Action</u>.  California voters, 54 to 46 percent, approved
Proposition 209 in November 1996, an initiative that eliminates quotas and
preferences in state and local government university admissions, contracting
and hiring. Proposition 209 amends the California Constitution to read, "The
state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any
individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national
origin in the operation of public employment, public education or public
contracting."</tt><p>
<tt>Governor Wilson immediately issued an executive order directing state
agencies to identify programs that grant or encourage preferences based on race
or sex.</tt><p>
<tt>Men voted two to one for Prop. 209, as did 60 percent of white women.
About one-third of Black and Hispanic voters supported Prop. 209.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Hmong</u>.  There are about 60,000 Hmong refugees from Southeast Asia in
California's San Joaquin Valley cities of Fresno, Merced and Tulare.  About 70
percent are on public assistance, the highest rate of any immigrant group.  The
Hmong are considered to be most disadvantaged refugee group ever to come to
America.  Many are not literate and most live in ethnic enclaves.  Some of
their customs clash with the mores of established residents, including having
girls marry at 13 and many women having nine or 10 children. </tt><p>
<tt>Hmong community leaders say that in 1996 about 6,000 Hmong have left the
San Joaquin Valley for Minnesota, Wisconsin, Oregon and elsewhere.  They
attribute the departures to the prospect of losing welfare benefits and to
better job prospects elsewhere.  Many have moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, which
has 32,000 Hmong residents.</tt><p>
<tt>In the 1960s, the Hmong were recruited by the CIA to fight the Viet Cong
and suffered the highest casualty rates of any group of combatants in the
Vietnam War.  To many of the 125,000 Hmong who made their way to the US,
welfare benefits are no more than a proper reward for having fought in an
American cause.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>The German Bundestag in November approved changes to immigration laws that
permit the expulsion of foreigners convicted of "severe" disruption of the
peace at an unauthorized protest rally.  The law was a response to Kurdish
protests in Spring 1996 against the Turkish government.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany continues to debate eased naturalization procedures.  Persons who
have a right (Anspruch) to German nationality do not have to take a language
test, while those who are permitted (Ermessen) to apply for naturalization must
satisfy residence, language and other requirements.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most of the proposals would ease the requirements for the
Ermessenseinbuergerung, such as reducing the residence requirement for persons
born in Germany, or giving persons born in Germany the right to become German
nationals at age 16 or 18.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Bosnians/Serbs. </u> Germany and Bosnia-Herzegovina in November signed a
final agreement to return home the 320,000 Bosnians in Germany.  Until June
1997, only single people and couples without children will return.</tt><p>
<tt>German courts in August ruled that Bosnians "tolerated" in Germany do not
have the right to apply for asylum in Germany because the Bosnian government
can protect them within the borders of Bosnia.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany and Yugoslavia signed an agreement October 10, 1996 to begin return
135,000 mostly Kosovo-Albanians on December 1, 1996.  The return of the persons
to Serbia is expected to take three years.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Asylum</u>.  On November 5, 1996, a minister charged with providing
"church asylum" to a Roma gypsy between 1994 and 1996 went on trial, the first
time a person involved in church asylum was put on trial in Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of asylum seekers in October was 11, 677.</tt><p>
<tt>In the first seven months of 1996, 489 rejected asylum seekers appealed to
the German Constitutional Court and eight were found to have been
unconstitutionally rejected.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Aussiedler</u>.  Germany accepts up to 220,000 ethnic Germans per year
from the ex-USSR.  The SPD has been urging the coalition government to make
this annual quota flexible, reducing the number admitted when German
unemployment and funds to provide integration assistance decline.  The German
government reduced integration assistance for Aussiedler, but kept the quota at
220,000 per year.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany requires ethnic Germans to complete their applications and to
demonstrate some knowledge of German, before they leave Kazackstan and Russia
for Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 3.5 million Aussiedler migrated to Germany since 1950, including 1.3
million from the ex-USSR, 420,000 from Romania, and 104,000 from the
ex-Czechoslovakia.  The peak year of Aussiedler migration was 1990, when
397,999 persons arrived.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Vietnamese</u>.  On November 1, Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, the German
government official with responsibility for foreigners, called for a permanent
right of abode for Vietnamese workers in the former East Germany.  Following
reunification, East Germany's foreign worker population dropped from 90,000
Angolans, Cubans, Hungarians, Mozambicans and Vietnamese to 15,000, including
13,000 Vietnamese. </tt><p>
<tt>Most of the former East German guest workers received an
Aufenthaltsbefugnis in 1993-94, a residence permit that can be renewed every
two years if the foreigner can prove that he has appropriate housing and no
receipt of welfare or record of crime.  After four renewals or eight years of
lawful residence, the Vietnamese are eligible for an Aufenthaltserlaubnis, a
more secure residence permit.</tt><p>
<tt>Under current law, residence before 1993-94 does not count for the
Vietnamese seeking to qualify for an Aufenthaltserlaubnis.  One proposal is to
count half of the years before 1993 toward the eight-year requirement and to
permit those convicted of minor crimes to obtain residence permits.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of xenophobic violent crimes against foreigners living in
Germany fell from 382 in the first eight months of 1995 to 200 in the same
period in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Illegal Immigration</u>.  At the end of August, 1996, the<u> </u>German
Border Patrol announced that it had apprehended 29,604 illegal aliens
attempting to enter Germany over its eastern borders in 1995, down about five
percent from 1995.  Those apprehended represented an estimated 80 percent of
illegal entrants.</tt><p>
<tt>An additional 125,742 foreigners were turned back at the border and 36,455
were flown out of Germany by the German Border Patrol.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Labor Market</u>.  Unemployment in October rose to over four million or
10.6 percent of the labor force.</tt><p>
<tt>About three million foreigners were employed in Germany in April 1995.
About 37 percent were employed in manufacturing, 22 percent in services such as
hotels and restaurants, 15 percent in other services, 11 percent in
construction and eight percent were self employed.</tt><p>
<tt>Schwarzarbeit--unauthorized foreigners and Germans working for unreported
wages--cost Germany an estimated DM100 million or $65 million per year in lost
income and payroll taxes.  There are an estimated 500,000 "illegal jobs" in
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>German employers and construction unions in November 1996 agreed on a
minimum wage for all construction workers for the period January-August, 1997.
All workers on construction sites must be paid at least DM17 ($11.33) per hour
in the former west Germany and DM15.64 ($10.43) per hour in the east, which
would then become the minimum wage for foreign workers.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>An estimated 200,000 foreign workers and 350,000 German workers are
employed at German building sites.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, a total DM117 billion ($76 billion) was spent on unemployment
insurance, early retirement benefits and other programs for the jobless in
Germany.  An average 3.6 million people were unemployed in 1995, about 10
percent of the labor force.  </tt><p>
<tt>A report by the Council of Economic Advisors found that growth in east
Germany will be only 2.25 percent in 1997, which means that for the first time
since German reunification in 1990, the growth rate in the east will be slower
than in western Germany.  Construction has been the catalyst for east German
growth.  Productivity in east Germany remains 50 percent below that in the
west, but wages in the east are about 70 percent of western levels.</tt><p>
<tt>The German union confederation, the DGB, in November 1996 changed the
manifesto adopted in 1958 to accept more labor market flexibility.  The change
was pushed by IG Metall, the world's largest industrial union, with about three
million members, or one-third of DGB members.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Human rights</u>.  On November 8, a UN human rights committee criticized
the treatment of foreigners and minorities by German police and expressed
concern about continuing xenophobia and anti-Semitism in Germany.  The UN
committee recommended the establishment of independent bodies throughout
Germany to investigate complaints of ill treatment by the police.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Turks.</u>  Turkish President Suleyman Demirel visited Germany on
November 6 for talks with German officials regarding Turkey's bid for EU
membership, human rights and the security of Turks living in Germany.  Demirel
said that Turkish EU membership is only a question of time.  German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel responded that Turkey belongs to Europe and serves as a
bridge between Europe, Islam and Central Asia, but added that Turkey must
improve its human rights record. </tt><p>

Amends 1993 Immigration
Law</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The French cabinet on November 6, 1996 approved a bill that would remove
"anomalies" created by 1993 immigration laws, largely by increasing the power
of police to deal with illegal immigrants and make it easier for foreigners
with a French spouse or French children to obtain residence permits.</tt><p>
<tt>The bill would permit aliens who did not leave France as instructed to be
jailed for up to three months and permit police to conduct identity checks in
workplaces to crack down on illegal labor.</tt><p>
<tt>France's Human Rights Commission asked the French government on November 15
to review the entire 1993 immigration law because it violates human dignity
without resolving the problems of illegal immigration and labor.  The
commission said that the bill to remove the anomalies would clear up the status
of a number of immigrants but may threaten individual freedom and create a
special criminal law for foreigners which the commission believes would breach
the principle of equal justice. </tt><p>
<tt>In Dreux, a city of 36,000 45 miles west of Paris whose population is 20
percent immigrant, a mayoral contest highlighted the tensions between the
French and North African immigrants.  The National Front candidate said that
illegal immigrant children should not be permitted in French schools.</tt><p>
<tt>The National Front candidate, who promised to double the city's police
force to 40, won 36 percent of the vote in the first round. The National Front
Candidate lost in the run-off election on November 24 despite a visit to the
town by National Frond leader Jean-Marie Le Pen.  The incumbent may won 60.4
percent while the National Front candidate trailed with 36.4 percent.  National
Front mayors were elected in Toulon, Orange and Marignane.  </tt><p>
<tt>After the election, fighting between the conservative and National Front
supporters was reported. No one was seriously injured.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many of the North Africans live in high rises on the outskirts of the city
where unemployment and reliance on welfare are high.</tt><p>
<tt>The Economist in its November 16 issue summarized the French integration
model as one which expects newcomers to "speak French, eat French food, wear
French clothes, observe French customs." </tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, Jean-Claude Barreau, the adviser on immigration to the French
minister of the interior, was quoted as saying that "when somebody emigrates,
he changes not only his country, but also his history.  Foreigners arriving [to
settle] in France must understand that from henceforth their ancestors are the
Gauls and that they have a new homeland . . . But Muslim extremists have begun
arriving in France as colonizers, with gods and weapons in their baggage . . .
Today, there is a real Islamic threat in France which is part of a great
worldwide wave of Muslim fundamentalism."</tt><p>
<tt>France has four to five million Muslim residents.  About half are French
citizens, born in France or acquiring French nationality (by marriage or
naturalization) since their arrival. About six percent of the Muslims adhere to
the strict tenets of their faith and 10-15 percent worship regularly at a
mosque or prayer center, about the same percent of French Catholics who go
regularly to mass.</tt><p>
<tt>A 1996 poll found that two-thirds of the French think that France has "too
many Arabs" and "too many Muslims.".</tt><p>
<tt>High school students in the French Guiana capital Cayenne in South America
rioted in November; the French attributed the riots to illegal immigration,
which helped to increase the population to 140,000 from 80,000 over the past 13
years.  The unemployment rate is 25 percent.</tt><p>

<tt>An International Organization for Migration heard a plea to treat
prostitutes as migrant workers because they are forced by their economic
situation to cross borders to work as prostitutes.  Hungarian police estimate
that one-third of the prostitutes working in clubs, massage parlors and other
venues in Budapest are foreigners, primarily from countries east of
Hungary.</tt><p>
<tt>The City Council of Verona, Italy is attempting to halt a rise in
prostitution primarily by foreign women from Africa, Romania and Albania.  The
council suggested confining prostitution to a designated area of the city and a
reopening of brothels--much to the outrage of the Catholic Church.</tt><p>
<tt>The women are recruited with promises of high wage jobs but, after their
arrival, the smugglers destroy their documents and force them into
prostitution.  Italy's largest association of prostitutes charges that, since
the Italian authorities cannot control the influx of illegal immigrants, they
target the most visible immigrants--prostitutes.  </tt><p>
<tt>By the end of October, 1996, 12 persons were arrested in Belgium under a
1995 law that prohibits "trade in human beings."  Over the past four years, a
Belgian-based smuggling ring recruited an estimated 4,000 Filipinos by
promising them high wage jobs in Europe.  They then sent most of the Filipinos
to Italy as manual workers, maids or prostitutes.</tt><p>
<tt>The Filipinos paid up to $8,000 each to the smugglers.</tt><p>
<tt>The Belgian law allows anyone who forces an immigrant to work against
his/her will to be charged with illegally trafficking in human labor.  Without
the new rule, any abused immigrant trying to get police protection would have
been immediately deported as an illegal alien before being able to testify at a
trial.</tt><p>

Immigrants</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Ireland, a country of 3.6 million with a per capita GNP of $13,500 in 1994,
has heretofore been a country of emigration rather than a destination for
immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Today Ireland has about 40,000 legal alien residents, including 2,000
asylum seekers who are awaiting decisions on whether they will be allowed to
remain in Ireland.  Most of the legal aliens have annually renewable
visas.</tt><p>
<tt>Legal aliens who have been married to an Irish citizen for three years are
automatically entitled to Irish citizenship.  Those not married to an Irish
citizen can apply to the Minister for Justice for Irish citizenship after five
years' legal residence in Ireland, although the Justice ministry does not have
to give any reason for refusing citizenship.</tt><p>
<tt>During the first nine months of 1996, 713 foreigners applied for asylum in
Ireland, versus 424 in 1995, 355 in 1994, 91 in 1993 and 39 in 1992.  The
largest group of asylum seekers are Romanians, followed by persons from Somalia
and Algeria.  In 1995, 14 foreigners were granted refugee status and eight were
given "humanitarian leave to remain" in Ireland.</tt><p>
<tt>At present, the authoritative statement of Ireland's refugee policy is a
1985 letter from the Irish Department of Justice to the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) outlining its commitment to the 1951 Geneva
Convention.  The practice has been to interview applicants for asylum and then
to await comments from the London office of UNHCR and the Irish Department of
Foreign Affairs.  Only after their advice was received was a final decision
reached, often after two to three years.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Irish authorities, these delays and some passengers on
Aeroflot planes seeking asylum during stopovers at Shannon Airport, contributed
to the 1,000 percent increase in the number of asylum seekers in the past three
years.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1996, Ireland approved a new Refugee Act that will go into effect in
1997.  It has an expansive definition of refugee, adding to the Geneva
Convention the possibility of receiving refugee status because of persecution
due to gender, sexual orientation or trade union membership.  In addition, the
Irish Refugee Act defines "family" broadly for the purpose of regulating family
reunion for refugees.</tt><p>
<tt>Asylum seekers in Ireland are prohibited from working, but are eligible for
public assistance.  If an asylum seeker becomes the parent of an Irish born
child or marries an Irish citizen, she or he gains the right of residency and
therefore the right to work.</tt><p>
<tt>Ireland in October 1996 deported to Algeria an Algerian man who was
returning to Ireland from a visit to France and did not have a re-entry visa.
The Algerian man had entered Ireland as a student in 1991, married an Irish
citizen in 1993 and remained in the country.  His brother, who owns a
restaurant in Dublin, obtained a court order to delay the man's deportation,
but he was sent to Algiers despite the court order.</tt><p>
<tt>Irish immigration laws, like US law, do not require the government to give
any reason for refusing to issue a visa.  There is no right to appeal the
decision of an immigration officer.</tt><p>

<tt>The Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs released in October 1996 a summary
of a Proposed Parliamentary Bill on Migration Policy.  If enacted, the bill
would reduce the number of asylum-seekers through more stringent eligibility
rules for family reunification and transfer responsibility for alien affairs
from the police to the Swedish Immigration Board.  </tt><p>
<tt>Two reasons cited by the Swedish government for the change in refugee
policy are the fiscal crisis in Sweden and the influx of persons from the
former Yugoslavia.  Sweden has provided shelter for 122,000 Bosnians, more than
any other nation, on a per capita basis. </tt><p>
<tt>The Swedish government WILL continue to grant refugee status to persons
fleeing areas in which the state fails to provide protection against
persecution by other agents.</tt><p>
<tt>In the past, Sweden has denied asylum to refugees suffering persecution by
non-governmental authorities, such as Peruvians targeted by the Shining Path or
Algerians persecuted by the insurgent Armed Islamic Group.  Denying protection
to such persons has been criticized by the Human Rights Watch. </tt><p>

<tt>On November 18, the Japanese government said it will grant Japanese
citizenship to a child born out of wedlock to a Filipina woman and a Japanese
man.  In a settlement worked out at the Hiroshima District Court, the
government said it would give Japanese nationality to the child and cancel the
deportation order for the child and the mother. </tt><p>
<tt>The government's decision followed a Justice Ministry announcement in July
1996 that divorced, separated, widowed or otherwise single foreigners--even
those illegally in Japan-- who are bringing up children with at least one
Japanese parent would be granted legal residency.  If a child is born to a
foreign women out of wedlock, the Japanese father must acknowledge the baby
before birth for the mother and child to remain in Japan.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Japanese press reports, many municipalities have begun to
treat foreigners like ordinary residents; many no longer worry whether a
foreigner has overstayed his or her visa.  Local authorities are supposed to
report visa violations to the Immigration Bureau, but many do not.</tt><p>
<tt>Shinjuku Ward in Tokyo gives illegal foreign residents access to public
hospitals and schools.  Other local governments provide Japanese language
training, job placement assistance and classes on Japanese culture to foreign
residents.</tt><p>
<tt>Under current laws, local governments can hire foreign residents only if
they possess special skills, and if their job does not involve the "use of
public power." Local authorities would like to have more freedom to hire
foreign residents, especially for 3-D jobs--dirty, dangerous, and
difficult--and to help to provide government services to the growing foreign
communities.</tt><p>
<tt>The governors and mayors of several cities that have large (and growing)
foreign populations, including the Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto governments, would
like to give foreign residents the right to vote in local elections.</tt><p>
<tt>The Fukuoka District Court sentenced 18 Chinese to one year in prison,
suspended for three to four years, for illegally entering Japan from a Chinese
fishing boat on August 22, 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The Japanese birth rate hit an all-time low in 1995, down to 1.4 births per
woman.  If this low birth rate continues, Japan's population is projected to
fall from 125 million in 1996 to 55 million in the year 2100.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Japanese worry that a declining population could lead to costly
economic adjustments or a loss of world power and prestige.  Some local
governments offer financial rewards to mothers with four or more children and a
few are helping to arrange for the immigration of Filipino wives.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>In mid-November, some 2,000 police and border troops in China's Guangdong
province launched their second drill to prevent a sudden storming of the border
by Chinese citizens when the British colony reverts to Beijing's control in
July 1997.</tt><p>
<tt>Chinese authorities say they constantly battle rumors in Guangdong province
about a July 1997 amnesty for illegal immigrants in Hong Kong.  Guangdong
authorities have informed the Hong Kong police that criminal gangs on both
sides of the border tempt mainlanders with rumors of an amnesty to encourage
them to use their services to sneak into Hong Kong. </tt><p>
<tt>Newspaper reports in 1996 have said many mainland Chinese think that after
July 1997, they will be able to enter Hong Kong at will.  However, China plans
to keep Hong Kong as a distinct entity and to restrict immigration
tightly.</tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong's governor has been trying to get pledges from the European Union
nations that they will allow Hong Kong passport holders visa-free entry after
July 1, 1997.  The Benelux nations, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Sweden and the
United Kingdom currently allow visa-free access for holders of British national
overseas passports and Hong Kong Governor Patten would like these countries to
extend this right to the future holders of Special Administrative Region
passports, which Britain has agreed to do.  </tt><p>
<tt>China is expected to issue SAR passports to just under half of Hong Kong's
6.2 million residents.</tt><p>
<tt>Many EU nations are resisting visa-free entry for SAR passport holders for
fear that they would be opening themselves to Chinese immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>British citizens going to Hong Kong for employment, residency or education
will need to apply for a six-month visas before the July 1, 1997 transfer of
Hong Kong sovereignty to China.  The new visa will permit entry, but not work
or study.  This change will bring the immigration status of British citizens
into line with that of other foreign nationals in Hong Kong.  Previously,
Britons were allowed a 12-month unconditional stay in Hong Kong that permitted
work, study or vacation.</tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong's immigration chief since May 1989, Laurence Leung, resigned
suddenly in July 1996 and there are rumors that he told Beijing which Hong Kong
residents had accepted the 50,000 British passports offered to restore
confidence after the Tiananmen Square Massacre.  Other reports say that Leung
was involved in the unauthorized provision of so-called "one-way permits" to
mainland Chinese moving to Hong Kong.  Leung's wife, Kitty, and two daughters
emigrated to Canada in 1989.</tt><p>
<tt>There were reports in the press that Hong Kong's Secretary for Industry
admitted that political pressure compelled the government to adopt a labor
importation policy under which the quota of 5,000 imported workers was
eliminated.  </tt><p>
<tt>Since 1985, China's economy has grown by an average of 10.3 percent each
year.</tt><p>
<tt>An American entrepreneur has an unusual scheme to attract Chinese
investment in Fujian-- any Chinese mainlander who invests in and works for the
Fujian-based joint venture company can immigrate to the US.  Investors in the
company, which makes video cassette storage boxes, will receive stock in the
firm and a transfer to the US after they work for the company in Fujian for one
year.  </tt><p>
<tt>As US employees, they will receive health insurance, 24 paid holidays a
year and education and legal assistance.  After 15 months in the US, the
company will sponsor their applications for green cards. </tt><p>

<tt>The 18-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) met in Manila
on November 20-25, 1996 to discuss ways to achieve free trade between the
developed economy members by 2010 and for all APEC nations by 2020.  Two APEC
members, China and Taiwan, are not members of the World Trade

<tt>APEC members also endorsed free trade in computers and information

Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United

<tt>The Philippines is booming; its 70 million people have a GDP of almost $80
billion.  Economic growth will exceed seven percent in 1996 and per capita
income has risen to more than $1,000 per person per year.  However, the boom is
mostly an urban phenomena; inequality between rural and urban areas has
increased and two-thirds of Filipinos live in rural areas.</tt><p>
<tt>Philippine President Fidel Ramos announced that the economic boom has
resulted in "fewer people going abroad now...And we have people coming back."
However, Ramos reiterated his call for a global conference on migration and

<tt>There are now 350,000 foreign workers employed in Singapore, nearly 12
percent of the population.  Most of the foreign workers in Singapore are from
Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India.</tt><p>
<tt>Some believe that Singapore's reliance on foreign workers is hurting
productivity and slowing growth, especially in construction.  Construction
productivity has been falling for the last four years, a period that coincided
with the import of more foreign construction workers. </tt><p>
<tt>Cheap labor does not necessarily mean low costs.  According to a 1989
Construction Industry Development Board comparison study: in Dallas, Texas,
materials cost 80 per cent more and wages are six times higher than in
Singapore, but unit construction costs are only two to 15 per cent
higher.</tt><p>
<tt>The Singapore government will increase the maximum stay of skilled foreign
workers from eight to ten years to minimize employers' training costs.  About
seven percent of the foreign construction workers are skilled.  Construction
employers must pay a S$440 per month levy to the government companies for each
foreign worker they employ.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysian workers can continue to renew their work permits every two years.
</tt><p>
<tt>Some contractors worry that once workers are trained they will continue to
job-hop or move to countries with higher pay such as Taiwan. </tt><p>
<tt>A Singapore court has ruled that building contractors who hire foreign
workers must check their documents instead of relying upon sub-contractors to
inspect workers' documents.  The ruling was made in September in the case of a
contractor who was sentenced to 16 months jail for employing and harboring two
illegal workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Employers of foreign maids in Singapore were warned by the government on
November 21, that they faced fines if they deploy their workers to other
duties.  The Ministry of Labor reported that it found 59 cases in 1996 of
employers who had their domestics work for relatives or friends, often as
non-domestic workers in retail, food shops or factories.  </tt><p>
<tt>Singapore's work permits are valid only for the trade, occupation and
employer specified on the card.  Employers violating the law could face a fine
of up $3,500 US and/or a jail term of up to one year. </tt><p>

<tt>South Korean businesses are struggling to find workers for the 3-D (dirty,

and only 42,000 Korean fisherman.  The Korea Federation of Textile Industries
cannot fill nearly 15 percent of its jobs, up from 12 percent in 1995.  About
20 percent of heavy manufacturing jobs are vacant at small- and medium-size
businesses.  Some sectors, such as plastics and electrical machinery, are short
30 percent of their desired work force. </tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers in South Korea complain that the biggest problems for them
are poor living and working conditions, substandard wages and employer abuse.
Koreans managers are notorious for mistreating workers, both at home and in
Korean-owned factories abroad.  </tt><p>
<tt>In August, 1996, a Korean manager of a Korean-owned shoe factory in
Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City received a suspended prison sentence for lining up
and beating employees with an unfinished shoe.  Corporal punishment was
accepted in Korean work places until the 1970s.</tt><p>
<tt>The Korean government has announced plans to improve local training
programs for foreigners, cracking down on immigrants who commit crimes and
establishing a new system to track and supervise foreigners throughout their
stay in Korea.  </tt><p>
<tt>South Korea promised to change its labor laws when it joined the OECD in
1996 and became a full member of the ILO in 1991.  A 1963 law limits each work
place to one union, one union per industry and one national union
confederation, the Korean Trade Unions (FKTU), thereby making the activities of
the rival Korean Congress of Trade Unions unlawful.  </tt><p>
<tt>A 1980 law bars non-employee organizers from assisting a plant union and a
third law prevents teachers and civil servants from joining unions.  Hundreds
of union activists are in jail for violating these laws.</tt><p>
<tt>Korean employers complain that rigid labor laws limit their flexibility.
Workers can be dismissed only "for cause" and discharged workers are entitled
to 30 days severance pay per year of service.</tt><p>
<tt>South Korea is a country of 44 million, with a per capita GDP of about
$11,000 in 1996.  Seoul, which is only 30 miles from North Korea, is home to
one-fourth of all South Koreans. </tt><p>

<tt>The Council of Labor Affairs on November 14, 1996 announced that it was
reducing the maximum percentage of foreign workers in a company or factory from
32 to 35 percent to 30 percent.  There were about 239,000 foreign workers in
Taiwan in August 1996--most from Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and
Indonesia --and 300,000 unemployed Taiwanese.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to the Taiwan Labor Front, there may be a total of 450,000
foreign workers in Taiwan, including illegal workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan first admitted foreign workers in 1991 for 3-D jobs--dirty,
dangerous, and difficult--but expanded permission to employ foreign workers in
73 industrial and business categories, as well as six major manufacturing
projects on a case-by-case basis.</tt><p>
<tt>The Department of Health reported on November 15, 1996 that 24,966  foreign
workers, 10 percent of those who legally entered Taiwan, had abandoned their
jobs.  About 15,200 have been caught, which leaves almost 10,000 who have fled
their jobs</tt><p>

<tt>On November 11, 1996, the International Labor Organization released a
report, "Child Labor: Targeting the Intolerable," that estimated that 250
million children ages five to 14 work in developing countries, double previous
estimates.  About 130 million of these children work part time and 120 million
work full time.  About 60 percent of the child laborers are in Asia.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, an estimated 42 percent of the children in Kenya worked full or
part time; followed by Bangladesh, 30 percent; Haiti, 25 percent; Turkey, 24
percent; and Pakistan, 17 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>The ILO report urged stepped up enforcement and stiffer penalties for three
types of child labor:  child prostitution, slavery and the use of children in
hazardous manufacturing</tt><p>
<tt>On November 1, 1996, Bangladesh agreed to stop using children under 14 in
its 2,000-firm garment industry.  The firms exported $2.5 billion worth of
clothing in 1995-96, 60 percent to the US.  Under the agreement, the 10,500
girls now employed in the garment industry will be sent to school and each
child will receive a stipend of 300 take (US$8) per month.  Businesses caught
using child labor could lose their export licenses.</tt><p>
<tt>Children under 15 are employed in an estimated 300 types of jobs in
Bangladesh.</tt><p>
<tt>The UN on August 10 released a report on slavery throughout the world.  The
report found that more than 55 million Indian children are held in servitude
despite a 20-year old ban on slave labor. </tt><p>
<tt>In Pakistan, the UN found nearly 800 cases of employers convicted for
exploiting child labor.  The Kamiya system in Nepal keeps entire families in
slavery through buying and selling workers.  The UN investigators also found
that Burmese local authorities are using more and more forced labor in rural
areas, infrastructure projects and oil and gas prospecting. </tt><p>
<tt>Most offenses involving foreign workers found employers confiscating an
employee's passport, so that abused immigrants usually did not have residence
or work permits and were dependent upon the employer.</tt><p>
<tt>The ILO has proposed a convention to protect foreign seafarers.  The ILO
recommends a minimum monthly wage for seafarers of $435 per month for a 72-hour
work week beginning in January 1998.</tt><p>

<tt>The world's population, expected to top 5.8 billion in December 1996, is
growing at about 79 million per year (216,000 per day), reflecting 133 million
births per year (364,000 per day) and 53 million deaths per year (145,000 per
day).  The world's population is projected to reach 6.2 billion in the year
2000 and seven billion in 2010.</tt><p>
<tt>In November, the UN announced that the world's population growth had
unexpectedly slowed to 1.48 percent per year, down from an expected 1.57
percent per year.  Fertility worldwide is now about three children per woman.
If these trends continue, the world's population might be 9.4 rather than 10
billion in 2050.</tt><p>
<tt>By 2025, some five billion people, two-thirds of the world's expected
population of eight billion to nine billion, are expected to be living in
cities.  Many fast-growing cities are in developing countries and are
increasingly populated by young, unemployed men, creating a climate for rising
crime, political violence and the spread of diseases.</tt><p>
<tt>The New York metropolitan area was the world's largest city in 1950 and
third-largest in 1995.  According to UN projections, New York City will drop to
11th place by 2015, behind Tokyo; Bombay, 27 million; Lagos, 24 million;
Shanghai, 24 million; Jakarta, 21 million; Sao Paulo and Karachi.  Beijing,
Dhaka, and Mexico City will have 19 million residents each.</tt><p>
<tt>At a UN meeting in November, both Thailand and Zambia said that illegal
immigration was a major threat to their countries.</tt><p>
<tt>The World Tourism Organization reported that France attracted 61 million
foreign visitors, almost 10 percent of the world's total of 567 million,
followed by Spain and the US, with 45 million each.  The top 10
countries--including Italy, China, UK, Hungary, Mexico, Poland, and
Austria--attracted 54 percent of all foreign tourists.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, worldwide spending on
travel and tourism is projected to be $3.6 trillion in 1996, up from $3.1
trillion in 1992 and $1.9 trillion in 1987.  Travel and tourism employed an
estimated 255 million workers in 1995, up from 130 million workers worldwide in
1992 and 100 million in 1987.</tt><p>

<tt>Bangladesh formally asked Taiwan if it would receive Bangladeshi workers,
but Taiwan responded on October 11, 1996 that it does not plan to import
Bangladeshis now or in the future. </tt><p>
<tt>About two million Bangladeshis work abroad, including nearly 40 percent in
Saudi Arabia.  They remitted $1.2 billion in 1995, accounting for 41 percent of
Bangladeshi's foreign exchange.  Bangladesh began to export workers in
1987.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 25,000 Bangladeshis were returned home from the United Arab
Emirates in September, 1996 and another 8,000 were expected return after the
UAE's extended amnesty for illegal migrant workers expired on October 31, 1996.
Another 100,000 may be expelled from Malaysia.</tt><p>
<tt>The Bangladeshi government has offered to export workers to Malaysia, South
Korea, Mauritius, Brunei, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan and South Africa.  The
Bangladeshi work force is estimated at 25 million.   </tt><p>
<tt>Bangladeshis also migrate north to Assam, India.  One of the largest day
labor markets is the Indian state of Assam, in Gauhati's Laktakia quarter,
where hundreds of Bangadeshis congregate at rail and bus stations for jobs.
According to local officials, the Bangladeshis go to work on farms or in
construction, build a shelter for themselves and then send for their
families.</tt><p>
<tt>If a Bangladeshi worker can get the Indian employer to provide him with a
work permit, he can use the permit to get a ration card, which signifies that
the bearer is an Indian.  In 1993, the Indian Election Commission struck three
million names of alleged Bangladeshis from the voting rolls in Assam because
they got ration cards in this manner, but a court overturned the action.</tt><p>
<tt>About 35 percent of Assam's residents are believed to be foreigners.  Most
of the "native Assamese" immigrated from Burma in the 1300s and were later
Hinduized by immigrant Brahmans from Bihar and Orissa.  The indigenous
inhabitants of the Brahmaputra Valley are the Bodo tribes, who are opposed to
both the Bengali immigrants and the Assamese.</tt><p>
<tt>It is not clear what the Indian government intends to do about illegal
Bangladeshis.  In 1985, the Assam Accord pledged to remove all Bangladeshis who
had immigrated illegally after 1971.  On January 28, 1983, not far from
Gauhati, thousands of "illegal Bangladeshis" were killed.</tt><p>
<tt>Plans for a 600-mile border fence have not yet been implemented.  The
border police estimate that about one thousand Bangladeshis cross the border
into India each day.</tt><p>
<tt>A new book by Ashok Swain, The Environmental Trap: The Ganges River
Diversion, Bangladeshi Migration and Conflicts in India (1996), argues that
Indian water and environmental policies may be a factor that encourages
Bangladeshi migration to Assam.  Since 1975, India has diverted water from  the
River Ganges at the Farakka Barrage before the water reached the south-western
part of Bangladesh, encouraging some people there to migrate because they did
not have enough water to irrigate their crops.</tt><p>
<tt>There are some 15 million ethnic Indians scattered around the world, more
than a million in each of Burma, South Africa and the US and 700,000 in
Canada.</tt><p>
<tt>Government officials from the state of Kerala, in southern India, report
that the clampdown on foreign workers in the United Arab Emirates, will hit
them hard.  Nearly half of the 50,000 to 60,000 Indians in the UAE are
Malayalees, native from Kerala, and 90 percent are unskilled or semi-skilled
workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the run-up to Indian elections, sketches of life in rural India
emphasized that moneylenders and local power brokers still maintain an iron
grip on the countryside, where most Indians live.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC31">Foreign
Workers in the Middle East</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>About 40 percent of the population of the six Gulf nations are foreigners
and their per capita incomes, including foreign residents, have fallen sharply.
In Saudi Arabia, for example, per capita income has fallen from $19,000 in 1980
to about $7,000 in 1995, below the World Bank's line for rich countries
($7620).</tt><p>
<tt><u>Jordan.</u>  The Jordanian government is considering deporting 300,000
guest workers to reduce unemployment.  Unemployment estimates range from 15
percent to 25 percent of the 900,000 work force.  There are currently about
400,000 foreign workers in Jordan, three-fourths of whom are Egyptians.</tt><p>
<tt>Under one proposal, medicine, engineering and administrative and
secretarial positions would be closed to foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>Analysts say that most competition for employment between foreign workers
and Jordanians is in low-paying jobs.  A proposed minimum wage for Jordanian
workers might, analysts say, make employers favor foreign workers for
low-paying jobs.  </tt><p>
<tt><u>UAE.</u>  Water and power demand in the United Arab Emirates fell 10 to
15 percent since nearly 200,000 illegal foreign workers left the country,
according to government sources.  Water and electricity are heavily subsidized
in the UAE, which has 2.4 million residents.  About two-thirds of the
population, and 90 percent of the work force, are foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>Estimates of the number of illegal immigrants leaving the UAE range from
167,000 to 200,000.  Reports from the UAE say that taxis are difficult to find
and hiring a maid is almost impossible.  Work at several construction sites has
stopped.  Most of the workers who left were construction workers and service
workers in restaurants, shops and some factories.  </tt><p>
<tt>One bank official predicted that there may be a slight decline in real
growth through the rest of the year because of the departure of the foreign
workers.  One effect of the exodus has been to have illegal part-time workers
take on full-time jobs.  Employers must pay taxes on full-time employees and
provide housing. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Saudi Arabia.</u>  Saudi Arabia continues its effort to intervene in
both the demand and supply side of the labor market, denying employers
permission to import e.g. secretaries, and offering young Saudis courses in how
to be better workers.  There are about three million Saudi workers and five
million foreign workers in the country.</tt><p>
<tt>The Saudi 1995-2000 plan calls for the creation of 650,000 jobs for Saudis,
with 300,000 created by having Saudis replacing foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>Saudi Arabia's per capita income fell from about $18,000 per year in the
early 1980s to $6,000 in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Kuwait.</u> The 1.2 million foreign workers  and their families in
Kuwait are about 63 percent Kuwait's 1.9 million residents.  Since 1991, 440
foreigners were found to be HIV positive and immediately deported.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Israel. </u> Israel in November set up a camp near Tel Aviv to hold some
of the 200,000 illegal aliens in the country that it apprehends.  The camp, a
former prison annex, can accommodate 90 immigrants.  Israel plans to deport
2,000 illegal immigrants each month, up from 1996 level of 150 per
month.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the foreign workers are from Romania, Thailand, the Philippines and
African countries.  Many overstay their visas rather than return to a life of
poverty in their native lands.  At one Tel Aviv school, half the pupils are
children of foreign workers illegally living in the country.</tt><p>
<tt>The 250,000 foreign workers in Israel enter into some 3,000 fictitious
marriages each year, the Interior Ministry estimates.  Israeli women typically
receive NIS 2000 to marry a foreigner.</tt><p>
<tt>Israel will ask Thailand for 4,000 additional workers to pick fruit for
export to Japan.</tt><p>
<tt>In Palestine, the labor force is about 433,000 with unemployment estimated
to be over 50 percent.  About 18,000 Palestinians work in Israel, down from
116,000 in 1992.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC33">The
Atlantic:  Can the US afford immigration?</a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The November 1996 Atlantic includes two immigration articles.  Historian
David M. Kennedy asks "Can We Still Afford to Be a Nation of Immigrants?" and
economist George Borjas discusses "The New Economics of Immigration."</tt><p>
<tt>Kennedy begins by noting that two extremes have framed US views of
immigrants.  On the one hand, immigrants have been often praised for being the
best of their societies, the risk-takers attracted to the US by opportunity and
freedom.  The other extreme, common at the beginning of the 20th century, is
that immigrants are inferior to US-born residents--supply-push factors such as
overpopulation and joblessness push them toward the US.  Both views see
immigrants as individuals choosing where to live.</tt><p>
<tt>Two supply-push factors in Europe, says Kennedy, were responsible for mass
US immigration in the 19th century--population growth--Europe's population
doubled from 200 million to 400 million in the 1800s, even after 70 million
people emigrated--and the agricultural and industrial revolutions that
displaced rural and urban peoples.</tt><p>
<tt>Kennedy then turns to three factors that he thinks helped to integrate
immigrants in the US; their relatively low numbers, rapid economic growth, and
the varied composition and broad dispersal of the immigrants throughout the US.
The 15 percent foreign-born persons enumerated in the 1910 Census were less
than the 18 percent foreign-born in Australia, or the 20 percent foreign-born
in Canada, or the even higher percentage of foreign born in Argentina at the
turn of the century.  According to Kennedy, the diversity of immigrants meant
that no group could forever maintain its cultural identity and none could gain
political power over more than a city.</tt><p>
<tt>Kennedy argues that the same two supply-push factors--population growth and
economic change--are pushing migrants from Mexico and other countries to the US
at the end of the 20th century.  Kennedy asserts that the US can absorb the
number of immigrants arriving.  However, Kennedy says that unskilled immigrants
do not have the same economic payoff for US natives that they did a century
ago. </tt><p>
<tt>Kennedy then turns to Mexico, the source of about one-fourth of US
immigrants over the past 15 years.  He notes that the Hispanicization of the
American Southwest is sometimes called the Reconquista and goes on to speculate
that the prospect of continuing migration from a neighboring country is
unprecedented and that it is far from clear whether geographic proximity will
serve to speed integration or isolation.</tt><p>
<tt>George Borjas says that immigration policies can be compared by how they
resolve two fundamental questions: how many immigrants the country should admit
and what kinds of people they should be.  According to Borjas, there is now a
consensus that:</tt><p>
<tt>1.  The relative education or skills of successive immigrant waves have
declined over much of the postwar period, i.e., the gap between the average
years of schooling of native-born adults and recent immigrants has widened from
about 0.4 years to 1.3 years.</tt><p>
<tt>2.  Many recent immigrants will never earn as much as similar US-born
residents and, as they crowd into the low wage labor market, immigration may
account for as much as one-third of the drop in the wages of unskilled US
workers.  The net economic benefits to the US from immigration are about $7
billion per year, according to Borjas, about what the US spends on the Interior
Department, or $30 per person per year.</tt><p>
<tt>3.  Households headed by recent immigrants are more likely to receive some
type of welfare assistance than households headed by US-born persons.
Unskilled immigrants are likely to have children who also have below average
levels of schooling.</tt><p>
<tt>Borjas goes on to divide the world's people into three groups--natives,
immigrants and the persons left behind, and asks how immigration affects the
size of the economy after immigrants enter and the distribution of income.
Immigration slows wage increases, but increase the size of the economy; a 10
percent increase in the labor force is associated with a three percent drop in
wages.</tt><p>
<tt>Borjas agrees with Briggs and many other economists that the number of
immigrants admitted annually should be linked to conditions in the US
economy.</tt><p>
<tt>Furthermore, Borjas suggests several immigration policy goals and ways to
achieve them.  If the goal of immigration policy is to increase the per capita
income of the native population, then immigration policy should encourage the
entry of skilled workers.</tt><p>

OPINION BY: Mariana R. Pfaelzer<p>
<p>
OPINION: OPINION<p>
<p>
   Proposition 187 is an initiative measure which was submitted to the voters
of the State of California in the November 8, 1994 general election. It was
passed by a vote of 59% to 41% and became effective the following day. The
stated purpose of Proposition 187 is to "provide for cooperation between [the]
agencies of state and local government with the federal government, and to
establish a system of required notification by and between such agencies to
prevent illegal aliens in the United States from receiving benefits or public
services in the State of California."  Prop. 187,  @ 1. The initiative's
provisions require law enforcement, social services, health care and public
education personnel to (I)  verify the immigration status of persons with whom
they come in contact; (ii)  notify certain defined persons of their immigration
status; (iii) report those persons to state and federal officials; and (iv)
deny those persons social services, health care, and education.<p>
<p>
   After the initiative was passed, several actions challenging the
constitutionality of Proposition 187 were commenced in state and  federal
courts in California. Ultimately, five actions filed in the United States
District Court were consolidated in this Court for purposes of motions,
hearings, petitions and trial (collectively, the consolidated actions"). n1

<p>
   In addition, LULAC plaintiffs named Acting State Superintendent of Public
Instruction William Dawson ("Dawson") (Dawson has been replaced by the current
Superintendent Delaine Eastin ("Eastin")); director of Department of Social
Services Eloise Anderson ("Anderson"); Director of Department of Health
Kimberly Belshe ("Belshe"); California State Board of Education; Department of
Education;  Orange Unified School District; Tustin Unified School District; and
San Diego Unified School District.  Children plaintiffs also named Los Angeles
Unified School District and the State of California.<p>
<p>
   Ayala plaintiffs also named Dawson; Alhambra Unified School District; and
Superintendent of the Alhambra Unified School District Heber Meeks.  Gregorio
T. plaintiffs also named Dawson (who was replaced by Eastin);  Anderson;
Belshe; individuals who are the members of the California State Board of
Education, in their official capacities; individuals who are the Regents of the
University of California, in their official capacities; Jack Peltason,
president of the University of California; individuals who are the Trustees of
the California State University, in their official capacities; Barry Munitz,
the Chancellor of the California State University, individuals who are the
members of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, and
David Mertes, Chancellor of the California Community Colleges.<p>
<p>
   Catholic Hospitals, Islamic Center, and CTA, plaintiffs-in-intervention,
each filed a complaint against the same persons who were named as defendants by
the Gregorio T. plaintiffs.<p>
<p>
   n4 In February 1995, Defendants Wilson, Belshe and Anderson brought a motion
for abstention, or in the alternative, to dismiss for failure to state  claim.
Lungren joined in the motion for abstention and also moved to dismiss. In March
1995, the Court denied these motions and set this case for trial.<p>

   On November 16, 1994, the Court entered a temporary restraining order
enjoining the implementation of sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 of the initiative. On
December 14, 1995, the Court granted plaintiffs' motions for preliminary
injunction, enjoining the implementation and enforcement of those sections.<p>
<p>
   On May 1, 1995, the League of United Latin American Citizens ("LULAC") and
Gregorio T. plaintiffs brought motions for summary judgment in which they
contend that Proposition 187 is unconstitutional on the sole ground that the
initiative is preempted by the federal government's exclusive constitutional
authority over the regulation of immigration, Congress' exercise of that power
through the Immigration and Nationality Act ("INA"), and other federal
statutes. n5 n6 Defendants n7 oppose the LULAC and  Gregorio T. motions on the
grounds that Proposition 187 is not preempted and, alternatively, that if any
portion of the initiative is preempted, the remaining portions are valid and
must be upheld.<p>

<p>
   n6 Catholic Hospitals and Islamic Center brought independent motions for
summary judgment motions based on preemption as well, on May 12, 1995 and May
16, 1995, respectively. Catholic Hospitals and Islamic Center each joined in
the other's motion.<p>
<p>
   To the extent that those motions are brought on grounds other than those
raised in the LULAC and Gregorio T. motions, they are denied. To the extent
that those motions rely on the same arguments raised in the LULAC and Gregorio
T.  motions, those motions are granted in part and denied in part in accordance
with the ruling set forth in this Opinion.<p>
<p>
n7 For the purposes of this Opinion, "defendants" means all named defendants
except for the following, who do not oppose the plaintiffs' motions: (1) the
defendants who joined in the motions for summary judgment (listed in footnote

non-opposition to all motions for summary judgment filed herein; (3) Eastin,
who stipulated to the entry of summary judgment against her on July 28, 1995;

   The Court grants in part and denies in part the motions for summary judgment
in accordance with the conclusions reached below. Because the Court's ruling
with respect to these motions does not dispose of this case in its entirety,
the preliminary injunction shall remain in effect until further order of the
Court.<p>
<p>
I. Purpose and Effect of Proposition 187<p>
<p>
   Proposition 187 consists of ten sections: a preamble (section 1), a section
pertaining to the amendment and severability of the initiative (section 10) and
eight substantive sections (sections 2-9). n8 Within the eight substantive
sections of the initiative, there are the following five types of provisions:<p>
<p>
(1) provisions which require state officials to verify or determine the
immigration status of arrestees, applicants for social services and health
care,  and public school students and their parents, by either classifying
persons based on state-created categories of immigration status (the
"classification" provisions) or verifying immigration status by reference to
federal immigration laws (the "remaining verification" provisions) ( Prop. 187
@@ 4(b); 5(b), (c);  6(b), (c); 7(a)-(e); 8(a)-(c)) n9;<p>
<p>
(2) provisions which require state officials to notify individuals that they
are apparently present in the United States unlawfully and that they must
"either obtain legal status or leave the United States" (the "notification"
provisions)  ( Prop. 187  @@ 4(b)(2); 5(c)(2); 6(c)(2));<p>
<p>
(3) provisions which require state agencies to report immigration status
information to state and federal authorities, and to cooperate with the INS
regarding persons whose immigration status is suspect (contained in Sections
4-9) (the cooperation/reporting"   provisions) ( Prop. 187  @@ 4(b)(3);
5(c)(3); 6(c)(3); 7(e); 8(c); 9);<p>
<p>
(4) provisions which require facilities to deny social services, health care
services and public education to individuals based on immigration status (the
"benefit denial" provisions) ( Prop. 187  @@ 5(b), (c)(1); 6(b), (c)(1);
7(a)(c); 8(a)-(b)); and  (5) criminal penalties for falsifying immigration
documents ( Prop. 187  @@ 2,  3).<p>

   n8 The eight substantive sections of the statute are codified as follows:
Section 2 is codified at Cal. Penal Code @ 113. Section 3 is codified at Cal
Penal. Code @ 114. Section 4 is codified at Cal. Penal Code @ 834b. Section 5
is codified at Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code @ 10001.5. Section 6 is codified at
Cal.  Health &amp; Safety Code @ 130. Section 7 is codified at Cal. Educ. Code
@ 48215.  Section 8 is codified at Cal. Educ. Code @ 66010.8.<p>
<p>
   For the purposes of this Opinion, the initiative's provisions are referred
to by their initiative section numbers rather than by their California code
section numbers (i.e., Cal. Penal Code @ 834b(a) is referred to as section
4(a)").<p>
n9 The verification provisions are of two types. The first type requires state
agents to classify persons based on three state-created categories of "legal
status" without any reference to federal immigration laws. Specifically,  state
agents must determine who is a "citizen" and who is "lawfully admitted" as a
permanent resident or for a temporary period of time. @@ 5(b); 6(b); 7(d).
These provisions are referred to collectively as "classification" provisions.
The remaining verification provisions contain a "catch-all" category exempting
from Proposition 187's denial of benefits, notification and reporting
provisions persons who are otherwise lawfully present in the United States
under federal law. @@ 4(b)(1); 5(c); 6(c); 7(b), (c); 8(b). These provisions
are referred to collectively as the remaining verification" provisions.<p>
<p>

-<p>
<p>
   The initiative has a dual purpose and effect. The classification,
notification and cooperation/reporting provisions taken together constitute a
regulatory scheme designed to deter illegal aliens from entering or remaining
in the United States by (1) detecting those persons  present in the United
States in violation of either state-created criteria for lawful immigration
status or federal immigration laws; (2) notifying those persons of their
purported unlawful status and ordering them to obtain legal status or leave the
country; and (3) maintaining a system of reporting and cooperation between
state and federal agencies to effect the removal of those persons. These
provisions cannot be read except as a regulatory scheme; and indeed, defendants
have not seriously urged any other reading. While the benefits denial
provisions also have the purpose of deterring illegal aliens from entering or
remaining in the United States, and arguably may be viewed as part of the same
regulatory scheme, they have the additional purpose of forbidding the use of
public funds to provide social services, health care and education to persons
deemed to be present in the United States illegally.<p>
<p>
II. Severability of the Initiative<p>
<p>
   In determining the validity of Proposition 187, the Court is mindful of its
obligation to uphold the initiative to the fullest extent possible. California
law holds that "all presumptions favor the validity of initiative measures and
mere  doubts as to validity are insufficient." Legislature v. Eu,  54 Cal. 3d
492, 501, 286 Cal. Rptr. 283, 287, 816 P.2d 1309 (1991).  Initiatives "must be
upheld unless their unconstitutionality clearly, positively, and unmistakably
appears." Id. A finding that a section, subsection or subpart of Proposition
187 is preempted by federal law does not end the Court's inquiry with respect
to the validity of the initiative. Rather, a finding that any provision is
preempted requires the Court to determine whether that provision is severable
from the balance of the initiative so that the remainder may take effect. See
Calfarm Ins. Co. v. Deukmejian, 48 Cal. 3d 805, 821, 258 Cal.  Rptr. 161, 170,
771 P.2d 1247 (1989) (a holding that a subdivision of an initiative is invalid
under the state and federal Constitutions requires a determination as to
whether the invalid provision is severable from the initiative). Whether any
preempted provision of Proposition 187 is severable from the remainder of the
initiative is determined pursuant to California law. National Broiler Council
v. Voss, 44 F.3d 740, 748 n.12 (9th Cir. 1994).<p>
<p>
   Section 10 of Proposition 187 provides:<p>
<p>
In the event  that any portion of this act or the application thereof to any
person or circumstance is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect any
other provision or application of the act, which can be given effect without
the invalid provision or application, and to that end the provisions of this
act are severable.<p>
<p>
"'Although not conclusive, a severability clause normally calls for sustaining
the valid part of the enactment, especially when the invalid part is
mechanically severable . . . [citation]'"  Calfarm, 48 Cal. 3d at 821, 258 Cal.
Rptr. at 170 (citation omitted). The existence of a severability clause does
not conclusively resolve the severability inquiry, however. Rather, "the final
determination depends on whether 'the remainder . . . is complete in itself and
would have been adopted by the legislative body had the latter foreseen the
partial invalidity of the statute . . .' and 'is not so connected with the rest
of the statute as to be inseparable.'" Santa Barbara Sch. Dist. v. Superior
Court, 13 Cal. 3d 315, 331, 118 Cal. Rptr. 637, 650, 530 P.2d 605 (1975)
(citations omitted).<p>
<p>
   California courts have prescribed three criteria by which a reviewing court
must assess the severability of invalid provisions of statutes. In order to be
severable, "the invalid provision must be grammatically,  functionally, and
volitionally separable." Calfarm, 48 Cal. 3d at 821,  258 Cal. Rptr. at 170. A
provision is grammatically severable if "it constitutes a distinct and separate
provision . . . which can be removed as a whole without affecting the wording
of any other provision," 48 Cal. 3d at 822, 258 Cal. Rptr. at 170, or "where
the valid and invalid parts can be separated by paragraph, sentence, clause,
phrase or even single words." Santa Barbara Sch. Dist., 13 Cal. 3d at 330, 118
Cal. Rptr. at 649. However, where "the defect cannot be cured by excising any
word or group of words, the problem is quite different," and severance is
inappropriate. Santa Barbara Sch. Dist., 13 Cal. 3d at 331, 118 Cal. Rptr. at
649.<p>
<p>
   A provision is functionally severable if the remaining provisions can "stand
on their own," are capable of "separate enforcement," People's Advocate, Inc.
v. Superior Court, 181 Cal. App. 3d 316, 331-32, 226 Cal. Rptr.  640, 649
(1986), can be "given effect," Raven v. Deukmejian, 52 Cal. 3d 336, 355, 276
Cal. Rptr. 326, 338, 801 P.2d 1077 (1990), or can operate . . . independently"
of the invalid provisions. Eu, 54 Cal. 3d at 535, 286 Cal. Rptr. at 310. The
remaining provisions must neither be "rendered vague" by the absence of the
invalid provisions nor "inextricably connected to them by policy
considerations." People's Advocate, 181 Cal.  App. 3d at 332, 226 Cal. Rptr. at
649.<p>
<p>
   Finally, an invalid provision is volitionally severable if the remaining
provisions "would likely have been adopted by the people had they foreseen the
invalidity" of the challenged provision, or if the provision was not "so
critical to the enactment of [the initiative] that the measure would not have
been enacted in its absence." Calfarm, 48 Cal. 3d at 822, 258 Cal. Rptr.  at
170. Stated differently, the test [for volitional severability] is whether it
can be said with confidence that the electorate's attention was sufficiently
focused upon the parts to be severed so that it would have separately
considered and adopted them in the absence of the invalid portions." People's
Advocate, 181 Cal. App. 3d at 333, 226 Cal. Rptr. at 650. Under the volitional
severability test, even if the "'heart of [the] proposition'"  is found
invalid, if some "'substantive provisions remain,'" the invalid part should be
severed to enforce the valid provisions and achieve at least "some substantial
portion of [the voters'] purpose." Gerken v. Fair Political Practices Co., 6
Cal. 4th 707, 714-15, 25 Cal. Rptr. 2d 449, 457, 863 P.2d 694 (1993)  (quoting
City of Woodlake v. Logan, 230 Cal. App. 3d 1058, 1070, 282 Cal. Rptr. 27
(1991); Santa Barbara Sch. Dist., 13 Cal. 3d at 332, 118 Cal. Rptr. at 650).<p>
<p>
   Plaintiffs contend that Proposition 187 is not severable because its
"pervasive unconstitutionality" leaves nothing to salvage. In addition, they
argue that the provisions of the initiative fail to meet the three criteria for
severability. They contend, for example, that the classification provisions are
not grammatically severable because their absence would render the remaining
verification provisions unintelligible. They argue that none of the
verification provisions are functionally severable because their absence would
render the denial of benefits provisions inoperable. Finally, they argue that
the notification and reporting provisions are not volitionally severable from
the benefits denial provisions because the intention of the electorate in
passing the initiative was to enact a comprehensive scheme to "stop illegal
aliens," and severing the notification and reporting provisions to salvage the
benefits denial provisions would frustrate the electorate's intent.<p>
<p>
   Defendants counter that the initiative meets all three severability tests.
That is, defendants argue that the initiative is volitionally severable because
the severability clause reflects the electorate's intent to accept the
implementation of any valid provisions notwithstanding the invalidation of
others, grammatically severable because each section, subsection and subpart of
the initiative can be severed from the others without rendering remaining
sections unintelligible and functionally severable because each section,
subsection and subpart is capable of operating independently from the others.<p>
<p>
   Before analyzing the severability of each of the challenged provisions of
Proposition 187, two general comments on the grammatical and volitional
severability of the initiative as a whole are warranted. First, defendants are
correct that each of Proposition 187's ten sections, and their respective
subsections, is a distinct grammatical unit and thus is capable of being
severed from the other sections and subsections without affecting the wording
of any other section or rendering what remains unintelligible.  Accordingly,
any section or subsection within Proposition 187 which is found to be invalid
is grammatically severable from the remainder of the initiative.<p>
<p>
   Second, defendants are also correct that the initiative is volitionally
severable. Plaintiffs' contention to the contrary -- that, for example, the
denial of benefits or criminal penalties provisions would not have been adopted
had the people foreseen the success of challenges to the reporting and
notification provisions -- is unavailing. Proposition 187's declaration intent
explicitly states that a substantial purpose of the initiative is to "prevent
illegal aliens in the United States from receiving benefits or public services
in the State of California." @ 1. Elsewhere in the initiative it is stated that
it is "the intention of the People of California that only citizens of the
United States and aliens lawfully admitted . . . may receive the benefits" of
public social services, health care, and education. @@ 5(a); 6(a);  7(a); 8(a).
Further, "even though . . . the full purpose of [the  initiative] cannot be
realized, it seems eminently reasonable to suppose that those who favor the
proposition would be happy to achieve at least some substantial portion of
their purpose." Santa Barbara Sch. Dist., 13 Cal.  3d at 331-32, 118 Cal. Rptr.
at 650. It cannot be disputed that the denial of benefits to "illegal aliens"
(in sections 5 through 8) and the criminalization of the manufacture and use of
false immigration documents (in sections 2 and 3)  serve a significant part of
the initiative's purpose. The Court is therefore convinced that if the voters
had known that some of the initiative's provisions would be held invalid, they
would have preferred the implementation of the remaining portions, rather than
the invalidation of the entire initiative. Any provisions of Proposition 187
found to be invalid are volitionally severable from the remainder.<p>
<p>
   Thus, the provisions of Proposition 187 which are preempted must be severed
from the initiative. A copy of the initiative as severed in accordance withthis
Opinion follows in Appendix B. The Court's preemption analysis follows.<p>
<p>
III. Whether Proposition 187 is Preempted   Under Federal Law<p>
<p>
   The question of whether provisions of Proposition 187 are preempted by
federal law is governed by the Supreme Court's decision in De Canas v.  Bica,
424 U.S. 351, 47 L. Ed. 2d 43, 96 S. Ct. 933 (1976) (California statute
prohibiting an employer from knowingly employing an alien who is not entitled
to lawful residence in the United States held not preempted under federal law).
In De Canas, the Supreme Court set forth three tests to be used in determining
whether a state statute related to immigration is preempted. Pursuant to De
Canas, if a statute fails any one of the three tests, it is preempted by
federal law.<p>
<p>
   Under the first test, the Court must determine whether a state statute is a
"regulation of immigration." Since the "power to regulate immigration is
unquestionably exclusively a federal power, id. at 354, any state statute which
regulates immigration is "constitutionally proscribed."  Id. at 356.<p>
<p>
   Under the second test, even if the state law is not an impermissible
regulation of immigration, it may still be preempted if there is a showing that
it was the "clear and manifest purpose of Congress to effect a "complete ouster
of state power -- including state power to promulgate laws not in conflict with
federal laws" with respect to the subject matter which the statute attempts to
regulate. Id. at 357. In other words, under the second test, a statute is
preempted where Congress intended to "occupy the field" which the statute
attempts to regulate.<p>
<p>
   Under the third test, a state law is preempted if it "stands as an obstacle
to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of
Congress. Id. at 363 (citing  Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52,  67, 85 L. Ed.
581, 61 S. Ct. 399 (1941)). Stated differently, a statute is preempted under
the third test if it conflicts with federal law making compliance with both
state and federal law impossible. Michigan Canners &amp; Freezers v.
Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Board, 467 U.S. 461, 469, 81 L. Ed. 2d
399, 104 S. Ct. 2518 (1984); Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers v.  Paul, 373
U.S. 132, 142-43, 10 L. Ed. 2d 248, 83 S. Ct. 1210 (1963).<p>
<p>
   A. Whether Proposition 187 Constitutes an Impermissible Regulation of
Immigration.<p>
<p>
   The federal government possesses the exclusive power to regulate
immigration. De Canas, 424 U.S. at 354-355 ("Power to regulate immigration is
unquestionably exclusively a federal power.") That power derives from the
Constitution's grant to the federal government of the power to "establish a
uniform Rule of Naturalization," U.S. Const. art. I, @ 8, cl. 4., and to
"regulate Commerce with foreign Nations." Id., cl. 3. In addition, the Supreme
Court has held that the federal government's power to control immigration is
inherent in the nation's sovereignty. See, e.g., Nishimura Ekiu v.  United
States, 142 U.S. 651, 659, 35 L. Ed. 1146, 12 S. Ct. 336 (1892)  (recognizing
inherent power of sovereign nation to control its borders);  Plyler v. Doe, 457
U.S. 202, 225, 72 L. Ed. 2d 786, 102 S. Ct. 2382  (1982) ("Drawing upon [its
Article I, section 8] power, upon its plenary authority with respect to foreign
relations and international commerce, and upon the inherent power of a
sovereign to close its borders, Congress has developed a complex scheme
governing admission to our Nation and status within our borders");  Fiallo v.
Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 792, 52 L. Ed. 2d 50, 97 S. Ct.  1473 (1977) ("Our cases
'have long recognized the power to expel or exclude aliens as a fundamental
sovereign  attribute exercised by the Government's political departments . .
.'" (citation omitted).<p>
<p>
   Congress has exercised its power over immigration in the Immigration and
Naturalization Act, 8 U.S.C. @ 1101 et seq. (the "INA"). The INA is a
comprehensive regulatory scheme which regulates the authorized entry, length of
stay, residence status and deportation of aliens. See Gonzales v. City of
Peoria, 722 F.2d 468, 474-75 (9th Cir. 1983) (recognizing that the regulatory
scheme created by the INA is so pervasive as to be consistent with the
exclusive federal power over immigration). The INA delegates enforcement duties
to the Immigration and Naturalization Service ("INS").<p>
<p>
   Because the federal government bears the exclusive responsibility for
immigration matters, the states "can neither add to nor take from the
conditions lawfully imposed by Congress upon admission, naturalization and
residence of aliens in the United States or the several states." Takahashi v.
Fish &amp; Game Comm'n, 334 U.S. 410, 419, 92 L. Ed. 1478, 68 S. Ct. 1138
(1948). See also  Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 at 225, 72 L. Ed. 2d 786, 102 S.
Ct. 2382  (1982) ("The States enjoy no power with respect to the classification
of aliens." (citing Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 85 L. Ed. 581, 61 S. Ct.
399 (1941).<p>
<p>
   In De Canas, in reasserting the rule that "power to regulate immigration is
unquestionably exclusively a federal power," the Supreme Court emphasized that
the mere fact that a state statute pertains to aliens does not require a
finding  that it is preempted: "the Court has never held that every state
enactment which in any way deals with aliens is a regulation of immigration and
thus per se preempted by this constitutional power . . ." 424 U.S. at 355. The
Court stressed that "the fact that aliens are the subject of a state statute
does not render it a regulation of immigration, which is essentially a
determination of who should or should not be admitted into the country, and the
conditions under which a legal entrant may remain." 424 U.S. at 355.<p>
<p>
   In this case, plaintiffs urge that the entirety of Proposition 187
constitutes a scheme to regulate immigration and is therefore preempted. They
assert that the initiative as a whole is a regulation of immigration because it
forces state employees to make judgments as to an individual's immigration
status, gives them the power to effectuate removal of immigrants from the
country and thereby establishes California's own INS. Defendants counter that
pursuant to De Canas, "regulation of immigration" has a "narrow, technical
meaning"; that a facial challenge to this statute requires a "painstaking
line-by-line analysis" of the statute; and that such analysis reveals that,
standing alone, none of Proposition 187's individual sections or subsections is
"essentially a determination of who should or should not be admitted into the
country and on what terms those lawfully admitted can remain here." De Canas,
424 U.S. at 355.<p>
<p>
   In De Canas, the statute at issue provided that "no employer shall knowingly
employ an alien who is not entitled to lawful residence in the United States if
such employment would have an adverse effect on lawful resident workers." Id.
at 352 n. 1; Cal. Lab. Code @ 2805. Noting that in that case,  California had
"sought to strengthen its economy by adopting federal standards in imposing
criminal sanctions against state employers who knowingly employ aliens who have
no federal right to employment within the country," the Supreme Court found
that the statute did not constitute an immigration regulation, but rather, had
only "some purely speculative and indirect impact on immigration." Id. at
355.<p>
<p>
   Unlike the statute at issue in De Canas, various of Proposition 187's
provisions have much more than a "purely speculative and indirect impact on
immigration." Indeed, Proposition 187's verification, notification and
cooperation/reporting requirements directly regulate immigration by creating a
comprehensive scheme to detect and report the presence and effect the removal
of illegal aliens. The scheme requires state agents to question all arrestees,
applicants for medical and social services, students, and parents of students
about their immigration status; to obtain and examine documents relating to the
immigration status of such persons; to identify "suspected" "illegal"
immigrants present in California; to report suspected "illegal" immigrants to
state and federal authorities; and to instruct people suspected of being in the
United States illegally to obtain "legal status" or "leave the country." Thus,
Proposition 187's scheme has a direct and substantial impact on immigration.<p>
<p>
   Further, certain of Proposition 187's provisions require state agents to
make independent determinations of who is subject to the initiative's benefits
denial, notification and cooperation/reporting provisions and who may lawfully
remain in the United States. Unlike the statute at issue in De Canas, which
adopted federal standards to determine whether an individual's immigration
status subjected an employer to liability, Proposition 187's classification
provisions create an entirely independent set of criteria by which to classify
individuals based on immigration status. See, e.g.,  Prop. 187  @@ 5(b); 6(b);
7(d).<p>
<p>
   On the other hand, the benefits denial provisions of sections 5 through 8
may be likened to the statute at issue in De Canas. While the denial of
benefits to persons not lawfully present in the United States may indirectly or
incidentally affect immigration by causing such persons to leave the state or
deterring them from entering California in the first place, such a denial does
not amount to a "determination of who should or should not be admitted into the
country." De Canas, 424 U.S. at 355. Accordingly, the benefits denials
provisions are not impermissible regulations of immigration and thus are not
preempted under the first De Canas test.<p>
<p>
   It is true, as plaintiffs argue, that benefits denial can only occur after
an applicant's legal status has been "determined." That is, absent
verification process, eligibility for benefits based on immigration status
would be impossible. Moreover, state agents are unqualified--and also
unauthorized--to make independent determinations of immigration status.
Congress has exclusively reserved that power to the INS and to immigration
judges pursuant to the INA. See  8 U.S.C. @ 1252(b); 8 C.F.R. @ 242.1(a).
Indeed, determinations of immigration status by state agents amounts to
immigration regulation whether made for the purposes of notifying aliens of
their unlawful status and reporting their presence to the INS or for the
limited purpose of denying benefits.<p>
<p>
   Defendants contend that because state agents are required to and do make
determinations of immigration status in administering benefits under certain
federal-state cooperative programs, eligibility for which Congress has
conditioned on lawful immigration status, such determinations may also be made
by state agents for purposes of denying benefits under Proposition 187. Indeed,
the Systematic Alien Verification for  Entitlements program ("SAVE"),  42
U.S.C. @ 1320b-7, is an existing federal eligibility system used to verify
status for various federal-state cooperative programs such as the Aid to
Families with Dependent Children ("AFDC"), Food Stamps, Medicaid and
Unemployment Compensation programs under which eligibility is dependent on
lawful immigration status. See  42 U.S.C. @ 1320b-7(b)(1) and 45 C.F.R. @
233.50 (AFDC); 42 U.S.C. @@ 1320b-7(b)(2) and 1396b(v)(1) (Medicaid);<p>
7 U.S.C. @ 2015(f) and 42 U.S.C. @ 1320b-7(b)(4) (Food Stamps). These benefits
programs require state agents to verify immigration status by accessing federal
immigration status information through SAVE. In administering state-federal
cooperative benefits programs, however, state agents perform a ministerial
rather than a discretionary function in verifying immigration status. That is,
state agents merely access INS information to verify an applicant's immigration
status -- no independent determinations are made and no state-created criteria
are applied. A requirement that state agents merely verify immigration status
by referring to INS information is much different from a requirement that state
agents actually make determinations as to who is, and who is not, deportable
under federal law. Permitting state agents, who are untrained -- and
unauthorized -- under federal law to make immigration status decisions, incurs
the risk that inconsistent and inaccurate judgments will be made. On the other
hand, requiring state agents simply to verify a person's status with the INS
involves no independent judgment on the part of state officials and ensures
uniform results consistent with federal determinations of immigration status.<p>
<p>
   The benefits denial provisions of Proposition 187 may therefore be
implemented without impermissibly regulating immigration if state agencies, in
verifying eligibility for services and benefits, rely on federal determinations
of status made by the INS and accessible through SAVE. Because state
regulations implementing Proposition 187 could require state agencies to verify
immigration status through reference to INS information and could deny state
actors discretion to apply non-federal criteria for benefits eligibility,
Proposition 187's benefits denial provisions are not an impermissible
regulation of immigration and therefore withstand scrutiny under the first De
Canas test.<p>
<p>
   Accordingly, the classification, notification and cooperation/reporting
provisions of the initiative, contained in sections 4 through 9 and in the
preamble, which are aimed solely at regulating immigration, are preempted. The
provisions which have the permissible purpose and effect of denying
state-funded benefits to persons who are unlawfully present in the United
States are not a regulation of immigration and therefore survive the first De
Canas test.<p>
<p>
   1. Section 4<p>
<p>
   Section 4, entitled "Law Enforcement Cooperation with the INS," requires law
enforcement agencies to verify the legal status of every arrestee who is
"suspected of being present in the United States in violation of federal
immigration laws" by "questioning the person" and "demanding documentation." @
4(b)(1). Section 4 requires law enforcement agencies to "notify the person of
his or her apparent status as an alien who is present in the United States in
violation of federal immigration laws and inform him or her that . . . he or
she must either obtain legal status or leave the United States. @ 4(b)(2). In
addition, section 4 requires the agency to "notify the Attorney General . . .
and the [INS] of the apparent illegal status." @ 4(b)(3). Finally, section 4
requires law enforcement agencies to "fully cooperate with the [INS] regarding
any person who is arrested if he or she is suspected" of being in the United
States illegally and prohibits any local governmental agency from limiting such
cooperation in any way. @ 4(a), (c).<p>
<p>
   Under the first De Canas test, a state may not require its agents to (i)
make independent determinations of who is and who is not in this country in
violation of immigration laws;" (ii) report such determinations to state and
federal authorities; or (iii) "cooperate" with the INS, solely for the purpose
of ensuring that such persons leave the country. The sole stated purpose and
the sole effect of section 4 is to impermissibly regulate immigration.
Accordingly, section 4 is entirely preempted by federal law under the first De
Canas test. <p>
<p>
   2. Sections 5 and 6<p>
<p>
   Section 5, entitled "Exclusion of Illegal Aliens from Public Social
Services," and section 6, entitled, "Exclusion of Illegal Aliens from Publicly
Funded Health Care," differ from section 4 in that their stated purpose and
effect is not solely to ensure the ouster of persons suspected of  being in
this country unlawfully. Rather, they have the additional purpose and effect of
excluding persons from obtaining public social and health care services. To the
extent that state actors deny benefits to persons based on determinations by
federal authorities that those individuals are deportable pursuant to federal
law, benefits denial is not a direct regulation of immigration, but rather, has
only the possible indirect effect of deterring "illegal" aliens from coming to
California or causing them to leave.<p>
<p>
   Sections 5 and 6 do not merely deny benefits, however. Both sections contain
classification, notification and cooperation/reporting provisions which are
roughly parallel those contained in section 4. See @@ 5(b), (c)(1), (c)(2);
6(b), (c)(1), (c)(2). These provisions are entirely unnecessary to the
implementation of the benefits denial provisions. That is, without those three
sets of provisions, both sections 5 and 6 still require public entities and
publicly-funded health care facilities to deny benefits to persons who are
determined to be in the United States in violation of federal law. See @@
5(c)(1), 6(c)(1). n10 <p>

   n10 As explained above, the benefits denial provisions in subsection (c) of
sections 5 and 6 may be constitutionally implemented only through a regulation
whereby state agents do not themselves determine a whether a person is lawfully
present in the United States and only verify a person's immigration status for
benefits denial purposes by relying on determinations made by the INS and
accessible through SAVE.<p>

<p>
   The classification, notification and cooperation/reporting provisions in
sections 5 and 6 add nothing to the statute except that they expand Proposition
187's impermissible scheme of immigration regulation -- by requiring agents of
the state (i) to make independent determinations of who is and who is not
"lawfully admitted" in this country, based on state-created criteria
(subsection (b)); and (ii) to report such determinations to state and federal
authorities solely for the purpose of ensuring that such persons leave the
country (subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2)).<p>
<p>
   In addition, subsection (b) is an impermissible immigration regulation
because, unlike the statute at issue in De Canas, the classification of persons
as (1) citizens; (2) lawfully admitted as a permanent resident or (3) lawfully
admitted for a temporary period is not in any way tied to federal standards.
Thus, the state has created its own scheme setting forth who is, and who is
      not, entitled to be in the United States. As discussed below, the INS's
standards for who is and who is not deportable are entirely different from
those set forth in subsection (b). See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. @ 1251(a). As the
Supreme  Court held in De Canas, a state cannot, on its own, determine who is
or is not entitled to be present in the United States. See De Canas, 424 U.S.
at 355.<p>
<p>
   Defendants contend that the Court should construe the term "lawfully
admitted" in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) as applying "to persons who are
present in the United States unlawfully, not to those who entered unlawfully."
They argue that such a construction avoids preemption, because "lawfully
present" is an immigration status standard applied under the INA, and thus the
classification of persons required under subsection (b) of sections 5 and 6
would be tied to federal standards, rather than to state-created criteria. This
argument is not persuasive. As plaintiffs point out, the term "lawfully
admitted" has its own established meaning under the INA. See  8 U.S.C. @ 1182.
n11 Thus, there is no basis for the Court to replace the word "admitted," with
the word "present." Moreover, even if the Court were to do so, the statute
still would not be tied to federal standards.<p>
<p>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
-<p>
n11 Those lawfully "admitted" under federal immigration law are those who an
immigration officer determines to satisfy admissibility criteria at the time of
entry. 8 U.S.C. @ 1182. Thus, it is likely that there are aliens who are
lawfully present in the United States, but who were never lawfully "admitted"
as federal law defines that term. These include, for example, persons who
entered illegally but then were granted asylum under 8 U.S.C. @ 1158.
Conversely, some aliens who were lawfully "admitted" under the INA, but have
overstayed their visas, may no longer be lawfully present. The plain language
of subsection (b)(3) would include these aliens while the construction urged by
defendants would exclude them.<p>

<p>
   The impermissible classification, notification, and cooperation/reporting
requirements of sections 5 and 6, subsections (b), (c)(2), and (c)(3), are
therefore preempted.<p>
<p>
   In the absence of the scheme created by those sections, the remaining
substantive provisions of sections 5 and 6 are contained in subsections 5(c)(1)
and 6(c)(1). Those provisions, standing alone, require that state agents deny
benefits to persons who are determined or suspected to be "in the United
States in violation of federal law. Defendants contend that (c)(1) is not an
immigration regulation because, absent the classification, notification, and
reporting provisions, (c)(1)'s effect is solely to deny benefits -- not to
determine who should or should not be permitted to remain in the United
States.<p>
<p>
   Indeed, in the absence of subsections (b), (c)(2) and (c)(3), subsection
(c)'s verification component is utilized solely for the purpose of denying
benefits. Unlike subsection (b), subsection (c)(1)'s verification component is
tied to federal immigration standards, so that under subsection (c)(1),
benefits are denied based on an individual's federally-determined immigration
status and not on any independent criteria developed by the state.<p>
<p>
   Plaintiffs counter that (c)(1) is not tied to any federal or state
immigration standards and is therefore preempted because, on its face,
subsection (c)(1) would deny benefits not only to aliens who are deportable
under federal immigration law but also to aliens who have, for example, failed
to file their tax returns, because technically such persons would be "alien[s]
in the United States in violation of federal law." This is a tortured reading
of the provision. The Court is obliged to uphold subsection (c)(1) if there is
any construction of the provision which is constitutional. Clearly (c)(1) can,
and should, be understood to require denial of benefits solely to deportable
aliens (i.e., those aliens whose presence in the United States is in violation
of federal immigration law). The Court must conclude that subsection (c)(1)
denies benefits based on federal determinations of immigration status and is
not an impermissible regulation of immigration. Such benefits denial is not
preempted under the first De Canas test.<p>
<p>
   One additional problem remains. Subsection (c)(1) requires state agents to
deny benefits to any individual who is "determined or "reasonably suspected" to
be present in the United States in violation of federal law. Thus, on its face,
(c)(1) requires state actors to make independent determinations as to whether a
person is deportable under federal law. As discussed above, under the first De
Canas test, state actors may not make independent determinations as to persons'
immigration status. Only the INS can make such determinations, and so (c)(1)
may survive only if benefits are denied only to those persons determined to be
deportable by the INS. This problem is not irremediable, however. If the words
"or reasonably suspects, based on the information provided to it," are severed
from the subsection (c), sections 5 and 6 no longer would deny benefits to
persons who are merely suspected by a state agent, rather than determined by
the INS, to be deportable. And those words indeed are grammatically,
functionally, and volitionally severable. The language "or reasonably suspects,
based on the information provided to it," is grammatically severable, since
when it is omitted, the remaining language makes sense. The offending language
is also functionally severable, because denial of benefits  can be implemented
in its absence.  That is, a person can be denied benefits if the administrating
agent "determines," rather than merely "reasonably suspects . . ." that the
person is present in the country in violation of federal laws. Finally, the
"reasonably suspects" language is volitionally severable because the
severability clause evidences the intent of the electorate to permit the
severance of offending portions, and because it cannot be argued that the
language was crucial to the passage of the initiative.     Even in the absence
of the "reasonably suspects" language, however, it is still possible that under
subsection (c)(1) state actors could be required to deny benefits based on
their own independent determinations as to persons' immigration status. To
avoid this result, the state could implement a regulation requiring officials
to verify eligibility for services and benefits by accessing INS determinations
of individuals' immigration status through the SAVE system. If the "reasonably
suspects" language is omitted, and a regulation implementing the benefits
denial provisions required state agencies to utilize INS determinations in
denying benefits, subsection (c)(1) would not impermissibly regulate
immigration.  It would then withstand scrutiny under the first De Canas test.<p>
<p>
   The question remains whether the invalid provisions of sections 5 and 6 are
severable from the remainder of the initiative. Plaintiffs contend that
subsections (b), (c)(2) and (3) are not functionally severable from the
remaining provisions in sections 5 and 6 and that a finding that subsections
(b), (c)(2) and (c)(3) are preempted requires a finding that all of sections 5
and 6 are preempted. However, as set forth above, subsection (c)(1) can operate
independently as a benefits denial provision absent the impermissible
immigration regulation scheme. Therefore, subsections (b), (c)(2) and (c)(3)
are functionally severable from the initiative. Because it is reasonable to
conclude that the electorate would have preferred the implementation of the
benefits denial provisions rather than the invalidation of the entire
initiative had they foreseen the invalidity of the classification, notification
and cooperation/reporting provisions, subsections (b), (c)(2) and (c)(3) are
volitionally severable. Finally, subsection (c)(1) makes grammatical sense
absent the severed provisions. Accordingly, subsections (b), (c)(2) and (c)(3)
are severable.<p>
<p>
   3. Section 7<p>
<p>
   Section 7 is entitled "Exclusion of Illegal Aliens From Public Elementary
and Secondary Schools." Like sections 5 and 6, section 7 contains
classification, notification and cooperation/reporting requirements that, taken
together, serve only to further the scheme to regulate immigration and are
unnecessary to the denial of public education.<p>
     In section 7, subsections (a) through (c) require schools to verify the
immigration status of children for the purposes of denying access to public
elementary and secondary education. Subsection (d) requires verification of the
immigration status of parents of school children. Subsection (e) requires
school districts to report the "illegal" status of any parent, guardian,
enrollee or pupil to state agencies and the INS. Subsection (f) requires school
districts to "fully cooperate" in "accomplishing an orderly transition to a
school in the child's country of origin."<p>
<p>
   Subsections (a), (b) and (c), together, assure that undocumented children
will be denied access to public education. Subsection (d) is wholly unnecessary
to implementing the denial of education mandated by section 7, because the
state has no  need to know the immigration status of parents in order to deny
benefits to children. Like subsection (b) in sections 5 and 6, the only purpose
and effect of subsections (d), (e), and (f) is to ensure that persons
determined by the state to be in the United States unlawfully are
"transitioned" to the "country of their origin." Subsections (d), (e) and (f)
are part of an impermissible scheme to regulate immigration and are therefore
preempted under the first De Canas test.<p>
<p>
   In any event, an analysis of section 7 under the rigors of the first De
Canas test is not necessary to sustain the Court's ruling on these motions. In
light  of the United States Supreme Court's decision in Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S.
202, 72 L. Ed. 2d 786, 102 S. Ct. 2382 (1982), in which the Court held that the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from
excluding undocumented alien children from public schools, section 7 in its
entirety conflicts with and is therefore preempted by federal law.<p>
<p>
   4. Section 8<p>
<p>
   Subsection (a) of Section 8 prohibits public postsecondary educational
institutions from providing education to persons who are not "authorized under
federal law" to be in the United States. Subsection (b) requires such
institutions to verify the immigration status of each person enrolled or
attending to ensure that education is provided only to persons who are
"authorized under federal law" to be in the United States. Subsection (c)
requires admissions officers to report any persons who are "determined to be,
or . . . under reasonable suspicion of being in the United States in violation
of federal immigration laws" to state and federal authorities.<p>
<p>
   Subsection 8(c), like the reporting requirements in sections 5 and 6, cannot
survive because it has no purpose other than to regulate immigration. On the
other hand, subsections (a) and (b), like the denial of benefits in sections 5
and 6, are not regulations of immigration since they do not amount to
determinations of who may and may not remain in this country. In the absence of
subsection (c)'s reporting requirements, the verification components of
subsections (a) and (b) are permissible because their only purpose is to
determine who may and who may not receive postsecondary education. Also, the
verification components of subsections (a) and (b) are tied to federal
standards rather than to an impermissible state classification scheme. Because
subsections (a) and (b) may be implemented by requiring state actors to rely on
federal determinations rather than their own independent determinations of
immigration status to deny public postsecondary education, subsections (a) and
(b) are not preempted under the first De Canas test.<p>
<p>
   The final question is whether subsection (c) is functionally, volitionally
and grammatically severable from the remaining provisions of section 8. Since
the absence of the impermissible reporting requirements does not impair the
state's ability to deny public postsecondary education, subsection (c) is
functionally severable. Subsection (c) is grammatically severable because the
removal of subsection (c) does not render the remaining provisions of section 8
unintelligible. Finally, because it is reasonable to conclude that the
electorate would have preferred the implementation of the remaining provisions
rather than the invalidation of the entire section had they foreseen the
invalidity of the cooperation/reporting provision, subsection (c) is
volitionally severable.<p>
<p>
   5. Section 9<p>
<p>
   Section 9, entitled, "Attorney General cooperation with the INS," requires
the state attorney general to maintain records of, and to transmit to the INS,
all reports received from state agencies pertaining to persons who are
"suspected of being present in the United States in violation of federal
immigration laws." This section is preempted under the first De Canas test
because it has no purpose or effect except to further Proposition 187's
impermissible immigration regulation scheme.<p>
<p>
   Section 9 is a separate and distinct section of Proposition 187, the
severance of which does not impair the meaning of any remaining sections. It
is, therefore, grammatically severable from the remainder of the initiative.
Section 9 is functionally severable because it merely imposes additional
reporting and record-keeping requirements beyond those required by the other
sections of the initiative and eliminating these additional requirements does
not impair the operation of the remaining sections. Finally, because the
initiative's remaining benefits denial and criminal penalty provisions serve a
substantial purpose of the electorate and would have been approved even absent
the invalid provisions, section 9 is volitionally severable. n12<p>

<p>
Therefore, the People of California declare their intention to provide for
cooperation between their agencies of state and local government with the
federal government, and to establish a system of required notification by and
between such agencies to prevent illegal aliens in the United States from
receiving benefits or public services in the State of California.<p>
<p>
(emphasis added). Since Proposition 187's cooperation/reporting requirements
are preempted, the underlined portion of the preamble states an impermissible
purpose. However, because the preamble has no practical effect absent the
invalid substantive provisions, it is not subject to the preemption inquiry.<p>

   6. Sections 2 and 3<p>
<p>
   Sections 2 and 3 criminalize making and using false documents "to conceal"
the "true citizenship or resident alien status" of a person. These provisions,
though they may indirectly affect immigration in some way, n13 can hardly be
said to be a "determination of who should or should not be admitted in to the
country." Like the benefit denial provisions, the criminal penalties,
criminalizing conduct that is dishonest and deceptive, are a legitimate
exercise of the police power of the state.<p>

   Plaintiffs contend that criminal penalties are part of the overall
immigration regulation scheme. Absent the verification, notification and
cooperation/reporting elements of the initiative, however, the criminal
penalties do not serve the impermissible goal of ensuring that "illegal" aliens
leave the country. Accordingly, sections 2 and 3 are not preempted under the
first De Canas test.<p>
 <p>
   B. Whether Proposition 187 Is Preempted Because Congress Intended to Occupy
the Field.<p>
<p>
   Under the second De Canas test, even if a statute is not an impermissible
regulation of immigration, it may still be preempted if there is a showing that
Congress intended to "occupy the field" which the statute attempts to regulate.
De Canas, 424 U.S. at 357.<p>
<p>
   As discussed above, the Constitution commits the power to regulate
immigration exclusively to the federal government. De Canas, 424 U.S. at 354,
356. Congress has fully occupied the field of immigration regulation through
enactment and implementation of the INA. See, e.g., Gonzales v. City of Peoria,
722 F.2d 468 (9th Cir. 1983) ("We assume that the civil provisions of the [INA]
regulating authorized entry, length of stay, residence status, and deportation,
constitute such a pervasive regulatory scheme, as would be consistent with the
exclusive federal power over immigration."). Since the classification,
notification and cooperation/reporting requirements contained in sections 1 and
4 through 9 constitute  a scheme to regulate immigration, those provisions are
necessarily preempted under the second De Canas test as well.<p>
 <p>
   Because the Court has determined that the benefits denial and criminal
provisions in sections 2 and 3 are not impermissible regulations of
immigration, the question remains whether these provisions are nevertheless
preempted because Congress has intended to occupy the field on which they
touch. Under the second De Canas test, the benefits denial provisions of
sections 5 through 8 are preempted only if they regulate a field in which
Congress intended a "complete ouster" of state power, even if a state
regulation in that field is not in conflict with federal law. See  De Canas,
424 U.S. at 356, 357. In De Canas, the Supreme Court defined the field on which
the statute in question touched not as the broad field of immigration
regulation, but, rather, the more narrow field of employment of illegal aliens.
Id. Finding nothing in the INA which indicated Congressional intent to preclude
state regulation touching on the employment of illegal aliens, the Court
refused to "presume that Congress . . . intended to oust state authority to
regulate the employment  relationship covered by the [statute]," and held that
the statute was not preempted. Id. at 357.<p>
<p>
   Similarly, the field on which Proposition 187's benefits denial provisions
touch is not the broad field of immigration regulation but, rather, the public
benefits field, specifically alien eligibility for public benefits. Since
nothing in the wording or legislative history of the INA "unmistakably
confirms" an intent to oust state authority to regulate in the public benefits
field, and because, as in De Canas, such an intent cannot be "derived from the
scope and detail of the INA . . . governing entry and stay of aliens," id. at
359, Proposition 187's benefits denial provisions are not preempted under the
second De Canas test. n14<p>
<p>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

<p>
   n14 The Court in De Canas also recognized that because certain federal
legislation pertaining to farm labor contractor registration explicitly
contemplated supplementary and consistent "appropriate State law and
regulation," 7 U.S.C. @ 2051, the INA could "not be taken as legislation by
Congress expressing its judgment to have uniform federal regulations in matters
affecting employment of illegal aliens, and therefore barring state
legislation" such as the statute at issue.  De Canas, 424 U.S. at 361-62.
Likewise in this case, the public benefits scheme in this country is
predominantly a cooperative federal-state effort based on voluntary state
participation in federally-funded public benefits programs such as AFDC,
Medicaid and Food Stamps and the states' optional provision of state funded
public benefits not within the federal scheme. Thus, it cannot be said that the
INA was unmistakably intended to preclude states from regulating, to the extent
consistent with federal law, the provision of public benefits and services.<p>

<p>
   Likewise, the criminal provisions set forth in sections 2 and 3 are not
preempted under the second De Canas test. Plaintiffs have made no showing
whatsoever that Congress intended to effect a "complete ouster of state power
-- including state power to promulgate laws not in conflict with federal laws"
with respect to criminalizing the falsification and use of forged
identification documents. 424 U.S. at 357. The field on which sections 2 and 3
touch is not the broad field of immigration regulation but, rather, the field
of the criminal law as it relates to false documents. Since nothing in the
legislative history of the INA, or in the INA itself, reveals an intent to oust
state authority to criminalize the production or use of false identification,
sections 2 and 3 are not preempted under the second De Canas test.<p>
<p>
   C. Whether Proposition 187 Is Preempted Because It Directly Conflicts With
Federal Law<p>
<p>
   The final inquiry under De Canas is whether, "although the INA contemplates
some room for state legislation," De Canas, 424 U.S. at 363, Proposition 187 is
preempted in whole or in part because it "stands as an obstacle to the
accomplishment and execution of  the full purposes and objectives of
Congress." Id. (citing  Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67, 85 L. Ed. 581, 61
S. Ct. 399 (1941)). Stated differently, the provisions of Proposition 187 may
be preempted because they conflict with federal law making compliance with both
state and federal law impossible. Michigan Canners &amp; Freezers, 467 U.S. at
469.<p>
<p>
   1. Classification, Notification, and Reporting Provisions<p>
<p>
   As set forth above, Proposition 187's classification, notification and
cooperation/reporting provisions are preempted under the first and second De
Canas tests because taken together, they constitute an impermissible scheme for
the regulation of immigration. Those same provisions also violate the third De
Canas test, because they are in conflict with federal laws governing the
deportation of aliens.<p>
<p>
   The INA specifies an exclusive list of grounds for deportation, 8 U.S.C.
1251(a), and provides that that procedure shall be the "sole and exclusive
procedure for determining the deportability of an alien." 8 U.S.C. @ 1252(b)
(emphasis added). The procedure requires, among other things, that only a
"special inquiry officer" (an immigration judge) may conduct deportation
proceedings. Id. The INA's accompanying regulations require "every proceeding
to determine the deportability of an alien in the United   States [to be]
commenced by the filing of an order to show cause with the Office of the
Immigration Judge." 8 C.F.R. @ 242.1(a); 8 U.S.C. 1252a. The authority to issue
such orders is delegated to a discrete list of federal officers. Id. Only
specified federal officials can commence deportation proceedings, and only an
immigration judge in deportation proceedings can determine that an alien is
deportable and order the alien to leave the United States. Id.; 8 U.S.C. @@
1252(a), 1252(b). Then, after a "final order" of deportation issues, only the
Attorney General may "effect the alien's departure from the United States." 8
U.S.C. @ 1252(c).<p>
<p>
   Proposition 187's classification, notification and cooperation/reporting
provisions directly contradict the INA's mandate that the procedure outlined in
the INA "shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining the
deportability of an alien." These provisions create a new, wholly independent
procedure, pursuant to which state law enforcement, welfare, health care, and
education  officials--rather than federal officials and immigration judges--are
required to determine the deportability of aliens and effect their deportation.
The classification, notification and cooperation/ reporting provisions delegate
to state agents tasks which federal law delegates exclusively to federal
agents. These provisions are in direct conflict with and are preempted by
federal law.<p>
 <p>
   2. Denial of Benefits Provisions<p>
<p>
   a. Conflicts based on classification and remaining verification provisions
 Proposition 187 requires, for the implementation of its benefits denial
provisions, that public social service agencies, public health care facility
personnel, public school districts and postsecondary educational institutions
classify or verify the immigration status of applicants for benefits and
services.<p>
<p>
   Plaintiffs argue that because the classification provisions define legal
immigration status more narrowly than federal law, and because the remaining
verification provisions require state agents to classify persons' immigration
status based on "suspicion," those provisions will result in the denial of
benefits to persons who fail to meet state criteria but are nevertheless
lawfully present in the United States under federal law. The plaintiffs contend
that both types of verification provisions are preempted under the third De
Canas test.<p>
<p>
   Defendants argue that the initiative "does not set up a classification
system" at all and that the classification provisions, like the remaining
verification provisions which are tied to federal standards, should be
construed as applying only to persons who are present in the United States in
violation of federal immigration laws.<p>
<p>
   (1) The classification provisions<p>
<p>
   As discussed above, Proposition 187 establishes three state-created
categories of lawful immigration status on which the denial of benefits is
based. These categories define persons as "legal" and entitled to receive
benefits if they are citizens of the United States, aliens lawfully admitted as
permanent residents and aliens lawfully admitted for a temporary period of
time. See @@ 5(b)(1)-(3), 6(b)(1)-(3), 7(d)(1)-(3). These three categories,
however, fail to recognize several federal categories of persons who are not
citizens, not admitted as permanent residents and not admitted for a temporary
period of time but who are nevertheless present in  the United States,
authorized to remain here and eligible for certain benefits in accordance with
federal law. For example, federal law authorizes certain refugees, n15 asylees,
n16 persons granted withholding of deportation, n17 parolees, n18 persons
protected by "family unity" status, n19 persons present under temporary
protected status, n20 persons granted deferred enforced departure ("DED"), n21
persons eligible for suspension or stay of deportation n22 and battered
immigrant women and children n23 to remain in the United States permanently,
indefinitely or temporarily. None of these categories of lawful immigration
status is accounted for by  Proposition 187's classification scheme.<p>

   Sections 5, 6 and 7 utilize this underinclusive classification scheme to
deny benefits and services to persons who fail to meet state criteria for
lawful immigration status but are lawfully present in the United States and
entitled to receive benefits and services under federal law. Congress has
conditioned eligibility for some federal-state cooperative benefits programs
covered by sections 5 and 6 on lawful immigration status under federal
immigration laws. For example, eligibility for the Medicaid, Aid to Families
with Dependent Children ("AFDC") and Food Stamps programs depends on
verification of immigration status through the SAVE system. In administering
these programs, state agencies verify recipient immigration status by accessing
INS information. Since some persons otherwise eligible for benefits under
federal standards would be excluded by Proposition 187's underinclusive
classification scheme, denying services based on the classification scheme
conflicts with the existing federal eligibility system for programs
administered under SAVE. This classification scheme, preempted under the first
and second De Canas tests, is also preempted under the third De Canas test as
used to deny social and health services under sections 5 and 6 and education
under section 7.<p>
<p>
   The question remains whether the impermissible classification scheme in
subsection (b) of sections 5 and 6 and subsection (d) of section 7 is severable
from the remainder of the initiative. The subsections are grammatically
severable because their absence does not render the remaining subsections
unintelligible. The subsections are functionally severable because the benefits
denial provisions may be implemented by utilizing the remaining verification
provisions in subsection (c) of sections 5 and 6 and subsections (b) and (c) of
section 7 which bases denial of benefits and services on federal immigration
standards. Finally, the subsections  are volitionally severable because it
cannot be said that voter approval of the initiative was dependent on any
particular classification scheme as long as the effect was the denial of
benefits and services to illegal aliens. Thus, subsection (b) of section 5 and
6 and subsection (d) of section 7 are preempted by federal law but may be
severed from the remainder of the initiative.<p>
<p>
   (2) The remaining verification provisions<p>
<p>
   Subsection (c) of sections 5 and 6 provides that if any public entity
"determines or reasonably suspects, based on the information provided to it,"
that an applicant for benefits or services is an "alien in the United States in
violation of federal law," the entity shall deny the benefits or services. @@
5(c), 6(c). Subsection (b) of sections 7 and 8 likewise calls for verification
of status based on federal immigration standards by requiring school districts
and postsecondary educational institutions to verify that students and/or
parents are "authorized under federal law to be present in the United States."
@@ 7(b), 8(b). Because these provisions require verification by reference to
federal immigration standards, conflict with that law is not readily apparent.
Because Congress conditions eligibility for benefits under the AFDC, Food
Stamps and Medicaid programs on lawful immigration status and requires state
agents to verify applicant eligibility by accessing INS information through the
SAVE system, section 5's denial of benefits to persons "in the United States in
violation of federal law" does not conflict with or impede the objectives of
federal law. Section 5 is not preempted to the extent that it applies to
federally funded programs for which Congress has conditioned benefit
eligibility on lawful immigration status.<p>
<p>
   Plaintiffs contend, however, that the verification procedure required by
subsection (c) of sections 5 and 6, based on the reasonable suspicion of state
agents, cannot be constitutionally implemented because denying benefits to
those merely suspected of being present in violation of federal laws conflicts
with federal law which entitles those lawfully present in the United States to
the receipt of certain benefits. In other words, because benefits may be denied
under Proposition 187 to individuals who are in fact lawfully present in the
United States if the administering agent merely reasonably suspects they are
      present  in violation of federal law, the verification procedure
conflicts with and impedes the objective of federal law with respect to
immigrant benefit eligibility.<p>
<p>
   Plaintiffs are correct. Because the only constitutional implementation of
Proposition 187's benefits denial provisions would require state agents to
utilize federal determinations of immigration status, and because a state
agent's "reasonable suspicion" of unlawful immigrant status is not the same as
a federal determination of immigration status, the "reasonably suspects"
language conflicts with federal law. It is therefore preempted under the third
De Canas test. The "reasonably suspects" language in subsection (c) may be
severed from the remainder of subsection (c).<p>
<p>
   The remaining verification provisions in sections 7 and 8 pertaining to the
denial of public education do not suffer from the same defect as their
counterparts in sections 5 and 6 because public school authorities are merely
required to verify a student's immigration status as lawful under federal law.
No "reasonable suspicions" are involved. Because verification of immigration
status by reference to INS information is permissible through programs such as
SAVE, the remaining verification provisions of sections 7 n24 and 8 are not in
conflict with federal law and are not preempted under the third De Canas test.

   b. Conflicts based on benefits denial provisions<p>
<p>
   As applied to federally-funded programs and federally-funded health care
facilities, the benefits denial provisions of sections 5 and 6, even if
implemented to deny benefits and services only to persons present in the United
States in violation of federal immigration laws, appear to conflict with
various federal laws. It is unclear, however, from the showing made here
whether, under  Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 435 U.S. 151, 158-160, 55 L. Ed.
2d 179, 98 S. Ct. 988 (1978), these apparent conflicts render the denial of
benefits provisions completely preempted or preempted only to the extent that
they apply to federally-funded benefits. Moreover, even if the Court were to
hold that the apparent conflicts with federal laws do not completely defeat the
denial of benefits provisions, the defendants have made only a general
representation to the Court that there are purely state-funded benefits and
services to which the initiative could apply. Because the implications of Ray
are unclear and because the Court is not convinced that there actually are any
such wholly state-funded benefits programs and health care facilities, the
Court declines to rule on whether the denial of benefits provisions are
preempted. Nevertheless the Court sees several apparent conflicts between the
operation of the benefits denial provisions and various federal laws.<p>
<p>
   (1) Section 5<p>
<p>
   The remaining benefits denial provision of section 5 provides that "any
public entity" shall not provide benefits or services to persons determined to
be "alien[s] in the United States in violation of federal law." @ 5(c)(1). By
its plain language, section 5 applies to "any public entity" in the state of
California and covers "public social services" or "benefits and
services"administered by those entities. Id. "Public social services" is
broadly defined under California law to include:  those activities and
functions of state and local government administered or supervised by the
department [of Social Services] or the State Department of Health Services and
involved in providing aid or services or both . . . to  those people of the
state who, because of their economic circumstances or social condition, are in
need thereof and may benefit thereby.<p>
<p>
Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code @ 10051. The Court concludes that section 5 broadly
denies any and all aid, services and programs administered or supervised by the
state departments of social and health services to persons without lawful
immigration status under federal law. Accordingly, to the extent that section 5
would deny public social services to persons entitled to receive them under
federal law, section 5 conflicts with federal law. Plaintiffs argue that
section 5's denial of public social services conflicts with federal law
regardless of whether eligibility is based on the impermissible underinclusive
classification scheme in subsection (b), or on federal immigration standards
referenced in subsection (c), because Proposition 187 conditions eligibility
for some federal-state cooperative programs on lawful immigration status where
the federal legislation authorizing such programs imposes no such requirements.
Specifically, plaintiffs contend that there is a conflict between section 5 and
the Women, Infants, and Children program n25 and child welfare services n26
because benefits are available under these federally-funded programs regardless
of immigration status.<p>

   The Women, Infants and Children program is a federally-funded program
administered by California through the Department of Health Services. Welf.
&amp; Inst. Code @ 15500 et seq. The federal statutes governing the program do
not  condition eligibility on lawful immigration status. See  42 U.S.C. @ 1786.
Defendants concede, as they must, that if the Women, Infants and Children
program is a "public social service" within the meaning of section 5,
conditioning eligibility for benefits under the program on lawful immigration
status conflicts with the federal law which makes those benefits available
regardless of immigration status. Given California's broad definition of
"public social service," section 5's denial of public social services clearly
applies to the Women, Infants and Children program. Therefore, section 5's
denial of social services as applied to the program conflicts with federal
law.<p>
<p>
   Qualified child welfare services programs administered by states receive
grants of federal funding under various federal laws. n27 Defendants do not
dispute that section 5 conflicts with these laws if construed to apply to
federally-funded child welfare programs for which federal law does not
condition eligibility on immigration status. Rather, defendants argue that
child welfare services are entirely outside the scope of section 5 as a matter
of statutory construction. Defendants contend that subsection 5(c)(1) applies
only to public social service programs to which persons voluntarily and
affirmatively apply. They argue that because child welfare services are
generally extended to children who are involuntarily placed in the protective
custody of the state and are not benefits for which a person voluntarily
applies, section 5 is inapplicable to child welfare services. This distinction
is specious. Section  5 applies broadly to deny "public social services" and
"benefits and services" to persons present in the United States in violation of
federal law. @ 5(c)(1). Child welfare services fall squarely within
California's definition of public social services. See Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.
Code @ 16500.<p>
<p>
   Moreover, some children do affirmatively seek state intervention (either<p>
personally or through a representative). Thus, defendants' construction of<p>
section 5 would deny benefits to children who actively seek placement with
child<p>
welfare services, while granting the same services to children who wait<p>
for the state to intervene. Because this absurd result could not have been<p>
contemplated by the voters and because child welfare services fall squarely<p>
within California's definition of public social services, child welfare
services<p>
are not excluded from section 5's coverage.<p>

   The question remains, however, whether the application of section 5 to child
welfare services conflicts with federal law. Plaintiffs identify several
federal provisions allocating money to and governing child welfare services n28
that are available to children regardless of immigration status. Section 5
conditions receipt of child welfare services on lawful immigration status.
Therefore, section 5, as applied to child welfare services, conflicts with
federal law.<p>

   Finally, section 5 may serve to deny state-administered public social
services that are not part of any federal-state cooperative program and do not
receive any federal funding. As noted above, the Court is unable to conclude
that such wholly state-funded programs in fact exist. n29 If such programs do
exist, it does not appear that section 5's denial of wholly state-funded
benefits would conflict with and be preempted by federal law. That the state's
denial of such benefits may be unconstitutional on other grounds is not a
question before the Court at this time.<p>

   In sum, section 5's benefits denial provisions conflict with federal law as
applied to public social services funded in any part by the federal government
and made available to persons under the authorizing federal statutes regardless
of immigration status. Section 5, to the extent that it denies benefits under
wholly state-funded programs and under federal-state cooperative programs such
as Medicaid, Food Stamps and AFDC, eligibility for which Congress has already
conditioned on lawful immigration status, does not appear to conflict with
federal law. The Court makes no determination, however, as to whether section
5's benefits denial provision is wholly preempted. A further showing would be
required to reach this conclusion.<p>

   Defendants respond that because the goal of section 6 is to prevent the use
of public funds to provide health care services to persons not lawfully in the
country, Hill-Burton and PHSA facilities are not prevented from providing all
services to unlawful immigrants but, rather, are merely denied public
reimbursement for the services so provided. Further, defendants contend that
emergency medical care required by EMTALA is explicitly excluded from the scope
of section 6.<p>
<p>
   (a) The Hill-Burton Act<p>
<p>
   The Hill-Burton Act, 42 U.S.C. @ 291 et seq., provides for allocation of
federal funds to states for the rehabilitation, construction or modernization
of public and nonprofit hospitals. See  42 U.S.C. @ 291c. In an application for
funds under the Act, the applicant state and institution must make assurances
that: <p>
<p>
(1) the facility or portion thereof to be constructed or modernized will be
made available to all persons residing in the territorial area of the
applicant; and (2) there will be made available in the facility or portion
thereof to be constructed or modernized a reasonable volume of services to
persons unable to pay therefor . . . . 42 U.S.C. @ 291c(e). The regulations
promulgated pursuant to the Act interpret the assurance that the facilities
will be made available to "all persons" to mean that services be provided  to
all persons residing . . . in the facility's service area, without
discrimination on the ground of race, color, national origin, creed or any
other ground unrelated to an individual's need for the service or the
availability of the needed service in the facility.<p>
<p>
42 C.F.R. @ 124.603(a)(1) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs argue that section 6
conflicts with federal law because it requires Hill-Burton facilities to deny
health services based on immigration status, a ground unrelated to the
individual's need or the availability of needed services. Plaintiffs contend
that section 6 must be read to prohibit the provision of all health services to
undocumented persons, even services to be self-paid by the patient or funded by
private charity, and therefore cannot be construed to avoid conflict with the
Hill-Burton Act.<p>
<p>
   Defendants argue that Hill-Burton facilities are not prohibited from
providing all services to undocumented persons but, rather, are merely
prohibited from providing publicly-funded services to such persons. In other
words, relying on language in the preamble of section 6 evidencing an intent to
deny "publicly-funded health care" to persons present in violation of federal
immigration laws, defendants argue that Hill-Burton facilities may provide
self-paid or charitable services to undocumented persons, and therefore no
conflict with federal law exists. See @ 6(a).<p>
<p>
   The plain language of subsection 6(c)(1) broadly prohibits "any
publicly-funded health care facility" n33 from providing "health care services"
or "services" other than emergency services required by federal law. @ 6(c)(1).
Despite the language in subsection 6(a) evidencing an intent to deny
undocumented  persons "the benefits of publicly-funded health care" and to
"protect public funds from misuse," subsection (c) contains no such limiting
language, and proscribes the provision of "services," generally, by
publicly-funded health care facilities to persons unlawfully present in the
United States. @@ 6(a), (c). Further, health care facilities do not, as a
practical matter, at the service provider level, make distinctions between
services that are "publicly-funded" and services that are funded by other
sources. It is difficult for the Court to conceive of a manner in which section
6 could operate under the construction urged by the defendants. The Court
thus<p>
<p>
declines to eschew the plain language of the statute in favor of defendant's<p>
interpretation. Section 6 must be construed to require publicly-funded health<p>
care facilities to deny all services other than emergency medical care
required<p>
by federal law. Because Hill-Burton facilities must make their services<p>
available to all persons without regard to immigration status, the operation
of<p>
section 6 conflicts with the requirements of the Hill-Burton Act.<p>

  n33 Subsection (d) of section 6 provides that the term "publicly-funded<p>
health care facility" is to be defined as specified in Sections 1200 and 1250

as:<p>

therapeuticservices to patients in the home as an incident to care provided at

<p>
   Even if section 6's denial of health care services is construed to apply
onlyto publicly-funded services, denying "free" services based on immigration
statusnevertheless conflicts with the Hill-Burton Act's requirement that
eachrecipient facility provide a "reasonable volume of services to persons
unable topay therefor," 42 U.S.C. @ 291c(e)(2), without discrimination based
onany ground "unrelated to an individual's need for the service or
theavailability of the needed service in the facility . . ." 42 C.F.R.
@124.603(a)(1). This does not mean that a Hill-Burton facility is required
totreat any person, regardless of his or her ability to pay, who appears at
thedoors simply because the person resides in the facility's area.
Rather,Hill-Burton facilities are required to provide a "reasonable volume of
services"to persons unable to pay without discriminating between these persons
on anybasis unrelated to patient need or service availability. That is,
Hill-Burtonfacilities may not close the door on a person based merely on
immigrationstatus. Section 6's denial of health care services, to the extent it
applies toHill-Burton facilities, conflicts with federal law.<p>

   (b) Public Health Service Act<p>
<p>
   Under the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. @ 201 et seq., grantsof
federal funds are available to public and nonprofit private entities
forprojects to plan and develop "community health centers" to serve
medicallyunderserved populations. 42 U.S.C. @ 254c(c). The Public Health
ServicesAct defines "community health center" as an entity which, "through its
staff . .. or through cooperative arrangements with other public or private
entities"provides health and health-related information and referral services
toresidents of the area it serves (the "catchment area"). 42 U.S.C. @254c(a).
The Act provides for grants of federal funds to community healthcenters serving
areas designated as having a shortage of personal healthservices. 42 U.S.C. @@
254c(c); 254(b)(3). Any hospital or otherfacility receiving grants under this
section for the purpose of serving amedically underserved population is a
"community health facility" within themeaning of the Public Health Services
Act. Community health centers funded undersection 254c(c) must be administered
to ensure that services are made availableand accessible in a manner "assuring
continuity of service to theresidents of the center's catchment area." 42
C.F.R. @ 51c.303(a).<p>
<p>
   Plaintiffs argue that section 6, which prohibits community health centers
from providing any services to catchment area residents in the United States
unlawfully, conflicts with and is preempted by the Act which requires such
facilities to make services available to catchment area residents regardless
ofthose persons' immigration status. Defendants respond that facilities
deemed"community health centers" by virtue of their receipt of federal funding
under the Act are only prohibited from providing publicly-funded health
services andmay provide self-paid or privately-funded services to undocumented
persons.However, because section 6 requires all "publicly-funded health care
facilities"to deny "health care services" and "services" other than emergency
medical services, and does not by its language limit such denial to services
for which reimbursements with public money are made, section 6 conflicts with
the PublicHealth Service Act provisions pertaining to federally-funded
community healthcenters.<p>

   (c) Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act<p>

   EMTALA, 42 U.S.C. @ 1395dd, requires hospitals underMedicare provider
agreements with the federal government to provide "anappropriate medical
screening examination" to "any individual" requestingmedical treatment from
hospital emergency departments regardless of the person'sability to pay. 42
U.S.C. @ 1395dd(a). The screening must include allroutinely available ancillary
services, and, if the patient is found to have an"emergency condition," the
hospital is required to provide the care necessary tostabilize the patient's
condition. 42 U.S.C. @ 1395dd(b). The hospital may not delay in providing a
screening or treatment required to stabilize anemergency condition in order to
inquire about an individual's insurance orability to pay for services. 42
U.S.C. @ 1395dd(h). <p>
<p>
   Plaintiffs contend that section 6 conflicts with EMTALA because it
precludeshealth care facilities from providing the required screening to
persons whose conditions do not appear to require "emergency medical care," the
only services exempted from section 6. @@ 6(a), 6(c). n34 Defendants argue that
subsections (a) and (c), by creating an exception for "emergency medical care
as required by federal law," exempt all of EMTALA's screening, stabilization
and treatment requirements and therefore do not conflict with federal law. Id.
Because the clear intent of the enacting body was to exempt "emergency medical
care as required by federal law," and it is reasonable to interpret this
exemption to include all of EMTALA's screening, stabilization and treatment

does not conflict with but, rather, is entirely consistent with, federal law

   In sum, section 6 must be construed to require all publicly-funded health
care facilities to deny all medical services, except emergency screening and
treatment procedures required by federal law, to persons not lawfully present
in the United States under federal law. To the extent that section 6 applies to
facilities that receive federal funding under programs such as the Hill-Burton
and Public Health Services Act and requires denial of non-emergency medical
services to persons unlawfully present where the federal legislation  enabling
the programs is silent with respect to the immigration status of medical care
recipients, section 6 conflicts with federal law. However, to the extent that
section 6 applies to wholly state-funded health care facilities, if in fact
such facilities exist n35, the denial of non-emergency health services to
persons unlawfully present in the United States does not appear to conflict
with any federal law. While recognizing these conflicts, the Court cannot
determine on the record before it whether section 6's denial of benefits

   (3) Section 7<p>
<p>
   Section 7 denies public elementary and secondary education to (i) children
who are in the United States in violation of federal law, and (ii) children
who are citizens or otherwise legally present, but whose parents or guardians
are in the United States unlawfully. See @@ 7(a), 7(e), 7(f). This denial of
public education directly conflicts with federal law as announced in the
Supreme Court's decision in  Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 72 L. Ed. 2d 786, 102
S. Ct. 2382 (1982). n36 In Plyler, the Supreme Court held that the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a state from denying
"to undocumented school-age children the free public education that it provides
to children who are citizens of the United States or legally admitted aliens."
Plyler, 457 U.S. at 205. The Supreme Court rejected each of the state's
proffered justifications for denying education to undocumented children,
including the desire "to protect itself from an influx of illegal immigrants,"
to "preserve . . . the state's limited resources for the education of its
lawful residents," and to remove the alleged "special burdens [undocumented
children] impose on the State's ability to provide high-quality public
education," as constitutionally insufficient to deny children access to a basic
education and noted the conflict that would result if the state were to deny
education to "a child enjoying an inchoate federal permission to remain." Id.
at 226-230. Clearly, then, section 7's denial of a public education based on
the immigration status of the child or the child's parent or guardian conflicts
with and is preempted by federal law as announced by the Supreme Court in
Plyler. n37<p>

   n36 Although plaintiffs did not assert Plyler as a basis for conflict
preemption of section 7 in their motions for summary judgment, the Court is
nevertheless constrained to consider the irreconcilable conflict between
section 7 and federal law as announced by the Supreme Court in that case. The
Ayala plaintiffs have also alleged that section 7 directly conflicts with the
Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. @ 1400 et seq. (the
"IDEA"), because the IDEA specifically guarantees a free appropriate public
education to all disabled children, regardless of immigration status. Since the
Court finds here that section 7 is preempted in its entirety as applied to all
children, this separate ground for summary judgment need not be considered.<p>
<p>
<p>
   n37 In finding the state's reasons for attempting to withhold public
education from undocumented children constitutionally "insubstantial," the
Supreme Court in Plyler was particularly concerned with the state statute
because it was directed at children, persons the Court deemed "special members"
of the "underclass" of undocumented aliens present in this country. Plyler, 457
U.S. at 219. Distinguishing undocumented children, who are capable of affecting
"'neither their parents' conduct nor their own status,'" from their adult
parents, who are willingly present in violation of federal immigration  laws,
the Court concluded that it is "difficult to conceive of a rational
justification for penalizing these children for their presence within the
United States." Id. at 219-220 (citing  Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U.S. 762, 770,
52 L. Ed. 2d 31, 97 S. Ct. 1459 (1977)). While "persuasive arguments support
the view that a State may withhold its beneficence from those whose very
presence within the United States is the product of their own unlawful
conduct," the "arguments do not apply with the same force to classifications
imposing disabilities on the minor children of such illegal entrants." Id.
Recognizing the costs the state statute imposed on "the innocent children who
[were] its victims, the Court concluded that the statute failed equal
protection scrutiny, despite the fact that classifications based on
undocumented alien status are not suspect and education is not a fundamental
right, because it failed to further "some substantial goal of the State." Id.
at 224. The Supreme Court's reasoning and ruling in Plyler appears to compel a
finding that section 6's denial of health care services, as applied to
undocumented children, is equally without "rational justification" and
offensive to the principles of equal protection. Id. at 220. Although the Court
declines at this time to rule on this extension of Plyler, it does note that
section 6, to the extent it denies health care services to undocumented
children, appears to be in direct conflict with federal law.<p>

IV. Conclusion<p>
<p>
     The California voters' overwhelming approval of Proposition 187 reflects
their justifiable frustration with the federal government's inability to
enforce the immigration laws effectively. No matter how serious the problem may
be, however, the authority to regulate immigration belongs exclusively to the
federal government and state agencies are not permitted to assume that
authority. The State is powerless to enact its own scheme to regulate
immigration or to devise immigration regulations which run parallel to or
purport to supplement the federal immigration laws.<p>

sections 4 through 9 of the initiative, taken together, constitute a regulatory
scheme (1) to detect persons present in California in violation of
state-created categories of lawful immigration status; (2) to notify state and
federal officials of their purportedly unlawful status; and (3) to effect their
removal from the United States. These provisions create an impermissible state
scheme to regulate immigration and are preempted under the first and second De
Canas tests. Plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment are granted with respect
to these provisions.<p>
<p>
   The benefits denial provisions of the initiative -- if implemented by state
regulations which would require verification of immigration status by reference
to federal determinations of status -- have only an incidental  impact on
immigration and thus do not violate the first De Canas test. Nor do those
provisions violate the second De Canas test. Plaintiffs have failed to direct
the Court to any authority for the proposition that Congress intended to
completely oust state authority to legislate in the area of benefits denial.
Consequently, the Court must conclude that those provisions are preempted only
if their operation conflicts with or impedes the objectives of federal laws.<p>
<p>
   Section 7's denial of primary and secondary education conflicts with federal
law as announced by the Supreme Court in Plyler v. Doe and is therefore
preempted. Section 8's denial of postsecondary education does not appear to
conflict with any federal law and thus is not preempted. With respect to the
benefits denial provisions in sections 5 and 6, to the extent that they deny
federally-funded benefits and services, those provisions conflict with federal
laws authorizing such benefits and services without reference to immigration
status. It is unclear from the showing made whether the existence of such
conflicts render sections 5 and 6 wholly preempted or preempted only to the
extent that they conflict with federal law. Moreover, the Court may not need to
reach that issue, for while it appears that the state could permissibly deny
wholly state-funded benefits and services without impeding the objectives of
federal law, it is unclear from the record whether any such purely state-funded
programs or health care facilities in fact exist. The showing made on these
motions is inadequate to permit the Court to resolve the issue of whether the
provisions are wholly preempted or whether they are preempted only to a limited
extent. For these reasons, plaintiffs' motions with respect to the denial of
benefits provisions in sections 5 and 6 are denied.<p>
<p>
   Finally, for the reasons set forth above, sections 2 and 3 are not
preempted. Plaintiffs' motions with respect to those sections are denied.<p>
<p>
   The preliminary injunction entered by the Court on December 14, 1994, shall
remain in effect until further order of the Court.<p>

<font size=+15>I NEED HELP!</font>
<IMG SRC="images/rules/linecolo.gif"><p>
I've got huge plans for this place, but nowhere near the time accomplish it all.<br>
</center>
<p>
I'd really love some <a href="mailto:scottyo@stoned.org">input</a> as to what people would like to see. But first let me give you some ideas as to where <i>I'd</i> 
like this site to go. I'd like to make <a href="index.html">Stoned.Org</a> <em>the</em> web site devoted to the joys of smoking, eating and otherwise ingesting marijuana. 
I figured that there are tons of sites commited to <a href="legalize.html">the legalization struggle</a>, <a href="hempedu.html">education about hemp</a>, and
<a href="commercial.html">commercial hemp products</a>, but I wanted to be about just plain getting stoned.
<p>
One of the things I'd like to do is develop the largest collection of ganja food recipes on the net. Look for the beginnings of that project soon. 
I'd love it if people would <a href="mailto:submissions@stoned.org">submit to me</a> any and all recipes they may have, along with any
comments about the preparation, and whether or not you'd like to be listed as the submitter.
<p>
Another project I'm working on is an online glass pipe museum/gallery. If you have a glass pipe and access to a scanner, then why not take a picture and send it to me?
Some suggestions, colored pipes will look best when photographed against a black background, and daylight is the best way to bring out the colors. You can 
<a href="mailto:submissions@stoned.org">send them to me</a>, but I may soon have an ftp upload directory for anonymous submissions. Either send the files as gifs or jpegs,
but I'll probobly compress them to jpeg for the pages. Again, please tell me whether or not you would like to be listed as the submitter.
<p> 
Finally, for now, I would like to offer free hosting for any related material in need of a home. If you have anything , anything at all , I'm willing to consider it.
Pictures, icons, cursors, waves and especially midi's will all be glady rewarded with a home for all to access and enjoy. Original web pages (comics, poems, art, etc...) having to anything to do 
with getting high (marijuana only !) will be happily placed in the <a href="index.html">stoned.org</a> domain.
I beg , please help me ! <a href="mailto:submissions@stoned.org">Send me stuff !</a>

<p>Hey a sure fire way to beat a UA besides drinking alot of cranberry juice is to
get some Fruti Pectin Inserto mix it up and drink it with alot of water about a
day before the test this should cover up any drugs in yer system. (they don't
get destroyed it just makes them undetectable)</p></font><br><br><br>

<h3>    Some chemicals will mask traces of drugs in urine.  Two products, Test
Free and Naturally Klean, claim to clear any drug testing for a few hours
after taking. The companies recommend abstaining for a day or two and
drinking lots of fluids.  Both companies claim to have FDA safe ingredients
although they are secretive about the formula.  You can contact the
companies at:<p>

    Naturally Clean herbal tea also claims to be an effective product in
defeating urine drug tests for pot and other drugs.  It is consumed shortly
before a test.  A sample can be obtained for a $20 shipping and handling
charge by calling 800/447-4692.</h3>

Cool Animated Cursors for Stoners</font>

<img src="images/rules/linecolo.gif">

<p>
<font face="arial" size="4">Finally!!&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the cursors in one package!!!</font>
</p>
</center>

<p class="ind">
<font face="arial" size="3">
Here at last is one file with all six cursors - two joints and four bongs - and in a self-
extracting executable. <a href="download/cursors.exe">Click here</a> to download the 32bit 
self extracting file and <a href="download/cursors.zip">here</a> for a standard zip file. 
When you download one of these you will get both Joint420.ani's and both Dabong!.ani's as 
well as GlassBong.ani and Haze.ani which is like one of those two chambered plastic bongs 
all the head shops sell.  If you have some but not all of these you can also get them 
individually below.
</font>
</p>

<center>
<p><font face="arial" size="4">Some Simple Instructions</font></p>
</center>

<font face="arial" size="3">
<p class="ind">
I get a lot of mail asking  how to make these work and being a Stoner I felt I should 
include some instructions here to save me some work in the long run.  First of all you 
need to be running a 32bit version of the <a href="http://microsoft.com/windows">Windows&reg;</a>
operating system. Animated cursors <strong>will not</strong> run on a Win3.1x machine and the 
same holds true for Macs I believe. So you Win95/NT users just follow these few instructions to
begin using these nifty cursors now.
</p>
<ul><ul>
<li>Open you Control Panel
<li>Open the Mouse Applet
<li>Click on the Pointers Tab
<li>Select the cursor you want to replace and click *browse*
<li>Navigate to the directory you unzipped to (usually c:\windows\cursors)
<li>Click *OK* a couple of times and you're set to go
</ul></ul>
<p class="ind">
And so you know, I created the Joint420.ani's with <a href="http://www.impactsoft.com/muangelo/muangelo.html">
Microangelo</a>, the coolest little shareware app for 95.  The animator alone is worth whatever it is they ask 
for it. And if you ever do any cool cursors for Stoners be sure to send em my way!!
</p>
</font>

<center>
<p><font face="arial" size="4">Individual Cursors</font></p>
</center>

<font face="arial" size="3">
<p class="ind">
And finally the collection of Cursors for Stoners as individual files. Most recently I
was sent this new cursor called The Haze, or Haze or something by <a href="mailto:hitman@citynet.net">
Hitman</a>. This cursor is like one of those two stage plastic things that head shops used to 
sell, or still do or whatever - it's been a while since I've been in one of those. Anyway, get it 
as a <a href="download/haze.exe">self extracting executable</a> or a <a href="download/haze.zip">
standard zip file</a>.
</p>

<p class="ind">
The first cursor I was ever sent was Dabong!.  A week later <a href="mailto:cnbdigital@flinet.com">
iZero</a>, a.k.a Image Zero, sent me Dabong2! with a note explaining that he forgot to fill the 
Dabong! with water! And I hadn't even noticed - talk about burnt. Get them both right here as a 
<a href="download/dabong2!.exe">self extractor</a> or a <a href="download/dabong2!.zip">zip</a>.
</p>

<p class="ind">
At some point in the last few months I was happy to get a glass bong in the mail!!  That's always 
cool. And I'm happy to have it for you right here, so it can go on making it's way through the 
mail.  Once again you're welcome to get it as an <a href="download/glassbong.exe">executable</a> 
or <a href="download/glassbong.zip">zip</a>. Send comments <a href="mailto:astrozom@lightspeed.net">
here</a>.
</p>

<p class="ind">
Now for my personal creations. The Joint420 cursors. Standard Disclaimer: I am not an artist 
by any means an artist so don't be surpised or disapointed if these are the worst cursors you've 
ever seen.  If you do happen to like them though, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:scottyo@stoned.org">
tell me</a>.  Grab the <a href="download/joint420.exe">self extracting executable here</a> and the <a href=
download/joint420.zip">standard zip file here</a>.
</p>

Here's the hemp 100 from last October in which I got my daughter's birthday mentioned. 
She does have a cool birthday - April 20th - or 4:20!!  She was born at 4:02 AM, almost a 
double 4:20. I thought of asking my wife to hold off for eighteen minutes, but seeing that 
she had been in labor for twenty-six hours already, I thought better of it.
<p>
Anyway, check out number 27.

                         MARIJUANA MYTHS
                          by Paul Hager
                   Chair, ICLU Drug Task Force

1. Marijuana causes brain damage

     The most celebrated study that claims to show brain damage is
the rhesus monkey study of Dr. Robert Heath, done in the late
1970s.  This study was reviewed by a distinguished panel of
scientists sponsored by the Institute of Medicine and the National
Academy of Sciences.  Their results were published under the title,
Marijuana and Health in 1982.  Heath's work was sharply criticized
for its insufficient sample size (only four monkeys), its failure
to control experimental bias, and the misidentification of normal
monkey brain structure as &quot;damaged&quot;.  Actual studies of human
populations of marijuana users have shown no evidence of brain
damage.  For example, two studies from 1977, published in the
Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) showed no
evidence of brain damage in heavy users of marijuana.  That same
year, the American Medical Association (AMA) officially came out in
favor of decriminalizing marijuana.  That's not the sort of thing
you'd expect if the AMA thought marijuana damaged the brain.

2. Marijuana damages the reproductive system

     This claim is based chiefly on the work of Dr. Gabriel Nahas,
who experimented with tissue (cells) isolated in petri dishes, and
the work of researchers who dosed animals with near-lethal amounts
of cannabinoids (i.e., the intoxicating part of marijuana).  Nahas'
generalizations from his petri dishes to human beings have been
rejected by the scientific community as being invalid.  In the case
of the animal experiments, the animals that survived their ordeal
returned to normal within 30 days of the end of the experiment. 
Studies of actual human populations have failed to demonstrate that
marijuana adversely affects the reproductive system.

3. Marijuana is a &quot;gateway&quot; drug -- it leads to hard drugs

     This is one of the more persistent myths.  A real world
example of what happens when marijuana is readily available can be
found in Holland.  The Dutch partially legalized marijuana in the
1970s.  Since then, hard drug use -- heroin and cocaine -- have
DECLINED substantially.  If marijuana really were a gateway drug,
one would have expected use of hard drugs to have gone up, not
down.  This apparent &quot;negative gateway&quot; effect has also been
observed in the United States.  Studies done in the early 1970s
showed a negative correlation between use of marijuana and use of
alcohol.  A 1993 Rand Corporation study that compared drug use in
states that had decriminalized marijuana versus those that had not,
found that where marijuana was more available -- the states that
had decriminalized -- hard drug abuse as measured by emergency room
episodes decreased.  In short, what science and actual experience
tell us is that marijuana tends to substitute for the much more
dangerous hard drugs like alcohol, cocaine, and heroin.


4. Marijuana suppresses the immune system

     Like the studies claiming to show damage to the reproductive
system, this myth is based on studies where animals were given
extremely high -- in many cases, near-lethal -- doses of
cannabinoids.  These results have never been duplicated in human
beings.  Interestingly, two studies done in 1978 and one done in
1988 showed that hashish and marijuana may have actually stimulated
the immune system in the people studied.

5. Marijuana is much more dangerous than tobacco

     Smoked marijuana contains about the same amount of carcinogens
as does an equivalent amount of tobacco.  It should be remembered,
however, that a heavy tobacco smoker consumes much more tobacco
than a heavy marijuana smoker consumes marijuana.  This is because
smoked tobacco, with a 90% addiction rate, is the most addictive of
all drugs while marijuana is less addictive than caffeine.  Two
other factors are important.  The first is that paraphernalia laws
directed against marijuana users make it difficult to smoke safely. 
These laws make water pipes and bongs, which filter some of the
carcinogens out of the smoke, illegal and, hence, unavailable.  The
second is that, if marijuana were legal, it would be more
economical to have cannabis drinks like bhang (a traditional drink
in the Middle East) or tea which are totally non-carcinogenic. 
This is in stark contrast with &quot;smokeless&quot; tobacco products like
snuff which can cause cancer of the mouth and throat.  When all of
these facts are taken together, it can be clearly seen that the
reverse is true: marijuana is much SAFER than tobacco.

6. Legal marijuana would cause carnage on the highways

     Although marijuana, when used to intoxication, does impair
performance in a manner similar to alcohol, actual studies of the
effect of marijuana on the automobile accident rate suggest that it
poses LESS of a hazard than alcohol.  When a random sample of fatal
accident victims was studied, it was initially found that marijuana
was associated with RELATIVELY as many accidents as alcohol.  In
other words, the number of accident victims intoxicated on
marijuana relative to the number of marijuana users in society gave
a ratio similar to that for accident victims intoxicated on alcohol
relative to the total number of alcohol users.  However, a closer
examination of the victims revealed that around 85% of the people
intoxicated on marijuana WERE ALSO INTOXICATED ON ALCOHOL.  For
people only intoxicated on marijuana, the rate was much lower than
for alcohol alone.  This finding has been supported by other
research using completely different methods.  For example, an
economic analysis of the effects of decriminalization on marijuana
usage found that states that had reduced penalties for marijuana
possession experienced a rise in marijuana use and a decline in
alcohol use with the result that fatal highway accidents decreased. 
This would suggest that, far from causing &quot;carnage&quot;, legal
marijuana might actually save lives.

7. Marijuana &quot;flattens&quot; human brainwaves

     This is an out-and-out lie perpetrated by the Partnership for
a Drug-Free America.  A few years ago, they ran a TV ad that
purported to show, first, a normal human brainwave, and second, a
flat brainwave from a 14-year-old &quot;on marijuana&quot;.  When researchers
called up the TV networks to complain about this commercial, the
Partnership had to pull it from the air.  It seems that the
Partnership faked the flat &quot;marijuana brainwave&quot;.  In reality,
marijuana has the effect of slightly INCREASING alpha wave
activity.  Alpha waves are associated with meditative and relaxed
states which are, in turn, often associated with human creativity.

8. Marijuana is more potent today than in the past

     This myth is the result of bad data.  The researchers who made
the claim of increased potency used as their baseline the THC
content of marijuana seized by police in the early 1970s.  Poor
storage of this marijuana in un-air conditioned evidence rooms
caused it to deteriorate and decline in potency before any chemical
assay was performed.  Contemporaneous, independent assays of
unseized &quot;street&quot; marijuana from the early 1970s showed a potency
equivalent to that of modern &quot;street&quot; marijuana.  Actually, the
most potent form of this drug that was generally available was sold
legally in the 1920s and 1930s by the pharmaceutical company
Smith-Klein under the name, &quot;American Cannabis&quot;.

9. Marijuana impairs short-term memory

     This is true but misleading.  Any impairment of short-term
memory disappears when one is no longer under the influence of
marijuana.  Often, the short-term memory effect is paired with a
reference to Dr. Heath's poor rhesus monkeys to imply that the
condition is permanent.

10. Marijuana lingers in the body like DDT

     This is also true but misleading.  Cannabinoids are fat
soluble as are innumerable nutrients and, yes, some poisons like
DDT.  For example, the essential nutrient, Vitamin A, is fat
soluble but one never hears people who favor marijuana prohibition
making this comparison.

11. There are over a thousand chemicals in marijuana smoke

     Again, true but misleading.  The 31 August 1990 issue of the
magazine Science notes that of the over 800 volatile chemicals
present in roasted COFFEE, only 21 have actually been tested on
animals and 16 of these cause cancer in rodents.  Yet, coffee
remains legal and is generally considered fairly safe.

12. No one has ever died of a marijuana overdose

     This is true.  It was put in to see if you are paying
attention.  Animal tests have revealed that extremely high doses of
cannabinoids are needed to have lethal effect.  This has led
scientists to conclude that the ratio of the amount of cannabinoids
necessary to get a person intoxicated (i.e., stoned) relative to
the amount necessary to kill them is 1 to 40,000.  In other words,
to overdose, you would have to consume 40,000 times as much
marijuana as you needed to get stoned.  In contrast, the ratio for
alcohol varies between 1 to 4 and 1 to 10.  It is easy to see how
upwards of 5000 people die from alcohol overdoses every year and no
one EVER dies of marijuana overdoses.

WHAT IS THE ICLU DRUG TASK FORCE?

     The Indiana Civil Liberties Union (ICLU) Drug Task Force is
involved in education and lobbying efforts directed toward
reforming drug policy.  Specifically, we support ACLU Policy
Statement number 210 which calls for the legalization of marijuana. 
We also support an end to the drug war.  In its place, we favor
&quot;harm reduction&quot; strategies which treat drug abuse as what it is --
a medical problem -- rather than a criminal justice problem.

     The Drug Task Force also works to end urine and hair testing
of workers by private industry.  These kinds of tests violate
worker privacy to no good purpose because they detect past use of
certain drugs (mostly marijuana) while ignoring others (e.g., LSD)
and cannot detect current impairment.  In situations where public
and worker safety is a legitimate concern, we advocate impairment
testing devices which reliably detect degradation of performance
without infringing upon worker privacy.

     For more information about the activities of the Drug Task
Force, call the ICLU at (317) 635-4059 or call Paul Hager at (812)
333-1384 or e-mail to hagerp@cs.indiana.edu on the InterNet.

enjoy them both, although I personally think that 420-11.ani is superior. 
Anyway, click to download <a href="download/Joint420.zip">Joint420.ZIP</a>.

The vaccine contains theattenuated strain <I>Salmonella typhi</I> Ty21a. Vivotif Berna&reg;Vaccine is manufactured by the Swiss Serum and Vaccine Institute. Thevaccine strain is grown under controlled conditions in mediumcontaining a digest of bovine tissues, an acid digest of casein,dextrose and galactose. The bacteria are collected by centrifugation,mixed with a stabilizer containing lactose and amino acids, andlyophilized. The lyophilized bacteria are filled into gelatincapsules which are coated with an organic solution to render themresistant to dissolution in stomach acid. The enteric-coated capsulesare then packaged in 4-capsule blisters for distribution. Thecontents of each enteric-coated capsule are shown in Table 1.</P><P><B>Table I .

This vaccine will not affordprotection against species of Salmonella other than <I>Salmonellatyphi</I> or other bacteria that cause enteric disease There areapproximately 500 cases of typhoid fever per year diagnosed in theUnited States (1). In 62% of these patients (statistics from1977-1979) the disease was acquired outside of the United Stateswhile in 38% of the patients the disease was acquired within theUnited States (2). Of the disease acquired during foreign travel 50%of the cases were contracted in Mexico, 20% in Asian countries and15% in India. The majority of the remaining cases were acquired inthe Caribbean basin, South and Central America, North Africa, andSouthern Europe (2). Typhoid fever is considered to be endemic inmost areas of Central and South America, North and Central Africa,Southeast Asia and the Indian Subcontinent (3). Of the diseaseacquired in the United States, 23% of the cases were associated withtyphoid carriers, 24% were due to food outbreaks, 23% were associatedwith the ingestion of contaminated food or water, 6% due to householdcontact with an infected person and 4% following exposure to <I>S.typhi</I> in a laboratory setting. The majority of typhoid casesrespond favorably to antibiotic therapy. However, the emergence ofchloramphenicol or ampicillin-resistant strains has greatlycomplicated therapy. Even with appropriate antibiotic therapy therewere 7 deaths among 901 acute typhoid cases reported in the UnitedStates from 1977-1979 2. Approximately 3-5% of acute typhoid casesresult in the development of a chronic carrier state (4). These nonsymptomatic carriers are the natural reservoir for <I>S. typhi</I>and can serve to maintain the disease in its endemic state or todirectly infect individuals (2). Eradication of the carrier state byantibiotic therapy has been unsuccessful.(5)</P><P>Virulent strains of <I>S. typhi</I> upon ingestion are able topass through the stomach acid barrier, colonize the intestinal tract,penetrate the lumen and enter the lymphatic system and blood stream,thereby causing disease. One possible mechanism by which disease maybe prevented is by evoking a local immune response in the intestinaltract . Such local immunity may be induced by oral ingestion of alive attenuated strain of <I>S. typhi</I> undergoing an abortedinfection.</P><P>The ability of <I>S. typhi</I> to cause disease and to induce aprotective immune response is dependent upon the bacteria possessinga complete lipopolysaccharide(6),(7). The <I>S. typhi</I> Ty21avaccine strain, by virtue of a reduction in enzymes essential forlipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, is restricted in its ability toproduce complete lipopolysaccharide (8),(9). However, a sufficientquantity of complete lipopolysaccharide is synthesized to evoke aprotective immune response. Despite low levels of lipopolysaccharidesynthesis, the cells lyse before regaining a virulent phenotype dueto the intracellular build-up of intermediates duringlipopolysaccharide synthesis (5),(8),(9).</P><P>The efficacy of the <I>S. typhi</I> Ty21a strain has beenevaluated in a series of double-blind field trials. The first trialwas performed in Alexandria, Egypt with a study population of 32,388children aged 6 to 7 years. Three doses of vaccine, in the form of afreshly reconstituted suspension administered after ingestion of 1 gof bicarbonate, were given on alternate days. Immunization resultedin a 95% decrease in the incidence of typhoid fever over a 3-yearperiod of surveillance (5),(10).</P><P>A series of field trials were subsequently performed in Santiago,Chile to evaluate efficacy when the vaccine strain was administeredin the form of an acid resistant enteric-coated capsule. The initialtrial involved 91,954 school-aged children, and compared 1 or 2 dosesof vaccine given one week apart. After 33 months of surveillancevaccine efficacy was 21% for the single dose schedule and 54% for the2-dose schedule.(11) A further field trial was performed in Santiago,Chile involving 109,594 school aged children.(12) Three doses ofenteric-coated capsules were administered either on alternate days(short immunization schedule) or 21 days apart (long immunizationschedule). Following 36 months of surveillance vaccination resultedin a 67% decrease in the incidence of typhoid fever in the shortimmunization schedule group and a 49% reduction in the longimmunization schedule group. After 48 months of surveillance, theshort immunization schedule resulted in a 68% decrease in typhoidfever.(13) An undiminished level of protection was observed duringthe fifth year of surveillance. A field trial was next conducted inSantiago, Chile to determine the relative efficacy of 2,3 and 4 dosesof enteric-coated vaccine administered on alternate days toschool-aged children. Relative vaccine efficacy as determined bycomparison of disease incidence within the three vaccinated groupswas highest for the four dose regimen. An additional trial held todetermine vaccine efficacy was conducted in Plaju, Indonesiainvolving 22,001 individuals approximately 3 to 50 years of age. Dueto logistical considerations three doses of enteric-coated capsuleswere administered at weekly intervals, a schedule known to providesuboptimal protection.(12) After two years of surveillance, vaccineefficacy for all age groups was 41%. It should be noted that vaccineefficacy was 36% for subjects 3 to 14 years of age and 60% for those15 to 44 years of age.</P><P>At present, the precise mechanism(s) by which Vivotif Berna&reg;Vaccine confers protection against typhoid fever is unknown. However,it is known that immunization of adult subjects can elicit a humoralanti-<I>S. typhi</I> LPS antibody response. Taking advantage of thisfact, the seroconversion rate was compared between adults living inan endemic area (Chile) and non-endemic areas (United States andSwitzerland) after the ingestion of 3 doses of vaccine. Comparableseroconversion rates were seen between these groups. Other studies inNorth American volunteers have shown that the Ty21a strain is capableof providing significant protection to an experimental challenge of<I>S. typhi</I>.</P><P>Because of the very low incidence of typhoid fever in UnitedStates citizens, efficacy studies are not currently feasible in thispopulation. However, the above observations support the expectationthat Vivotif Berna&reg; will provide protection to recipients fromnon-typhoid endemic areas such as the United States.</P><P><B>Indications and Usage Vivotif Berna&reg; </B><BR>Vaccine is indicated for immunization of adults and children greaterthan 6 years of age against disease caused by <I>Salmonellatyphi</I>. Results from clinical studies indicate that adults andchildren greater than 6 years of age may be protected against typhoidfever following the oral ingestion of 4 doses of Vivotif Berna&reg;Vaccine. Immunization (ingestion of all 4 doses of Vivotif Berna&reg;Vaccine) should be completed at least 1 week prior to potentialexposure to <I>S. typhi</I>.</P><P>Routine immunization against typhoid fever is not recommended inthe United States of America. Selective immunization against typhoidfever is recommended under the following circumstances 1) expectedintimate exposure to a house-hold contact with typhoid fever, 2)travelers to areas of the world with a risk of exposure to typhoidfever, and 3) workers in microbiology laboratories with expectedfrequent contact with <I>S. typhi</I>.(14)</P><P>Not all recipients of Vivotif Berna&reg; Vaccine will be fullyprotected against typhoid fever. Travelers should take all necessaryprecautions to avoid contact or ingestion of potentially contaminatedfood or water sources. There is no evidence to support the use oftyphoid vaccine to control common source outbreaks, disease followingnatural disasters or in persons attending rural summer camps.</P><P>Vivotif Berna&reg; Vaccine will not afford protection againstenteric microorganisms other than <I>S. typhi</I>. An optimal boosterdose has not yet been established. However, it is recommended that abooster dose consisting of 4 vaccine capsules taken on alternate daysbe given every 5 years under conditions of repeated or continuedexposure to typhoid fever (see Dosage and Administration section).</P><P>Typhoid fever continues to be an important disease in many partsof the world. Travelers entering such areas are at risk tocontracting typhoid fever following the ingestion of contaminatedfood or water. Parenterally administered typhoid vaccine has beenshown to be effective at reducing the incidence of disease in suchendemic areas. However, immunization with such vaccines is frequentlyaccompanied by adverse reactions such as pain and/or swelling at theinjection site, fever, malaise, and headache.</P><P><B>Contraindications</B><BR>Hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine or theenteric-coated capsule.</P><P>Safety of the vaccine has not been demonstrated in personsdeficient in their ability to mount a humoral or cell-mediated immuneresponse, due to either a congenital or acquired immunodeficientstate including treatment with immunosuppressive or antimitoticdrugs. The vaccine should not be administered to these personsregardless of benefits.</P><P><B>Warnings </B><BR>Vivotif Berna&reg; (Typhoid Vaccine Live Oral Ty21a) is not to betaken during an acute febrile illness or in the face of acutegastrointestinal illness. Postpone taking the vaccine if persistentdiarrhea or vomiting is occurring (see General Precautions).</P><P><B>Precautions</B><BR><B>General:</B> The vaccine should not be administered to personsduring an acute febrile illness or acute gastrointestinal illness.The vaccine should not be administered to individuals receivingsulfonamides and antibiotics since these agents may be active againstthe vaccine strain and prevent a sufficient degree of multiplicationto occur in order to induce a protective immune response. The vaccineshould not be administered to persons with a known hypersensitivityto any vaccine component or medium component (see Description ).</P><P><B>Information for Patients:</B> It is essential that all 4 dosesof vaccine be taken at the prescribed alternate day interval toobtain a maximal protective immune response. Vaccine potency isdependent upon storage under refrigeration (between 2&#176;C and8&#176;C [35.6&#176;F - 46.4&#176;F]). The vaccine should be storedunder refrigeration at all times. It is essential to replace unusedvaccine in the refrigerator between doses. The vaccine capsule shouldbe swallowed approximately one hour before a meal with a cold orlukewarm (temperature not to exceed body temperature. eg, 37&#176;C[98.6&#176;F] ) drink. Care should be taken not to chew the vaccinecapsule. The vaccine capsule should be swallowed as soon afterplacing in the mouth as possible.</P><P><B>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</B>Long-term studies in animals with Vivotif Berna&reg; Vaccine havenot been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenicpotential or impairment of fertility.</P><P><B>Pregnancy</B></P><P><B>Category C</B><BR>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with VivotifBerna&reg; Vaccine. It is not known whether Vivotif Berna&reg;Vaccine can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women orcan affect reproduction capacity. Vivotif Berna&reg; Vaccine shouldbe given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</P><P><B>Nursing Mothers</B><BR>There is no data to warrant the use of this product in nursingmothers. It is not known if Vivotif Berna&reg; Vaccine is excreted inhuman milk.</P><P><B>Pediatric Use</B><BR>The safety and efficacy of Vivotif Berna&reg; Vaccine has not beenestablished in children under 6 years of age. This product istherefore not recommended for use in children under 6 years of age.</P><P><B>Adverse Reactions</B><BR>Several lots of Vivotif Berna&reg; Vaccine have been evaluated inseveral field trials both in adults and in school-aged children.Objectively monitored side effects, e.g., abdominal pain, diarrhea,vomiting, fever, headache and skin rash, did not occur at astatistically higher frequency in the vaccinated group as compared toa placebo group.(11) Post marketing surveillance outside of theUnited States has found that side effects are infrequent, transient,and resolve of their own accord. Reported adverse reactions includenausea, abdominal cramps, vomiting, skin rash or urticaria on thetrunk and/or extremities.</P><P><B>Overdosage </B><BR>Five to 8 doses of Vivotif Berna&reg; Vaccine containing between 3-10x 10(12) viable vaccine organisms were administered to 155 healthyadult males. This dosage was, at a minimum, 5-fold higher than thecurrently recommended dose. No significant reactions, e.g., vomiting,acute abdominal distress or fever, were observed. At the recommendeddosage, the<I> S. typhi </I>Ty21a vaccine strain is not excreted inthe feces. However, clinical studies in volunteers have shown thatoverdosing can increase the possibility of shedding the <I>S.typhi</I> Ty21a vaccine strain in the feces.(15)</P><P><B>Dosage and Administration</B><BR>The blister containing the vaccine capsules should be inspected toensure that the foil seal and capsules are intact.</P><P>One capsule is to be swallowed approximately 1 hour before a mealwith a cold or lukewarm (temperature not to exceed body temperature,e.g., 37&#176;C [98.6&#176;F] ) drink on alternate days, e.g., days1, 3, 5 and 7. The vaccine capsule should not be chewed and should beswallowed as soon after placing in the mouth as possible. A completeimmunization schedule is the ingestion of 4 vaccine capsules asdescribed above. Unless a complete immunization schedule is followed,an optimum immune response may not be achieved. Not all recipients ofVivotif Berna&reg; Vaccine will be fully protected against typhoidfever. Travelers should take all necessary precautions to avoidcontact or ingestion of potentially contaminated food or water.</P><P><B>Booster Use </B><BR>The optimum booster schedule for Vivotif Berna&reg; has not beendetermined. Efficacy has been shown to persist for at least 5 years.Further, there is no experience with Vivotif Berna&reg; Vaccine as abooster in persons previously immunized with parenteral typhoidvaccine. Despite these limitations it is recommended that boosterdose consisting of four vaccine capsules taken on alternate days begiven every 5 years under conditions of repeated or continuedexposure to typhoid fever.</P><P><B>How Supplied </B><BR>A single foil blister contains 4 doses of vaccine in a singlepackage.</P><P><B>Storage</B><BR>Vivotif Berna&reg; Vaccine is not stable when exposed to ambienttemperatures, Vivotif Berna&reg; Vaccine should therefore be shippedand stored between 2&#176;C and 8&#176;C (35.6-46.4&#176;F). Eachpackage of vaccine shows an expiration date. This expiration date isvalid only if the product has been maintained at 2&#176;C 8&#176;C(35.6-46.4&#176;F). Vivotif Berna&reg; Vaccine is manufactured bySwiss Serum and Vaccine Institute, Berne, Switzerland, anddistributed by Berna Products, Corp., Coral Gables, FL 33134.</P><P><B>References</B><BR>(1).

The CDC recommends that<B>all international travelers be advised not to transport any fooditems from cholera-infected areas-regardless of its form orpreparation!</B></P><H4>The BIGGER risk-International Travel</H4><P>During 1994, 384,000 cases were officially reported to the WorldHealth Organization. Overall, 94 countries reported cholera casesincluding 13 countries in Central and South America, India, SoutheastAsia, Africa and individual republics of the former Soviet Union.</P><P>Admittedly, international travel in countries where cholera iswidespread is responsible for most cases of cholera seen in NorthAmerica and Western Europe. In 1995, an unconfirmed number oftravelers from the U.S., Holland, Spain and Switzerland, as well asover 200 Japanese tourists returned home from the Indonesian islandof Bali, infected with cholera.</P><P>Although vaccines against cholera have been available for years,they have not proven to be effective and are therefore notrecommended by the WHO. In response to this worldwide need, a neworal cholera vaccine has been developed by the<A HREF="09_aboutberna.html">Swiss Serum and Vaccine Institute Berne,the parent company of BERNA PRODUCTS, CORP</A>, and the Center forVaccine Development of the University of Maryland School of Medicine.</P><P>Identified as " V cholerae CVD 103-HgR", it is the firstgenetically engineered, live but weakened vaccine licensed for humanuse. Another benefit is the fact that it is <B>orallyadministered.</B></P><P>Switzerland has been the first country to approve CVD 103 HgR in1994. It is also available under a special release procedure from thegovernments in several European markets, including Italy, Austria andthe United Kingdom. Approximately 10,000 doses have been used underthese special procedures. A license application for this vaccine hasbeen submitted to the Canadian Bureau of Biologics and a similarsubmission to the U.S. FDA it planned in the near future.</P><P>Until widespread availability of the CVD I03-HgR vaccine, the onlydefense against cholera is to avoid exposure. <B>The CDC recommendsthat all international travelers be reminded of the followingprecautions:</B></P><UL>   <LI>only drink water that is commercially bottled, boiled or   treated      <LI>avoid ice unless positive it has been made from sanitary water      <LI>eat only foods that are thoroughly cooked and are still hot      <LI>eat fruit only if it has been peeled by the person consuming   it      <LI>avoid undercooked or raw fish or shellfish-including cerviche      <LI>only eat vegetables that have been cooked      <LI>avoid all salads and leafy vegetables      <LI>avoid all food and beverages from street vendors</UL><P><I>Sources: MMWR, Vol 44 No 20, May 26, 1995.

But for physicians involved with travel medicine, aneffective cholera vaccine is near the top of their list. As reportedin a recent article in Infectious Disease News The<A HREF="09_aboutberna.html">Swiss Serum &amp; Vaccine InstituteBerne, the parent company of BERNA PRODUCTS, CORP</A>., is working tofill this wish.</P><P><B>An Unwelcome Hitchhiker into the Country</B></P><P>Since January 1991, a cholera epidemic has spread throughout theWestern Hemisphere. According to a report in the medical journalMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR 1993; 42 :89-93), in 2short years, 3/4 million cases of cholera had been reported, withover 6000 deaths. Unexpectedly, the United States is one of the 21countries seeing cases of cholera.</P><P>During 1992, 12 states reported cases of cholera to the CDC, withno apparent regional pattern.</P><P><B>Cholera in the U.S.</B><BR>Arizona<BR>Maryland<BR>California<BR>Nevada<BR>Connecticut<BR>New Jersey<BR>Florida<BR>New York<BR>Hawaii<BR>Texas<BR>Louisiana<BR>Washington</P><P>In total, 102 cases were reported, more than in any other yearsince the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta begansurveillance 30 years ago in 1961. Interestingly, <I>Vibriocholerae</I>, the bacteria that causes cholera, has taken severaldifferent routes into the country.</P><P>While airline food is never considered to be very good, in thecase of one international flight it turned out to be the cause of thelargest single outbreak in 1992. On an Aerolineas Argentinas flightbetween Buenos Aires and Los Angeles, food contaminated with thebacteria was catered on-board during a stopover resulting in 75 ofthe reported cases.</P><P>A most interesting type of "souvenir" was identified as anothercarrier for <I>Vibrio cholerae</I> bacteria. In 1991, almost half ofthe cases reported that year were traced to souvenir crabs found inthe suitcases of travelers to Latin America. (MMWR 1991;40:287-9)</P><P><B>&nbsp;</B></P><P><B>But according to CDC reports,</B></P><P>traveling is not the only way Americans can get cholera. Since1973, 91 cases of cholera <B>not related to international travel</B>have been reported. Most of these U.S.-acquired cases were eventuallytraced to raw or undercooked seafood. And not necessarily<B>imported</B> seafood either. (Infectious Disease News, April 1993)</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>In 1992, routine sampling isolated <I>V. cholerae</I> bacteriafrom oyster beds in Gulf Coast waters. Food and Drug Administration(FDA) investigation uncovered the dangerous "stowaway" aboard cargoships from Latin America. Prior to docking in Gulf Coast ports, theseships had been in countries where Cholera was rampant, resulting incontamination of ballast and holding tanks. As a result, the FDA,Coast Guard and coastal Public Health Departments have beenmonitoring even more closely the "cargo" these ships bring into U.S.ports. (Infectious Disease News, September 1992)</P><P><B>&nbsp;</B></P><P><B>One Step Closer to an Effective Vaccine.</B></P><P>With the CDC predicting that the spread of cholera outside ofLatin America into the Caribbean region is "probable", the importanceof an effective vaccine continues to grow. An article in the April1993 issue of Infectious Disease News focused attention on the newcholera vaccine, CVD 103-HgR, being developed by The Swiss Serum&amp; Vaccine Institute Berne and the Center for Vaccine Developmentof the University of Maryland School of Medicine. CVD 103-HgR is thefirst genetically engineered "weakened" vaccine. The fact that it is<B>orally </B>administered is considered particularly good by expertssince they consider this the best way to stimulate the body toproduce immunity against disease that affect the gastrointestinaltract.</P><P><B>&nbsp;</B></P><P><B>Approval Standards Change as a Result of SS &amp; VIB Vaccine</B></P><P>In fact, the results demonstrated by CVD 103-HgR have actuallychanged the policy used toevaluate cholera vaccines. Reviewing thedata for CVD 103 HgR, the FDA's Vaccine and Related BiologicalProducts Advisory Committee concluded that challenge studies ( ie,when volunteers are vaccinated and then exposed to the bacteria tosee if they develop the disease) rather than field trials (ie. Whenvolunteers in a country where the disease is occuring are vaccinatedand then checked to see if they are protected from the disease) couldbe used to show a cholera vaccine works for travelers.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>As reported in the "Pink Sheet", the FDA's official reportingpublication, "The committee's conclusion that challenge studies wouldbe sufficient was contingent upon the efficacy data from challengestudies for a hypothetical cholera vaccine being at least as good asthe data presented to the committee on the Swiss Serum and VaccineInstitute's CVD 103-HgR vaccine." (FDC Reports, Feb. 1, 1993)</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Sources: MMWR 1993: 42: 89 93, MMWR 1992 40:562-S, InfectiousDisease News, Sept 1992. Infectious Disease News, April 1993,FDCReports, Feb 1, 1993)</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><A HREF="#prod">Back to Berna Product List</A></P><P><HR></P><H2><A NAME="anchor42428"></A>Epidemic moving up and down the U.S.East Coast:<BR>Clinical trials on new rabies vaccine</H2><P>Clinical trials to judge efficacy were conducted for a new rabiesvaccine developed by the <A HREF="09_aboutberna.html">Swiss Serum&amp; Vaccine Institute Berne</A>. Trials of the vaccine, known asLYSSAVAC BERNA HDC, were done at the Veterinary Schools at KansasState University, University of Oklahoma and University of Georgiaunder Investigational New Drug status. Early trials confirming thevaccine's safety and efficacy for prevention (pre-exposure) as wellas treatment (post exposure treatment of individuals bitten by rabidanimals) were conducted in Europe and the Far East.</P><P><B>&nbsp;</B></P><P><B>Not So Healthy Neighbors</B></P><P>Once approved, the vaccine will be welcomed by Primary Carephysicians and Infectious Disease specialists alike. Since 1990, anepidemic of animal rabies has been spreading up and down the eastcoast of the U.S. "<B>Rabies is becoming a greater public healthconcern because rabid raccoons are moving into more densely populatedareas</B>," explained Iyorlumun Uhaa, DVM, PhD, epidemiologist withthe viral and rickettsial zoonoses branch, Centers for DiseaseControl (CDC).</P><P>Yes, he did say, "<B>raccoons</B>." While most people associatetransmission of rabies with bats, in fact, raccoons have recentlysurpassed bats as the prime carrier of the disease. And that's theproblem: Unlike bats, raccoons frequently roam through residentialneighborhoods, getting in fights with pet dogs. Exposure to rabies inthe general population is most often the result of people trying tobreak up these fights. While not necessarily bitten, saliva from therabid animal gets on hands or arms at the same time as cutsresulting, in a risk of infection.</P><P>The significance of this problem is demonstrated by statisticsfrom the state of New York. According to the Infectious Disease Newsreport, prior to the increase in rabid raccoons in the state, lessthan 100 people per year sought treatment as compared to <B>over800</B> the next year.</P><P><B>The Treatment Dilemma</B></P><P>Contrary to the common perception, exposure to the rabies virus,even with a puncture wound from a rabid animal, does not necessarilyresult in infection. Thus, the decision to start the multiple shottreatment is a difficult one. Delaying treatment until symptomsappear is not an alternative--because once symptoms appear, it's toolate. The death rate is 100%, even with treatment.</P><P>Further complicating the decision of whether or not to start thetreatment shots is the fact that when symptoms might appear isunpredictable. Because the rabies virus spreads through nerve rootsrather than the bloodstream, symptoms can appear as quickly as 2weeks after exposure or not for many months afterwards.</P><P><B>Who is at Risk?</B></P><P>Certain groups, such as veterinarians, wildlife and animalcontrol, and zookeepers are the most obvious risk groups. Spelunkers(people who explore caves as a hobby) are included as well due to therisk of contact with bats or wild animals. The CDC recommendspreventive vaccination for these at-risk individuals.</P><P>However, somewhat less commonly recognized is the <B>risk to theinternational traveler. </B>While vaccination against rabies is not arequirement for entry into any country of the world, travelers shouldbe aware of those areas where they might be at <B>increased risk forexposure to rabies.</B></P><P>The 1992 edition of the CDC's HEALTH INFORMATION FOR INTERNATIONALTRAVEL states "...the risk of rabies is highest in areas of the worldwhere dog rabies remain highly endemic, including (but not limitedto) parts of <B>Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Colombia,Ecuador, India, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam.</B>The disease is also found in dogs in most of the other countriesof <B>Africa, Asia, Central and South America" </B>with minorexceptions.</P><P><B>It recommends that a bite from any animal, not just a dog,needs evaluation. Prompt local cleansing of the wound with safe waterand generous amounts of soap can help reduce risk. Local healthauthorities should be notified, as well as a personal physician orState Department officials.</B></P><P>Sources: Infectious Disease News April 1992; CDC HEALTHINFORMATION FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL 1992</P><P><A HREF="#prod">Back to Berna Product List</A></P><P><HR></P><H2><A NAME="anchor792269"></A>What do travelers, women and olderpatients have in common?</H2><P>The answer: Individuals in these groups have been identified asbeing at "higher risk" for contracting tetanus since they are morelikely to lack protective antibodies.</P><P>At risk for tetanus? As surprising as it may seem since thepreventative vaccine,<A HREF="09_aboutberna.html#anchor836484">tetanus toxoid</A>, hasbeen available since the mid 1940's, cases of tetanus continue toappear. 117 cases from 34 states were reported during the period from1989-1990. However, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlantabelieves this does not reflect the true extent of the problem. Theirreport* concludes "Because tetanus surveillance findings are basedonly on reported cases, these results are likely to underestimate the'true' tetanus incidence in the United States. Completeness ofreporting for tetanus mortality has been estimated at 40% whilecompleteness of reporting for tetanus morbidity may be even lower."</P><P><B>1 out of 4 Patients Die.</B></P><P>Tetanus is not a disease to be taken lightly. While it is bothpreventable and treatable, still 24% of the patients reported to theCDC with tetanus died. Furthermore, the death rate clearly increasedwith age. No deaths were reported in patients under the age of 40 ascompared with 17% of patients 40-49 years old and 50% of those 80years or older.</P><P>The CDC report also underscored the significant economic impactthis disease can have. Length of hospitalization required ranged from2 131 days. In addition, specialized care in the form of assistedventilation was necessary for almost half of the patients</P><P><B>An Ounce of Prevention</B></P><P>Or in this case 1 /60th of an ounce of vaccine booster every 10years provides effective protection. However, a sizable portion ofthe U.S. Adult population are not up to-date with boostervaccinations, particularly older adults. In fact, blood test surveyshave shown that between 31-71 % of older adults lack protectivelevels of tetanus antibodies. A 1989 National Health Interview Surveyfound that only 13% of persons over 65 years reported receiving atetanus booster vaccination in the previous 5 years. This compares to50% that would be expected to have received a booster during thattime period for a vaccine that is routinely recommended every 10years.</P><P>However, routine booster vaccinations for tetanus are frequentlydismissed under the assumption that if and when a patient is injured,the protective vaccines (tetanus toxoid and tetanus immune globulin)will be given.</P><P>The problem is that tetanus infection often result from wounds,frequently wood splinters, that aren't considered sufficiently severeby the patient to warrant seeking medical attention. As confirmationof this, the CDC points out that 2 out of 3 patients included in theSurveillance Report didn't bother to seek medical attention at thetime of the injury that resulted in tetanus. And this scenariooccurred in the U.S. where medical attention is easily and readilyavailable. If a patient is injured while traveling overseas,particularly in developing countries, adequate medical attentionmight not even be available.</P><P><B>A Mid-Decade Reminder</B></P><P>Unlike during childhood where vaccinations are a key medicalpriority, the vaccination status of adults is often overlooked. TheCDC report reminds that vaccination status needs to be a routine partof the adult medical profile, particularly for elderly patients.Using mid-decade ages (e.g., 35, 45, 55, 65, etc.) may be an easybench mark to ensure that adult patients are protected.</P><P>* MMWR Surveillance Report, 41/SS-8.

In developing and producingan effective and stable smallpox vaccine, The Swiss Serum and VaccineInstitute (SS &amp; VIB) contributed significantly to this proudachievement of preventative medicine</P><H2>Berna Products, Corp.</H2><P>is the North American subsidiary of The Swiss Serum and VaccineInstitute Berne (SS &amp; VIB). As one of 3 SS &amp; VIB subsidiarieslocated around the world, it was established to provide immediateaccess to SS &amp; VIB vaccines and biologicals for health careprofessionals in the US and Canada. Together with the manufacturingfacilities in Switzerland, Italy and Spain and the world-wide networkof Regional Offices located in Latin America and in the Near, Middleand Far East.</P><P><B>The Swiss Serum and Vaccine Institute Berne</B> enjoys a globalreputation as one of the <B>leading European manufacturers ofbiologics</B></P><H2>Berna Worldwide</H2><P>Regardless of the language spoken, the name BERNA is a familiarone to physicians the world over.<BR><B>BERNA PRODUCTS</B> is the trademark by which the products of theSwiss Serum and Vaccine Institute Berne are known in 120 countriesaround the world. In addition, BERNA vaccines have been supplied tomore than 40 developing countries as a part of the WHO/UNICEFsponsored Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI).</P><P>The distribution of BERNA vaccines on a worldwide basisnecessitates a level of expertise beyond that required forpharmaceutical products in general. For example, due to the limitedshelf-life of vaccines, it is essential the the "cold chain" of doorto door refrigeration be insured, BERNA PRODUCTS are deliveredthroughout the US and Canada exclusively by Federal Express&amp;reg.Not only does Federal Express&#174 quality service maintain thiscold-chain guarantee, but it makes it possible to constantly trackeach shipment until it is delivered to into the hands of the healthprofessional.</P><P>And other example of the specialized expertise of the BERNAnetwork is the vast language requirements of labeling anddistribution for global distribution. While any pharmaceuticalproduct must obviously be prepared with the proper language labeling,frequently <A HREF="#anchor311616">BERNA vaccines</A> are neededunder emergency situations. To meet these needs, an in-house printingdepartment guarantees rapid, high quality packaging and labeling ofits products. The capability exists so that in emergencies, more than500,000 doses of vaccine can be packaged, labeled and shipped within48 hours regardless of whether the labeling must be in Chinese,Arabic or any other language.</P><H2><A NAME="anchor311616"></A><I>Berna Products</I> Product Line</H2><P>Swiss Serum and Vaccine Institute specializes in the production ofvaccines and biologic products for both adult and pediatric use.

Typhoidimmunization is not a legal requirement for entry into any countryand no certificate of vaccination is necessary.</P><P>Travelers who are taking H2 Antagonists (such as Tagamet&#174,Zantac&#174, Pepsid&#174, etc.) are also at a higher risk forTyphoid Fever as they have less gastric acid which works to destroybacteria in the stomach.</P><H3><A NAME="anchor572783"></A>ORAL Typhoid Vaccine</H3><P>Typhoid Vaccine Live Oral Ty21a is the first and only oral vaccinefor typhoid fever protection.

To date, over 150 million dosestaken worldwide.</P><P>The introduction of VIVOTIF BERNA&#174 in the United States in 1990 wasa joint effort between The Swiss Serum and Vaccine Institute Berneand the US Military who helped to fund the field trials necessary forFDA approval. Following its approval, in 1991 the Armed ForcesEpidemiology Board (the Defense Department's medical advisory panel)recommended that all troops going overseas be given the oral vaccine.Since then, over 100 million doses of VIVOTIF BERNA&#174 oraltyphoid vaccine have been taken in the United States.</P><H4><B>"Vaccination"</B></H4><P>Vaccination" consists of 4 capsules and should be completed 1 weekprior to potential exposure.</P><P>The schedule is simple, one (1 ) capsule is taken every other dayon an empty stomach (ie. 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating). Manypeople find that it's easiest to take the capsule at bedtime.</P><P>Protection from typhoid fever lasts 5 years.

Overall, 94 countries reported cholera casesincluding 13 countries in Central and South America, India, SoutheastAsia, Africa and individual republics of the former Soviet Union.On apositive note, the 0139 strain identified in India in 1992 has notspread beyond South Asia and is now considered by the WHO "lesslikely to become a global threat."</P><P>Admittedly, international travel in endemic countries isresponsible for most cases of cholera seen in North America andWestern Europe. In 1995, an unconfirmed number of travelers from theU.S., Holland, Spain and Switzerland, as well as over 200 Japanesetourists returned home from the Indonesian island of Bali, infectedwith cholera.</P><P>Although vaccines against cholera have been available for years,they have not proven to be effective and are therefore notrecommended by the WHO. In response to this worldwide need, a neworal cholera vaccine has been developed by the<A HREF="09_aboutberna.html">Swiss Serum and Vaccine Institute Berne,the parent company of BERNA PRODUCTS, CORP</A>, and the Center forVaccine Development of the University of Maryland School of Medicine.</P><P><I>V. cholerae </I>CVD 103-HgR is the first geneticallyengineered, live attenuated vaccine licensed for human use. The factthat it is orally administered is considered particularlyadvantageous by experts since (1) they consider this both the bestroute to stimulate intestinal immunity and (2) essential to providingoptimal protection against enteric diseases.</P><P>While Switzerland has been the first country to approve CVD 103HgR in 1994, it is available under a named patet status in severalEuropean markets, including Italy, Austria and the United Kingdom.Approximately 10,000 doses have been used under protocol.

According to a report in Morbidity and MortalityWeekly Report (MMWR 1993; 42 :89-93), in 2 short years, 3/4 millioncases of cholera had been reported, with over 6000 deaths.Unexpectedly, the United States is one of the 21 countries seeingcases of cholera.</P><P>During 1992, 12 states reported cases of cholera to the CDC, withno apparent regional pattern.</P><P><B>Cholera in the U.S.</B><BR>Arizona<BR>Maryland<BR>California<BR>Nevada<BR>Connecticut<BR>New Jersey<BR>Florida<BR>New York<BR>Hawaii<BR>Texas<BR>Louisiana<BR>Washington</P><P>In total, 102 cases were reported, more than in any other yearsince the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta begansurveillance 30 years ago in 1961. Interestingly, <I>Vibriocholerae</I> has taken several different routes into the country.</P><P>While airline food is never considered to be very good, in thecase of one international flight it turned out to be the cause of thelargest single outbreak in 1992. On an Aerolineas Argentinas flightbetween Buenos Aires and Los Angeles, contaminated food was cateredon-board during a stopover resulting in 75 of the reported cases.</P><P>A most interesting type of "souvenir" was identified as anotherconduit for <I>Vibrio cholerae</I>. In 1991, almost half of the casesreported that year were traced to souvenir crabs found in thesuitcases of travelers to Latin America. (MMWR 1991;40:287-9)</P><P>But according to CDC reports, traveling is not the only wayAmericans can get cholera. Since 1973, 91 cases of cholera <B>notrelated to international travel</B> have been reported. Most of theseU.S.-acquired cases were eventually traced to raw or undercookedseafood. And not necessarily <B>imported</B> seafood either.(Infectious Disease News, April 1993)</P><P>In 1992, routine sampling isolated <I>V. cholerae</I> bacteriafrom oyster beds in Gulf Coast waters. FDA investigation uncoveredthe dangerous "stowaway" aboard cargo ships from Latin America. Priorto docking in Gulf Coast ports, these ships had been in endemiccountries, resulting in contamination of ballast and holding tanks.As a result, the FDA, Coast Guard and coastal Public HealthDepartments have been monitoring even more closely the "cargo" theseships bring into U.S. ports. (Infectious Disease News, September1992)</P><P><B>One Step Closer to an Effective Vaccine</B><BR>With the CDC predicting that the spread of cholera outside of LatinAmerica into the Caribbean region is "probable", the importance of aneffective vaccine continues to grow. An article in the April 1993issue of Infectious Disease News focused attention on the new choleravaccine, CVD 103-HgR, being developed by The Swiss Serum &amp;Vaccine Institute Berne and the Center for Vaccine Development of theUniversity of Maryland School of Medicine. CVD 103-HgR is the firstgenetically engineered "weakened" vaccine. The fact that it is<B>orally </B>administered is considered particularly good by expertssince they consider this the best way to stimulate the body toproduce immunity against disease that affect the gastrointestinaltract.</P><P><B>Approval Standards Change as a Result of SS &amp; VIB Vaccine</B><BR>In fact, the results demonstrated by CVD 103-HgR have actuallychanged the policy used to evaluate cholera vaccines. Reviewing thedata for CVD 103 HgR, the FDA's Vaccine and Related BiologicalProducts Advisory Committee concluded that challenge studies ratherthan field trials could be used to show a cholera vaccine works fortravelers.</P><P>As reported in the Pink Sheet, "The committee's conclusion thatchallenge studies would be sufficient was contingent upon theefficacy data from challenge studies for a hypothetical choleravaccine being at least as good as the data presented to the committeeon the Swiss Serum and Vaccine Institute's CVD 103-HgR vaccine." (FDCReports, Feb. 1, 1993) According to a report made to the committee byMyron Levin, MD, of the Center for Vaccine Developmt, teh SS &amp;VIB vaccine has been teste i a variety of Phase I &amp; II clinicalstudies in "approximately 3,500 individuals in industrialized anddeveloping countries, (U.S.A., Switzerland, U.K., Austria, Italy,Indonesia, Thailand, Chile, Peru, Costa Rica, Mexico) in adults andchildren as young as 24 months of age." Becasue of the worldwideimpact of cholera, the World Health Organization (WHO) is sponsoringa large scale field trial in Jakarta, Indonesia to evaluate vaccineefficacy in a cholera endemic area.</P><P>Sources: MMWR 1993: 42: 89 93, MMWR 1992 40:562-S, InfectiousDisease News, Sept 1992.

Trials of the vaccine, known asLYSSAVAC BERNA HDC, were done at the Veterinary Schools at KansasState University, University of Oklahoma and University of Georgiaunder Investigational New Drug status. Early trials confirming thevaccine's safety and efficacy for pre-exposure as well as postexposure treatment of individuals bitten by rabid animals wereconducted in Europe and the Far East.</P><P><B>Not So Healthy Neighbors</B><BR>Once approved, the vaccine will be welcomed by Primary Carephysicians and Infectious Disease specialists alike. Since 1990, anepidemic of animal rabies has been spreading up and down the eastcoast of the U.S. "<B>Rabies is becoming a greater public healthconcern because rabid raccoons are moving into more densely populatedareas</B>," explained Iyorlumun Uhaa, DVM, PhD, epidemiologist withthe viral and rickettsial zoonoses branch, Centers for DiseaseControl (CDC).</P><P>Yes, he did say, "<B>raccoons</B>." While most people associatetransmission of rabies with bats, in fact, raccoons have recentlysurpassed bats as the prime carrier of the disease. And that's theproblem: Unlike bats, raccoons frequently roam through residentialneighborhoods, getting in fights with pet dogs. Exposure to rabies inthe general population is most often the result of people trying tobreak up these fights. While not necessarily bitten, saliva from therabid animal gets on hands or arms at the same time as cutsresulting, in a risk of infection.</P><P>The significance of this problem is demonstrated by statisticsfrom the state of New York. According to the Infectious Disease Newsreport, prior to the increase in rabid raccoons in the state, lessthan 100 people per year sought treatment as compared to <B>over800</B> the next year.</P><P><B>The Treatment Dilemma</B><BR>Contrary to the common perception, exposure to the rabies virus, evenwith a puncture wound from a rabid animal, does not necessarilyresult in infection. Thus, the decision to initiate post-exposuretreatment is a difficult one. Delaying treatment until symptomsappear is not an option. Once symptoms are manifested,the fatalityrate is 100%, even with treatment.</P><P>Further complicating matters is the fact that the appearance ofsymptoms is unpredictable. Because the rabies virus spreads throughnerve roots rather than the bloodstream, symptoms can appear asquickly as 2 weeks after exposure or not for many months afterwards.</P><P><B>Who is at Risk?</B><BR>Certain groups, such as veterinarians, wildlife and animal control,and zookeepers are the most obvious risk groups. Spelunkers areincluded as well due to the risk of contact with bats or carnivores.The CDC recommends preventive vaccination for these at-riskindividuals.</P><P>However, somewhat less commonly recognized is the <B>risk to theinternational traveler. </B>While vaccination against rabies is not arequirement for entry into any country of the world, travelers shouldbe aware of those areas where they might be at <B>increased risk forexposure to rabies.</B></P><P>The 1992 edition of the CDC's HEALTH INFORMATION FOR INTERNATIONALTRAVEL states "...the risk of rabies is highest in areas of the worldwhere dog rabies remain highly endemic, including (but not limitedto) parts of <B>Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Colombia,Ecuador, India, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam.</B>The disease is also found in dogs in most of the other countriesof <B>Africa, Asia, Central and South America" </B>with minorexceptions.</P><P><B>It recommends that a bite from any animal, not just a dog,needs evaluation. Prompt local cleansing of the wound with safe waterand generous amounts of soap can help reduce risk. Local healthauthorities should be notified, as well as a personal physician orState Department officials.</B></P><P>Sources: Infectious Disease News April 1992; CDC HEALTHINFORMATION FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL 1992</P><P><A HREF="#prod">Back to Berna Product List</A></P><P><HR></P><H2><A NAME="anchor792269"></A>What do travelers, women and olderpatients have in common?</H2><P>The answer: Individuals in these groups have been identified asbeing at "higher risk" for contracting tetanus since they are morelikely to lack protective antibodies.</P><P>At risk for tetanus? As surprising as it may seem since thepreventative vaccine,<A HREF="09_aboutberna.html#anchor836484">tetanus toxoid</A>, hasbeen available since the mid 1940's, cases of tetanus continue toappear. According to a recent MMWR Surveillance Report (Vol 41/SS 8,December 11, 1992), 117 cases from 34 states were reported during theperiod from 1989-1990. However, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)in Atlanta believes this does not reflect the true extent of theproblem. Their report concludes <I>"Because tetanus surveillancefindings are based only on reported cases, these results are likelyto underestimate the 'true' tetanus incidence in the United States.Completeness of reporting for tetanus mortality has been estimated at40% while completeness of reporting for tetanus morbidity may be evenlower."</I></P><P><B>1 out of 4 Patients Die</B><BR>Tetanus is not a disease to be taken lightly. While it is bothpreventable and treatable, still 24% of the patients reported to theCDC with tetanus died. Furthermore, the mortality rate clearlyincreased with age. No deaths were reported in patients under the ageof 40 as compared with 17% of patients 40-49 years old and 50% ofthose 80 years or older.</P><P>The CDC report also underscored the significant economic impactthis disease can have. Length of hospitalization required ranged from2--131 days. In addition, specialized care in the form of assistedventilation was necessary for almost half of the patients</P><P><B>An Ounce of Prevention</B><BR>Or in this case 1 /60th of an ounce (i.e., 0.5 ml) of vaccine boosterevery 10 years provides effective protection. However, a sizableportion of the U.S. Adult population are not up to-date with boostervaccinations, particularly older adults. In fact, serologic surveyshave shown that between 31-71 % of older adults lack protectivelevels of tetanus antibodies. A 1989 National Health Interview Surveywith a statistically reliable sample of U.S. adults found that only13% of persons over 65 years reported receiving a tetanus boostervaccination in the previous 5 years. This compares to 50% that wouldbe expected to have received a booster during that time period for avaccine that is routinely recommended every 10 years.</P><P>However, routine booster vaccinations for tetanus are frequentlydismissed under the assumption that if and when a patient is injured,the protective vaccines (tetanus toxoid and tetanus immune globulin)will be given.</P><P>The problem is that tetanus infection often result from wounds,frequently wood splinters, that aren't considered sufficiently severeby the patient to warrant seeking medical attention. As confirmationof this, the CDC points out that 2 out of 3 patients included in theSurveillance Report didn't bother to seek medical attention at thetime of the injury that resulted in tetanus. And this scenariooccurred in the U.S. where medical attention is easily and readilyavailable. If a patient is injured while traveling overseas,particularly in developing countries, adequate medical attentionmight not even be available.</P><P><B>A Mid-Decade Reminder</B><BR>Unlike during childhood where vaccinations are a key medicalpriority, the vaccination status of adults is often overlooked. TheCDC report reminds that vaccination status needs to be a routine partof the adult medical profile, particularly for elderly patients.Using mid-decade ages (e.g., 35, 45, 55, 65, etc.) may be an easybench mark to ensure that adult patients are protected.</P><P>* MMWR Surveillance Report, 41/SS-8.

Theirlatest guidelines, published in the MMWR*, continue to recognize theadvantageous side effect profile offered by VIVOTIF BERNA&#174(Typhoid Vaccine Live Oral Ty21a).</P><P>While there is no difference in efficacy, the ACIP stated:<BR><I>"Ty21a produces fewer adverse reactions than either ViCPS or theparenteral inactivated vaccine.

(This assumes that the vaccine has been well tolerated bythe patient and was not the cause of the patient failing to completethe initial regimen.)</P><P>When a patient is restarted on the vaccine, the physician shouldinstruct the patient to report any adverse event, as there is noclinical trial data on the safety of 5-6 doses administered in ashort period of time. However, based upon prior experience including:</P><UL>   <LI>administering larger doses of vaccine (up to 10 times more   than is currently in each capsule )      <LI>European re-immunization studies where only 1-2 years had   elapsed since primary immunization</UL><P>no adverse reactions were noted.</P><H2><IMG SRC="noneedle.gif" WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=36 ALIGN=middle>DrugInteractions:</H2><P><B>ANTIBIOTICS:</B><BR>AS A GENERAL RULE, NO ANTIBIOTICS SHOULD BE GIVEN 7 DAYS BEFORE THElst DOSE OR AFTER THE 4th DOSE OF VIVOTIF BERNA&reg;</P><P><B>ANTIMALARIALS:</B></P><P><B>Chloroquine:</B><BR>Studies in humans have shown that chloroquine, together withpyrimethamine-sulfadoxine, administered 24 HOURS PRIOR TO THE STARTOF THE VACCINATION SCHEDULE DID NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RATE OFSERO-CONVERSION as compared to a control group which took VIVOTIFBERNA&reg; alone.</P><P>In addition,in vitro studies have shown that the addition of up to200 mcg, of chloroquine/ml DID NOT NOTICEABLY AFFECT GROWTH RATE ofVIVOTIF BERNA&reg;.</P><P><B>DOXYCYCLINE:</B> See comments under Antibiotics</P><P><B>MEFLOQUINE (LARIAM&reg;): </B>In vitro studies have shown thatMefloquine at a concentration of 10 mcg/ml can inhibit the growth ofVIVOTIF BERNA&reg;. Concentrations of 5 mcg/ml had no affect on thegrowth rate.</P><P><I>As per the 1994 ACIP Guidelines: "Mefloquine could potentiallyaffect the immune response to oral live attenuated typhoid (Ty21a) ifboth are taken simultaneously To minimize this effect, it may beprudent to administer Ty2la typhoid vaccine at least 24 hours beforeor after a dose of Mefloquine."</I></P><P><B>ADDITIONAL FACTS FOR MEDICAL PERSONNEL:</B> The half-life forthe absorption of Mefloquine into the bloodstream ranges from roughly36 minutes to 2 hours, Therefore, within 24 hours of ingesting thesingle 25O mg weekly dose, essentially all of the Mefloquine wouldreasonably be expected to have been absorbed from the gut. Given therelatively large area of the gut, it may also be reasonably expectedthat the concentration of Mefloquine would be less than 5 mcg/ml andtherefore, not be expected to inhibit the growth of VIVOTIFBERN&reg;. However, studies to determine the actual concentration ofMefloquine in the gut 24 hours after ingestion have not been done.</P><P>If the physician decides Mefloquine and VIVOTIF BERNA&reg; are tobe used simultaneously, the following schedule is suggested tominimize the potential for adverse effect on efficacy:</P><UL>   <LI><B>Day 1:</B> Administration of Mefloquine      <LI><B>Day 2:</B> Administration of VIVOTIF BERNA&reg;      <LI><B>Day 8:</B> Administration of Mefloquine EARLY IN THE   MORNING</UL><P>Administration of VIVOTIF BERNA&reg; LATE IN THE EVENING.</P><P>If it's not possible to start Mefloquine 1 day before VIVOTIFBERNA&reg;, instructions for Day 1 should be the same as for Day 8.</P><P><B>IMMUNE GLOBULINS:</B> As per the 1994 ACIP Guidelines,concurrent administration of immune globulins and VIVOTIF BERNA&reg;is possible without affecting the immune response.</P><P><B>ORAL POLIO VACCINE: </B>As per the 1994 ACIP Guidelines, oralpolio vaccine can be administered BEFORE, SIMULTANEOUSLY or AFTERVIVOTIF BERNA&reg;.</P><P><B>OTHER TRAVEL-RELATED VACCINES:</B>There is no evidence thatsimultaneous administration of tetanus, diphtheria, rabies, measles,cholera, yellow fever or meningococcal vaccines interfere with theefficacy of VIVOTIF BERNA&reg;.</P><H2><IMG SRC="noneedle.gif" WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=36ALIGN=middle>Administration of Vaccine</H2><P><B>DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL WITHIN ( 1 ) HOUR OF TAKING VIVOTIFBERNA&reg;</B>.

According to experts in the field, it ranksinternationally amoung the most significant vaccine developments inthe last 25 years. To date, over 150 millions doses have been takenworldwide.</P><P><B>History and Development Begun</B><BR>in 1969, the development of VIVOTIF BERNA&#174 by the Swiss Serumand Vaccine Institute Berne (SS &amp; VIB) took 12 years. This uniqueoral vaccine resulted from gene manipulation of the Ty21 strain of<I>S. typhi.</I></P><P>The ability of<I> S. typhi</I> to cause disease and to induce aprotective immune response is dependent upon the bacteria possessinga complete lipopolysaccharide. The <I>S. typhi</I> Ty21a vaccinestrain, by virtue of a reduction in enzymes essential forlipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, is restricted in its ability toproduce complete lipopolysaccharide. However, a sufficient quantityof complete lipopolysaccharide is synthesized to evoke a protectiveimmune response.</P><P>The introduction of VIVOTIF BERNA&#174 in the United States in1990 was a joint effort between SS &amp; VIB and the US Military, whohelped to fund the field trials necessary for FDA approval. Followingit's approval, in 1991 the Armed Forces Epidemiology Board (eg. theDefense Department's medical advisory panel) recommended that alltroops going overseas be given the oral vaccine.</P><P>Since its introduction, over 100 million doses of VIVOTIFBERNA&#174 oral typhoid vaccine have been taken in the UnitedStates.</P><H3>VIVOTIF BERNA&#174 Facts at a Glance</H3><P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=1 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top colstart="1" align="LEFT">         <P>Type of Vaccine:      </TD><TD colstart="2">         <P>Live, attenuated bacteria (Ty21a strain)      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top colstart="1" align="LEFT">         <P>Dosage Form:      </TD><TD colstart="2">         <P>Enteric coated capsules.

In developing and producingan effective and stable smallpox vaccine, The Swiss Serum and VaccineInstitute (SS &amp; VIB) contributed significantly to this proudachievement of preventative medicine.</P><H2>Berna Products, Corp.</H2><P>is the North American subsidiary of The Swiss Serum and VaccineInstitute Berne (SS &amp; VIB). As one of 3 SS &amp; VIB subsidiarieslocated around the world, it was established to provide immediateaccess to SS &amp; VIB vaccines and biologicals for health careprofessionals in the US and Canada. Together with the manufacturingfacilities in Switzerland, Italy and Spain and the world-wide networkof Regional Offices located in Latin America and in the Near, Middleand Far East.</P><P><B>The Swiss Serum and Vaccine Institute Berne</B> enjoys a globalreputation as one of the <B>leading European manufacturers ofbiologics.</B></P><H2>Berna Worldwide</H2><P>Regardless of the language spoken, the name BERNA is a familiarone to physicians the world over.<BR><B>BERNA PRODUCTS</B> is the trademark by which the products of theSwiss Serum and Vaccine Institute Berne are known in 120 countriesaround the world. In addition, BERNA vaccines have been supplied tomore than 40 developing countries as a part of the WHO/UNICEFsponsored Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI).</P><P>The distribution of BERNA vaccines on a worldwide basisnecessitates a level of expertise beyond that required forpharmaceutical products in general. For example, due to the limitedshelf-life of vaccines, it is essential the the "cold chain" of doorto door refrigeration be insured, BERNA PRODUCTS are deliveredthroughout the US and Canada exclusively by Federal Express&amp;reg.Not only does Federal Express&reg; quality service maintain thiscold-chain guarantee, but it makes it possible to constantly trackeach shipment until it is delivered to into the hands of the healthprofessional.</P><P>And other example of the specialized expertise of the BERNAnetwork is the vast language requirements of labeling anddistribution for global distribution. While any pharmaceuticalproduct must obviously be prepared with the proper language labeling,frequently <A HREF="#anchor311616">BERNA vaccines</A> are neededunder emergency situations. To meet these needs, an in-house printingdepartment guarantees rapid, high quality packaging and labeling ofits products. The capability exists so that in emergencies, more than500,000 doses of vaccine can be packaged, labeled and shipped within48 hours regardless of whether the labeling must be in Chinese,Arabic or any other language.</P><H2><A NAME="anchor311616"></A><I>Berna Products</I> Product Line</H2><P>Swiss Serum and Vaccine Institute specializes in the production ofvaccines and biologic products for both adult and pediatric use.

        to be proactive in your safety and health
        measures&#133;yes, OSHA can cite you under the General
        Duty Clause &#150; Section 5(a)(1) of the OSHA Act.
        Specifically, &quot;5(a) Each employer-(1) shall furnish
        to each of the employees employment and a place of
        employment which are free from recognized hazards that
        are causing or are likely to cause death or serious
        physical harm to his employees.&quot; Other citations are
        possible under existing OSHA standards such as:
        respiratory protection, record keeping, monitoring and
        medical records access.<p>Since the outbreak of
        multidrug-resistant TB in several facilities,
        transmission of TB to healthcare workers has been in the
        spotlight again. Patients most likely to spread the
        disease are those who have unrecognized TB, are not
        effective anti-TB therapy, or those who have not been
        placed in TB isolation.</p>
        <p>OSHA has identified healthcare facilities and
        long-term care facilities for the elderly to be among the
        places with heightened TB rates. The guideline document,
        OSHA instruction CPL 2.106, Feb. 9, 1996, addresses
        enforcement methods and scheduling for occupational
        exposure to TB. You should expect to meet close scrutiny
        of your prevention and detection practices. According to
        OSHA, violations of these standards will be classified as
        serious.</p>
        <p>Compliance officers must inspect for workplace TB
        exposure in the following cases: in response to employee
        complaints; when notified of TB-related facilities; or as
        part of any industrial hygienic inspection conducted in
        workplaces where the CDC gas identified workers as having
        a greater incidence of TB infection than the general
        population. This means you.</p>
        <p>CDC has developed a protocol for minimizing
        transmission to healthcare workers. It includes
        engineering and administrative controls. Examples of
        engineering controls include: ventilation and air
        cleaning methods, controlling airflow direction, diluting
        and removing contaminated air by ventilation, and air
        cleaning with HEPA filters or ultraviolet light.
        Administrative controls include: rapid identification and
        treatment of TB cases, screening for healthcare workers,
        including administering, tuberculin skin tests, and use
        of isolation rooms for patients suspected of having TB.</p>
        <p>Contact your SIS loss control consultant, for a copy
        of the OSHA Instruction CPL 2.106 or the CDC&#146;s
        latest recommendations.</p>

                <td>The healthcare delivery system's single
                constant seems to be change. Drastic changes are
                being observed in financial reimbursement
                patterns, process improvement strategies,
                information systems, and regulations. Nursing
                care remains an essential focus, and improving
                patient satisfaction, loyalty, and the level of
                &quot;repeat business,&quot; is becoming
                increasingly critical to each healthcare
                organization's mission. <p>Patient-focused care
                (PFC) is one of the newer approaches to
                healthcare delivery which has arisen out of the
                realm of re-engineering. Several of its basic
                tenets include defining the patient as the center
                of all activity, and providing care as
                conveniently as possible for the patient (e.g.,
                at the bedside). As part of PFC, careful
                examination is conducted of all functional
                aspects of the care delivery system. This
                examination is intended to maximize each team
                member's contributions, and concurrently improve
                the continuity and quality of care. Standardized
                &quot;care paths&quot; are also used to assist in
                workload planning and as clinical treatment
                guidelines. </p>
                <p>During the transition from a more traditional
                delivery system to a PFC model, modification of
                an organization's administrative structure is
                often indicated. For instance, by reducing the
                number of levels of command, more timely
                decision-making and expanded scope of
                responsibility at each level is promoted. Within
                each functional department, specific clinical and
                non-clinical functions are examined, with a focus
                on determining the level of staff most
                appropriate to perform each task. Technical tasks
                are closely analyzed: &quot;Can an unlicensed
                person safely perform task X, or is a licensed or
                professional's skill required?&quot; Basic
                personal care and other support functions are
                also reviewed, with the goal of reducing
                professionals' time spent on basic tasks, to free
                up time for more complex or high-risk tasks. </p>
                <p>As administrators and nursing executives study
                the PFC concept or initiate transition to this
                care model, it is important to consider and
                address the potential risks associated with this
                type of change. Outlined below are several key
                risk management issues for consideration. </p>

                Central to PFC is task analysis. As each specific
                function or task is examined, with the question
                of which level of employee is appropriate to do
                this task, these questions should be addressed:
                What technical skills are required and how does
                one gain proficiency in those skills? Is
                on-the-job training sufficient, or is a formal
                program needed? What level of clinical judgment
                is required? Based on the potential adverse
                outcomes of the task, is a high level of clinical
                judgment needed in order to recognize and/or to
                respond to such outcomes? For example, feeding a
                person with dysphagia poses a risk of aspiration;
                would a patient tech or a nurse be better
                prepared to handle such a task, or does it depend
                on the type of patient? Do any applicable local,
                state, or federal regulations address the subject
                at hand? Each jurisdiction has various
                regulations pertaining to the practice of
                healthcare professionals, such as the Nurse
                Practice Act. These outline the scope of practice
                permitted for qualified professionals in each
                professional category (M.D., P.A., N.P., R.N.,
                LPN, P.T., O.T., CRNA, CNM, etc.). The regulatory
                boards also respond to specific questions from
                facilities: inquiries regarding whether a
                function is restricted to a specific professional
                category are often addressed by the pertinent
                regulatory authority(s). What positions do the
                professional associations hold regarding the
                issue under review? Many professional
                organizations are assembling data and/or offering
                guidance to their affiliate members regarding
                establishing the respective boundaries for
                licensed versus unlicensed assistive personnel
                (example: The Association of Operating Room
                Nurses has published a book on the role of
                assistive personnel). Knowledge of and reference
                to any pertinent position statements is
                essential. If an aspect of PFC is implemented
                which is at odds with a specific professional
                association's stance, this could become a
                significant focus of attention in the event of a
                malpractice claim. </td>

                From a proactive risk prevention point of view,
                it will be in an organization's best interest to
                carefully address the above issues during a
                transition to PFC. Abruptly transitioning a task
                from one staff category to another simply to
                reduce salary expenses could result in major
                malpractice exposure, if not handled effectively.
                <p>This article has outlined several important
                issues which warrant consideration when a
                facility is planning a transition from a
                traditional model to PFC, a new mode for care
                delivery which involves task reassignment. The
                cost advantages of expanding the role of
                assistive personnel, versus the use of more
                expensive professional staff, could quite easily
                be lost if the change results in disgruntled
                staff and an increase in malpractice claims. </p>

        for Obstetrical Units</font></h3>
        </center> <i><font color="#800000">Lynda Plummer, Senior
        Risk Management Consultant</font></i><p> With more and
        more patients getting involved in their care, the latest
        to come along in the obstetrical arena is a birth plan.
        These may also be known as a contract. The plan usually
        is a checklist or outline of choices that a woman in
        labor faces. If not from a checklist form, some patients
        actually present an outline of their expectations and
        &quot;requirements&quot; related to birth. </p>
        <p> Some plans outline choices such as a birthing suite,
        siblings in attendance at birth, type of anesthesia, etc.
        Others become expanded to include more clinical aspects
        such as administration of intravenous fluids, fetal
        monitoring, and types of delivery position. </p>
        <p> The plans are intended to be a means to facilitate
        discussions between expectant parents and care givers.
        They are not without some risk. These include the ability
        of the caregiver to comply with all requests (for
        example, a whirlpool may not be available), complying
        with the request may cause the facility to violate a
        written policy or a licensure requirement, and some
        patients may develop unrealistic expectations about the
        birth experience. </p>
        <p> Obstetrical caregivers need to be aware these plans
        exist. The facility may wish to communicate to
        physicians, midwives, and nursing staff of such plans by
        means of letters, memos, and/or educational programs. </p>
        <p> Do not wait until a patient walks into the unit in
        active labor and hands the nurse a &quot;contract&quot;
        to decide what to do! A multi-disciplinary team,
        including the risk manager, should be developed to
        recommend ways to deal effectively with patients who
        present birth plans. </p>
        <p> When addressing the use of birth plans, coordination
        among all members of the healthcare team is essential to
        ensure all items on the plan have been discussed with the
        expectant parents. It is also essential to document the
        discussions and communicate elements of the plan with all
        members of the team.</p>

        Communicating with the patient about their birth plans is
        particularly important. Identify who will be primarily
        responsible for the educational process related to birth
        plans. For example, physicians will want to discuss some
        issues such as monitoring, episiotomy, etc. Some other
        aspects of education may be delegated by the physician to
        the office nurse. It is also necessary to keep the

        procedures and concerns the expectant parents may have.</td>

        example, if there is a limited number of birthing rooms,
        this needs to be indicated to the patient and that every

        Have situations been addressed with the patient in
        advance? What alternatives will be considered and offered

        <p><i>DIR takes Interest in Computerized Records' Risk
        Management Potential</i></p>
        <p align="center"><i>By Mary Anne Clause, Senior Risk
        Management Consultant</i></p>
        <p>If you are not yet comfortable with the concept of
        electronic medical records (EMR), you're not alone. This
        article is designed to help those readers who are not
        already computer buffs become familiar with the basics of
        this technology. DIR supports the use of EMR systems
        because of the many features available to streamline,
        standardize, and safeguard care decisions and
        recordkeeping. We are pleased to announce that DIR's
        Board of Directors has approved a 10% premium discount
        for physicians that use EMR systems with recommended risk
        management applications. </p>
        <p><b>CHALLENGES</b><br>
        EMR systems are not without potential problems. Usual
        fears center around &quot;downtime&quot; or computer
        &quot;crashes&quot; and loss of data. These fears are not
        as realistic as they were several years ago. The
        reliability of both hardware and software is much
        improved. Another concern is the need to maintain hard
        files for incoming reports, signed consents, etc. Some
        offices scan documents into the electronic file and
        others that are networked to hospitals, labs, pharmacies,
        etc. have data transmitted directly into the EMR. </p>
        <p><b>SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY</b><br>
        Electronic records are becoming a necessity as the demand
        for information grows. Computer networks that allow
        physicians, hospitals, payors, and other support services
        to interface, promote rapid access to the patient's
        record and facilitate close collaboration among
        caregivers. However, an increased ability to share
        records creates an increased risk of unauthorized
        disclosure. Laws formed on a state level that govern the
        use of medical information, are often considered
        inconsistent, conflicting, and unclear. Few states have
        addressed the use of electronic records. To make matters
        worse, large data networks can transmit information
        across state lines in a flash. Several attempts have been
        made to propose federal privacy legislation, including
        the Fair Health Information Practices Act of 1995, the
        Medical Records Confidentiality Act, and the Medical
        Privacy in the Age of New Technologies Act of 1996. None
        of these have passed through committee. State
        legislatures are showing interest and concern. In 1994
        VA. CODE 54.1-2403.2 was enacted by Virginia's General
        Assembly giving legal protection to medical records of
        health care providers that are stored by computerized or
        other electronic processes or microfilm. This statute
        requires that the record identify the location of
        documents or other information that cannot be
        technologically stored. It also states that if the
        technological storage process creates an unalterable
        record, the health care provider shall not be required to
        maintain paper copies of the records stored
        electronically. Security safeguards are available in many
        EMR systems on the market. They include many of the
        required elements listed in the DIR premium discount
        program at the conclusion of this article. </p>
        <p><b>WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?</b><br>
        The potential for EMR systems is limitless. The wave of
        the future is here for some systems linked by network
        where: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>prenatal documentation flow sheets and obstetric
                records are accessed from delivery and labor
                rooms; </li>
            <li>lab work and x-rays are ordered by computer and
                results directly down-loaded into the physician's
                system; </li>
            <li>admission information is transmitted from office
                to hospital; </li>
            <li>physicians access current medical literature or
                practice guidelines on their own systems; and </li>
            <li>physicians' computer screens are flagged when a
                patient fails to pick up an ordered drug or
                report for a scheduled test. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Networks built to acceptable standards will facilitate
        the flow of information necessary to generate reliable
        outcomes. Hospitals, managed care organizations, and
        networked systems with an interest in outcomes research
        may eventually require the use of EMR systems. Insurers
        will evaluate a practice's quality of care by efficiency
        and outcomes data, and patient satisfaction survey
        results. </p>
        <p><b>TIPS WHEN CHOOSING A SYSTEM</b><br>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Set goals and objectives before searching for an
                EMR system. </li>
            <li>Develop a list of vendors who have longevity in
                the business and maintain good reputations for
                service and updates. </li>
            <li>Send a request for all product information, a
                demonstration disk (usually free), and
                information on any special needs. </li>
            <li>Develop questions for selected vendors that
                reflect your needs. Request a proposal, including
                costs. Set a deadline. </li>
            <li>Compare responses and arrange for an in-office
                demonstration with on-hands practice. Encourage
                physician involvement. </li>
            <li>Establish compatibility of hardware and software
                with other software, to allow for flexibility and
                eventual expansion. </li>
            <li>Ensure that your final choice is a system that is

        <p><b>DIR'S PREMIUM DISCOUNT PROGRAM FOR EMRs</b><br>
        The EMR premium discount program provides an in-office
        assessment of the utilization of established risk
        management strategies by EMR users. Practices that have
        not entered medical records into their system
        retroactively are eligible for this review one year after
        installation. Others with conversion of all active files
        may call Risk Management for a consultation visit at any
        time. Eligibility for the premium discount will be
        determined by a scoring of required and recommended risk
        management elements. Required elements for a consultation
        visit are as follows: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users are assigned individual passwords which are
                periodically changed; </li>
            <li>Security levels restricting users to relevant job
                category sections are in place; </li>
            <li>An efficient backup system is scheduled regularly
                with at least partial storage off site; </li>
            <li>A lock-in feature renders stored data
                unalterable; </li>
            <li>Anti-tampering programming automatically locks
                out inappropriate attempts to access records; </li>
            <li>An office policy supports discipline and training
                regarding the confidential nature of passwords
                and other identifiers; </li>
            <li>All practice physicians document in the
                electronic medical record in a consistent manner;
            </li>
            <li>Patient medication allergies are listed in a
                prominent location and are updated on a regular
                basis; </li>
            <li>A system is in place to document patients who
                no-show or cancel and any potential follow-up
                actions; </li>
            <li>All entries and changes made in the medical

        <p><b>ITS UP TO YOU</b><br>
        Whether you feel electronic medical records are worth the
        trouble and expense or not, in the long run they appear
        to be inevitable. Cost efficiency research is in its
        infancy, but initial results are promising. Technology in
        this field is changing rapidly. This article reviews only
        a minimum of basic issues surrounding EMR systems, so
        individual investigation is highly recommended. This is
        not an easy decision. Certainly, there are risks
        associated with moving forward as well as waiting too
        long. However, most sources point to a competitive
        advantage, through market differentiation as well as
        experience gained in using this technology, for those who
        choose EMR. </p>

        <br>
        <font color="#800000"><h3>What is Medical Payments
        Coverage?</h3>
        </font><br>
        </center> <i><font color="#800000">William Wilson,
        Underwriter</font></i><p> Medical Payments coverage is an
        additional coverage provided under the Commercial General
        Liability policy with a sublimit of $5,000 for any one
        person. This coverage is often referred to as &quot;first
        aid coverage&quot; as it affords automatic payment of
        limited medical expenses. </p>
        <p> Medical Payments coverage is designed to pay
        reasonable medical expenses for bodily injury caused by
        the insured's operations, or by an accident on the
        insured's premises, including areas next to premises the
        insured owns or leases. It is important to note, payment
        is limited to those expenses which are incurred and
        reported within one year of the date of the accident, and
        the injured person must submit to an examination, at our
        expense, by physicians of our choice as we reasonably
        require. </p>
        <p> This additional coverage basically intends to pay for
        bodily injury sustained by persons of the general public
        while on the insured's premises or while being exposed to
        the insured's operations. The important aspect of this
        coverage is that payment is made without regard to the
        legal liability of the insured. It is believed that in
        providing this coverage, we will assist in decreasing
        both frequency and severity of bodily injury suits. This
        is based on the assumption that the inclination of the
        injured party to sue is reduced if they receive
        conciliatory care at the time of the accident. </p>
        <p> This coverage is designed to be somewhat limited in
        scope, and there are a number of exclusions. These
        exclusions include bodily injury to any insured, any
        person hired to do work for or on behalf of an insured,
        any person injured on the insured's premises that the
        person normally occupies, any person for which workers
        compensation benefits are payable, any person injured
        while taking part in athletics, and bodily injury due to
        war, whether or not declared, or any act or condition
        incidental to war. </p>
        <p> If the general liability has a deductible, there will
        be no Medical Payments coverage. However, there will be
        coverage for expenses incurred by the insured for first
        aid administered to others at the time of an accident.
        Similar to the terms of the Medical Payments coverage,
        the accident must arise from bodily injury caused by the
        insured's operations, or by an accident on the insured's
        premises. </p>
        <p> Although this is no-fault coverage, all medical
        payments paid by TVIR on behalf of an insured will be
        reflected as an incurred loss under the Commercial
        General Liability policy. Consequently, these payments
        may have a direct impact on your General Liability
        premium calculation through the experience rating
        program. </p>
        <p> Should you need any additional information regarding
        this coverage, contact your Agent or TVIR Account
        Manager. </p>

<h1>Diagnosis? &#133; Sick Building Syndrome</h1>

<h1>Treatment? &#133; Early Claims Intervention</h1>

<p><em>By Mark Hyland, Assistant Vice President</em></p>

<hr color="#008080">

<p>Everyone has heard of the phenomenon of &quot;sick building
syndrome.&quot; Usually we associate this problem with modern
office buildings. Healthcare facilities, of all sorts, are not
immune to this modern risk. Well documented case studies of
&quot;sick-hospital syndrome&quot; are available in the medical
journals. Our experience shows that it is most often the older
facility which is undergoing construction or has recently been
refurbished that experiences this kind of employee complaint and
subsequent workers; compensation claim.</p>

<p>The best treatment is Early Response-to a worker&#146;s first
complaint of &quot;something is making me sick&quot; as well as
to an employee&#146;s compensation claim for an occupational
respiratory ailment.</p>

<p>&quot;Indoor air pollution&quot; signs and symptoms usually
fall into two categories-those impacting the general environment
and those which have begun to affect employee health. Workers may
report unusual smells or dust in their areas. They may even have
an idea of the origin of the nuisance (for example, the exhaust
from the delivery truck which is going into the building&#146;s
air intake vent.) Other times employees only begin to suspect
that their health problems are related to a workplace exposure
after they gave received treatment. Symptoms of upper-respiratory
irritation and lower respiratory distress, as well as burning
eyes, dry skin and dermatitis, headache, fatigue and dizziness
may be caused by poor air quality.</p>

<p>A quick response to early reports of environmental problems
may give you the chance to fix the problem before employees begin
to go to their doctors or the employee health nurse. Bring in
your maintenance manager or the facility&#146;s industrial
hygienist and do physical surveys of the site in question. Try to
identify if anything has changed in that location recently.
Inspect the air handling equipment-with an emphasis on looking at
the total system from air intake to exhaust. Further detective
work might involve air monitoring, wipe samples and possibly
physical exams for exposed employees.</p>

<p>If an employee files a worker&#146;s compensation claim, a
quick response is also the best management practice. Your SIS
claims consultant should be notified. All medical records must be
obtained. Expert medical opinions may be appropriate. The
employee&#146;s work site needs to be surveyed and statements
obtained from the claimant as well as fellow workers. Any
documentation of earlier employee complaints should be reviewed.
Other experts may need to be brought in to conduct further
investigations.</p>

<p>A prompt management response is also appropriate when a final
decision is made concerning a claim. Ignoring early reports or
delaying decisions on claims will only raise employee concerns
further. In the case of sick building syndrome &quot; a sniff in
time saves nine!&quot;</p>

No matter what the technical safety or health issues-from fire
and emergency training required at 29 CFR 191038 and .157 to the
proposed standard for TB-OSHA expects the employer to provide a
basic level of safety education and training to exposed
employees. This expectation is reflected in the last four
elements that make up OSHA&#146;s 1989 voluntary <i>Guidelines
for Safety and Health Program Management</i>, which we have been
reviewing the past editions of <i>Today&#146;s Workplace</i>.</p>

<p>At the minimum, employees must understand the hazards to which
they may be exposed and how to prevent harm to themselves and
others. This understanding helps employees accept and follow your
established protections for specific hazards. For example, it is
hard for employees first entering the healthcare professions to
understand the need for all of the personal protective
equipment-masks, goggles, gloves &amp; gowns-which are standard
protocol. Education concerning the vectors of disease
transmission between patient and caregiver provides the
foundation for training on exactly when and how to use such
equipment.</p>

<p>While all employees need hazard awareness education and
training, supervisors and managers require added information.
Supervisors should be given special training to help them in
their leadership roles. They need to be taught to look for hidden
hazards, to insist upon the safe maintenance of their work areas,
and to reinforce employee hazard training through performance
feedback and, when necessary, fair and consistent enforcement of
organizational rules.</p>

<p>Managers must understand their own responsibilities for safety
and health. They may not need to attend classroom training on
hazards. However, organizations should provide their managers
with multiple sources of information that will raise safety and
health awareness. Seminars, workshops, information bulletins,
newsletters and vides are suitable.</p>

<p>Is your plan for safety and health education and training
up-to-date? Is it responsive to each employee&#146;s exposures,
duties and position within your facility? Your SIS loss control
consultant can help you evaluate and design appropriate training
strategies. In addition, SIS can schedule specially designed
workshops for your management and supervisory staff. Call your
SIS loss control consultant and ask for the &quot;On-Site
Educational Programs&quot; information.</p>

        <p><font color="#800000"><br>
        <i>Robert Jones, Vice President of Claims</i></font> </p>
        <p>TVIR&#146;s Hospital Professional Liability business
        has experienced three consecutive years of declining
        claim frequency. A reliable gauge of claim frequency is a
        comparison of the number of arising cases to an exposure
        base such as bed equivalency. These are numeric values
        given a hospital&#146;s potential exposure areas such as
        acute care beds, clinic visits, bassinets, etc.
        TVIR&#146;s ratio of arising claims per 100 bed
        equivalencies has been on the decline since 1992, and in
        1995 we experienced 1.84 claims per 100 bed
        equivalencies. This nearly equals the five-year low from
        1991 of 1.78 claims per 100 bed equivalencies. </p>
        <p>Indemnity reserves on TVIR&#146;s open HPL claims have
        also experienced a decline in the past five years. Over
        the five-year period, the indemnity reserves have
        decreased 7% while expenses have increased 94%. Indemnity
        reserves represent the dollars set aside to pay
        settlements and verdicts, while the expense reserves pay
        defense lawyers, medical experts, private investigators,
        etc. While the declining indemnity reserve is a favorable
        trend, the expenses are growing significantly. Part of
        this rapid growth in the expense line is due to
        TVIR&#146;s efforts to litigate more cases. For example,
        in 1995 TVIR litigated 49 medical malpractice cases to
        verdict, wining 35, or 71%, of these contests. </p>
        <p>In 1995 TVIR&#146;s average indemnity payment was
        $23,288 while an additional $11,156 was spent in average
        expense payments on a per case basis. Over the past five
        years the indemnity payments on cases closed during that
        period increased 53%, approximately 10% a year. Expenses,
        on the other hand, have increased 88% over the past 5
        years, nearly 18% per year.</p>

<h1>Group Self-Insurance For Workers&#146; Compensation: What are
the Benefits?</h1>

<p><em>By Dan Lewis, Manager, Account Services</em></p>

<hr color="#008080">

<p>When commercial insurance carriers began leaving the
workers&#146; compensation marketplace in the mid to late
1980&#146;s, group self-insurance became a viable workers&#146;
compensation solution for many healthcare organizations. In fact,
these market conditions brought about the creation of the five
workers&#146; compensation groups that Specialty Insurance
Services, Inc. manages today:</p>

<ul>
    <li><font color="#008080">Healthcare Providers group</font></li>
    <li><font color="#008080">MHA Private Workers&#146;
        Compensation Group</font></li>
    <li><font color="#008080">MHA Public Workers&#146;
        Compensation Group</font></li>
    <li><font color="#008080">SunHealth Group Self-Insurance
        Association of North Carolina</font></li>
    <li><font color="#008080">THA-Workers&#146; Compensation
        Group</font></li>
</ul>

<p>These groups continue to provide their members many advantages
that cannot be obtained in the commercial marketplace. In
addition to providing a long-term, stable workers&#146;
compensation market, groups provide the following advantages:</p>

<p><font color="#008080">Cost reduction</font>-Since groups
eliminate many expenses that would be incurred with insurance
companies, such as insurance company profits and assigned risk
charges, members generally see reduced costs. Investment income
earned by the group also reduces overall costs.</p>

<p><font color="#008080">Specialized services</font>-loss control
and claims services are tailored to meet the specific needs of
the group&#146;s members. This can result in improved loss
experience, which further reduces the members&#146; cost.</p>

<p><font color="#008080">Self-governance</font>-a group is
governed by an elected board, which makes decisions on behalf of
the members of the group. This allows the members to make
decisions concerning the direction and operation of the group.</p>

<p><font color="#008080">Ownership</font>-members of the group
share in the equity (profit) of generated by the operation of the
group. This is contrasted with a commercial carrier, where the
profits stay with the insurance company.</p>

<H1>Beware of the IRS's Right of Redemption</H1>
<HR>
Whenever you represent a lienholder in bidding on encumbered property at foreclosure or a judicial sale, and in so doing you will be extinguishing a junior federal tax lien, beware of how the IRS's statutory right of redemption (as set forth at 28 U.S.C. Section 2410, of the Internal Revenue Code, and 26 U.S.C. Section 7425(d))   applies in your state.  If the IRS is made a party to a suit to quiet title, foreclose a mortgage or other lien or any other action, the IRS has the right (within 120 days of sale) to pay "the actual amount paid by the purchaser at such sale which, in the case of a purchaser who is the holder of the lien being foreclosed, shall include the amount of the obligation secured by such lien to the extent satisfied by reason of such sale . . . ." 28 U.S.C. Section 2410(c).  Malpractice claims have arisen where the attorney is unfamiliar with the IRS right of redemption, and successfully bids the property in for his lienholder at less than the full amount of the lien (e.g.,  to save Commissioner's fees).  Thereafter, the IRS notifies the lien holder/purchaser of its intent to exercise its right of redemption by tendering to the lien holder/purchaser the actual amount he paid for the property.  This forces the lien holder/purchaser to either negotiate with the IRS to pay off the outstanding tax liens or to accept less than the full amount of his security interest in satisfaction of the debt.  Where the value of the property equals or exceeds the lien holder's payment, the IRS's exercise of its redemption rights can result in actual damages to the lien holder and could form the basis for a legal malpractice claim.  Being aware of this right and its application in your jurisdiction will allow you to properly counsel the lienholder in determining the bid range or amount.

        </center> A Message to Subscribers from Kenneth B.
        Swenson, Chairman of The Virginia Insurance Reciprocal
        Board of Directors, and William F. Jacobs, President of
        The Virginia Insurance Reciprocal.</font> <p> The changes
        in the healthcare field now are well documented. How the
        Virginia Insurance Reciprocal (TVIR) responds to the
        changes will determine its future. If 1995 is an
        indicator, TVIR will continue to be a successful
        organization. In spite of the dramatic changes, TVIR
        enjoyed an outstanding year. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Customer satisfaction is high, with 93 percent of
                customers renewing their policies in 1995. </li>
            <li>Net income increased to more than $10 million,
                the 10th consecutive year of profits. </li>
            <li>Policyholders' surplus has grown to $78.7
                million. </li>
            <li>Approximately $6 million in equity was returned
                to hospitals in Virginia, Tennessee and
                Mississippi last year. Since 1980, the total
                equity returned to subscribers exceeds $50
                million. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <font color="#800000">TVIR moved out in front of change
        in 1995 through bold new initiatives:</font> <ul>
            <li>We encouraged the formation of The Reciprocal
                Alliance, a new insurance company that will meet
                the needs of healthcare systems in the managed
                care era. </li>
            <li>A system was developed to designate Preferred
                Agents in selected markets, to expand marketing
                efforts in areas not served directly by our
                marketing staff. </li>
            <li>Internally senior management initiated a
                strategic thinking process, enabling us to
                conduct business based on a continuous evaluation
                of current information about customers and
                markets. </li>
            <li>The staff was involved in surveys, task forces
                and more focused communication to become a more
                customer-driven, well-trained organization. </li>
        </ul>
        The results demonstrate the work. Three prestigious
        healthcare systems became new subscribers, and AHA
        Services, an affiliate of the Arkansas Hospital
        Associate, gave its exclusive endorsement to TVIR.
        Management is confident that the forward momentum of TVIR
        will continue in 1996 with favorable results from a full
        year of the Preferred Agents system, the Arkansas
        endorsement and the impact of the Alliance. As a
        customer-owned organization, TVIR is focused on customers
        and driven by them. TVIR is innovative and flexible, and
        meeting the needs of the healthcare field. <p> Our
        success is due to how well the people affiliated with
        TVIR work together. The advice and counsel of our
        governing organizations offer enormous benefits, helping
        us to stay a step ahead of changes in the industry. At
        the same time, senior management provides outstanding
        leadership, initiating marketing strategies that reflect
        the vision of TVIR. Carrying out these initiatives are
        the officers and staff of VPUI professionals who have
        committed themselves to fulfilling our customer-focused
        mission. Together, the TVIR team is prepared for the
        future, and we are excited about helping our customers
        meet the needs of the people and communities they serve. </p>

<h2>Helping Safety &amp; Health Committee Members Become
&quot;Do-ers&quot;</h2>

<hr color="#008080">

<p><font color="#008080"><strong>&quot;It must be considered that
there is nothing<br>
more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful<br>
of success, nor more dangerous to handle than<br>
to initiate a new order of things.&quot;<br>
-Machiavelli</strong></font></p>

<p>You've been sitting on your organization's safety and health
committee for awhile now. Maybe it's the way Theresa is reading
her nursing charts until it's her turn to report, maybe it's the
way Ralph simply takes everyone's written suggestions, hole
punches them and stashes them in his committee binder (didn't he
wipe dust off of it when he sat down?), or how Julian is going on
<em>ad nauseam</em> about the broken electrical outlet at the
nurse's station. There's a nagging little voice at the back of
your mind saying &quot;we're not doing anything to solve the big
problems.&quot; Does this sound familiar to you?</p>

<p>Safety &amp; Health Committees are required by Joint
Commission and recommended by OSHA guidelines, but that doesn't
guarantee good committees. Another law to pay attention to when
forming safety committees is the National Labor Relations Act and
its restrictions on &quot;employee dominated&quot; committees.</p>

<p>This stereotype of a S &amp; H committee is a bunch of boring
people sitting around a table listening to reports on recent
incidents. Yet, there's real gold to be mined if you can turn the
committee into Do-ers, not just passive attendees. Your success
is influenced by the way management sets up and empowers
committee members to reach beyond the confines of problem giving
to become problem solvers.</p>

<p>Depending on your approach, the safety committee can be a
valuable two-way communication tool with significant powers for
action, or nothing more than a waste of everyone's time. One of
the keys is good planning. Some organizations operate
interrelated S &amp; H committee responsible for different
functions (i.e., a policy committee, an employee safety &amp;
health committee, a committee for facilities &amp; maintenance).
Groups work on their own issues, identifying the &quot;big&quot;
problems through data analysis, incidents and other reporting
mechanisms. They also report to each other, coming together to
work on common problems such as implementing the new OSHA
personal protective equipment standard. If your organization
isn't large enough to warrant several committees, a single one,
which is well organized and operated, can be just as effective.
The number and arrangement of committees is not as important as
understanding what makes a S &amp; H committee
&quot;successful.&quot;</p>

Picking the right Chair is very important. While the safety and

distributed more evenly and the voices of all members encouraged.
Look for a good meeting &quot;conductor&quot; that everyone
respects and likes.</font></p>

picking your members, include a person from the department with
the poorest mishap record (these people already have a problem).
Invite someone with a demonstrated interest in safety and health
issues, and someone from a department with an outstanding safety
and health record (these people will be invested in getting
things done and have experience from which others can learn).
Include someone to represent employee's interest as well as
supervisors of major departments. It may sometimes be helpful to
call in experts as needed to solve specific problems. These do
not need to be permanent members to be effective.</font></p>

<p>Committees are great for presenting ideas, encourage
understanding and cooperation, and building consensus. However,
everyone recognizes how quickly a poorly run committee can drain
energy and initiative. Most of the energy zappers can be managed
if you set up a structure in advance.</p>

<p>Schedule the meetings for the same time each month (i.e. the
third Thursday at 9 a.m.). If possible, set up tables and chairs
in a circular format. Remember to encourage eye contact-it's
important for successful communications. If there are not enough
agenda items to warrant a meeting, cancel it! Nothing destroys a
good committee faster than the thought that members are wasting
their time.</p>

<p>The meeting facilitator should collect agenda items and
circulate a meeting schedule at least a week in advance. Someone
should be prepared to keep minutes (including who comes and who
is assigned action items). Serve good coffee and healthy snacks
to express how important the committee's work is.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/check.gif" alt="Checkmark"
        width="15" height="15"></td>
        <td><font color="#008080"><strong><u>Conducting the
        Meeting</u></strong></font></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Use the first part of the meeting as a &quot;show and
tell&quot; where members share new safety equipment, videos,
brochures or other resources that are available. This sets a
positive, energetic tone. Don't spend too much time reviewing
minutes and standing committee reports. The bulk of the
committee's time should be spent analyzing data, looking for and
discussing big problems, matching existing resources with needs,
and setting up new policy, procedures, and training. (Julian's
broken electrical outlet should never have made it to the S &amp;
H Committee, that's what the maintenance department's work order
system should cover.)</p>

<p>To avoid the &quot;Talkers not Do-ers&quot; problem, try
keeping a log with all pending big problems listed. A problem
doesn't get dropped from the committee's agenda and log until it
has been resolved. If one problem seems to be malingering and
requires resources beyond the committee, it's time to call in an
expert or the attention of upper management. However, if it's an
individual who seems to be malingering by taking too much of the
committee's time or constantly interrupting and talking over
everyone else, consider creative ways to facilitate group
discussions.</p>

<p>Remember the wooden gavel presidents of community clubs are
presented upon the inauguration? The gavel is the European
version of the Native American &quot;talking stick&quot;-whoever
holds the gavel or talking stick holds the attention of the
group. Try introducing a symbolic object as the committee's
&quot;talking stick.&quot; Whenever Ralph is holding the bright
red stethoscope, everyone is to be attentive and quiet. When he's
through making his point, it goes back in the middle of the table
for the next person to claim. It may seem weird but it works!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/check.gif" alt="Checkmark"
        width="15" height="15"></td>
        <td><font color="#008080"><strong><u>Assign Action Items</u></strong></font></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Once the committee settles on a course of action, write down
the action points on separate index cards. Lay them in the middle
of the table and ask members to pick up the cards with the tasks
they'll undertake. This may include continuing research or
leading a subcommittee to search for more detail. Any left-overs
(the stuff nobody wants to do) then can be equitably distributed.
Members will claim the types of tasks they enjoy doing and you
can increase the successful use of individual talents. Be sure
there is agreement on when tasks will be completed and how they
will be reported back to the committee. Members should be
encouraged to vocalize their thanks to each other for taking on
and performing tasks. Create an environment of positive feedback.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/check.gif" alt="Checkmark"
        width="15" height="15"></td>
        <td><font color="#008080"><strong><u>Dissemination of
        Information to Others</u></strong></font></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Report, report, report. But, remember to protect corporate and
individual confidentiality when reporting. Joint Commission and
OSHA are not the only audiences for your committee reports. By
writing everything down, you're making sure that each committee
member knows what they've committed to do. By keeping employees
and management informed, you're helping lay the groundwork for
their future participation and support when the committee asks
for it. Good communication is vital to effective group work. A
strong paper trail not only shows where you've been, it points
the way to where you're going.</p>

<p>Where are the bran muffins, the index cards, and that silly
stethoscope? We've got some work to do!</p>

        Relationship Guidelines</h3>
        </font></center><br>
        <i>The following article has been reprinted courtesy of
        The Virginia Board of Medicine.</i><p> The Drug Control
        Act requires a physician to have a bonafide
        physician/patient relationship with a person before
        writing a prescription for a controlled substance. In
        addition to the problem of drug abuse/diversion, the
        Board continues to see cases where a physician prescribes
        for a person with whom he does not have a true
        physician/patient relationship. Therefore, the Board has
        determined to reprint the following guidelines. </p>
        <p> <font color="#800000"><b>Physician/Patient
        Relationship Guidelines</font></b> </p>
        <p> The Board of Medicine respects the professional
        integrity of physicians and recognizes that most
        physicians in Virginia comply with the law. However, drug
        abuse/diversion continues to be a very serious problem
        with has caused the Board concern and occupies
        considerable investigatory time. </p>
        <p> After a lengthy study, the Board, on November 23,
        1985, adopted the following guidelines to define a valid
        physician/patient relationship to assist Board
        investigators in drug abuse-diversion cases. The Board
        believes it is important to remind physicians of these
        guidelines, so we are reprinting them. These guidelines
        do not carry the force of law or regulation, but are
        intended as guidelines only. </p>
        <p> <font color="#800000"><b>A valid physician/patient
        relationship is documented by the presence of medical
        records and should contain the following as outlined:</font></b>

            <li>An appropriate history and physical or mental
                examination for the patient's chief complaint as
                appropriate to the specialty; </li>

        <p align="center"><i>by W. Scott Johnson, Esquire</i> </p>
        <p>The 1996 session of the Virginia General Assembly
        marked success for Virginia physicians in that
        legislation was not introduced which would repeal or
        increase the one million dollar medical malpractice cap
        on damages. Likewise, in past sessions legislation has
        been introduced to amend the statutes of limitation
        extending the time in which a patient has to file a
        medical malpractice action. There were no such
        legislative attempts this session. </p>
        <p>The primary focus of the 1996 session was directed on
        managed care issues. Armed with constituent letters and
        complaints, legislators launched a frontal attack on the
        insurance carriers and HMO companies in an attempt to
        level the playing field which many have perceived to be
        tilted in favor of the carriers and companies, not the
        consumers. </p>
        <p>The first attack centered on the length of stay for
        inpatient moms. Four legislative bills were introduced to
        mandate by statute the length of stay depending on
        whether mom delivers by Cesarean section or vaginally.
        The compromise legislation that was enacted will have the
        length of stay determined by the attending obstetrician
        though the use of &quot;Standards for
        Obstetric-Gynecologic Services&quot; as prepared by ACOG.
        With regards to neonates, the attending pediatricians
        will rely on the &quot;Guidelines for Prenatal Care&quot;
        as prepared by the American Academy of Pediatrics. </p>
        <p>The next attack focused on the right of female
        patients to have direct access to their OB-GYNs.
        Legislation was enacted to require carriers and HMO
        companies to permit female patients over the age of 13 to
        have direct access to a participating OB-GYN for an
        annual visit. Annual visits will not require a referral
        from a primary care provider. However, an OB-GYN cannot
        refer a patient for additional services (another
        specialist) without consultation or examination by the
        primary care provider. </p>
        <p>The most significant managed care focus centered on
        physician provider panels. Legislation was enacted to
        allow enrollees to continue to receive care from a
        primary care provider for up to 60 days after the primary
        care physician has been terminated from the provider
        panel, provided that termination was not for cause.
        Primary care providers must be given notice when
        specialty providers are terminated from a provider panel.
        With regards to physician contracts, carriers are
        prohibited from: 1) requiring physicians to indemnify the
        negligence of the carrier, 2) requiring the physician to
        waive his right to seek legal redress against the
        carrier, and 3) prohibiting, impeding, or interfering
        with provider-patient discussions of treatment options.
        Carriers must permit and require providers to discuss
        treatment options with patients. </p>
        <p>The final managed care focus resulted in the enactment
        of legislation to require carriers to disclose to
        enrollees or purchasers of insurance, all types of
        payment arrangements that the carrier uses to compensate
        participating physicians including but not limited to
        &quot;withholds, bonus payments, capitation and
        fee-for-service discounts.&quot; </p>
        <p>In conclusion, the managed care focus of the 1996
        session precluded significant legislation in the medical
        malpractice arena. It is difficult to predict what will
        await physicians in the 1997 session but a focus on
        medical malpractice reforms is a strong possibility. </p>

<p>
<b><i>Technologies are available today to cut energy use, reduce costs, and
protect the
environment.  U.S. industry is increasingly involved in developing and using
these
technologies, thanks to the efforts of this office.</b></i>
<p>
<b><i>Overview</b></i><p>
<p>
The goal of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EE) is to
develop
cost-effective energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies that protect
the
environment and support the nation's economic competitiveness.  EE achieves
this
goal through a strong and balanced program of research, development, and market
deployment through private sector partnerships.  EE is organized around the
four main
energy users -- utilities, industry, transportation, and buildings -- as well
as an outreach
arm of technical and financial assistance.  This orientation toward end users
has helped
the technology development programs focus on addressing the needs of the
marketplace.  Department of Energy (DOE) projections of energy use indicate
that by
2030, renewables could supply as much as 28% of the nation's energy.
<p>
<b><i>The Office of Utility Technologies</b></i><p>
<p>
Electricity now accounts for 36% of the nation's energy consumption, and its
use is
expected to grow 15% by the end of the century.  Increased energy efficiency
and
renewable energy could play a significant role in meeting that increased
electrical
demand.  To than end, the Office of Utility Technologies (OUT) is working with
industry to improve the cost and performance of renewable energy technologies,
including photovoltaics, solar thermal power, biomass power, wind power,
hydroelectric power, and geothermal energy.  OUT encourages utility energy
efficiency by managing research in advanced transmission and distribution
technologies, high-temperature superconductivity, and energy storage, and by
supporting programs that promote integrated resource planning.  OUT is also
conducting research to evaluate the potential health effects of exposure to
low-
frequency electric and magnetic fields.
<p>
<b><i>The Office of Industrial Technologies</b></i><p>
<p>
Industry accounts for 37% of the energy we consume as a nation.  Virtually
every
manufacturing process uses more energy than necessary.   The Office of
Industrial
Technologies (OIT) collaborates with industry to improve the energy efficiency
and
productivity of industrial processes.  OIT manages programs to reduce energy
use
through new technologies in heat recovery, energy utilization, and industrial
and
municipal waste management.  Other programs develop process improvements and
innovations for specific energy-intensive industries such as pulp and paper,
steel, and
chemicals.  In addition, applied research in combustion, biotechnology,
advanced
materials, and heat transfer will provide the foundation for future advances in
technology.  An active technology transfer program provides an effective link
between
the research and development programs and the community of potential users.
<p>
<b><i>The Office of Transportation Technologies</b></i><p>
<p>
Transportation consumes more than 60% of the oil used in this country, and
almost
half of that oil is imported.  To reduce our nation's dependence on foreign oil
and
reduce the air pollution caused by gasoline-powered vehicles, the Office of
Transportation Technologies (OTT) supports research in electric and hybrid
vehicles;
fuel cells and other advanced power sources; alternative fuels made form
biomass and
other renewable energy sources; and advanced materials, such as
high-temperature
ceramics for gas-turbine and diesel engines.  OTT is a partner in the U.S.
Advanced
Battery Consortium -- composed of the three major U.S. automakers, leading
electric
utilities, and battery companies -- working to develop improved batteries for
electric
vehicles.  OTT is also establishing a database on the performance of
alternative-fueled
vehicles and is spearheading the purchase of such vehicles for the federal
fleet.
<p>
<b><i>Office of Building Technology, State, and Community Programs</b></i><p>
<p>
Residential and commercial buildings account for more than one-third of the
nation's
total energy use and consume about two-thirds of the nation's electricity.  The
Office
of Building Technologies (OBT) supports private sector efforts in the building
industry to improve energy efficiency and increase the use of renewable energy. 
OBT
supports basic and applied research on building systems and materials,
primarily
focusing the building envelope and the indoor environment and how they interact
in
determining energy performance.  Other OBT research activities focus on the
equipment that provides heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, hot water, and
other
services necessary for safe, efficient building operation.  OBT also fulfills
legislative
requirements for DOE to set energy efficiency standards for buildings and
household
appliances.
<p>
<b><i>Federal Energy Management Program</b></i><p>
<p>
As the central point of contact within the 100+ Federal agencies, the Federal
Energy Management Program (FEMP) leads an interagency and public/private
partnership to provide private sector financing mechanisms, training, audits
and technology demonstrations to help Federal agencies find their best
investments for saving energy, using renewable energy, and conserving water.
The cornerstone of its efforts is FEMP's development of partnerships between
government agencies and private companies.  The cost of Federal energy
efficiency projects is increasingly being offset with utility incentives and
financing from private energy service companies, which use "energy saving
performance contracts" to pay the up-front costs of efficiency improvements. 
The energy service companies are repaid for the cost of the project with a
share of the resulting energy savings.  A fully implemented FEMP program will
cut Federal energy bills by $1 billion during the next ten years.
