WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

As you probably already know, Congress has attached legislation to the
Telecommunications Deregulation bill that will criminalize much speech
on the Internet that may be considered "indecent" with a 2 year jail
term and a US$100,000 fine.  Online activists have been fighting to have
these provisions removed from the bill from Day 1.  Our latest thrust
has been to stall the passage of the bill, hoping to gather enough
support to have these provisions removed.

As you also probably already know, Congress broke for the year without
voting on the Telecommunications Deregulation bill.  Although net
activists should not take too much credit for this nonevent, our loud
objections to the language being tossed around in the Conference
committee certainly helped slow things down a bit.

We have bought ourselves some time, and now we must meet with our
legislators and explain to them why the Telecommunications Deregulation
bill will cripple the Internet as a medium for commerce, education, and
democracy.

We've done well so far in establishing ourselves and our concerns in
Washington DC.  We need to transform ourselves, evolve into the next
step in the political process and begin the face to face work that will
convince candidates that we vote, and our votes turn on the First
Amendment.

Make a New Year's resolution: vow to have a face to face meeting with
the staff of your local legislator.  Follow the directions below and
help become a part of the growing Internet Voter block.

1. Setup a meeting at the local office of your Congress-person.

   Sample phone call (a bit long for a call, but use it as a guide)

        Hi, I'm a constituent.

        The pending Telecommunications Reform bill contains a provision
        which, under the guise of protecting children from
        objectionable material on the Internet, will destroy the
        Internet as a viable medium for commerce, education, and
        democracy.  I believe that there are other, less restrictive
        ways to address this issue.

        I am very concerned about this issue, and I would like to come
        in and meet with someone in your office to talk about why this
        bill must not be passed in its current form. How soon can I
        schedule a meeting?

   If you don't know who your local legislator is, try these methods:

   League of Women Voters: In many cities you can call them and they will
        look up your legislator for you.
   Elections Board: Many cities allow you to look up your legislator by
        calling the local Elections board.
   The Zipper: Stardot Consulting has setup a Congressional lookup service
        called the Zipper, which lets you look up your legislator by entering
        your zipcode. URL:http://www.stardot.com/zipper/

   You can call the capitol switchboard at: 202 224-3121
   A list of phone numbers for Congress is available also at:
        URL:http://www.vtw.org/congress/

2. Tell us about your meeting, preferably before and after by sending us
   mail to feedback@vtw.org.  We will be keeping track of feedback to help
   coordinate lobbying efforts in DC if and when Congress votes on this issue.

        $ Mail feedback@vtw.org
        Subject: meeting setup with Rep. Snodgrass

        I've got a meeting scheduled with Rep. Snodgrass' staff on Tues.
        I'm taking the Internet Parental Control FAQ and will educate them
        about why these laws are not only unnecessary, but will not help
        control kids' access to the net!
        ^D

        $ Mail feedback@vtw.org
        Subject: my meeting with Rep. Snodgrass

        I just got back from my meeting with Snodgrass' staff.  It went well!
        They didn't know anything about the Internet, but I helped explain
        to them about parental control tools and the fact that current laws
        are *already* being enforced there, and they seemed to understand!
        ^D

3. Relax!  You have really done a lot to help the cause.

HOW TO SETUP A REALLY GOOD MEETING WITH CONGRESSIONAL STAFF

REMEMBER THE POINT OF THE MEETING
You must have a clear theme in the meeting.  Even if you say it and you
think it sounds corny, you don't want to leave a staffer guessing at what
you want.

The theme should be:

        The Telecom bill should not pass with the net censorship
        provisions in its current form.  House Speaker Gingrich and
        Senate Leader Dole have both expressed concern over these
        provisions.  Please work with them to protect free speech and
        the Internet.

It will help if you bring a personal Internet success story, such as
important medical information found on the net, children gets material
for school reports, car-owners talking to one another, camping tips,
consumer product information from companies, local library card
catalog, government information from CDC, Census, USDA, NASA, etc.

SCHEDULING THE MEETING
When you setup your meeting, do not overload the meeting.  It is better
to have a local office have three meetings with three people, rather
than one meeting with nine people.

A perfect meeting would include an Internet user, an Internet business
(like an Internet provider or another company that uses the net), and a
librarian.  Pick someone to be the MC so things progress smoothly.

If you're the only one going to the meeting, that is good too.  It's
better to go to the meeting alone, rather than have no meeting at all.

PREPARING FOR THE MEETING
Make sure you're familiar with the issues before going into the
meeting.  Take some time to read the Communications Decency Act FAQ
available from URL:http://www.vtw.org/pubs/cdafaq to get a sense of the
myths you may have to dispel during the meeting.  Also, become familiar
with, and take a copy of the VTW Internet Parental Control FAQ to back
up claims that there are many parental control devices out there that
allow parents to control what their children see on the Internet.  It
is available from URL:http://www.vtw.org/pubs/ipcfaq.

Are you ready?  Ask yourself if you know why no new laws are necessary
to control information on the Internet.

If the answer is that current laws about child porn and obscene
material extend there already, which, combined with parental control
tools, make such unconstitutional laws unnecessary, then you're ready.

RUNNING THE MEETING
Remember that most staffers know nothing about the Internet.  You'll have to
bring them up to speed on the net, as well as why the net needs no new laws.
It's crucial you be polite.  This is the first time they've met Internet
Voters, and first impressions count.

Dress appropriately, a jacket and tie are not out of the question.  Be very 
polite and patient.  Never raise your voice or utter the following phrases
during a meeting with a staffer:

        "I pay my taxes" or "You work for me, I'm a taxpayer"
         (We all pay taxes, this is moot)

        "I'll make sure you're not re-elected"
         (They haven't met that many Internet Voters yet to convince them
          this might be true)

Make sure everyone has a chance to speak, answer any questions they might
have, and then thank the staffer for their time.  Leave your name and number
so they can call you and ask you any questions they might think of later.

AFTER THE MEETING
Send a thank you letter (faxing it is appropriate).  Remember to let VTW
know that you had the meeting by sending email to feedback@vtw.org.

THE LATEST NEWS

Congress has broken for the year without a vote on the Telecomm bill.
We have been given the breathing room we sorely needed.  We must now
convince legislators to vote against the censorship legislation.

Just to refresh your memory, the House and Senate passed different pieces
of legislation which addressed regulation of the Internet.  Some of the
legislation promoted a "parental control" approach, where parents, not
the government, were the most appropriate to control children's access
to speech on the Internet. (This approach was called Cox/Wyden and was
approved 421-4 by the House)

Other proposals advocated dumbing down the content of the Internet to
that which is acceptable to children, and holding providers responsible
for the speech of their users.  These approaches were the Communications
Decency Act (S314 approved 84-16 by the Senate), and the Manager's Amendment
(slipped into the House Telecomm bill at the last second).

Although we are trying very hard to get an electronic copy of the conference
report, it's not fast in coming.  As soon as we can get a copy into electronic
form we'll put it up on several WWW pages.

In the meantime, here's a summary of what the bill looks like.

CRIMINALIZATION OF "INDECENT" MATERIAL
The proposed legislation relies on the unconstitutional "indecency standard". 
Like the Exon Communications Decency Act, it seeks to regulate all indecent
speech online.
 
Indecency is a broad category that may include everything from George Carlin's
"seven dirty words" to such classic novels and "The Catcher in the Rye",
"Lady Chatterly's Lover", "The Scarlet Letter", "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn",
"Our Bodies, Our Selves", Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet", and "Catch-22".
 
The Supreme Court has ruled that restrictions on indecent speech are 
Constitutional only if they rely on the "least restrictive means".  Broad
indecency restrictions on interactive media do not satisfy the "least
restrictive means" test, because interactive media allows users and
parents tremendous control over the information they receive.
 
The net effect of an indecency restriction would be to tone down every
conversation, web page, newsgroup, and mailing list on the Internet
to the level of what is not offensive to children. 

Even the Department of Justice, who will have to enforce this law once
it becomes public, says that the indecency standard is "constitutionally
problematic". (Letter from Andrew Fois of US DOJ to Rep. Howard Berman,
12/20/95)

CONTENT PROVIDERS, ONLINE SERVICES, AND LIBRARIES CRIMINALLY LIABLE FOR
 EXPRESSION ONLINE
Although the proposed legislation tries to hold harmless those who simply
function as "pipelines" for Internet access, there are many Internet
businesses who act as more than just access providers.  Hosting discussion
groups, chat rooms, and other additional services, many Internet providers
function as content providers as well as simple access providers.

On top of this, the rest of us who provide content on the net (which includes
everyone who sends mail, posts to Usenet, puts up a WWW page, maintains an
ftp directory, or a gopher page) will fall under the indecency law, and
be forced to screen our material and "dumb it down" to the level of what is
not offensive to a child.

This will include anything having to do with sexual abuse, abortion, or any
strong language.

"GOOD SAMARITAN" PROVISION REMAINS IN BILL
The original Cox/Wyden/White legislation included a "Good Samaritan"
provision which said that a provider who takes some actions to police
their content cannot be penalized for not taking action in other places.  

UNPRECEDENTED CONTROL OVER ONLINE SPEECH FOR THE FCC
The original Cox/Wyden/White bill prohibited FCC jurisdiction over the 
Internet.  This provision has been removed from the proposed legislation,
which now leaves the FCC open to make a case for regulating this new
medium.

The Internet has developed from a government project to a market-driven
economic boom for thousands of businesses.  Giving the FCC authority over
this medium would significantly hinder the growth of this new industry.

CHRONOLOGY OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT

Dec  7, '95     The House half of the Telecomm conference committee
                votes the "indecency" standard for online speech into
                the Telecomm Deregulation bill.
Sep 26, '95     Sen. Russ Feingold urges committee members to drop
                Managers Amendment and the CDA from the Telecommunications
                Deregulation bill
Aug  4, '95     House passes HR1555 which goes into conference with S652.
Aug  4, '95     House votes to attach Managers Amendment (which contains
                new criminal penalties for speech online) to
                Telecommunications Reform bill (HR1555).
Aug  4, '95     House votes 421-4 to attach HR1978 to Telecommunications
                Reform bill (HR1555).
Jun 30, '95     Cox and Wyden introduce the "Internet Freedom and Family
                Empowerment Act" (HR 1978) as an alternative to the CDA.
Jun 21, '95     Several prominent House members publicly announce their
                opposition to the CDA, including Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-GA),
                Rep. Chris Cox (R-CA), and Rep. Ron Wyden (D-OR).
Jun 14, '95     The Senate passes the CDA as attached to the Telecomm
                reform bill (S 652) by a vote of 84-16.  The Leahy bill
                (S 714) is not passed.
May 24, '95     The House Telecomm Reform bill (HR 1555) leaves committee
                in the House with the Leahy alternative attached to it,
                thanks to Rep. Ron Klink of (D-PA).  The Communications
                Decency Act is not attached to it.
Apr  7, '95     Sen. Leahy (D-VT) introduces S.714, an alternative to
                the Exon/Gorton bill, which commissions the Dept. of
                Justice to study the problem to see if additional legislation
                (such as the CDA) is necessary.
Mar 23, '95     S314 amended and attached to the telecommunications reform
                bill by Sen. Gorton (R-WA).  Language provides some provider
                protection, but continues to infringe upon email privacy
                and free speech.
Feb 21, '95     HR1004 referred to the House Commerce and Judiciary committees
Feb 21, '95     HR1004 introduced by Rep. Johnson (D-SD)
Feb  1, '95     S314 referred to the Senate Commerce committee

<h3>July 20, 1994 Letter from VP Gore to Rep. Maria Cantwell</h3>
<p>
<pre>
July 20, 1994

The Honorable Maria Cantwell
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C., 20515

Dear Representative Cantwell:

I write to express my sincere appreciation for your efforts to move the 
national debate forward on the issue of information security and export 
controls. I share your strong conviction for the need to develop a 
comprehensive policy regarding encryption, incorporating an export 
policy that does not disadvantage American software companies in world 
markets while preserving our law enforcement and national security 
goals. 

As you know, the Administration disagrees with you on the extent to 
which existing controls are harming U.S. industry in the short run and 
the extent to which their immediate relaxation would affect national 
security. For that reason we have supported a five-month Presidential 
study. In conducting this study, I want to assure you that the 
Administration will use the best available resources of the federal 
government. This will include the active participation of the National 
Economic Council and the Department of Commerce. In addition, consistent 
with the Senate-passed language, the first study will be completed 
within 150 days of passage of the Export Administration Act 
reauthorization bill, with the second study to be completed within one 
year after the completion of the first. I want to personally assure you 
that we will reassess our existing export controls based on the results 
of these studies. Moreover, all programs with encryption that can be 
exported today will continue to be exportable. 

On the other hand, we agree that we need to take action this year to 
assure that over time American companies are able to include information 
security features in their programs in order to maintain their admirable 
international competitiveness. We can achieve this by entering into an 
new phase of cooperation among government, industry representatives and 
privacy advocates with a goal of trying to develop a key escrow 
encryption system that will provide strong encryption, be acceptable to 
computer users worldwide, and address our national needs as well. 

Key escrow encryption offers a very effective way to accomplish our 
national goals, That is why the Administration adopted key escrow 
encryption in the "Clipper Chip" to provide very secure encryption for 
telephone communications while preserving the ability for law 
enforcement and national security. But the Clipper Chip is an approved 
federal standard for telephone communications and not for computer 
networks and video networks. For that reason, we are working with 
industry to investigate other technologies for those applications. 

The Administration understands the concerns that industry has regarding 
the Clipper Chip. We welcome the opportunity to work with industry to 
design a more versatile, less expensive system. Such a key escrow system 
would be implementable in software, firmware, hardware, or any 
combination thereof, would not rely upon a classified algorithm, would 
be voluntary, and would be exportable. While there are many severe 
challenges to developing such a system, we are committed to a diligent 
effort with industry and academia to create such a system. We welcome 
your offer to assist us in furthering this effort. 

We also want to assure users of key escrow encryption products that they 
will not be subject to unauthorized electronic surveillance. As we have 
done with the Clipper Chip, future key escrow systems must contain 
safeguards to provide for key disclosure only under legal authorization 
and should have audit procedures to ensure the integrity of the system. 
Escrow holders should be strictly liable for releasing keys without 
legal authorization.

We also recognize that a new key escrow encryption system must permit 
the use of private-sector key escrow agents as one option. It is also 
possible that as key escrow encryption technology spreads, companies may 
established layered escrowing services for their own products. Having a 
number of escrow agents would give individuals and businesses more 
choices and flexibility in meeting their needs for secure 
communications. 

I assure you the President and I are acutely aware of the need to 
balance economic an privacy needs with law enforcement and national 
security. This is not an easy task, but I think that our approach offers 
the best opportunity to strike an appropriate balance. I am looking 
forward to working with you and others who share our interest in 
developing a comprehensive national policy on encryption. I am convinced 
that our cooperative endeavors will open new creative solutions to this 
critical problem.

Sincerely,

Al Gore

AG/gcs

<PRE>


   February 9, 1996

   Honorable Albert Gore, Jr.
   President of the Senate
   United States Senate
   Washington, DC 20510

   Dear Mr. President:

   On February 7, 1996, a lawsuit was filed challenging the
   constitutionality of a provision of 18 U.S.C. 1462, as amended by
   section 507(a) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Sanger, et al v.
   Reno, Civ. No. 96-0526 (E.D.N.Y.). Yesterday, a second lawsuit was
   filed, raising the same challenge to 1462 along with claims that
   several other provisions of the Telecommunications Act are
   unconstitutional. American Civil Liberties Union, et al v. Reno, Civ.
   No. 96-963 (E.D. Pa,). This letter was relates solely to the claims
   regarding 1462, as amended. Plaintiffs in both cases allege that 1462,
   as amended, violates the First Amendment insofar as it prohibits the
   interstate transmission of certain communications regarding abortion
   via common carrier or via an interactive computer service.

   This is to inform you that the Department of Justice will not defend
   the constitutionality of the abortion-related speech provision of 1462
   in those cases, in light of the Department's longstanding policy to
   decline to enforce the abortion-related speech prohibitions in 1462
   (and in related statutes, i.e., 18 U.S.C. 1461 and 39 U.S.C. 3001)
   because they are unconstitutional under the First Amendment.

   In 1981, Attorney General Civiletti informed the Speaker of the House
   and the President of the Senate that it was the policy of the
   Department of Justice to refrain from enforcing similar speech
   prohibitions in two cognate statutes--39 U.S.C. 3001 and 18 U.S.C.
   1461--with respect to "cases of truthful and non-deceptive documents
   containing information on how to obtain a lawful abortion." Letter of
   Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti to the Hon. Thomas P. O'Neill,
   Jr., at 2 (Jan 13, 1981). According to the Attorney General, there was
   "no doubt" that those statutes were unconstitutional as applied to
   such speech. Id at 1. The Attorney General left open the possibility
   that the two statutes might still be applied to certain
   abortion-related commercial speech. Id at 3.

   Two years later, the Supreme Court held that 3001 cannot
   constitutionally be applied to commercial speech concerning
   contraception at least not where the speech in question is truthful
   and not misleading. Bolger v. Youngs Drug and Product Corp., 463 U.S.
   60 (1983). The holding in Bolger would apply equally with respect to
   abortion-related commercial speech. See Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S.
   809 (1975).

   Section 1462 is subject to the same constitutional defect as 1461 and
   3001 with respect to its application to abortion-related speech and
   information. (1) As a result of the Department's conclusion that
   prosecution of abortion-related speech under 1462 and related statutes
   would violate the First Amendment, the Department's longstanding
   policy has been to decline to enforce those statutes with respect to
   that speech. What is more, we are not aware of any reported decision
   reflecting a prosecution of abortion-related speech under 1462.

   Nothing in the Telecommunications Act provides any reason to alter the
   Department of Justice's nonenforcement policy. In his signing
   statement yesterday, the President stated:

   "I...object to the provision in the Act concerning the transmittal of
   abortion-related speech and information. Current law, 18 U.S.C. 1462,
   prohibits transmittal of this information by certain means, and the
   Act would extend that law to cover transmittal by interactive computer
   services. The Department of Justice had advised me of its longstanding
   policy that this and related abortion provisions in current law are
   unconstitutional and will not be enforced because they violate the
   First
   Amendment. The Department has reviewed this provision of S. 652 and
   advised me that it provides no basis for altering that policy.
   Therefore, the Department will continue to decline to enforce that
   provision of current law, amended by this legislation, as applied to
   abortion-related speech."

   The principal function of 1462 is to prohibit the interstate carriage
   of "obscene, lewd, lascivious...filthy...[and] indecent" materials.
   See 1462(a). The Supreme Court has construed this prohibition to be
   limited to materials that meet the test of "obscenity" announced in
   Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973). (2) Congress's express
   purpose in enacting the amendment to 1462 in Telecommunications Act
   507 was to "clarify[]" that obscene materials cannot be transmitted
   interstate via interactive computer services. (3) In this respect,
   1462 and its amendment in 507 are constitutionally unobjectionable,
   and the Department will continue to enforce 1462 with respect to the
   transmittal of obscenity.

   However, 1462 also prohibits the interstate transmission of certain
   communications regarding abortion. As amended by 507 of the
   Telecommunications Act, 1462 provides, in pertinent part, that is
   shall be a felony to

   "knowingly use any express company or other common carrier or
   interactive computer service..., for carriage in interstate or foreign
   commerce (of)...

   (c) any...written or printed card, letter, circular, book, pamphlet,
   advertisement, or notice of any kind giving information, directly or
   indirectly, where, how, or of whom, or by what means any [drug,
   medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or intended for
   producing abortion] may be obtained or made."

   Thus, on its face, 1462 prohibits the use of an interactive computer
   service for "carriage in interstate...commerce" of any information
   concerning "any drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted,
   or intended for producing abortion." (4)

   It plainly would be unconstitutional to enforce 1462 with respect to
   speech or information concerning abortion, because the restriction on
   abortion-related speech is impermissibly content based. This
   conclusion is confirmed by the judicial and Executive Branch treatment
   of similar prohibitions on speech concerning abortion and
   contraception, contained in two cognate statutes, 39 U.S.C. 3001 and
   18 U.S.C. 1461. Section 3001 provides that abortion- and
   contraception-related speech is "nonmailable"; and 1461 makes such
   mailings subject to criminal sanctions. In 1972, a district court
   declared that 3001 was unconstitutional insofar as it rendered
   abortion-related speech "nonmailable." Atlanta Coop. News Project v.
   United States Postal Service, 350 F. Supp. 234, 238-39 (N.D. Ga. 1972)
   The next year, another district court declared both 3001 and 1461
   unconstitutional as applied to noncommercial speech concerning
   abortion and contraception. Associated Students for Univ. of
   California at Riverside v. Attorney General, 368 F. Supp. 11, 21-24
   (C.D. Calif 1973). As the Attorney General later explained to the
   Congress, the Solicitor General declined to appeal the decisions in
   Atlanta Coop. News Project and Associated Students "on the grounds
   that 18 U.S.C. 1461 and 39 U.S.C. 3001(e) were unconstitutionally
   indefensible" as applied to abortion-related speech. See Letter of
   Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti to the Hon. Thomas P. O'Neill,
   Jr., at 2 (Jan 13, 1981). And, as explained above, in 1981 the
   Attorney
   General informed the Congress that the Department of Justice would
   decline to enforce 1461 and 3001 in cases of truthful and
   non-deceptive documents containing information on how to obtain a
   lawful abortion.

   Nothing in recent Supreme Court law respecting the First Amendment has
   affected the conclusions reached by the district courts in Atlanta
   Copp. News Project and Associated Students, the 1981 opinion of
   Attorney General Civiletti, or the Supreme Court's decision in Bolger.
   Indeed, the Supreme Court on several recent occasions has strongly
   reaffirmed the principle that the First Amendment, subject only to
   narrow and well-understood governmental control over the content of
   messages expressed by private individuals." Turner Broadcasting
   System, Inc. v. FCC, 114 S.C. 2445, 2456-59 (1994) (citing R.A.V. v.
   City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 (1992); Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397
   (1989)).

   In the Ganger case, Judge Sifton yesterday denied plaintiffs' motions
   for a temporary restraining order after the United States Attorney
   represented that the Department's policy is to decline to enforce the
   pertinent provisions of 1462. Judge Sifton further ruled that a
   three-judge court hearing on any dispositive motions will be convened
   next month, after briefing. In the ACLU case before Judge Buckwalter,
   the Government is due to respond to a motion for a TRO on February 14,
   1996. In accordance with the practice of the Department, I am
   informing the Congress that in neither case will the Department of
   Justice defend the constitutionality of the provision 1462 that
   prohibits speech concerning abortion.

   Sincerely,

   Janet Reno

Date:  April 29, 1996
                           INTRODUCTION
          Now that the evidence has been submitted, it is clear
there are remarkably few disagreements regarding the facts
material to resolution of plaintiffs' motions for preliminary
relief.  The essential facts regarding the nature of the
Internet, the nature of plaintiffs' speech, and the capabilities
of various parental control devices to block or filter speech
that might be inappropriate for minors, are largely undisputed.
          Based on this record, plaintiffs are entitled to
preliminary relief enjoining enforcement of the challenged
provisions of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 ("CDA" or
"Act").[1]  As we argued in our pre-hearing memorandum,[2] and as
the evidence now confirms, the CDA effectively bans an enormous
quantity of speech that is constitutionally protected for adults,
because the "safe harbor" defenses provided in the Act do not
provide technologically or economically feasible means for
plaintiffs, their members and patrons, or for most Internet
speakers, to shield themselves from liability.  Defendants, in
response, have attempted to avoid consideration of the CDA's
actual impact on plaintiffs' speech, because they cannot justify
that actual impact in view of the long line of Supreme Court
precedents holding that government is not permitted to reduce the
adult population to reading and viewing only what is appropriate
for children.[3]   Yet that is precisely what Congress did here,
and that is why the CDA must be enjoined.

                        STATEMENT OF FACTS
          The facts are set forth in the Combined Proposed
Findings of Fact of the ACLU and ALA Plaintiffs (April 29,
1996)("Pl. Pro. Find."), submitted herewith.  The "key" proposed
facts can be found at paragraphs 1 through 18.  

                        SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
          The evidence shows that the CDA effectively bans a
broad range of speech by plaintiffs and their members and patrons
that might be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" for
minors but is fully constitutionally protected for adults.  For
some modes of online communication, e.g., newsgroups, there is
simply no way to comply with the Act.  As to other methods of
communication, those who wish to make their speech available to
the world, and for free, cannot use the "verified credit card"
defense specified in the CDA, and there is no other practical way
for them to screen out potential listeners who are minors.  Pl.
Pro. Find. Part IV.C.1.  Even if they could, the difficulties of
determining which material is actually subject to the Act, and
segregating that material, are virtually insurmountable.  Pl.
Pro. Find. Part IV.C.1.b.(1), IV.D.  As a result, if they wish to
engage in speech potentially covered by the Act, they risk
prosecution under the Act, which makes it a felony to use
interactive computer services "to display" "patently offensive"
speech "in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age." 
47 U.S.C.  223 (d)(1)(B).  As a practical matter, the Act thus
forces plaintiffs and their members and patrons to self-censor
any non-obscene speech that might be deemed patently offensive
for minors, even though all of that speech is fully
constitutionally protected for adults.
          The evidence also shows that such a ban on "patently
offensive" speech between adults is not necessary to protect
minors because parental control software, and other user-based
methods, enable adults to block access to that speech by minors. 
Pl. Pro. Find. Part III.F, IV.F.3.  The Government's expert
witness acknowledged, for example, that PICS technology enables
parents to block access by their children to all Internet speech
that has not been approved for minors by a third-party rating
bureau the parent trusts, without depriving the parent, or any
other adult, of access to that very same speech.  Olsen Test.,
Tr. Vol. IV, at 221:19 to 222:24.  The parental control features
offered by the major online service providers and by private
software companies also enable parents to block or filter the
material available to their children, without depriving any adult
of access to that same material.  Pl. Pro. Find. Part III.F.2, 3. 
          The evidence also shows that the CDA will not protect
minors from the substantial percentage of indecent or patently
offensive speech that is posted abroad, whereas the user-based
methods plaintiffs advocate would block such speech regardless of
where it was posted.  Pl. Pro. Find. Part III.E.2.c, IV.F. 
Indeed, the Government's expert candidly volunteered that "we
would have to rely upon SurfWatch or Net Nanny technology for
foreign speakers."  Olsen Test., Tr. Vol. V, at 44:14-16.
          In short, the CDA will not be effective in protecting
minors from the significant percentage of indecent or patently
offensive speech posted abroad, and seeks to protect minors from
indecent or patently offensive speech posted domestically only by
banning that speech between adults as well.  In contrast, the
parental control technology the free market has developed without
governmental involvement would be more effective in protecting
minors from indecent or patently offensive speech, without
banning any of that speech between adults.
          Given these realities, defendants have not seriously
attempted to defend the constitutionality of the CDA as written. 
Instead, they have labored to craft and urge judicial adoption of
a quite different statute, which bears no resemblance to the
statute Congress enacted, and is actually contrary to the policy
choices reflected in the CDA.  Defendants argue, for example,
that the CDA was only (or primarily) intended to prohibit speech
by commercial entities distributing pornography that lacks
serious value.  But those arguments flatly ignore the text of the
CDA, its legislative history, and the Supreme Court precedent on
which Congress expressly relied.  
          When all is said and done, the Court is confronted with
a hastily drafted statute (the key provision of which -- "display
in a manner available" -- was added, without hearings, by the
Conference Committee) that fails to take account of the unique
nature of the Internet, and obviously sweeps far more broadly
than the First Amendment permits.  Defendants offer no plausible
construction that would narrow the statute's sweep in a
definitive and constitutionally permissible way.  Instead, they
essentially invite this Court to decide what can be done
constitutionally and what should be done, as a policy matter, and
then to rewrite the statute accordingly.  The appropriate
response, however, is to strike this statute down and give
Congress the opportunity to make those policy choices itself.
          Even if the CDA could withstand the strict First
Amendment scrutiny to which it must be subjected -- and it cannot
-- the challenged provisions would have to be struck down because
they are fatally vague in violation of the Fifth Amendment. 
Speakers cannot be forced to guess what constitutes prohibited
speech and what actions they must take to afford themselves of
the CDA's defenses.  But this is precisely the position in which
plaintiffs, their members and patrons find themselves.  The
evidence produced by defendants has only exacerbated the
ambiguity inherent in the CDA's use of the "indecency" and
"patently offensive" standards, and its nebulous "good faith"
defense.  The Fifth Amendment does not permit defendants to force
speakers to rely upon the good intentions of prosecutors in order
to avoid criminal liability for engaging in constitutionally
protected speech.

                             ARGUMENT
I.   THE CDA VIOLATES THE FIRST AMENDMENT BECAUSE IT EFFECTIVELY
     BANS A SUBSTANTIAL CATEGORY OF PROTECTED SPEECH FROM MOST
     PARTS OF THE INTERNET.

          The CDA effectively bans a broad but vaguely defined
category of protected speech from most parts of the Internet. 
Defendants have not demonstrated that this abridgment of the
First Amendment rights of speakers and their audiences directly
and materially serves any compelling governmental interest in the
least restrictive way.  Nor has the Government shown that the
Act's burdens on the rights of adults are outweighed by its
benefits to minors.  The Act is therefore plainly
unconstitutional.  See ALA P.I. Mem. at 25-42.
     A.   The Government Has Failed To Prove There Is Any
          Practical Way For Most Speakers To Transmit Speech That
          Is Potentially Covered By The Act.

          The key provision of the CDA challenged here, 47 U.S.C.
 223(d)(1)(B), makes it a felony to use an "interactive computer
service to display in a manner available to . . . person[s] under
18 years of age" any communication that "in context, depicts or
describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by
contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities
or organs."[4]  Defendants have never contended that this
provision, standing alone, would be constitutional.  That is not
surprising, because subsection (d), by itself, would effectively
eliminate constitutionally protected but "patently offensive"
speech from the Internet.  With the possible exception of private
e-mail to a known recipient, no method of communicating over the
Internet can be used with assurance that the message will not be
"available" to persons under age 18.  Pl. Pro. Find. Part
IV.C.1.a.  
          Instead, defendants' case hinges on the proposition
that the Act, taken as a whole, does not ban constitutionally
protected speech between adults -- i.e., that the defenses set
forth in section 223(e) make it feasible for would-be speakers to
use the Internet to transmit "patently offensive" speech to
adults.[5]  The key question, therefore, is whether the subsection
(e) defenses eliminate the otherwise unconstitutional sweep of
subsection (d).  In other words, it is undisputed that subsection
(d), by itself, is not a narrowly tailored law.  The Government
argues that subsection (e) narrows the sweep of subsection (d)
sufficiently that the Act as a whole becomes constitutional.  But
the Government has utterly failed to meet its burden of proving
that the subsection (e) defenses are in fact available to most 
Internet speakers.[6]  For that reason, the Government's defense
of the Act fails.  
     1.   Screening using credit cards and access codes is
          impossible for many speakers and is not a practical
          option for most other speakers.
     
          Section 223(e)(5)(B) provides a defense to conviction
for speakers who can screen prospective recipients "by requiring
use of a verified credit card, debit account, adult access code,
or adult personal identification number."  All the parties'
experts agreed, however, that this defense is not available for
several important modes of online communication.  Scott Bradner
testified that a speaker posting to a newsgroup, mail exploder
(e.g., listserv or Majordomo), or IRC chat channel (the most
predominant form of Internet "real time" chat) has no control
over who receives the communication and, in normal usage, does
not even know who the recipients will be.[7]  Accordingly, Bradner
testified that credit card and adult access code screening is
technologically infeasible for these modes of communication; it
is impossible for the speaker to screen recipients to ensure they
are over 17 years of age.[8]  Dan Olsen, the Government's expert
agreed.[9]  Thus, it is undisputed that requiring such screening
for any messages that might be "indecent" or "patently offensive"
for a minor would have the effect of banning such messages from
these types of online communication.  Pl. Pro. Find. Part IV.B.
          Even as to other modes of communication, including the
World Wide Web, where the defense is arguably technologically
feasible, defendants implicitly concede that this screening
method is only practicable for speakers who operate "'commercial'
adult sites that can take credit cards or devise access codes." 
US ALA Resp. at 17 (emphasis added).  For everyone else
attempting to communicate over the Internet -- including
individuals or entities who have non-commercial Web sites and, in
general, all those who seek to communicate in cyberspace for
reasons other than profit -- screening based on credit cards or
access codes is a practical impossibility.  Pl. Pro. Find. Part
IV.C.1.b.  
          This conclusion was confirmed by several trial
witnesses.  Scott Bradner testified, and defendants did not
dispute, that effective online screening of recipients is not
currently possible.  Bradner Test. Decl.  71.  Verification can
be accomplished only "offline."  However, the cost is so
substantial that offline verification is practical only for a
commercial entity that is charging for access to its
communications.  Id.; Pl. Pro. Find. Part IV.C.1.b.2.  Indeed,

online transactions.  Anker Test. Decl.  21; Croneberger Test.

          Thus, most World Wide Web speakers are left with the
option of adult access code screening.  But the administrative
burden of creating and maintaining the screening system, and the
ongoing costs for verification services, put this method beyond
the reach of most speakers.  Bradner Test. Decl.  71; Anker
Test. Decl.  13 (estimated cost of developing HotWired's member
registration and recognition system, which is not able to screen
for age, is at least $40,000, with ongoing maintenance costs of
$400 to $1000 a week).  Anker testified that the expense of
third-party adult access code verification would threaten the
financial viability even of a popular and well-established Web
site like HotWired.  Anker Test. Decl.  22-23 (estimating costs
of age verification for its current 300,000 subscribers at
$600,000, plus $2 for each new subscriber and $0.29 for every
individual access to the site).  Croneberger testified that it
would require 65 additional staff members to pre-register and
maintain data files just for the county population that has
physical access to The Carnegie Library, at an annual cost of
$845,000.  Croneberger Test. Decl.  29.  Since the library's Web
site is available to anyone in the world, the library would need
to maintain a 24-hour staff to adequately serve all users of its
site, at significant additional costs.  Id.  30.  Indeed,
Croneberger indicated that the library's new state-of-the-art
technology system, which cost $10 million, simply could not
handle the registration of all the individuals whom they know
visit their site.  Id.  37.
          HotWired's experience with a voluntary, unverified
registration system also shows that user resistance to
registration and verification requirements would substantially
reduce the number of subscribers to an online publication,
reducing in turn its value to advertisers.  Anker Test. Decl.
 16; Anker Test., Tr. Vol. III, at 109:13 to 110:7.
          Finally, a registration requirement would destroy a
principal advantage of the Internet as a medium of communication: 
the ability of Internet users to research and communicate
seamlessly and without interruption across its vast variety of
available resources.[10]
          In any event, even if speakers such as HotWired or the
Carnegie Library could use credit cards or access codes to screen
recipients of their speech, they would still face the more
general problem of deciding which speech falls within the scope
of subsection (d) and thus may only be displayed to a pre-
screened audience of adults.  At the hearing, the testimony of
the Government's own witnesses reflected the difficulty of
deciding which speech is covered and which is not.  See Point II
infra (demonstrating that this vagueness renders the Act
unconstitutional in every application).  
          And even if speakers could determine which material is
covered by the Act, the burden of reviewing existing and future
material and categorizing it as either restricted or unrestricted
would be overwhelming for any speaker who engages in a
significant amount of online speech, and insurmountable for many
of those speakers.  Croneberger testified, for example, that it
would cost $30,000 just to purchase or create software that could
search Carnegie Library's online materials for "key words" that
could indicate material that might be deemed "indecent" or
"patently offensive."  Croneberger Test. Decl.  31.  And, as the
Government's expert agreed, such key word searches could not
ensure that all covered material was located; that task would
require human review and judgment.  Olsen Test., Tr. Vol. V, at
35:24 to 36:19, 40:7-20.[11]  Croneberger estimated that it would
require 180 staff members, at a cost of $3 million, to review the
over 2 million items in the library's catalog.  Croneberger Test.
Decl.  32.  And it would cost an additional $100,000 annually to
review the online information concerning the thousands of titles
the library adds to its collection.  Id.  33.  Monitoring and
reviewing the magazines and abstracts the library provides online
would cost an additional $625,000 annually.  Id.  35. 
Croneberger testified that there simply is no way for the library
to allocate or raise these funds.  Id.  42.  If the cost is
"economically infeasible for the Carnegie Library," as
Croneberger testified, "the costs simply could not be borne by
smaller libraries with smaller budgets."  Id.  44.
          2.   The Government has not demonstrated that there is
               any other defense available to online speakers.

          The only other defense for a content provider is set
forth in section 223(e)(5)(A), which applies where a content
provider "has taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective, and
appropriate actions under the circumstances to restrict or
prevent access by minors."[12]  Nothing in the statutory text or
legislative history lends meaning to this defense.  The
Government has identified no method by which a speaker can comply
with subsection (e)(5)(A).  The most the Government has been
willing to say, through the testimony of its expert witness, Dan
Olsen, is that some sort of "speaker tagging" system might
constitute a safe-harbor defense at some point in the future. 
But it has pointedly refused to specify that speaker tagging will
constitute a defense, either now or in the future.[13]
          That refusal is not surprising, because speaker tagging
plainly is not a defense today, and, even down the road, speaker
tagging alone could not be viewed as a "reasonable, effective,
and appropriate action" that would prevent the tagged speech from
being "available" to minors.  For these reasons, the Government's
tagging evidence is irrelevant, and does not rebut plaintiffs'
showing that the CDA effectively bans covered speech on the
Internet by all speakers who are unable to use the subsection
(e)(5)(B) credit card or adult access code defense.   
          At the hearing, the Government's expert testified that
different types of communications -- from Web sites to e-mail --
could be labelled with the expression "-L18" if they contain
speech covered by the Act.  But his testimony did not explain how
such tagging could constitute a defense.  Tagging alone could
never be a defense.  Indeed, Olsen acknowledged that a speaker's
mere act of tagging or labeling expression -- with "-L18," or
"xxx," or anything else -- does not restrict or prevent minors
from gaining access.  Olsen Testimony, Tr. Vol IV, at 211:8-11,
234:19-25.[14]  Tagging could not even arguably constitute a
defense under the Act unless it is effective in making the tagged
communication unavailable to minors, and the Government's expert
acknowledged that tagging cannot be effective without cooperative
filtering software on the receiving end.  Olsen Test., Tr. Vol
IV, at 209:25 to 210:6.  Since the Government's expert
acknowledges that tagging will be ineffective without the
"cooperation of entities down the communication pipeline," Olsen
Test., Tr. Vol. 5, at 42:10-14, speakers surely cannot rely on
tagging as a safe harbor defense unless and until those entities
cooperate.  And they are not required to cooperate.  To the
contrary, as Olsen acknowledged, "Congress made a considered
decision to impose no requirements on entities down the
communications chain."  Id. at 43:1-4; see id. at 42:15-18; Conf.
Rep. at 190 (no liability on access providers).
          It is undisputed that, today, the necessary cooperation
does not exist.  At present, there is not even common
understanding of what "tag" should be used to denominate indecent
or patently offensive material, and in most computers there is no
software in place that is configured to read tags that indicate a
particular communication is for adults only.  Olsen Test., Tr.
Vol. V, at 91:1-2; Bradner Test. Decl.  79.  Accordingly,
speaker tagging cannot possibly be a safe-harbor defense today.
          Moreover, even if, in the future, there is common
agreement on what tags to use, and most computers have software
that is capable of recognizing those tags, the plain terms of the
Act would still preclude any potential speaker from relying with
confidence on speaker tagging as a defense.  Some "tagged"
communications would still be "available" to minors, since it is
certain that some minors will have access to computers that do
not have the screening software installed, and turned on.  See
Olsen Test., Tr. Vol. V, at 17:14-22, 43:12-20 (acknowledging
that not all Web browsers would be configured to read tags). 
Accordingly, speakers would still have to guess whether their
tagging would constitute a "reasonable, effective, and
appropriate action[]" to prevent access by minors, within the
meaning of subsection (e)(5)(A), and will be forced to self-
censor based on well-grounded fears of prosecution.
          Nor can the Court solve this problem by construing the
statute to mean that a speaker's tagging of indecent speech will
be a complete defense.  It would be strange indeed for a court to
adopt a construction the Government steadfastly refuses to urge,
and Congress could have stated expressly if that was what it
wanted.  More importantly, such a construction would not save the
Act, for several independent reasons.
          First, for the reasons just stated, the Act cannot be
construed as providing a speaker tagging defense today, because
the necessary common understandings and software are not in
place.[15]  Second, a judicially recognized tagging defense would
not deal with the vagueness of subsection (d).  Speakers would
still be at a loss to know precisely when their speech crosses
the line and must be tagged.  Third, they would also face the
burden, insurmountable for many speakers, of segregating
regulated from unregulated speech -- even assuming the line
between the two could be discerned.  See Pl. Pro. Find. Part
IV.C.1.b.(1).
          In any event, a construction of the Act to the effect
that non-commercial speakers can engage in protected but
"patently offensive" speech only by self-labeling that speech
would raise additional First Amendment problems.  Any de jure or
de facto requirement that speakers label their own protected
speech "patently offensive" would amount to a pernicious form of
governmentally compelled speech.  The Government generally cannot
compel citizens to speak, particularly if the speaker is
compelled to attach a pejorative label the speaker does not
believe is warranted.  See Post-Trial Brief of ACLU Plaintiffs in
Support of Their Motion for a Preliminary Injunction ("ACLU Post-
Trial Br.") at 54-58.  Cf. Meese v. Keene, 481 U.S. 465, 483
(1987) (upholding mandatory labelling scheme in part on ground
that label in question was not "pejorative").  See, e.g., Riley
v. National Federation of the Blind, Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 797-800
(1988) (striking down under compelled speech doctrine requirement
that professional fundraisers disclose to potential donors
proportion of proceeds actually passed through to charity; noting
that compelled disclosure, whether of fact or opinion, "burdens
protected speech"); Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 715 (1977)
(law requiring individuals to display patriotic message on
license plates violated the First Amendment "right of individuals
to hold a point of view different from the majority").  Such
compelled speech is particularly unwarranted here, where the free
market has developed a technology -- PICS -- that does not
require speakers to label their speech, because their speech can
be rated by private third parties selected by parents.[16]  
          In any event, the CDA does not lend itself to a
construction that it merely requires speaker tagging.  Although
courts can construe statutes to avoid or eliminate constitutional
defects, the statute must be "readily susceptible" to a narrowing
construction.  See Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 484
U.S. 383, 397 (1988); Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205,
216 n.15 (1975).  The Supreme Court recently rejected an
invitation to "redraft" a statute to preserve possibly legitimate
applications.  See United States v. National Treasury Employees
Union, 115 S. Ct. 1003, 1019 (1995)("NTEU").  That task, the
Court concluded, would involve complex policy judgments and might
raise distinct constitutional concerns, and was therefore
"properly left to Congress."  Id.  
          If this Court were to attempt to rewrite the CDA as a
tagging law, it would have to make several quintessentially
legislative judgments.  It would be required, for example, to
determine empirically when the availability and use of blocking
software was sufficiently widespread to justify the conclusion
that speaker tagging would effectively make the tagged speech
unavailable to minors.[17]  And it would also have to determine
what kind of tagging would qualify for the defense.  These are
not matters a court should be resolving in the guise of
interpreting the general language of the CDA.  If Congress wants
to require, or approve as sufficient, tagging of a category of
protected speech, it should say so specifically -- rather than
passing a law that forces speakers to guess whether tagging would
be a "reasonable, effective, and appropriate" means of making
speech unavailable to minors, or forces courts to legislate all
the critical details. 
          Thus, the Government's effort to defend the CDA by
pointing to the mere possibility that speaker tagging "might"
provide a defense is wholly unpersuasive.  It follows that the
Act does operate -- today and for the foreseeable future -- as a
ban on a category of protected speech for most speakers.    
     B.   The Impact Of This Ban On Protected Speech Is Enormous.

          Contrary to the Government's claims, the effects of the
Act will extend far beyond "commercial" purveyors of
"pornography."  See generally ALA P.I. Mem. at 10-16.  Unlike the
dial-a-porn restrictions upon which the CDA is purportedly
modeled, the CDA is not expressly limited to commercial speakers
-- those who charge listeners a fee to obtain their speech.[18] 
To the contrary, the Conference Report confirms that Congress
intended "content regulation of both commercial and non-
commercial providers."[19]
          The Act also plainly applies to a far wider range of
speech than "pornography."  It is expressly made applicable to
"libraries and educational institutions."  47 U.S.C.  230(e)(2). 
As the evidence demonstrated, libraries are unlikely to carry (or
post online) even the illustrations from Playboy magazine, let
alone the hard-core material the Government claims is the
principal target of the Act.  See Croneberger Test., Tr. Vol. II,
at 105:21 to 106:5, 108:14-19. 
          The breadth of the expression covered by the Act is
apparent from the actual standard Congress chose to use in
subsection (d).  The "patently offensive" standard is a term of
art, coined by the FCC in its regulation of broadcast "indecency"
and discussed by the Supreme Court in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,
438 U.S. 726 (1978).  Conf. Rep. at 188-89.[20]  This
Pacifica/patent offensiveness standard bars broadcast of a great
deal of expression that by no stretch of the imagination would
constitute pornography.  For example, the FCC has suggested an
indirect "rule of thumb" that R-rated movies are indecent.[21] 
And Pacifica itself involved crude language, not pornography. 
          Significantly, the "patently offensive" standard is
also broad enough to include not only graphic "depictions" but
textual "descriptions" of sexual or excretory activities.  The
inclusion of written text vastly expands the potential scope of
subsection (d), and shows that Congress was interested in more
than conventional "pornography."  Indeed, Pacifica itself
involved only words, not images.  Under this standard, it is
reasonable for speakers to fear that any communication containing
some or all of the "seven dirty words" that is "available" to
minors on the Internet now constitutes a felony.[22]  And the
danger is just as great that a combination of seemingly innocuous
words will be deemed "patently offensive" "in context."  See
Olsen Test., Tr. Vol. V, at 36:20 to 37:2 (acknowledging that
combinations of words may render otherwise innocuous text
"offensive").
          Nothing in the "patently offensive" standard prevents
its application to works with serious value.  The broad purpose
of that standard when first adopted was to prohibit images or
descriptions of sexual or excretory activities or organs that
might be deemed inappropriate for children in over-the-air
broadcasts, even if they had serious value.  Acknowledging that
broad purpose, the FCC has ruled, in the broadcast context, that
material may be found patently offensive even where the
information is presented "in the news" and is presented "in a
serious, newsworthy manner."  Letter to Merrell Hansen, 6 FCC
Rcd. 3689 (1990)(citation omitted).  It has expressly declined to
hold that "if a work has merit, it is per se not indecent." 
Id.[23]  Moreover, that standard does not require consideration of
the material as a whole.[24]  By adopting that standard, Congress
has now decreed it is a felony to offer comparable forms of
expression on the Internet.
          Not surprisingly, plaintiffs' trial witnesses expressed
serious concern that the Act could be applied to criminalize
their online posting of textual materials containing the seven
dirty words or discussing sexual matters.  Croneberger Test.
Decl.  16-18, 21-22; Anker Test. Decl.  4, 5, 8.  The
Government's witnesses confirmed the validity of those fears.    
Howard Schmidt (who according to the Government was called to
demonstrate that images subject to the Act could be accessed on
the Internet) utilized several images containing nothing more
than partial or total nudity.[25]  Schmidt testified that, in some
parts of the country, the publisher of Vanity Fair would have
potential liability under the Act for posting online a cover
picture of a naked Demi Moore (even though the print publication
of that image was entirely lawful).  See Schmidt Test., Tr. Vol.
IV, at 138:23 to 139:14.  Dan Olsen, in turn, acknowledged that
any use of "dirty words" might be covered -- stating that each
such use should be tagged just to be sure.  Olsen Test., Tr. Vol
V, at 53:16 to 54:10.  He added that if he were the relevant
"community," a Playboy centerfold would be deemed indecent and
patently offensive.  Olsen Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 235:9 to
236:14.
          As with "tagging," the Government appears to be
inviting this Court to rewrite the CDA to regulate only
"pornography" that lacks serious value.  But that would require
the Court to perform radical surgery on the statutory language,
and would be contrary to the evident intent of Congress.[26] 
Courts have no "license to rewrite a statutory scheme and `create
distinctions where none were intended.'"  Consumer Party v.
Davis, 778 F.2d 140, 146-47 (3d Cir. 1985) (quoting American
Tobacco Co. v. Patterson, 456 U.S. 63, 71 n.6 (1982)).[27] 
Moreover, such a judicial rewrite would not solve the
constitutional problem.  What the Government calls non-obscene
"pornography" is just as constitutionally protected as other
forms of speech.  Congress's effective ban of a broad and vaguely
defined category of protected speech from most of the Internet
cannot suddenly be made constitutional by narrowing its impact to
a smaller category of equally protected speech.  
     C.   The CDA's Restrictions On "Patently Offensive"
          Expression Fail The Strict Scrutiny Test.

          The Government does not dispute that the CDA's
prohibition of "patently offensive" expression is a content-based
restriction on speech.  It therefore triggers strict scrutiny. 
The Government must demonstrate that the CDA "directly and
materially" serves a compelling governmental interest in the
"least restrictive" way.  Sable Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 492
U.S. 115, 126 (1989); Fabulous Assocs. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util.
Comm'n, 896 F.2d 780, 784-85 (3d Cir. 1990); see Turner
Broadcasting System v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2470 (1994); ALA
P.I. Mem. at 34-35.  The Government cannot meet that standard. 
          1.   The Government has failed to prove that the CDA
               directly and materially advances a compelling
               interest in protecting minors.

          In the abstract, the Government has a compelling
interest in shielding some minors from at least some forms of
"patently offensive" speech.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 126.  But the
CDA's effective ban of such speech from most of the Internet, far
from advancing that interest "in a direct and material way,"
Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2470, "provides only the most limited
incremental support for the interest asserted."  Bolger v. Youngs
Drug Prods. Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 73 (1983).[28]
          It is critical to focus on exactly what is at stake
here:  expression that falls within the statutory definition of
subsection (d) but is not obscene or otherwise unprotected for
adults.  All obscene expression and all child pornography is
properly banned under existing law because it lacks First
Amendment protection even for adults.  To justify the restriction
on "patently offensive" expression at issue here, therefore, the
Government must prove that extending the statutory prohibition to
constitutionally protected, non-obscene expression advances its
interests in a direct and material way.[29]
          Moreover, the Government cannot ignore the facts about
existing protections for minors that have been developed as a
result of market forces without governmental coercion.  As
plaintiffs have demonstrated, there is a rapidly growing market
for user-based technologies that already provide a great deal of
protection.  For over a year, readily available software, such as
Cyber Patrol, SurfWatch, CYBERsitter, and Net Nanny, has enabled
parents and other adults to limit the access of children to
material on the Internet.[30]  Stip.  54; Pl. Pro. Find. Part
III.F.3.
          These products place "responsibility for making such
choices . . . where our society has traditionally placed it -- on
the shoulders of the parent."  Fabulous Assocs., 896 F.2d at 788. 
They are easy to install and use,[31] and have a variety of
features.  And, if parents so choose, they can use the software
to block access to all parts of the Internet that might
potentially be deemed inappropriate for children.
          Cyber Patrol, for example, is designed to enable
parents to block access to online material in any or all of 12
CyberNOT categories (including sexual content) with one simple
step.  Stip.  57.  In addition, parents can use Cyber Patrol to
prevent access to particular sites they deem inappropriate for
their children.  Burrington Test. Decl.  26.  See Pl. Pro. Find.
 806.
          SurfWatch blocks access to more than 5,000 Internet
sites that are known or appear likely to contain text or graphics
of a sexual nature -- at any given time, 90 to 95 percent of all
Internet sites that contain sexual material that might be
inappropriate for children.  Duvall Test. Decl.  23; Duvall
Test., Tr. Vol. I, at 154:12-19.[32]  It also prevents children
from using popular Web search engines to search for common words
that would likely lead to listings of sexually explicit sites. 
Duvall Test. Decl.  19; Schmidt Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 86:16 to
87:2.  SurfWatch, like Cyber Patrol, is routinely updated.  Stip.
 58; Duvall Test. Decl.  11.  And a new feature of SurfWatch,
available soon, will allow adults to block access to all Internet
sites except those they affirmatively pre-select.  Duvall Test.
Decl.  26; Duvall Test., Tr. Vol. I, at 131:11-18, 147:24-148:3.
          The major commercial online services also offer
parental control options free of charge to their members.  Stip.
 69.  These controls permit parents to block their children's
access to elements of the companies' proprietary services, such
as chat rooms and newsgroups, that contain material parents might
consider inappropriate for their children.  Burrington Test.
Decl.  17, 18, 25; Burrington Test., Tr. Vol. III at 43:15.  In
addition, parents using America Online ("AOL") can block all
binary downloads (pictures) from the Internet, Burrington Test.,
Tr. Vol. III, at 43:8-14, while CompuServe and Prodigy give their
subscribers the option of blocking all access to the Internet,
Burrington Test. Decl.  25.  The parental control options
available to online service subscribers are steadily increasing
in number and sophistication.  See generally Burrington Test.
Decl.  13, 29;  see Pl. Pro. Find. Part III.F.2.
          The question, therefore, is whether the CDA's
imposition of speaker-focused controls will add significantly
greater protection.  It clearly will not.  First, even assuming
(as we have argued) that the Act operates to ban "patently
offensive" expression, it will have an impact only on domestic
speakers.  It will have little or no impact on the very
significant percentage of sexually explicit material available
over the Internet that is posted abroad.  See Hoffman Test., Tr.
Vol. II, at 68:1 to 69:14; Duvall Test. Decl.  41; Duvall Test.,
Tr. Vol. I, at 161:17 to 162:18.  See also Schmidt Test., Tr.
Vol. IV, at 68:1-4 (agreeing that a number of sites he accessed
originated abroad).  That is because foreign content providers --
certainly as a practical matter and possibly as a legal matter --
are beyond the reach of United States prosecutors.[33]
          For that reason, even the complete elimination of all
domestically posted sexually explicit material would make no
difference in the ability of a minor -- using a computer without
functioning parental control software -- to gain access to
potentially inappropriate material.  A simple computer search for
sexually explicit material will list both domestic and foreign
sites.  Schmidt Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 124:21-25.  Even if the
total number of sites were reduced by 60-70 percent (the
approximate percentage of sexually explicit sites currently
posted in this country), there would still be ample "patently
offensive" expression available for any minor who is looking for
it.[34]  Pl. Pro. Find.  1166-67.  This undisputed fact
undercuts any effort to protect minors through controlling
speakers on the Internet.
           The Government, as we have noted, disavows any
intention to ban patently offensive speech, and does not agree
that the CDA will, in the long run, operate as a ban on such
speech.  But if that is true, the argument that the statute
advances a legitimate governmental interest unravels entirely. 
The Government's expert acknowledged that protecting minors from
indecent or patently offensive speech, while continuing to make
that speech available to adults, can be accomplished only through
the cooperation of entities other than the speaker, and those
entities will have to utilize screening software.  Olsen Test.,
Tr. Vol. V, at 42:10-14.  Olsen acknowledged that tagging by
speakers is just a method to facilitate screening by the end-
user.  Accordingly, tagging will not protect minors unless
parents or guardians exercise responsibility by using software
that responds to tags.
          Yet with the advent of PICS technology, the Government
has made no showing that there is any advantage to requiring
speakers to tag their own speech -- as opposed to relying on
third parties to provide this service to parents.[35]  And PICS
would be more effective at dealing with the problem of foreign
speakers, because the software could screen out all speech that
has not been affirmatively identified as appropriate for
children.[36]  Thus, under any reading of the CDA, the statute is
a remarkably ineffective means of advancing the Government's
asserted interest in  protecting minors from "patently offensive"
speech, in a direct and material way.
          2.   The CDA is not the least restrictive means of
               advancing the Government's interests.

          The evidentiary record also confirms plaintiffs'
argument that the CDA is not the least restrictive means of
advancing the Government's asserted interest.  See ALA P.I. Mem.
at 34-42; Pltfs Joint BOP Mem. at 6-11.[37] 
          As just noted, for example, the private market has
already developed methods -- such as user blocking software and
PICS -- that are far more effective than the CDA at restricting
minors' access to potentially inappropriate material.  Instead of
imposing the CDA's sweeping prohibition on speech, Congress could
simply have allowed these private markets to develop, and
intervened only if (contrary to current indications) these
methods did not work in specific areas.  See Turner, 114 S. Ct.
at 2470-72.  Congress could also have furthered these market-
driven developments by educating parents and school
administrators about the Internet and available screening options
(compare 47 U.S.C.  551(a)(9)), by assisting parents or schools
in acquiring screening technologies and information, or by
supporting additional research and development.  Indeed, had
Congress undertaken any meaningful inquiry into the nature of
communication on the Internet, it might have developed still
other, less restrictive means of protecting minors.   
          The Government's arguments in this case suggest other
less drastic alternatives Congress could have considered.  If, as
the Government contends, the CDA was principally aimed at
"commercial providers of on-line pornography" (see US ALA Resp.
at 3, 11, 17), Congress could have passed a statute aimed
specifically at that activity.  Cf. Zauderer v. Office of
Disciplinary Counsel, 471 U.S. 626, 645-46 (1985) (government may
not enact a broad prophylactic rule "simply to spare itself the
trouble" of distinguishing speech that is the subject of
legitimate regulatory concern from speech that is not).[38]
          3.   Even if the CDA directly advanced a compelling
               Governmental interest, it would still violate the
               First Amendment.
     
          The Government does not argue that it can
constitutionally ban "patently offensive" expression between
adults in order to prevent minors from gaining access to that
expression, and any such argument would be foreclosed by
governing Supreme Court precedent.  The First Amendment rights of
adults would have to be protected, even if the statute were the
only way to advance the Government's interest in protecting
minors (and it is not).
          The Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that
government may not suppress indecent speech altogether in order
to advance its interest in protecting children.  To the contrary,
"government may not `reduce the adult population . . . to . . .
only what is fit for children.'"[39]  "The level of discourse
reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that which would
be suitable for a sandbox," and this is so "regardless of the
strength of the government's interest" in protecting children. 
Bolger, 463 U.S. at 74-75 (emphasis added).  Government may not
constitutionally "quarantin[e] the general reading public against
books not too rugged for grown men and women in order to shield
juvenile innocence . . . .  Surely this is to burn the house to
roast the pig."  Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383 (1957). 
In Sable, the Court cited Butler to "reiterate" that point, and
stressed that a federal statute is unconstitutional if it has the
"effect of limiting the content of adult [communications] to that
which is suitable for children . . . ."  492 U.S. at 131.[40]
          No court has ever held, in the context of any medium,
that a ban on the transmission of indecent communications to
adults satisfies this exacting standard.  This Court should not
endorse such an unprecedented intrusion on First Amendment
rights.  Instead, it should recognize that the infringement of
First Amendment rights imposed by the Act far outweighs any
incremental advancement of the Government's legitimate interest. 
See Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 363 (1976)("the benefit gained
must outweigh the loss of constitutionally protected rights");
Sable, 492 U.S. at 131; id. at 133 (Scalia, J., concurring);
Fabulous Assocs., 896 F.2d at 787-88.  As in Bolger, "a
restriction of this scope is more extensive than the Constitution
permits."  463 U.S. at 73.
          4.   Strict scrutiny is the appropriate standard of
               review. 

          The Government's prehearing memorandum devotes 25 pages
to strict scrutiny and then appends a half-hearted argument that
an "intermediate scrutiny" standard, drawn from FCC v. Pacifica
Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978), might apply instead. 
Ultimately, however, the Government does not appear to be asking
the Court to apply any standard other than strict scrutiny at
this stage of the case.  See U.S. ALA Br. at 25-26.
          If the Court nevertheless considers this issue, it
should reject defendants' Pacifica argument.  See ALA P.I. Mem.
at 51-57.  The intermediate standard of review in broadcasting
cases originated in Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S.
367 (1969).  Its primary rationale is spectrum scarcity.  Because
"there are more would-be broadcasters than frequencies
available," the Supreme Court has allowed the Government "to
place limited content restraints, and impose certain affirmative
obligations, on broadcast licensees."  Turner, 114 S. Ct. at
2456-57.  It was this unique treatment of broadcasters that
formed the basis of the Court's ruling in Pacifica.  438 U.S. at
748.
          The Court has since refused to extend the intermediate-
scrutiny standard beyond broadcasting to cable television,
Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2457, or to dial-a-porn services, Sable,
492 U.S. at 127-28.  There is no reason to believe it would
arrive at a different conclusion with respect to the Internet,
where there are no limitations on the number of speakers. 
Indeed, the Internet's characteristics are the antithesis of the
"scarcity" that underlies the Red Lion standard.  See Pl. Pro.
Find. Part III.A.9.c.
          Defendants contend that in Pacifica, the Court focused
not so much on scarcity as on broadcasting's "pervasiveness" and
unique accessibility to children.  438 U.S. at 748-49.  They
suggest that these characteristics are shared by the Internet. 
But Pacifica did not hold that the First Amendment can be
relaxed, in any medium, whenever those two characteristics are
present.  To the contrary, before mentioning those
characteristics, the Court made specific reference to Red Lion,
with its scarcity rationale, as the leading case establishing a
uniquely lower First Amendment standard for broadcasting.
          In any event, the Internet is not at all like
broadcasting, and is neither pervasive nor uniquely available to
children.  The Court's central concern in Pacifica was the fact
that broadcasts of "indecent" programming are likely to be turned
on accidentally, by unwilling adults and children alike.  See id.
By contrast, as the evidence here showed, users seeking sexually
explicit material over the Internet must affirmatively seek it
out.  See Schmidt Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 103:7-12 ("odds are
slim" that an online user would "come across a sexually explicit
site by accident").  See Pl. Pro. Find. Part III.E.2.d.  Before
children will confront such materials on the Internet, they must
be able to perform tasks far more complex than turning on a
television or radio.[41]  
          Thus, strict scrutiny applies here.

II.  THE CDA IS UNCONSTITUTIONALLY VAGUE.
          The Act also is unconstitutionally vague, in violation
of the First and Fifth Amendments.  See ALA P.I. Mem. at 62-78. 
The evidence at the hearing powerfully confirmed this
conclusion.[42]
          The Act does not begin to supply the "definiteness,"
Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983), the Constitution
requires of criminal laws that regulate expression. See generally
Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566 (1974); Bouie v. City of Columbia,
378 U.S. 347 (1964).  It is exceptionally indefinite in two
fundamental respects.  First, the key statutory terms "indecent"
and "patently offensive," nowhere defined in the Act, are
hopelessly amorphous, and nothing in the text of the Act
clarifies their meaning.  To the contrary, the fact that the two
operative paragraphs of the Act use different terms would
naturally lead speakers to believe they have different meanings,
and thus to wonder what those different meanings might be.[43] 
The ambiguity of these key operative terms is compounded by the
Act's use of the entirely subjective concepts of "context" and
"community standards."  ALA P.I. Mem. at 64-75.  Second, the
statutory defenses -- defenses the Government has effectively
conceded must be truly practicable if the Act is to survive
constitutional scrutiny -- are themselves extraordinarily vague. 
For non-commercial speakers, subsection (e)(5)(A) provides the
only possible defense, but those speakers are given no meaningful
guidance whatsoever -- either by the text of that subsection or
by the Government's statements in this litigation -- regarding
concrete steps they can take to assure they qualify for the
defense.  See ALA P.I. Mem. at 75-78.   
          Although the Government has been unwilling to specify
the CDA's exact scope, what little the Government has said
underscores the Act's vagueness.  It has suggested, for example,
that the Act's principal (though not exclusive) target is
"pornographic materials."  US ALA Resp. at 11.  This term is
itself fatally indefinite, drawn as it is from colloquial usage
rather than any recognized legal source.  Moreover, even if
"pornography" were further defined as images of sexually explicit
conduct, the Government's suggestion is contradicted by the Act's
unquestioned applicability to textual as well as graphic
communications, by Congress's specific rejection of a "harmful to
minors" standard and its "prurient interest" element, and by the
Government's own position that the "patent offensiveness"
language is based on the FCC standard applied in Pacifica, a case
that did not involve "pornography."  See Point I.B. supra.  And
even if the Government were correct that Congress's principal
target was "pornography," that would not remedy the Act's failure
to make clear what other speech is covered by the more
encompassing statutory language Congress actually used.
          The Government has placed great weight on the statutory
term "context" as a way to limit the scope of subsection (d) and
to exempt from its prohibitions speech that has serious value. 
See US ALA Resp. at 10; US ACLU Resp. at 46-49.  In a civil
enforcement regime administered by an administrative agency with
expertise regulating a particular medium, see, e.g., Pacifica,
regulations or rulings regarding "context" could conceivably,
over time, develop some guidelines.[44]  But as a standard for
criminal liability to be applied by hundreds of prosecutors and
judged by diverse communities across the country, "context" is an
open invitation to arbitrary enforcement.  Because speech on the
Internet is communicated throughout the nation (and the world),
speakers will have to decide whether to speak based on how the
most aggressive prosecutor in the most censorious community may
view the "context" of their speech.[45]  The Act thus embodies the
worst evil of vague criminal prohibitions on speech: individuals
will "steer far wider of the unlawful zone," Speiser v. Randall,
357 U.S. 513, 526 (1958), than if the boundaries were "clearly
marked," Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 372 (1964).
          The Government has pointedly declined to explain what
it understands "context" to mean.[46]  Moreover, when questioned
by the Court, the Government's own witness (an expert on computer
crime) demonstrated in the most compelling terms the total
indeterminacy of "context" as a limiting principle.  Howard
Schmidt explained that in his opinion depictions of Indian
sculptures of couples engaged in explicit sexual conduct would
not be proscribed because such communications would have an
"educational" or "cultural" context, whereas a far less explicit
nude photograph on the cover of Vanity Fair magazine would be
proscribed because its context indicated it was "for fun more
than anything else."[47]  If, as the Government contends,
particularized inquiry into a communication's "context" is
necessary to determine what is lawful and what is not, then the
CDA starkly epitomizes the very perils of discriminatory,
capricious, unpredictable enforcement the void-for-vagueness
doctrine is designed to avoid.[48]
          The evidence at the hearing also made clear that the
Act's defenses are unconstitutionally vague.  The Government has
effectively conceded that most speakers (including all
noncommercial speakers) are unable to communicate "patently
offensive" material lawfully on the Internet unless they can
qualify for the subsection (e)(5)(A) defense ("good faith,
reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions").  Thus, it is
just as critical for speakers to know whether they qualify for
the (e)(5)(A) defense as it is for them to know whether their
speech is covered by the Act at all.   
          But the Government has done nothing to cure the
statute's utter failure to specify what speakers such as the
plaintiffs here can do to qualify for this defense.  As noted,
the Government has devoted considerable effort to show that
"tagging" is technically feasible in some circumstances, but it
does not suggest tagging could be a defense under (e)(5)(A) until
compatible end-user software is in widespread use, and it refuses
to take a position on whether tagging would be a defense even if
every end-user had compatible software in place today.  If the
Act is not a complete ban of "patently offensive" speech from
most of the Internet, it can only be because there are, today,
"reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions" speakers can
take to restrict access by minors while allowing access by
adults.  But the Government does not even hypothesize what those
actions would be.  It is a violation of due process to compel
speakers to risk their liberty in order to test what those
actions might be.  See Hynes, 425 U.S. at 620; Dombrowski v.
Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 491 (1965).[49]
          In the end, the Government's only response regarding
the vagueness of the "indecent" and "patently offensive"
standards, and of the scope of the safe harbor and access
provider defenses, is that prosecutors, judges and jurors can be
trusted to construe these provisions reasonably.  But the void-
for-vagueness doctrine specifically rules out that argument.  See
Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 599 (1967)("It is no
answer" for government to defend a vague law by "say[ing] that
[it] would not be applied in such a case."); Baggett v. Bullitt,
377 U.S. at 373 ("[w]ell-intentioned prosecutors and judicial
safeguards do not neutralize the vice of a vague law").  Citizens
are entitled to fair and reasonably specific warning of what a
criminal law means before they are forced to risk prosecution,
and they cannot be relegated simply to "trusting" the government
to exercise lenity toward speech, particularly speech that may
well be unpopular, caustic, or intensely critical of the
governors themselves.  
          The CDA is therefore unconstitutionally vague. 

III. THE CHALLENGED PROVISIONS OF THE CDA ARE INVALID ON THEIR
     FACE AND AS APPLIED.  

          Because of the force of plaintiffs' constitutional
challenge in this case, the Government's primary goal seems to be
to avoid at all costs having to defend the actual, present impact
of the CDA on protected speech.  To avoid review, the Government
(1) argues that facial review of the Act is inappropriate and
then (2) assumes, without explanation, that the Court should not
review the provisions as applied to plaintiffs.  However,
established First Amendment doctrines strongly support facial
review in this case.  In any event, at a minimum, the Court
should invalidate the statute as applied to the current array of
plaintiffs.
     A.   The Challenged Provisions Are Facially Invalid In All
          Their Applications.

          Although it is defending a law that, on its face,
imposes content-based restrictions on fully protected speech, the
Government argues that the law cannot be facially challenged
because it contains a defense that renders its application
constitutional as to a narrow subset of speakers, i.e. "those
commercial vendors of online pornography who use credit card
authorization or similar means . . . to restrict access to their
material" and thus are able to use the subsection (e)(5)(B)
defense.  US ALA Resp. at 17.  See also id. at 19; Defendants'
Response to the Court's Inquiry Concerning Burden of Proof
Issues, at 3-4.
          This argument is utterly meritless.  As we show in the
next section, a facial challenge to the CDA's restrictions on
"patently offensive" communications is entirely appropriate
because that restriction violates the First Amendment in the
overwhelming majority of its applications.
          In any event, defendants' "commercial vendors" argument
ignores the fact that plaintiffs have mounted a facial challenge
to subsection (d) on vagueness grounds.  As the "void-for-
vagueness" doctrine's name signals, courts have not hesitated to
strike down on their face laws that fail to "define the criminal
offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can
understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does
not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement." 
Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. at 357.  See id. at 360-61; Smith v.
Goguen, 415 U.S. at 582; Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451,
458 (1939).  See also Kreimer v. Bureau of Police, 958 F.2d 1242,
1266 (3d Cir. 1992) ("[A] meritorious First Amendment vagueness
challenge will annul an unclear law that 'chills' protected First
Amendment activities.")  The subsection (e)(5)(B) defense does
nothing to cure this vagueness problem.[50]  
          Furthermore, defendants also ignore the fact that
Congress authorized a facial challenge precisely because it did
not want to wait for years of as-applied challenges to be
resolved before it would know whether it had enacted a statute
that could be applied in more than a handful of cases.[51]  A
holding that the CDA is not subject to facial review because it
can constitutionally be applied to a small segment of speakers
would produce precisely the result Congress wanted to avoid: 
years of as-applied challenges before the constitutional scope of
the CDA would be known.[52]
     B.   The Challenged Provisions Are Facially Invalid Because
          They Are Overbroad.

          Even if the Court were to agree with defendants that
the Act is not invalid in all applications, it would still be
required to hold the Act facially invalid because it remains
invalid in the overwhelming majority of applications.  The
Government certainly has not carried its burden of showing that
non-commercial speakers or speakers utilizing newsgroups, mail
exploders or IRC chat will be able to use the safe-harbor
defenses.  Thus, in all of its applications to such speakers, the
Act imposes an effective ban on "patently offensive" expression
and is, as a result, much broader than the First Amendment
permits.  This means the Act should be struck down on its face on
overbreadth grounds.[53]
          Although in most other areas of constitutional law a
litigant challenging a law "on its face" must show that the law
is invalid in every application, see United States v. Salerno,
481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987), in First Amendment cases the law is
"nearly the opposite:  a statute is invalid in all its
applications if it is invalid in any of them, or at least enough
to make it 'substantially' overbroad."[54]  This rule is "based on
an appreciation that the very existence of some broadly written
laws has the potential to chill the expression of [persons] not
before the court."  Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 112
S. Ct. 2395, 2401 (1992).  See also Secretary of State of
Maryland v. J.H. Munson Co., 467 U.S. 947, 958 (1984); Broadrick
v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612 (1973).  Where, as here, a statute
chills a substantial amount of protected speech, the overbreadth
doctrine ensures that affected speakers and listeners will not
have to self-censor their speech until each possible application
of the statute is litigated on a case-by-case basis.
          The Government has offered two responses to this
overbreadth argument, neither of which is persuasive.  First, the
Government has mischaracterized the argument -- claiming that
plaintiffs argue that the statute is "overbroad" only because it
extends beyond pornography to cover speech on "education,
scientific and/or literary issues."  US ALA Resp at 14.  Based on
this mischaracterization, the Government argues that the solution
is to construe the statute narrowly to exclude coverage of such
"serious value" speech.  Id. at 15.  But see supra, I.B.
(pointing out that this construction is not supported by the
statute's text or history).
          This argument entirely misses plaintiffs' two basic
points.  First, plaintiffs challenge the CDA as it applies to the
entire spectrum of non-obscene communication, no part of which
may be banned for adults.  The Act's suppression of material with
serious value compounds, but does not exhaust, the Act's
unconstitutional effect.  The Act is no less unconstitutional for
material the Government would characterize as "pornography" than
it is for material with "serious value."  See Sable, 492 U.S. at
128-31 (striking down a "dial-a-porn" statute limited to
commercial sexually explicit telephone communications, without
any suggestion that the speech at issue had "serious value"). 
Second, the overbreadth of the Act arises most palpably from its
application to noncommercial speakers and all speakers utilizing
newsgroups, mail exploders or IRC chat, who, regardless of the
content or "value" of their protected expression, cannot
prescreen their potential audience.  That overbreadth problem
would not be eliminated through a narrowing construction of the
statute to exempt "serious value" speech (even if such a
construction were possible). 
          The Government's second response to the facial
overbreadth argument is its suggestion that plaintiffs lack
standing to maintain an overbreadth challenge because they allege
that their own speech is constitutionally protected.  US ALA Resp
at 14.  The Supreme Court's most recent ruling on this issue,
however, flatly rejects the argument that overbreadth claims can
be brought only by parties to whom the statute may
constitutionally be applied.  In Board of Trustees v. Fox, 492
U.S. 469, 484 (1989), the Court stated that "while the
overbreadth doctrine was born as an expansion of the law of
standing, it would produce absurd results to limit its
application strictly to that context."  The Court reasoned that
it would make no sense to grant the right to mount a facial
challenge to parties whose speech has validly been regulated and
who are personally unaffected by the statute's overbreadth, while
denying that right to parties who claim to have been directly
affected by the statute's overbreadth themselves.  Id.[55]
          Thus, it is clear that plaintiffs may challenge the CDA
as facially overbroad, even though plaintiffs also claim that the
challenged provisions infringe their own First Amendment rights. 
Plaintiffs' claims obviously implicate the core concern of the
overbreadth doctrine -- the danger "that the statute's very
existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from
constitutionally protected speech or expression."  Broadrick, 413
U.S. at 612.  
          Accordingly, even if the Act does not unduly restrict
speech by a small class of commercial content providers who can
prescreen, it does effectively ban a great deal of protected
speech by everyone else.  Therefore, it is beyond reasonable
dispute that the CDA operates unconstitutionally for "a
substantial category" of the speakers it covers, Village of
Schaumberg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U.S. 620,
634 (1980), and that it "criminalizes a substantial amount of
constitutionally protected speech," City of Houston v. Hill, 482
U.S. 451, 466 (1987).
          This substantial overbreadth requires invalidation of
Section (d) on its face.  The provision cannot be saved by a
narrowing construction because it is not "easily susceptible" to
such a construction.  Erznoznik, 422 U.S. at 216 n.15.  This
Court would have to limit the Act's application to "pornography,"
despite Congress' clear intention that it apply far more broadly,
and to commercial speakers who, as a practical matter, can avail
themselves of credit card or adult access screening, despite
Congress' clear intention that the Act should govern all Internet
users.  This Court should not rewrite the Act in the face of such
clear indicia of contrary Congressional intent.  And without such
a rewrite, the Act will continue to suppress and deter vast
amounts of protected expression.  Thus, this Court must
invalidate Section (d) in toto.[56]

     C.   The Challenged Provisions Are Unconstitutional As
          Applied To Plaintiffs.

          The Government (for understandable reasons) never
attempts to defend the constitutionality of the CDA as applied to
plaintiffs.  However, even if the Government were correct that
the CDA should not be invalidated "facially" (i.e., in all
applications), plaintiffs would nonetheless be entitled to relief
because the challenged provisions are unconstitutional as applied
to them.  See NTEU, 115 S. Ct. at 1018-19.
          Plaintiffs have not limited their claims to "facial"
claims, and they are not required to choose between a facial
challenge and an as-applied challenge.  Indeed, First Amendment
plaintiffs commonly combine the two.  E.g., Fox, 492 U.S. at 484;
Board of Airport Comm'rs v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U.S. 569
(1987); Lind v. Grimmer, 30 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir. 1994), cert.
denied, 115 S. Ct. 902 (1995).  And Congress specifically
contemplated that plaintiffs bringing a facial challenge to the
CDA could also bring an as-applied challenge.  See Conf. Rep. at
197 ("[T]he three-judge district court could hear both a facial
challenge and an 'as-applied' challenge if they were combined in
the same action and facial validity had not yet been
determined.")
          Thus, if the Court were to conclude that the CDA should
not be invalidated in all its applications, plaintiffs' as-
applied challenge would have to be addressed.  Plaintiffs have
made a comprehensive (and largely unrebutted) showing that the
Act directly infringes their own First Amendment rights.[57]  No
plaintiff falls within the small category of content providers
the Government contends can feasibly comply with the Act by means
short of self-censorship -- "those commercial vendors of online
pornography who use credit card authorization or similar means .
. . to restrict access to their material."  US ALA Resp. at 17.
          Moreover, plaintiffs' as-applied challenge is fully
ripe even though no plaintiff has yet been prosecuted.  See,
e.g., NTEU, 115 S. Ct. at 1011; American Library Ass'n v. Reno,
33 F.3d 78, 83-84 (D.C. Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 2610
(1995).  The CDA imposes direct compliance burdens on all of the
plaintiffs, and is suppressing their speech right now.  The
Government has given no assurance that it will not prosecute in
the future for current speech, and plaintiffs have "an actual and
well-founded fear that the law will be enforced against them." 
Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 484 U.S. 383, 393 (1988). 
That continuing threat of criminal liability is pressuring each
of them to engage in "self-censorship; a harm that can be
realized even without an actual prosecution."  Id.  A preliminary
injunction would prevent that harm.  At a minimum, therefore,
plaintiffs are entitled to a remedy sufficient to preclude
enforcement of the challenged provisions against them.
          If the Court concludes (as it should) that plaintiffs'
facial and as-applied challenges are both valid, it will have
discretion whether to grant "facial" relief or instead limit its
injunction to the CDA's application to the plaintiffs.[58]  Here,
for strong reasons of practicality and substantive First
Amendment policy, the Court should declare the challenged
provisions facially invalid.
          First, because plaintiffs represent a vast array of
speakers and listeners using all the modes of speech that exist
in cyberspace, the very judicial economy concerns that
"ordinarily" favor deciding an as-applied challenge before a
facial one, see Fox, 492 U.S. at 485, compel the opposite
conclusion here.  Second, Congress itself evinced a desire to
have the CDA's validity dispositively determined in an expedited
preenforcement proceeding.  See Point III.A. supra.  An "as-
applied" ruling, finding the CDA unconstitutional as applied to
plaintiffs but leaving its provisions nominally in force as to
non-parties, would be inconsistent with that desire.  Third, and
most important, an "as-applied" remedy would not eliminate the
chilling effect of the CDA's grossly overbroad and vague
provisions.[59]  Although the Government might not prosecute
individuals or entities whose situation is precisely the same as
one or more of the plaintiffs sheltered by such an injunction, a
remedy limited to the plaintiffs would inevitably leave many non-
parties in a state of perilous uncertainty about the CDA's
applicability to them.  Facial invalidation is appropriate where,
as here, the speech rights of non-parties would otherwise hinge
on the results of "a series of adjudications."  Jews for Jesus,
482 U.S. at 576.  "[T]he chilling effect of the [statute] on
protected speech in the meantime would make such a case-by-case
adjudication intolerable."  Id. at 575-76.

IV.  THE IRREPARABLE HARM TO PLAINTIFFS, THEIR MEMBERS, AND THEIR
     SUBSCRIBERS, PATRONS, AND CUSTOMERS FAR OUTWEIGHS ANY HARM
     TO THE GOVERNMENT IF AN INJUNCTION ISSUES, AND THE PUBLIC
     INTEREST FAVORS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.  

          It is a bedrock legal principle that any deprivation of
First Amendment rights constitutes irreparable injury.  See ALA
P.I. Mem. at 78-80.  Plaintiffs reasonably fear prosecution under
the Act, and their only alternative to prosecution is self-
censorship.[60]
          The public also has a substantial, constitutionally
protected interest in having access to a robust, uninhibited flow
of constitutionally protected speech.  See Turner, 114 S. Ct. at
2458 ("At the heart of the First Amendment lies the principle
that each person should decide for him or herself the ideas and
beliefs deserving of expression, consideration and adherence
. . . .  Government action that stifles speech . . . ,
contravenes this essential right."); Virginia State Bd. of
Pharmacy v. Virginia Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748 (1976).  This
interest is severely damaged by the Act.  Indeed, as shown above,
in addition to its suppressive effect on plaintiffs' speech, the
Act is currently having a widespread chilling effect on thousands
of speakers and listeners who are not before the Court.  Although
the public's interest in protecting minors from communications
that might be inappropriate for them is also substantial, that
interest is -- at best -- only marginally advanced by the
provisions plaintiffs ask this Court to enjoin.  Moreover, user
software will continue to block communications parents deem
inappropriate for their children, even if the challenged
provisions of the Act are enjoined.
          The damage to constitutionally protected expression
that has already occurred, and the further damage that will occur
if defendants are not enjoined, is incalculable.  Substantial
quantities of constitutionally protected speech are being and
will continue to be suppressed across the Nation.  The
concomitant negative impact on the burgeoning medium for
interactive computer services will be substantial.  Entry of the
relief requested, pending final resolution of the merits, will
cause defendants no significant harm, especially because there
are other criminal statutes (including this Act's application to
"obscene" communications) that prohibit the communications they
claim are the principal focus of the Act.  Any delay in entry of
relief, however, perpetuates and compounds the damage to
plaintiffs' First Amendment rights and the First Amendment rights
of millions of adults to send and receive communications that are
indisputably constitutionally protected for them.

                            CONCLUSION
          Plaintiffs have shown they are likely to prevail on the
merits of their constitutional challenge, and that they are
suffering irreparable injury.  Accordingly, preliminary
injunctive relief against enforcement of the challenged
provisions of 47 U.S.C.  223(a)(1)(B)(ii), 223(a)(2) and 223(d)
is essential and amply justified.

1. Section 502 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L.
No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56, 133 (1996) (to be codified at 47
U.S.C.  223(a)(1)(B), (a)(2) and (d)).
2. ALA Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law in Support of Their Motion
for a Preliminary Injunction (March 1, 1996) ("ALA P.I. Mem."),
at 16-21, and 25-42.  Plaintiffs respectfully refer the Court to
that Memorandum for a more comprehensive discussion of our First
and Fifth Amendment arguments and other legal points.
3. See ALA P.I. Mem. at 27-30, and Point I.C.3., infra.
4. Section 223(a)(1)(B) bans use of a "telecommunications
device" for any "obscene or indecent" communication with a person
known to be under age 18, and Section 223(a)(2) imposes liability
on a person who "knowingly permits any telecommunications
facility under his control to be used for any activity prohibited
by [Section 223(a)(1)]."  47 U.S.C.  223(a)(1)(B)(ii), (a)(2). 
The primary problem with these provisions is their overbreadth: 
for example, they would punish a university professor for
transmitting to 17-year-old freshmen sexually explicit course
materials.  See ALA P.I. Mem. at 45-48; Boiss Supp. Decl.  3-
4, 6. 
5. See Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiff American Library
Association, et al.'s Motion for a Preliminary Injunction ("US
ALA Resp.") at 16-17 ("[S]ection 223(d) . . . by no means is a
'ban' on adult expression.  Rather, it is a command to
information content providers on the Internet to undertake
reasonable measures to direct their communications to other
adults, rather than to minors.").
6. It is undisputed that the burden of demonstrating that the
Act is narrowly tailored rests squarely on the Government.  See
ACLU and ALA Plaintiffs' Joint Response to the Court's Questions
Regarding the Burden of Proof ("Pltfs Joint BOP Mem."), at 6-11;
Defendants' Response to the Court's Inquiry Concerning Burden of
Proof Issues, at 5.
7. Bradner Test. Decl.  46-49 (newsgroup); 39-41 (mail
exploder); 56-59 (IRC chat).
8. Bradner Test. Decl.  41, 42, 49-50, 59; see also Schmidt
Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 73:15 to 74:2; cf. Bradner Test. Decl.
 22-33 (same technological infeasibility applies to one-to-one
e-mail).
9. Olsen Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 219:23 to 220:8; Olsen Test.
Decl.  19.
10. The Government's expert witness testified that even a one-
minute delay in Internet access would be intolerable for the
average user.  See Olsen Test., Tr. Vol. V, at 73:3-9.
11. Imposing this task on content providers is constitutionally
suspect.  See Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, 152-55 (1959).
12. The defenses in section 223(e)(1)-(4) are irrelevant.  
13. Plaintiffs specifically asked the Government whether a
speaker rating or labeling system would constitute a defense. 
ALA Plaintiffs' First Set of Interrogatories to Defendants,
Interrogatory 1 (March 18, 1996).  The Government objected to
that interrogatory and refused to provide a specific response. 
Defendants' Responses to ALA Plaintiffs' First Set of
Interrogatories (March 20, 1996).

     The Government's ambiguous posture mirrors language in the
Conference Report, which acknowledges that "content selection
standards" and "other technologies" that are "currently under
development, might qualify" as defenses, but makes clear they
would qualify only "if they are effective at protecting minors
from exposure to indecent material via the Internet."  H.R. Conf.
Rep. No. 458, 104th Cong., 2d Sess., at 190 (1996)(emphasis
added)("Conf. Rep.").
14. He confirmed, for example, that there is currently no way to
post an "indecent" message in a newsgroup and avoid the risk of
prosecution under the Act, because, even if the message is
tagged, there is no way of insuring that the message will not be
"available" to persons under 18.  Id. at 234:19-25.

     Olsen acknowledged that the tag "-L18" is technologically
and functionally identical to the tag "xxx."  Olsen Test., Tr.
Vol. IV, at 208:19-209:3.  Of course, some speakers already tag
their speech "xxx," or in other ways that indicate its sexually
oriented content (such as "alt.sex.erotica"), and Senator Exon,
the sponsor of the CDA, certainly did not consider those tags to
be a defense; to the contrary, he considered them to be a
problem, because minors can use those tags to find inappropriate
speech.  See 141 Cong. Rec. S8089 (daily ed. June 9,
1995)(statement of Sen. Exon).
15. The CDA specifies that measures taken under subsection (e)
to restrict or prevent access by minors must be "effective" and
"feasible under available technology."  47 U.S.C.  223(e)(5)(A).
16. See Pl. Pro. Find. Part III.F.4; Olsen Test., Tr. Vol. IV,
at 222:10 to 224:11; id., Tr. Vol. V, at 89:5-8 (acknowledging
that PICS works in this manner and will be available in 2-3
months).
17. There is no evidence in this record on that point.  See
Sable Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 129-30 (1989).
18. See 47 U.S.C.  223(b)(2)(A) (criminalizing making any
indecent telephone communication "for commercial purposes"
(emphasis added).
19. Conf. Rep. at 191.  Indeed, the Government's hearing
evidence included repeated references to newsgroups, even though
newsgroups and newsgroup speakers are not commercial speakers. 
Senator Exon also referred to newsgroups as a principal target of
the legislation.  See 141 Cong. Rec. S8089 (daily ed. June 9,
1995).
20. Congress deliberately rejected the narrower "harmful-to-
minors" standard that originated in Ginsberg v. New York, 390
U.S. 629 (1968).  See Conf. Rep. 189.  Indeed, Congress rejected
an amendment that would have specified that speech could not be
found indecent or patently offensive if it had serious value for
minors.  See ACLU Post-Trial Br., at 9-15 & n. 15.  Thus, the
Government now asks the Court to adopt an interpretation
approximating the very standard Congress rejected.
21. See, e.g., Enforcement of Prohibitions Against Broadcast
Indecency in 18 U.S.C.  1464, 5 FCC Rcd. 5297, 5308-09 (1990). 
See also Gillett Communications of Atlanta v. Becker, 807 F.
Supp. 757 (N.D. Ga. 1992)(holding TV broadcast of videotape
"Abortion in America:  The Real Story," as part of a political
advertisement by a candidate for public office, was indecent),
appeal dismissed, 5 F.3d 1500 ( 11th Cir. 1993).
22. Thus, although the Pacifica Court emphasized that that case
did not involve a criminal sanction, 438 U.S. at 750, the ACLU
now faces potential prosecution for posting the same George
Carlin monologue online.  Stip.  78.  Similarly, it was not a
crime to publish the "Rimm" study in print, but online
publication of that study puts libraries at risk of prosecution
under the Act.  Croneberger Test. Decl.  15, 17.  The
Government has shown no justification for criminalizing speech on
the Internet that would not be criminally sanctioned if it were
broadcast on television or radio, or published in a print medium.
23. See also KLOL(FM), 8 FCC Rcd. 3228 (1993); WVIC-FM, 6 FCC
Rcd. 7484 (1991).  Indeed, in Pacifica, the Supreme Court did not
suggest that George Carlin's satirical monologue lacked serious
value.  See Action For Children's TV v. FCC, 852 F.2d 1332, 1340
n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (concluding monologue "may be an example of
indecent material possessing significant social value").
24. Illinois Citizens Committee for Broadcasting v. FCC, 515
F.2d 397, 406 (D.C. Cir. 1974); Implementation of Section 10 of
the Cable Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, 8 FCC
Rcd. 998, 1004 (1993) ("We do not agree that any determination of
indecency [in the cable medium] is required [to] take into
account the work as a whole."); WIOD, 6 FCC Rcd. 3704, 3705
(1989)(less than 5 percent of a program devoted to sexually-
oriented material supports an indecency finding "[w]hether or not
the context of the entire Neil Rogers Show dwelt on sexual
themes").
25. See Schmidt Test. Decl. Exs. 3, 8, 11, 12, 25, 26, 27, 30,
31, 38, 41, 42, 43, 44, 47, 52.  At least one online image was
virtually identical to, but less explicit than, an image in the
print version of Playboy Magazine.  Compare Def. Exh. 42, at 5
(print version) with Def. Ex. 43, at 3 (online image); see
Schmidt Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 98:13-21; Schmidt Test. Decl.
 46.  Senator Exon confirmed that the prohibition would apply to
an online version of Playboy Magazine.  141 Cong. Rec. S8330
(June 14, 1995) (Sen. Exon).  Thus, publication of the print
version of the image was entirely lawful; publication of the
online version is apparently a felony.
26. See n. 20 supra, and accompanying text.
27. It would not be possible to narrow the scope of the Act by
severing "invalid" language.  This case is thus unlike Brockett
v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491 (1985), where the Court
held that it was permissible to sever one problematic word --
"lust" -- from an otherwise complete and valid law in order to
assure that the law covered only obscenity.  See also Lind v.
Grimmer, 30 F.3d 1115, 1122 (9th Cir. 1994) (discussing
Brockett), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 902 (1995).
28. As explained more fully in our prehearing memorandum (see
ALA P.I. Mem. at 38-42), here, as in Sable, the legislative
record provides no support for the Government on this point.  The
Government's case therefore depends entirely on the factual
record put before this Court.
29. Some of the images referred to by Howard Schmidt involve
depictions of sexually explicit conduct.  See Schmidt Test. Decl.
Exs. 4, 14, 19, 22, 24, 46, 49, 51.  These images meet the
threshold requirement for an obscenity prosecution, and could
therefore be found obscene if a jury determined they meet the
Miller test.  Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973).  The
Government already has ample means to punish such communications
under existing laws banning obscenity and child pornography.  See
ALA P.I. Mem. at 38.  To the extent purveyors of such material
are already willing to violate these other laws, the CDA will not
deter them (although user blocking would prevent their material
from reaching children).  See, e.g., Riley v. National Fed'n of
the Blind, Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 800 (1988) (statute is not
narrowly tailored if "vigorously enforc[ing]" existing laws would
have substantially the same effect).
30. The Government made no attempt to rebut this evidence -- or
even to "test" these control mechanisms.  See Schmidt Test., Tr.
Vol. IV, at 79:4 to 80:1 (tested only SurfWatch); Olsen Test.,
Tr. Vol. IV, at 196:17-21.
31. Duvall Test. Decl.  13; Pl. Pro. Find.  788, 807.
32. SurfWatch blocks all of the sites Senator Exon used to
justify the Act.  141 Cong. Rec. S8089 (daily ed. June 9, 1995). 
For example, it blocks access to all "alt.sex" newsgroups. 
Duvall Test. Decl.  24.  It also blocks all of the sites
submitted by defendants as exhibits in opposition to the ACLU's
TRO motion, including excerpted material such as the "Internet
Yellow Pages."  Id.  25.  See Pl. Pro. Find.  800.
33. It is highly doubtful whether the United States even has the
authority under customary international law to restrict
"indecent" or "patently offensive" speech placed on the Internet
by foreign speakers, especially where the speech was not
specifically directed to the United States.  See 1 Restatement
(3d) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States  403
(limitations on nations' "jurisdiction to prescribe").  It is
unlikely that the United States would wish to -- or even that it
could consistent with the First Amendment -- subscribe to a
principle of reciprocity in international law whereby American
Internet users would be subject to foreign nations' often very
draconian speech restrictions for any Internet speech accessible
in those nations.  Surely the United States would not agree that
a domestic poster of Internet speech critical of China's human
rights record could be prosecuted by that country for violation
of its law prohibiting speech critical of the government.

     Domestic caching of foreign material (to the extent it
occurs) is not a solution to this problem.  The operator of a
cache on the Internet (such as the operator of a transatlantic
cable) could not be treated as a republisher of the overseas
content for the purpose of the CDA.  As defendants' expert
admits, the cache operator does not have any knowledge of the
data that is temporarily cached.  Olsen Test., Tr. Vol. V., at
55:24 to 56:1.  Caching is an automatic process that takes place
without any knowledge on the part of the cache operator of the
content being cached -- the content is simply a "stream of bits." 
Id. at 56:1.  This type of "intermediate storage" is precisely
what is excluded from coverage by the CDA in  223(e)(1).  Olsen
testified that, if a screening requirement were imposed on
cachers, they would simply stop caching.  Olsen Test., Tr. Vol.
V, at 55:19 to 57:6.
34. In fact, to the extent the same or virtually identical
content is available from both domestic and foreign sites, the
Act will not diminish minors' ability to access that content at
all.  Much "pornography" is functionally indistinguishable from
other "pornography."  And as more and more domestic sites move
abroad, or use anonymous foreign re-mailers, the problem of
foreign postings will be compounded.
35. PICS technology enables parents or other adults to select
which Internet material children can access, based on labels that
assign ratings to the content.  Vezza Test. Decl.  5.  PICS will
provide the ability for third parties, as well as individual
content providers, to rate content on the Internet in a variety
of ways.  Stip.  50; Vezza Test. Decl.  5.  For example,
material could be rated as inappropriate for children under 10;
or inappropriate because of violence or sexual content.  This
flexibility enables parents to give older children access to more
material than younger children.  Vezza Test. Decl.  12.  PICS-
compatible Web browsers, Usenet News Group readers, and other
Internet applications, will provide parents the ability to choose
from a variety of rating services, or a combination of services. 
Stip.  50.  See Pl. Pro. Find.  826-28, 837.

          The PICS working group participants include many of the
major online services providers, commercial Internet access
providers, hardware and software companies, major Internet
content providers, and consumer organizations.  Stip.  51, 52. 
Given the powerful market forces driving development of PICS, the
chance that all vendors will adhere to the PICS standard are
"extremely high."  Vezza Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 182:23 to 183:20. 
Indeed, it is anticipated that all of the major online services
and Web browsing software programs will be PICS-compatible by
early summer 1996, and that at least four independent content
ratings will be available (three of them at no cost) by that
time.  Burrington Test. Decl.  29.
36. No system dependent on tagging by speakers of their own
speech is ever going to be fully effective.  For example, Olsen
acknowledged it is unlikely that foreign speakers would tag their
own speech.  Olsen Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 226:4-18.  And Schmidt
agreed that foreign countries where sexual material often
originates have more lenient views about the legality of such
material.  Schmidt Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 131:14-24.
37. Congress enacted the CDA after only cursory examination of
alternative, less restrictive approaches, and without making any
findings concerning the nature of the problem it sought to
address.  See ALA P.I. Mem. at 35-37 & n.72.  Congress's failure
to recognize user blocking as a less restrictive alternative in
the computer context is especially indefensible in light of
Congress's explicit endorsement of user blocking as a "narrowly
tailored" approach to addressing violence and sex on television. 
See Pltfs Joint BOP Mem. at 9-10.
38. The Government has essentially conceded that a great deal of
the expression covered by the CDA is at the outer periphery of
Congress's concern.  It has not seriously contended, for example,
that purely textual "indecency" -- including the satirical use of
profanity at issue in Pacifica -- was viewed by Congress as a
serious concern.  Although eliminating the CDA's application to
textual material would not by itself have resolved the CDA's
constitutional defects, it would have dramatically reduced the
amount of constitutionally protected speech covered by the
statute, without material harm to the Government's asserted
interests.  See ALA P.I. Mem. at 41. 
39. Sable Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. at 128 (quoting from
Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp. 463 U.S. 60, 73 (1983),
which in turn quoted from Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383
(1957)).
40. Thus, this bedrock principle has already been applied in the
context of sale or distribution of immoral books and other
printed materials (Butler), use of the postal service to mail
unsolicited commercial advertisements about contraceptives to
homes (Bolger), and use of the telephone to sell sexually
explicit communications (Sable).
41. Anker Test. Decl.  28; see Duvall Test., Tr. Vol. I, at
107:8 to 132:14 (demonstrating complexity of computer and
Internet tasks).  Moreover, as noted, parents have a range of
software options to limit children's access to the Internet.  See
Point I.C.1. supra.
42. The record contains ample evidence of plaintiffs' inability
to define the scope of the CDA's prohibitions and defenses.  Pl.
Pro. Find. Part IV.D.1.  See also ALA P.I. Mem. at 79-80.
43. Furthermore, the Conference Report (which most speakers will
never see) compounds the confusion by ascribing to the FCC
"indecency" precedents the Act purportedly adopts, a gloss on
those terms that cannot be found in those precedents.  See, e.g.,
Conf. Rep. at 189 (stating that the FCC's "patent offensiveness"
standard requires the "intention to be offensive"). In fact, it
does not.  Moreover, although the Government elsewhere invokes
the Conference Report in an effort to give meaning to the CDA's
terms, e.g., US ALA Resp. at 11 ("the Conference Report ... makes
crystal-clear the statute's intended scope"), it nowhere
contends, notwithstanding the explicit statement in the
Conference Report, that "patent offensiveness" under subsection
(d) requires proof of "intention to offend."  It is
understandable that the Government would choose to ignore this
language from the Conference Report, because an "intent to
offend" requirement would provide a defense even for
"pornographers" if they could show their only intent was to
titillate or to make money by selling their speech to adults.  
44. In fact, however, the FCC has had extreme difficulty
determining the meaning of indecency even in the broadcast
context.  See, e.g., William J. Byrnes, Esq., 63 Rad. Reg. 2d
(P&F) 216 (Mass Media Bureau 1987)(declining to clarify whether
Pacifica radio's broadcast of its annual Bloomsday reading from
James Joyce's Ulysses would be indecent).  See also ACLU Post-
Trial Br. at 9-15.
45. The Government's expert witness acknowledged that community
standards vary throughout the country.  Schmidt Test., Tr. Vol.
IV, at 137-38.
46. It might refer, for example, to the nature of the rest of
the communication of which the potentially "offensive" message is
a part, the time of day it was conveyed, the purpose of the
communication, the intended, probable or actual audience, the
elegance or inelegance of its presentation, the identity of the
speaker, the presence or absence of warnings or other indications
that the communication may not be appropriate for minors, or the
specific mode of communication.  
47. Schmidt Test., Tr. Vol. III at 140-41.  As Schmidt's
testimony suggests, one variant of "context" that some
prosecutors may draw upon to decide whether a communication is
prohibited is whether the communication constitutes "art" and
"entertainment."  That highly subjective decision should not be
left to government officials, whether prosecutors or judges.  Cf.
Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co., 188 U.S. 239, 251
(1903) ("It would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained
only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the
worth of pictorial illustrations, outside of the narrowest and
most obvious limits.").    
48. See Hynes v. Mayor & Council, 425 U.S. 610, 622 (1976);
Community Television of Utah v. Wilkinson, 611 F. Supp. 1099,
1117 (D. Utah 1985), aff'd, 800 F.2d 989 (10th Cir. 1986), aff'd,
480 U.S. 926 (1987)("context" does not adequately limit scope of
"indecency" regulation).
49. Nor has the Government done anything to obviate the
ambiguities concerning application of the access-provider defense
to service providers, such as Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, who
set up Web sites for other speakers on their servers.  See
Croneberger Test. Decl.  39; 47 U.S.C.  223(e)(1); ALA P.I.
Mem. at 77-78.
50. The Court may "invalidate [for vagueness] a criminal statute
on its face even when it could conceivably have had some valid
applications."  Kolender, 461 U.S. at 358 n.8.
51. See Telecommunications Act of 1996,  561; 142 Cong. Rec.
S694 (daily ed. Feb. 1, 1996) (statement of Sen. Leahy) (Because
conferees "have doubts about [the CDA's] constitutionality," they
"added a section to speed up judicial review to see if the
legislation passes muster.").  See also 142 Cong. Rec. S2095
(daily ed. March 14, 1996) (statement of Sen. Exon) 142 Cong.
Rec. S715 (daily ed. Feb 1, 1996) (statement of Sen. Moynihan)
142 Cong. Rec. S1180 (daily ed. Feb. 9, 1986) (statement of Sen.
Leahy).  Congress made clear that it did not want to repeat its
experience with the dial-a-porn statute, the constitutionality of
which was litigated for over a decade.  See 141 Cong. Rec. S8346
(daily ed. June 14, 1995) (statement of Sen. Biden);  id. S8342
(statement of Sen. Leahy).
52. Thus, to the extent judge-made limitations on facial
challenges are intended to insulate legislative enactments from
broad judicial scrutiny, those policies do not apply where, as
here, Congress has specifically authorized a facial challenge.
53. Plaintiffs also have demonstrated that subsections
(a)(1)(B)(ii) and (d) are overbroad because they prohibit all
minors from receiving material deemed inappropriate for the
youngest users of the Internet.  See ALA P.I. Mem. 45-48; Schmidt
Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 130:24 to 131:7 (material inappropriate
for his son at age 11 will not be harmful at age 17).
54. National Treasury Employees Union v. United States, 990 F.2d
1271, 1280 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (Randolph, J., concurring) (citing
numerous cases), aff'd, 115 S. Ct. 1003 (1995).  See Salerno, 481
U.S. at 745 (noting that "every application" rule applies
"outside the limited context of the First Amendment"); see also
Michael C. Dorf, Facial Challenges to State and Federal Statutes,
46 Stan. L. Rev. 235, 265 (1994).
55. In several cases, the Supreme Court has addressed
overbreadth claims without finding it necessary to determine
first whether the plaintiffs' own expression was or was not
validly regulated.  See, e.g., Board of Airport Comm'rs v. Jews
for Jesus, Inc., 482 U.S. 569, 572, 575-76 (1987) (holding
restriction on expressive activity overbroad and therefore
facially invalid without finding it necessary to rule on
plaintiffs' claim that their own activity was constitutionally
protected); Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better
Environment, 444 U.S. 620, 634 & n.8 (1980) (same).  
56. Plaintiffs do not seek invalidation of the entire CDA. 
Their facial challenge is limited to subsections (a)(1)(B)(ii),
(a)(2) and (d).  Under ordinary principles of severability, see
Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U.S. 678, 684-86 (1987), the
remainder of the CDA may be left intact.  Moreover, plaintiffs
challenge these provisions only insofar as they apply to speech
that is constitutionally protected for adults.  Subsection
(a)(1)(B)(ii) (and hence Subsection (a)(2)) may be left intact
insofar as it proscribes "obscene" communications.  However,
there is no evidence or reason to believe that Congress intended
Subsection (d) -- which does not refer separately to "obscene"
communications -- to address material that is legally obscene,
which it dealt with in other provisions that would render
Subsection (d) superfluous as an anti-obscenity measure.  See CDA
Section 507 (amending 18 U.S.C.  1462 to "clarify" criminal
prohibition on transmitting "obscene" materials by "interactive
computer service"); United States v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 701 (6th
Cir. 1996) (affirming conviction under  1462 and 1465 for
transmitting obscenity by computer).  Therefore, subsection (d)
should be set aside in toto. 
57. Pl. Pro. Find. Part IV.A.  
58. The Supreme Court has observed that a court should
"ordinarily" decide an as-applied challenge before proceeding to
rule on a facial one, Fox, 492 U.S. at 485, and should generally
restrict its remedy to what is sufficient to protect the
litigants, e.g., NTEU, 115 S. Ct. at 1018.  However, in the First
Amendment context, the preference for litigant-specific relief
over facial relief is not an inflexible rule, e.g., Fox, 492 U.S.
at 485; see also Renne v. Geary, 501 U.S. 312, 345 (1991)
(Marshall, J., dissenting), so that in appropriate cases a court
may strike a law on its face even though a narrower remedy would
be sufficient to protect the particular litigant's speech. 
Indeed, the Court has often held laws facially invalid without
ruling on the litigants' alternative claim that the law was also
unconstitutional "as applied" to them.  E.g., Board of Airport
Comm'rs v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U.S. 569 (1987); Houston v.
Hill, 482 U.S. 451 (1987); Schaumberg v. Citizens for a Better
Environment, 444 U.S. 620 (1980).
59."Self-censorship is immune to an `as-applied' challenge, for
it derives from the individual's own actions, not an abuse of
government power."  City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Pub. Co.,
486 U.S. 750, 757 (1988).  See also Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380
U.S. 479, 491 (1965) (persons covered by a law that restricts
expression in vague and overbroad terms should not be expected to
"hammer[] out the structure of the statute piecemeal, with no
likelihood of obviating similar uncertainty for others").
60. Under the terms of the Stipulation entered between the
parties, the Government has retained the right to prosecute any
of the plaintiffs for speech posted online during the pendency of
this proceeding in the event plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary
injunction is denied.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE
Bureau of Political Military Affairs

22 CFR Parts 123 and 126

[Public Notice 2294]

 
Amendment to the International Traffic in Arms <strong>Regulations</strong>

AGENCY: Department of State.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This rule would amend the International Traffic in Arms 
<strong>Regulations</strong> (<strong>ITAR</strong>) by establishing an exemption for the temporary 
export of cryptographic products for personal use. The effect of the 
change would be to ease the burden on U.S. citizens and lawful 
permanent residents who have the need to temporarily export 
cryptographic products when leaving the U.S. for brief periods of time.

EFFECTIVE DATE: February 16, 1996.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:
Rose Biancaniello, Deputy Director for Licensing, Office of Defense 
Trade Controls, Department of State, (703) 875-6643 or FAX (703) 875-
6647.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The U.S. Government has since 1993, at the 
direction of the President, been reviewing the U.S. policy regarding 
the domestic use of, and export controls on, cryptographic technology. 
While U.S. national security and foreign policy compel maintaining 
appropriate export controls on cryptography, the Department of State 
has continued to reform the export control procedures applicable to 
those products incorporating cryptography which are controlled by the 
<strong>ITAR</strong> in Category XIII(b)(1). For example, on September 2, 1994, the 
Department published (at 59 FR 45621) a final rule change which created 
a new Section 124.15. The section provides for a new arrangement by 
which the Department of State may provide approval for category 
XIII(b)(1) cryptography products to be distributed by U.S. 
manufacturers directly to foreign end users without obtaining an 
individual license for each transaction.
    After extensive review, the Department of State has decided to 
further amend the <strong>regulations</strong> to provide for an exemption for the 
temporary export of cryptographic products for personal use. The 
exemption does not apply to other circumstances, for example, those in 
which a person contemplates sales, marketing or demonstration. Nor does 
the exemption apply to exports to destinations listed in Section 126.1 
of the <strong>ITAR</strong> which are prohibited by a United Nations Security Council 
Resolution or to which the export (or for which the issuance of a 

[[Page 6112]]
license for the export) would be prohibited by a U.S. statute (e.g., by 
Section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2780, to countries 
that have been determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts 
of international terrorism, i.e., Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, 
Sudan and Syria).
    This rule amends Part 123 to add a new Section 123.27 to reduce the 
burden on individual users of cryptographic products by providing an 
exemption for the temporary export for personal use of products covered 
by Category XIII(b)(1) when the product remains in the possession of 
the exporter or the possession of another U.S. citizen or lawful 
permanent resident traveling with him/her. For purposes of this 
exemption, a product is considered to be in the possession of the 
exporter if the exporter takes normal precautions to ensure the 
security of the product by locking the product in a hotel room, safe, 
or other comparably secure location; and, while in transit, the 
exporter keeps the product in his/her carry-on luggage or locked in 
baggage accompanying the exporter which has been checked with the 
carrier.
    This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United 
States and thus is excluded from the procedures of Executive Order 
12866 (58 FR 51735) and 5 U.S.C. 553 and 554.
    However, interested parties are invited to submit written comments 
to the Department of State, Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, 
Attn: Regulatory Change, Personal Use Cryptographic Products, Room 200, 
SA-6, Washington, DC 20520-0602.
    This rule affects collection of information subject to the 
Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq), and will serve to 
reduce the burden on exporters by adding an exemption which will remove 
the current requirement for a license.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The record-keeping requirement contained in section 123.27(b) has 
been approved by OMB and has a control number of 1405-0103. An agency 
may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, 
a collection of information unless the collection of information 
displays a valid control number.

List of Subjects

22 CFR Part 123

    Arms and munitions, Exports, Reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements.

22 CFR Part 126

    Arms and munitions, Exports.

    Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, title 22, 
chapter I, subchapter M, of the Code of Federal <strong>Regulations</strong>, is amended 
as set forth below:

PART 123--LICENSES FOR THE EXPORT OF DEFENSE ARTICLES

    1. The authority citation for part 123 continues to read as 
follows:

    Authority: Secs. 2 and 38, Pub. L. 90-629, 90 Stat. 744 (22 
U.S.C. 2752, 2778); E.O. 11958, 42 FR 4311, 3 CFR 1977 Comp. 79; 22 
U.S.C. 2658.

    2. A new Sec. 123.27 is added to read as follows:


Sec. 123.27  Temporary export for personal use of Category XIII(b)(1) 
cryptographic products.

    (a) District Directors of Customs may permit a U.S. citizen or a 
U.S. person who is a lawful permanent resident as defined by 8 U.S.C. 
1101(a)(20) to temporarily export from the United States without a 
license not more than one each of any unclassified Category XIII(b)(1) 
cryptographic hardware product and not more than a single copy of each 
type of unclassified Category XIII(b)(1) cryptographic software product 
provided that:
    (1) The software product(s) are to be used only on a simultaneously 
temporarily exported Category XIII(b)(1) hardware product or a 
simultaneously exported item on the Commerce Control List (CCL); and
    (2) The cryptographic products covered by Category XIII(b)(1) are 
not destined for export to a destination listed in Sec. 126.1 of the 
<strong>ITAR</strong> (22 CFR 126.1) which is prohibited by a United Nations Security 
Council Resolution or to which the export (or for which the issuance of 
a license for the export) would be prohibited by a U.S. statute (e.g., 
by Section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2780, to 
countries that have been determined to have repeatedly provided support 
for acts of international terrorism--currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, 
North Korea, Sudan and Syria); and
    (3)(i) The encryption products remain in the possession of the 
exporting person or the possession of another U.S. citizen or lawful 
permanent resident traveling with him/her, are for their exclusive use 
and not for copying, demonstration, marketing, sale, re-export or 
transfer of ownership or control. The export of cryptographic products 
identified in Category XIII(b)(1) in any other circumstances, for 
example, those in which a person contemplates sales, marketing, or 
demonstration must be licensed in accordance with policies and 
procedures established in this subchapter.
    (ii) Special definition. For purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of 
this section, a product is considered to be in the possession of the 
exporter if:
    (A) The exporter takes normal precautions to ensure the security of 
the product by locking the product in a hotel room, safe, or other 
comparably secure location; and
    (B) While in transit, the exporter keeps the product in his/her 
carry-on luggage or locked in baggage accompanying the exporter which 
has been checked with the carrier; and
    (4) At the time of export from the U.S. and import into the U.S., 
the cryptographic products are with the individual's accompanying 
baggage or effects. They may not be exported or imported in 
unaccompanied baggage, mailed or transmitted by any other means (e.g., 
electronically); and, the cryptographic products must be returned to 
the U.S. at the completion of the stay abroad; and
    (5) The exporter, upon request of a U.S. Customs officer, will 
submit the products to inspection at the time of export and/or import.
    (b) Use of this exemption requires the exporter, in lieu of filing 
a Shippers' Export Declaration, to maintain, for a period of 5 years 
from the date of each temporary export, a record of that temporary 
export and the subsequent import. Included in this record must be a 
self certification that the individual complied with the conditions of 
paragraph (a) of this section and a self certification that he/she has 
no reason to believe that any of the temporarily exported cryptographic 
products were stolen, lost, copied, sold or otherwise compromised or 
transferred while abroad. The record should include the following 
information: A description of the unclassified cryptographic products; 
the countries entered, including the dates of entry and exit for each 
foreign country; and, the dates of temporary export from and subsequent 
import into the United States.
    (c) In any instance where a product exported under this exemption 
is stolen, lost, copied, sold or otherwise compromised or transferred 
while abroad, the exporting person must, within 10 days of his/her 
return to the United States, report the incident to the Department of 
State, Office of Defense Trade Controls, Washington, D.C. 20520-0602. 
Also, any person who knows or has reason to know that cryptographic 
products exported under 

[[Page 6113]]
this exemption are being transferred, exported, or used for any other 
activity which must be licensed or otherwise authorized in writing by 
the Department of State, should immediately inform the Department of 
State, Office of Defense Trade Controls, Washington D.C. 20520-0602.

PART 126--GENERAL POLICIES AND PROVISIONS

    1. The authority citation for part 126 continues to read as 
follows:

    Authority: Secs. 2, 38, 40, 42 and 71, Arms Export Control Act, 
Pub. L. 90-629, 90 Stat. 744 (22 U.S.C. 2752, 2778, 2780, 2791 and 
2797); E.O. 11958, 41 FR 4311; E.O. 11322, 32 FR 119; 22 U.S.C. 
2658; 22 U.S.C. 287c; E.O. 12918, 59 FR 28205.

    2. Section 126.1(a) is amended by designating the three sentences 
of the undesignated paragraph as the third, fourth and fifth sentences 
of paragraph (a) and by adding a new sixth sentence at the end of 
paragraph (a) to read as follows:


Sec. 126.1  Prohibited exports and sales to certain countries.

    (a) * * * With regard to Sec. 123.27 the exemption does not apply 
with respect to articles originating in or for export to countries 
prohibited by a United Nations Security Council Resolution or to which 
the export (or for which the issuance of a license for the export) 
would be prohibited by a U.S. statute (e.g., by Section 40 of the Arms 
Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2780, to countries that have been 
determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts of 
international terrorism, i.e., Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, 
Sudan and Syria).

<title>The Ad Hoc Taxpayer Coalition for Computer Privacy Letter to Gingrich</title>

<body>
<p>
<p>
<center><font size = +1><b>The Ad Hoc Taxpayer Coalition for Computer Privacy</b></font></center>
<p>
<P>
November 8, 1995
<p>
The Honorable Newt Gingrich<br>
Speaker of the House of Representatives<br>
H-232 The Capitol<br>
Washington, DC 20515-6502<br>
<br>
<br>
Dear Mr. Speaker:
<p>
We are writing to express serious concerns about the Administration's efforts to continue to restrict the of computer users at home and abroad to protect their private information over electronic networks through the se of encryption technology. The Administration seems determined to ensure government surveillance of all electronic information and communications. It began with President Clinton's "Clipper Chip," but has not stopped.
<p>
Consumers aren't happy with these proposals, and neither is the business community nor civil libertarians. In fact, it's hard to find anyone supportive outside the Administration except for the that would benefit from the Administration's "proposed relaxation" of the nation's export policy.
<p>
The Administration refuses to let American computer hardware and software companies sell products with good encryption worldwide unless the U.S. Government is guaranteed access to a key that unlocks that information. The Administration is trying to leverage these companies' need to export -- they derive more than half their earnings from sales abroad -- and desire to develop a single product worldwide, to force them to include a feature in products they sell in the U.S. and abroad that will allow government access. Administration officials also have said that if American companies do not 'voluntarily" include such a feature, then they will seek legislation making such a feature mandatory.
<p>
The Administration's approach is the wrong policy for today's marketplace.
<p>
<b>It's anti-consumer.</b>  Computer users will not entrust their sensitive information to computer networks unless its security and privacy are assured. Without good privacy protection, there simply will not be a Global Information Infrastructure -- and America won't be in the lead.
<p>
<b>It's anti-marketplace. </b>There is no consumer demand for encryption products that give the government easy access. The Administration has come forward with a typical big-government approach -- a government designed solution for a government problem. This completely overlooks the realities of a free-market.
<p>
<b>It is anti-American business.</b> The Administration's current policies are seriously harming the continued competitiveness of one of our fastest growing and most successful industries -- the computer hardware and software industry. Computer users are demanding good encryption but American companies are not allowed to supply it. Yet there are hundreds of foreign encryption products manufactured and encryption programs are widely available on the Internet.
<p>
<b>Finally, it is anti-progress.</b> Wishing that there was no encryption available will not make it so. The technology is widely understood and available -- you can't put this genie back in the bottle. Government policies should not encumber the American computing industry as it leads the world technology revolution.

(1) Congress Passes Online Indecency Bill, Clinton Expected to Sign, 
    CDT Plans Court Challenge

By overwhelming margins in both the House and Senate, Congress today (2/1) approved 
legislation to dramatically restrict the First Amendment rights of Internet users.  
With this act of Congress, the very same materials which are legally available today 
in book stores and libraries would be illegal if posted on World Wide Web sites or 
usenet newsgroups. If signed by President Clinton as expected, this bill will transform 
the Internet overnight from the freest communications medium to the most heavily 
regulated medium in the United States. 

CDT believes this legislation is unconstitutional. We are committed to challenging 
it in the courts at the earliest possible opportunity.

Despite the sustained effort over the past 12 months by Senators Leahy (D-VT), 
Feingold (D-WI), and Representatives Chris Cox (R-CA), Rick White (R-WA), and Ron 
Wyden (D-OR) to defeat the bill, the House passed the measure on a vote of 414 - 16, 
while the Senate concurred a few hours later on a vote of 91 - 5. Ironically, the 
vote comes exactly one year to the day that Senator Exon (D-NE) originally introduced 
the proposal (2/1/95).

CONGRESS MAKES CRIMINALS OF MOST INTERNET USERS

The Communications Decency Act, enacted as part of a massive telecommunications 
reform legislation, will impose $250,000 fines and prison terms for anyone who 
posts "indecent" material, including the "7 dirty words", the text of classic 
works of fiction such as The Catcher In The Rye or Ulysses, artwork containing 
images of nudes, or rap lyrics, in a public forum. 

CDT strongly opposes this legislation. We believe the bill threatens the very 
existence of the Internet as a means for free expression, education, and political 
discourse. The bill is an unwarranted, unconstitutional intrusion by the Federal 
government into the private lives of all Americans. 

Although the free speech rights of Internet users and the free flow of information 
online received a major setback today, the battle is far from over.  President Clinton 
is expected to sign the legislation in the coming days.  Several civil liberties and 
public interest advocacy groups, including CDT, People for the American Way, EFF, and 
the ACLU are already preparing to challenge these new restrictions in court.  Other 
affected entities, including commercial content providers, Internet Service Providers, 
and the commercial online services industries, are also expected to mount court 
challenges to this legislation.  CDT is confident that the courts will find the 
Communications Decency Act unconstitutional and reject it outright.

INTERNET COMMUNITY ACTIVISM MADE A CRITICAL DIFFERENCE

Although the CDA passed by Congress today represents a significant threat to the 
viability of the Internet and the free speech rights of individual users, the 
efforts of the Internet.community to mobilize against the bill kept it from being 
a lot worse.  

The Christian Coalition, with the support of House Judiciary Committee Chairman 
Henry Hyde (R-IL), fought hard to hold online service providers criminally liable 
for materials generated by their subscribers. Fortunately, these efforts were not 
successful. Holding providers liable would have forced them to pre-screen all 
material on their networks, or, worse yet, shut down entire parts of their services 
for fear of massive fines and prison sentences. The Christian Coalition was also 
unsuccessful in their efforts to remove provisions encouraging the development and 
deployment of parental control applications. 

Due to the efforts of the 115,000 Internet users who signed the petition against 
the CDA, the more than 20,000 users who in one day flooded Congress with phone 
calls, faxes, and email messages, and those who throughout 1995 regularly called 
their Congresspeople to express concerns about the various proposals, the Internet 
community showed itself to be a true political force with real influence over the 
legislative process.  Although we did not accomplish all of our most important 
objectives, we have become a powerful force.  This is not the last time Congress 
will consider issues vital to the interests of Internet users across the United 
States. We must never loose sight of the fact that, despite the apparent defeat 
today, there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done.

SEVERAL KEY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHTS OF INTERNET USERS

Although a majority of Congress today demonstrated a complete lack of understanding 
of the Internet and the implications of the Communications Decency Act, several 
members deserve credit for standing up for freedom of speech and the free flow of 
information online.  

During the course of the debate over the last year on the CDA, Senators Patrick 
Leahy (D-VT) and Russ Feingold (D-WI), along with Representatives Chris Cox (R-CA), 
Rick White (R-WA), Michael Oxley (R-OH), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Ed Markey (D-MA), 
showed courage and conviction by working to support enlightened alternatives to 
government content restrictions.  These members have shown themselves to be friends 
of the Internet, and we look forward to working with them on other issues which lie 
ahead.

ANALYSIS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT PASSED TODAY

The legislation approved today was not changed from a previous version released 
December 21, 1995 (See CDT Policy Post No. 33).  Briefly, the proposal contains 
several troubling elements.  Among other things, the bill: 

* Relies on the vague and blatantly unconstitutional "indecency" 
  standard (Sec 502 (a) - (c))

* Prohibits sending "indecent" material directly to a minor or making 
  indecent material available for display in a manner available to a 
  minor (including World Wide Web pages, ftp sites, or usenet 
  newsgroups) (Sec 502 (d)).

* No longer contains the provision of the Cox/Wyden/White bill 
  prohibiting the FCC from imposing content or other regulations on the  
  Internet or other interactive media.

* Would allow states to impose additional restrictions on non-commercial 
  activities such as free-nets, BBS's, and non-profit content providers 
  (Sec 502 (h)).

* Creates a new crime for the solicitation of minors using a computer, 
  the US mail, or any other means of interstate or foreign commerce (Sec 
  508).

The full text of the bill, along with other relevant background information 
(including final vote tallies when available) can be found at CDT's Internet 
Censorship Issues Web Page (http://www.cdt.org/cda.html).

our progress as information becomes available.

COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF


                      PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

          1.  During much of this century the mass media,
particularly radio and television, have been characterized by a
limited number of speakers transmitting programming and
information to essentially passive audiences.  The communications
medium of the twenty-first century -- the Internet and
"cyberspace" generally -- is changing that, and will allow
hundreds of millions of individuals to engage in interactive
communication, on a national and global scale never before
possible.  The public square of the past -- with pamphleteering,
soap boxes, and vigorous debate -- is being replaced by the
Internet, which enables average citizens to participate in
national discourse, publish a newspaper, distribute an electronic
pamphlet to the world, and generally communicate to and with a
broader audience than ever before possible.  It also enables
average citizens to gain access to a vast and literally world-
wide range of information, while simultaneously protecting their
privacy, because in this new medium individuals receive only the
communications they affirmatively request.
          2.  In enacting the Communications Decency Act of 1996
(to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  223) (the "Act"), Congress
acknowledged that the Internet represents "an extraordinary
advance in the availability of educational and informational
resources to our citizens," and acknowledged that interactive
computer services "offer users a great degree of control over the
information that they receive."  Congress therefore declared
"[i]t is the policy of the United States . . . to promote the
continued development of the Internet and other interactive
computer services; [and] to preserve the vibrant and competitive
free market that presently exists for the Internet and other
interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State
regulation."  Act  509 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  230). 
Unfortunately, as we will show, provisions of the Act that were
intended only to protect minors from communications deemed
inappropriate for them will have the effect, perhaps unintended,
of depriving adults of communications that are appropriate, and
indisputably constitutionally protected, for them.  Because of
the way the Internet works, the Act's prohibition of
communications that may be deemed "indecent" or "patently
offensive" for minors will effectively ban those same
communications between adults, reducing the adult population in
cyberspace to only what is appropriate for minors.  The banned
speech includes valuable works of literature and art, information
about health and medical issues, and examples of popular culture. 
It also includes robust human discourse about politics, current
events, and personal matters that may at times include harsh,
provocative, or even vulgar language, all of which is
constitutionally protected for adults.
          3.  Plaintiffs represent a broad range of individuals
and entities from the computer and communications industries and
the general public who are harmed by the Act.  Plaintiffs include
publishers and creators of content on the Internet; "online
services," "Internet service providers," libraries, and others
who provide access or connection to the Internet; and speakers,
listeners, and users on the Internet.  The Act's effective ban of
a broad category of communication that is constitutionally
protected for adults directly harms the First Amendment rights of
plaintiffs, and of the tens of millions of adult speakers and
listeners who are "online" and linked through this new
communications medium.  Plaintiffs also include parents, who seek
to protect the rights of parents to decide what is appropriate
for their children to receive through interactive computer
communications.
          4.  The speech at issue in this case does not include
obscenity, child pornography, harassing speech, speech intended
to entice or lure minors into inappropriate activity, or other
speech that lacks First Amendment protection even for adults. 
This complaint does not challenge governmental regulation of
those categories of non-protected speech, and the relief sought
herein will not affect the government's ability to prosecute the
communication of those categories of speech, all of which are
already prohibited by existing law. 
          5.  The most sweeping provision of the Act, Section
502(2) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  223(d)), prohibits the
"display" of material deemed "patently offensive" "in a manner
available to a person under 18 years of age" (emphasis added). 
That provision is subject to certain defenses, which the sponsor
of the Act and Congress apparently believed would enable speakers
to restrict access by minors while simultaneously permitting
access by adults.  But those defenses, which were merely lifted
from the "dial-a-porn" laws, simply do not work in the quite
different medium of cyberspace.  Because of the manner in which
information is stored, transmitted, and received on the Internet,
this provision has the (perhaps unintended) result of banning
speech between adults that is suitable and constitutionally
protected for adults.
          6.  The Act is also unconstitutional because there are
alternative ways of protecting minors from material inappropriate
for them that would not abridge the First Amendment rights of
adults, and would be more effective in protecting minors than the
mechanism Congress imposed.  The speaker-based blocking required
by the Act will not protect minors from access to words and
images posted on the Internet abroad by foreign speakers, who are
not effectively subject to prosecution under the Act, or even by
domestic speakers who intentionally or inadvertently violate the
Act.  But user-based blocking technology enables parents and
other users to block or screen whatever words or images they deem
inappropriate, regardless of where posted, at little or no cost. 
For these reasons, every application of the Act unnecessarily and
unconstitutionally abridges the First Amendment rights of adults,
and does so even though there are less drastic alternatives that
would be more protective of minors.

                     JURISDICTION AND VENUE

          7.  This case arises under the Constitution and laws of
the United States and presents a federal question within this
Court's jurisdiction under Article III of the Constitution and 28
U.S.C.  1331.
          8.  This Court has authority to grant declaratory
relief pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C.
 2201.
          9.  Under  561 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996
("Telecommunications Act"), of which the Communications Decency
Act is a part, this action is required to be heard by a three-
judge court convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2284.
          10.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C.
 1391(e).

                              FACTS


   Creation of the Internet and the Development of Cyberspace

          31.  The Internet is not a physical or tangible entity. 
It is a giant network which interconnects innumerable smaller
groups of linked computer networks:  a network of networks.  This
is best understood if one considers what a linked group of
computers -- referred to here as a "network" -- is, and what it
does.  Small networks are now ubiquitous (and are often called
"local area networks").  For example, in many United States
Courthouses, computers are linked to each other for the purpose
of exchanging files and messages (and to share equipment such as
printers).  These are networks.  In the language of the Act,
these networks would each be termed an "interactive computer
service."
          32.  Some networks are "closed" networks, not linked to
other computers or networks (although the Act still directly
applies to such closed local area networks).  Many networks,
however, are connected to other networks, which are in turn
connected to other networks in a manner which permits each
computer in any network to communicate with computers on any
other network in the system.  This global web of linked networks
and computers is the Internet.
          33.  This amalgam of computers and computer networks --
some owned by governmental and public institutions, some owned by
non-profit organizations, and some privately owned -- lacks any
central control or supervision.  The resulting whole is a
decentralized, unrestricted global medium of communications -- or
"cyberspace" -- that links individuals, institutions,
corporations, and governments around the world.  This
communications medium allows any of the literally tens of
millions of people with access to the Internet to exchange ideas,
research, software, poetry, images, literature, sound, or simple
electronic mail with others on the Internet.  These
communications can occur virtually instantaneously, and can be
directed either to specific individuals, to a broader group of
individuals interested in a particular subject, or to the world
as a whole.
          34.  The Internet had its origins in 1969 as an
experimental project of the Advanced Research Project Agency
("ARPA").  First called ARPANET, the network linked computers and
computer networks owned by the military, defense contractors, and
university laboratories conducting defense-related research.  The
network later allowed researchers across the country to access
directly and to use extremely powerful supercomputers located at
a few key universities and laboratories.  As it evolved far
beyond its research origins in the United States to encompass
universities, corporations, and individuals around the world, the
ARPANET came to be called the "DARPA Internet," and finally just
the "Internet."
          35.  From its inception, the network was designed to be
a decentralized, self-maintaining series of redundant links
between computers and computer networks, capable of rapidly
transmitting communications without direct human involvement or
control, and with the automatic ability to re-route
communications if one or more individual links were damaged or
otherwise unavailable.  Among other goals, this redundant, self-
healing system of linked computers was designed to allow vital
research and communications to continue even if portions of the
network were damaged.
          36.  To achieve this resilient nationwide (and
ultimately global) communications medium, the ARPANET encouraged
the creation of multiple links to and from each computer (or
computer network) on the network.  Thus, a computer located in
Washington, D.C., might be linked (usually using dedicated
telephone lines) to other computers in neighboring states or on
the Eastern seaboard.  Each of those computers would in turn be
linked to numerous other computers, which themselves would be
linked to other computers.
          37.  A communication sent over this redundant series of
linked computers could travel any of dozens of routes to its
destination.  Thus, a message sent from a computer in Washington,
D.C., to a computer in Palo Alto, California, might first be sent
to a computer in Philadelphia, and then be forwarded to a
computer in Pittsburgh, and then to Chicago, Denver, and Salt
Lake City, before finally reaching Palo Alto.  If the message
could not travel along that path (because of military attack,
simple technical malfunction, or other reason), the message would
automatically (without human intervention or even knowledge) be
re-routed, perhaps, from Washington, D.C. to Richmond, and then
to Atlanta, New Orleans, Dallas, Albuquerque, Los Angeles, and
finally to Palo Alto.  This type of transmission, and re-routing,
would likely occur in a matter of seconds.
          38.  At the same time that ARPANET was maturing (it
subsequently ceased to exist), similar decentralized networks
developed to link universities, research facilities, businesses,
and individuals around the world.  These other formal or loose
networks included BITNET, CSNET, FIDONET, and USENET. 
Eventually, each of these networks (many of which were
overlapping) were themselves linked together, allowing users of
any computers linked to any one of the networks to transmit
communications to users of computers on other networks.  It is
this series of linked networks (themselves linking computers and
computer networks) that is commonly known today as the Internet.
          39.  No entity -- academic, corporate, governmental, or
non-profit -- controls, governs, or runs the Internet.  It exists
and functions solely as a result of the fact that hundreds of
thousands of separate operators of computers and computer
networks independently decided to use a common data transfer
protocol to exchange communications and information with other
computers (which in turn exchange communications and information
with still other computers).  There is no centralized storage
location, control point, or communications channel for the
Internet, and it would be impossible for any single entity to
regulate the information conveyed on the Internet.
          40.  The nature of the Internet is such that it is
impossible to determine its size.  However, it is indisputable
that the Internet has experienced extraordinary growth in the
past few years.  In 1981, fewer than 300 computers were linked to
the Internet, and by 1989, the number stood at fewer than 90,000
computers.  By 1993, however, over 1,000,000 computers were
linked.  Today, it is estimated that over 9,400,000 host
computers worldwide are linked to the Internet, and this count
does not include the tens of millions of personal computers used
by individuals to access the Internet using modems (as detailed
below).  In all, reasonable estimates are that over 40 million
individuals around the world can and do access the enormously
flexible communication medium of the Internet.  That figure is
expected to grow to 200 million Internet users by the year 1999.

               How Individuals Access the Internet

          41.  Individuals have a wide variety of avenues to
access cyberspace in general, and the Internet in particular.  In
terms of physical access, there are two common methods to
establish an actual link to the Internet.  First, an individual
can use a computer or computer terminal that is directly (and
usually permanently) connected to a computer network that is
itself directly or indirectly connected to the Internet.  Second,
an individual can use a "personal computer" with a "modem" to
connect over a telephone line to a larger computer or computer
network that is itself directly or indirectly connected to the
Internet.  As detailed below, both direct and modem connections
are made available to individuals by a wide variety of academic,
governmental, or commercial entities.
          42.  Students, faculty, researchers, and others
affiliated with the vast majority of colleges and universities in
the United States can access the Internet through their
educational institutions.  Such access is often via direct
connection using computers located in campus libraries, offices,
or computer centers, or may be through telephone access using a
modem from a student's or professor's campus or off-campus
location.  Internet access is considered to be so important to
the modern educational process that many colleges and
universities install "ports" or outlets for direct network
connections in each dormitory room or provide access via
computers located in common areas in dormitories.  Such access
enables students and professors to use information and content
provided by the college or university itself, and to use the vast
amount of research resources and other information available on
the Internet worldwide.
          43.  Similarly, Internet resources and access are
sufficiently important to many corporations and other employers
that those employers link their office computer networks to the
Internet and provide employees with direct or modem access to the
office network (and thus to the Internet).  Such access is
especially important, for example, to any corporation involved in
scientific or medical research or manufacturing to enable
corporate employees to exchange information and ideas with
academic researchers in their fields.
          44.  Individuals who lack access to the Internet
through their schools or employers still have a variety of ways
they can access the Internet.  Many communities across the
country have established "free-nets" or community networks to
provide their citizens with a local link to the Internet (and to
provide local-oriented content and discussion groups).  The first
such community network, the Cleveland Free-Net Community Computer
System, was established in 1986, and free-nets now exist in
scores of communities as diverse as Richmond, Virginia,
Tallahassee, Florida, Seattle, Washington, and San Diego,
California.  Individuals typically can access free-nets at little
or no cost via modem connection or by using computers available
in community buildings.  Free-nets are often operated by a local
library, educational institution, or non-profit community group.
          45.  Individuals can also access the Internet through
many local libraries.  Libraries often offer patrons use of
computers that are linked to the Internet.  In addition, some
libraries offer telephone modem access to the libraries'
computers, which are themselves connected to the Internet. 
Increasingly, patrons are using library services and resources
without ever physically entering the library itself.  Such direct
or modem access is typically provided by libraries at no cost to
the individual user.
          46.  Individuals can also access the Internet by
patronizing an increasing number of storefront "computer coffee
shops," where customers -- while they drink their coffee -- can
use computers provided by the shop to access the Internet.  Such
Internet access is typically provided by the shop for a small
hourly fee.
          47.  Individuals can also access the Internet through
commercial and non-commercial "Internet service providers" that
typically offer modem telephone access to a computer or computer
network linked to the Internet.  Many such providers -- including
the members of plaintiff Commercial Internet Exchange Association
-- are commercial entities offering Internet access for a modest
monthly or hourly fee.  Some Internet service providers, however,
are non-profit organizations that offer free or very low cost
access to the Internet.  For example, the International Internet
Association offers free modem access to the Internet upon
request.  Also, an increasing number of trade or other non-profit
associations offer Internet access as a service to members.
          48.  Another simple and common way that individuals can
access the Internet is through one of the major national
commercial "online services" such as America Online, Apple's
eWorld, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, or Prodigy.  These
online services offer nationwide computer networks (so that
subscribers can dial-in to a local telephone number), and the
services provide extensive and well organized content within
their own proprietary computer networks.  In addition to allowing
access to the extensive content available within each online
service, the services also allow subscribers to link to the much
larger resources of the Internet.  Full access to the online
service (including access to the Internet) can be obtained for
modest monthly or hourly fees.  The major commercial online
services have almost twelve million individual subscribers across
the United States.
          49.  In addition to using the national commercial
online services, individuals can also access the Internet using
some (but not all) of the thousands of local dial-in computer
services, often called "bulletin board systems" or "BBSs."  With
an investment of as little as $2,000.00 and the cost of a
telephone line, individuals, non-profit organizations, advocacy
groups, and businesses can offer their own dial-in computer
"bulletin board" service where friends, members, subscribers, or
customers can exchange ideas and information.  BBSs range from
single computers with only one telephone line into the computer
(allowing only one user at a time), to single computers with many
telephone lines into the computer (allowing multiple simultaneous
users), to multiple linked computers each servicing multiple
dial-in telephone lines (allowing multiple simultaneous users). 
Some (but not all) of these BBS systems offer direct or indirect
links to the Internet.  Some BBS systems charge individuals a
nominal fee for access, while many others are free to the
individual users. 
          50.  Although commercial access to the Internet is
growing rapidly, many individual users of the Internet -- such as
college students and staff -- do not individually pay for access
(except to the extent, for example, the cost of computer services
is a component of college tuition).  These and other Internet
users can access the Internet without any requirement that they
provide a credit card or other form of payment.
          51.  In part because the Internet is an unregulated
"network of networks" with literally millions of access points
and tens of millions of users, individual Internet users often do
not have their own "username" or identification code that would
indicate to others on the Internet the identity of the user. 
Many users access the Internet anonymously or through a method
that would not allow for clear identification by a remote content
provider.

            Methods to Communicate over the Internet

          52.  Once an individual has access to the Internet,
there are a wide variety of different methods of communication
and information exchange over the network.  These numerous
methods of communication and information retrieval are constantly
evolving and are therefore difficult to categorize concisely. 
The most common methods of communications on the Internet (as
well as within the major online services) can be roughly grouped
into six categories:  one-to-one messaging (such as "e-mail"),
one-to-many messaging (such as "listserv"), distributed message
databases (such as "USENET newsgroups"), real time communication
(such as "Internet Relay Chat"), real time remote computer
utilization (such as "telnet"), and remote information retrieval
(such as "ftp," "gopher," and the "World Wide Web").  Most of
these methods of communication can be used to transmit text,
data, computer programs, sound, or visual images.
          53.  One-to-one messaging.  The simplest method of
communication on the Internet is via electronic mail, or "e-
mail," the modern equivalent to a first class letter.  An
individual can address and transmit a message to one or more
specific other individuals.  E-mail on the Internet is not routed
through any central control point, and can take numerous and
varying paths to the recipients.  Unlike postal mail, simple e-
mail is not "sealed" or secure, and can be accessed or viewed on
intermediate computers between the sender and recipient (unless
the message is encrypted).
          54.  One-to-many messaging.  The Internet also contains
automatic mailing list services (such as "listserv") that allow
simple and efficient communications about particular subjects of
interest.  For example, individuals can subscribe to a "listserv"
mailing list on a particular topic of interest to them.  The
individual can submit messages on the topic to the listserv that
are automatically forwarded (via e-mail) to anyone who has
subscribed to the mailing list.  A recipient of such a message
can reply to the message and have the reply also distributed to
everyone on the mailing list.  This service provides the
capability to keep abreast of developments or events in a
particular subject area.  Most listserv-type mailing lists
automatically forward all incoming messages to all mailing list
subscribers.  There are thousands of such mailing list services
on the Internet, collectively with hundreds of thousands of
subscribers.
          55.  Distributed message databases.  Similar in
function to listservs -- but quite different in how
communications are transmitted -- are distributed message
databases such as "USENET newsgroups."  Like listservs,
newsgroups are open discussions and exchanges on particular
topics.  Users, however, need not subscribe to the discussion
mailing list in advance, but can instead access the database at
any time.  An individual user can post a message to a newsgroup,
and the message is then automatically forwarded to all other
computers that furnish access to the newsgroups (but not to any
individual users).  The messages are temporarily stored on each
receiving computer, where they are available for review and
response.  The messages are automatically and periodically purged
from each system to make room for new messages.  Responses to
messages -- like the original messages -- are automatically
distributed to all other computers receiving the newsgroup. 
There are newsgroups on more than fifteen thousand different
subjects.  In 1994, approximately 70,000 messages were posted to
newsgroups each day, and those messages were distributed to the
approximately 190,000 computers or computer networks that
participate in the USENET newsgroup system.  Messages posted to
newsgroups are not stored on or channelled through any central
computer or location.
          56.  Real time communication.  In addition to
transmitting messages that can be later read or accessed,
individuals on the Internet can engage in an immediate dialog --
in "real time" -- with other individuals on the Internet.  In its
simplest forms, "talk" allows one-to-one communications and
"Internet Relay Chat" allows two or more individuals to type
messages to each other that almost immediately appear on the
other individuals' computer screens.  In addition, commercial
online services such as America Online, CompuServe, eWorld, the
Microsoft Network, and Prodigy have their own "chat" systems
allowing their members to converse. 
          57.  Real time remote computer utilization.  Another
method to utilize information on the Internet is to access and
control remote computers using "telnet."  For example, using
telnet, a researcher at a university would be able to utilize the
computing power of a supercomputer located at a different
university.  A student can use telnet to connect to a remote
library to access the library's online card catalog program.  Or,
individuals can link via telnet to a computer to interact
directly and communicate with other users linked to the same
computer.  Accessing a computer via telnet occurs in "real time,"
and content and communication accessed via telnet is often
created only at the time of the communication.
          58.  Remote information retrieval.  The final major
category of communication may be the most important and well
known use of the Internet -- the search for and retrieval of
information located on remote computers.  There are numerous
methods to locate and retrieve information on the Internet.  A
simple method uses "ftp" (or file transfer protocol) to list the
names of computer files available on a remote computer, and to
transfer one or more of those files to an individual's local
computer.  Another approach uses a program and format named
"gopher" to guide an individual's search through the resources
available on a remote computer.  A third approach, and fast
becoming the most well known on the Internet, is the "World Wide
Web."  The Web utilizes a "hypertext" formatting language called
hypertext markup language (HTML), and programs that "browse" the
Web can display HTML documents containing text, images, and
sound.  Any HTML document can include links to other types of
information or resources, so that while viewing an HTML document
that, for example, describes resources available on the Internet,
an individual can "click" using a computer mouse on the
description of the resource and be immediately connected to the
resource itself.  Such "hyperlinks" allow information to be
accessed and organized in very flexible ways, and allow
individuals to locate and efficiently view related information
even if the information is stored on numerous computers all
around the world.
          59.  With the exception of point-to-point mail, no
information flows through cyberspace to a particular individual
unless the individual requests the information.  Listservs,
newsgroups, chat lines, telnet, ftp, gopher and the World Wide
Web all require an affirmative request by the Internet user prior
to the user receiving information over the Internet.  Further-
more, when a user makes such an affirmative request it is usually
clear what type of content will be delivered.  Thus, unlike radio
or television, there is no significant risk that a user will be
"assaulted" with unsolicited and undesired content.
          60.  The vast majority of transmissions of content from
specific sites on the Internet are in response to electronic
requests the user could not have anticipated more than a few
seconds or moments before making the request.  Because
information is located on millions of computers around the world,
with no central organization or control, a user cannot possibly
know which computers might have useful information until starting
a search.  Instead, the user could access any of dozens of
different search databases, obtain a list of sites that might be
of interest, and then immediately link to one or more of the
sites.  Indeed, the very theory of "hyperlinks" and the hypertext
markup language (HTML) (the foundation of the World Wide Web) is
that the user can jump from site to site to site without ever
needing to know where physically in the world the next site is
located.  Thus, there is no way for a user to pre-register with
every computer that might contain useful content on a particular
topic.  Moreover, when an individual is researching a topic on
the Internet, he or she might access dozens of newsgroups, telnet
computers, and ftp, gopher, and Web sites around the world in a
matter of minutes.  If a researcher was required to request
access from content providers prior to actually viewing the
information (and prove to the provider that the researcher was
not a minor), the Internet would be transformed from a dynamic
and instantaneous content searching tool into a cumbersome,
multi-step, much slower, and much less useful research tool.  The
vibrancy and immediacy that sparked the Internet's recent
extraordinary expansion and development would be lost.
          61.  The inability to predict where on the Internet a
user would want to access information is not limited to research,
and applies equally to any attempt by a user to access
information on the Internet when the individual does not know in
advance the precise location of that information.  There are
millions of computers on the Internet that contain content, and
it would be practically and economically impossible for the tens
of millions of Internet users to pre-register with each of those
millions of content sites, and equally impossible for those
millions of content sites to maintain and instantaneously update
lists of registered users.
          62.  For both the speaker and the listener,
communications on the Internet bear virtually no similarity to
communications on television and radio.  With radio and
television, the number of speakers is limited by the available
spectrum, the ability to speak is limited by the high cost of
speaking, and listeners are merely passive recipients of the
communications.  With the Internet, the number of speakers is
boundless, anyone can speak for pennies a day (or for free at his
or her public library), and listeners can respond and engage the
speaker in an interactive and on-going dialogue.  Furthermore,
unlike television and radio, on the Internet viewers and
listeners generally receive only the communications they
affirmatively request, and are not a passive or "captive"
audience.  Moreover, unlike with television and radio, on the
Internet a speaker can reach the entire world (at no additional
cost) yet at the same time can direct his or her speech to
individuals who share an interest in a particular subject.  In
the twenty-first century, the Internet -- if allowed to flourish
unhindered by government censorship -- can revive the now-little-
used public square and convert it into a global medium of
communication and discourse.

                     Content on the Internet

          63.  The diversity of content on the Internet is as
broad as the Internet itself.  Content can be found on millions
of computers worldwide, and ranges from academic research to art
to humor to literature to medical information to music to news to
virtually anything else.  Moreover, at any one time, the Internet
serves as the communication medium for literally tens of
thousands of global conversations, political debates, and social
dialogues.  For example, on the Internet, one can view the full
text of the Bible, all of the works of Shakespeare, and numerous
other classic works of literature.  One can browse through
paintings from museums around the world, or view in close-up
detail the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, or see the latest
photographs transmitted by the Jupiter space probe.  One can even
hear pieces of music or view clips of movies and videos over the
Internet.
          64.  There is a significant amount of content on the
Internet that could be considered "indecent" for minors in some
communities in the United States, but which most people would
consider to be extremely valuable and appropriate for adults, and
which, in any event, is constitutionally protected for adults. 
Such content includes, for example, great works of art and
literature (containing depictions and descriptions of nudes and
sexual conduct), examples of modern popular culture (containing
popular music, lyrics, movie images, or literature with sexual
content), medical information (containing depictions and
descriptions relating to child birth, sexually transmitted
diseases, and sexually related medical conditions), and
historical and scientific information (containing, for example,
accounts of historic criminal trials or other historical,
sociological, and anthropological works).  Such content, and
other content typically provided by non-commercial providers, is
effectively banned by the Act.
          65.  The fear that some communities in the United
States would conclude that this type of valuable material is
"indecent" for minors is well founded.  Communities across the
country have banned or sought to ban classic works of literature,
such as Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck, As I Lay Dying by
William Faulkner, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark
Twain, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain, Catcher in the
Rye by J.D. Salinger, and I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings by Maya
Angelou, as "indecent" for minors.  Even the American Heritage
Dictionary and parts of the Bible have been attacked as being
"indecent" for minors.  All of these works (some of which are
available in whole or in part on the Internet), and works with
similar content, are effectively banned by the Act.
          66.  In addition to the above type of content that is
banned by the Act, a tremendous amount of common human discourse
is banned by the Act.  In the course of conversations,
discussions and debates, many citizens use language and imagery
that in some communities would be viewed as "indecent" for
minors.  Vigorous and heated debate often occurs with harsh or
vulgar words.  Many people, and many speakers on the Internet,
use in common discourse words that describe "sexual or excretory
activities or organs" in terms that might be deemed to be
"patently offensive" for minors.  The use of vulgar words in a
dialog with friends -- which would be perfectly legal over the
telephone or in a letter or on a basketball court -- would be
illegal under the Act if sent over the Internet.
          67.  There are many examples on the Internet of
valuable content that can be displayed only subject to the threat
of criminal liability and prosecution.
          68.  For example, a content provider would reasonably
fear prosecution under the Act for the unrestricted display of
written descriptions of sexual intercourse.
          69.  There are available on the Internet important
works of literature that include descriptions of sexual
intercourse.
          70.  Similarly, a content provider would reasonably
fear prosecution under the Act for the unrestricted display of
images of nude men and/or women.
          71.  There are available on the Internet numerous
important works of art -- paintings, drawings and photographs by
great masters and modern artists alike -- that depict nude men
and/or women.  An example of such a work of art is Manet's
Olympia.
          72.  Similarly, content providers would reasonably fear
prosecution under the Act for engaging in a vigorous online
debate in which there is repeated use of the "seven dirty words"
at issue in the decision in Federal Communications Commission v.
Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978).
          73.  There are on the Internet -- on a daily basis --
vigorous political, social, and other dialogues and debates that
include unrestricted use of one or more of the "seven dirty
words."
          74.  Similarly, a content provider would reasonably
fear prosecution under the Act for the display on a World Wide
Web "home page" of vulgar statements of the type at issue in
Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971).
          75.  The Supreme Court has specifically held that the
use of the vulgar statement in Cohen is protected expression,
even when displayed in public areas when children are present.
          76.  Similarly, a content provider would reasonably
fear prosecution under the Act for the display of a parody that
makes explicit assertions about the "sexual or excretory
activities or organs" of a well known public figure, as was at
issue in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46 (1988).
          77.  The Supreme Court specifically held in Falwell
that a parody that made explicit assertions about the "sexual or
excretory activities or organs" of a well known public figure is
protected expression.
          78.  Similarly, a content provider would reasonably
fear prosecution under the Act for the unrestricted display of
detailed information concerning birth control and the
transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
          79.  The Supreme Court specifically held in Bolger v.
Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60 (1983), that such
communications are protected expression and can be mailed,
unsolicited, into homes.
          80.  There is a tremendous amount of valuable content
on the Internet that is constitutionally protected for adults,
but is nevertheless subject to prosecution under the Act.

                 The Statutory Language At Issue

          81.  Signed into law on February 8, 1996, the
Communications Decency Act criminalizes the display and
distribution of constitutionally protected expressive material.
          82.  The Act contains two primary criminal provisions. 
Violation of either provision is a felony, punishable by as much
as two years in prison and substantial fines.  
          83.  Section 502(2) of the Act, to be codified at 47
U.S.C.  223(d), broadly prohibits knowingly using any
"interactive computer service" to send to a specific person or
persons under 18 years of age, or to "display," "in a manner
available to" a person under 18, certain "patently offensive"
communications.  Section 502(2) provides, in pertinent part:
(d) Whoever--

   (1) in interstate or foreign communications
   knowingly--

         (A) uses an interactive computer service to
      send to a specific person or persons under 18
      years of age, or

         (B) uses any interactive computer service to
      display in a manner available to a person under
      18 years of age, 

   any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image,
   or other communication that, in context, depicts or
   describes, in terms patently offensive as measured
   by contemporary community standards, sexual or
   excretory activities or organs, regardless of
   whether the user of such service placed the call or
   initiated the communication; or

   (2) knowingly permits any telecommunications
   facility under such person's control to be used for
   an activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with the
   intent that it be used for such activity, 

shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, or
imprisoned not more than two years, or both.

Act  502(2).
          84.  "Interactive computer service" is defined as "any
information service, system, or access software provider that
provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a
computer server, including specifically a service or system that
provides access to the Internet and such systems operated or
services offered by libraries or educational institutions."  Act
 502(2) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  223(h)(2)) referring to
Act  509 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  230(e)(2)).
          85.  The terms "patently offensive," "contemporary
community standards," and "display" are nowhere defined in the
Act.
          86.  Another section of the Act, Section 502(1), to be
codified at 47 U.S.C.  223(a)(1)(B), prohibits and criminalizes
the use of a "telecommunications device" knowingly to make or
create and "initiate[] the transmission of, any comment, request,
suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which is
. . . indecent, knowing that the recipient of the communication
is under 18 years of age."  Another provision of the same section
makes it a crime to "knowingly permit[] any telecommunications
facility under [a person's] control to be used for any activity
prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be used for
such activity."  Act  502(1) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.
 223(a)(2)).
          87.  "Telecommunications device" is defined to exclude
an "interactive computer service."  Act  502(2) (to be codified
at 47 U.S.C.  223(h)(1)(B)).
          88.  The term "indecent" is not defined.
          89.  The Act establishes several defenses a defendant
may assert in a criminal prosecution under the Act.  First, no
person shall be held to have violated subsection (a) or (d)
solely for providing access or connection to or from a
facility, system, or network not under that person's
control, including transmission, downloading,
intermediate storage, access software, or other related
capabilities that are incidental to providing such
access or connection that does not include the creation
of the content of the communication.

Act  502(2) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  223(e)(1)).
          90.  The phrase "not under that person's control" is
nowhere defined in the Act.
          91.  This defense is not available "to a person who is
a conspirator with an entity actively involved in the creation or
knowing distribution of communications that violate this section,
or who knowingly advertises the availability of such
communications."  Id. (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  223(e)(2)). 
Nor is this defense available to "a person who provides access or
connection to a facility, system, or network engaged in the
violation . . . that is owned or controlled by such person."  Id.
(to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  223(e)(3)).  The level or nature
of control is not defined.
          92.  In addition, the Act provides a defense to a
criminal prosecution under (a)(1)(B) or (d), or under (a)(2) for
use of a facility for an activity under (a)(1)(B), if the
defendant
(A)   has taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective,
and appropriate actions under the circumstances to
restrict or prevent access by minors to a communication
specified in such subsections, which may involve any
appropriate measures to restrict minors from such
communications, including any method which is feasible
under available technology; or

(B)   has restricted access to such communication by
requiring use of a verified credit card, debit account,
adult access code, or adult personal identification
number.

Id. (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  223(e)(5)).  Congress did not
provide any details as to what might be considered a "good faith,
reasonable, effective, and appropriate action[]."  Congress did
allow the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") to promulgate
nonbinding guidelines as to what might be an "appropriate
action," but it now appears that even those guidelines will not
be issued until sometime in 1997 at the earliest, and compliance
with the guidelines will not insulate speakers from prosecution
or conviction under the Act.
          93.  Congress made no findings in connection with
enacting Section 502 of the Act.  Congress made no findings as to
its purpose or interest in criminalizing online communication of
"indecent" or "patently offensive" materials to, or that would be
available to, persons under age 18.  In considering the Act,
Congress made no inquiry into or findings regarding the extent to
which such materials were available to persons under 18. 
Congress made no inquiry into or findings whether the means
Congress chose to address whatever interest it had would
substantially further that interest.  Congress made no inquiry
into or findings whether any less restrictive means would
substantially further its interest.
          94.  In another section of the Act, however, Congress
did make the following relevant findings:
   (1) The rapidly developing array of Internet and
other interactive computer services available to
individual Americans represent an extraordinary advance
in the availability of educational and informational
resources to our citizens.

   (2) These services offer users a great degree of
control over the information that they receive, as well
as the potential for even greater control in the future
as technology develops.

   (3) The Internet and other interactive computer
services offer a forum for a true diversity of
political discourse, unique opportunities for cultural
development, and myriad avenues for intellectual
activity.

   (4) The Internet and other interactive computer
services have flourished, to the benefit of all
Americans, with a minimum of government regulation.

   (5) Increasingly Americans are relying on
interactive media for a variety of political,
educational, cultural, and entertainment services.

Act  509 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  230(a)) (emphasis
added).

              The Impact of the Act on the Internet

          95.  Because of the realities of the Internet, the Act
effects a total ban on certain constitutionally protected speech
to adults.  The Act reduces discourse on major portions of the
Internet to that which is appropriate for a young child.
          96.  Virtually all of the tens of millions of users of
the Internet -- except those who at all times stand mute in the
discourse that occurs on the Internet -- are content providers
who are subject to the terms of the Act.  An individual is a
content provider subject to the Act if he sends a single e-mail,
or participates in a listserv discussion, or contributes to a
USENET newsgroup, or responds to a survey on the World Wide Web,
or establishes a personal "home page" on the Web, or converses
with a friend through a real time service, or simply places a
file in a publicly available area of a computer or network.  
          97.  In other words, virtually any use of the Internet
makes someone a content provider subject to the criminal
penalties of the Act.  Commercial content providers -- who
typically require a credit card for users' payment -- may be able
to use the credit card defense allowed by the Act.  But for non-
commercial content providers, who are responsible for a major
part of communications on the Internet, there is no practical way
the speaker can control who can access the message.  Thus, for
the vast majority of speech on the Internet, it is impossible for
the speaker to prevent the speech from being "display[ed] in a
manner available" to a person under 18.  Act  502(2).
          98.  Because of this impossibility, Section 502(2) of
the Act effectively requires that almost all discourse on the
Internet be at a level suitable for young children.  This
provision has the effect of a flat ban on an entire category of
constitutionally protected speech between adults.
          99.  As used by millions of people daily, the primary
methods to access information on the Internet do not permit
individual or non-commercial content providers to control who on
the Internet can access their content.  From the perspective of
the content provider, information that is publicly available on
the Internet is available to all users of the Internet, even
users who might be minors.  
          100.  None of the major methods of accessing
information -- including electronic mail, listservs, newsgroups,
chat lines, telnet, ftp, gopher, and the World Wide Web -- has
the ability to track the millions of individuals who access the
Internet and screen out those who are under eighteen years of
age.  Although password-required access to content is possible
(and is used in some circumstances), a password-access system
would effectively remove from public access an enormous volume of
valuable content on the Internet, and would reduce the
information available to adults on the Internet to only content
deemed suitable for minors.
          101.  The vast majority of content providers on the
Internet are individuals who post messages to newsgroups and
listservs, and who create content on the World Wide Web.  Those
individual content providers could not possibly create and
maintain a database of specific Internet users who request access
to the content and who prove they are 18 or older.  Nor could
individuals or other non-commercial content providers practically
administer or economically afford an instantaneous credit card
verification system.  Such a requirement would effectively
preclude any communications by those content providers that could
be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors.
          102.  Even larger organizations that provide content on
the Internet cannot practically or economically track the
millions of Internet users to determine whether those users are
minors or adults.  
          103.  Moreover, even if pre-registration by content
users were practically or economically possible, the value of the
content would be dramatically diminished because so few content
users would anticipate the need to pre-register for a particular
site.  A huge percentage of Internet traffic is by users engaged
in spontaneous and unpredictable research or searches for
content, and a pre-registration requirement would effectively end
this type of search. 
          104.  As described above, the World Wide Web is a
spontaneous and serendipitous communications medium, in which a
user can jump from site to site to site depending on what content
looks most useful or interesting, without any pre-registration or
advance request.  Requiring pre-registration for all sites that
might contain content arguably covered by the Act (if such pre-
registration were practically possible) would drastically reduce
the usefulness of the World Wide Web.
          105.  For other methods of providing content on the
Internet, it is flatly impossible for a content provider to
control who can access the content.  With USENET newsgroups, for
example, once a content provider posts a message to a newsgroup,
that message is automatically distributed to over 190,000
computers around the world, and the individual content provider
has no ability whatsoever to control who is permitted to access
the content on those 190,000 computers.  Under the Act, all
content posted to USENET newsgroups must be reduced to a level
appropriate for young children.  Similarly, Internet mailing list
services such as "listserv" also do not allow the speaker to
control who receives the communication, and thus speech via a
mailing list service would also be reduced to the level
appropriate for young children.

Ineffectiveness of the Act and Effectiveness of Alternative Means

          106.  The overwhelming majority of content on the
Internet is non-sexual in nature, and is not even arguably
"indecent" or "patently offensive," even for minors.  However, a
significant amount of the content on the Internet could arguably
be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors in some
communities, and the Act bans or burdens all of that content.
          107.  Although imposing extreme burdens on the
Internet, the Act will in fact have very little impact on the
availability to persons under 18 of "indecent" or "patently
offensive" images or communications on the Internet.  At least in
part because Congress held no hearings on the Act, did not
collect information about how the Internet works, and only
haphazardly reviewed the content on the Internet, the Act does
not accomplish or even significantly further the ostensible goal
of limiting access by persons under 18 to "indecent" or "patently
offensive" images.  There are at least two reasons why
implementation of the Act will be highly ineffective as a
limitation on such access.
          108.  First, a high percentage of sexual content on the
Internet originates outside of the United States, and it is not
possible to prevent that content from being "available" in the
United States.  To the extent the Act imposes any burdens on
domestic commercial providers of such communications, those
providers will have the option of moving their operations
overseas.
          109.  Second, the existence of "anonymous remailers"
means that any content -- indecent or otherwise -- can be placed
onto the Internet anonymously, and the government would be unable
to identify the content provider.  Anonymous remailer systems --
which often are located overseas -- will automatically receive a
communication and forward it to a destination after having
removed all trace of the origin of the communication.
          110.  At bottom, therefore, the Act does little to
limit the ability of commercial or non-commercial entities to
provide "indecent" or "patently offensive" images on the
Internet.
          111.  A critical difference between the Act's attempt
to regulate indecency on the Internet and prior governmental
attempts to regulate indecency (over radio, television, and
telephone sex lines, for example) is that there are tens of
millions of speakers on the Internet, with no bottleneck through
which all of the speech must pass.
          112.  There are alternative means that are far more
effective in limiting a minor's access to "indecent" or "patently
offensive" communications.  The only place where it is
practically possible to screen out commercial indecency, non-
commercial indecency, domestic indecency, overseas indecency,
intentional indecency, inadvertent indecency, and anonymous
indecency is in the computer that is attempting to receive the
speech.
          113.  The government's legitimate interest in aiding
parental control over the Internet material their children access
may be served by several means that are both less restrictive and
more effective than a blanket ban on "indecent" or "patently
offensive" communications.  Parents have control over their
children's access to communications through interactive computer
services.  For example, parents can deny their child access to
the computer; parents can supervise their child's use of
interactive computer services; parents can decline to subscribe
to interactive computer services until their child is older;
parents can take advantage of the free screening and blocking
options available at no extra charge from commercial online
services; and parents can obtain software (some of it free, and
most of it for a very modest cost) for their home computers to
screen material they find objectionable.
          114.  Commercial online services such as America
Online, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, and Prodigy offer
technologies that allow parents to block their children's access
to certain online forums and areas where children might be
exposed to inappropriate content.  These online services, for
example, include a feature that allows parents to prevent their
children from accessing interactive discussion forums (chat
rooms).  They also offer parents the ability to block access to
all or portions of the Internet, including the World Wide Web and
USENET newsgroups, based on keywords, subject matter, or specific
newsgroups.  These tools can be configured to block access to
groups based on any keyword.
          115.  In addition, a variety of software providers have
developed applications to use in conjunction with commercial
online services, over and above the parental control features
provided by commercial services, while others are designed
specifically for direct access.  SurfWatch, for example, allows
parents to block their child's access to USENET newsgroups, World
Wide Web, gopher, and ftp sites with sexually explicit content. 
When activated with a private password held only by a parent,
SurfWatch completely prevents any user from accessing these
areas.  The service automatically updates the list of blocked
sites, without any intervention required from the user.  NET
NANNY, another example, contains a dictionary in which the parent
can enter the names of sites that contain sexually explicit or
other material.  Parents may also enter phrases which if
transmitted or received will automatically disconnect the
network.  Among other things, the program also keeps a log of all
activity that occurs on the computer, allowing parents to monitor
their children's use of the computer.
          116.  Products such as the Netscape Proxy Server and
WEBTrack provide schools and businesses the ability to block
specific sites from access by all users on the network, and to
track and monitor use of the Internet.
          117.  Because the Internet is a global network with
millions of users, speaker-based content restrictions cannot
effectively control the availability of materials inappropriate
for children.  The only effective way to protect children from
inappropriate material on the Internet is to encourage the
continued development and deployment of user-based tools that
empower parents to control their children's online activities
based on the parents' views of what is appropriate for their
children.  The products described here, and others like them,
provide parents these tools, and can do so without the need for
criminalizing or banning the distribution to adults of
constitutionally protected communications.

       Speech of the Plaintiffs and the Impact of the Act

          118.  The plaintiffs (and the plaintiffs' members,
subscribers, patrons, and customers) interact with and use the
Internet, and cyberspace generally, in a wide variety of ways,
and they are burdened by the Act in an equally wide variety of
ways.  Plaintiffs include content providers on the Internet,
access providers to the Internet, and users of the content on the
Internet.  The Act burdens plaintiffs in all of these capacities.
          119.  Plaintiffs who are content providers (or whose
members or customers are content providers) are expressly subject
to the Act.  Under the Act, anyone who speaks on the Internet is
a content provider.  These plaintiffs do not understand what
standard for indecency should be used under the Act, how the
standard applies to the plaintiffs' speech, or how numerous other
provisions of the Act are to be understood and applied.  These
plaintiffs provide content that would likely or possibly be found
to be indecent as to a young child in some communities. 
Accordingly, they are subject to prosecution under the Act. 
These plaintiffs will either self-censor their speech or will
continue to speak under the threat of prosecution.
          120.  Plaintiffs who are, or whose members are, access
providers (including "Internet service providers" or "ISPs") are
expressly subject to the Act.  As access providers these
plaintiffs enable their customers and users to use plaintiffs'
facilities to link to the Internet.  Although the Act provides
defenses for access providers, access providers reasonably fear
that these defenses will not be construed and applied as broadly
as Congress intended, and they therefore fear they may be
directly subject to prosecution under the Act.  These plaintiffs
will continue to provide access under the threat of prosecution.
          121.  All plaintiffs (and their members and customers)
are users of the Internet.  These plaintiffs and other users have
a right to engage in ordinary human discourse free from the
threat of prosecution created by the Act.  In particular, these
plaintiffs and other users have a right to receive content that
is criminalized under the Act.
          122.  Plaintiffs AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ("ALA")
and FREEDOM TO READ FOUNDATION ("FTRF") sue on behalf of
themselves, their members, who are libraries and librarians
across the country, and their members' patrons.  These libraries
recognize that the Internet offers their patrons a unique
opportunity to access information, and many libraries provide
their patrons with facilities the patrons can use to access the
Internet.  Many libraries also have their own World Wide Web
sites on the Internet.  Thus, in addition to providing patrons
with access to the Internet, where they can access information
posted by third parties, libraries post their own material on the
Internet.  Many libraries post their card catalogues, post
information about current events, sponsor chat groups, post
textual information or art on the library Web site, or post
licensed online versions of reference and other materials from
their library collections.  Patrons could, for example, access
the Web site of a library anywhere in the country to peruse its
card catalogue, review an encyclopedia reference, or check a
definition in the dictionary.  These libraries and librarians are
injured by the Act.  Because of fear of prosecution, they will be
chilled from posting materials on the Internet that might be
deemed "patently offensive" or "indecent" for minors by some
communities.  Given the global and unrestricted nature of the
Internet, the lack of precision in the definition of "indecency,"
and the past attempts by some persons to ban literature and
reference items from library collections, many of ALA's and
FTRF's members may choose not to post a substantial amount of
expressive material at all -- material that many adults might
consider useful for themselves or their own children -- rather
than risk prosecution for posting material that someone in some
other part of the nation might deem "indecent" or "patently
offensive" for minors.  As a result of the Act, the library
patrons ALA and FTRF members serve will be limited in the
constitutionally protected information that would otherwise be
available to them on the Internet.  These plaintiffs (and their
members) sue in their capacity as content providers, access
providers, and users of the Internet, and on behalf of their
patrons who are content providers and users of interactive
computer services.
          123.  Plaintiffs AOL, COMPUSERVE, MSN, and PRODIGY sue
on their own behalf and on behalf of their subscribers.  As
online service providers, these plaintiffs are content providers
and access providers, and their customers are content providers
and users of the Internet.  These plaintiffs create content and
make it available both to their customers and to the entire world
of Internet users.  They also allow their customers to create
content on the Internet (including the creation of personal Web
pages).  As speakers, these plaintiffs and their customers are
chilled by the Act in what they can say on the Internet and on
their own online services.  As access providers, these plaintiffs
fear they may be at risk of prosecution under the Act for what
others say.  And as users, these plaintiffs and their customers
are limited by the Act to the ability to access only content that
is suitable for a young child.
          124.  Plaintiff MICROSOFT CORPORATION ("Microsoft")
sues on its own behalf as a content provider, access software
provider, and user of the Internet.  Microsoft provides content
on the Internet through MSN, on its own Web sites, and through
postings, messages, and other contributions to the Internet. 
Microsoft's diverse content includes compilations of musical,
artistic, literary and encyclopedic information, news and current
events, and other content.  Some of this content might be
considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" in some community
in the nation, exposing Microsoft to the risk of prosecution
under the Act.  As an access software provider, Microsoft sells
or plans to sell software for accessing and exploring the
Internet, for establishing and maintaining Internet servers and
related services, and for creating Web sites and other Internet
content.  As users, Microsoft and its employees are chilled in
what they can say and the frankness of their discussion in
communications posted to or transmitted over the Internet, and
are exposed to a risk of prosecution under the Act.  Microsoft
believes that the defenses provided in Section 502(2) of the Act
are provided only to access providers, not to content providers
and/or users, and that as to access providers, including access
software providers, they are inadequate, incomplete, and expose
Microsoft to potential prosecution under the Act.  In addition,
the chilling effect of the Act on other content providers and
users of the Internet will damage Microsoft by reducing the
market for access software, services software, and content-
creation software.
          125.  Plaintiff APPLE COMPUTER, INC. ("Apple") sues on
its own behalf as a content provider, access software provider
and user of the Internet.  Apple provides content on the Internet
through eWorld, on its own Web sites, and through postings,
messages and other contributions to the Internet.  Because of the
vagueness of the Act, Apple is uncertain whether some of this
content might be considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" in
some community in the nation, exposing Apple to the risk of
prosecution under the Act.  As users, Apple and its employees are
chilled in what they can say and the frankness of their
discussion in communications posted to or transmitted over the
Internet, and are exposed to a risk of prosecution under the Act. 
In addition, the chilling effect of the Act on other content
providers and users of the Internet will damage Apple by reducing
the market for Internet software.
          126.  Plaintiff COMMERCIAL INTERNET EXCHANGE
ASSOCIATION ("CIX") sues on behalf of its member Internet service
providers ("ISPs") and the customers of their members.  CIX
members typically serve as passive carriers who offer access or
transmission, and related incidental capabilities, for the
Internet transmissions of others; as such they are clearly
covered by the defense of  223(e)(1).  However, because of
ambiguity in this defense, CIX members who operate news servers
that carry USENET content are uncertain whether they may be held
liable for the content of others that resides temporarily on
members' USENET news servers, and is accessed by users from such
servers.  In addition, many CIX members also assist content
providers in establishing and operating Web sites.  In this
capacity CIX members will often be at risk of prosecution under
the Act for what others say.  Due to fear of prosecution, CIX
members are chilled from assisting providers of valuable content
that may be deemed indecent.  Furthermore, CIX members have a
strong interest in the continued growth of the Internet as a
means of communication, and in their subscribers' rights to free
expression over the Internet.  The Act undermines both interests.
          127.  Plaintiff NETCOM ON-LINE COMMUNICATION SERVICES,
INC. ("NETCOM") sues on its own behalf and on behalf of its
subscribers.  As a provider of Internet access and services,
NETCOM is both a content provider and an access provider. 
NETCOM's individual subscribers create content on the Internet,
such as through the posting of personal web pages, and make that
content available both to their own customers and to the entire
world of Internet users.  As speakers, NETCOM and its subscribers
are chilled in what they can say on the Internet and on their own
Internet sites.  As an access provider, NETCOM cannot control
what others say, yet faces the risk of prosecution under the Act
for the speech of others made available through its systems.  As
users of the Internet, NETCOM and its subscribers are limited by
the Act to accessing and producing only content that is suitable
for a young child.
          128.  Plaintiff OPNET, INC. ("OpNet") sues on its own
behalf and on behalf of its subscribers.  As a provider of
Internet access and services to subscribers, OpNet faces
uncertainty as to the applicability of the Act's defenses.  OpNet
also fears that it will be construed to have liability for
content posted by third parties through its systems.
          129.  Plaintiff INTERACTIVE SERVICES ASSOCIATION
("ISA") sues on behalf of its members, who include the major
commercial online services, and other content providers, access
providers, and users of the Internet.  As with the online
services, ISA's members risk prosecution for engaging in, or
serving as a conduit for, constitutionally protected speech that
might be deemed indecent.  Accordingly, the Act will chill ISA
members from exercising their First Amendment rights.
          130.  Plaintiff ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN PUBLISHERS
("AAP") sues on behalf of its members, who are content providers
on, and users of, the Internet.  Although rooted in print
publishing, AAP's members are very actively involved in the
Internet.  AAP's members create electronic products to accompany
and supplement their printed books and journals; create custom
educational material on the Internet, publishing on and to
demand; communicate with authors and others, receiving
manuscripts, and editing, typesetting, and designing books
electronically; transmit finished product to licensed end-user
customers; communicate with bookstores and other wholesale and
retail accounts; and promote authors and titles online.  Many of
AAP's members have Web sites and provide content to the world on
the Internet.  Some of the content provided by AAP's members
might be considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors
in some communities (as most of the efforts to ban books in
communities have been directed at books published by AAP's
members).
          131.  Plaintiff AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEWSPAPER EDITORS
("ASNE") sues on behalf of its members, who are editors of daily
newspapers throughout the United States that, in addition to
publications in print form, are now or soon will be published in
electronic formats available to the public on the Internet or
through online service providers.  Historically, the First
Amendment guarantee of "freedom of the press" has protected
newspapers from government-imposed content restrictions which,
like those in the Act, prohibit and punish the dissemination of
materials considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" with
respect to non-adult readers.  By its terms, however, the Act can
be applied to the press in the same manner that it can be applied
to any other person.  ASNE members, who make the editorial
decisions regarding what content will be published in the daily
editions of their newspapers, are concerned that the Act will
require them to censor the online version of their print editions
according to these vague and overbroad statutory standards,
thereby restricting the content of the "electronic" edition of
the daily newspaper in ways that the First Amendment does not
tolerate with respect to the traditional hard-copy print edition. 
For this reason, ASNE believes the Act imposes an unprecedented
but very real threat of unconstitutional press censorship which
could throttle the Internet's potential to greatly enhance the
diversity, availability, timeliness, quality, and utility of
daily newspapers by creating a powerful disincentive for
publication through the use of interactive media technologies.  
          132.  Plaintiff NEWSPAPER ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA
("NAA") files this lawsuit on behalf of its members, a majority
of which are daily newspapers in the United States.  Approxi-
mately 175 daily newspapers in North America are currently
available on the Internet, via commercial online services or
through local bulletin board services.  As content providers,
newspapers have utilized the Internet to provide electronic
versions of their printed product.  In fact, many newspapers
provide archives of their print product online.  As access
providers, newspapers have established electronic forums for
local communities to communicate and to conduct business.  While
the content in newspapers is considered neither indecent nor
patently offensive when published on newsprint, it now may be
when published electronically.  The dual standard imposed by the
Act will force newspapers to edit out content from publications
offered on the Internet -- content that is constitutionally
protected and not subject to challenge in printed form.  In many
cases, newspaper publishers will be forced to edit content
contained in the archived electronic version of the newspaper
already placed on the Internet long before the Act went into
effect.  Thus, the Act will seriously infringe upon the rights of
NAA members to publish constitutionally protected news and
information.
          133.  Plaintiff ASSOCIATION OF PUBLISHERS, EDITORS AND
WRITERS ("APEW") sues on behalf of its members, who write and
publish in print and online.  Members of APEW include the San
Francisco Guardian, the largest and oldest independently owned
alternative newsweekly in the United States; the Internet Press
Guild, an unincorporated association of writers, authors and
journalists who publish their works online; the California First
Amendment Coalition, a nonprofit, public interest corporation
whose membership comprises approximately 700 individuals and
organizations, including most of California's daily newspapers,
many weekly and student newspapers, broadcasters, law firms and
others; and individual writers and editors including Jim Warren,
a columnist and advocate for open government, and owner and
editor of the listserv GovAccess; Professor David Farber of the
University of Pennsylvania; John Quarterman, a columnist and
Secretary of Matrix Information and Directory Services, Inc.; T.
Bruce Tober, a freelance writer who researches and writes about
the Internet for a variety of print and online publications;
Stephanie Stefanac, Editor of MacWorld Online, a monthly trade
publication for users of the Macintosh computer manufactured by
Apple Computer Co.; and Rogier van Bakel, a Contributing Editor
to Wired Magazine.  The members of APEW face criminal
prosecutions under the Act for the online publication of works
which some communities might find "indecent" or "patently
offensive."  The vagueness of the Act leaves APEW members
uncertain whether the publication of their works over the
Internet would be a crime.
          134.  Plaintiff SOCIETY OF PROFESSIONAL JOURNALISTS
sues on its own behalf and on behalf of its members.  The
Society's membership produces a tremendous volume of content made
available over the Internet:  news stories, special interest
articles, columns, and opinion pieces, among many others.  Each
year brings a dramatic increase in the importance of electronic
media as a venue for distributing the news and opinion pieces
produced by professional journalists.  The members of the Society
fear that their right and ability, traditionally protected by the
First Amendment, to engage in an unfettered marketplace of ideas
and expression will be severely compromised by the Communications
Decency Act.  In addition, the Society operates a listserve
called "SPJ-L," a forum among more than 1,000 Internet users
(both Society members and non-members) from roughly 25 countries
to discuss and debate primarily journalism-related issues. 
Though, or perhaps because, it typically addresses topics of the
utmost seriousness and importance for journalists, the language
used in messages posted on SPJ-L can be offensive, harsh, and
vulgar.  The Society does not edit these messages for content. 
By continuing to provide this forum for discussion and debate,
the Society risks prosecution under the Act.  Its members, whose
writings and other speech would be protected by the First
Amendment in the context of other media, will be chilled by the
Act from engaging in constitutionally protected speech over the
Internet.
          135.  Plaintiff HOTWIRED VENTURES LLC ("HotWired
Ventures") sues on its own behalf and on behalf of its
subscribers.  HotWired Ventures operates an online magazine named
Hotwired.  Some of HotWired's editorial content might be
considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors in some
communities.  HotWired features articles containing facts about
and opinions on popular culture.  These articles sometimes
contain vulgar language and references to, inter alia, sexual
acts and sexual organs.  One area of HotWired's editorial focus
is cyberspace-related issues, including governmental attempts to
censor and regulate the Internet.  These articles sometimes
employ vulgar language in expressing opinions about this topic,
and may contain references to, and discussions of, examples of
material that might be deemed "patently offensive" or "indecent"
under the Act.  In addition, HotWired operates a regular section
called Piazza, an interactive discussion area where members can
communicate with each other both through asynchronous postings
called "threads" and in real time "chat rooms," sharing opinions
and engaging in outspoken discourse which can involve vulgar
language and may involve sexually explicit subject matter.  
Plaintiff WIRED VENTURES, LTD. ("Wired Ventures") sues on its own
behalf and on behalf of its subscribers.  Wired Ventures
publishes Wired Magazine, a print publication.  Like HotWired,
Wired publishes articles and short fiction that sometimes contain
vulgar language and references to sexual acts or sexual organs. 
Many articles published in Wired are also published online by
HotWired.  Thus, some articles that are perfectly legal for
minors or adults in print form are nevertheless banned from the
Internet.  The Act creates the anomalous situation that a
publication that is a leading commentator on issues and events
online may not under the Act be able to publish online articles
about the Internet that can be published in print.  HotWired
Ventures and Wired Ventures believe that the Act would severely
infringe their right to publish constitutionally protected
material and their readers' right to choose to read such
material.
          136.  Plaintiff AMERICAN BOOKSELLERS ASSOCIATION
("ABA") sues on behalf of its member bookstores (as content
providers and users) and their patrons (as users of the
Internet).  Although ABA's members are not "adult bookstores,"
many of ABA's members sell materials that deal frankly with the
subject of human sexuality.  Some member bookstores have their
own Web pages that discuss the content of books the stores sell. 
Most member bookstores use the Internet and electronic
communications to obtain information and excerpts of books from
publishers.  ABA members' right to learn about, acquire, and
distribute constitutionally protected materials, and their
patrons' right to purchase such constitutionally protected
materials, will be seriously infringed by the Act.
          137.  Plaintiff FAMILIES AGAINST INTERNET CENSORSHIP
("FAIC") is a national organization of parents dedicated to the
proposition that they, not the government, should decide what
their children should be able see or receive.  FAIC sues on
behalf of its members.  As parents, FAIC's members are deprived
of the opportunity to raise their children as they see fit.  As
users of the Internet, the Act violates FAIC's members' rights to
receive material suitable for adults.
          138.  Plaintiff CITIZENS INTERNET EMPOWERMENT COALITION
("CIEC") sues on behalf of its members as content providers,
access providers, and users of the Internet.  In particular, CIEC
and its members are injured because the Act deprives parents of
the ability to determine the content their children, including
older teenagers, should have access to on the Internet.
          139.  Notwithstanding the defenses set forth in the
Act, and the fact that Congress expressly directed courts to
construe those defenses broadly, plaintiffs reasonably fear
prosecution under 47 U.S.C.  223(d)(1)(B), as enacted by Section
502(2), for knowingly permitting their services or computers to
be used to display indecent material in a manner available to
persons under age 18, or to transmit such material to specific
persons under age 18.  Unless and until the defendants or the
Courts make clear that these defenses must be broadly construed,
there is nothing to prevent an aggressive prosecutor, in a
particularly intolerant community, from bringing a prosecution
and urging that the defenses be construed more narrowly than
plaintiffs believe Congress intended.
          140.  For these reasons, plaintiffs reasonably fear
that the defense in 47 U.S.C.  223(e)(1) may not protect online
service providers from criminal conviction for indecent
expression by third parties when that expression is located on
the providers' computers (such as when an individual computer
user posts a vulgar message to an online discussion).  Plaintiffs
reasonably fear that the defense may apply only to the extent an
online service acts as a mere conduit to enable its subscribers
to gain access to another network.
          141.  The speech at issue in this case is fully
protected by the First Amendment.  "Indecent" speech or "patently
offensive" communications, while considered by some to be
offensive or sexually suggestive, are not obscene.  Such speech
can have serious literary, artistic, political or other merit,
and thus has considerable value to adults and to society as a
whole.
          142.  The Internet, and cyberspace generally, carries a
significant amount of communications, images and text that might
be deemed inappropriate, "indecent" or "patently offensive" for
younger children (for example, in elementary school), but which
would not, under the same community standards, be deemed
inappropriate, "indecent" or "patently offensive" for older
minors (for example, in high school or early college).  The Act
makes no distinction between these age groups, and would
criminalize a university professor's distribution -- using the
university's interactive computer service -- of "indecent" but
classic works of literature to a 17-year-old freshman.
          143.  Dissemination of many of the same communications
whose dissemination via interactive computer services is made
criminal by the Act would not be unlawful if disseminated by
traditional print media (e.g., newspaper or magazine) or by using
the United States mail.  Thus, many of the very same
communications the Act makes it unlawful to make available to
minors through interactive computer services can lawfully be made
available through other media, and are, in fact, so available.
          144.  Any government regulation of "indecent" or
"patently offensive" speech may withstand constitutional scrutiny
only if it both serves a "compelling interest" and is "the least
restrictive means" to advance that interest, and only if the
benefit gained from the Act outweighs the loss of
constitutionally protected rights.
          145.  The government has no legitimate, much less
"compelling," interest in preventing adults from sending or
receiving "indecent" or "patently offensive" speech.  The
government has no legitimate, much less "compelling," interest in
preventing older children from sending or receiving speech that
would only be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" if
communicated to younger children.
          146. One legitimate interest the government does have
-- and the only interest articulated in the Act ( 509, to be
codified at 47 U.S.C.  230) -- is to assist parents in
supervising their children's access to expressive materials.  The
Act does not, however, further that interest.  Indeed, the Act
interferes with that interest because parents who decide their
children, whether 7 or 17, should have access to some materials
that some community might deem "indecent" or "patently offensive"
for those children are prevented from exercising their parental
judgment by the Act's blanket prohibition on all access by all
persons under 18 to all such materials.
          147.  Even if the government had a legitimate interest,
more broadly, in preventing interactive computer service access
by all persons under 18 to communications that some community
might deem "indecent" or "patently offensive" to them, the Act
would not materially further that interest.  Among other things,
communications of foreign origin are freely accessible on the
Internet, and the United States government has no means to
prosecute foreign content-providers for violation of the Act, or
to deter such postings.  Furthermore, existing statutes and other
provisions in the Act already prohibit the use of computers to
disseminate obscenity, child pornography, harassing speech,
enticing or luring minors into inappropriate activities, and
other speech that is not protected even for adults.
          148.  Even if the Act could be viewed as substantially
furthering a compelling governmental interest in protecting
minors from "indecent" or "patently offensive" communications, it
is not the least restrictive means of achieving that interest. 
The screening and blocking tools described above achieve that
interest far more effectively than does the Act itself, and with
no adverse impact on the constitutional rights of adults. 
Efforts by government to spur the further development of such
tools would further the claimed governmental interest more
directly and materially than does the Act.
          149.  Even if the Act could be viewed as the least
restrictive means to further a compelling governmental interest
in protecting minors from "indecent" or "patently offensive"
communications, any benefit gained from the Act would be far
outweighed by the loss of constitutionally protected rights of
adults, because only some applications of the Act will in fact
protect minors, but every application of the Act will punish or
deter speech that is constitutionally protected for adults.

                        CAUSES OF ACTION

                             COUNT 1
          150.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
          151.  With respect to constitutionally protected
communications which might be deemed "indecent" or "patently
offensive" for persons under 18, the Act, in plain terms and
practical effect, bans a substantial amount of speech by and to
adults, including speech by and to plaintiffs, their members, and
their subscribers, patrons and customers, in violation of the
First Amendment of the United States Constitution.
                             COUNT 2
          152.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
          153.  With respect to constitutionally protected
communications which might be deemed "indecent" or "patently
offensive" for persons under 18, the Act, in plain terms and
practical effect, unduly burdens and deters a substantial amount
of speech by and to adults, including speech by and to
plaintiffs, their members, and their subscribers, patrons, and
customers, in violation of the First Amendment of the United
States Constitution.
                             COUNT 3
          154.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
          155.  Sections 502(1) and 502(2) of the Act unduly
chill and compel self-censorship of constitutionally protected
speech of plaintiffs, their members, and their subscribers,
patrons, and customers, in violation of the First Amendment of
the United States Constitution.
                             COUNT 4
          156.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
          157.  Section 502(2) of the Act, 47 U.S.C.  223(d), is
fatally overbroad.  In particular, it bans, burdens, and
criminalizes speech that is constitutionally protected for
adults, and for older minors, restricting both adults and 17
year-olds to communications appropriate for 7 year olds.  And it
bans, burdens, and criminalizes a much broader range of
constitutionally protected expression than is constitutionally
permissible.  Accordingly, the provision violates the First
Amendment.
                             COUNT 5
          158.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
          159.  Any blocking system to be imposed by the content
provider/speaker would require advance identification of those
seeking access to a particular Web site, chat room, discussion
group, or other online forum that might potentially contain
communications that could be deemed "indecent" or "patently
offensive" to persons under 18.  See 47 U.S.C.   223(e)(5)(B). 
A requirement of advance identification would make it impossible
for users to engage in constitutionally protected anonymous
speech on matters of public and private importance.  For many
users, such anonymity is critical to their participation in the
speech.
          160.  For such users, the Act will require them to
choose between anonymity and losing access to such
communications.  As a result, in many cases, their First
Amendment rights to read and view constitutionally protected text
and images will be infringed.
          161.  Section 502(2) accordingly violates the First
Amendment.
                             COUNT 6
          162.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
          163.  Plaintiffs are unable to determine with
reasonable certainty which constitutionally protected expression
Congress sought to proscribe in  223(a)(1)(B) and (d).  In
particular, the terms "indecent" and "patently offensive as
measured by contemporary community standards" are entirely
subjective; as a matter of law depend on the context in which the
communications arise; are undefined and undefinable in the
cyberspace context; have entirely different meanings depending
upon the age of the recipient even though the Act treats all
minors of all ages the same; and give no indication as to which
community governs the inquiry.  In these, and other ways, the Act
does not put reasonable persons on notice of what communications
are prohibited.  As a consequence, plaintiffs, their members, and
subscribers, patrons, and customers are forced to guess at which
speech on interactive computer services may give rise to criminal
prosecution.
          164.  The vagueness of the terms "indecent" and
"patently offensive as measured by contemporary community
standards," and of other provisions of the Act, and the draconian
penalties for a wrong guess, will force plaintiffs, their
members, and their subscribers, patrons, and customers, and
substantial numbers of other providers of content to the
Internet, to self-censor far more speech than would in fact be
prohibited in order to comply with their understanding of the
Act's requirements, or to avoid potential criminal prosecution,
and will thus chill constitutionally protected expression.
          165.  The vagueness of the terms "indecent" and
"patently offensive as measured by contemporary community
standards," and of other provisions of the Act, invites arbitrary
enforcement.
          166.  The Act is, accordingly, so vague as to violate
the First and Fifth Amendments.
                             COUNT 7
          167.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
          168.  Plaintiffs reasonably fear that the defenses
under the Act will not be construed as broadly as Congress
intended, and will therefore subject their dissemination or
facilitation of constitutionally protected speech to criminal
prosecution and conviction in several significant contexts.
          169.   The "good faith defense," which is the only
defense even arguably available to non-commercial content-
providers, gives insufficient guidance to content-providers as to
whether their dissemination of constitutionally protected speech
is prohibited.  Plaintiff content-providers have no means of
ascertaining whether a jury will determine that they have taken
"reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions under the
circumstances" to restrict minors' access to material that is
"indecent" or "patently offensive as measured by contemporary
community standards."  Act 502(2), to be codified at 47 U.S.C.
 223(e)(5)(A).
          170.  Similarly, service providers who host Web sites
or other online sites, without controlling content, but on whose
facilities others' communications reside, reasonably fear an
aggressive prosecutor will argue, contrary to plaintiffs'
understanding of Congressional intent, that such actions will
constitute a "display" of such communications under
 223(d)(1)(B), and that such services are not protected by the
"access provider" defense, even though the service providers'
role clearly "does not include the creation of the content of the
communication."   223(e)(1).
          171.  For similar reasons, plaintiffs cannot with
reasonable certainty rely on the access provider defense,
 223(e)(1), to exempt access providers' operation of USENET news
servers that automatically store content posted by users, which
remains on their servers for a number of days and is available to
subscribers.
          172.  For similar reasons, plaintiffs cannot with
reasonable certainty determine whether the defense,  223(e)(1),
applies to ISPs who assist content providers in establishing or
operating Web pages or other online sites, and who, although
having no control of content, might be deemed to be a
"conspirator" under  223(e)(2) if they knowingly arrange for
access to valuable, constitutionally protected material that may
be deemed "indecent."
          173.  As a consequence, plaintiffs, their members, and
their subscribers, patrons, and customers, are forced to guess at
whether their activities may give rise to criminal prosecution.
          174.  The uncertainty of how prosecutors or the courts
will construe the defenses, the fact that they are only defenses,
which must be raised and proved after a defendant has already
been subjected to the humiliation, stigma, and expense of a
criminal prosecution, and the draconian penalties for a wrong
guess, will force plaintiffs, their members, and their
subscribers, patrons, and customers, and a substantial number of
other providers of content to the Internet, to self-censor speech
protected by the First Amendment in order to comply with their
understanding of the Act's requirements, or to avoid potential
criminal prosecution, and will thus chill constitutionally
protected expression.
          175.  The vagueness of these provisions invites
arbitrary enforcement.
          176.  Sections 502(1) and (2), accordingly, are so
vague as to violate the First and Fifth Amendments.
                             COUNT 8
          177.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
          178.  Sections 502(1) and (2) of the Act violate the
First Amendment rights of plaintiffs, their members, and their
subscribers, patrons, and customers, insofar as they single out
for special bans or burdens speakers engaged in one class of
constitutionally protected speech by one specific medium, and do
not similarly ban or burden speakers engaged in other classes of
speech, or in the same speech via other mediums, without
sufficient justification.
     WHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court:
          A.  Declare that Sections 502(1) and (2) of the
Communications Decency Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C.  223(a)(1)(B),
223(a)(2), and 223(d), are unconstitutional; 
          B.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin defendants
from enforcing those provisions.
          C.  Award plaintiffs such costs and fees as are allowed
by law; and 
          D.  Grant plaintiffs such other and further relief as
the Court deems just and proper.

                                   
                                   Respectfully submitted,

(1) CITIZENS INTERNET EMPOWERMENT COALITION REQUEST FOR INJUNCTION OF CDA

The Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition Friday (3/1) filed a motion for
a preliminary injunction of the Communications Decency Act.  The filing
sets the stage for an historic court battle which will determine the future
of the Internet as a viable means for free expression, education, and
commerce, as well as the fate of the First Amendment in the information
age.  Witnesses will begin to testify before the Philadelphia Federal court
beginning March 21, 1996.

The Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition (CIEC) is coordinated by the
Center for Democracy and Technology, America Online, the American Library
Association, and others, including People for the American Way.  Its 37
members include over 5000 individual Internet users, libraries, book
publishers, newspaper publishers, editors, advertisers, commercial online
service providers, ISP's, non-profit groups, and civil liberties advocates.

Individual Internet users are encouraged to join the fight! All users of
the Internet are potentially subject to massive fines and prison sentences
under the Communications Decency Act.  Join the CIEC and become a part of a
landmark case which will determine the future of  free speech online.

Over 5000 individuals have joined as of 5:30 pm Friday 3/1! For more
information, on what you can do to help overturn the CDA,  please visit the
CIEC web page at:

http://www.cdt.org/ciec/

You must join by March 15, so please hurry!

The text of the CIEC complaint and other relevant information is currently
available on the CIEC web page. Copies of today's motion, along with the
declarations listed below, will be available on the CIEC page shortly.

THE INTERNET IS A UNIQUE COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY WHICH DESERVES FULL
FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS

In the motion filed today, CIEC argues that the Internet is a unique
communications technology distinct from traditional broadcast mass media
and telephone networks, and that the broad content regulations imposed by
the CDA are unconstitutionally restrictive.  The CIEC argues that because
the Internet offers users tremendous control over the content they receive,
it deserves first amendment protections at least as broad as those enjoyed
by the print medium.  Specifically, the motion states:

  &quot;The Internet, and 'cyberspace' generally, is an entirely new
   communications medium that differs from other media in crucial
   respects: it is global, it is decentralized, it gives ordinary
   citizens unparalleled ability to communicate to and with others on a
   scale never before possible, an it is unobtrusive, because users
   access only the communications they affirmatively request. It
   therefor merits the highest level of First Amendment protection.&quot;
   (Page 2)

The motion goes on to argue:

  &quot;In sum, this Court should accord to the interactive computer medium
  the most vigilant protection from government censorship and
  overreaching.  The unparalleled potential of cyberspace to effectuate
  the core policies of the First Amendment calls for a reaffirmance of
  our 'profound national commitment' to public discourse that is
  'uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.&quot;

  &quot;The challenged provisions of the Act, however, represent an
  indiscriminate and damaging retreat from that commitment, one that
  reflects an as-yet poor legislative understanding even of the basic
  operating methods  of cyberpsace.  Those provisions are facially
  invalid because they abridge far too much protected speech while
  affording little incremental protection for minors, and threaten to
  disrupt the rapidly unfolding development of a salutary communications
  revolution that until now has flourished with a minimum of
  governmental interference.&quot; (Pages 60 - 61).


OVER 39 DECLARATIONS DESCRIBE THE INTERNET AND THE IMPACT OF THE CDA.

Included in the CIEC filing today were declarations from individuals,
libraries, online service providers, content providers, publishers,
non-profit groups, civil liberties advocates, and even a US Senator.  The
declarations describe in detail the potential impact the CDA will have on
their rights to free speech on the Internet, and will be considered by the
court as evidence in the case.  The list of groups filing declarations
today includes:

(1) PRESIDENT CLINTON SIGNS CDA, WORLD WIDE WEB GOES BLACK

President Clinton signed the Telecommunications Reform Bill, CDA and all, into 
law this morning.  

In response, and in overwhelming numbers, people around the world are making 
their web pages black (with white text) to illustrate the far reaching effect 
of the new online 'indecency' restrictions included in the "Communications 
Decency Act".  Over 1500 sites have indicated their support for the protest, 
including:

* Sen. Patrick Leahy  - http://www.senate.gov/~leahy
* Rep. Jerrold Nadler - http://www.house.gov/nadler/welcome.html
* Yahoo               - http://www.yahoo.com/
* SurfWatch Software  - http://www.surfwatch.com/
* Netcom              - http://www.netcom.com/
* And many others. 

A complete listing is available at http://www.cdt.org/speech.html

The story about the protest, and the concerns of the entire Internet community 
over the new, sweeping restrictions on constitutional speech enacted today, 
are finally getting the attention they deserve in the National media. In 
addition, we've seen an amazing outpouring of support around the country and 
around the world for this effort, and hope you all feel a part of something 
larger than all of us put together.  We certainly do.  

CDT, along with other prominent public interest civil liberties organizations, 
individuals, community groups, and businesses which would be effected by the 
CDA, are preparing a law suit against the provisions to be filed in Federal 
Court very soon.  Details will be announced on this list and posted on CDT's 
web site as they become available.

48 HOUR PROTEST INFORMATION - DARKENING THE WEB

If you have joined the protest, please continue to keep your web page
backgrounds black until Saturday, noon. 

Thank you for participating in the Internet's most visible Internet 
demonstration ever. Together, we are demonstrating that the Internet.Community 
is a growing political force capable of making our concerns felt on a National 
scale. This truly is an historic moment.

-censorship issue (including the text of the final CDA, analysis, and other 
relevant materials) are available at CDT's net-censorship web page:

(1) BROAD COALITION CHALLENGES INTERNET CENSORSHIP BILL IN COURT

A coalition representing a broad spectrum of Internet users, publishers,
content providers and access providers filed a lawsuit today (2/26/96) in a
Federal Court in Philadelphia, PA seeking to overturn the recently enacted
Communications Decency Act. The challenge will argue that the Internet is a
unique communications technology which deserves First Amendment 
protections at least as broad as those enjoyed as by the print medium.

The group, known as the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition (CIEC -
pronounced "seek") is coordinated by the Center for Democracy and
Technology, America Online, and the American Library Association, and
others, including People for the American Way. Its 35 members include
libraries, book publishers, newspaper publishers, editors, advertisers,
commercial online service providers, ISP's, non-profit groups, and civil
liberties advocates.

Individual Internet users are also invited to join the CIEC in the fight to
protect free speech online (see instructions below).

In addition to CIEC, named plaintiffs in the challenge include the American
Library Association,  America Online, Compuserve, Prodigy, Microsoft,
NETCOM, The Commercial Internet eXchange,the Newspaper Association of 
America, the American Booksellers Association, HotWired and Wired
Magazine, and others (a complete list of plaintiffs and CIEC members is
printed below).

EDUCATING THE COURT ON THE NATURE OF THE INTERNET AND 
ALTERNATIVES TO CENSORSHIP

In a 55 page complaint that details the history of the Internet and
outlines how the network operates, the CIEC intends to educate the court
on how the Internet functions and why the broad content regulations 
imposed by the CDA threaten the very existence of the Internet as a 
viable medium for free expression, education, and commerce. Among other 
things, the CIEC challenge argues that:

* The Internet is a unique communications medium which deserves First
  Amendment protections at least as broad as those afforded to print
  media.

* Individual users and parents, not the Federal Government, should
  determine for themselves and their children what material
  comes into their homes based on their own tastes and values.

* The CDA will be ineffective at protecting children from "indecent" or
  "patently" offensive material online.

The full text of the CIEC complaint, along with other relevant background
information, and information on how you can participate in this landmark
case, can be found on the CIEC World Wide Web Page:

<a href = "http://www.cdt.org/ciec/">http://www.cdt.org/ciec/</a>

The CIEC challenge is separate from the case brought by the ACLU, EFF,
EPIC, Planned Parenthood, and several other plaintiffs in the same
Philadelphia court on February 8, 1996. The ACLU effort has made
significant and important headway in the past several weeks.  The CIEC case
will reinforce the ACLU's efforts while focusing on the unique nature of
the Internet and alternatives to government content regulations.  ACLU and
CIEC attorneys are closely coordinating their efforts, and it is expected
that the courts will eventually consolidate the two cases.

The outcome of the legal challenges to the CDA will likely determine the
legal status of speech on the Internet and the future of the First
Amendment in the Information Age.

INDIVIDUAL INTERNET USERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO JOIN THE FIGHT

CIEC is inviting individual Internet users to join this landmark case to
help protect freedom of speech and the future of the Internet as a viable
means of free expression, education, and commerce.

If you post messages to a public listserv, Usenet newsgroup, participate
in an IRC or chat session, or maintain your own World Wide Web page, ftp 
or gopher archive, you could potentially face $250,000 fines or 2 years in
jail if someone, somewhere considers the material you post to be "indecent"

(1) BIPARTISAN BILLS TO EASE ENCRYPTION CONTROLS AND PROTECT INTERNET PRIVACY
    INTRODUCED IN SENATE AND HOUSE

A bipartisan group of members from both houses of Congress today introduced
legislation to lift many export controls on strong encryption hardware and
software and affirm the rights of Americans to use whatever form of
cryptography they choose. The bills, sponsored by Sen. Leahy (D-VT), Sen.
Burns (R-MT), Rep. Goodlatte (R-VA), Rep. Eshoo (D-CA), and others,
represent a major step towards breaking the stranglehold on encryption
technologies which for years has denied computer users access to vital
privacy-protecting applications.

The "Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996" represents a rejection
of the Clinton Administration's invasive and unworkable "Clipper Chip" and
"Clipper II" key escrow policies. Under the guise of promoting so-called
"voluntary" encryption standards, these Administration efforts have sought
to use export controls to compel the adoption of key escrow encryption
domestically, and have left Internet users without adequate privacy and
security.

By relaxing export controls on "generally available" cryptographic
applications such as PGP, popular Web browsers, and other programs, the
Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996 would encourage the
development and use of strong privacy protecting technologies. Major
provisions of the legislation would:

* Ease export controls on encryption products, allowing the export of
  'mass market' or 'generally available' cryptography. This would
  include products such as PGP or many of the popular Web browser
  programs.

* Affirm the right of Americans to use any encryption domestically. The
  bills explicitly prohibit the government from imposing any limits
  on the domestic use or sale of encryption.

* (Senate version only) Provide protections to those who choose to store
  their encryption keys with third parties by creating criminal and
  civil  penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of keys and strict
  requirements for law enforcement access.  The bill does not in any way
  affect the ability of any person to use encryption without a key
  escrow function..

The legislation also contains several provisions which CDT believes require
further clarification and consideration, including controversial language
that would create a new federal crime for the use of encryption to
willfully obstruct a law enforcement investigation. CDT will work with
Senators Leahy and Burns and Representatives Goodlatte, Eshoo, and other
interested members to address these concerns as the bill makes its way
through the legislative process.

The full text of both the House and Senate versions of the bills, along
with other relevant background information, is available on CDT's Crypto
Issues World Wide Web page:

<a href="http://www.cdt.org/crypto/">http://www.cdt.org/crypto/</a>

CDT believes that the House and Senate encryption bills are an important
step forward in the ongoing attempts to build better security into the
information infrastructure through the widespread availability of
encryption. Congressional action is particularly welcome as the
Administration has continued to impose a flawed approach to encryption
based upon export controls, key length limits, and key escrow policies all
aimed at slowing the adoption of strong cryptography in the U.S. and
throughout the world.

While CDT believes improvements can be made in both bills, they establish a
solid framework for building a comprehensive, global cryptography policy.
CDT believes the bills deserve careful consideration and support. We look
forward to working with Senator Leahy, Senator Burns, Rep. Goodlatte, Rep.
Eshoo, individual Internet users, public interest advocates, and the
computer and communications industry to develop a cryptography policy that
protects privacy, security, and competitiveness on the Global Information
Infrastructure.

SUMMARY OF THE LEGISLATION: WHAT THE BILLS WOULD DO

The House and Senate bills both modify Title 18 of the U.S. Code to clarify
the status of encrypted communications, access to those communications by
law enforcement, and the liability of third-party key holders.  The bills
would:

* SIGNIFICANTLY EASE EXPORT CONTROLS: The bills would remove all export
  restrictions on "mass market" or publicly accessible encryption
  software and similar hardware -- that is, products that are generally
  available to the public and sold for installation "as is," or that are
  in the public domain such as PGP or some popular web browsers. (For
  example, products commercially available "off the rack," or freely
  available to the public via the Internet, would all be exportable.)
  Other encryption hardware would be exportable to countries where
  hardware with similar capabilities is already commercially available.
  The bills also allow export of other encryption software if it is
  currently exportable under law for use by foreign financial
  institutions.

* PROHIBIT ANY RESTRICTION ON THE DOMESTIC USE OR SALE OF ENCRYPTION:
  The bills would affirmatively prohibit any government restrictions or
  attempts to mandate the domestic sale or use of any type of
  encryption.

* IMPOSE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED KEY DISCLOSURES:
  (Senate Version Only) The Senate bill would lay down privacy
  guidelines to protect those users who choose to store their  keys with
  third parties. The bill would impose civil and criminal penalties for
  the unauthorized release of decryption keys or other decryption
  assistance by third parties who individuals have entrusted with their
  keys. No privacy protections and only limited restrictions for law
  enforcement access currently exist for those who choose to store their
  keys with trusted third parties.

* PROVIDE LIMITS FOR ACCESS TO KEYS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT: (Senate Version
  Only) The Senate bill would also spell out limits and guidelines for
  law enforcement access to the keys of those users who have
  chosen to store their keys with third parties. Today, encryption keys
  held by third parties could be released to law enforcement with
  nothing more than a subpoena. Under the Senate bill, third parties
  could only provide assistance to law enforcement in decrypting
  communications if presented with a court order. The bill also limits
  the scope and duration of such assistance. Decryption keys for stored
  communications could be disclosed with a proper court order or
  subpoena.

* ESTABLISH A BROAD "PERSONAL USE EXEMPTION" FOR U.S. TRAVELERS: The
  bills would allow U.S. persons to use any form of encryption in a
  foreign country, establishing a less restrictive form of the "personal
  use exemption" recently published by the State Department. The
  provision is intended to accommodate "U.S. citizens and permanent
  residents who have the need to temporarily export encryption products
  when leaving the U.S. for brief periods of time". While the intent of
  this provision is clear, CDT believes that the language of the bill
  should be further clarified.

* PROHIBIT THE USE OF ENCRYPTION TO CONCEAL THE COMMISSION OF A FELONY:
  Finally, the bills would criminalize the use of encryption to
  willfully obstruct justice.  Anyone who "willfully endeavors" to use
  encryption for the purpose of obstructing, impeding, or preventing the
  communication to a law enforcement officer of information relating to
  a Federal felony would be subject to criminal penalties. CDT believes
  this new federal crime is unnecessary since it duplicates obstruction
  of justice crimes that are already available to prosecutors, and is
  unwise since it might be interpreted to discriminate against users of
  encryption.

BACKGROUND - BILLS ADDRESS LONG-STANDING FRUSTRATIONS WITH U.S.
             ENCRYPTION POLICY

Congressional action comes as Clinton Administration encryption
restrictions continue to jeopardize the security of computer users.
Encryption tools, which scramble electronic communications and data, are
widely viewed as the key to providing security and privacy and encourage
commerce on the Global Information Infrastructure.

Individuals need encryption in order to trust the GII with confidential
data such as financial transactions, medical records, or private
communications.  Businesses need encryption to provide individuals with
privacy protections they need and to protect their own proprietary
information as it flows across vulnerable global networks. The lack of good
encryption today has left computer users vulnerable to the prying eyes of
hackers, corporate competitors, and even foreign governments.

Current Administration policy restricts the export of "strong" encryption
hardware or software products with keys greater than 40 bits long. (The
length of encryption "keys" is often used to indicate the security of a
system.) Export controls actually influence the entire GII -- both
domestically and internationally -- due to the difficulty of distributing
and interoperating products with different strengths of encryption. The
level of security permitted under the export controls, and hence the level
of security largely available to domestic users as well, has been judged
woefully inadequate by many experts. Even the most recent Administration
"Clipper II" proposals would only allow the export of moderately stronger
encryption, and then only with "key escrow" restrictions to guarantee U.S.
government access to individual keys -- restrictions which raise real
Constitutional issues and are bound to fail in the competitive
international marketplace.

In recent months, groups from across the political spectrum have
increasingly criticized the Clinton Administration's restrictive export
controls. In November 40 companies, trade associations, and public interest
groups wrote to Vice President Gore calling the latest Administration
proposals flawed and inadequate. Last month a report by the CEOs of 13
leading U.S. technology companies found that U.S. industry stands to lose
up to $60 billion dollars per year by the year 2000 due to restrictions on
the export of cryptography. And several weeks ago a group of noted computer
security experts released a report calling for the deployment of
dramatically longer encryption key lengths of at least 75 to 90 bits.

The House and Senate bills give voice to this growing drumbeat of criticism
demanding a radical departure from the flawed approach of the Clinton
Administration's current encryption polices. CDT looks forward to working
with members of Congress to push for a more comprehensive U.S. encryption
policy that reflects the privacy and security needs of computer users.

(1) CONGRESS COULD VOTE ON FINAL PASSAGE OF THE CDA TODAY (Thurs 2/1)

House and Senate members of the conference committee considering the 
telecommunications reform legislation, which includes the Exon "Communications 
Decency Act", are expected to give final approval to the bill today, paving 
the way for a vote in the House of Representatives as early as Thursday 
evening (2/1). The schedule for a Senate vote is unclear, although a vote 
before the end of the week is possible. President Clinton is expected to sign 
the bill.

Even if no votes occur today, once the Conference Committee members agree to 
send the bill to the floor of the House and Senate, no further changes can be 
made. 

Ironically, the possible vote comes exactly one year to the day that Senator 
Exon introduced the original Communications Decency Act (Feb. 1, 1995). 
Although significant changes have been made to the CDA since its introduction, 
the proposal is still an unprecedented violation of the First Amendment rights 
of all Internet users, and threatens to destroy the Internet as a viable means 
of free expression, education, and political discourse.  CDT is committed to 
challenging this bill all the way to the supreme court, if necessary, to 
ensure that these provisions are overturned.

The decision to bring the bill to a vote was unexpectedly announced late 
Wednesday 1/31 after Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-KS) dropped his 
objections to provisions granting broadcasters fee access to new digital 
spectrum.

Despite the objections of civil liberties advocates and the telecommunications
and computer industries, Congress is expected to pass the telecommunications
bill with the CDA intact.  However, if you feel strongly about this issue,
you should continue to speak your mind.  An Action Alert prepared by the 
Voters
Telecommunications Watch (VTW) describing what you can do is attached below.

CDT will post an analysis of the final legislation, along with statements
from key members of Congress and other relevant information soon after the 
final vote.  In the mean time, for more information, including the text and 
analysis of the latest proposal (Dec 21, 1995), see CDT's Net-Censorship 
Issues Web Page (http://www.cdt.org), or send email to <cda-info@cdt.org>

THE LATEST NEWS

The Internet censorship legislation, bundled with the Telecommunications
Deregulation bill (S652/HR1555), would impose a speech standard on the 
Internet of "indecency", dumbing down public discourse on the net to
only that which is appropriate for children.   It could be voted on as
early as this Thursday, 2/1/96.

This legislation, available from http://www.cdt.org/cda.html, has changed
consistently for the worse despite the best efforts over the last year of
many public interest groups to bring it in line with the protections outlined
in the First Amendment.

Congress is poised to vote on Thursday, Feburary 1.  We are not hopeful
that Congress will reject the behemoth Telecommunications bill on the basis
of the unconstitutional Internet censorship language.  It is likely to pass,
or be cemented in stone to prevent it from changing in any way before a
future vote, should this one be delayed.

This is one issue that, despite the legislative efforts of the best civil
liberties representatives on the planet, will have to be resolved in court.

________________________________________________________________________
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

It is unlikely that even a massive public outcry will be enough to defeat
the Telecommunications Deregulation bill.  We do feel that you should
continue to speak your mind however, and remind Congress that you are
concerned about the callousness with which they treat the First Amendment
in a medium they often have little experience in.  Remember, no matter
how bad it gets this year, someone will probably introduce a similar
bill next year, and we'll need to continue to educate these people all over
again.

1. Call your Senators and Representatives and tell them you find the
   net censorship provisions unacceptable.  A complete list of legislators
   can be found at http://www.house.gov/ and http://www.senate.gov/.
   In addition, you can try looking up your Senator with the Zipper, a

        YOU
        Congress is about to vote on provisions of the telecommunications 
        reform bill which will cripple the Internet as a viable means of
        free expression, education, and commerce.  I am outraged that this
        proposal has made it this far.  Please do everything in your power
        to remove these provisions from the bill.

        RECEPTIONIST
        Ok, thanks for calling!

2. If anything interesting transpires during the call, send us email at
   vtw@vtw.org so we can investigate.

        $ Mail vtw@vtw.org
        Subject: called Senator Dongle

        I called Senator Dongle, and his staff says that they weren't
        aware that anyone had a problem with the Internet censorship
        language.  Perhaps you should pay them a visit.

        ^D
        Mail sent!

3. Sit back and watch the court challenge.  We hoped it wouldn't have to come
   to this.

Sep 26, '95     Sen. Russ Feingold urges committee members to drop
                Managers Amendment and the CDA from the Telecommunications
                Deregulation bill
Aug  4, '95     House passes HR1555 which goes into conference with S652.
Aug  4, '95     House votes to attach Managers Amendment (which contains

                Telecommunications Reform bill (HR1555).
Aug  4, '95     House votes 421-4 to attach HR1978 to Telecommunications
                Reform bill (HR1555).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) CDT RECOMMENDS AMENDMENTS TO BOLSTER "MEDICAL RECORDS CONFIDENTIALITY
    ACT" (S. 1360)

This coming May, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee will
consider important privacy legislation designed to protect the
confidentiality of medical records. Introduced last fall by Senators Robert
Bennett (R-Utah) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), and co-sponsored by
Senators Kassebaum, Kennedy, Dole, Daschle, and others, the "Medical
Records Confidentiality Act" (S. 1360) seeks to create strong,
comprehensive privacy safeguards for the health data of all Americans.

Among provisions, the "Medical Records Confidentiality Act" would:

*  Give people the right to get a copy of their own medical record;

*  Limit disclosure of personal health information by doctors,
   employers, insurance companies and others in the health care
   arena; and,

*  Would establish stiff civil and criminal penalties for
   unauthorized disclosures of information.

For a summary of S.1360, CDT's testimony on the need for medical records
privacy protections, and other information please visit CDT's Health
Information Privacy Web Page at http://www.cdt.org/health_priv.html

CDT supports the Bennett-Leahy bill and believes that its enactment would
be an important first step in creating strong, enforceable privacy
protections where few currently exist. (See CDT Policy Post No. 27).

When S. 1360 was first introduced last fall, some in the privacy community
argued that the bill did not go far enough.  Over the past several months,
CDT, along with other public interest advocates and consumer groups, has
developed the following proposed changes to the bill which we believe are
necessary in order to strengthen the proposal and ensure that individuals
are better able to control access to and disclosure of their private health
records.  Among the proposed changes, CDT recommends the committee:

1. Eliminate current exemptions which allow health information to be
   disclosed to researchers without an individual's consent.

2. Eliminate current exemptions which allow doctors, insurance
   companies, and other health information trustees to disclose health
   information to government officials involved in health oversight
   activities without an individual's consent.

3. Raise the standard for law enforcement access to health records

4. Place tighter controls on access to health information inside health
   care institutions.

S.1360 will be before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee in
early May.  The House is expected to hold hearings on the companion bill,
H.R.435, in the Spring. CDT urges the committee to adopt these changes when
it considers S. 1360 in early May, and looks forward to working with
Committee members to ensure that S. 1360 contains strong privacy
safeguards.

Our nation is rapidly developing a health information infrastructure that
will make it possible to quickly transmit and access health information for
treatment and payment purposes. This brings obvious public health benefits,
such as improving patient care, increasing patient access to treatment and
lowering costs. However, the risk of abuse is magnified when health records
are transmitted and stored
electronically. CDT believes that S. 1360 will help to bring the benefits
of the health information infrastructure while ensuring privacy and
confedentiality of sensitive medical information.

CDT is pleased that other privacy and consumer groups are actively working
to ensure that S.1360 is strengthened.  The Consumer Project on Technology,
the Coalition for Patient's Rights, and many others have voiced similar
concerns to the Committee.  As a result of the collective comments
submitted by privacy and consumer organizations, we believe that the final
bill will contain stronger, more comprehensive protections for personal
health information.

the text of the bill, analysis, CDT's testimony before the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee, and other relevant information, visit CDT's

(2) CDT RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COMMITTEE


*  ELIMINATE CURRENT EXCEPTION TO CONSENT FOR CREATION OF NON-
   IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.

As drafted, S. 1360 would allow protected health information to be
disclosed without an individual's consent to certified health information
services, for the sole purpose of creating non-identifiable information.

CDT recommends that this provision be stricken from the bill.  Trustees
(such as doctors, hospitals, or insurance companies) should be prohibited
from disclosing personal health information without individual consent in
all but the most compelling circumstances.  If a trustee chooses to
de-identify, or strip data, they may do so.  CDT believes that a health
information service should only handle personal information when they are
acting as an employee, agent, or contractor of a health care provider or
health plan.

*  ELIMINATE CURRENT EXCEPTION TO CONSENT FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES.

S.1360 currently allows protected health information to be disclosed to
researchers without an individual's consent.  CDT urges the Committee to
affirm the individual's right to control disclosure of personal health
information by requiring that the individual's consent be obtained by the
provider or health plan prior to disclosing personal health information to
a researcher, unless exceptional circumstances are presented that justify a
waiver.

We recommend that federal regulations requiring federally-funded
researchers to obtain the individual's consent be adapted to govern all
researcher access to personally identifiable records.  Through adoption of
a consent mechanism, the bill would provide a strong incentive for
researchers to use non-identifiable data where possible.

*  ELIMINATE CURRENT EXCEPTION TO CONSENT FOR OVERSIGHT PURPOSES.

S.1360 currently allows health information trustees (such as doctors,
insurance companies) to disclose protected health information without an
individual's consent to government officials involved in health oversight
activities, such as reducing fraud and abuse.  As drafted, the bill
prohibits information obtained during an oversight activity from being used
in an action against an individual (if not related to health fraud or
abuse).

CDT believes that the legislation be amended to require oversight officials
to obtain a subpoena prior to seeking access to records. By requiring legal
process, government officials would have to justify their requests for
information, providing a much needed method of ensuring public
accountability.  In conjunction with the substantial protection for
individuals afforded by the current limitation on using the information
against the individual in an unrelated action.  This amendment would hinder
any government effort to use oversight activities as fishing expeditions.

These recommended changes to the bill would give individuals the greatest
degree of control over the use and disclosure of personal health
information by restricting unauthorized disclosures of personal health
information.

*  HEIGHTEN STANDARD CONTROLLING LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCESS.

As drafted S.1360 requires law enforcement personnel to present a warrant
to health information trustees when seeking access to personal health
information -- the bill does not require trustees to disclose the
information.  However, the warrant requirement in the Bennett-Leahy bill
contains a standard that is weaker than the standard governing access to
subscriber records under the Cable Communications Act.

CDT urges the Committee to strengthen the standard governing law
enforcement access to personal health information.   The bill should be
amended to provide a heightened standard governing access that is as strong
as, if not stronger, than the standard found in the Cable Communications
Act.  It would be absurd to have weaker privacy protections for peoples'
medical records than for their cable records.

CDT believes that personal health information is some of the most sensitive
and revealing information about individuals and is therefore entitled to
the strongest legal safeguards.  Law enforcement personnel should be forced
to make a very compelling showing of evidence and need before they are
given access to peoples' medical records.

*  LIMIT INSIDER ACCESS.

CDT is concerned that the bill as drafted does not clearly convey that
access to information within an institution must be limited and regulated
as closely as disclosure of information outside the institution.

CDT urges the Committee to clarify the language restricting internal uses
of protected health information.  Internal uses of information must be
limited to those that are both compatible with and directly related to the
purpose of collection.  In addition, the minimization requirement governing
all disclosures of information must also govern internal use of
information.  For instance, while within health care institutions a number
of health care professionals may be involved in a patient's care and need
access to information in the patient's record, there must be limits on who
has access and the amount of information they are provided.

Although some groups have raised concerns about the preemption language of
S.1360, after a review of state laws regarding confidentiality of and
access to medical information, CDT is confident that the protections and
penalties provided by S.1360 are more comprehensive and stronger than those
provided under existing law.  Moreover, the preemption provision is not
absolute.  S.1360 leaves states free to craft stronger privacy laws in the
areas of mental health, public health (communicable disease), and
doctor-patient privilege.  In addition, where more protective court
decisions exist in the area of doctor-patient confidentiality, they too
would remain undisturbed.  Lastly, S.1360 would not preempt state laws that
prohibit discrimination based on health information -- such as laws that
prohibit discrimination based on an individual's genetic information.

S.1726

IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES


Mr. Burns introduced the following bill: which was read twice and 
    referred to the Committee on ________________________________

    _________________________________________


                             A BILL

To promote electronic commerce by facilitating the use of 
       strong encryption, and for other purposes.

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the "Promotion of Commerce On-Line
in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996"

SEC.2.FINDING;PURPOSE

   (a) FINDINGS. - The Congress finds the following:
          
           (1) The ability to digitize information makes
        carrying out tremendous amounts of commerce and 
        personal communication electronically possible.
           (2) Miniaturization, distributed computing, and
        reduced transmission costs make communication via
        electronic networks a reality.
           (3) The explosive growth in the Internet and 
        other computer networks reflects the potential
        growth of electronic commerce and personal
        communication.
           (4) The Internet and the global information
        infrastructure have the potential to revolutionize
        the way individuals and businesses conduct business.
           (5) The full potential of the Internet for the
        conduct of business cannot be realized as long as it 
        is an insecure medium in which confidential business
        information and sensitive personal information       
        remain at risk of unauthorized viewing, alteration,
        and use.
           (6) Encryption of information enables busi-
        nesses and individuals to protect themselves against
        the unauthorized viewing, alteration, and use of 
        information by employing widely understood and  
        readily available science and technology to ensure
        the confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of
        information.
           (7) In order to promote economic growth and
        meet the needs of businesses and individuals in the
        United States, a variety of encryption products and
        programs should be available to promote good, flexi-
        ble, and commercially acceptable encryption capab-
        ilities.
           (8) United States computer, computer software and
        hardware, communications, and electronics business are         
        leading the world technology revolution, as those
        businesses have developed and are prepared to offer 
        immediately to computer users worldwide a variety of 
        communications and computers hardware and computer
        software that provide good, robust, and easy-to-use
        encryption.
           (9) United States businesses seek to market the
        products described in paragraph (8) in competition
        with scores of foreign businesses in many countries
        that offer similar, and frequently stronger, encryp-
        tion products and programs.
            (10) United States businesses have been discouraged
        from further developing and marketing products with 
        encryption capabilities because of regulatory efforts
        by the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the 
        National Institute Of Standards and Technology and 
        other entities of the Department of Commerce, to
        promulgate standards and guidelines in support of 
        government-designed solutions to encryption problems 
        that-
              (A) were not developed in the private sector;
                  and
              (B) have not received widespread commercial
                  support.
          (11) Because of outdated Federal controls, United
        States businesses have been prohibited from exporting
        goods encryption products and programs.
          (12) The Secretary of Commerce, acting through the
        National Institute of Standards and Technology has 
        attempted to leverage the desire of United States 
        businesses to sell commercial products to the United 
        States Government, and sell a single product 
        worldwide, to force the businesses to include features 
        in products sold by the businesses in the United States 
        and in foreign countries that will allow the Federal 
        Government easy access to the plain text of all 
        electronic information and communications.         
          (13) Specifically, the Secretary of Commerce, acting
        through the National Institute of Standards and  
        Technology, has proposed that United states businesses  
        be allowed to sell products and programs offering good  
        encryption to the United States Government, and in  
        foreign countries only if the products and programs 
        include a feature guaranteeing the Federal 
        Government access to a key that decrypts information
        (hereafter in this section referred to as "key escrow  
        encryption").
          (14) The key escrow encryption approach to regulating 
        encryption is reflected in the approval in 1994 by the 
        National Institute of Standards and Technology of a 
        Federal information processing standard for a standard
        known as the "clipper chip", that was flawed and 
        controversial.
          (15) The Federal Government-
               (A) has designed key escrow encryption to solve 
                   a perceived problem; and
               (B) has ignored the fact that-
                   (i) there is no demonstrated commercial 
                      demand for features which give 
                      governments easy access to information; 
                      and  
                   (ii) numerous nonkey escrow encryption
                      alternatives are available commercially 
                      from foreign suppliers and free of charge
                      from the Internet.
          (16) In order to promote electronic commerce in the
               twenty-first century to realize the full 
               potential of the Internet and other computer
               networks-            
               (A) United States businesses should be       
                   encouraged to develop and market products
                   and programs offering encryption 
                   capabilities; and 
               (B) the Federal Government should be prohibited
                   from promulgating regulations and adopting
                   policies that discourage the use and sale of
                   encryption.
   (b) PURPOSE- The purpose of this Act is to promote electronic
commerce through the use of strong encryption by-
          (1) recognizing that businesses in the United States 
        that offer computer hardware and computer software made 
        in the United States that incorporate encryption
        technology are ready and immediately able, with respect 
        to electronic information that will be essential to
        conducting business in the twenty-first century to
        provide products that are designed to-
               (A) protect the confidentiality of that
                   information: and
               (B) ensure the authenticity and integrity
                   of that information;
          (2) restricting the Department of Commerce with
        respect to the promulgation or enforcement of regulations,
        or the application of policies, that impose government-
        designed encryption standards; and     
          (3) promoting the ability of United States businesses
        to sell to computer users worldwide computer software and
        computer hardware that provide the strong encryption
        demanded by such users by-
               (A) restricting Federal or State regulation of the
                   sale of such products and programs in
                   interstate commerce;
               (B) prohibiting mandatory key escrow encryption
                   systems; and
               (C) establishing conditions for the sale of
                   encryption products and programs in foreign
                   commerce.

(1) 27 REPRESENTATIVES URGE PRESIDENT CLINTON TO ABANDON KEY-ESCROW POLICY

A bi-partisan group of 27 Congressmen, led by Reps. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA)
and Tom Campbell (R-CA) on Wednesday (5/15) sent a letter to President
Clinton urging the President to abandon the Administration's key-escrow
encryption proposal and "instead immediately liberalize export controls on
non-key escrow encryption technology."

Expressing "serious concerns" about the impact of current U.S. encryption
policy on individual privacy and US competitiveness, the bi-partisan group
wrote: "The ability of companies and individuals to ensure that the
information they send over communications and computer networks is secure
is a prerequisite to exploiting the potential of the Global Information
Infrastructure."

The letter was signed by several prominent members from both parties,
including Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), Tom Campbell (R-CA), Anna Eshoo (D-CA),
Rick Boucher (D-VA), Bob Barr (R-GA), Pat Schroeder (D-CO), Carlos
Moorehead (R-CA), and 20 other members.

The bi-partisan call to President Clinton to abandon the Administration's
key escrow policy is yet another encouraging sign of increasingly strong
Congressional support for reform of US encryption policy.  Congress is
currently considering several bills designed to encourage the widespread
availability privacy-protecting technologies for the Internet by lifting
export controls on strong encryption:

* HR 3011, the "Security and Freedom Through Encryption (SAFE) Act of
  1996", sponsored by over 30 members including  Reps Goodlatte (R-VA),
  Campbell (R-CA), Eshoo (D-CA), Boucher (D-VA).

* S. 1726, the "Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era (Pro-
  CODE) act of 1996, sponsored by Senators Burns (R-MT), Leahy (D-VT),
  Pressler (R-SD), Dole (R-KS), Wyden (D-OR), and Murray (D-WA)

* S. 1587, the "Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996", also
  sponsored by Senators Burns and Leahy.

Hearings on HR 3011 (Rep Goodlatte's bill) and the Burns/Leahy S. 1726
(Pro-CODE) are expected in June.

INTERNET SECURITY DAY - A NATIONAL DISCUSSION ON THE NEED TO REFORM US
ENCRYPTION POLICY

In July, CDT and over 25 other organizations will hold a daylong education

(1) SENATE ENCRYPTION HEARING ILLUSTRATES SEA CHANGE IN POLICY DEBATE

On Wednesday June 26, 1996 the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science,
Space, and Technology held a hearing to consider legislation designed to
encourage the widespread availability of strong, easy-to-use, privacy and
security technologies for the Internet.  Wednesday's hearing illustrated
that a sea change has occurred in Congressional attitude towards the
encryption policy debate.

While members of the Subcommittee noted the complex law enforcement issues
raised by the encryption policy debate, the Senators also recognized that
because of the global nature of the Internet, top down regulations such as
export controls and centralized government mandates like the Clipper
schemes will not address the needs of individuals, business, and even law
enforcement in the Information Age.

In addition, several Senators noted that future of electronic commerce,
privacy, and the competitiveness of the US computer industry should not be
held hostage to law enforcement considerations.

This change in Congressional attitude towards encryption policy is
significant and extremely encouraging.

Wednesday's hearing was also significant because it was the first ever
Congressional hearing cybercast live on the Internet. Details on the
Cybercast are attached below.

The hearing, chaired by Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT), was called to consider
the Promotion Of Commerce Online in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) legislation,
which would relax current regulations restricting the export of strong
encryption.

Witnesses testifying before the panel included:

* Phil Zimmermann, Inventor of PGP
* Whit Diffie, Sun Microsystems, Father of Public-Key Cryptography
* Phil Karn, Qualcomm Inc, Cryptographer
* Marc Rotenberg, Director, Electronic Privacy Information Center
* Jerry Berman, Executive Director, Center for Democracy and Technology
* Matt Blaze, Lucent Technologies Cryptographer,
* Barbara Simons, Chair of US Public Policy Committee, ACM
* And 135 Netizens (http://www.crypto.com)

CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman also testified before the Subcommittee.
Noting that the current US encryption policy has left individual Internet
users without adequate privacy and businesses without necessary security,
Berman urged Congress to instead move forward to reform US policy based on
the following principals:

* THE INTERNET IS NOT LIKE A TELEPHONE SYSTEM: The traditional approach
  to wiretapping cannot simply be extended to the Internet. This new
  medium encompasses a range of social functions far beyond simple two-
  way voice communication.  These broad activities demand a heightened
  capacity for uses to protect their security and privacy online.

* THE INTERNET IS A GLOBAL, DECENTRALIZED MEDIUM: Efforts to impose
  unilateral national policies -- such as export controls or key escrow
  proposals -- are unlikely to be accepted widely.  Decentralized user
  choice solutions to privacy problems are preferable to and more
  effective than centralized, governmental mandates (such as the
  Clipper proposals).

* ON THE INTERNET, THE BILL OF RIGHTS IS A LOCAL ORDINANCE:
  Constitutional guarantees of privacy and free expression to U.S.
  Citizens whose communications regularly cross national borders.
  Policies should be designed to protect Americans outside the shelter
  of U.S. law.

Berman expressed CDT's strong support for Congressional efforts to reform
US Encryption policy, and urged Congress to act quickly to liberalize
export controls and provide American Internet users with the strong
security and privacy they so badly need.

Audio transcripts of the Hearing, copies of the prepared statements of the
witnesses, and other background information is available at CDT's
encryption policy web page: http://www.cdt.org/crypto/

HEARING SHOWS NEW SENSE OF URGENCY AND FOCUS IN CONGRESS

The clearest example of the emerging frustration in Congress with the
current export restrictions came in an exchange between Senator John
Aschroft (R-MO) and Phil Karn, a cryptographer with Qualcomm and a
plaintiff in a case challenging the export restrictions:

Sen. Aschroft: So for all other countries, the world is the market, but
               for American companies, America is the only market and
               the rest of the world is off limits?

Karn:          You've got it.

Sen. Aschroft: Mr. Chairman, I think that's one of the reasons we need
               to look very carefully at the bill (Pro-CODE) we are
               looking at here today...

Sen. Aschroft: In all our discussions about whether it (cryptography) is
               good or bad, we ignore the fact that it's THERE, and it
               can be available to Americans by American companies, it
               cannot be available to anyone else by American companies,
               but it can be available around the world by a company in
               any other country.

This exchange, as well as strong statements in support of the Burns
Pro-CODE bill from Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and
Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), who made the unusual move of coming to
a Senate hearing, show that Congress is finally giving the need to reform
US encryption policy serious support.

A hearing of the full Senate Commerce Committee, chaired by Senator Larry
Pressler (R-SD) is expected in mid July.  Representatives from the
Administration and Law Enforcement agencies are expected to testify.  CDT
is working with Senator Burns' and Senator Pressler to bring that hearing
live online.  Check CDT's "Congress and the Net" Web Page at
http://www.cdt.org/net_congress/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(2) FIRST EVER CYBERCAST OF CONGRESSIONAL HEARING SHOWS CONGRESS'
    GROWING DESIRE TO REACH OUT TO THE INTERNET COMMUNITY

Wednesday's hearing was the first Congressional hearing to be cybercast
live on the Internet.  The cybercast, coordinated at the request of Senator
Burns by the Center for Democracy and Technology, HotWired, DIGEX, and the
Voters Telecommunications Watch, provided Netizens around the world with
the opportunity to be a part of the Congressional debate on an important
Internet policy issue.

By reaching out to the net.community and providing netizens with an
opportunity to participate in the hearing (Senator Burns asked several
questions posed by the online audience), the cybercast marked an historic
moment in the evolution of the net.community as a political force.

In addition to a live audio feed from the hearing, approximately 40
netizens participated in a simultaneous discussion of the hearing in a chat
area on HotWired.  A member of Senator Burns' staff also joined the
discussion from inside the hearing room, providing insights into the
proceedings, answering questions from the audience, and delivering audience
questions to Senator Burns.

The goal of the hearing cybercast, as well as other recent CDT sponsored
online discussions with members of Congress, is to bring the net.community
and Congress together on critical Internet policy issues in order to
encourage a constructive dialogue and mutual understanding.
CDT is pleased to have been a part of this historic event, and looks
forward to bringing the next Senate Encryption hearing tentatively set for
mid-July online.

(1) Key Senators Strengthen Medical Privacy Bill: Mark-up Set for April 24

Today, Senators Nancy Kassebaum (R-KA) and Edward Kennedy (D-MA) released a 
stronger, more privacy-sensitive rewrite of the Medical Records 
Confidentiality Act (S.1360), also known as the Bennett-Leahy bill after 
its chief sponsors. The bill is scheduled to be considered by the full Labor
and Human Resources Committee on April 24. If the Committee approves the bill,
S.1360 will be ready to be voted on by the full Senate in the coming months. 

The revised Bennett-Leahy bill incorporates many of the key changes 
recommended by CDT (see CDT policy post March 19, 1996) and members of a 
CDT-led coalition, including AIDS Action Council, the Legal Action Center, 
the Center for Patients' Rights, IBM, AARP, the American Hospital 
Association, and the Association of Academic Health Centers. In addition, the
bill includes revisions suggested by Public Citizen, the Coalition for 
Patient's Rights, the ACLU, and EPIC.

In its current form, CDT believes that S.1360 is an extremely strong and 
enforceable medical privacy bill, which would give people the right to see
their own records, prohibit disclosures of most personal medical data without
the patient's consent, and bring heavy criminal and civil penalties to bear 
on those who violate the law. The revised S.1360, like its predecessor, is 
more stringent than any medical records privacy law currently on the books at
either the state or federal level. If passed, the Bennett-Leahy bill will 
give people the greatest degree of control over the use and disclosure of 
their personal medical data. CDT hopes that the Senate Labor Committee will 
unanimously approve the amended S.1360.

Significant changes to S. 1360 include:

 o  A new section has been added to S.1360 that lays out the principles 
underlying the bill, including that people have a right of confidentiality 
in their medical records that is being eroded, and that such erosion may 
jeopardize the quality of health care by reducing peoples' willingness to 
confide in their doctors.

 o  The revised S.1360 narrows instances under which protected health 
information may be disclosed without the individual's consent. Under S.1360 
as introduced, a number of disclosures of personal health information were 
allowed without the individual's consent, such as to researchers and for 
the purpose of creating nonidentifiable data. Both of these exceptions to 
consent have been eliminated. S.1360 now requires researchers who want 
access to identifiable data to get the record subject's consent, unless 
they can meet a waiver standard already in place for federally funded 
researchers.  

 o  The revised S.1360 removes "health information services" from being 
treated as trustees, and now only allows them to receive personal health 
information with an individual's consent. Now, trustees, such as doctors, 
hospitals, and insurance companies, must anonymize personal health 
information prior to disclosing it to health information services, such as 
EDS or Equifax. A health information service may only strip the identifiers 
if they are under the control of a trustee as an employee or contractor. 
This change is a major improvement in the bill, which will significantly 
limit the number of people who get access to sensitive medical data. 
Overall, the bill creates a big incentive to use health data in 
nonidentifiable form. 

 o  S.1360 now includes a higher "clear and convincing evidence" standard 
that law enforcement must meet before a warrant can be issued for access to 
personal medical information.

 o  S.1360 has now been narrowed by clarifying that insider access to medical 
records must be limited. The bill now states explicitly that internal 
disclosures of personal health information must be compatible with and 
directly related to the purposes for which the information was collected.

For more information on the Medical Records Privacy legislation, including

available), CDT's recommended changes to S.1360, CDT's testimony before the

(1) JOIN SENATOR BURNS ON HOTWIRED TONIGHT (5/13) AT 9:00 ET ON TO DISCUSS
    PRIVACY AND SECURITY ON THE NET

Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT) will hold a second online 'town meeting' tonight
to discuss recently introduced encryption legislation.  The Promotion of 
Commerce Online in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996 (S.1726), sponsored
by Sen. Burns, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and others, seeks to relax outdated 
and restrictive export controls on encryption.  

This online chat is the second chance in as many weeks for Netizens to 
participate in a discussion regarding this important legislation.  We hope 
many concerned Internet users will take advantage of this rare opportunity 
to interact with a U.S. Senator who is leading the fight on an issue of great 
importance to the Net.community.

DETAILS ON TONIGHT'S EVENT:

* Monday May 13, at 9:00 pm ET (6:00 pm Pacific) on HotWired's "Wireside
  Chat".  

  URL: http://www.hotwired.com/wiredside/

  To participate, you must be a registered HotWired member (there 
  is no charge for registration).  You must also have RealAudio(tm) and a
  telnet application properly configured to work with your browser.

Tonight's town meeting is the second in a series of planned events, and is
part of a broader project coordinated by CDT and the Voters
Telecommunications Watch (VTW) designed to bring the Internet Community
into the debate and encourage members of Congress to work with the
Net.community on vital Internet policy issues.

Events with other members of Congress working on Internet Policy Issues are
currently being planned. Stay tuned for future announcements.

(1) SENATOR BURNS ANNOUNCES BILL TO LIFT CRYPTO EXPORT CONTROLS

The battle to roll back the Clinton Administration's encryption policy
escalated on Thursday when Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT) announced that he
will introduce a new proposal to repeal restrictions on encryption exports
and to encourage the growth of electronic commerce. Senator Burns announced
the bill via a teleconference during a special session at the Computers,
Freedom, and Privacy Conference in Boston, MA.

The bill, titled the "Promoting Commerce On-Line in the Digital Age Act"
(PROCODE), joins two recent bills introduced earlier this month (S. 1587
and HR 3011) designed to encourage the development of strong, easy-to-use
privacy and security products for the Internet.

The Burns bill is different from the other proposals in several respects.
Specifically, the latest bill does not contain any new criminal provisions
or provisions imposing liability on third party key holders.

In his presentation today at CFP, Sen. Burns outlined his new bill. Among 
other things, the "Promoting Commerce On-Line in the Digital Age Act" 
would:

* Allow for the unrestricted export of "mass-market" or "public-domain"
  encryption programs, including such products as Pretty Good Privacy
  and popular World Wide Web software. Encryption software and hardware 
  for sale in local software stores or widely available on the Internet 
  would all be exportable under the proposed Act.

* Require the Secretary of Commerce to allow the unrestricted export of
  other encryption technologies if products of similar strength are
  generally available outside the United States.

* Prohibit the Federal Government from imposing mandatory key-escrow
  encryption policies on the domestic market.

* Limit the authority of the Secretary of Commerce to set standards for
  encryption products.

CDT applauds this effort by Senator Burns to put strong privacy and
security technologies in the hands of individuals and businesses. CDT is
also pleased that the Senator chose the Computers, Freedom, and Privacy
Conference as a forum to announce this proposal. The choice of CFP
demonstrates that the Internet community is becoming an increasingly
important political constituency.

CDT looks forward to working with Senator Burns and other members of
Congress interested in policies which encourage the development and
widespread use of strong privacy protecting technologies for the Global
Information Infrastructure.

(1) DEADLINE TO JOIN CIEC CHALLENGE TO CDA EXTENDED!

As of 5:00 pm Thurs. March 14, nearly 25,300 individuals have joined the
Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition (CIEC) legal challenge to the
Communications Decency Act.  This historic legal challenge will determine
both the fate of the Internet and the future of freedom of expression in 
the Information Age.  To allow more Internet users to participate in this
landmark case, the deadline for individuals to join the Citizens Internet
Empowerment Coalition (CIEC) legal challenge to the Communications Decency 
Act has been extended.

Individuals who join the CIEC before March 31, 1996 will be added to the
Coalition documents to be filed in the Federal Court in Philadelphia.  The
coalition will remain open after March 31 until just before the case
reaches the Supreme Court (expected late 1996).   The goal is to have as
many individual members of the CIEC as possible by the time the case
reaches the Supreme Court (regardless of who wins the first court
challenge, slated to begin on March 21 and last through April 12, either
side can immediately appeal to the Supreme Court).

For more information, including information on how you can join the fight,
visit the CIEC home page at: http://www.cdt.org/ciec/

The 25,300 individual CIEC members, collected in just over 17 days, is a
truly astounding representation of the breadth the net.community's concern
over the impact of the Communications Decency Act.  Under the CDA, every
Internet user who posts messages to Usenet Newsgroups, public listervs, IRC
or online chat sessions, or maintains their own World Wide Web page is
potentially subject to $250,000 fines and 2 years in prison if someone
somewhere considers the material "indecent".  CIEC members believe that
this law is clearly unconstitutional and threatens the viability of the
Internet as a medium for free expression, education, and commerce.

COURT TO HEAR THE CASE BEGINNING MARCH 21

The CIEC challenge, which has been consolidated with another challenge
mounted by the ACLU, EFF, EPIC, and other plaintiffs, will be argued before
a 3 judge panel in a Philadelphia Federal Court beginning Thursday March
21. The schedule for the hearings are as follows:

March 21, 22 & April 1:  CIEC and ACLU lawyers and witnesses
April 11, 12:            Dept. of Justice lawyers and witnesses

CDT, with the cooperation of the Justice Department, the clerk of the
Philadelphia Federal Court, and Bell Atlantic, has arranged to wire the
Court Room for Internet access. We are installing a T1 line and a small
local area network with at least 3 computers to enable the court to see the
Internet and view demonstrations of parental control technologies.  To the
best of our knowledge, this represents the first time a Federal Court has
been wired to the Internet for the purposes of a trial.

CDT is also working out arrangements to provide real-time updates of the
court proceedings.  Please stay tuned for more information, and continue to
visit CDT's home page for more information (URL:http://www.cdt.org)

BACKGROUND ON THE CIEC CHALLENGE

The Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition challenge, which in addition to
the 25,300 individuals includes libraries, online service providers,
newspaper and book publishers, commercial and non-commercial content
providers, and public interest advocates, argues that the Internet is a
unique communications medium.  Because of the tremendous user control
inherent in interactive media, and because the Internet provides
essentially unlimited publishing capacity, broad, mass-media content
regulations such as those imposed by the Communications Decency Act are
overly restrictive and therefore unconstitutional.

The CDA is so broad that it encompasses material such as the '7 dirty
words', classic works of fiction such as the Catcher in the Rye or Ulysses,
Sex education and AIDS education materials, artwork, and other
constitutionally protected materials. Although some of this material may
not be appropriate for children, it is protected by the Constitution. Under
the CDA, the very same material which is legal today in newspapers,
magazines, and books would be *illegal* if posted to a public forum on the
Internet. As a result, the CDA threatens to chill the free flow of
information and create second-class status for online speech.

The Supreme Court has consistently ruled that the government may only
regulate constitutionally protected speech if it employs the "least
restrictive means".  Because of the availability of strong, effective user
empowerment technologies such as SurfWatch, Cyberpatrol, PICS, etc., the
broad content regulations imposed by the CDA are clearly not the "least
restrictive means" and are therefore unconstitutional.

(1) SENATOR BURNS GOES ONLINE TO DISCUSS PRIVACY AND SECURITY ON THE NET

Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT) joined Netizens in an online town meeting last
night (Monday 5/6) to discuss the recently introduced Promotion of Commerce
Online in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996 (S. 1726). Senator Burns
also discussed the importance of his bill to the future of privacy and
security on the Internet and the need to encourage the widespread
availability of strong, easy-to-use encryption technologies.

Excerpts of the 50 minute discussion are printed below. The full transcript
of the event is available at the Encryption Policy Resource Page:

 URL: http://www.crypto.com/

By bringing together a United States Senator and interested Internet users
in a discussion of an important Internet policy issue, last night's event
illustrates the value of the Net in the political process and the growing
importance of the net.community as a political constituency.  Several more
similar events are planned for the coming weeks (see scheduling information
below).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) EXCERPTS FROM MONDAY NIGHT'S TOWN MEETING

The entire transcript is available at http://www.crypto.com/

Question   : Senator Burns, As a small business in Montana that
             provides web-space to local Montana
             businesses, I'm concerned that the lack of privacy
             and security on the Net will keep many of my
             potential customers from purchasing online. How will
             this bill help?

Sen Burns  : That's exactly why I introduced this bill. Right now
             I don't think any of us feel safe ...
             transmitting our credit card numbers over the
             Internet, and many companies ...
             who have workers around the nation or world are
             worried about how they can safely send ...
             sensitive information back and forth between them. If
             we can raise their level ...
             of security, we can guarantee that that information
             will be sent without unwanted eyes ...
             looking in.


Question   : How will these new crypto bills (PRO-CODE, S.1587, HR
             3011) affect the administration's
                 concerns in the areas of counter terrorism, counter
             narcotics, etc? (Columbia, MD)

Sen Burns  : Well, the point is that these terrorists already have
             access to strong encryption ...
             from other companies around the world. I mean, my
             heavens, you can download it ...
             right over the Internet now. I expect we will have
             conversations with the FBI, with NSA ..
             to address their concerns. But this technology is
             like a lot of other things out there ...
             It can be used for good purposes, but it also can be
             misused. I don't think we want to ...
             ban kitchen knives just because a few evil-doers out
             there are misusing them.


Question   : What do you think the Administration, FBI, and NSA reaction
             to your bill will be? Have you already heard from them?
             (I run an ISP in Missoula, Montana.)

Sen Burns  : We expect them to have some concern with this, and we will
             work with them but we have to understand that the people we
             are concerned with can already gain encryption that is
             already longer than 40 bits on the international market.

(1) NET-FRIENDLY LEGISLATORS ANNOUNCE CONGRESSIONAL INTERNET CAUCUS

A bi-partisan group of members of both the House and Senate on Thursday
3/29 announced the formation of the Congressional Internet Caucus.  The
group, co-founded by Reps. Rick White (R-WA), Rick Boucher (D-VA), Senators
Larry Pressler (R-SD) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) will work to educate members
of Congress about how the Internet works, bring more members of Congress
online, and encourage the use of the Net to facilitate better communication
between members of Congress and their constituents.

The formation of the Caucus represents a tremendous opportunity for the
Internet community to have an even more powerful voice in the many policy
debates affecting the future of the Internet. Additional Caucus members
include Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA), Rep. Chris Cox (R-CA), and Senator
Ron Wyden (D-OR). The Center for Democracy and Technology, the Progress and
Freedom Foundation, other public interest groups and industry associations
serve on the Caucus' advisory committee.

The Caucus has set up a World Wide Web page with information on its
activities and information on how to contact Caucus members:
http://www.house.gov/white/internet_caucus/netcauc.html

CAUCUS BORN OUT OF NEED TO EDUCATE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ABOUT THE NET

In an historic move and an important overture to the Internet community,
Congressman Rick White on Friday March 29 presented an overview of the
Caucus and its goals via teleconference during a special session at the
Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference (CFP) in Boston MA.  CFP is an
annual gathering of the Internet community, law enforcement officials, and
representatives from the computer and communications industry.

During his presentation at CFP, Rep. White told the audience that the
Caucus was formed in part as a result of his frustration that, during the
course of the debate on the recently enacted Communications Decency Act,
many members of Congress voted for the CDA without any knowledge of what
the Internet is. White said that one of the primary goals of the Caucus is
to educate the Congress to ensure that future policy debates on Internet
issues such as Cryptography policy, copyright, and content regulations are
based on a full understanding of and familiarity with the Internet.

Members of Congress who join the Internet Caucus have pledged to the
following five principals:

* Open up Congress so that constituents can have more information from
  and more access to their elected representatives.

* Network with the Internet community to receive their input on the
  issues affecting the Internet that come before Congress.

* Learn more about how the Internet works and how to use it.

* Increase member's usage of the Internet by working to get more members
  of Congress online by the end of this year.

* In Ninety days, get online by maintaining a World Wide Web site and
  public email for constituents.

* Educate members of Congress about the Internet and raise the level of
  knowledge on upcoming Internet issues that Congress will deal with in
  the Information Age.

The formation of the Caucus comes not a moment too soon. In the wake of the
passage of the Communications Decency Act, Congress is poised to consider
several other issues which will have tremendous implications on the future
of the Internet, including Cryptography Policy and Copyright.  As we saw
with the passage of the Communications Decency Act, bad Internet policy is
the direct result of a lack of understanding of the Net and how it
functions. CDT looks forward to working with the Caucus to help educate
Congress on the nature of the Internet and to encourage the use of the
Internet to promote dialogue between members of Congress and their
constituents. CDT believes that the Internet Caucus will play a critical
role in ensuring that the concerns of the Internet community are
represented in Congress.

(1) HOUSE CONFEREES TO VOTE WEDNESDAY ON FATE OF THE NET

On Wednesday December 6, members of the House conference committee will 
vote on how to deal with the controversial "cyberporn" issue. The full 
House/Senate conference committee will consider the issue within the 
next two weeks.

After months of contentious debate, the conferees must now choose 
between two proposals: one proposal sponsored by Representative Henry 
Hyde (R-IL) and an alternative proposed by Rep. Rick White (R-WA).  The 
Hyde proposal would severely restrict freedom of speech on the Internet, 
and grant the Federal Communications Commission new authority to 
regulate online content. The White proposal relies on parents, not 
federal bureaucrats, to determine what material is and is not 
appropriate for themselves and their children, though it also imposes 
new criminal penalties for individuals who transmit material that is 
"harmful to minors".

The outcome of this decision will have tremendous implications on the 
future of freedom of expression and the development of interactive media 
as a whole. If the Hyde proposal prevails, the Internet as we know it 
will never be the same. 

CDT firmly believes that no new laws in this area are necessary. Current 
law is already working to punish online stalkers and prosecute the 
distribution of obscene material online. However, choosing nothing is 
not an option available to the Conference Committee. Given the options 
before the committee, CDT believes that the effort of Congressman White 
should be commended. He has tried to find a resolution to this issue 
which preserves freedom of speech and relies on user empowerment over 
government control of online content. Rep. White's proposal represents 
the only option on the table which will not destroy the Internet and the 
future of interactive communications technologies. Although this is a 
difficult choice for the Net.Community, White must prevail at this 
stage.

The Hyde proposal, which is being pushed heavily by the Christian 
Coalition, would severely restrict freedom of speech and the democratic 
potential of the Internet and other interactive media. It fails to 
recognize the global, decentralized nature of interactive media and its 
tremendous ability for user control. The proposal would be wholly 
ineffective at accomplishing its stated objective of protecting children 
from objectionable material, while destroying the Internet in the 
process.

If the conferees choose Hyde's approach over White, the Federal 
Communications Commission will, for the first time ever, have the 
authority to regulate online content and the underlying technologies of 
the net itself. In addition, the First Amendment and the free flow of 
information online will be chilled by an overly broad "indecency" 
standard. Online service providers will be forced to monitor all traffic 
to ensure that no "indecent" material is transmitted (creating a 
nightmare for freedom of speech and privacy), or shut down some service 
all together for fear of expensive law suits or prison sentences. And 
although all these provisions can be challenged in court, recent history 
with the so-called "dial-a-porn" and indecency an cable channels 
(Alliance for Community Media vs. FCC) suggest that such challenges can 
take years to resolve, and even then with no guarantee of success.

Representative White's approach seeks to protect cyberspace from 
intrusion by the federal government, and to empower parents to make 
decisions about what is and is not appropriate for themselves and for 
their children. While the proposal does contain new criminal provisions, 
including restrictions on the display of material that is "harmful to 
minors", it also creates a defense to prosecution for those who take 
good faith, reasonable efforts to label content and enable others to 
block it using user control technologies. 

The fate of the Net, and the future of freedom of speech and the 
democratic potential of interactive media, now rests in the hands of the 
conference committee members.

OVERVIEW OF THE HYDE AND WHITE PROPOSALS

I.  THE HYDE PROPOSAL

Representative Hyde is pushing an unconstitutional and overly regulatory 
proposal which would criminalize the transmission and display of 
"indecent material" (a broad classification which includes everything 
from the so-called '7 dirty words' to classic works of fiction such as 
The Catcher In the Rye and Ulysses), hold carriers liable for material 
created by their subscribers, and grant the Federal Government broad new 
authority over online content and the underlying technologies of the 
Internet. The Hyde proposal has been endorsed by the Christian Coalition 
and other members of the "religious-right".

Among other things, the Hyde proposal would:

1. Create $100,000 fines and 2 year jail terms for anyone who makes or 
   makes available any indecent material to a minor (Sec 402 (d)).

2. Grant the FCC broad authority over on line speech and over online 
   technology (Sec (e)(1))

3. Criminalize the transmission or display of indecent material to    
   anyone under 18 years of age (Amendment to 18 USC 1465),

4. Not pre-empt state from passing even more restrictive, or even  
   inconsistent, regulations.

See CDT Policy Post No. 30 (December 1, 1995) for a detailed description 
of the Hyde proposal. For more information, including the text of the 
Hyde proposal and other relevant documents, visit CDT's net-censorship 
issues page (http://www.cdt.org/cda.html)

II.  THE WHITE PROPOSAL

The proposal offered by Representative White, an original co-sponsor of 
the Cox/Wyden/White "Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment" Amendment, 
is based on the user empowerment aspects of the original Cox/Wyden/White 
amendment. 

The White proposal substitutes the narrower "harmful to minors" standard 
for "indecency", and prohibits the FCC from imposing content regulations 
on online speech and from meddling in the underlying technologies of the 
Internet.  While the White proposal does prohibit the "display" of 
material that is harmful to minors online, it creates a defense for 
those who take good faith, reasonable steps, to labile content and 
enable users to block or objectionable material using user control 
technologies (such as SurfWatch, the Parental Control features of AOL or 
Prodigy, or the PICS standards being developed by MIT and the World Wide 
Web Consortium).

Briefly, the White proposal would:

1. Prohibit intentionally sending material that is harmful to minors 
   directly to a to someone the sender knows is a minor,

2. Prohibit the display of material that is harmful to minors. However, 
   content providers (including individual users) would be immune to 
   prosecution if they have taken good faith, reasonable efforts to 
   labile their content and enable it to be blocked or filtered by 
others 
   (The MIT/World Wide Web consortium's PICS would be one example),

3. Prohibit the FCC from regulating content on or the technologies of  
   the Internet and other interactive media, 

4. Pre-empt inconsistent state laws, although this provision would not 
   apply to individuals, non-profit providers of interactive computer 
   services (such as BBS's or freenets), or non-profit organizations.

5. Clarify the House-passed Cox/Wyden/White to ensure that it does 
   inadvertently create loopholes in ECPA or other privacy laws,

6. Protect online service providers from vicarious liability for 
   transmitting their subscribers messages or for merely providing  
   access to the Internet.

III. BACKGROUND ON THE "HARMFUL TO MINORS" STANDARD

White's proposal would prohibit sending material that is "harmful to 
minors" directly to a minor, as well as prohibit the display of material 
that is "harmful to minors" unless good faith, reasonable steps to 
labile and enable others to block access to such material.

Harmful to minors is an intermediate standard between indecency and 
obscenity. It is essentially material that is obscene to a minor. It has 
been used in 48 state statutes and has been ruled constitutional by the 
Supreme Court. It is defined as follows:

"'harmful to minors' means any communications or material that is 
obscene or that:

   (a)  taken as a whole, and with respect to minors, appeals to a 
          prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion;

   (b)  depicts, represents, or describes in a patently offensive way 
        with respect to what is suitable for minors, ultimate sexual 
        acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated, sado-masochistic 
        acts or abuse; or lewd exhibition of the genitals, pubic area, 
        buttocks, or post-putertal female breasts; and

   (c)  taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political,
        or scientific value for minors.

Materials that would be acceptable under this standard include the text 
of Catcher in the Rye, Ulysses, the use of the "7 dirty words" in 
context, and works of art which contain nudity. These same materials 
would be prohibited under an "indecency" standard. 

NEXT STEPS

Once the House conferees vote on Wednesday, the full House/Senate 
conference committee will consider the issue. If the House conferees 
accept the White proposal, there will be additional opportunities to 
clarify and strengthen the proposal. However, if Hyde prevails, the 
entire battle will be lost.

In addition to the "cyberporn issue", there are several other issues in 
the telecommunications bill which the conferees much resolve, including 
competition in the long distance market, cable rate regulation, and 
universal service, to name a few. The Republican leadership has 
reportedly instructed the conferees to finish all remaining issues this 
week and to have the final bill ready for the full House and Senate 
during the week of December 11. It is not clear whether this deadline 
can actually be met given the range of unresolved issues, but the House 
and Senate leadership appear committed to the timeline. 

CDT will keep you informed of developments on this issue as they occur. 
We will also post the text of the White proposal on our net-censorship 
web page as soon as a final copy is available (we expect it to be posted 
by Tuesday afternoon 12/5).

SUBJECT: SENATE PROPOSALS WILL CREATE A NATIONAL IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM
        
The Senate is currently considering proposals to create a national 
database containing personally identifiable information on every 
individual in America.  Recommendations to create a national "worker 
verification" data system are central components of 3 bills currently 
before the Subcommittee on Immigration of the Judiciary Committee:  S. 
269, "The Immigrant Control and Financial Responsibility Act of 1995," 
introduced on January 24, 1995, by Senator Simpson (R-WY), Chairman of 
the Subcommittee, is scheduled for mark-up on June 6th; S. 580, the 
"Illegal Immigration Control and Enforcement Act of 1995," introduced on 
March 21, 1995, by Senator Feinstein; and, S. 754, the "Immigration 
Enforcement Improvements Act of 1995," introduced on May 1, 1995, by 
Senators Kennedy, Simon and Boxer.  

The Center for Democracy and Technology is opposed to the creation of a 
computerized system to verify work eligibility.  Such a system poses a 
substantial threat to privacy and is unlikely to accomplish the goal of 
eliminating the job market for undocumented immigrants.

Leading the opposition to the national identification system proposals 
is a coalition of organizations and individuals, including 
conservative/free market groups, representatives of the business 
community, civil rights organizations and civil liberties organizations.  
The loudest protest against the pending bills has been voiced by the 
conservative and libertarian communities.  

In a speech at the Cato Institute, House Majority Leader Dick Armey 
stated, "I will fight it. . .Any system in which Americans would be 
forced to possess such a card, for any reason, is an abomination and 
wholly at odds with the American tradition of individual freedom."  

The Center for Equal Opportunity and the Alexis de Tocqueville Institute 
are leading the conservative/libertarian outcry.  Stuart Anderson, 
Policy Director at the Alexis de Tocqueville Institute spoke out against 
the proposals in a recent Washington Times editorial, "The federal 
government has never before held detailed information on all Americans 
in one consolidated place accessible to government officials and outside 
entities. . . The IRS, Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, computer 
hackers, even private organizations such as banks, could potentially 
access a national computer database."  

IN AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS, ESTIMATED 
TO COMPRISE 1.5% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION, THE PROPOSALS CAST A 
BUREAUCRATIC NET AROUND 100% OF THE UNITED STATES POPULATION.  

The coalition questions the logic of imposing a multi-billion dollar 
system of increased government bureaucracy upon the daily lives of 
Americans, at a time when less federal power and intrusion is the mantra 
of the day.  As Anderson says, "The price of fake documents and 
acceptable Social Security numbers will likely increase, but there is no 
reason to believe the number of illegal immigrants working here will 
decrease."  In this ill-conceived effort to address the problem of 
undocumented workers, every American worker will be forced to 
participate in an intrusive government system.  This is truly an 
Orwellian nightmare.

Under the guise of reforming immigration policy the bills sponsors are 
asking Congress to authorize the creation of a broad worker verification 
registry that by design must contain information not just on illegal 
immigrants, but on every American and legal immigrant who desires to 
work.  For the first time the federal government has created a detailed 
system of records on individuals that it intends to make accessible to 
the public.  Rather than designing an effective system to manage 
immigration, these bills propose a national database that tramples on 
the civil rights and liberties of every American citizen and resident by 
subjecting each to unwanted and unnecessary invasions of privacy.  

A NATIONAL WORKER VERIFICATION SYSTEM WILL NOT ACCOMPLISH ITS GOAL -- 
ELIMINATING THE JOB MARKET FOR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS -- BUT IT WILL 
INCREASE DISCRIMINATION.  

A worker verification system is an ineffective tool for curbing the job 
market for unauthorized workers, and is very likely to lead to increased 
discrimination and erode individual privacy.  No matter what system or 
card is developed, the black market will continue to meet the demand for 
false documents.  Employers who hire undocumented workers will continue 
to violate the law; they do so intentionally and are unlikely to use a 
verification system.  Instead they will continue to hire undocumented 
workers, while law-abiding employers are subject to new and costly 
government regulation.  During the pilot study of the Telephone 
Verification System the projected costs to employers, for equipment and 
administration, ran between $1,075.00 and $16,155.

THE PROPOSALS WILL LEAD TO THE CREATION OF AN ALL PURPOSE NATIONAL 
IDENTITY DOCUMENT.  

In a "Roll Call" article on May 22, 1995, Senator Feinstein made her 
preference for a single fraud-resistant document clear.  Feinstein 
stated, "I believe that a new, phone or machine-readable card that all 
job and benefits applicants would be required to present . . . deserves 
careful consideration. . . counterfeit-resistant cards that incorporate 
'biometric' data are available and in use today . . . whether the card 
carries a magnetic strip on which the bearer's unique voice, retina 
pattern, or fingerprint is digitally encoded. . . it is clear to me that 
state-of-the-art . . . IDs can and must replace the dinosaur age 
documents now being used."  Although the Senate proposals do not call 
for the creation of a document to verify identity, the very design of a 
vast system of information makes the development of such a document 
inevitable.  At a hearing held by the Subcommittee on Immigration on May 
10, 1995, "Verification of Applicant Identity for Purposes of Employment 
and Public Assistance," it was quite clear that the creation of a 
national identity document is at the core of the "worker verification 
system" proposals.   

The proposals will expand the treasure trove of information accessible 
to the unscrupulous individual who gets hold of another's SSN.  The use 
of the SSN as the "worker verification identifier" will facilitate 
linkage between various systems of governmental and private sector 
records, making the inevitable temptation to use the data base for other 
purposes even stronger.  

The proliferation of the Social Security Number, a number that by law 
was to be used exclusively within the social security system, offers a 
telling example of the Government's inability and unwillingness to limit 
the uses to which such a massive system of identification and tracking 
can be put.  The SSN was created for a limited purpose.  Over the past 
fifty years its use by both the government and private sector has 
proliferated.  The SSN has become a multi-use identifier that can be 
used to link information contained in public and private sector 
databases.  The SSN is a key that unlocks vast storehouses of 
information collected on American citizens, such as credit, health, 
driving and banking records.

AMERICANS WILL BE WRONGLY DENIED JOBS DUE TO INACCURATE DATA.  According 
to a recent GAO report, over 65 million American's change jobs or enter 
the workforce each year.  Even if the system's error rate was reduced to 
1% over 650,000 people would inaccurately be denied the right to work 
each year due to faulty data.  Each Americans' ability to work will be 
dependent on the accuracy of data from the Social Security 
Administration and Immigration and Naturalization Service, both of which 
have been widely criticized for keeping inaccurate records.  The INS 
recently admitted to losing 60,000 files of green-card applicants in 
California and is currently being sued by the American Civil Liberties 
Union.  Current estimates reveal error rates in INS records as high as 
30%.  The Commissioner of Social Security, testifying in 1991 stated, 
"over 60 percent (of the SSNs in use today) are based on the assertions 
a person made at the time he or she applied for a SSN."  According to 
the testimony of Gilbert Fisher, Assistant Deputy Commissioner of SSA 
before the Subcommittee on May 10th, the cost of reissuing the 270 
million cards necessary to address the problem of cards issued without 
proof of identity would cost between 3 and 6 billion dollars.  

In fact, during a recent hearing it became apparent that a bottom line 
figure for the accuracy level to be reached prior to deploying the 
"worker verification system" has not been established or seriously 
considered.  It seems that the supporters of the bills would move 
forward on the "worker verification system" with full knowledge that 
individuals will be unfairly denied employment and benefits due to 
inaccurate data.  Senator Feinstein seems to be the least concerned with 
the loss of employment and benefits by eligible individuals.  In a Roll 
Call article on May 22, 1995, Senator Feinstein advocated moving forward 
immediately without the "pilot" studies and information gathering 
included in the majority of proposals.    

A WORKER REGISTRY WILL BE ABUSED TO DISCRIMINATE AND INVADE PRIVACY.  

The ability of the SSA or other government agency to monitor and control 
access to and use of an information system that is available to both 
agency employees and all potential employers is dubious.  A "worker 
verification system" or national identity document is prone to abuse by 
persons who use it to selectively screen individuals whose appearance, 
surname or accent suggests they are foreign, or to screen such persons 
outside the employment context.  The system or document will place a 
powerful weapon in the hands of those seeking to harass and 
discriminate.  
        
In addition to unauthorized outside use of the system, the creation of a 
worker verification data system will subject individuals to invasions of 
privacy and discrimination from agency employees.  Both the IRS and the 
SSA have recently been subject to criticism for their lack of control 
over agency employees who were both browsing through information for 
their own purposes, and making information available to outsiders for 
monetary compensation.  The openness of the proposed worker verification 
system will make it more difficult to monitor and control the use of 
sensitive personal information and therefore subject individuals to 
greater invasions of personal privacy and discrimination from system 
misuse.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* ANALYSIS OF SELECT SECTIONS OF BILLS:

1. The bills propose to expand the existing Telephone Verification 
   System (TVS) pilot  

The TVS pilot project should not be expanded.  During phase I, nine 
companies participated in a pilot to test the TVS project.  This pilot 
has allowed companies to call the INS and ask for verification that non-
citizens applying for work are eligible for employment.  Both S. 269 and 
S. 754 call for an expansion of TVS.  

Numerous flaws were illuminated during phase I of the TVS pilot which 
counsel strongly against its expansion and undermine its utility.  
First, it relies on "self- attestation" -- those presenting for 
employment must self identify as aliens -- to trigger the system.  
Illegal immigrants can avoid the pilot and never have their eligibility 
to work checked by simply claiming to be a citizen.  Second, during the 
initial pilot, the INS found it was unable to make a determination of 
employment eligibility based on information contained in its 
computerized files 28% of the time, thus the INS had to perform a manual 
search to fulfill 28% of the verification requests.  

2. S. 754 and S. 269 both recommend additional pilots that will improve,
   utilize and link the Social Security Administration (SSA) and
   Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) records and data systems 

S. 754 recommends the establishment of additional pilot projects that 
may include:  a process which allows employers to verify the eligibility 
for employment of new employees using the SSA's records and if 
necessary, to conduct a cross-check using INS records;  a simulated 
linkage of the electronic records of the INS and the SSA; and, 
improvements and additions to the electronic records of the INS and the 
SSA for the purpose of using such records for verification of employment 
eligibility.  (Section 202)  S. 269 directs the Administration to 
conduct demonstration projects in five states to test the feasibility of 
the system.  (Section 112 (a),(b))  

More importantly, Section 113 of S. 269 directs the Attorney General to 
establish a database containing information obtained from the Social 
Security Administration and the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
to be used in determining work authorization for individuals living in 
the United States within one year.  The database may be used in 
conjunction with both the demonstration projects and the final system.  
This new data system will be managed by a new Office of Employment and 
Public Assistance Eligibility Verification.  

The information collected by the Social Security Administration is 
insufficient for establishing identity.  The creation of a national 
identification system run by the SSA, INS or a new agency would require 
a vast increase in data collection on individuals.  For a system to 
accurately establish the identity of individuals it would need to 
contain information as to their identity - name, birth date and 
location, height and weight, for example - citizenship status, and most 
likely a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint.  Such a system 
would provide the government and private institutions with the ability 
to track and profile people from birth to death, creating what Professor 
Arthur Miller termed a "womb-to-tomb" dossier.

Linking information contained in separate databases raises privacy 
concerns.  By allowing government agencies to share information we 
accelerate the creation of a system of national identification, and 
condone the use of information individuals provided to the government 
with the understanding that it would be used for a limited purpose for 
additional purposes without the individual's consent.  

Use of the Social Security Number (SSN) and the underlying SSA database 
to verify the eligibility of individuals to work is impracticable and 
threatens privacy.  Like the INS database, the SSA database is riddled 
with errors.  The SSN was never intended to be relied on by itself as 
foolproof identification.  Historically, SSNs have been easy to obtain 
because there was no need for a secure card for Social Security 
Administration purposes.  

Even with the strictest security measures it is impossible to build an 
impenetrable system.  The database will be a target for computer hackers 
who want information on individuals.  Although both S. 269 and 2. 745 
contain provisions regarding use and protection of the data, the ability 
of the federal government to limit the use of large databases by the 
government and private sector is doubtful.  

The "pilot" programs and "worker verification" system proposed by these 
bills are a huge step toward the establishment of a system of national 
identification and the creation of a national identification document.  
The designation of the projects as "pilots" is misleading.  Under the 
guise of limited "pilot" projects the government is building the basic 
infrastructure necessary to implement a wholesale worker verification 
system.  The language used in the proposals masks the cold fact that 
actual individuals will be denied jobs and benefits, during the "test" 
of these "pilots."  A significant number of denials will be based on 
inaccurate information.  

As the proliferation of the SSN demonstrates, the creation of a national 
database to verify each American's eligibility to enter the work force 
will lead to increased sharing of information, increased demands for 
access for purposes other than the one the system was designed to 
support, and increased demands on individuals by third parties for 
access to this information --  a heavy price to ask all American's to 
pay and one that has not been justified by the problem of illegal 
immigrant workers.  

The "worker verification" system proposals open the door to an Orwellian 
nightmare.  Handing over the civil liberties of 98.5% of the American 
public is not the way to deal with the estimated 1.5% of the population 
that are illegal immigrants.  In the final analysis, the establishment 
of a "worker verification registry," is a solution that threatens to 
create more serious problems than it solves.  Given the tarnished 
history of national identification systems in America and other 
countries, the public distrust of data collection, and the extreme 
threat to civil liberties and civil rights posed by such systems, a 
"worker verification" database should not be adopted as the "quick fix" 
to the problem of undocumented workers.

2) LETTER SENT FROM RIGHT-LEFT COALITION MEMBERS OPPOSING NATIONAL ID
   SYSTEMS.

May 23, 1995

Dear Member of Congress: 
We are writing to express our concern that both Congress and the 
Administration are moving toward the implementation of a national worker 
registry. We believe such a plan put forward in the name of immigration 
control, is both misguided and dangerous for the following reasons: 

It will not work. Those employers who rely on undocumented labor are 
already violating the law; they do so intentionally and are unlikely to 
use a verification system. Instead, they will continue to violate the 
law by hiring undocumented workers while employers who already comply 
with the law are subjected to new, costly requirements for the hiring 
process. 

Faulty data. The data which a nationwide verification system would use 
would rely on two highly flawed data bases, one by the Social Security 
Administration (SSA) and the other the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service (INS~. Both are notorious for containing incorrect or outdated 
information, with error rates as high as 28 percent. Roughly 65 million 
Americans either enter the work force or change jobs every year. Even an 
error rate of no higher than one percent would mean that 650,000 
Americans could be denied jobs every year. 

An unfunded mandate on employers. The creation of a national 
verification system for every workplace in America would present a huge 
administrative burden to the nation's employers, especially small 
business. All employers would be required to ask the federal 
government's permission every time they want to hire somebody. Americans 
want fewer burdensome regulations, not new ones. 

A threat to privacy and civil rights. Worker registry proposals ask 
Congress to create a database of personal information on all Americans 
and make it accessible to all employers. The openness of the proposed 
systems raises barriers to controlling and monitoring the use of 
information. Such systems are prone to abuse by persons who use it to 
selectively screen individuals whose appearance, surname or accent 
suggests they are foreign or to screen such persons outside of the 
context of employment. In addition, government often lacks the political 
will to limit access to information once collected. Indeed, other 
purposes for the data base are already being proposed, including 
verifying eli~ibility for public benefits, tracking childhood 
immunizations, and tracking child support payments. Once a system of 
information on all Arnericans is in place, it will inevitably become 
ubiquitous in American life, presenting an enormous threat to the 
privacy and liberty of Americans. 

We believe it is unwarranted and unwise to create a data system 
involving 100 percent of Americans in an effort to identify the 1.5 
percent who live illegally in the United States. We urge you to oppose 
the creation of a nationwide verification system.

              INTERNET CENSORSHIP BILL

PRESS RELEASE -- For Immediate Release
June 21, 1995
Contact: the Center for Democracy and Technology at +1.202.637.9800


    CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY AND TECHNOLOGY PRAISES SPEAKER GINGRICH'S 
          OPPOSITION TO EXON/COATS INTERNET CENSORSHIP BILL.

In a move that is a boon for freedom of speech rights for Internet users,
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has condemned the Exon/Coats 
"Communications Decency Act" as a "clear violation of free speech 
and ... a violation of the right of adults to communicate with each other."

"Speaker Gingrich has demonstrated that he understands the unique nature of
interactive media such as the Internet," said CDT Executive Director Jerry 
Berman. "Gingrich's leadship on this issue will assure that new interactive 
media will be free to grow without unproductive government intrusion, and that 
the First Amendment rights of users will be protected."

The statement from the Republican leader came on the same day that Rep. Chris 
Cox (R-CA) and Rep. Ron Wyden (D-OR) announced that they are developing a 
different approach to the problem of children's access to controversial 
material on the Internet.  Cox and Wyden say that they seek to encourage 
the development of blocking and filtering technologies that empower parents 
to screen the material to which their children have access.  At the same time, 
they hope to keep the growing Internet free from intrusive and ineffective 
regulation by the Federal Communications Commission.

"Along with the Speaker, Congessmen Cox and Wyden know that federal content 
censorship such as has existed in radio and television mass media will not 
be effective at protecting children," said Daniel Weitzner, CDT Deputy 
Director.  "In the decentralized, global Internet environment, we must rely 
on user control technology to enable users and parents to determine for 
themselves the information that they and their children receive."

The Exon Internet censorship bill was strongly opposed in the Senate by 
Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Senator Russell Feingold (D-WI).  The 
Exon/Coats bill was approved, however, by the Senate last week and is 
still awaiting House action.

Gingrich made his remarks (attached below) last night on a national 
television show, the Progress Report carried on National Empowerment 
Television during a discussion with Rep. Bob Walker (R-PA) and Progress 
and Freedom Foundation Chairman Jay Keyworth.

Gingrich said:

"I think that the Amendment you referred to by Senator Exon in the 
Senate will have no real meaning and have no real impact and in fact 
I don't think will survive. It is clearly a violation of free speech 
and it's a violation of the right of adults to communicate with each 
other. I don't agree with it and I don't think it is a serious way to 
discuss a serious issue, which is, how do you maintain the right of free 
speech for adults while also protecting children in a medium which is 
available to both? That's also frankly a problem with television and radio, 
and it's something that we have to wrestle with in a calm and mature way 
as a society. I think by offering a very badly thought out and not very 
productive amendment, if anything, that put the debate back a step."

values in new computer and communications technologies.

(1) HOUSE CONFEREES APPROVE SWEEPING NET-CENSORSHIP PROPOSAL

House Conferees Approve Sweeping Net-Censorship Proposal

By a razor thin margin, members of the House Conference Committee on
Telecommunications Reform have approved a broad proposal to censor
constitutionally protected speech on the Internet. The provisions adopted
today would make the Internet and Interactive media the most heavily
regulated communicatoins medium in the United States, and severely threaten 
the future of free expression and democratic values in the information age.

The proposal, if agreed to by the full conference committee, would impose
$100,000 fines and prison terms for anyone who posts any "indecent"
material, including the "7 dirty words", the text of classic works of
fiction such as The Catcher In The Rye, or Ulysses, artwork containing
images of nudes, rap lyrics, in a public forum.

CDT strongly opposes the legislation agreed to by the House conferees
today. We believe this proposal threatens the very existence of the
Internet as a means for free expression, education, and political
discourse. The proposal is an unwarranted, unconstitutional intrusion by
the Federal government into the private lives of all Americans.

Indecent material is constitutionally protected speech which the Supreme
Court has ruled can only be restrictive through the "least restrictive
means". Material that has been considered "indecent" has included, among
other things:

* The so-called "7 dirty words"
* The Catcher In The Rye
* Sex and AIDS Education literature
* Photographic, sculpted, and painted images of nudes
* Rap Lyrics

Posting any of the above materials in a public forum would be illegal under
the provision approved today. Although it is unrealistic to expect that
Federal law enforcement has the resources to go after each and every
violation, the threat of $100,000 fines and 2 year prison sentences will
result in a severe chilling effect over all online communications.

CDT will devote all our efforts in the coming weeks to ensure that the full
conference committee does not endorse the approach approved today by the
House. We are also committed to fighting this battle all the way to the
Supreme Court, if necessary, to ensure that these provisions are
overturned.

The text of the proposal will be placed on CDT's net-censorship web page
(URL below) as soon as it's available. CDT will also post a detailed
analysis of the bill soon.

WHITE PROPOSAL ADOPTED, THEN AMENDED TO INCLUDE INDECENCY STANDARD
 2 LIBERAL DEMOCRATS TIP THE SCALES IN FAVOR OF RELIGIOUS-RIGHT

At today's meeting of the House and Senate Conference Committee members,
Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL) offered his proposal to prohibit the transmission
and display of indecent material online, and grant the FCC new authority to
regulate the Internet. As expected, Rep. Rick White (R-WA) offered his
alternative, based on the narrow and constitutional "harmful to minors"
standard and provisions to encourage parental control, not government
censorship. The House conferees then adjourned to a private room, away from
the press and television cameras, to vote.

The Conferees voted 20 - 13 to accept the White proposal. However, Rep.
Goodlatte (R-VA) offered an amendment to substitute "indecency" for the
"harmful to minors" standard in the White proposal. The Goodlatte amendment
was approved on a vote of 17 - 16 and the "harmful to minors" standard was
replaced by the blatantly unconstitutional "indecency standard".
Representative White did NOT vote for the Goodlatte amendment.

Amazingly, two traditionally liberal democrats, Reps. Pat Schroeder (D-CO)
and John Conyers (D-MI) voted for the "indecency" standard! Had either of
these members voted the other way, libraries, schools, and even parents who
allow children to access the text of The Catcher In The Rye online would
not now face $100,000 fines and prison sentences. Schroeder and Conyers
should be ashamed of themselves for not standing up for freedom of speech
and democratic values at such a critical moment, and for assisting the
campaign of religious conservatives to impose their moral values on the
Internet without regard for long-standing constitutional principals.

Representative White should be commended for his efforts to craft a
constitutional proposal which preserved freedom of speech and relied on
user empowerment over government control of online content. He deserves
great credit for his commitment to protecting the Internet and preserving
freedom of speech, and his willingness to stand up to religious
conservatives. Unfortunately, the critical element of his proposal which
made it constitutional was removed over White's objections.

NEXT STEPS

The provision approved today by the committee is similar to the Exon/Coats
CDA in that it relies on the "indecency" standard and contains defenses for
online service providers. The Senate is likely to adopt the proposal with
only minor changes. Senator Exon expressed optimism at today's conference
committee meeting that the issue would be resolved soon, perhaps as early
as Friday.

The Senate conferees are reviewing the language agreed to today by the
House conferees. The House and Senate must each agree on the provisions
before the final bill can be voted on. CDT will keep you informed of
developments on this issue as they occur.

(1) Senator Harkin Amendment Would Expand Law Enforcement Access and Gut 
    Privacy Protections For Telephone Subscriber Information

Yesterday, CDT became aware that Senator Tom Harkin is planning to 
introduce an amendment to the Telecommunications Competition and 
Deregulation Act of 1995 (S. 652) currently being debated on the Senate 
floor. Harkin's proposed amendment would eliminate the Fourth Amendment 
protections currently in 18 USC Sec. 2703 and would give law enforcement 
access to subscriber and customer information on telemarketers from an 
electronic communications service provider with the presentation of a 
mere written notice.  

Harkin's proposal threatens to undermine severely the privacy protections 
on personal information held by communications providers.  If Harkin's 
amendment passes, it would open the door to the future unraveling of this
section which now requires the government to present a court order, warrant, 
or subpoena in order to obtain subscriber information.

The Senate is expected to vote on the Harkin Amendment as early as today. 
CDT urges you to contact Senator Harkin to express your concern about his 
prposal.

(2) Text of CDT/ACLU Letter to Sen. Harkin

June 13, 1995

The Honorable Tom Harkin
United States Senator
SH-531 Hart Senate Office Building
Washington, DC 20510-1502

Dear Senator Harkin:

We are writing to register our strong opposition to your proposed 
amendment to the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 
1995 (S. 652) which would amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2703(c)(1)(B), which 
provides privacy safeguards for telecommunication subscriber information by 
controlling government access.  Under your proposal, law enforcement 
could gain access from a telecommunications service provider to 
subscriber information upon mere submission of a "formal written 
request" where the subscriber is a telemarketer.  This proposal 
represents a severe departure from the strict Fourth Amendment framework 
that governs law enforcement access to personal communications and 
information under Title 18.  Under 2703, law enforcement officers must 
first present a warrant, court order, or administrative subpoena to an 
electronic communications service provider prior to disclosures of 
information about its subscribers.  This section acknowledges the 
important privacy interest people have in the personal information held 
by electronic communications service providers.  Your proposal would 
require information to be provided with fewer privacy protections than 
currently exist even in the case of a foreign counter-intelligence 
investigation.  

The Fourth Amendment privacy protections embodied in Title 18 are 
the product of a long and thorough debate in which the concerns of law 
enforcement and the rights of citizens were aired and carefully 
balanced.  Your proposed amendment would unravel this delicate balance 
without the deliberative process necessary to carve out any exception to 
standard Fourth Amendment protections.

The proposed amendment suggests that the available mechanisms 
offered in Title 18 are inadequate to address the problem of 
telemarketing fraud.  However, there has been no opportunity to create a 
record of the problem or the necessity of amending existing law.  We 
oppose weakening of court order requirements of Title 18.  We do not 
believe that this instance justifies opening the door on eliminating the 
strong Fourth Amendment privacy protections -- rendering other future 
"exceptions" to these privacy protections a virtual certainty.  

We agree, telemarketing fraud is a serious problem and we are 
available to meet with you to discuss means of addressing it.  We 
encourage you to seek hearings on this issue so that a full record is 
developed and appropriate remedies, tailored to the problem, are 
crafted.  However, we must adamantly oppose your proposed amendment to 
the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act.  We look 
forward to working with you.

(3) CDA Update -- SENATE VOTE EXPECTED TODAY OR TOMORROW

The Senate vote on the Communications Decency Act will occurr either today
(6/14) or tomorrow (6/15). Senator Exon has joined forces with Senator
Coats (R-IA), and has introduced a revised Exon/Coats Communications
Decency Act amendment. The text of this proposal was not available for
posting at the time of this writing, but will be made available as soon as
we have it.

The Exon/Coats proposal is reportedly similar to the earlier Exon
proposals, and would severely restrict the free speech and privacy rights
of all Internet users. In addition, the Exon/Coats proposal adds a
provision to ban the dissemination of indecency on all cable channels. This
would ban the showing of popular programs like NYPD Blue, Melrose Place,
educational programing dealing with reproduction, and other programming,
and is a clear violation of longstanding Constitutional precedent.

Senator Leahy plans to offer his alternative (S. 714) during the debate
today, but the outcome at this point is uncertain. Your help is needed now.

CDT is closely following developments on this issue, and will post further
information as soon as it becomes available.

(1) CDT Analysis of Senate Passed Exon/Coats Communications Decency Act

The United States Senate last week approved sweeping Internet censorship 
legislation which dramatically restricts the free flow of information in 
interactive media, and fails to even provide effective protection for 
children from access to inappropriate information.  The Center for 
Democracy and Technology strongly opposes the Exon/Coats Communications 
Decency Act for the following reasons:

* UNCONSTITUTIONAL BAN ON "INDECENT" MATERIAL IN MOST PARTS OF THE 
  INTERNET: The Act imposes criminal penalties of $100,000 fines or up to two 
  years in prison on anyone who "knowingly ... makes or makes available any 
  indecent communications ... to any person under 18 years of age."  This 
  restriction on indecency (a legal term which includes the "seven dirty words" 
  as well as any sexually-explicit material) amounts to a total ban on all 
  "indecent" information in public areas of the Internet, since all users of the 
  Internet know that public areas are accessible to minors.  The United States 
  Supreme Court has held over and over again that indecent material is protected 
  by the First Amendment and may only be regulated with narrowly tailored means 
  that leave adults free to communicate.  Senator Exon's bill has failed to 
  identify Constitutionally-appropriate means of regulation.  As Senator Leahy 
  pointed out during the Senate debate,  the Exon bill would force everyone on 
  the Internet to behave as if there were in "Sunday school."

* SECOND-CLASS FREE SPEECH RIGHTS FOR ALL INTERACTIVE MEDIA:  The  
  Exon/Coats amendment diminishes the First Amendment rights of those who use 
  interactive media as opposed to those who communicate through print.  The  
  indecency ban in Exon/Coats creates the paradoxical result that speech which 
  would be fully-protected in books, magazines, newspapers, or other print-based
  publications, would be subject to criminal sanction if made available 
  over the  Internet. In other words, what is legal in all of the nation's 
  bookstores would become illegal in cyberspace.  

* CRIMINALIZATION OF "ANNOYING" MESSAGES:  Annoying someone using harsh 
  (but not obscene) language over interactive media would become a crime, also
  punishable by $100,000 fines and two year jail terms.  Federal and many state
  laws already criminalize harassment, no matter what the medium, but
  prohibiting mere annoyance is clearly unconstitutional and a wasteful abuse of
  federal power.

* FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION JURISDICTION OVER CONTENT AND 
  TECHNICAL STANDARDS ON THE INTERNET:  Enforcement of the Exon/Coats bill will 
  require extensive an ongoing FCC proceedings to determine what exactly 
  constitutes "indecency" in various interactive media, and how the "safe harbor" 
  defenses in the bill will function.  Such regulation will mean that the FCC 
  intrude on the development of all current and future Internet standards for 
  services such as the World Wide Web, electronic mail, and Usenet newsgroups.  CDT 
  believes that such an FCC role will lead to unnecessary confusion and delay in 
  the growth of the Internet, as well as cast a continual chill over all speech on
  the Internet and other interactive media.

* PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO PROTECT ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM LIABILITY ARE
  INEFFECTIVE:  The "defenses" to prosecution that are intended to 
  protect online services and Internet access providers from liability will 
  create significant risk of criminal liability for all services that provide 
  access to the Internet.  Though Senator Exon may originally promised to exempt 
  these providers from liability, his last-minute compromise with Senator 
  Coats, and failure to understand the basic operation of Internet services, left 
  all Internet access providers at risk of criminal liability for providing 
  access to Usenet newsgroups and other public information services.

* "GOOD FAITH DEFENSE" FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY ENCOURAGE VIOLATIONS OF 
  USER PRIVACY:  Section (f)(4) of Act insulates online service providers 
  from any contractual liability that may arise from their efforts to restrict 
  minors' access to indecent material.  Because of the vaguaries of the 
  Electronic Communications Privacy Act regarding service provider access to 
  subscriber email for "system maintenance purposes," this provision may imunize 
  online service providers who read private messages of their users in  
  circumstances where the provider is acting within the bounds of the Exon/Coats 
  bill.

* UNDUE BURDEN ON INDIVIDUAL USERS, CONTENT PROVIDERS, AND SMALL SYSTEM
  OPERATORS:  Although Senator Exon claims that his bill is only an extension
  of the dial-a-porn law, it is actually far broader.  The dial-a-porn law
  applied only to commercial providers of 900 number services, not every
  telephone customer in the country.  Given the fact that every Internet user is
  both publisher and a receiver of information, Exon's new law, if enacted,
  would create new regulations on the speech of all those who use interactive
  media.

In simple terms, the Communications Decency Act would enshrine in 
statute a sharp distinction between the print medium and new interactive 
media.  For example, though an individual is allowed to go into a 
bookstore and buy a sexually-explicit magazine or a "lewd" work of art, 
one would not be able to access the identical information over the 
Internet.  Both the interactive media and the print media are arenas in 
which individuals and organizations exercise core First Amendment free 
speech rights.  Before Congress elects to diminish the First Amendment 
protections available in this new medium, we believe that careful, 
public consideration is required.

A.  UNCONSTITUTIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON INDECENT SPEECH ONLINE:  BANNING 
    THE"SEVEN DIRTY WORDS" ON THE NET.

If this new proposal became law, the level of discourse on the Internet 
as a whole would have to be reduced to that which is considered 
appropriate for children.  A newly added section (e) effectively makes 
it illegal to use any of the "seven dirty word" in public forums on the 
Internet.  This new subsection makes in a crime to "knowingly" make and 
transmit an indecent message to anyone under 18 years old.  This 
provision covers both private messages between two individuals and 
public postings to newsgroups that may well reach hundreds of thousands 
of people around the world.  Though the drafters may want to limit this 
crime to situations where material is provided directly to minors, that 
is simply impossible on the net.  Anyone who participates in public 
discussion groups knows that there may well be kids reading the group as 
well.  Thus, they would be violating the law simply by posting a hotly-
worded message.

Examples of Prohibited items under the new subsection (e)
    
    Rap music lyrics (both the text and the sound files)
    Lady Chatterly's Lover  
    Public declaration that you're "pissed off" or that someone is a 
   "shit."
    Calvin Klein advertisements (the ones with naked bodies)

The constitutional flaw in this section lies in the critical distinction 
between "obscenity," that which is truly hard-core pornography, and 
"indecency," sexually-explicit material which may be offensive to some 
or may be considered by some to be inappropriate for children, but which 
is protected by the First Amendment.  Under the First Amendment, 
Congress has broad power to ban obscenity, but can only regulate 
indecency in very narrow circumstances, such as in the broadcast media 
where there is a captive audience.  Pacifica Foundation v. FCC (1978) .  
Even in these narrow circumstances, such regulation may be the "least 
intrusive means" for accomplishing the government's goal of protecting 
children.  Sable Communications v. FCC.  Given the existence of software 
and hardware that enable parents to block children's access to indecent 
material the regulation here does not constitute the "least restrictive 
means" requirement set out by the Supreme Court.  

CDT believes that the Act as drafted would not survive a First Amendment 
challenge under the law of Sable because the Senate has altogether 
failed to investigate less restrictive alternatives to meeting its goal 
of protecting children.  The Senate has held no hearings and made no 
legislative findings which support its decision.  During the debate on 
the Senate floor, both Senator Leahy and Senator Feingold offered 
evidence that there are less restrictive alternatives available.  
Neither Senator Exon, Senator Coats, no any other Senator rebutted or 
responded to these assertions.  In light of the overwhelming evidence 
that users and parents can exercise control over what they and their 
children receive over the Internet, a court reviewing the 
constitutionality of the bill, would, we believe, be forced to return 
the matter to Congress for further consideration.

Furthermore, the government may not regulation indecent material in a 
way that would deny adults access to such material.  Butler v. Michigan 
(1957).  This is precisely the result that is produced by this new 
statutory proposal.  Such as result would be both unwise and 
unconstitutional.  The highly restrictive treatment proposed here for 
interactive media creates a situation in the future whereby material 
that is legally available to people of all ages in bookshops and 
libraries will be banned from the Internet.  During the Senate debate, 
Senator Feingold also pointed out that there are many kinds valuable 
information on the Internet that might be considered indecent under FCC 
definitions, such as AIDS education information, various works of art, 
etc.

B. INTRUSION OF THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION ON CONTENT AND 
   STANDARDS IN INTERACTIVE MEDIA

There are "defenses to prosecution" under this statute which are 
designed to limit the liability of service providers and, possibly, 
users and content creators.  (See subsection (f))  To avoid being 
prosecuted under this statute an entity can take "good faith steps" to 
restrict access to the possibly infringing communications and then hope 
that if charged with violating the Act, that the court believes you took 
sufficient steps.  A more prudent person, or a corporation with money 
and reputation at risk, would more likely wait to see what the FCC says 
are sufficient steps to restrict access and follow those regulations.  
Until the FCC acts, the defenses applicable to the dial-a-porn law are 
available, but it is not clear how they would apply to interactive 
media.

If this provision were to become law, an FCC rulemaking will be required 
to decide two issues:

1) what is indecent in interactive media?  

This could include the "seven dirty words", frontal nudity, sound files 
with heavy breathing, or many other examples. However, granting the 
Federal Communications Commission the authority to answer to this 
question would bring the Internet under a similar content regime as 
broadcast television and radio. 

2) what steps must be taken to restrict access to indecent material?

The FCC will also have to decide what techniques must be used to 
restrict access sufficiently to enable users and providers to avoid 
criminal liability. FCC intrusion in the rapidly evolving interactive 
media market promises to delay the development of new technologies, 
squelch the entrepreneurial spirit which has helped the Internet to 
grow, and chill the speech of all users and content creators.  The FCC 
took 8 years to get blocking rules settled just for 900# services, and 
that was one relatively simple technology.  Giving the FCC authority to 
set child-access standards for every piece of the Net, and all new Net 
services that develop is a disaster for the medium and will have a 
sweeping chilling effect on both the technology and free expression 
online.

As Senator Leahy noted during debate on the bill, "the Internet has 
become the tremendous success it is because it did not have Big Brother, 
the Federal Government, trying to micromanage what it does and trying to 
tell users what it could do.  If the Government had been in charge of 
figuring out how to expand the Internet or make it more available and so 
on, I guarantee it would not be one-tenth the success it is today." 
(Cong. Rec. 8344)


C. A NEW CRIME OF ONLINE ANNOYANCE

Senator Exon proposes criminal sanctions for anyone who uses "obscene, 
lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" communications "with intent to 
annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person."  Federal and state 
laws already punish criminal harassment, regardless of the medium used  
to perpetrate the crime.  (See 18 USC 875(c)).  CDT believes that 
additional laws in this area are simply unnecessary.  Moreover, the 
Department has Justice has said that it has adequate prosecutorial 
powers in this new environment. (See DoJ letter June 14, 1995).

D. LIMITATIONS ON SERVICE PROVIDER LIABILITY ARE WEAK AND THREATEN TO 
   RADICALLY REDUCE THE DECENTRALIZED NATURE OF THE INTERNET

Some provisions of the Exon/Coats bill attempt to limit the liability of 
service providers where they act only as passive transmitters of 
content.  However, these provisions have been significantly weakened as 
a result of pressure from anti-pornography groups, and are subject to 
interpretation which creates great risk for both users and service 
providers.  Anti-pornography groups have been pressing to hold online 
providers responsible for all of the information accessible to minors on 
the Internet.  The earlier version of the Exon bill excused from 
criminal liability anyone who had no editorial control over the content 
of the message.  However, the bill passed by the Senate removed the 
"editorial control" defense.  Instead, service providers could limit 
their liability only if they "ha[ve] no control" over the service, or if 
they take steps to restrict access for minors.  The degree of nature or 
degree of control which could leave a provider open to liability is, 
however, not specified.  CDT believes that these weakened "defenses" 
leave access providers, and thus Internet users, in a state of great 
uncertainty as to their responsibility under this bill.  

One of the major criticisms of the original legislation introduced by 
Senator Exon in February 1995 was that it placed criminal liability on 
online service providers and Internet access providers for any content 
that traveled across their networks.  In response to these criticisms, 
Senator Exon altered his bill to assure that service providers would not 
be held responsible for content on their network unless they exercised 
editorial control.  However, in the final days before Senate action on 
the bill, Senator Exon changed the provisions again at the request of 
Senator Coats.  Now, the presumption of liability has been reversed and 
a service provider would have to show that it has no control over the 
service which carried indecent content to a particular minor.

*  THE END OF USENET NEWSGROUPS?

The major uncertainty of the defenses centers on what it means for a 
service provider to have control over indecent or obscene content.  The 
uncertainty of this defense is revealed in an analysis of an Internet 
access providers relationship and potential criminal liability for 
providing access to Internet newsgroups such as Usenet.  Most Internet 
service providers provide access to Usenet, and, generally make choices 
about which newsgroups they carry.  Some carry all newsgroups, others 
carry only some groups.  The architecture of the Internet newsgroup 
system is such that a particular Internet access provide can chose to 
exclude the "alt.sex" newsgroups, or not.  Does this ability to exercise 
control mean that the service provider is criminally liable under the 
statute?  Or, does a carrier have to actually exercise control over the 
content of individual messages?  These definitional questions are legal 
fine points, but create substantial uncertainty over the meaning of the 
Act and are likely to lead to litigation and instability in the Internet 
environment.  Until these issues are resolved, there will likely be a 
substantial chilling effect on all speech on such services. 

The bill and associated legislative history leave some doubt as to the 
meaning of control, since it is never explicitly defined.  Debate on the 
Senate floor, which is often used by courts to divine the legislative 
intent of the drafters where a statute is unclear, gives seemingly 
contradictory signals on the question of service provider liability for 
services such as Usenet newsgroups.  One the one hand Senator Exon says 
in the Congressional Record of the debate that an online provider merely 
providing access, navigational tools and incidental services "is not 
aware of the contents of the  communications and should not be 
responsible" for violation of the obscenity, indecency or harassment 
crimes in the Act.  (Cong. Rec., S8345).  On the other hand, Senator 
Coats, the co-sponsor of the bill, says that the Act "does not create a 
defense for someone who has some level of control over the material of 
the provision of the material."  (Cong. Rec. S8345).  Senator Exon also 
says in the course of this "colloquy" with Senator Coats that those 
"engaging in pornography and indecency should install 'electronic 
bouncers' at their electronic doors" to keep minors out. (Id.)

CDT believes that defenses to prosecution for online service providers 
are critical in the context of this legislation, but is concerned that 
the defenses no longer serve the function for which they were originally 
designed.  As written in the Senate-passed bill, the defenses appear to 
require Internet service providers to interfere with the content of 
messages on their networks if they have any ability to do so.  

*  CREATION OF NEW GATEKEEPERS

Forcing online services providers to exercise control as the new 
Exon/Coats bill seems to require would spell the end of the open, 
decentralized communications environment which has characterized the 
Internet until now.  As we have argued elsewhere, users and parents have 
a great degree of control over what they and their children receive in 
interactive media.  Federal policy should encourage the development of 
this user control potential, rather than return to the centralized 
control regulatory models which characterized the mass media.  As an 
open, decentralized medium, the Internet promotes the free flow of 
information and serves as a valuable political and cultural forum. If we 
rely on user control technology we can protect children without 
involving federal regulators in the censorship of constitutionally-
protected speech.

E. UNFAIR TREATMENT OF INDIVIDUAL USERS, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND 
   OTHER NON-COMMERCIAL SERVICES: PRE-EMPTION AGAINST RESTRICTIVE STATE LAWS 
   ONLY FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES

If enacted, this proposal would protect commercial service providers 
from additional censorship by state legislatures, but leave all non-
commercial users, including libraries, schools, community groups, and 
individuals subject to additional regulation and censorship under state 
law.  The proposal pre-empts state statutes that might censor commercial 
services beyond the scope of federal law, but leaves all other net users 
and groups exposed to any censorship that states may choose to enact.  
We find no valid public policy argument which would accord greater 
protection to commercial speech than is granted to non-commercial users 
of the net.


CONCLUSION: Failure to take full advantage of user and parental control 
features inherent in interactive media

Legislating about new interactive media requires a careful understanding 
of the unique attributes of this new medium.  First and foremost, 
interactive media enable users (including parents) to exercise choice 
over the information that they and their children have access to.  In 
sharp contrast to older media, government content regulation is simply 
not necessary in order to shield children from possibly inappropriate 
information.  Any legislative action in this are must identify ways to 
promote greater parental and user control.  As drafted, the proposal 
before us suggests possible FCC rulemaking on this issue, but is no 
guaranty that the Commission would take this course.  Instead of just 
passing this critical question off to a regulatory body, Congress must 
identify both legal and voluntary means to encourage the development of 
more and more flexible and accessible user control techniques.

Interactive media such as the Internet, commercial online services, and 
interactive television networks, are, by nature, distinctly different 
from traditional broadcast and television mass media.  Interactive media 
does not suffer from a scarcity of capacity, nor does it assault an 
audiance of captive viewers. Most importantly, interactive media offers 
users tremendous control over the content that they and their children 
receive.  The Exon/Coats proposal completely fails to account for these 
unique aspects of interactive media. As House of Representatives begins 
to consider this and other proposals to regulate content on the 
Internet, CDT will continue to fight the Exon/Coats proposal, and will 
work to find alternative prolicy solutions which preserve the First 
Amendment an the free flow of information in cyberspace.

<h2>Expanded Protection for Online Transactional Information</h2>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>Ways may some day be developed by which the 
Government, without removing papers from secret drawers, 
can reproduce them in court, and by which it will be enabled to 
expose to a jury the most intimate occurrences of the home.... 
Can it be that the Constitution affords no protection against 
such invasions of individual security? 1</blockquote>

<h3>I.	Overview</h3>
<p>
<b>A.	Spirit of ECPA calls for expanded protection for network transactional information</b>
<p>
In the eight years since the enactment of ECPA, society's patterns of using 
electronic communication technology have changed dramatically.  Over twenty million people now have electronic mail addresses, numerous business, nonprofit and political groups conduct work over the Internet, and "cyberspace" has become a household world.  Indeed, it is now commonplace to speak about "life online."  Records of all of these activities -- who sends a message to whom, where a given communications device is located, which political party one contacts for information, and which online discussion group or virtual community one associates with -- are available both in real time and in stored form as part of the transactional information generated by advanced computer and communications networks.  With increasing use of telecommunications, this transactional information reveals almost as much about our private lives as would be learned if someone literally followed us around on the street, watching our every move.  
<p>
As the ECPA drafters recognized, "the law must advance with the technology 
to ensure the continued vitality of the Fourth Amendment."2 Under current law, much of this transactional information may be available to law enforcement merely by subpoena which recites that the requested information is "relevant to an ongoing investigation."3 In response to dramatic changes in the way that people use electronic communication services, ECPA should be revised to reflect the increasingly sensitive nature of network transactional information
<p>
<b>B.	Proposal to protect network transactional information that is personally identifiable or that reveals the contents of the communication</b>
<p>	
As this memorandum will demonstrate, the scope and depth of personal, 
sensitive information available through network transactional records has 
increased dramatically since the 1986 law was passed.  Thus, EFF believes that 
the requirements for law enforcement access to certain categories of 
transactional records should be increased from a mere subpoena standard to a 
full "probable cause" warrant requirement.  All transactional records which:
<p><ul>
<li>contain personally identifiable information related to an electronic 
communications, or
<p>
<li>reveal the content of the electronic communication
</ul><p>
should be accessible to law enforcement only with a warrant obtained after 
showing probably cause.
<p>
<p>
<h3>II.	Online transactional information contains extensive personally identifiable information and thus deserves greater protection than telephone toll records</h3>
<p>
<b>A.	Personally identifiable information in online transactional records</b>
<p>
The bulk of email addresses in use today are unique to an individual user.  
Either the address reveals on its face the identity of the user, or a simple 
command can be issued to translate the address into the owner's name.
<p>
<b>Email addresses are personally identifiable</b>
<p>
<pre>jberman@eff.org </pre> belongs to Jerry Berman<br>
<pre>whitfield.diffie@eng.sun.com</pre> belongs to Whitfield Diffie
<p>
Therefore, unlike telephone toll records, a transaction indicating that a message is sent to or received from a particular email address is almost always a definitive record of a communication by an identifiable person.  [For a detailed description of email transactional records, see Appendix A]  Whereas, toll records record only the fact that a given telephone instrument connects an another instrument, a record of an email sent or received will establish the 
identity of the communicating party with some certainty.  Ownership of a 
telephone instruments may be well-established, but without access to the 
content of the telephone communication, there is no proof that any individual was actually using the phone coincident with a communication recorded in toll records.  In practice, courts also agree that toll records fall short of disclosing  identity of the calling parties.4
<p>
Some early email systems tied the email address to a particular computer or 
terminal, just as a  telephone number is tied to a given telephone instrument.  
But today, someone who owns an email address can use it from virtually any 
computer in the world.  Moreover, no one else can easily use another person's email address, since the ability to send and receive mail with an address is generally controlled by password or other security device.  While it is, in some cases, possible to use someone else's email address, this practice will increasingly be considered a fraud on the receiver of the message and a theft of service from the owner of the email account.  By contrast, no fraud is required to use someone else's telephone number, unless one fails to pay the charges associated with the call.
<p>
<b>B.	Transactional records reveal location of sender and recipient</b>
<p>
Transactional information in new mobile communications services such as 
cellular network and Personal Communications Services (PCS) provide law 
enforcement with information about the location and travel of users.  These 
services are designed in order to deliver calls and other communications to the subscriber, no matter where in the country he or she is.  As a side effect of this feature, the network generates trails of transactional information that pinpoint the users location at any time that the user has the device turned on.  For example, when a cellular phone is set to "roam" from one territory to another, it signals the network each time it crosses into a new service area, so that calls can be delivered to that phone and so that proper billing connections are established.
<p>
Furthermore, transactional records from mobile communications services 
will also reveal the movement of an individual from place to place, in real time.  As the target moves from one cell or service area to another, an electronic trace of the fact that a given geographical boundary line is crossed will be created.  If law enforcement has access to such traces, it will be possible to determine not only the targets location, but also his or her direction of movement.
<p>
Such location specific information goes far beyond simple calling and called 
number information contemplated by Congress when it authorized access to 
transactional information without a warrant or other judicial scrutiny.  Where a probable cause warrant has been issued, we do not contest law enforcement's right have access to such information, where technically feasible.  However, we believe that it is contrary to the Fourth Amendment and to the policy framework established in the 1968 Act and ECPA, to allow access to this increasingly rich source of information based on subpoena authority alone.
<p>
<b>C.	Online transactional records deserve a greater degree of protection than telephone toll records</b>
<p>
In contrast to telephone toll records, online transactional information may 
reveal the identity of the communicating parties, and even the precise location of the communicators.  These attributes distinguish online transactional records from traditional telephone toll records and other records generally available to law enforcement under subpoena power.
<p>
<p>
<h3>III.	Content of communication revealed by online transactional 
information</h3>
<p>
In many instances, addressing information from online systems will reveal 
the content or subject of the electronic communication.  As in the example 
below, messages are often directed to, or received from discussion groups on 
particular topics. 
<p>
<b>EMAIL MESSAGE</b>
<pre>
from:       djw@eff.org (Danny Weitzner)
to:         eff-crypto@eff.org,whitfield.diffie@sun.eng.com
subject     crypto policy update
date        July 29, 1994, 08:15:48 EST

This week significant progress was made on the Clipper front, but 
slide continues on export control liberalization...
</pre>
<p>
This message would be sent to everyone who is a participant in this particular 
group.  Discussion groups (such as eff-crypto) are similar to telephone 
conference calls, except that they may last for days, weeks, or years.   [See 
Appendix A for discussion of online transactional records logs which reveal 
such information.]
<p>
Here again, email address records are dramatically more revealing than 
analogous telephone toll records.  Telephone toll records might reveal the fact that the user of a particular telephone was connected to a conference call 
service, but would not indicate the subject of that conference.  In the email 
example, above, the subject of the conference is embedded into the address 
line, along with other individual addressed.  Furthermore, since the conference name is indistinguishable from an individual email address, there is no way to segregate such information out of the transactional record stream.
<p>
<b>B.	Freedom of association and assembly implicated by disclosure of personally identifiable information</b>
<p>
Not only does the transactional log of such a discussion group reveal the 
contents of the discussion, but also, the names of the parties to the discussion 
are disclosed in the logs.  This as an excerpt from an actual email log which 
records the progress of the above from the sender to all of the members of the 
online discussion group.
<p>
<pre>
01 7/29  08:15:48	  IIA12559:	from=<djw@eff.org>, msgid=<199407291215.IIA12559@eff.org>

09 7/29  08:15:51	  IIA12565:	to=djw@eff.org (Danny Weitzner), delay=00:00:01, stat=queued

</pre>
First, line 1 of the log reveals that a message was sent to the eff-crypto 
discussion group.  Then, lines 5 through 9 reveal the identity of all of the 
recipients of that message, in other words, all of the participants in this particular group.
<p>
For those who associate and assemble online, these email logs are 
equivalent to membership lists deserving of constitutional privacy protection.  Inasmuch as online transactional records reveal the identity of the parties who are engaged in the discussion, fundamental constitutional rights such as freedom of association and freedom of assembly are implicated by any disclosure to the government.  Since NAACP v, Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 US 449 (1958), courts have agreed that threats to privacy of association constitute impermissible intrusion on First Amendment freedom of association and freedom of assembly.  The NAACP case involved a challenge to a government action which would have compelled the NAACP to disclose its membership list to the State of Alabama.  The Supreme Court found that:
<p>
Inviolability of privacy in group association may, in many circumstances, be 
indispensable to preservation of freedom of association.  Id. at 462.
<p>
Inasmuch as online transactional records reveal such group association, they 
should be given a high level of protection from government intrusion.  The 
transactional records of online conferences discussed above and in shown in 
Appendix A, clearly reveal association with particular groups.
<p>
<p>
<h3>IV.	Quantity, Detail, and Ease of Analysis of transactional records require expanded protection</h3>
<p>
With the passage of ECPA , electronic mail messages were given the same 
degree of privacy protection as first class mail.  Notwithstanding the analogy 
drawn in 1986, there are significant differences between email addressing logs 
and information which may be obtained under a mail cover.
<p>
<b>A.	Transactional logs of email contain significantly more information than available from a mail cover</b>
<p><ul>
<li> Automatic email transaction trail
</ul><p>
Email systems create detailed transaction logs as a matter of course, 
whereas the postal service only keeps address logs if specifically required to do 
so by valid legal process.  Thus, in the case of email surveillance, law 
enforcement may decide after the fact of a particular transmission, to seek 
access to transactional records.
<p><ul>
<li>Automatic attachment of return address information</ul>
<p>
When using US Postal Service mail, the addition of a return address which 
identifies the sender is entirely optional and requires an affirmative step by the sender.  In contrast, most email systems automatically append a return address to each electronic mail message, thus guarantying that anyone who examines the email log, will be able to identify both the sender and recipient.
<p>
<ul><li>Email co-mingles functions traditionally accomplished with voice, fax, paper mail, and even face-to-face communications</ul>
<p>
Email communication is often a substitute for many other forms of 
communications.  An email message can replace a fax, a voice telephone call, 
a short note sent through the US mail, and even face-to-face communication.  
Therefore access to logs of such communication is vastly more revealing than a log of any other single form of communication.  Courts have recognized an 
increased privacy interest in co-mingled information as compared to the same information in disaggregated form.
<p>
<b>B.	Increased privacy interest in compilations</b>
<p>
The volume and detailed nature of email transactions raise much more 
serious privacy concerns than do either toll records or mail cover logs.  The 
Supreme Court and the US Congress have recognized that computerized 
compilations of information raise unique privacy concerns.  Beginning with the Privacy Act of 1974, Congress has acknowledged that "computerized data 
banks ... present issues considerably more difficult than, and certainly very 
different from, a case involving the source records themselves."5  Later, in 
Whalen v. Roe, the Supreme Court found that "[t]he central storage and easy 
accessibility of computerized data vastly increase the potential for abuse of that information."6  And finally, in US Department of Justice v. Reporter's Committee, the Court found that a "strong privacy interest inheres in the nondisclosure of compiled computerized information...."7   It is precisely the great volume of and easy access to transactional information which raises an increased privacy interest in these records.
<p>
<h3>V.	Extend the spirit of ECPA to cyberspace:  Need to update ECPA protections for transactional information in the changing digital world</h3>
<p>
The guiding principle of ECPA was that new privacy protection should be 
extended to electronic communications, so that user of new communications 
technology would have confidence that their communications were free from 
unwarranted private or government intrusion.  With the qualitative shift in 
communications activity that has occurred over the last decade, it is time to 
extend greater protection to the transactional information that records people 
activities online.
<p>
<b>A.	Gaps left by 1986 law -- Unclear definition of transactional records</b>
<p>
The main focus of ECPA was to offer clear privacy protection for the contents 
of electronic communication despite the fact that the communication is handed over to a third party, namely the electronic communication serviceprovider.8   However, little consideration was given at the time to the proper treatment of transactional records.  The records are mentioned in the statute, but not given any definition.  The committee report from the Senate does offer brief discussion of the nature of these records, but focuses primarily on customer lists and telephone toll records.9   The House report recognizes that electronic communications services create records that do not conform to legal categories for older technologies:
<p>
The newer technologies such as electronic mail and remote computing 
services maintain a type of records which do not neatly fit within the legal 
categories which exist for older technologies.10
<p>
However, no where in either committee report is the issue of access to email 
transactional records discussed  for the purposes of establishing the 
appropriate standard for government access.
<p>
<b>B.	Extension of protection is consistent with the spirit of ECPA and the expressed intend of the drafters</b>
<p>
In the spirit of ECPA, we should recognize that it is again time to extend 
privacy protection to the personally identifiable transactional information that is, in may cases, indistinguishable from content.11  The drafters did not intend that electronic communication service providers should not disclose "profiles" of users that were related to the contents of the communication.12  Furthermore, discussions of transactional records was limited at the time to telephone toll records and other customer account billing and demographic information.13
<p>
<p>
<h3>VI. Conclusion</h3>
<p>
This memo has shown that:
<p><ul>
<li>transactional records now reveal the content of communication,
<li>these records contain personally identifiable information,
<li>disclosure of such records implicate fundamental privacy and free 
association rights,
<li>current law is unclear as to the definition of such records, and,
<li>increased protection for transactional records is consistent with the spirit of the 1968 Act and the 1986 Act.
</ul><p>
Attached is proposed statutory language which would amend the stored 
communications section of ECPA to provide a higher level of protection for 
sensitive transactional records.  The amendments would leave intact law 
enforcement's current authority regarding telephone toll records and basic 
billing information such as subscriber billing address and service 
arrangements.  These changes to current law are necessary to provide 
assurances to users of new communication technology that their private 
activities in the online world are free from unwarranted interference.

<h3>Telephone Toll Records and Electronic Mail Logs</h3>
<p>
<p>
The most significant difference between a telephone toll record and an 
electronic mail log is that electronic mail addresses are unique to individual 
users.  Unlike a telephone number, which corresponds only to a specific 
location (such as a home or business address), most electronic mail addresses 
are linked by a secret and unique password14 to an individual regardless of 
physical location.  Thus, while a record indicating that a certain telephone 
number was dialed from another telephone number indicates that a transaction occured, an electronic mail record indicates that a specific and unique individual has communicated with another individual or group of individuals.
<p>
<b>Telephone Toll Records</b>

These records indicate the date, number dialed, its location, time, and duration of calls made from 202 483-5429, which is billed to Jonah Seiger. These records do not indicate that Jonah Seiger himself actually placed the calls, the identity of the recipients, or the nature of the communication (i.e, voice, modem, fax, etc).
<p>
<b>Electronic Mail Logs </b>
<p>
The table below represents actual electronic mail logs from the Electronic Frontier Foundation's electronic mail server.  These logs indicate a message sent by an individual user (in this case, djw@eff.org) to members of an online discussion titled (eff-crypto) (EFF's online forum on issues relating tocryptography and digital privacy in general).  Although this example contains addresses unique to EFF, virtually all electronic mail software logs transactions in an identical way.  In the course of accounting and processing electronic mail messages, the mail server assigns each message a unique message ID number.  By tracking a message ID number, one can 
easily know who sent a message, and to whom that message was sent. (For ease of reading, line numbers have been added).

<b>Comparison of Telephone Toll Records and Electronic Mail Logs</b>
<p>
From these two examples, it is clear that electronic mail logs reveal a great 
deal more about both the destination and substance of a communication than 
does a telephone toll record.  While the telephone toll record does show that a specific number was dialed at a certain time, it reveals nothing else about the nature of the communication, or the identity of the sender or the recipient. There is nothing inherent in a toll record to indicate that a specific individual communicated with another.  In the example above, we only know that 202 483-4529 dialed 313 555-4545 on a certain date and time.
<p>
In contrast, because each electronic mail address is linked directly to an 
individual with a password unique to that address, a record of a communication in this medium indicates the occurrence of a communication between two specific individuals.  Moreover, in the example above, the log reveals that an individual communicated with a group of individuals who belong to a subject specific group (in this case eff-crypto).  Through a simple analysis of message identification numbers, one can very easily track the communications of one person, and know with certainty with whom that person is communicating.

<h3>File Transfer and Retrieval Logs</h3>
<p>
<p>
<b>Tracing a File Directly to an Individual</b>
<p>
Virtually all online information services, such as America On Line (AOL), 
Prodigy, Compuserve, and the Internet, contain a wealth of files and information in areas known as "file archives".  There are many thousands of archives throughout cyberspace, containing files ranging from political information (e.g.: White House press releases, legislation, policy statements, etc.), shareware (free, public domain software), to images from the Hubble Space Telescope.  Users can access file archives through a variety of ways depending on the service they subscribe to.   
<p>
For purposes of maintenance, accounting and security, most online services 
keep records of all transactions involving file transfer and retrieval.  Through a simple analysis of these records, one can easily trace a file directly to an 
individual user.
<p>
The example to follow will illustrate how such a trace can be accomplished 
using transactional records from the Internet File Transfer Protocol (ftp), the 
primary method for transferring and retrieving files over the Internet.  FTP 
provides any Internet user with the ability to retrieve files from any computer on the network.   Files available via ftp are stored in 'ftp archives' which can be accessed by a user through the execution of a few relatively simple commands. <B>[EDITORS NOTE: This document was originally written in July 1994, before the explosion of the World Wide Web. File transfers over the World Wide web are essentially the same as FTP transfers, raising the same issues identified here].</B> 
<p>
Every user on online networks is identified by an electronic identity, usually identical to their electronic mail (email) addresses.  Individuals control access to their email addresses through a secret personal password.  Because email 
addresses are tied to individual users, and because ftp logs indicate that a 
specific file has been retrieved, a simple analysis of ftp logs can easily reveal 
that an individual has retrieved a specific file.
<p>
<b>FTP Transaction logs</b>
<p>
This example will trace an individual user's retrieval of a file from the online 
archives of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).  The file, named 
'digitel.faq', contains answers to frequently asked questions about the Digital 
Telephony legislation.   The records below are actual records from EFF's ftp 
archive (named <b>ftp.eff.org</b>) and main computer (<b>eff.org</b>)
<p>
All computers connected to the Internet have names.  In this example, it is 
important to note that <b>ftp.eff.org</b> and <b>eff.org</b> are two distinct computers.  The computer <b>ftp.eff.org</b> keeps separate records from the computer <b>eff.org</b>.  Furthermore, each authorized user has a unique electronic identity, usually same as that individual's electronic mail address (e.g.: brown@eff.org is the user Dan Brown [EFF's system administrator]).  A simple correlation of the timestamps on the transactions between the two computers will reveal that Dan Brown retrieved the file 'digitel.faq'. 
<p>
<p>
<h3>I.	Dan Brown Logs Onto <b>eff.org</b></h3>
<p.
By examining the logs of the computer eff.org, we can determine when a 
specific individual logged onto and off of the network.  This record is displayed below:
<p>
<pre>
#  User  Terminal	  Remote machine	Timestamps

05 brown   ttyp0	  elec.eff.org	Fri Jul 29 12:59:04 - 13:03:14 

</pre>
Because the user 'brown' is linked to Dan Brown through a unique personal 
password, this record indicates that Dan Brown was logged onto <b>eff.org</b> on Friday July 29 between 12:59 and 13:03.
<p>
<h3>II.	Dan Brown Executes a File Transfer (ftp)</h3>
<p>
By examining the logs which record the programs run by users on <b>eff.org</b>, and noting the times at which those programs were run, we can determine when Dan Brown executed a file retrieval program (ftp).   This record is displayed below (printed on July 29 at 13:15):
<p>
<pre>
#  program   user name	  terminal	  start time   	end time

08 ftp	   brown	  ttyp0	  13:00:21	      13:01:20

</pre>
Note that the start and end times correspond to the period of time Dan was 
logged onto <b>eff.org</b>.  This record clearly shows that Dan Brown ran the file retrieval program (ftp) between 13:00:21 and 13:01:20.
<p>
<h3>III.	Logs from the File Archive Show a File Transfer </h3>
<p>
We now turn our analysis to the records of the computer containing EFF's 
online file archives (the computer named <b>ftp.eff.org</b>).  Again, a simple check of timestamps reveals that a user from <b>eff.org</b> made a connection using the file transfer program (ftp).  These records are displayed below:
<p>
<pre>
#  Timestamp	  Hostname	   Process ID	Message
		
04 Jul 29 13:00:21  ftp.eff.org  in.ftpd[5458]: connect from brown@eff.org
	
12 Jul 29 13:01:20  ftp.eff.org  ftpd[5458]:    FTP session closed

</pre>
Note the direct correlation between the times indicated above and the times 
indicated on the previous two logs.  This log shows that the file transfer program run by Dan Brown was executed on the computer <b>ftp.eff.org</b>, indicating that Dan Brown retrieved a file from EFF's online file archive.  
<p>
<h3>IV.  Logs from the File Archive Name the File Transferred to Dan 
Brown</h3>
<p>
One final check of the logs from EFF's online archive show which file Dan 
transferred to his own computer.  We already know that Dan was logged onto 
the network between 12:59:03 and 13:03:14.  We also know that he ran the file 
transfer program between 13:00:21 and 13:01:20.  This has been confirmed by 
logs from two separate computers.  By examining one additional log on the 
computer containing EFF's online file archive (<b>ftp.eff.org</b>), we can see which particular file Dan retrieved.  This log is displayed below:
<p>
<pre>
Fri Jul 29 13:01:18 1994 1  				

eff.org	67773  /pub/EFF/Policy/Digital_Telephony/digitel.faq

</pre>
This log shows that the file 'digitel.faq' was retrieved at 13:01:18 by a user 
logged onto the computer <b>eff.org</b>.  Note that the exact time of the file retrieval corresponds to the time that Dan Brown was running the file retrieval program (as indicated on the logs described previously).
<p>
We have seen that Dan Brown was running the file retrieval program 
between 13:00:21 and 13:01:20.  This is confirmed on the logs from both the 
computer Dan was logged onto (<b>eff.org</b>) as well as the computer containing the online file archive (<b>ftp.eff.org</b>).  Because the logs also show that the only user running the file transfer program at that time was Dan Brown, we have now confirmed that Dan Brown retrieved the file 'digitel.faq'. 
<p>
<b>FTP Logs Reveal the Actions of an Individual User and the 
Contents of those Transactions</b>
<p>
Detailed transactional information from online information services enables 
anyone with access to these records to reconstruct a detailed picture of a user's 
actions.  In this case, the logs show which document the user accessed. 
Because all users on the Internet and other online services are linked to their 
electronic identities by a unique password, transactional records which reveal 
the electronic identity of a user correspond directly with that individual.  The 
electronic identity (brown@eff.org) is always Dan Brown.  In the case of this 
example, transactional records reveal that Dan retrieved the file 'digitel.faq' 
from the online archives of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
<p>
Transactions similar to the one illustrated here occur millions of times each 
day on computer networks throughout the United States.  Furthermore, because computer logs record each and every transaction, it is not difficult to track the actions of any individual using an online service simply by examining such logs.  
<p>
This type of detailed transactional information is not unique to Internet ftp 
sessions.  It is captured in similar forms on computers throughout the online 
service world.  Every time a user logs on to an online service, sends electronic 
mail, retrieves a file, or joins a discussion group, detailed information is 
collected in the normal course of completing these transactions.  And, since 
virtually all users of online services are personally linked to their electronic 
identities by a unique password, all of these transactional records point directly to the actions of individual people.

11 Curiously, the original language in Title III, before it was amended by ECPA, provided that the "contents" of a communication included the "identity of the parties to such communication or the existence, substance, purport, or meaning of the communication."  Thus, in 1968, telephone toll records were accessible under a lower standard precisely because they did not reveal the identity of communicating parties or the existence of the communication.  Any transactional information which reveals the 
identity of the parties, or the content of the communication, should therefore be accessible to law enforcement only through a probably cause warrant. <p>

14 All commercial on line services (AOL, Compuserve, Prodigy, etc), as well as most Internet providers require users to enter a password each time they log onto the service.  Passwords are unique to each individual (similar to a PIN number used for cash machines at Banks), and in most cases the practice of using another persons password without permission is considered a breach of contract or user agreement. <p>

15 The dialed numbers have been changed .  The information described above has been certified by Bell Atlantic to be identical to information obtainable by law enforcement officers with proper subpoena authorization.  Records indicate long distance toll calls.  According to Bell Atlantic, only long distance dialed number records are collected.  Law enforcement must use pen register or trap and trace devices to capture local dialed number records.<p>

(1) FBI NOTICE BEGINS DIGITAL TELEPHONY COMPLIANCE PROCESS -- PUBLIC 
    ACCOUNTABILITY FOR FBI REQUEST ESSENTIAL

On Monday October 16 1995, the FBI published its initial request for 
surveillance capacity as required under Section 104 (a) of the 
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (PL 104-144, a.k.a. 
Digital Telephony).  As required by law, the FBI will accept public 
comments on the proposed capacity requirements for 30 days (ending November 
15, 1995).  The notice, which includes instructions for submitting 
comments, is attached below.

CDT is in the process of examining the proposed notice, and will issue 
formal comments in the next several weeks.  We are evaluating the notice 
with the following criteria in mind:

* Has the FBI met all the public accountability and oversight criteria
  required by the statute?

* What is the impact of the proposed notice on the privacy of individual 
  telephone subscribers and the security of telecommunications networks?

* Does the requested capacity accurately reflect the needs of law 
  enforcement? 

* The capacity requests are based on an FBI survey of recent surveillance  
  activity. Is the factual justification for the FBI request sufficiently 
  detailed to facilitate a substantial public discussion about the 
  reasonableness of the needs?

* Does the FBI expect telecommunications carriers to comply with the 
  capacity requests if Congress fails to appropriate funds for 
  reimbursement?

CDT plans to meet with the FBI to discuss the proposed notice. CDT will 
also work both on our own and through the Digital Privacy and Security 
Working Group (DPSWG, a coalition of over 50 public interest groups, 
telecommunications carriers, manufacturers, trade associations, coordinated 
by CDT), and with members of Congress to ensure that the reporting 
requirements and public accountability provisions of the law are enforced 
and that law enforcement provides the necessary accounting of its 
capability requests.

CDT stands ready to intervene as necessary before Congress, the Federal 
Communications Commission, the telecommunications industry standards bodies 
charged with setting technical standards for implementing the requirements, 
and at other points necessary to ensure that privacy is protected and the 
public accountability provisions are strictly enforced.  We will continue 
to update you on developments on this issue as they occur. 
________________________________________________________________________

BACKGROUND -- PUBLIC OVERSIGHT REQUIREMENTS IN THE DIGITAL TELEPHONY LAW

The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) requires 
telecommunications carriers to ensure that their systems contain sufficient 
capability and capacity to permit law enforcement to conduct authorized 
electronic surveillance. However, the requirements of the statute do not 
apply to the Internet, commercial online services (such as America Online, 
Prodigy, or Compuserve), or BBS's.

The statute also contains specific new statutory privacy protections for 
transactional records generated by online electronic communications 
services, greater protection for cordless telephones, and prohibitions on 
pen register authority to gather location information ('pen registers' are 
devices used to gather dialed numbers).  Furthermore, the statute contains 
provisions which require public accountability and oversight over law 
enforcement surveillance capacity requests, telecommunications carrier 
liability, standards setting, and cost reimbursement.

Although law enforcement officials must still obtain a search warrant in 
order to conduct a wiretap, the statute granted law enforcement new 
authority to influence the design of telecommunications networks.  This 
authority must be closely monitored through the law's public accountability 
and oversight provisions to ensure that law enforcement does not over-reach 
or abuse the powers granted under the statute.

The statute separates compliance into two categories: 

* CAPACITY (The subject of the current notice): The ability of a 
  telecommunications network to accommodate a specified number of 
  intercepts, pen register, and trap and trace devices; and

* CAPABILITY: Functional requirements to ensure that a telecommunications 
  network can enable law enforcement to conduct electronic surveillance.

Below is a basic overview of the compliance processes for both the capacity 
and capability requirements of the Digital Telephony law, along with a 
description of the proposed notice.  A more detailed explanation of the 
compliance process, as well as the privacy and public accountability 
provisions can be found on CDT's Digital Telephony Web Page 
(URL:http://www.cdt.org/digtel.html)
_______________________________________________________________________

SURVEILLANCE CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS

Section 104 of CALEA requires telecommunications carriers to ensure that 
their systems posses sufficient capacity to accommodate a specified number 
of simultaneous intercepts, pen register, and trap and trace devices.  As 
required by Section 104 (a)(1), the FBI, after consultation with state and 
local law enforcement officials and the telecommunications industry, has 
published an initial notice or capacity requirements.  Section 104 (a)(1) 
requires that the FBI seek public comment and then publish in the federal 
register and provide to telecommunications carriers:

1. NOTICE OF ACTUAL CAPACITY: The actual number of simultaneousintercepts, 
   pen registers, and trap and trace devices that will be necessary 4 years 
   from the date of enactment (October 25, 1998) (Sec 104 (a)(1)(A); and

2. NOTICE OF MAXIMUM CAPACITY: The maximum capacity required to accommodate 
   all intercepts, pen registers, and trap and trace devices that the 
   Attorney General estimates government agencies will be authorized to 
   conduct simultaneously after the date 4 years after enactment (Sec 104    
   (a)(1)(B)).

Carriers then have 180 days to identify which aspects of their networks are 
not compliant with the published capacity requirements.  Section 104 (e) 
requires the government to reimburse telecommunications carriers for all 
reasonable costs associated with capacity upgrades.  If the government 
fails to reimburse a carrier, that carrier will not have to modify any 
feature or service.  This provision is intended to ensure that the 
government prioritizes capacity requests and does not demand unnecessary 
surveillance capability financed by hidden charges to subscribers.
_______________________________________________________________________

PROPOSED CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS

Throughout the past year, the FBI, through its Telecommunications Industry 
Liaison Unit (TILU) developed a "baseline of electronic surveillance 
activity" by compiling  information from telecommunications carriers, law 
enforcement, U.S. District Courts, State Attorney's General, and State 
District Attorneys. 

From this information, the FBI derived the total simultaneous electronic 
surveillance activity by switch and geographic area.  Future capacity needs 
were determined by considering the impact of demographics, market trends, 
and "other factors" [page 53645, see below] (Section 104 (a)(2) gives the 
FBI broad latitude in determining the basis of capacity needs). 
 
As described above, the capacity requests include both "actual capacity" 
(which must be in place within 4 years), and "maximum capacity" (which must 
be in place after 1998). The FBI has proposed to create three categories of 
capacity requirements based on the projected number of simultaneous 
surveillance orders in geographic areas.  Requirements are based on what 
the FBI refers to as the "engineered capacity" of each switch, feature, or 
service in a specific geographic region [page 53646, see below]. 

Although we contacted several telecommunications carriers, CDT has not yet 
been able to determine precisely what "engineered capacity" corresponds to.  
According to the FBI notice, engineered capacity refers to the maximum 
number of subscribers that can be served by a particular equipment, 
facility, or service.  For the purposes of the descriptions below, we 
assume that the average number of subscribers is equal to 100,000 for each 
facility, equipment, or service deployed on a telecommunications carrier's 
network.  Of course, it could be far more or less depending on the actual 
definition of the term and the number of subscribers per equipment, 
facility, or service.         

CATEGORY III -- Baseline Surveillance Capacity

According to the notice, all telecommunications carriers would be required 
to meet the Category III requirements.  The FBI estimates that roughly 75% 
of the U.S. would be covered by this category [page 53646, see below]. 

ACTUAL CAPACITY: .05% of engineered capacity, or 50 simultaneous 
surveillance orders for each equipment, facility, or service serving 
100,000 subscribers.

MAXIMUM CAPACITY: .25% of engineered capacity, or 250 simultaneous 
surveillance orders for each equipment, facility, or service serving 
100,000 subscribers, by 1998.

CATEGORY II --  Areas With Moderate Surveillance Activity

Carriers in geographic areas which the FBI estimates require higher than 
average surveillance capacity, including large suburban areas and some 
urban areas will be required to meet Category II and Category I 
requirements.  The FBI estimates that roughly 25% of the U.S. will be 
covered by Category II and Category I [page 53646, see below]. 

ACTUAL CAPACITY: .25% of engineered capacity, or 250 simultaneous 
surveillance orders for each equipment, facility, or service serving 
100,000 subscribers.

MAXIMUM CAPACITY: .5% of engineered capacity, or 500 simultaneous 
surveillance orders for each equipment, facility, or service serving 
100,000 subscribers, by 1998.

CATEGORY I -- Areas With Heavy Surveillance Activity

Large urban areas and other areas the FBI estimates require the greatest 
surveillance capacity would fall under Category I [page 53646, see below]. 

ACTUAL CAPACITY: .5% of engineered capacity, or 500 simultaneous 
surveillance orders for each equipment, facility, or service serving 
100,000 subscribers.

MAXIMUM CAPACITY: 1% of engineered capacity, or 1000 simultaneous 
surveillance orders for each equipment, facility, or service serving 
100,000 subscribers, by 1998.
_______________________________________________________________________

SURVEILLANCE CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS

In addition to specific capability requirements, the Digital Telephony 
statute requires telecommunications carriers to ensure that they possess 
sufficient capability to enable law enforcement, pursuant to proper legal 
authorization, to (Section 103):

1. expeditiously isolate and intercept all wire and electronic 
   communications within a carrier's network;
 
2. expeditiously isolate and enable the government to access call
   identifying information;

3. deliver intercepted communications and call-identifying information to a
   location specified by the government (but only with the affirmative 
   intervention of the telecommunications carrier).  Remote monitoring is 
   explicitly prohibited; 

4. to meet these requirements in a way that protects the privacy and 
   security of communications and call-identifying information not 
   authorized to be intercepted.
_______________________________________________________________________

PROCESS FOR DETERMINING AND MEETING CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS

The process for determining and meeting capability requirements (outlined 
in Sections 103 and 107 of the statute) is separate and distinct from the 
process for determining capacity requirements.

The CALEA requires law enforcement determine the specific capabilities it 
needs, and consult with appropriate telecommunications trade associations, 
standards setting bodies, representatives of users of telecommunications 
equipment, and State utility commissioners in order to determine what 
specific changes are required to meet the capability requirements (Sec 107 
(a)).  

The telecommunications industry, through standards-setting bodies, is 
charged with developing technical standards to meet the capability 
requirements (the statute explicitly prohibits the government from imposing 
any technical standards on the telecommunications industry). Finally, the 
standards can be challenged before the FCC if any person believes they do 
not adequately protect privacy or fail to meet other requirements (Sec. 107 
(e)).  Carriers are responsible for meeting the capability requirements by 
October 1998.

The FBI is currently in the process of determining its specific capability 
needs 
_______________________________________________________________________

NEXT STEPS

When Congress passed the Digital Telephony bill last year, it 
simultaneously authorized, but did not appropriate, $500 million to 
reimburse telecommunications carriers capacity upgrades and capability 
upgrades where compliance is not 'reasonably achievable (Sec 109 (b)).  If 
Congress fails to appropriate funds to cover reimbursement, 
telecommunications carriers will not be obligated to comply with the 
requirements of the statute.

The Administration has requested to fund the program through a 30-percent 
surcharge on civil monetary penalties and criminal fines at a level of $100 
million dollars for fiscal year 1996.  The request is currently part of the 
stalled anti-terrorism legislation.  However, the FBI expects that funds 
will be appropriated as part of the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations 
bill, which is currently pending before the Congress.

CDT believes that no funds should be appropriated or spent to fund the 
implementation of the Digital Telephony law unless and until law 
enforcement demonstrates it has met the public accountability and oversight 
provisions. CDT is committed to working with the telecommunications 
industry, Congress, and the FBI to ensure that this requirement is met.

(1) Public Interest/Industry Coalition Says Administration Crypto Policy 
    Flawed -- Pledges to Develop Alternative

A broad coalition of nearly forty public-interest organizations, trade 
associations, and representatives from the telecommunications and 
computer hardware and software industries sent the attached letter to 
Vice President Albert Gore on Wednesday, objecting to the 
Administration's recently announced cryptography policy. 

While the letter praised the administration for its efforts to develop a 
national cryptography policy, the signatories, which include groups such 
as EFF and companies such as America Online, Apple, AT&T, MCI, Lotus, 
Microsoft, and Tandem Computer (organized by CDT), expressed concern 
that the Administration's proposal is weighed heavily in favor of law 
enforcement and national security while neglecting the privacy and 
security needs of individuals and the marketplace. 

The letter states:

 "A secure, private, and trusted Global Information Infrastructure 
  (GII) is essential to promote economic growth and meet the needs of 
  the Information Age society.  Competitive businesses need cryptography 
  to protect proprietary information as it flows across increasingly 
  vulnerable global networks. Individuals require privacy protection in 
  order to build the confidence necessary to use the GII for personal 
and 
  financial transactions... The undersigned groups recognize that 
  the Administration's recently articulated cryptography initiative was 
a 
  serious attempt to meet some of these challenges, but the proposed 
  initiative is no substitute for a comprehensive national cryptography 
  policy.  To the extent that the current policy becomes a substitute 
for 
  a more comprehensive policy, the initiative actually risks hindering 
  the development of a secure and trusted GII."

The coalition pledged to work together to formulate recommendations for 
an alternative cryptography policy based on the following principals:

* ROBUST SECURITY:  access to levels of encryption sufficient to address 
  domestic and international security threats, especially as advances in 
  computing power make currently deployed cryptography systems less 
  secure.

* INTERNATIONAL INTEROPERABILITY:  the ability to securely interact 
  worldwide.

* VOLUNTARY USE: freedom for users to choose encryption solutions, 
  developed in the marketplace, that meet their particular needs.

* ACCEPTANCE BY THE MARKETPLACE: commercial viability and ability to 
  meet the expressed needs of cryptography users.

* CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVACY PROTECTIONS: safeguards to ensure basic Fourth 
  Amendment privacy protection and regulation of searches, seizures, and 
  interceptions.

* RESPECT FOR THE LEGITIMATE NEEDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT and national 
  security, while recognizing the reality that determined criminals will 
  have access to virtually unbreakable encryption.

A second group, composed of conservative/libertarian organizations 
including Americans for Tax Reform and Citizens for A Sound Economy, 
issued a similar letter on Wednesday to House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The 
text of that letter, as well as additional information on the 
cryptography policy debate, can be found on CDT's Cryptography Issues 
Page:

        URL:http://www.cdt.org/crypto.html

The letters come as the National Institute of Standards & Technology 
(NIST) this week announced revisions to the Administration's proposed 
export criteria announced last September (See CDT Policy Post No. 24). 
The revised proposal is substantively similar to the previous version, 
and maintains controversial provisions including: 

* LIMITS ON KEY LENGTH: The revised proposal would continue to only 
  allow the export of cryptography systems with 64 bit key lengths, but 
  only if the keys are escrowed by an agent approved by the U.S. 
  Government and if the systems meet the other export criteria. 

* RESTRICTED INTEROPERABILITY: While the revised proposal does clarify 
  the interoperability provision,  it would continue to prohibit 
  exportable products from operating with any other cryptographic 
  products that do not meet the NIST criteria.

* NO PRIVACY SAFEGUARDS: The proposal contains no mention of the   
  procedures for law enforcement access to escrowed keys, the standards 
  for certifying escrow agents, or the obligations on escrow agents to 
  protect privacy.

CDT believes that the NIST proposals fall far short of the promise for a 
more sensible and comprehensive cryptography policy outlined last July 
in Vice President Gore's letter to Rep. Maria Cantwell.  The current 
proposal fails to provide adequate security, protect the privacy of 
individuals, and meet the needs of the global marketplace. CDT believes 
that a more comprehensive approach to cryptography policy is necessary 
to address both the immediate need for strong cryptographic applications 
and the long-term development of a secure and trusted Global Information 
Infrastructure. CDT will work with the signatories of the letter to over 
the next six months to develop an alternative to the Administration's 
proposal.

(2) Text of CDT-led Coalition Letter to Vice President Gore


November 8, 1995

The Honorable Albert Gore, Jr.
Office of the Vice President
Old Executive Office Building, Room 276
Washington, D.C. 20501

Dear Mr. Vice President:

A secure, private, and trusted Global Information Infrastructure (GII) 
is essential to promote economic growth and meet the needs of the 
Information Age society.  Competitive businesses need cryptography to 
protect proprietary information as it flows across increasingly 
vulnerable global networks. Individuals require privacy protection in 
order to build the confidence necessary to use the GII for personal and 
financial transactions.  Promoting the development of the GII and 
meeting the needs of the Information Age will require strong, flexible, 
widely-available cryptography.  The undersigned groups recognize that 
the Administration's recently articulated cryptography initiative was a 
serious attempt to meet some of these challenges, but the proposed 
initiative is no substitute for a comprehensive national cryptography 
policy.  To the extent that the current policy becomes a substitute for 
a more comprehensive policy, the initiative actually risks hindering the 
development of a secure and trusted GII.

A number of the undersigned organizations have already written to 
express concern about the latest Administration cryptography initiative. 
As some of us have noted, the Administration's proposed export criteria 
will not allow users to choose the encryption systems that best suit 
their security requirements.  Government ceilings on key lengths will 
not provide an adequate level of security for many applications, 
particularly as advances in computing render current cryptography 
systems less secure.   Competitive international users are steadily 
adopting stronger foreign encryption in their products and will be 
unlikely to embrace U.S. restrictions.  As they stand, current export 
restrictions place U.S. hardware manufacturers, software developers, and 
computer users at a competitive disadvantage, seriously hinder 
international interoperability, and threaten the strategically important 
U.S. communications and computer hardware and software industries. 
Moreover, the Administration policy does not spell out any of the 
privacy safeguards essential to protect individual liberties and to 
build the necessary public trust in the GII. 

The current policy directive also does not address the need for 
immediate liberalization of current export restrictions. Such 
liberalization is vital to enable U.S. companies to export state-of-the-
art software products during the potentially lengthy process of 
developing and adopting a comprehensive national cryptography policy. 
Without relief, industry and individuals alike are faced with an 
unworkable limit on the level of security available and remain hamstrung 
by restrictions that will not be viable in the domestic and 
international marketplace. 

Many members of the undersigned groups have been working actively with 
the Administration on a variety of particular applications, products, 
and programs promoting information security.  All of us are united, 
however, by the concern that the current network and information 
services environment is not as secure as it should be, and that the 
current policy direction will delay the secure, private, and trusted 
environment that is sought.

Despite the difficulties of balancing the competing interests involved, 
the undersigned companies, trade associations, and privacy organizations 
are commencing a process of collective fact-finding and policy 
deliberation, aimed at building consensus around a more comprehensive 
cryptography policy framework that meets the following criteria:  

* ROBUST SECURITY:  access to levels of encryption sufficient to address
  domestic and international security threats, especially as advances in 
  computing power make currently deployed cryptography systems less 
  secure.

* INTERNATIONAL INTEROPERABILITY:  the ability to securely interact 
  worldwide.

* VOLUNTARY USE: freedom for users to choose encryption solutions, 
  developed in the marketplace, that meet their particular needs.

* ACCEPTANCE BY THE MARKETPLACE: commercial viability and ability to 
  meet the expressed needs of cryptography users.

* CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVACY PROTECTIONS: safeguards to ensure basic Fourth 
  Amendment privacy protection and regulation of searches, seizures, and 
  interceptions.

* RESPECT FOR THE LEGITIMATE NEEDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT and national 
  security, while recognizing the reality that determined criminals will  
  have access to virtually unbreakable encryption.

In six months, we plan to present our initial report to the 
Administration, the Congress, and the public in the hopes that it will 
form the basis for a more comprehensive, long-term approach to 
cryptography on the GII. We look forward to working with the 
Administration on this matter.

(1) SUBJECT: New Draft proposed to Revise Exon CDA -- Bill Still
             Unconstitutional

The Communications Decency Act, authored by Senator James Exon
(D-NE), has attracted a firestorm of criticism from nearly all groups that
are concerned about censorship, children's access to controversial material
and the health of the Internet marketplace.  Critics include the American
Family Association, American Online, People for the American Way, and the
United States Justice Department, as well as a variety of civil liberties
and press groups.  In an effort to seek a compromise among these disparate
groups, some parties have drafted a legislative proposal as an alternative
to the current Exon language in the Senate Telecommunications Reform bill.
As far as we know, this draft has not yet been accepted by any parties.

We believe that the draft contains several significant improvements
over the original language, but it still contains unconstitutional
prohibitions against First Amendment-protected speech and fails to fully
account for the unique characteristics of interactive media.

*       The Free Speech Rubicon for Interactive Media

The key flaw remaining in this proposal is its well-intentioned but
overbroad effort to regulate indecent material (the "seven dirty words") in
interactive media.  Regulation of indecency has been found constitutional
only in limited cases involving radio and television broadcasting and
audiotext services.  We believe that given the unique user control
attributes of interactive media, as well as the great abundance of
capacity, it is unconstitutional to regulate indecency in this new medium.
The result of this overbroad regulation is the paradoxical result that
information which is freely available in bookstores, libraries and record
shops will be barred on the Internet.  Such restrictions will stifle the
free flow of information in interactive media and deal a grave blow to the
development of markets for multimedia products and services.

Based on our initial analysis, we have the following comments on
the new language:

A. Unconstitutional restrictions on indecent speech online:  Banning
   the "seven dirty words" on the Net.

If this new proposal became law, the level of discourse on the
Internet as a whole would have to be reduced to that which is considered
appropriate for children.  A newly added section (e) effectively makes it
illegal to use any of the "seven dirty word" in public forums on the
Internet.  This new subsection makes in a crime to "knowingly" make and
transmit an indecent message to anyone under 18 years old.  This provision
covers both private messages between two individuals and public postings to
newsgroups that may well reach hundreds of thousands of people around the
world.  Though the drafters may want to limit this crime to situations
where material is provided directly to minors, that is simply impossible on
the net.  Anyone who participates in public discussion groups knows that
there may well be kids reading the group as well.  Thus, they would be
violating the law simply by posting a hotly-worded message.


Prohibited items under the new subsection (e) include:

        * Rap music lyrics (both the text and the sound files)
        * Lady Chatterly's Lover
        * Public eclaration that you're "pissed off" or that someone
          is a "shit."
        * Calvin Klein ads (the ones with naked bodies)

The constitutional flaw in this section lies in the critical
distinction between "obscenity," that which is truly hard-core pornography,
and "indecency," sexually-explicit material which may be offensive to some
or may be considered by some to be inappropriate for children, but which is
protected by the First Amendment.  Under the First Amendment, Congress has
broad power to regulate obscenity, but can only regulate indecency in very
narrow circumstances, such as in the broadcast media where there is a
captive audience.  Even in these narrow circumstances, such regulation may
be the "least intrusive means" for accomplishing the government's goal of
protecting children.  Given the existence of software and hardware that
enable parents to block children's access to indecent material the
regulation here does not constitute the "least restrictive means"
requirement set out by the Supreme Court.

Furthermore, the government may not regulation indecent material in
a way that would deny adults access to such material.  This is precisely
the result that is produced by this new statutory proposal.  Such as result
would be both unwise and unconstitutional.  The highly restrictive
treatment proposed here for interactive media creates a situation in the
future whereby material that is legally available to people of all ages in
bookshops and libraries will be banned from the Internet.

B. Unfair treatment of individual users, educational institutions and
   other non-commercial services: Pre-emption against restrictive state laws
   only for commercial services

If enacted, this proposal would protect commercial service
providers from additional censorship by state legislatures, but leave all
non-commercial users, including libraries, schools, community groups, and
individuals subject to additional regulation and censorship under state
law.  The proposal pre-empts state statutes that might censor commercial
services beyond the scope of federal law, but leaves all other net users
and groups exposed to any censorship that states may choose to enact.  We
find no valid public policy argument which would accord greater protection
to commercial speech than is granted to non-commercial users of the net.

C. Failure to take full advantage of user and parental control
   features inherent in interactive media

Legislating about new interactive media requires a careful
understanding of the unique attributes of this new medium.  First and
foremost, interactive media enable users (including parents) to exercise
choice over the information that they and their children have access to.
In sharp contrast to older media, government content regulation is simply
not necessary in order to shield children from possibly inappropriate
information.  Any legislative action in this are must identify ways to
promote greater parental and user control.  As drafted, the proposal before
us suggests possible FCC rulemaking on this issue, but is no guaranty that
the Commission would take this course.  Instead of just passing this
critical question off to a regulatory body, Congress must identify both
legal and voluntary means to encourage the development of more and more
flexible and accessible user control techniques.

Conclusion

In light of the serious constitutional concerns raised about the
Act, and the danger that it poses for the development of a vital new
communications medium, we believe that it is essential that the Congress
given careful scrutiny and study to provisions involving the regulation of
indecency in interactive media.  Senator Leahy and Rep. Klink have offered
legislation (S. 714) which would conduct just such as study.  Thoughtful
consideration is essential before moving ahead with legislation that is
both unconstitutional and patently ineffective toward the goal of
protecting children.

1) BOND HEALTH BILL (S 872) WILL EXPOSE PRIVATE HEALTH RECORDS TO 
   UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS

The "Health Information Modernization and Security Act" (S. 872), 
introduced in May by Senator Bond (R-MO), poses a serious threat to 
individual privacy by encouraging the development of health information 
systems that will expose sensitive personal information to unauthorized 
use and access. The Bond bill does not adequately address the threats to 
individual privacy presented by the use of such systems. 

CDT urges Congress to pass legislation such as the Fair Health 
Information Practices Act (H.R. 435) introduced in the House by Gary 
Condit (D-CA). We urge Senator Bond to amend his proposal to incorporate 
the comprehensive privacy protections set out in the Condit bill.

Currently there is no comprehensive federal law that protects the 
confidentiality of personal information that individuals divulge during 
encounters with the health care industry. Yet most individuals consider 
information on their health to be the most sensitive information about 
themselves and to be the information most in need of privacy protection. 
The lack of strong uniform privacy protection for personal health 
information has left individuals vulnerable to privacy violations in a 
paper-based world.

However, the threats to privacy posed by the computerization of personal 
health information without appropriate privacy policies and 
technological mechanisms to control the collection, use, access and 
disclosure, will make such information more vulnerable to abuse than 
ever before.

The traditional barriers of location and time disappear in the age of 
computerization. With birth to death dossiers on each American on line 
the potential for multiple simultaneous access from various locations 
exists. The locked file cabinet that traditionally protected medical 
information from prying eyes must be reinvented for the age of 
automation. Legislation to protect the privacy of health information is 
urgently needed.

As health care reform came to a halt at the end of the 103rd Congress, a 
piece of health care reform legislation that received support from 
Democrats, Republicans, health providers, health insurers, and privacy 
advocates was the Fair Health Information Practices Act (introduced by 
Senator Pat Leahy (D-VT) and Representative Condit. The bill was coupled 
with an earlier version of Bond's Health Information Modernization Bill. 
In fact, the privacy protections for health information found in these 
proposals were fleshed out versions of language contained in every major 
piece of health care reform legislation in Congress. Protecting the 
privacy and confidentiality of health information is one of the issues 
on which broad consensus was reached during the health care debate last 
year. 

Without a detailed privacy section, the Health Information Modernization 
and Security Act harkens back to provisions in President Clinton's 
Health Security Act that received widespread ridicule. Like the 
Administration's Health Security Act, Senator Bond's proposal fails to 
fully address the confidentiality of personal health information. 

The Health Information Modernization and Security Act fails to 
incorporate privacy and security standards into the legislation. It 
directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish 
standards for the implementation of privacy and security within eighteen 
months of enactment.

The lack of privacy, confidentiality and security provisions within the 
Act is disturbing, since a goal of the bill is "encouraging the 
development of a health information network through the establishment of 
standards and requirements for the electronic transmission of certain 
health information." The Act would greatly increase the ease with which 
information is accessed, compiled, exchanged and manipulated. The 
failings of this bifurcated approach to policy and technology were 
readily apparent to the Administration, Congress, privacy advocates and 
the private sector in 1994. If Congress advocates a move to automated 
record keeping, it must simultaneously protect the sensitive information 
on individuals that will be stored and transmitted by these systems. 
Before the government accelerates or mandates computerization in the 
health care field, it is crucial comprehensive privacy protections for 
health information be established. 

During last Congress there was consensus that health information systems 
could not be designed and constructed without enforceable privacy rules 
in place. It is neither reasonable nor rational to design a system 
knowing that the sensitive information each American would be asked to 
entrust would be largely unprotected from misuse and abuse, and that the 
failure to address privacy up front would likely lead to a complete 
system redesign or overhaul years later at an increased cost. 

We urge Senator Bond and Congress to ensure that personal health 
information is protected by strong enforceable privacy protections.

2) ANALYSIS OF BOND S. 872

General Provisions: Titles I & II

The objective of the proposal is to encourage the development of a 
health information network through the establishment of standards and 
requirements for the electronic transmission of certain health 
information. (Sec. 101) The Secretary of HHS is given responsibility for 
adopting standards for data elements and transactions, but is to be 
guided by current practice and by standards developed or modified by a 
standards setting organization (this is likely to be the American 
National Standard Institute - ANSI). (Sec. 1172) Sec. 1174 requires that 
the Secretary adopt standards relating to the information transactions, 
data elements and security and privacy within 18 months of enactment.

The Secretary is to adopt uniform standards to increase the electronic 
availability of "financial and administrative transactions: claims or 
equivalent encounter information, claims attachments, enrollment and 
disenrollment, eligibility, payment and remittance advice, premium 
payments, first report of injury, claims status, referral certification 
and authorization," and "other transactions determined appropriate by 
the Secretary consistent with the goals of improving the operation of 
the health care systems and reducing administrative costs." (Sec. 
1173(a)(1)). 

In addition, the Secretary is to adopt a unique health identifier for 
each individual. (Sec. 1174(b)(1)). Sec. 1177 sets penalties for use of 
the unique health identifier that are not authorized by the Secretary.

The Secretary is to promulgate regulations specifying procedures for the 
electronic transmission and authentication of signatures that will meet 
current federal and state written signature requirements, "pen & quill" 
laws. (Sec. 1173(d)1)

Privacy and Security Standards:

Section 1172(b)(1) requires each person who "maintains or transmits 
health information or data elements that are subject to this Act" to 
maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and 
physical safeguards to ensure integrity and confidentiality and to 
protect against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards and 
unauthorized uses and disclosures.

Section 1174(b) gives the Secretary one and one-half years post 
enactment to establish the standards for implementing the privacy 
standards.

Penalties for Wrongful Disclosure of Individually Identifiable Health 
Information

Under Section 1177, individuals who violate the privacy standards, which 
govern obtaining or disclosing individually identifiable health 
information, established by the Secretary, may be fined up to $50,000 
and imprisoned up to 1 year, or both. If the offense is committed under 
false pretenses the fine can be up to $100,000 and the sentence up to 5 
years. If the offense is committed with the intent to sell, transfer, 
use for commercial advantage or personal gain, or use to maliciously 
harm the individual, the fine may be up to $250,000 and the sentence up 
to 10 years.

Preemption

The Act would preempt contrary provisions of State laws, including 
"requirements or standards that are more stringent than the requirements 
or standards under the Act, except: 1) where the requirement is more 
stringent with respect to electronic transmissions of financial or 
administrative transactions from providers to plans and incorporates 
standards adopted under the bill; 2) more stringent with respect to the 
privacy of individually identifiable health information; of 3) is an 
already enacted provisions governing the coordination of benefits; or 4) 
in the Secretary's judgment, is necessary to curtail fraud and abuse. 
(Sec. 1178) The Act does not invalidate or curtail public health 
reporting laws. (Sec. 1178(b)).


Health Information Advisory Committee

Section 1179 establishes a Health Information Advisory Committee (15 
members) to advise and assist the Secretary. The Committee is directed 
to study the issues of uniform standards and electronic exchange and 
report to the Secretary within four years of enactment. The Committee is 
to report annually on compliance with the act. The report will address 
compliance with privacy and security standards among other issues.

Standards for Patient Medical Record Information 

Under Section 1180, within four to six years, the Secretary shall 
recommend a plan for developing and implementing uniform data standards 
for patient medical record information and the electronic exchange of 
such information.

Grants for Demonstration Projects

The Secretary is given the right to make grants for demonstration 
projects aimed at promoting the development and use of electronically 
integrated, community-based clinical information systems and 
computerized patient medical records.

----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
3) WHAT YOU CAN DO

There is currently a companion bill in the House of Representatives, 
H.R. 1766, the Health Information Modernization and Security Act, 
introduced by Representative Thomas Sawyer (D-OH) and Representative 
David Hobson (R-OH). This bill is very similar to Senator Bond's bill. 
All concerns held by the Center for Democracy and Technology for Senator 
Bond's bill are also held for H.R. 1766. 

We urge you to contact Senator Bond (202) 224-5721 to voice your concern 
over S. 872, Health Information Modernization and Security Act, and 
Representatives Hobson (202) 225-4324 and Sawyer (202) 225-5231 over the 
House bill H.R. 1766, Health Information Modernization and Security Act.

(1) ADMINISTRATION CRYPTO POLICY FLOPS AT CONFERENCE

On September 6 and 7, the Clinton Administration unveiled a new national 
cryptography policy at a conference sponsored by the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST). 

CDT believes that the new proposal fails to provide adequate privacy 
protection, would effectively eliminate the domestic market for non-
escrowed encryption applications, and is weighed too heavily toward the 
interests of the National Security Agency.

The administration has proposed to relax export controls on 
cryptographic applications (both software and hardware) with key lengths 
up to 64 bits provided that:

* The keys required to decrypt a message or file are escrowed with an 
  agent certified by the US government (including private entities)

* The product does not decrypt messages or files encrypted with non-
  escrowed products or products whose escrow mechanisms have been 
  altered or disabled.

* As well as eight other criteria (the proposal is attached below).

NEW PROPOSAL FAILS TO ADHERE TO CRITERIA IN GORE LETTER TO CANTWELL.

In a July 1994 letter to then Representative Maria Cantwell, Vice 
President Gore announced that the Administration intended to re-examine 
its cryptography policy. The Gore letter, which was widely viewed as an 
abandonment of the Clipper Chip Government Key Escrow scheme, pledged to 
develop a policy framework that would promote the development of 
encryption systems that would meet the following criteria:

* Implementation in hardware of Software
* Public, Unclassified Algorithms
* Voluntary
* Forth Amendment privacy Safeguards
* Statutory liability rules to protect users
* Multiple Escrow Agents

On hearing that the Administration had set out to develop a new 
encryption policy based on the principles outlined in the Gore letter, 
the Center for Democracy and Technology was guardedly optimistic that a 
genuine policy breakthrough was possible.  However, having had the 
opportunity to review the current proposal, every principle, except the 
first (software implementation) and second (public algorithms), outlined 
in the July 1994 letter is violated or, in one case, left in doubt, by 
the September 1995 policy statement.

The September 1995 policy statement diverges from the July 1994 letter 
in the following critical respects.  In our view, these divergences 
represent fundamental defects in the proposed policy.

* NOT VOLUNTARY:  The current proposal effectively compels all domestic 
  users to use key escrow systems if they ever intend to communicate 
  internationally.  Point 6 of the export criteria requires that an 
  exportable system must not interoperate with any system that non-
  escrow systems.  Thus, in order for a user in the United States to 
  communicate with anyone who uses a United States-made system on the 
  Internet but outside of the United States, the American user must 
  employ a key escrow system.  Domestic users are not legally compelled 
  to use key escrow products, but the proposed policy forces, in 
  practice, all but the most insular Internet user toward a key escrow 
  system. Moreover, this proposal further illustrates that the 
  Administration seeks to use export controls to push the domestic use 
  of escrowed cryptography. A policy based on such compulsion can hardly 
  be called voluntary. 

* INADEQUATE SECURITY:  Point 1 precludes export of systems with key 
  lengths beyond 64 bits.  Though this key size is larger than what is 
  currently exportable, it is a level of security already judged 
  inadequate for some applications.  Given the rate at which computing 
  power increases, even a 64 bit key would be subject to attach before 
  long. Ironically, even the Clipper Chip provided a stronger (80 bit) 
  key length

  The premise of the key escrow policy is to provide law enforcement 
  and national security agencies a "front door" to be used to decrypt 
  messages when the agency obtains proper legal authorization.  Yet, the 
  architects of the current policy apparently are not willing to trust 
  that key escrow systems will meet law enforcement needs inasmuch as 
  the key length limit suggests that the Administration is intent on 
  maintaining an extra-legal method of decrypting communications.  The 
  Gore letter contains no suggestion that key escrow systems would also 
  be subject to key length limits but the Administration seems to have 
  lost faith in its own proposal.  Such a half-hearted effort cannot be 
  the basis of a long-lasting policy.

* NO PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR USERS OF ESCROWED SYSTEMS:  The ten export 
  principles make no mention of privacy safeguards which the Vice 
  President previously recognized as necessary to safeguard individual 
  privacy and Fourth Amendment principles.  Any escrow policy must 
  contain safeguards against abuse and statutory liability provisions 
  for the operators of private escrow systems.

* FAILS TO PROMOTE INTERNATIONAL INTEROPERABILITY:  Points 6 and 10 of 
  the export criteria raise grave doubts as to the likelihood that the 
  current proposal will give rise to a secure global communications 
  environment.  Point 10 forces users in other countries (and their 
  governments) to accept United States-based escrow of all keys until 
  bilateral access agreements are entered into.  Such tactics seem 
  unlikely to produce satisfactory international agreements, and hold 
  global communications security hostage to the completion of such 
  agreements.

NSA/ADMINISTRATION SEEK TO RUSH IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW POLICY

The NIST Key escrow conference was billed as an opportunity to begin a 
dialogue between the administration and industry on the new cryptography 
policy. However, as the conference began it quickly became apparent that 
many of the critical policy issues, including the 64 bit key length, 
interoperability with non-escrow products, and some requirements for key 
escrow agents (including whether individuals, corporations, and foreign 
entities are eligible) have already been decided. 

The Administrations attempt to rush many of the critical policy 
decisions drew sharp reaction from virtually all of the conference 
participants, including CDT, other public interest groups, and 
representatives from several major software and hardware manufacturers. 
Although the administration and NSA officials all indicated that they 
got the message, they still intend to publish a revised policy in the 
next 30 days for comment.

INDUSTRY BALKS

Industry reaction to the new policy proposal was, with a few limited 
exceptions, decidedly negative. Both during formal presentations and in 
small group sessions, representatives from several of the largest 
hardware manufacturers and software publishers questioned whether the 
market would support products designed to adhere to the administration's 
proposal, particularly in light of the 64 bit key length limit.

CDT believes that the administration must make every effort to 
accommodate the concerns of the public, civil liberties groups, software 
publishers, hardware manufacturers, users, and other interested parties 
before adopting any new national cryptography policy. The current 
proposal fails to address many of the critical concerns of public 
interest groups and industry, and should be abandoned.

NEXT STEPS

The administration intends to published a revised policy within the next 
30 days (October 7). CDT will closely monitor this issue and will inform 
you as it develops.

(2) THE ADMINISTRATION'S NEW CRYPTOGRAPHY POLICY

9/1/95 Proposed Cryptography Policy for Software Key Escrow

Key Escrow Issues Meeting, September 6-7, 1995
Discussion Paper #3

            Export Criteria Discussion Draft --
           64-bit Software Key Escrow Encryption

As discussed at the SPA/AEA meeting on August 17, 1995, the
Administration is willing to allow the export of software
encryption provided that the products use algorithms with key
space that does not exceed 64 bits and the key(s) required to
decrypt messages/files are escrowed with approved escrow agents. 
On the same date, the September 6-7 key escrow issues meeting at
NIST was also announced.  The two principal topics at the meeting
will be:  discussion of issues of exportability of 64-bit
software key escrow encryption and 2) desirable characteristics
for key escrow agents. 

In order to help make most productive use of the limited time
available at the upcoming meeting and to better focus
deliberation, the following criteria are being distributed for
discussion purposes.  Since it is important that final criteria
be clear, straightforward, consistent, and implementable, please
review these draft criteria and be prepared to discuss 
how they may be refined and made more specific.  

                          --- Draft Export Criteria ---

for Software Key Escrow Encryption 

Software key escrow encryption products meeting the following
criteria will be granted special export licensing treatment
similar to that afforded other mass-market software products with
encryption.  

1.    The product will use an unclassified encryption algorithm
      (e.g., DES, RC4) with a key length not to exceed 64 bits.

2.    The product shall be designed to prevent multiple
      encryption (e.g., triple-DES).

3.    The key required to decrypt each message or file shall be
      accessible through a key escrow mechanism in the product,
      and such keys will be escrowed during manufacture in
      accordance with #10.  If such keys are not escrowed during
      manufacture, the product shall be inoperable until the key
      is escrowed in accordance with #10.

4.    The key escrow mechanism shall be designed to include with
      each encrypted message or file, in a format accessible by
      authorized entities, the identity of the key escrow
      agent(s), and information sufficient for the escrow
      agent(s) to identify the key or key components required to
      decrypt that message.

5.    The product shall be resistant to any alteration that would
      disable or circumvent the key escrow mechanism, to include
      being designed so that the key escrow mechanism cannot be
      disabled by a static patch, (i.e., the replacement of a
      block of code by a modified block).

6.    The product shall not decrypt messages or files encrypted
      by non-escrowed products, including products whose key
      escrow mechanisms have been altered or disabled.

7.    The key escrow mechanism allows access to a user's
      encrypted information regardless of whether that user is
      the sender or the intended recipient of the encrypted
      information.

8.    The key escrow mechanism shall not require repeated
      involvement by the escrow agents for the recovery of
      multiple decryption keys during the period of authorized

(1) SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HOLDS CYBERPORN HEARING

SUMMARY

On Monday July 24, 1995 the Senate Judiciary Committee held the first 
ever hearing on the issue of children's access to inappropriate material 
on the Internet. The principal focus of the hearing was to discuss 
Senator Grassley's "Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act 
of 1995" (S. 892). CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman testified before 
the panel.

Senator Grassley (R-IA) deserves praise for holding the first 
Congressional hearing on this important issue. In addition, both Senator 
Grassley and Senator Leahy took great pains to ensure that both sides of 
the issue were represented. Although CDT may disagree with Senator 
Grassley's approach, we believe that this hearing represented an 
essential step towards advancing the dialogue on what has become an 
over-hyped and dramatically misunderstood issue.

Senator Grassley's legislation, which has been co-sponsored by several 
other prominent members such as Dole (R-KS), Hatch (R-UT), and Thurmond 
(R-SC), would impose criminal penalties on a service provider that 
"knowingly" transmits indecent material to a minor, or who "willfully" 
permits its network to be used to transmit indecent material to a minor 
(S. 892, Sec (b)(2) & (b)(3)). 

Two important points emerged from the testimony:

1. Current law prohibits the distribution of obscenity and child
   pornography, as well as online stalking and solicitation of minors.
   As troubling and disturbing as some of the testimony was, no evidence
   was presented that there are gaps in current law which would be
   filled by the Grassley legislation.
 
2. Serious questions exist as to the constitutionality of the Grassley
   Bill. Although Senator Grassley has repeatedly stated that his bill 
   is narrowly drawn and targets only the bad actors, no evidence was
   presented to establish that a court would not interpret the statute 
   more broadly, resulting in a complete ban on constitutionally 
   protected speech online.

WITNESSES

Witnesses testifying before the panel included:

* Donnelle Gruff, a 15 year old Florida girl described as a victim of an
  online stalker,
* Patricia Shao, a mother of two from Baltimore MD and volunteer for
  Enough Is Enough
* Dr. Susan Elliot, a mother from McLean VA

* Bill Burrington, Assistant General Counsel, America Online
* Barry Crimmins, a children's rights advocate
* Stephen Balkam, Executive Director, Recreational Software Advisory
  Counsel

* Jerry Berman, Executive Director, Center for Democracy and Technology
* Michael S. Hart, Executive Director of Project Gutteberg, Professor of 
  Electronic Texts, Illinois Benedictine College
* Dee Jepsen, Enough Is Enough (an anti-pornography group)

DOES THE GRASSLEY BILL PROTECT CHILDREN?

The testimony of 15 year old Donnelle Gruff focused on her experience as 
the victim of a stalker, while Dr. Elliot and Ms. Shao, two mothers of 
young children, described how their children had used commercial online 
services to access files they deemed inappropriate. 

Donnelle Gruff testified that she had been harassed and stalked by the 
sysop of a Florida BBS she had visited. The sysop had obtained her name, 
age, and address from her records and reportedly stalked Gruff while she 
was at home.

During questioning however, Gruff's step-father told Senator Patrick 
Leahy (D-VT) that Florida law enforcement officials were currently 
investigating the case, and that they had given no indication that 
current law is insufficient with respect to prosecuting such cases. 
Senator Leahy noted that, as difficult and disturbing as Gruff's case 
is, it illustrates a need for additional law enforcement resources and 
education, but is not an issue of gaps in current federal or state laws. 
Senator Leahy mentioned similar recent prosecutions in Florida, and 
noted that the Grassley legislation does not explicitly prohibit online 
stalking of minors.

In addition, Senator Leahy questioned whether government content 
restrictions would be an effective solution to protecting children 
online. "I hear a lot of rhetoric (from Congress) about getting 
government out of our lives, but here it seems as if the rhetoric is a 
little off of reality. Parents, not the government, should make the 
choices" about what their children should be permitted to access.

Both Dr. Elliot and Ms. Shao testified that their children had stumbled 
across material while surfing the Internet that they, as parents, felt 
should not be accessible to children. Both described how their children 
had accessed "pornographic" images, and had been propositioned for 
"cybersex" while visiting a chat room on a commercial online service. In 
addition, Dr. Elliot described some of the images as representing 
'bestiality and sodomy'.

Barry Crimmins, a child protection advocate, testified that he has found 
numerous images of child pornography on America Online. Crimmins accused 
AOL of neglecting to adequately police its network. When questioned by 
Senator Leahy, Crimmins acknowledged that the distribution of child 
pornography and stalking or solicitation of minors is prohibited under 
current law. Crimmins added that while he thought the commercial online 
service should do more to remove such material, he believes that more 
vigorous enforcement of existing law would help to address his concerns.

WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF THE ISSUE -- IS CURRENT LAW SUFFICIENT?

Often in the course of the debate on this issue, the term "pornographic" 
is assumed to be interchangeable with both "indecency" and "obscenity". 
However as Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI) noted, "pornography" has no 
legal standing, and when legislating in this area Congress must be 
careful to avoid confusing these legal distinctions. 

In determining what material would be considered illegal under current 
law, the distinction between "obscene" and "indecent" material must be 
made completely clear. When pressed by Senator Feingold, Dr. Elliot 
agreed that precise definitions are important, but argued that the files 
that her child downloaded from the Internet that depicted bestiality and 
sodomy that would be, "obscene by any standard". 

Images of bestiality and sodomy, as Dr. Elliot described, would be 
considered obscene in virtually every community in the United States, 
and hence are illegal under current law. Though it raises difficult 
jurisdictional questions, obscenity has been clearly defined by the 
Courts. Moreover, trafficking in obscenity (18 USC Sec 1462, 1464, 1466) 
as well as child pornography (18 USC Sec 2252) have been successfully 
applied to punish conduct on computer networks. As Senator Leahy pointed 
out in his statement, the Justice Department is currently prosecuting 
cases involving material similar to that described by Dr. Elliot.

Indecent material, on the other hand, is constitutionally protected and 
is much more difficult to define. The most common understanding of what 
constitutes indecent material includes the 7 dirty words, images of 
nudity, and other suggestive material. Moreover, the Supreme Court has 
ruled that any attempts by government to restrict access to indecent 
material must be accomplished in the "least restrictive means", and the 
determination of this standard is entirely dependent on the medium (see 
Sable Communications v. FCC, 492 US 115; 109 S.Ct. 2829; 106 L.Ed. 2d 93 
(1989). 

Some of the material described by the witnesses would be considered 
obscene, and hence is already prohibited under current law. Other 
examples, including Ms. Shao's description of her daughter being 
propositioned for "cybersex", would likely not be considered obscene. 

Senator Feingold urged the committee to carefully consider the 
distinctions between "obscene" and "indecent" speech, and urged his 
colleagues to "exercise caution and restraint." 

How broadly should we define indecency, Feingold asked Dr. Elliot, 
"Where should we draw the line? Should we prohibit Playboy? swearing? 
The Catcher In The Rye? What about a discussion forum about how to avoid 
getting AIDS?". 

Because technologies currently exist to screen out messages such as 
those described by Ms. Shao, it is unlikely that a broad prohibition on 
such messages would pass constitutional muster. In this case, Congress 
must look to other, less restrictive methods of preventing children from 
having access to such materials -- including promoting the development 
and availability of user control technologies.

CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES

Throughout the hearing, Senator Grassley stated that his legislation is 
carefully crafted and narrowly drawn in order to preserve the First 
Amendment rights of adults while protecting children from inappropriate 
material. Grassley stated that his bill would hold an online service 
provider liable only in cases where they "knowingly" allow their network 
to be used to transmit indecent material to a minor or "willfully" allow 
an individual to use their network to do so. 

However, as CDT's Jerry Berman and America Online's Bill Burrington 
argued the wording of the statute and the variety of possible 
interpretations could lead to severe chilling effect on the free flow of 
legitimate information in cyberspace and force online service providers 
to limit or remove certain areas of their service.

BROAD KNOWLEDGE REQUIREMENT

The scope of the "knowing" standard in the Grassley bill is an issue of 
some dispute. Senator Grassley and his staff maintain that it is 
intended to apply narrowly, but no evidence was presented that 
demonstrated why a court would apply a narrow interpretation. 

Berman cautioned that because of this uncertainty, online service 
providers would be forced to rely on the broadest possible 
interpretation of the statute in order to avoid liability, resulting in 
a severe chilling effect on all online communications:

"The threat of a broad interpretation of this new statute would compel 
all who provide access to the Internet to restrict *all* public 
discussion areas and public information sources from subscribers, unless 
they prove that they are over the age of eighteen.  Under this statute, 
a service provider could not even provide Internet access to a minor 
*with the approval* of the child's parent.  Since every online service 
provider would have to similarly restrict access to minors, this 
proposed statute would create two separate Internets, one for children 
and one for adults."

America Online's Bill Burrington agreed, stating that the potential for 
a broad interpretation of the statute would compel AOL and other online 
service providers to adhere to the broadest possible reading in order to 
avoid potential liability.  Burrington argued that would force AOL to 
shut down many parts of its service and place providers in the 
unenviable position of national censor.

"Constitutional guarantees of free speech and press should be cautiously 
guarded," Burrington stated, "The online service provider industry 
should be encouraged to provide *voluntary* editorial control over its 
service and to continue its research and development of parental 
empowerment technology tools.  This industry should not be cast in the 
role of national censor, determining which information may be fit for 
children, but nonetheless subject to criminal liability if it guesses 
incorrectly in any given instance." 

Senator Dewine (R-OH) asked several questions of many of the witnesses, 
and expressed concerne about the potential for an overly board 
interpretation of the knowledge standard.

BROAD INTERPRETATION OF 'INDECENCY'

As addressed earlier, a precise definition of 'indecent' speech has 
never been firmly established, and whether material would be considered 
indecent depends largely on the nature of the medium it is communicated 
through. Because of this, and because under the Grassley bill carriers 
would be liable for transmitting indecent speech, carriers would be 
forced to adhere to the broadest, most inclusive definition of 
indecency. This would include, among other things, the 7 dirty words, 
description of genitalia, nudity, and other material which is protected 
in other media.

This issue was raised by Michael Hart, Executive Director of Project 
Gutteberg, who stressed that broad restrictions on indecency would 
prevent people from enjoying serious works of fiction on the Internet. 
Project Gutteberg makes electronic texts of books available on the 
Internet. Hart stated, with great emotion, that the proposed indecency 
restrictions contemplated by the Grassley bill would force him to remove 
some of Shakespeare's plays, The Catcher In The Rye, Lady Chatterly's 
Lover, Alice in Wonderland, and other books which have been classified 
as indecent in some parts of the United States. Although such an effect 
may not be intended by the drafters of the Grassley legislation, no 
evidence was offered at the hearing to counter Mr. Hart's concerns.

EXON vs. BERMAN

CDT's Jerry Berman urged the Committee to act cautiously before voting 
to further restrict First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech.  
Berman urged the Senate to fulfill its traditional role as the 
"deliberative body", and to carefully consider the implications before 
enacting broad new statutes to cover new media.  Referring to both the 
Exon CDA and the Grassley bill, Berman stressed that the country would 
be better served if the Senate did not enact legislation simply to 
"provide the illusion that the United States Senate could do something 
in this area".

This remark drew a sharp rebuttal from Senator Exon, who, though not a 
member of the Judiciary Committee, sat in on the hearing on the 
invitation of Senator Grassley.  Exon defended his bill and accused CDT 
and others of launching "viscous attacks" against him and his 
legislation. Berman was not given a chance to respond.

"We are concerned about the situation", Exon argued, yet "we are 
viscously attacked for trying to have a rational discussion.  We don't 
want to create a false sense of security [but] we have a responsibility 
to protect children".  In addition, Exon dismissed parental control 
technologies as too little too late, arguing that "for every block there 
is a way around that block", and that such technologies may not be 
available in every home, allowing children to access inappropriate 
material at the homes of neighbors who may not employ such tools.

WHAT WAS LEARNED?

Although the hearing did illustrate that sexually explicit material can 
be found on the Internet, no substantial evidence was presented to 
indicate that law enforcement is currently unable to prosecute 
violations of obscenity, child pornography, stalking, or child 
solicitation laws. Moreover, although Senator Grassley intends his 
legislation to be narrow, serious questions were raised about whether 
other, more board interpretations are possible. 

In our opinion, the hearing illustrated that current law is sufficient 
to prosecute those who stalk or solicit children online, and that 
complex constitutional issues are raised by congressional attempts to 
restrict indecent material on the Internet.

(2) HOUSE SCIENCE SUBCOMMITTEE HOLDS 'PARENTAL CONTROL TECHNOLOGY' 
HEARING

Two subcommittees of the House Science Committee held a joint hearing  
today (July 26, 1995) on the availability of parental control 
technologies to prevent children from accessing inappropriate material 
on the Internet. The hearing, held by the Subcommittee on Basic 
Research, Chaired by Rep. Schiff (R-NM) and the Subcommittee on 
Technology, Chaired by Rep. Morella (R-FL) provided an important 
counter-balance to Monday's Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing.

Witnesses testifying before the committee included:

Witnesses Demonstrating Technology Solutions

* Tony Rutkowski, Executive Director of the Internet Society
* Ann Duvall, President of SurfWatch Software
* Steve Heaton, General Counsel and Secretary, Compuserve

Law Enforcement Witnesses

* Kevin Manson, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center
* Mike Geraghty, Trooper, New Jersey State Police
* Lee Hollander, Assistant States Attorney, Naples Florida

LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SAY CURRENT LAW SUFFICIENT, EXON BILL FLAWED

Today's hearing marked the first time law enforcement officials have 
testified on the issue of children's access to inappropriate material on 
the Internet. All three law enforcement witnesses agreed that, in their 
experience, current law is sufficient to prosecute online stalking, 
solicitation of minors, and the distribution of pornography and child 
pornography. All three said that they are vigorously prosecuting such 
cases. 

Instead of enacting new law, New Jersey State Trooper Mike Geraghty said 
that protecting children is "a matter of training law enforcement 
officers, prosecutors, lawyers and judges about how to enforce existing 
laws [with respect to computer networks]. The laws are good, we have to 
learn how to enforce them".

The three law enforcement witnesses further argued that the Senate-
passed Exon/Coats Communications Decency Act is the wrong approach to 
addressing an issue that is already covered under existing law. "I have 
several problems with the Exon bill as a prosecutor, both in terms of 
its practical enforcement and its constitutionality" said Florida 
Assistant States Attorney Hollander said.

TRANSACTIONAL PRIVACY PROTECTIONS CRITICIZED

In an slightly unrelated asside, Florida Assistant States Attorney Lee 
Hollander criticized privacy protections for online transactional 
information as a hindrance to law enforcement. 

As part of last years Digital Telephony legislation, the standard for 
law enforcement access to online transactional records (logs that 
indicate what files an individual accessed from online archives and 
electronic mail transactions) was raised from a requirement of a mere 
subpoena to a court order from a judge based on the showing of "specific 
and articulable facts" that such records are "relevant and material to 
an ongoing criminal investigation". The higher standard was widely seen 
as a victory for online privacy.

In response to a question of what Congress could do to help aid 
enforcement of existing law, Hollander noted that the higher standard 
for online transactional records adds an additional burden to law 
enforcement investigations. Calling it part of a "ballance between 
privacy and law enforcement", Hollander did not suggest that Congress 
should repeal the court order requirement, only that it made 
prosecutions more difficult (*NOTE: Members of CDT staff worked closely 
on this issue, and consider the court order standard to be a tremendous 
victory for online privacy).

EXON CDA CONDEMNED BY ALL

Condemnation of the Senate-passed CDA was not limited to the law 
enforcement witnesses. Not a single member of the Subcommittee stated 
support for the CDA, and all expressed concern that the issue had not 
received sufficient public consideration by Congress. 

Chairwoman Morella stressed that Congress should consider technological 
options to empower parents to exercise control over what their children 
access online before rushing to enact new laws. Rep. Geren (D-TX) 
expressed concern about the First Amendment implications of the CDA. 
Rep. Vern Elhers (R-MI) stated that he would "oppose bills that make 
network access providers (legally) responsible for the content they 
carry". In what was perhaps the strongest condemnation of the Senate-
passed Communications Decency Act, Rep. Zoe Loefgren (D-CA) said, "While 
well intentioned, the Exon bill a totally wrong approach and a complete 
misunderstanding of the Technology."

PARENTAL CONTROL TECHNOLOGY IS THE ONLY EFFECTIVE SOLUTION

Internet Society Executive Director Tony Rutkowski provided Committee 
members with a basic overview of the Internet and noted that the 
Internet Society (ISOC) and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) are 
currently looking at content tagging and other voluntary rating systems 
for future Internet protocols. Rutkowski stressed that centralized, 
command and control style content restrictions would be ineffective in 
the global, distributed network environment of the Internet. Rutkowski 
further noted that objectionable material constitutes a minuscule amount 
(less than .05%) of the total traffic on the network. 

Because of the global reach of the Internet and the millions of 
potential content providers, Rutkowski argued, the only effective means 
of addressing the availability of inappropriate material is to provide 
user control applications to empower parents to block and filter what 
the and their children access. 

SurfWatch President Ann Duvall, demonstrated SurfWatch, and described 
the product as "just one example of the computer industry responding to 
needs created by the explosive growth of technology".  Duvall stressed 
that the industry is developing solutions which are simple to use, 
inexpensive, and empower parents to make their own choices about what 
they or their children should see. 

Expressing concern about legislative efforts to control content online, 
Duvall noted that 30% of the sites blocked by SurfWatch reside outside 
the United States. "There is not a simple, national solution to the 
problem of children accessing inappropriate material on the Internet. 
Excessive government regulations might jeopardize private sector 
opportunities. SurfWatch firmly believes that the technology industry 
can and must respond to these socio-technological issues. We also affirm 
that parents must be involved in any solution"

Compuserve General Counsel Steve Heaton agreed with some of the 
Committee members that parents have a right to be concerned about the 
availability of certain material on the Internet, but stressed that 
government solutions are no substitute for empowering users. Heaton 
described some of the current parental control technology, and outlined 
Compuserve's plans to develop KidNet, an interactive service designed 
specifically for kids. 

Heaton cautioned against overly broad attempts to regulate content on 
the Internet and other interactive communications service: "The cyber 
community, made up of hundreds of thousands of computers distributed 
across the globe, is truly a world without borders. Directly regulating 
cyberspace -- history's only true functioning anarchy -- may prove 
impossible. This makes it imperative that laws focus on individual 
responsibility and that education and empowerment among users and 
concerned parents be emphasized."

          Activities.................................      
     C.   The Defenses Provided In The Act Do Not
          Provide A Technologically or Economically

     D.   There Are Existing Ways To Protect Minors
          From Speech That Would Be Inappropriate
          For Them, That Do Not Ban Or Burden
          Speech To Adults...........................      

ARGUMENT.............................................      

I.   THE ACT EFFECTIVELY BANS AN ENORMOUS QUANTITY
     OF SPEECH THAT IS CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED
     FOR ADULTS, AND THE SUPREME COURT HAS REPEATEDLY
     HELD THAT GOVERNMENT CANNOT REDUCE THE ADULT
     POPULATION TO READING AND VIEWING ONLY WHAT IS
     APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN........................      

     A.   The Act's Content-Based Restrictions On
          Indecent Speech Are Subject To Strict
          Scrutiny, And Cannot Be Upheld Unless the
          Government Proves That the Restrictions
          Materially Advance a Compelling Interest
          In the Least Restrictive Way, And Proves
          That the Benefit To Be Gained From the
          Restrictions Outweighs And Does Not Unduly
          Burden the First Amendment Rights of
          Adults.....................................      

     B.   The Challenged Provisions Of The Act
          Violate The Principles Established In
          Butler, Bolger And Sable That Adults
          Cannot Be Reduced To Reading And Viewing
          Only What Is Appropriate For Children......      

     C.   The Act Also Violates The First Amendment
          Because The Government Cannot Prove That
          It Materially Advances A Compelling
          Interest In The Least Restrictive Manner...      

II.  THE ACT IS SUBSTANTIALLY AND FATALLY OVERBROAD..      

     A.   The Subsection (d) "Display" Prohibition
          Is Grossly Overbroad Because in Nearly
          Every Application, It Bans or Severely
          Burdens Speech That Is Constitutionally
          Protected for Adults.......................      

     B.   The Act Is Also Overbroad Because It
          Prohibits Speech to All Persons Under
          18 Years of Age on the Basis of What
          Is Inappropriate for Young Children........      

III. THE SWEEPING PROHIBITION OF PROTECTED SPEECH
     ON THE INTERNET CANNOT BE SAVED BY ANALOGY TO
     CASES IN WHICH COURTS HAVE UPHELD LIMITED
     INDECENCY RESTRICTIONS SHORT OF A BAN, OR BY
     INVOKING THE STANDARDS OF FIRST AMENDMENT
     REVIEW GOVERNING BROADCAST MEDIA................      

     A.   Judicial Decisions Upholding Narrow
          Indecency Restriction for "Dial-a-Porn,"
          Broadcast Media, and Leased Access Cable
          Television--None of Which Involved a
          Total Ban--Are Entirely Inapposite.........      

     B.   The Unique First Amendment Standards 
          Governing the Broadcast Media Do Not
          Apply to Cyberspace........................      

     C.   The Internet's Unmatched Capacity for
          Furthering the Core Policies of the
          First Amendment Requires That This Court
          Apply the Rigorous Standards of Scrutiny
          Normally Applicable to Content-Based
          Restrictions...............................      

IV.  PLAINTIFFS ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THEIR CLAIM
     THAT THE ACT IS UNCONSTITUTIONALLY VAGUE........      

     A.   The Terms "Indecent" and "Patently Offensive
          As Measured By Contemporary Community
          Standards" Are Unconstitutionally Vague....      

     B.   The Act's Defenses Are Unconstitutionally
          Vague......................................      

V.   THE IRREPARABLE HARM TO PLAINTIFFS, THEIR
     MEMBERS, AND THEIR SUBSCRIBERS, PATRONS, AND
     CUSTOMERS FAR OUTWEIGHS ANY HARM TO THE 
     GOVERNMENT IF AN INJUNCTION ISSUES, AND THE
     PUBLIC INTEREST FAVORS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF........      

CONCLUSION...........................................      


                         Introduction
          Plaintiffs represent a broad range of individuals
and entities from the computer and communications industries
and the general public who provide most of the access to the
Internet, and a substantial volume of the communications
carried on the Internet and other interactive computer
systems./*1  Plaintiffs challenge provisions of the
Communications Decency Act of 1996 (the "CDA" or "Act")/*2
that criminalize constitutionally protected communications
among the adult population whenever those communications
might be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" for
minors.  The challenged provisions violate the bedrock First
Amendment principle that government cannot "reduce the adult
population . . . to reading only what is fit for children." 
Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383 (1957).
                    STATEMENT OF THE CASE
          Four points are critical in this case.  First, the
Internet, and "cyberspace" generally, is an entirely new
communications medium that differs from other media in
crucial respects:  it is global, it is decentralized, it
gives ordinary citizens unparalleled ability to communicate
to and with others on a scale never before possible, and it
is unobtrusive, because users access only the communications
they affirmatively request.  It therefore merits the highest
level of First Amendment protection.  Second, the provisions
of the Act that are the subject of this challenge -- Section
502(2), 47 U.S.C.   223(d), and Section 502(1), 47 U.S.C.
  223(a)(1)(B) -- criminalize an enormous quantity of speech,
all of which is constitutionally protected for adults, and
apply to a vast and diverse range of speakers and speech
activities.  Third, because of the way the Internet works,
the Act effectively bans the vast majority of that speech,
and severely burdens the rest.  Thus, in nearly every
application, the challenged provisions abridge the First
Amendment rights of adults.  Fourth, effective methods exist
to protect minors from online speech that is inappropriate
for them, methods that do not deny adult access to that
speech.

     A.   The Internet, And "Cyberspace" Generally, Is
          A Unique Medium Of Communication./*3

          Creation of the Internet and the Development of
          Cyberspace

          The Internet is not a physical or tangible entity. 
It is a giant network which interconnects innumerable smaller
groups of linked computer networks:  a network of
networks./*4  This amalgam of computers and computer
networks is a decentralized, unrestricted global medium of
communications -- or "cyberspace" -- linking individuals,
institutions, corporations, and governments around the world. 
Anyone with access to the Internet can use it to exchange
ideas, research, software, poetry, images, literature, sound,
or electronic mail.  Communication can occur virtually
instantaneously, and can be directed to specific individuals,
broader groups, or the world as a whole.
          No entity -- academic, corporate, governmental, or
non-profit -- controls the Internet./*5  It exists and
functions solely because hundreds of thousands of computer
operators and computer networks independently decided to use
a common data transfer protocol to exchange information with
other computers (which in turn exchange information with
still other computers).  Although the nature of the Internet
makes it impossible to determine its size, it is estimated
that over 5,000,000 host computers worldwide are linked to
the Internet, and that over 50 million individuals around the
world access this medium.  Two hundred million users are
expected by the year 1999./*6  There is no centralized
storage location, control point, or communications channel
for the Internet.  It would be impossible for any single
entity to regulate the information conveyed on the
Internet./*7

             How Individuals Access the Internet
          There are two common methods to establish an actual
physical link to the Internet.  First, individuals can use a
computer or computer terminal that is directly connected to a
computer network that is itself connected to the Internet. 
Second, individuals can use "personal computers" with
"modems" to connect over a telephone line to a larger
computer or computer network that is itself connected to the
Internet./*8
          Students, faculty, researchers, and others
affiliated with most of colleges and universities in the
United States can access the Internet through computers
located in campus libraries, offices, computer centers and
dormitories.  Such access, considered vital to the
educational process, enables students and professors to use
information and content provided by the college or university
itself, and to reach the vast research resources available on
the Internet worldwide./*9  Similarly, many employers link
their office computer networks, and provide their employees
access to the Internet, to enable them to exchange
information and ideas with others in their fields.  Many
communities have established "free-nets" or community
networks to provide citizens a free or low-cost local
Internet link (and provide local-oriented content and
discussion groups) using computers available in community
buildings.  Libraries also often offer computers linked to
the Internet at no cost to the individual user./*10  A
growing number of "computer coffee shops" offer connection to
the Internet at a modest fee.
          Individuals can also access the Internet through
"Internet service providers."  Some providers (including the
members of plaintiff Commercial Internet Exchange
Association) are commercial entities who charge a modest
monthly or hourly fee./*11  Others (such as the
International Internet Association) are non-profit
organizations offering free or low-cost access.
          Access is also available through major national
commercial "online services" such as America Online, Apple's
eWorld, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, or Prodigy.  These
online services offer nationwide computer networks (so that
subscribers can dial-in to a local telephone number).  In
addition to allowing access to extensive and well-organized
content within each proprietary network, the services allow
subscribers to link to the much larger Internet resources. 
Full access to the online service (including the Internet)
can be obtained for modest fees.  The major commercial online
services have almost twelve million individual subscribers
across the United States./*12
          Finally, with an investment of as little as
$2,000.00 and the cost of a telephone line, individuals, non-
profit organizations, advocacy groups, and businesses can
offer their own dial-in computer "bulletin board systems" or
"BBSs" to exchange ideas and information.  BBSs range from
single computers allowing only one user at a time to multiple
linked computers allowing multiple simultaneous users.  Some
BBS systems charge a nominal fee, while many others are free. 
In part because the Internet is an unregulated "network of
networks" with literally millions of access points and tens
of millions of users, many users access the Internet
anonymously or through a method that does not allow for clear
identification by a remote content provider./*13

           Methods to Communicate Over the Internet
          Once an individual has access to the Internet,
there are a wide variety of different methods of
communication and information exchange over the network. 
Most networks can be used to transmit text, data, computer
programs, sound, or visual images.
               One-to-one messaging.  The simplest method of
     communication is via "e-mail," which allows an
     individual to transmit a message to specific
     individuals./*14

               One-to-many messaging.  The Internet also
     contains thousands of automatic mailing list services
     (such as "listserv"), which allow a subscriber to
     transmit messages on a given topic that the listserv
     automatically forwards (via e-mail) to every other
     subscriber.  This service enables subscribers to keep
     abreast of developments or events in a particular
     subject area./*15

               Distributed message databases.  Distributed
     message databases, such as "USENET newsgroups," are open
     discussions on particular topics.  Users need not
     subscribe in advance.  A message posted to a newsgroup
     is automatically forwarded to all computers that furnish
     access to the newsgroups (but not to any individual
     users).  Messages are temporarily stored on each
     receiving computer where they are available for review
     and response.  There are newsgroups on more than 1,500
     subjects.  In 1994, approximately 70,000 messages were
     posted to newsgroups daily, and were distributed to
     approximately 190,000 participating computers./*16

               Real time communication.  Individuals can
     engage in an immediate dialog -- in "real time" -- with
     other individuals on the Internet.  In its simplest
     forms, "talk" allows one-to-one communications and
     "Internet Relay Chat" allows an individual to send a
     message that almost immediately appears on other
     individuals' computer screens.  Commercial online
     services such as America Online, CompuServe, eWorld, the
     Microsoft Network, and Prodigy have their own "chat"
     systems allowing their members to converse./*17

               Real time remote computer utilization. 
     "Telnet" can be used to access remote computers. 
     Students can use telnet to connect to a remote library's
     online card catalog.  Individuals can link via telnet to
     a computer to interact directly with other users linked
     to the same computer.  Content accessed via telnet is
     often created only at the time of the communication and
     occurs in "real time."/*18

               Remote information retrieval.  The final major
     category is the search for and retrieval of information
     located on remote computers, through means such as the
     "World Wide Web."/*19  Programs that "browse" the
     Web can display documents containing text, images, and
     sound, as well as "links" to other types of information
     or resources.  Using these "hyperlinks," an individual
     can "click" using a computer mouse on the description of
     the resource and be immediately connected to the
     resource itself./*20

          With all of these methods of communicating in
cyberspace (except point-to-point mail), no information flows
through cyberspace to a particular individual unless the
individual requests the information./*21  Listservs,
newsgroups, chat lines, telnet, ftp, gopher and the World
Wide Web all require an affirmative request prior to an
individual's receiving online information./*22  When an
individual makes such a request, it is usually clear what
type of content will be delivered.
          Most transmissions of content from specific sites
on the Internet are in response to recipients' requests that
could not have been anticipated more than a few moments
earlier.  Because information is located on millions of
computers around the world, with no central organization or
control, a user cannot possibly know which computers might
have useful information until starting a search, and while
searching may have no knowledge of where the computers
accessed are physically located./*23  Thus, there is no
way for a user to pre-register with every computer that
potentially might contain useful content on a particular
topic (and equally impossible for those content sites to
maintain and continually update lists of registered users). 
Moreover, when exploring a topic, an individual might access
dozens of newsgroups, telnet computers, and ftp, gopher, and
Web sites around the world in a matter of minutes.  If a user
must request access from content providers (and prove he or
she is not a minor) prior to actually viewing the
information, as the Act requires, the Internet would lose
much of its value as a dynamic and instantaneous research
tool./*24

     B.   The Act Applies To A Very Broad Category Of
          Protected Speech, And To A Diverse Range Of
          Speakers And Communicative Activities.

          Plaintiffs are not challenging the Act to the
extent it prohibits speech that is unprotected by the First
Amendment -- including obscenity, see Miller v. California,
413 U.S. 15 (1973), and child pornography, New York v.
Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982)./*25  Nor do plaintiffs
challenge the Act's prohibition of communications made with
the intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass the
recipient, or provisions that prohibit communications
designed to entice or lure minors into illegal activity. 
See, e.g., 47 U.S.C.   223(a)(1)(A),(C),(D),(E).  Those
communications are not constitutionally protected even for
adults.  But subsections 223(a) and (d) enact sweeping
restrictions on speech that is constitutionally protected for
adults.  Indeed, the Act directly affects an extraordinarily
broad category of speech, a massive volume of speech, and an
extremely diverse range of speakers and speech activities.
          Subsection (a).  The Act makes it a felony,
punishable by two years in prison, for a person to knowingly
transmit by "telecommunications device"/*26 "any comment,
request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication
which is . . . indecent" to a person whom the transmitter
knows is under 18.  47 U.S.C.   223(a)(1)(B)./*27  This
provision on its face prohibits any communications containing
any indecent material whenever one participant knows another
participant is under 18, and would make it illegal for a
University library to transmit the text of Lady Chatterly's
Lover or George Carlin's satirical "Seven Dirty Words"
monologue to a portion of the University's freshman class,
because those works have been judged "indecent."/*28
          Subsection (d).  Subsection (d) is even more
sweeping.  The provision makes it a felony, punishable by two
years in prison, for anyone to knowingly use an "interactive
computer service"/*29 to "display in a manner available
to" a person under 18:
          any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image,
          or other communication that, in context, depicts or
          describes, in terms patently offensive as measured
          by contemporary community standards, sexual or
          excretory activities or organs[.]
  223(d)(1)(B) (emphasis added)./*30
          This "display" prohibition is truly breathtaking in
scope.  Unlike the standard for obscenity, the Act's
prohibition of "indecent" or "patently offensive" material is
not restricted to materials with "prurient appeal."  See
Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24, (1973).  To the
contrary, while "[p]rurient appeal is an element of the
obscene, . . . the normal definition of `indecent' merely
refers to nonconformance with accepted standards of
morality."  FCC v. Pacifica Found., 438 U.S. 726, 740 (1978)
(footnote omitted).  Nor are subsections (a) or (d) limited
to material that lacks serious literary, artistic, political
or scientific value./*31      The Act plainly covers the
so-called "seven dirty words," for those very words have been
found "indecent" and "patently offensive" by the Supreme
Court in Pacifica,/*32 and the Conference Report makes
clear that Congress was adopting Pacifica./*33 
Similarly, Senator Exon, the Act's principal sponsor,
confirmed that the prohibition would apply to Playboy
magazine. 141 Cong. Rec. S8330 (June 14, 1995) (Sen.
Exon)./*34
          Not surprisingly given the enormous quantity and
diversity of information it carries, cyberspace contains a
substantial amount of expression that might be deemed
"indecent" or "patently offensive" for younger
children./*35  This material includes serious works of
fiction (containing descriptions of sexual conduct or vulgar
language),/*36 use of profanity in casual conversations
via e-mail, reproductions of artwork containing nudity or
sexually explicit images, medical treatises (containing
depictions or descriptions relating to sexually transmitted
diseases and medical conditions), robust political or public
policy debates containing vulgar language or expletives, and
serious discussions of sexuality and relationships.  See
Action for Children's Television v. FCC, 852 F.2d 1332, 1340
(D.C. Cir. 1988)("ACT I"); Action for Children's Television
v. FCC, 932 F.2d 1504, 1508 (D.C. Cir. 1991) ("ACT II"),
cert. denied, 503 U.S. 913 (1992).  This type of information
is an important part of the Internet materials accessible by
researchers, members of the academic community and the
public./*37 
          Indeed, in this litigation the government has cited
and relied upon the "Rimm" study to illustrate the types of
materials with which the Act is concerned./*38  That
study, which was published in the Georgetown Law Journal,
itself contains descriptions that could be deemed indecent or
patently offensive within the meaning of the Act.  See Deft
ACLU Br. Ex. 9 at pp. 1880-1882.  The text of that study is
maintained online by the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh,
whose Director is understandably concerned with the "risk of
criminal prosecution under the Act."/*39  It may now be a
felony to post or maintain online the very materials the
government has relied on in this litigation./*40  
          In addition to criminalizing a broad category of
speech, the Act subjects an unusually broad category of
speakers to the risk of imprisonment and substantial fines. 
Nearly every online user and service provider will of
necessity employ either a "telecommunications device" or an
"interactive computer service," or both.  Almost all of the
tens of millions of users of the Internet are "content
providers."  By the very nature of the Internet, most
material that is stored in a database or made part of a
bulletin board can be accessed by everyone, and is ipso facto
"display[ed] in a manner available to" persons under
18./*41  Thus, the Act regulates the activity of
virtually everyone who uses the Internet or cyberspace.

     C.   The Defenses Provided In The Act Do Not Provide A
          Technologically or Economically Feasible Means For
          Most Internet Speakers To Shield Themselves From
          Liability.

          Recognizing that the First Amendment forbids a flat
prohibition of indecency on the scale imposed by subsections
(a) and (d),/*42 Congress sought to narrow the sweeping
effect of the Act by providing a defense to a criminal
prosecution under (a)(1)(B) or (d), or under (a)(2) for use
of a facility for an activity under (a)(1)(B), if the
defendant

          (A)  has taken, in good faith, reasonable,
          effective, and appropriate actions under the
          circumstances to restrict or prevent access by
          minors to a communication specified in such
          subsections, which may involve any appropriate
          measures to restrict minors from such
          communications, including any method which is
          feasible under available technology; or

          (B)  has restricted access to such communication by
          requiring use of a verified credit card, debit
          account, adult access code, or adult personal
          identification number.

47 U.S.C.   223(e)(5)).  
          These "defenses," which the Act's sponsors borrowed
directly from "dial-a-porn" legislation, were intended to
provide a means to preserve access for adults while denying
access to minors.  Thus, the clear premise of the Act was the
assumption that the "defenses" that worked in the dial-a-porn
context would work in cyberspace, and that, for that reason,
the Act would not effectively ban constitutionally protected
indecent speech between adults.
          That premise is flatly incorrect.  Fee-based
content providers -- who typically require credit card
payment for users' access to their speech -- may be able to
avail themselves of the "verified credit card" defense
allowed by the Act./*43  But for content providers who
speak to the public at large, and do not charge for access to
their speech, there is no practical way the speaker can
control who can access the message.  Thus, for a huge
quantity of speech on the Internet, it is impossible for the
speaker to prevent the speech from being "display[ed] in a
manner available to a person under 18."  47 U.S.C.
  223(2)(d)(1)(B)./*44
          The primary methods used to access information on
the Internet simply do not permit individual or non-
commercial content providers to control access to their
speech.  None of the major methods of accessing information
-- including electronic mail, listservs, newsgroups, chat
lines, telnet, and the World Wide Web -- have the ability to
track the millions of individuals who access the Internet and
screen out those that are under 18./*45  With USENET
newsgroups, for example, once a content provider posts a
message to a newsgroup, that message is automatically
distributed to over 190,000 computers around the world, and
the individual content provider has no ability whatsoever to
control who is permitted to access the content on those
computers./*46  Even larger organizations that provide
content on the Internet cannot practically or economically
track the millions of Internet users to determine whether
those users are minors or adults./*47  Such a requirement
would effectively compel these content providers to refrain
completely from posting any material that could be deemed
"indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors./*48
          Although password-required access to content is
possible (and is used in some circumstances),/*49  the
password system envisioned by the Act would effectively
remove from public access an enormous volume of valuable
content on the Internet, and would, in large part, reduce the
information available to adults on the Internet to that
deemed suitable for minors./*50
          Because of the infeasibility of the statutory
defenses, the Act effectively bans an entire category of
constitutionally protected speech among adults.  For this
reason, the Act will actually frustrate, rather than further,
the Congressional policy goals.  The Act specifies that "[i]t
is the policy of the United States . . . to promote the
continued development of the Internet and other interactive
computer services . . .  to preserve the vibrant and
competitive free market that presently exists for the
Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered
by Federal or State regulation."  47 U.S.C.   230.  Instead
of a free, vibrant and unfettered market, cyberspace will be
a cramped and highly regulated market, where all speakers
will have to choose their words with great care.
     D.   There Are Existing Ways To Protect Minors
          From Speech That Would Be Inappropriate For
          Them, That Do Not Ban Or Burden Speech To
          Adults.
          The online medium offers the recipients of
information a degree of control unmatched in any other
medium.  Not only can users affirmatively select the content
of materials they view based on the subject matter of the
particular service or the information contained in the
headline or subject line, but there are also numerous -- and
expanding -- methods for users to screen and block incoming
materials they choose not to receive.
          Commercial online services such as America Online,
CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, and Prodigy offer
technologies that allow parents to block their children's
access to inappropriate content./*51  These online
services, for example, include a feature that allows parents
to prevent their children from accessing interactive
discussion forums (chat rooms).  They also offer parents the
ability to block access to some or all of the Internet
(including the World Wide Web and USENET newsgroups) based on
keywords, subject matter, or specific newsgroups.
          A variety of software providers have developed
applications to use in conjunction with commercial online
services, while others are designed for direct Internet
access.  SurfWatch, for example, allows parents to block
access to USENET newsgroups, World Wide Web, gopher, and ftp
sites with sexually explicit content./*52  The service
automatically updates the list of blocked sites, without any
intervention required from the user./*53  Similarly,
Cyber Patrol blocks access to locations and content on the
Internet based both on a list of identified sites and on a
scan for certain key words suggesting sexual content./*54 
Certain of these screening programs can be set to keep a log
of all activity that occurs on the computer, allowing parents
to monitor a child's use.  All of these programs contain
safeguards to prevent children from circumventing the
blocking software./*55
          User-based content control programs provide parents
and others flexibility to select the kinds of content to be
screened.  For example, Cyber Patrol allows parents to choose
to screen out some or all of 12 separate categories of
content./*56  Moreover, these programs allow parents to
modify the screening criteria as their young children mature
into teenagers and young adults.
          This screening technology is available at little or
no cost to parents and other computer users.  Online services
make their internal parental control systems, as well as
Cyber Patrol, Surfwatch, and similar software, available to
parents at no additional charge./*57  Microsystems
Software, Inc. offers a version of Cyber Patrol that anyone
can obtain for free over the Internet./*58  Retail
versions of this type of blocking software costs between
$20.00 and $50.00./*59
          Additionally, the World Wide Web Consortium/*60
has promulgated a communications standard to facilitate this
type of user-based blocking.  The Platform for Internet
Content Selection ("PICS") defines the precise method by
which content ratings can be transmitted to user-based
blocking software./*61  The PICS standard allows all
user-based blocking software to be compatible, and to utilize
common databases of content ratings.  Under the PICS
standard, any third party organization (such as a church,
parents' organization, or pediatric association) can rate
Internet content according to that organization's own values,
and those ratings can be accessed by user-based blocking
software.  The PICS standard has been implemented in blocking
software such as Surfwatch and Cyber Patrol,/*62 and
Cyber Patrol has made its ratings available on the Internet
in a PICS-compatible database.  With PICS, parents will be
able to further tailor the content available to their
children according to the parents' own values.
                           ARGUMENT
          The requirements for issuance of a preliminary
injunction are likelihood of success on the merits and
irreparable injury if an injunction does not issue.  Bradley
v. Pittsburgh Bd. of Educ., 910 F.2d 1172, 1175 (3d Cir.
1990).  The court must also consider the public interest. 
Id.  This test is easily met here.  As the accompanying
declarations show, the Act is currently causing irreparable
injury to the First Amendment rights of plaintiffs, their
members, and their subscribers, patrons, and customers, while
also causing irreparable injury to the public interest in
free expression, and particularly to the First Amendment
right of adults to receive expression that is indisputably
protected for them.  Plaintiffs will now show that governing
Supreme Court precedent virtually assures their ultimate
success on the merits.

I.   THE ACT EFFECTIVELY BANS AN ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF SPEECH
     THAT IS CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED FOR ADULTS, AND THE
     SUPREME COURT HAS REPEATEDLY HELD THAT GOVERNMENT CANNOT
     REDUCE THE ADULT POPULATION TO READING AND VIEWING ONLY
     WHAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN.

     A.   The Act's Content-Based Restrictions On Indecent
          Speech Are Subject To Strict Scrutiny, And Cannot
          Be Upheld Unless the Government Proves That the
          Restrictions Materially Advance a Compelling
          Interest In the Least Restrictive Way, And Proves
          That the Benefit To Be Gained From the Restrictions
          Outweighs And Does Not Unduly Burden the First
          Amendment Rights Of Adults.
          "At the heart of the First Amendment lies the
principle that each person should decide for him or herself
the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration,
and adherence.  Our political system and cultural life rest
upon this ideal."  Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC,
114 S.Ct. 2445, 2458 (1994).  For this reason, "the First
Amendment . . . does not countenance governmental control
over the content of messages expressed by private
individuals," and courts must "apply the most exacting
scrutiny to regulations that suppress, disadvantage, or
impose differential burdens upon speech because of its
content."  Id. at 2458-59.  Accord Simon & Schuster v. New
York Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 117 (1991).
          The Act is such a law.  It singles out for
suppression words and images that describe or depict sexual
or excretory activity in a manner deemed "indecent" or
"patently offensive" for persons under 18.  Thus, the Act is
subject to the most exacting First Amendment scrutiny.  It
must be struck down unless the government demonstrates it
serves a compelling interest, and that it does so "by
narrowly drawn regulations designed to serve those interests
without unnecessarily interfering with First Amendment
freedoms."  Sable Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126
(1989).
          The Supreme Court has foreclosed any argument that
so-called "indecent" expression should be subject to a less
exacting standard of review.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 126.  Noting
that "[s]exual expression which is indecent but not obscene
is protected by the First Amendment," the Court unanimously
held that an act of Congress prohibiting the transmission of
indecent messages over telephone lines for commercial
purposes was subject to, and could not survive, strict
scrutiny.  Id.  This Circuit has likewise held that laws
regulating so-called "indecent" expression must receive the
most exacting First Amendment scrutiny.  Fabulous Assoc.
Inc., v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm., 896 F.2d 780, 784-85
(3d Cir. 1990).
          Strict scrutiny is amply justified because the
category of "indecency" sweeps in vast quantities of valuable
-- though often controversial or unsettling -- expression. 
The Act prohibits the transmission of serious works of
fiction or drama that treat sexual themes with any degree of
explicitness.  It likewise prohibits constitutionally
protected profanity, whether in robust political debate, e.g.
Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971) ("Fuck the draft"),
in biting social criticism, e.g. Hustler Magazine v. Falwell,
485 U.S. 46, 48 (1988) (vulgar satire of religious figure
depicting "drunken incestuous rendezvous with his mother in
an outhouse"), or in casual, private conversations.  And the
Act also encompasses works of science and medicine, or public
health information dealing with sex.
          It is precisely because such expression may be
provocative, or even offensive, that full First Amendment
protection is necessary.  "[P]ersons who voice acceptable
viewpoints or who are able to articulate their goals and
interests in terms which are either shared or accepted as
legitimate by those who shape official policy are seldom in
need of the [First] Amendment's support.  It is when we must
face the unpopular or distasteful expression that the concept
of free speech needs its most vigilant protection."  Aiello
v. City of Wilmington, Del., 623 F.2d 845, 859 (3d Cir. 1980)
(Sloviter, J., concurring in part); see also Abrams v. United
States, 250 U.S. 616, 630 (1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting,
joined by Brandeis, J.).  
          Application of strict First Amendment scrutiny to
"indecency" regulations poses a particular challenge because
such expression is simultaneously valuable (and protected)
for an adult audience and potentially harmful (and thus
regulable) for children.  But one thing is clear:  government
may not resolve this tension by simply suppressing indecent
speech altogether in order to protect children.  Indeed, it
is bedrock First Amendment law that "government may not
`reduce the adult population . . . to . . . only what is fit
for children.'"/*63  "The level of discourse reaching a
mailbox simply cannot be limited to that which would be
suitable for a sandbox," and this is so "regardless of the
strength of the government's interest" in protecting
children.  Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60,
74-75 (1983) (emphasis added).  It is settled that government
may not constitutionally "quarantin[e] the general reading
public against books not too rugged for grown men and women
in order to shield juvenile innocence."  Butler, 352 U.S. at
383.  A federal statute is unconstitutional if it has the
"effect of limiting the content of adult [communications] to
that which is suitable for children."  Sable, 492 U.S. at 131
(emphasis added)./*64 
          Thus, in the "indecency" context it is particularly
important that strict scrutiny not be reduced to a
mechanical, formalistic inquiry into whether government's
posited interest is compelling, and its chosen means are
narrowly tailored.  Rather, strict scrutiny demands that "the
benefit gained [by a content-based restriction] must outweigh
the loss of constitutionally protected rights."  Elrod v.
Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 363 (1976).  Accord Burns v. County of
Cambria, Pa., 971 F.2d 1015, 1021 (3d Cir. 1992), cert.
denied, 506 U.S. 1081 (1993).  A reviewing court must
undertake a "balancing process," Sable, 492 U.S. at 127
(Scalia, J., concurring), to determine whether the benefits
to children of a restriction on indecency are sufficient to
outweigh the loss of adults' constitutional rights.  Accord
Fabulous Assoc., 896 F.2d at 787-88.  See also Bolger 463
U.S. at 73./*65  Simply put, government may not "burn the
house to roast the pig."  Butler, 352 U.S. at 383; Sable, 492
U.S. at 127.
          Applying these principles, no court has ever upheld
an indecency regulation that on its face, or in its practical
application, banned "indecency" from any medium.  In Sable, a
unanimous Supreme Court struck down a ban on telephone
indecency, notwithstanding that "enterprising youngsters
could and would evade" less restrictive regulatory mechanisms
which would have better protected adults' rights.  Sable 492
U.S. at 128.  In Bolger, the Court struck down a ban on mail
advertisements for contraceptives for the same reason.  463
U.S. at 73.  In Butler, the Court invalidated a conviction
for distributing indecent publications for the same reason. 
352 U.S. at 381.  Indecency regulations have been upheld only
when government has proven that the regulation will provide
substantial protection for children, while ensuring that
adults have continued access to expression that is
constitutionally protected for them.  See Ginsberg v. New
York, 390 U.S. 629, 634-35 (1968) (upholding prohibition or
sale of material harmful to minors under 17 because
prohibition did not bar sale to persons over 17).
          As we will show, a straightforward application of
these settled principles invalidates the Act, for two
reasons.  First, the burden imposed by the Act's restrictions
on indecency is so severe in relation to the marginal gains
in protecting minors achieved by the law that it must be
struck down.  Second, the government cannot meet its heavy
burden of proving that the Act directly advances a compelling
interest in the least restrictive way.

     B.   The Challenged Provisions Of The Act Violate The
          Principles Established In Butler, Bolger And Sable
          That Adults Cannot Be Reduced To Reading And
          Viewing Only What Is Appropriate For Children.

          Like the laws struck down in Butler, Bolger, Sable
and Fabulous Assoc., the Act must be invalidated because it
denies the millions of adults who use the Internet access to
constitutionally protected expression in order to ensure that
minors are not exposed to indecency.  Subsection (d) in
particular criminalizes dissemination of "indecency" on the
Internet in any manner that will result in its being
"available" to minors.  Almost all "indecent" communication
disseminated on the Internet will be "available" to minors
because there is no feasible way for most speakers in most
formats to limit who has access to communications they
disseminate./*66
          The only way for those speakers to ensure
compliance with the Act is to undertake the enormous effort
and expense of maintaining either a database that allows them
to screen requests for access, or individually verifying
requesters' age each time a request is received.  Individuals
and other noncommercial content providers such as libraries
and universities could not possibly afford such an
expense./*67  Furthermore, even apart from their cost,
such "screening" methods simply cannot work with respect to
several ways of communicating on the Internet, including
listservs and newsgroups./*68  Thus, the Act leaves the
majority of Internet content providers with only one choice:
to avoid the risk of criminal prosecution and incarceration,
they must self-censor all expression that might be deemed
"indecent" or "patently offensive."  This is, for all
practical purposes, a ban of "indecency" on the Internet.
          The suppressive effect of this ban is truly
staggering.  As demonstrated, the Act's prohibitions sweep in
a vast quantity of valuable, fully protected expression.  And
those prohibitions apply to tens of millions of Internet
users.  Thus, the Act is entirely unlike prior indecency
laws, which targeted narrow and well-defined types of speech
and particular forms of communication (such as dial-a-porn). 
Congress has, in effect, prohibited the public communication
of indecency.  It is as if Congress had banned indecent
speech in public parks or squares, or had banned the
circulation of publications containing indecency.  At bottom,
the Act seems to contemplate an entirely restructured, indeed
bifurcated, Internet -- one Internet accessible to adults,
which will contain indecent materials, and an entirely
separate Internet accessible to children, which will be
scrubbed of indecent material.  It postulates an entirely
imaginary world that does not exist and cannot be created.
          It is no answer that the Act provides "defenses" to
criminal prosecution for those who make good faith,
reasonable efforts to block access by minors.  The plain fact
is that those defenses cannot be utilized by the vast
majority of speakers to whom the Act applies.  Only a small
subset of Internet speakers  -- those who sell information
through credit cards or other mechanisms, or who can
otherwise afford the enormous cost of screening users
requesting access -- will have even the potential to take
advantage of the defenses.  And the Act would severely burden
the speech of those speakers.
          Even if these "defenses" were available to most
content providers -- and they are not -- they would not begin
to cure the Act's constitutional infirmity.  The Act does no
more than provide Internet speakers the opportunity to
convince a jury in a criminal case that they have acted
"reasonably" and in "good faith" and have taken "effective"
actions to prevent minors from accessing "indecent" or
"patently offensive" communications.  That hardly provides a
meaningful check on the risk that speakers will self-censor
valuable expression.  By their nature, these defenses provide
no guidance as to the line between lawful and unlawful
expression; they invite -- indeed they require -- ad hoc,
case-by-case judgments.  "It is fictional to believe that
anything less than extensive adjudications, under the impact
of a variety of factual situations, will be required to
clarify their meaning."  Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360,
378 (1964).  "[T]hose affected by a statute are entitled to
be free of the burdens of defending prosecutions, however
expeditious, aimed at hammering out the structure of the
statute piecemeal."  Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 491
(1965).  The Act will certainly deter would-be speakers from
disseminating potentially indecent speech "because of doubt
whether [the defense] can be proved in court or fear of the
expense of having to do so."  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
376 U.S. 254, 279 (1964) (fear of civil liability).  Such a
risk is even more chilling here because potential speakers
face not merely civil liability but the stigma of criminal
conviction and severe criminal sanctions.
          Thus, the Act contains precisely the fatal flaw
that led to invalidation of the indecency regulations at
issue in Sable, Bolger, and Butler:  in an attempt to
preclude minors from access to indecent speech, Congress has
effectively denied adults access to that speech as well. 
Upholding the Act's suppression of adult dissemination and
receipt of "indecent" or "patently offensive" speech would be
unprecedented.  No court has ever held, in the context of any
medium, that a ban on the transmission of indecent
communications to adults satisfies this exacting standard. 
This Court should not endorse such an unprecedented intrusion
on First Amendment rights.

     C.   The Act Also Violates The First Amendment Because
          The Government Cannot Prove That It Materially
          Advances A Compelling Interest In The Least
          Restrictive Manner.
          The Act also violates the First Amendment
irrespective of whether, in practical effect, it is a ban of
the kind struck down in Sable.  There is no doubt the Act
will cause self-censorship of vast quantities of speech by
those who simply cannot bring themselves within the Act's
defenses, and will impose heavy financial burdens on speakers
who can.  These burdens will certainly inhibit speech, and
thus drastically alter the content of expression on the
Internet.  Faced with the substantial cost and ongoing
administrative burdens imposed by the Act's "defenses," most
speakers will simply choose not to communicate anything
arguably "indecent."/*69  The Supreme Court has made
clear that "[a] law is presumptively inconsistent with the
First Amendment if it imposes a financial burden on speakers
because of the content of their speech."  Simon & Schuster,
502 U.S. at 115 (emphasis added)./*70  The government
must thus demonstrate a compelling need for imposing those
burdens, and show that its interests could not be served by
less drastic alternatives.  It cannot make that showing here.
          In the abstract, the government has a compelling
interest in protecting minors from communications harmful to
their psychological and moral development.  The government
cannot, however, simply "posit the existence of" a problem to
be cured; it "must demonstrate that the recited harms [here
none were recited] are real, not merely conjectural, and that
the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct
and material way."  Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2470 (emphasis
added).  And the government also "bears the burden of showing
that the remedy it has adopted does not 'burden substantially
more speech than is necessary to further the government's
legitimate interests.'"  Id. (quoting Ward, 491 U.S. at 799).
          That showing cannot be made on the basis of the
legislative record here.  Congress made no findings regarding
the provisions at issue, and compiled no empirical record
demonstrating either their necessity or the basis for their
constitutionality./*71  Leahy Dec.    9, 19, 28, Tab 24. 
Just as in Sable,/*72 Congress failed to examine how
difficult it is for minors to access the indecent material
restricted by the Act; how many minors, and of what ages,
actually have accessed such material; the likely
effectiveness of the measures Congress adopted in preventing
access; the impact of those measures on speech protected by
the First Amendment; the effectiveness of alternatives to the
challenged provisions; and, in general, the extent to which
the challenged provisions will materially further Congress'
goal without abridging the First Amendment rights of adults. 
Cf. Sable, 492 U.S. at 129-30.  The novelty and complexity of
cyberspace makes the absence of careful factual inquiry
particularly egregious.  Congress appears not to have
examined how online communications work; which types of
online communications present a substantial risk for minors,
and whether the communications about which Congress was
concerned are primarily obscene or nonobscene, commercial or
noncommercial, text or visual images; whether the "defenses"
Congress established could, as a practical matter, be
utilized; the ease or difficulty with which parents can
control their children's online access; and the possibility
that existing legal prohibitions suffice to address the
concerns underlying the challenged provisions.  Instead, as
the government concedes, "Congress [did] no more than
incorporate the standards for blocking access to 'dial-a-
porn' messages'" (see Deft ACLU Br. at 29-30), without even
considering whether those standards can be grafted on to the
dramatically different, infinitely more complex, online
computer medium.
          This failure to make a considered judgment as to
the need, efficacy, and ramifications of the law has a direct
impact on this Court's examination of the Act's
constitutionality.   Without findings, for example, the Court
can have no clear sense of what Congress perceived as the
precise harm to be remedied or of the precise goals Congress
had in mind in enacting the challenged provisions.  Thus,
there is nothing to which the government can point in the
record before Congress to meet its burden.
          Furthermore, far from advancing the government's
interest "in a direct and material way," the Act "provides
only the most limited incremental support for the interest
asserted."  See Bolger, 463 U.S. at 73.  That is so for
several reasons.  First, there is no reason to think the
government's interest will be inadequately served by
"vigorously enforc[ing]" laws already on the books, which ban
obscenity, child pornography, enticement of minors, and
harassment.  Riley v. National Fed'n. of the Blind, 487 U.S.
781, 800 (1988); accord FCC v. League of Women Voters, 468
U.S. 364, 398 (1984) (law is not narrowly tailored if
government's goal is already served by "other regulatory
means that intrude far less drastically upon [First
Amendment] rights"); Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens For a
Better Environment, 444 U.S. 620, 637 & n.11 (1980)
(enforcement of existing laws against fraud would
sufficiently serve purported governmental objective,
therefore new law is not narrowly tailored).  The expression
prohibited by these other laws was plainly Congress' core
concern, and that expression can be fully regulated without
extending the Act's prohibition to "indecent" communications.
          Second, there are existing methods that are far
more effective in limiting a minor's access to "indecent" or
"patently offensive" online communications, without impeding
adult access to expression that is fully protected as to
them.  Because the Internet is a global network with millions
of users, speaker-based content restrictions cannot
effectively control the availability of materials.  The only
effective way to protect children from inappropriate online
material is through recipient-based strategies . . . by
encouraging user-based tools that empower parents to control
their children's online activities based on the parents'
views of what is appropriate for their children./*73  The
products we have described, and others like them (see
Statement of the Case, Point D), provide parents these tools,
and do so without the need for criminalizing the distribution
to adults of constitutionally protected communications. 
These approaches are most consistent with the fundamental
principle of our democracy that parents are responsible for
the well-being and upbringing of their children.  "It is
cardinal . . . that the custody, care and nurture of the
child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and
freedom include preparation for obligations the state can
neither supply nor hinder."  Prince v. Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944).  These technologies
put the responsibility for making choices about minors'
access to communications that might be deemed harmful or
offensive to them precisely "where our society has
traditionally placed it--on the shoulders of the parent." 
Fabulous Assoc., 896 F.2d at 788 (citing Bolger, 462 U.S. at
73-74).
          That these screening alternatives are not entirely
foolproof does not diminish their value.  As the Court held
in Sable, "the desire to prevent 'a few of the most
enterprising and disobedient young people,'" from securing
access to such messages [is not] adequate justification for a
statutory provision that ha[s] 'the invalid effect of
limiting the content of adult telephone conversations to that
which is suitable for children.'"  Fabulous Assoc., 896 F.2d
at 788 (quoting Sable, 492 U.S. at 131.)  Parental discretion
and control is the "preferred method of dealing with such
[offensive] material."  Id. (citing Bolger, 463 U.S. at 73-
74).
          Even with regard to broadcast, which both the Court
and Congress have acknowledged has "a uniquely pervasive
presence in the lives of American children," Congress
recognized that parental screening and blocking technologies
can protect children from inappropriate broadcast
programming, including "sexual video programming" or other
"indecent material," without a government ban on content. 
See Act,   551.  There, Congress required manufacturers to
install a so-called "V-Chip" in televisions to allow reading
of a rating system that will enable parents "easily to block
violent, sexual or other programming that they believe
harmful to their children," and authorized the FCC to develop
a recommended rating system.  Id.  Plaintiffs are not
suggesting that particular provision is constitutional.  But
in view of the fact that Congress contemporaneously
determined that parental empowerment technologies would be an
adequate and "narrowly tailored means" to protect children
even from broadcast indecency, id., the government cannot
possibly carry its burden of showing why parental empowerment
technologies would not be adequate to protect children from
indecency in cyberspace. 
          Third, even if government had a compelling interest
in banning indecent (but not obscene) visual images from the
Internet -- and no such showing has been made -- the Act goes
much farther, and needlessly embraces messages and files
containing nothing but (electronically) written words.  The
sponsor of the Act used as his principal justification for
the Act a compilation of graphic sexually oriented visual
images.  But the Act is not so focused.  In covering a broad
range of purely "textual" indecency, the Act is apparently
unique among indecency laws.  Indeed, even in the obscenity
context, there have been few, if any, prosecutions in the
last four decades for distributing purely written material. 
See Final Report, Attorney General's Commission on
Pornography at 84 (1986).  Notwithstanding the attenuated
relationship between written words and the concerns
underlying the Act's indecency provisions, the Act's
inclusion of written words accounts for a large portion of
the protected speech that is prohibited, restricted or
chilled by the Act's sweeping restrictions.
          Fourth, at least in part because Congress did not
collect information about how online communications work and
only haphazardly reviewed the content on the Internet, the
Act does not accomplish or even significantly further the
ostensible goal of limiting access by persons under 18 to
"indecent" or "patently offensive" images.  A high percentage
of sexual content on the Internet originates outside of the
United States, and it is not possible to prevent that content
from being "available" in the United States by imposing a
source ban.  Foreign content providers may not know of, or
care about, the Act's prohibitions, and the legal and
practical ability of the U.S. Department of Justice to
enforce the Act outside the United States is questionable. 
As to the most egregious materials -- obscenity and child
pornography -- those posting such materials online are
already violating other criminal laws, and it is unlikely the
"indecency" prohibitions will deter them any more.
          All this boils down to a simple conclusion:  the
infringement on First Amendment rights imposed by the Act far
outweighs any marginal advancement of the government's
legitimate interest.  See Elrod, 427 U.S. at 361, 363.  As in
Bolger, "a restriction of this scope is more extensive than
the Constitution permits."  463 U.S. at 73.

II.  THE ACT IS SUBSTANTIALLY AND FATALLY OVERBROAD.

     A.   The Subsection (d) "Display" Prohibition Is Grossly
          Overbroad Because, in Nearly Every Application, It
          Bans or  Severely Burdens Speech That Is
          Constitutionally Protected for Adults.  

     As explained in Point I, the challenged provisions of
the Act cannot withstand strict scrutiny.  Those provisions
effectively ban a broad category of speech that is
constitutionally protected for adults, because there is no
practical way of communicating that speech via cyberspace to
adults without also making it "available to" persons under
18, in violation of the subsection (d) "display" provision,
and because the means of segregating "adult" materials
contemplated in the Act's defenses are simply impossible for
most content providers and online services.  Where the
subsection (e)(5) defenses for providers could be implemented
at all, those measures would substantially burden protected
speech by, among other things, making it practically
impossible for adult users to explore areas of the Internet
containing constitutionally protected material (and hence
impossible for content providers to reach an otherwise
willing adult audience).
          In many and perhaps most cases, the combination of
the Act's broad "display" prohibition and the infeasibility
of the statutory defenses will result in the complete removal
of constitutionally protected material from
cyberspace./*74  In the comparatively few cases in which
adult access codes or similar measures might be feasible, the
statute will result in many adult users' having reduced
access to material they would otherwise have had the ability
and desire to see.
          A statute that restricts this much protected speech
is, among other constitutional defects, substantially
overbroad.  "Far from providing the `breathing space' that
`First Amendment freedoms need . . . to survive,'" City of
Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 466 (1987) (quoting NAACP v.
Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433 (1963)), the Act indiscriminately
stifles protected speech.  Like the laws that were struck
down as overbroad in Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles
v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U.S. 569 (1987) (invalidating
ordinance banning "First Amendment activity" within airport),
and Schad v. Mount Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61 (1981) (striking down
ban on all live entertainment within town as overbroad), the
subsection (d) "display" prohibition is invalid on its face.
          This case differs from the standard overbreadth
challenge, but for reasons that make it unusually obvious
that the Act is unconstitutional.  In most overbreadth cases,
the court must balance the constitutionally permissible
applications of the statute against the impermissible ones,
in order to judge whether the claimed "`overbreadth [is] not
only [] real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to
the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.'" Massachusetts v.
Oakes, 491 U.S. 576, 595 (1989) (quoting Broadrick v.
Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 615 (1973)).   Here, it is a striking
understatement to say that subsection (d) reaches a
"substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct,"
City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. at 458 (quoting Hoffman
Estates v. The Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489,
494 (1982) and Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 359 n.8
(1983)), for all the speech the provision covers is
constitutionally protected for adults./*75  The Act is
not only "susceptible of regular application to protected
expression," Hill, 482 U.S. at 467 (emphasis added); it is
certain to be so applied.  A fortiori, it is fatally
overbroad, and therefore "facially invalid."  Id./*76

     B.   The Act Is Also Overbroad Because It Prohibits
          Speech to All Persons Under 18 Years of Age on the
          Basis of What Is Inappropriate for Young Children

          The Act is also substantially overbroad because it
bans and restricts speech that is sent or made "available" to
persons under 18, see 47 U.S.C.   223(a)(1)(B), (d)(1),
without accounting in any way for relevant differences among
the different age groups within the prohibited under-18
class.  Rather than acknowledging the vast intellectual and
emotional differences between seven-year-olds and seventeen-
year-olds, the Act erects a total prohibition based on what
"community standards" deem inappropriate for very young
children.  The constitutional defect in this "one-size-fits-
all" prohibition is particularly pronounced because of the
absence in the Act of any exemption for material with serious
literary, political, scientific, or other educational
value./*77  Because a great deal of material that might
be deemed objectionable for young children would nonetheless
be appropriate (indeed, highly valuable) for older
minors,/*78 the Act's procrustean age restrictions are
substantially overbroad.  Just as the Act indiscriminately
bans speech appropriate for adults in the name of protecting
children, it also bans speech appropriate for high school
seniors and college freshmen in the name of protecting
elementary schoolchildren./*79  This prohibition most
palpably infringes the First Amendment rights of older
minors, but it also infringes the rights of persons who would
otherwise communicate with them via the Internet./*80        
          This is not a statute dealing with a narrow type of
"adult" speech (such as the "dial-a-porn" services at issue
in Sable)./*81  Such material is arguably harmful for all
minors (albeit perhaps more harmful for young children than
for teenagers).  But the open-endedness of the Act's
prohibitions of "indecent" and "patently offensive" material,
combined with the immense diversity of material on the
Internet, ensure that the Act applies to a great deal of
material that is arguably harmful for 7-year-olds but is not
even arguably harmful for 17-year-olds.   
          Courts interpreting state harmful to minors
statutes have recognized the inappropriateness of banning
material for all minors merely because it is deemed harmful
for younger minors.  In American Booksellers v. Webb, 919
F.2d 1493, 1504 (11th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 942
(1991), the court of appeals construed a Georgia statute
restricting the display of books that on its face made no
distinctions among different age groups, to apply only to
material that lacked value for older minors.  The court
concluded that "if any reasonable minor, including a
seventeen-year-old, would find serious value," the material
was not "`harmful to minors'" for purposes of the statute.
Id. at 1504-05; see also American Booksellers Ass'n v.
Virginia, 882 F.2d at 127 ("`[I]f a work is found to have
serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value for
a legitimate minority of normal, older adolescents, then it
cannot be said to lack such value for the entire class of
juveniles taken as a whole.'") (quoting Commonwealth v.
American Booksellers Ass'n, 236 Va. 168, 372 S.E.2d 618, 624
(1988)).  Congress's failure here to account for relevant
distinctions among minors of different ages--a defect that,
because Internet usage by older minors is much greater than
by younger minors, mars the Act in a high proportion of its
potential applications -- renders the Act substantially
overbroad. 

III. THE SWEEPING PROHIBITION OF PROTECTED SPEECH ON THE
     INTERNET CANNOT BE SAVED BY ANALOGY TO CASES IN WHICH
     COURTS HAVE UPHELD LIMITED INDECENCY RESTRICTIONS SHORT
     OF A BAN, OR BY INVOKING THE STANDARDS OF FIRST
     AMENDMENT REVIEW GOVERNING BROADCAST MEDIA.

          As demonstrated in Point I, the Act plainly fails
strict scrutiny.  The government, however, has sought to
defend the Act as nothing more than a simple extension of
narrow indecency restrictions courts have approved to other
media, and perhaps as sustainable under the more relaxed
First Amendment standard applied to the broadcast medium in
FCC v. Pacifica.  See Deft ACLU Br. at 20-22, 26-27, 30-39. 
These arguments fail because the Act's restrictions differ
dispositively from the indecency restrictions at issue in
prior cases, and the Pacifica standard has no application to
content regulation of interactive computer services.


     A.   Judicial Decisions Upholding Narrow Indecency
          Restriction for "Dial-a-Porn," Broadcast Media,
          and Leased Access Cable Television--None of Which
          Involved a Total Ban--Are Entirely Inapposite.

          The decisions cited by the government upholding
indecency restrictions for dial-a-porn, leased access cable
television, and the broadcast media, provide no support for
the Act.  None of those cases approved an effective ban on
indecent speech.  In Pacifica, the Court affirmed an
administrative sanction against the broadcaster of "indecent"
language imposed pursuant to an FCC rule that was not "`an
absolute prohibition'" on use of such language, but "'rather
sought to channel it to times of day when children most
likely would not be exposed to it.'" Pacifica, 438 U.S. at
733 (quoting 59 F.C.C.2d 892 (1976)).  See Sable, 492 U.S. at
127 (observing that Pacifica did not involve a ban); see also
Action for Children's Television v. FCC, 58 F.3d 654, 666
(D.C. Cir. 1995) (en banc) (by allowing indecent material to
be broadcast during nighttime hours, Congress had adequately
"taken into account the First Amendment rights of the very
large numbers of adults who wish to view or listen to
indecent broadcasts").   Similarly, the post-Sable dial-a-
porn restrictions upheld in Dial Information Services Corp.
v. Thornburgh, 938 F.2d 1535 (2d Cir. 1991), cert. denied,
502 U.S. 1072 (1992), and Information Providers Coalition v.
FCC, 928 F.2d 866 (9th Cir. 1991), do not ban indecent speech
to adults; they simply require providers to restrict their
services to adults who request access.  See also Alliance for
Community Media v. FCC, 56 F.3d 105 (D.C. Cir. 1995)
(upholding similar requirement for cable leased access
programming), cert. granted, 116 S.Ct. 471 (1995).  
          Thus, none of the cases on which the government
relies implicated the core First Amendment principle the Act
contravenes:  the government may not ban speech that is
protected for adults in the name of keeping it away from
children.  Instead, these decisions hold that government may
impose carefully crafted measures to protect children from
exposure to indecent speech, provided those measures do not
ban or unduly burden adult access to that speech./*82  
          Although the Act contains a gesture towards the
First Amendment by including the subsection (e)(5) defenses,
those defenses are impossible to implement in many important
areas of online communications.  Even where some of the
defenses might be implemented, they will substantially burden
and dramatically restrict the availability to adults of
constitutionally protected material.  In the case of
broadcast, dial-a-porn, and cable television, the relatively
small number of service providers all indisputably had the
capacity to comply with the indecency restrictions at issue
without also blocking adults from receiving desired
communications.  See, e.g., Fabulous Assoc., 896 F.2d at 787-
88.  As shown above, that approach does not work in
cyberspace.  The fact that, as the government observes, the
Act's defenses would in theory operate something like the
dial-a-porn blocking mechanisms does not change the fact
that, given the realities of the Internet, the Act is "[i]n
effect" a ban.  See Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n,
484 U.S. 383, 389 (1988)(citing Bolger and Butler).  For this
reason, the Act's broad prohibitions are unconstitutional for
the same reason the commercial dial-a-porn ban at issue in
Sable was unconstitutional.

          B.   The Unique First Amendment Standards Governing
               the Broadcast Media Do Not Apply to
               Cyberspace.


          Without seriously disputing that the Act's content-
based prohibitions require strict First Amendment scrutiny,
the government nonetheless suggests that the Internet should
be governed by an unspecified but comparatively relaxed
standard of First Amendment review similar to the standard
Pacifica adopted for FCC regulation of broadcast indecency. 
Deft ACLU Br. at 22-23, 26.  In Pacifica, the Court upheld
the FCC's administrative reprimand of a radio station that
aired a satiric monologue entitled "Filthy Words" at two
o'clock in the afternoon. The Court based its holding on the
"uniquely pervasive" quality of broadcast which, like an
"intruder," "confronts the citizen," who cannot protect
himself from "unexpected program content" because he is
"constantly tuning in and out," and because of the "uniquely
accessible" nature of broadcasting to children.  Pacifica,
438 U.S. at 748-50.  In contrast to a "written message" such
as the "Fuck the Draft" jacket in Cohen v. California, 403
U.S. 15 (1971), the monologue as broadcast "could have
enlarged a child's vocabulary in an instant."  Pacifica, 438
U.S. at 749.  This ease of access even to very young children
justified a degree of restriction on indecent broadcast
expression not permitted on "[o]ther forms of offensive
expression" such as books and motions pictures, which "may be
withheld from the young without restricting the expression at
its source."  Id.  The Pacifica Court "emphasize[d] the
narrowness of [its] holding," noting, among other
qualifications, that the Constitution might preclude a
"criminal prosecution" even for broadcasting the "Filthy
Words" monologue, and that different considerations might
apply in the case of a "two-way radio conversation between a
cab driver and a dispatcher, or a telecast of an Elizabethan
comedy."  Id. at 750./*83 
          In the 18 years since Pacifica was decided, the
Supreme Court has declined repeated invitations to extend the
relaxed broadcast standard to any other media.   In Bolger,
the Court invalidated a ban on mailing unsolicited
contraceptive advertisements, distinguishing Pacifica on the
ground that "[t]he receipt of mail is far less intrusive and
uncontrollable" than broadcast.  Id. at 74.  Bolger
emphasized that "[t]he First Amendment `does not permit the
government to prohibit speech as intrusive unless the
"captive" audience cannot avoid objectionable speech.'"  Id.
at 72 (quoting Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Service
Comm'n, 447 U.S. 530, 542 (1980)).  See also Erznoznik, 422
U.S. at 209; Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77, 86-87 (1949). 
          In Sable, the Court held that the Pacifica
rationale should not be extended to commercial telephone
communications, noting that Pacifica "relied on the `unique'
attributes of broadcasting."  Sable, 492 U.S. at 127 (quoting
Pacifica).  The Court observed that in contrast to "means of
expression which the recipient has no meaningful opportunity
to avoid, the [telephone] medium requires the listener to
take affirmative steps to receive the communication."  Id. at
127-28.  Unlike broadcasting, "dial-a-porn" communications
did not present a captive audience problem:  "the message
received by one who places a call to a dial-a-porn service is
not so invasive or surprising that it prevents an unwilling
listener from avoiding exposure to it."  Id. at 128; see also
Fabulous Assoc., 896 F.2d at 784.  Even more recently, the
Court firmly and unanimously declined to extend the
comparatively lenient First Amendment standards governing
broadcasting to cable television.  See Turner, 114 S. Ct. at
2456-57.
          As with other media that have been asserted to
resemble broadcast in relevant respects, see, e.g., Turner,
114 S.Ct. at 2457, it is possible to argue that some aspects
of online communication resemble some aspects of
broadcasting.  See Deft ACLU Br. at 26.  But a comprehensive
appraisal of the technical capabilities and communicative
possibilities of cyberspace demonstrates that in relevant
respects cyberspace is not like radio or broadcast
television.  The marked differences between the Internet and
the broadcast media, coupled with the Supreme Court's
steadfast unwillingness to extend the "sliding scale"
approach to reviewing content regulation of any other non-
broadcast media, leave no doubt that pleas to extend Pacifica
to cyberspace should be rejected.  
          First, the Internet is emphatically not a medium on
which individuals lack the power to choose the communications
they wish to receive or to protect themselves or their
children from unwanted or unexpected speech.  Compare
Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-51.  To the contrary, recipients of
online communications enjoy a degree of individual control
over incoming material that is attainable in few, if any,
other media.  With the exception of point-to-point e-mail, no
information travels online to a particular individual unless
the individual requests it./*84  Listservs, newsgroups,
chat lines, telnet, ftp, gopher and the World Wide Web all
require an affirmative request by the online user prior to
the user receiving information on his or her computer
screen./*85  Furthermore, when a user makes such an
affirmative request it is usually clear what type of content
will be delivered.  The online medium offers users the
ability to exercise control over precisely what information
they access.  Thus, unlike radio or television, and even more
so than with telephone, there is no significant risk that a
user will be assaulted with totally unsolicited and undesired
content.  The expression does not intrude upon the recipient;
rather, to an even greater extent than telephone, in
cyberspace a recipient must "take affirmative steps to
receive the communication."  Sable, 492 U.S. at 127-28.
          Second, online communications require a level of
sophistication that militates against fashioning a special,
lenient standard of review.  Unlike radio and television,
online communications are not easily accessible to very young
children.  At a minimum, recipients need to be able to read
in order to execute the commands necessary to access
communications.  Cf. Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 749-50.  Moreover,
parents can control their children's access to online
expression through a variety of means, including the many
user-end screening options discussed above.  Given the far
greater degree of user control relative to broadcast, and
given the relative lack of accessibility to young children,
here, as in Bolger, there is no justification for regulating
online expression "at its source."  See Pacifica, 438 U.S. at
749.
          Third, unlike broadcasting, cyberspace presents no
problem of scarcity./*86  To the contrary, one of its
most valuable features is open accessibility to millions of
new users at low cost.  Cyberspace is not a physical or
tangible entity.  It is a giant network which interconnects
innumerable groups of linked computer networks and personal
computers used by individuals.  Accordingly, there is no need
for government regulation to allow speakers to be heard or to
ensure diversity.  Compare, e.g., Turner, 114 S.Ct. at 2456-
57.  Indeed, these important policy goals are imperilled, not
furthered, by content regulation such as that imposed by the
Act./*87
          In short, cyberspace does not share the "unique"
characteristics of broadcast media that have been thought to
justify greater-than-usual tolerance for content regulation.

     C.   The Internet's Unmatched Capacity for Furthering
          the Core Policies of the First Amendment Requires
          That This Court Apply the Rigorous Standards of
          Scrutiny Normally Applicable to Content-Based
          Restrictions.

          The Supreme Court has frequently observed that,
although "the basic principles of freedom of speech and the
press . . . do not vary," each medium of communication
presents "its own peculiar problems" for purposes of First
Amendment analysis.  Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U.S.
495, 503 (1952) (motion pictures).  See also, e.g., Turner,
114 S.Ct. at 2456-57, 2466 (cable TV); Southeastern
Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 557 (1975) (live
entertainment).  This observation was critical to the Court's
approval of relatively lenient First Amendment standards for
broadcasting in Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. at
386-87.  But the Court's attention to the unique
characteristics of certain media has often led it to reaffirm
the importance of adhering to the usual rule of rigorous
review of speech restrictions. E.g., City of Ladue v. Gilleo,
114 S. Ct. 2038, 2046 (1994) (observing, in the course of
striking down an assumedly content-neutral prohibition, that
"[r]esidential signs are an unusually cheap and convenient
form of communication," "[e]specially for persons of modest
means or limited mobility"); Martin v. Struthers, 319 U.S.
141, 146 (1943) ("[d]oor to door distribution of circulars is
essential to the poorly financed causes of little people").
          Acknowledgement of the already enormous and rapidly
growing social importance of interactive computer services
requires a similar response here.  Indeed, cyberspace's
unique and revolutionary capability to facilitate ordinary
citizens' ability to communicate and learn is a major reason
why online communications should receive the highest level of
First Amendment protection./*88 
          The Free Speech and Press Clauses are based on the
simple but important belief "that the ultimate good desired
is better reached by free trade in ideas."  Abrams v. United
States, 250 U.S. at 630 (Holmes, J., dissenting, joined by
Brandeis, J.).  See Turner, 114 S.Ct. at 2458.  Cyberspace
has the capacity to further this fundamental constitutional
commitment more effectively than any previous medium of
communication.  By means unforeseeable to the First
Amendment's authors, cyberspace offers individual citizens
unprecedented opportunities to enjoy in a direct, personal
way the freedoms of "speech," "press," "assembl[y]," and
"petition."  The Internet makes speaking and listening to a
wide variety of others cheaper and easier than ever before. 
Through cyberspace, an individual citizen from her keyboard
can reach more people than can any conventional newspaper. 
Thousands of new personal, professional, political and
avocational associations are forged on the Internet every
day, many of which link people who would never have had
opportunities to communicate before./*89  Many
politicians in the United States have already established
online links with their constituents, and the process is sure
to continue./*90  Cyberspace has already eliminated
wealth or political power as the prerequisites to mass
communications, and the implications of this historic
development will be felt for decades.  See generally Owen
Fiss, "Symposium:  In Search of a New Paradigm," 104 Yale
L.J. 1613 (1995).  Cyberspace is truly a global electronic
marketplace of ideas. 
          Because access is so inexpensive and easy,
virtually everyone in the United States has or soon will have
access to the Internet and other interactive computer
services, making this, by far, the most democratic means of
communication ever devised./*91  All that is needed to
"enter" cyberspace is a computer, a "modem" or other
connection, and simple software.  For a relatively modest
investment--far less than the cost of purchasing a printing
press, newspaper, broadcast station, or cable system --
individuals can make their message available to more people
than they could reach if they owned the printing press,
newspaper, broadcast station, or cable system.  They can
electronically communicate their messages to thousands in a
fraction of the time and for a fraction of the cost required
to leaflet a single city block.  It is not even necessary to
own a computer to have regular and meaningful access to the
Internet./*92  Persons of very modest means now have the
ability both to send and to receive information on a scale
that until now would have been unattainable even for the
wealthy.
          The Internet has given citizens of modest means
power even William Randolph Hearst would have envied.  The
new interactive computer medium has the power to democratize
and diversify the marketplace of ideas.  As Congress found,
"[t]he Internet and other interactive computer services offer
a forum for a true diversity of political discourse, unique
opportunities for cultural development, and myriad avenues
for intellectual activity."  Act,   509.  More so than any
other medium, the interactive computer medium "today stands
at the center of an ongoing telecommunications revolution
with still undefined potential to affect the way we
communicate and develop our intellectual resources."  Turner,
114 S.Ct. at 2451.  It serves the interests protected and
fostered by the First Amendment like no other medium.  First
Amendment analysis must respect its awesome potential.  
          In sum, this Court should accord to the interactive
computer medium the most vigilant protection from government
censorship and overreaching.  The unparalleled potential of
cyberspace to effectuate the core policies of the First
Amendment calls for a reaffirmance of our "profound national
commitment" to public discourse that is "uninhibited, robust,
and wide-open."  New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. at 270. 
          The challenged provisions of the Act, however,
represent an indiscriminate and damaging retreat from that
commitment, one that reflects an as-yet poor legislative
understanding even of the basic operating methods of
cyberspace.  Those provisions are facially invalid because
they abridge far too much protected speech while affording
little incremental protection for minors, and threaten to
disrupt the rapidly unfolding development of a salutary
communications revolution that until now has flourished with
a minimum of governmental interference.  

IV.  PLAINTIFFS ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THEIR CLAIM THAT THE
     ACT IS UNCONSTITUTIONALLY VAGUE.

          Even if the Act could otherwise survive
constitutional scrutiny under the First Amendment -- and it
cannot -- this Court should nevertheless enjoin its
enforcement because it is unconstitutionally vague under the
Fifth Amendment.  "No one may be required at peril of life,
liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal
statutes.  All are entitled to be informed as to what the
State commands or forbids."  Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378
U.S. 347, 351 (1964) (quotations omitted).  The Due Process
Clause of the Fifth Amendment "requires that a penal statute
define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that
ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and
in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and
discriminatory enforcement."  Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S.
352, 357 (1983) (holding criminal statute facially invalid as
unconstitutionally vague)./*93   And where -- as here --
the enactment threatens expression protected by the First
Amendment, the enactment must provide more notice and allow
less discretion than for other activities.  "Where a
statute's literal scope . . . is capable of reaching
expression sheltered by the First Amendment, the doctrine
demands a greater degree of specificity than in other
contexts."  Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, 573 (1974).  The
particular evil of vague criminal prohibitions applied to
expressive activity is that the uncertainty causes
individuals to "steer far wider of the unlawful zone,"
Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 526 (1958), than if the
boundaries were "clearly marked."  Baggett v. Bullit, 377
U.S. 360, 371 (1964).  "Free speech may not be so inhibited." 
Id. (citing cases)./*94
          The Act is unconstitutionally vague in at least two
fundamental respects.  First, no ordinary person could
determine with reasonable certainty which communications
Congress sought to proscribe in the Act.  The terms
"indecent" and "patently offensive as measured by
contemporary community standards" are hopelessly
vague./*95  Second, the defenses established by the Act,
especially as applied to content providers who do not charge
for access to their speech and those who host Web pages and
other online sites, are also fatally vague.  Plaintiffs,
their members, and their subscribers, patrons, and customers
are forced to guess at whether their online expressive
activities may give rise to criminal prosecution.  These law-
abiding citizens take the duty to obey the law, and the
prospect of criminal penalties, seriously.  They will self-
censor a great deal of protected speech in order to avoid
potential criminal prosecution.  The Act thus impermissibly
chills constitutionally protected expression.

     A.   The Terms "Indecent" and "Patently Offensive As
          Measured By Contemporary Community Standards" Are
          Unconstitutionally Vague.

          Both "indecent" and "patently offensive" are
entirely subjective terms; there is therefore no objective
yardstick for measuring the boundaries of the Act's
proscriptions./*96  As the Supreme Court observed in
striking down a California statute that outlawed "offensive
conduct" as applied to an individual who wore a jacket
displaying the words "Fuck the Draft":

          How is one to distinguish this from any other
          offensive word?  Surely the State has no right to
          cleanse public debate to the point where it is
          grammatically palatable to the most squeamish among
          us.  Yet no readily ascertainable general principle
          exists for stopping short of that result were we to
          affirm the judgment below.  For, while the
          particular four-letter word being litigated here is
          perhaps more distasteful than most others of its
          genre, it is nevertheless often true that one man's
          vulgarity is another's lyric.  Indeed, we think it
          is largely because governmental officials cannot
          make principled distinctions in this area that the
          Constitution leaves matters of taste and style so
          largely to the individual.

Cohen, 403 U.S. at 25 (emphasis added).  The government
maintains that the Act's only design is to control children's
access to "what is colloquially referred to as pornography." 
Deft ACLU Br. at 21.  That design certainly cannot be gleaned
from the text of the Act, or from its legislative history. 
Congress expressly stated that it intended to adopt the FCC
"patently offensive" standard applied in Pacifica to censure
George Carlin's "Seven Dirty Words" monologue.  Conf. Rep. at
188-89.  Although that monologue could be described as
"'vulgar,' 'offensive,' and 'shocking,'" Pacifica, 438 U.S.
at 747, it could not be described as "pornography."  The
obvious disconnect between the government's attempt to
describe the Act as applying only to "pornography," on the
one hand, and the much broader text of the Act and Congress's
much broader explanation of its understanding, highlights the
fatal vagueness of the key statutory terms.
          Even if a person of "common intelligence" could
reasonably discern what Congress meant by "indecent" and
"patently offensive" in the abstract, that understanding is
of little use because "indecency is largely a function of
context," Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 742, and the "patently
offensive" standard of   233(d)(1)(B), by its terms, demands
that offensiveness be judged "in context."/*97  The
context is, in turn, a function of the medium.  See Pacifica,
438 U.S. at 748; Sable, 492 U.S. at 127-28.  Congress clearly
understood and intended to adopt this principle in
establishing those standards, noting that the meaning of
indecency may vary "depending on the communications medium to
which it has been applied."  Conf. Report at 188.
          But the Act provides no guidance as to whether a
particular communication is "indecent" or "patently
offensive" in the "context" of the online computer medium. 
The Internet bears no resemblance to broadcast television or
telephone communications -- the only other contexts in which
the FCC has applied the terms./*98  The online medium is
not thrust upon unwilling listeners, as with broadcast. 
Moreover, the immensely broad and diverse range of
communications available over the online medium is totally
different from other mediums.  In addition, there is no
bottleneck control over content and no significant barrier to
entry into the marketplace of ideas, and unlike broadcast,
cable and telephone, the online computer medium has been
virtually unregulated.  As a result, what might be viewed as
"intolerable" in other mediums could well be viewed as
tolerable in the cyberspace medium.  Cf. Pacifica, 438 U.S.
at 747 (noting that "[w]ords that are commonplace in one
setting are shocking in another").  However, the cyberspace
medium is so new, the average person cannot know the
boundaries of what will or will not be deemed "indecent" or
"patently offensive" in this new medium.
          Making the "patent offensiveness" of the
communication depend upon "contemporary community standards"
exacerbates the vagueness of this critical statutory term. 
Both of the FCC tests from which the Act's language was
borrowed expressly tied the community standard to the medium
at issue.  Although the legislative history states that
Congress intended for the Act to incorporate those tests, the
text of the Act (unlike the text of the FCC tests for those
other mediums) does not expressly tie the community standard
to the cyberspace medium, leaving the ordinary person to
guess as to what standards of "offensiveness" will be applied
-- what is tolerated and deemed appropriate in the
"cyberspace community" or in the community at large?/*99
          Even if an ordinary person could determine whether
the "cyberspace community" or the larger community's
standards would govern, the statutory text fails to specify
which geographic aspect of that community is relevant.  In
the "obscenity" context, it is settled that the relevant
community is the local community in which the jury sits. 
See, e.g., Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87 (1974)
(obscenity); United States v. Thomas, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS
1069 (6th Cir. Jan. 29, 1996) (obscenity in computer
context).  See also, e.g., American Booksellers v. Webb, 919
F.2d 1493 (11th Cir. 1990) (state "harmful to minors"
statute).  The Act uses the terms "obscene" and "indecent" in
the same prohibitory clause, which would lead an ordinary
person to understand that the same community standard applied
to both terms. See   223(a)(1)(B).  But the Conference Report
expressly states that the Act is "intended to establish a
uniform national standard of content regulation."  Conf.
Report at 191 (emphasis added).  This apparent inconsistency
between text and current caselaw, on the one hand, and
legislative history on the other, alone creates a fatal
ambiguity in the Act: how can a reasonable person be expected
to determine which community standard, local or national,
will apply when judging the appropriateness of the
communications he or she is disseminating?
          Furthermore, even if it could be determined whether
Congress intended a "local" or "national" standard, either
approach would involve ambiguities, when applied to this new
medium, that would make it impossible for "ordinary people
[to] understand what conduct is prohibited."  Kolender, 461
U.S. at 357.  If a local community standard applies, it is
impossible for the vast majority of online speakers to
determine what standard will govern the lawfulness of their
speech because they do not know, and cannot control, who
receives the speech or the geographical location it reaches. 
Communications posted anywhere on the Internet are available
throughout the United States.  A speaker cannot possibly have
knowledge (or reason to know) the local standards of
offensiveness in each of the local communities in which his
or her speech will be available.  Unlike in Sable, where the
Court found that dial-a-porn services could limit their
messages to the communities they chose to serve, 492 U.S. at
125, local community standards imposed on computer online
communications would "place message senders in a 'double
bind' by compelling them to tailor all their messages to the
least tolerant community."  Id. at 124./*100  Cf.
Thomas, supra, at *23-*26 (leaving open question whether
First Amendment requires new definition of "community" in
context of obscenity prosecution involving computer
transmissions). 
          If, on the other hand, Congress intended to apply a
"national" community standard -- a standard nowhere indicated
in the text of the Act -- it would be impossible for any
speaker to determine with reasonable certainty what that
standard is.  The FCC, in interpreting and applying indecency
in the broadcast medium according to a "nonlocal" standard,
has stated that its definition of indecency "does not address
a particular geographic area, but relies instead on the
expertise of Commissioners drawing on their knowledge of the
views of the average viewer or listener as well as their
general expertise in broadcast matters."  In re Sagittarius
Broadcasting Corp., 7 F.C.C.R. at 6876.  There is no
"expertise" that can be brought to bear here; the FCC has no
enforcement authority, so even if it could develop a common
and consistent view of "offensiveness" in the national
cyberspace community, it would not, even over time, provide
meaningful guidelines for speakers.  The Act will be enforced
on an ad hoc basis by prosecutors and juries throughout the
country.  It is difficult to comprehend how a local jury
could meaningfully apply a "national community" standard of
"offensiveness," or how speakers could know what local juries
might deem "patently offensive" nationally. 
          Congress created more confusion with regard to
another fundamental issue -- scienter.  The Conference Report
suggests that Congress understood the "patently offensiveness
inquiry" to require "the intention to be patently offensive." 
Conf. Report at 189 (emphasis added).  But it is entirely
unclear what that "intention" would entail, since much of the
material Congress sought to suppress is certainly not
intended to offend the viewer, but rather to titillate.  No
such scienter requirement is found in the text of the Act or
in the FCC standard Congress adopted.  Again, a speaker is
left to guess whether an "intent" requirement is or is not
sub silentio imbedded in the statutory terms, and what
exactly that requirement might be.  This also creates a
serious problem for plaintiffs and other speakers./*101
          The inevitable result of these ambiguities,
particularly given the severe criminal penalties for a wrong
guess, is that speakers will "steer far wider of the unlawful
zone," Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. at 526, and much
constitutionally protected expression will be suppressed.
          The uncertainty of the coverage of the Act, and its
attendant chilling effect, is forcefully evidenced in the
accompanying declarations.  The declarants -- libraries,
booksellers, publishers, universities, writers, editors and
other content providers -- post material of serious artistic,
literary, scientific, educational and informational value. 
The declarants provide information about medical, literary,
artistic, cultural, political and scientific issues.  Given
the ambiguity in the Act, the University of Pennsylvania
Libraries risks criminal prosecution for posting academic
material directly related, and essential, to courses in
abnormal psychology, sexuality, history and literature./*102 
The Fort Vancouver Regional Library in Washington State fears
prosecution for providing patrons access to full text
articles in such mainstream publications as
Cosmopolitan./*103  Booksellers throughout the country who
offer links to the World Wide Web site of Random House and an
excerpt from the national best-seller, Primary Colors, face
criminal prosecution./*104  Members of the Health
Sciences Libraries Consortium fear criminal prosecution for
providing detailed, comprehensive information about the AIDS
virus./*105  Public interest groups such as Media Access
Project and Center for Democracy and Technology cannot post
information educating the public about their mission without
risk of prosecution./*106  If the Act is not enjoined,
these materials may have to be removed from the Internet. 
          Contrary to the government's suggestion, and
Congress' apparent belief, see Conf. Report at 189, the
Supreme Court has never upheld the term "indecency" or the
phrase "patently offensive as measured by contemporary
community standards" against a vagueness attack.  That
question was not addressed in either Pacifica or Sable, the
two cases relied upon by the government.  In Sable, the Court
struck down Congress's ban on indecent dial-a-porn telephone
communications on First Amendment grounds, without intimating
any view on the constitutionality of the standard applied by
the FCC under the Fifth Amendment.  492 U.S. at 131.  Whether
that standard was vague was irrelevant to its determination.
          Nor did the Court uphold the "indecency" standard
against a vagueness challenge in Pacifica.  The Court
stressed that it was examining only "whether the [FCC] has
the authority to proscribe this particular broadcast."  438
U.S. at 742 (emphasis added).  The Court ruled only as to the
legitimacy of the FCC's determination of the "indecency" of
that single broadcast, not the legitimacy of the standard in
general.  Thus, the Court declined to address the plaintiff's
First Amendment overbreadth argument.  Id. at 743.  
          Even if the Court's ruling in Pacifica were misread
as having ruled that the FCC broadcast indecency standard is
not vague, the decision would not govern here.  As the Court
repeatedly stressed, the indecency standard before the Court
applied solely to the broadcast medium, a medium with
"unique" characteristics.  Id. at 749, 750.  The Court's view
of the agency's construction of that term thus has no
relevance to an uninterpreted, unguided use of the term as
applied to an entirely different medium.  More importantly,
the Pacifica Court expressly disavowed any suggestion that
its ruling would apply in the context of a criminal sanction. 
438 U.S. at 750.  To the contrary, the Court has consistently
held that, "where a statute imposes criminal penalties, the
standard of certainty is higher."  Kolender, 461 U.S. at 358
n.8.  Accord, e.g., Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 515
(1948) ("The standards of certainty in statutes punishing for
offenses is higher than in those depending primarily upon
civil sanction for enforcement.").  Thus, even if Pacifica
could be understood to rule that the indecency standard is
not vague in the civil context -- which it cannot -- that
holding would not apply in this criminal context.
          The government's defense of "indecent" and
"patently offensive by contemporary community standards"
essentially boils down to an admonition that plaintiffs
should trust government prosecutors.  It is precisely for
this reason that the Act is unconstitutionally vague: the
Fifth Amendment protects speakers from being subjected to the
unguided discretion of criminal prosecutors.  The Act does
not provide explicit standards for enforcement authorities,
and the ambiguity of the critical terms "encourages arbitrary
and erratic arrests and convictions."  Papachristou v.
Jacksonville, 405 U.S. at 162.  Local prosecutors are free to
define the category of prohibited speech as they see fit,
which would permit selective application against disfavored
speakers. In the case of Internet communications, every local
prosecutor has jurisdiction to prosecute any speaker, no
matter where that speaker is located, because of the ubiquity
of the communications links.  Cf. Thomas, supra, at *16-*19. 
Consequently, the most aggressive prosecutor in the least
tolerant community could prosecute virtually anything on the
Internet.  The Act thus "'furnishes a convenient tool for
harsh and discriminatory enforcement by local prosecuting
officials, against particular groups deemed to merit their
displeasure.'"  Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. at 360 (quoting
Papachristou, 405 U.S. at 170 (internal quotes omitted)). 
For these reasons, plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the
merits of their claim that the challenged provisions of the
Act are unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fifth
Amendment.

     B.   The Act's Defenses Are Unconstitutionally Vague.

          As noted above, for content-providers who do not
charge for their speech -- the individual or library, for
example -- the verified credit card/ID defenses (47 U.S.C.
  223(e)(5)(B)) are irrelevant because, as a practical
matter, they cannot be utilized.  For these speakers, the
only possible defense is the vaguely worded "good faith"
defense.  Congress has provided no guidance whatsoever
regarding what might or might not constitute "good faith,
reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions under the
circumstances to restrict or prevent access by minors."  Id.
  223(e)(5)(A)./*107  To the contrary, while permitting
the FCC to opine as to what measures "might" satisfy that
defense, Congress expressly and emphatically stated that the
FCC's views would constitute nothing more than "evidence of
good faith efforts."  Id.; Conf. Rep. at 190-91.  If Congress
did not anticipate that the FCC could definitively articulate
measures that would satisfy the defense, persons "of common
intelligence must necessarily guess at [the defense's]
meaning and differ as to its application."  Roberts v. United
States Jaycees, 468 U.S. at 629 (internal quotation omitted). 
The inevitable result is that speakers who do not charge a
fee for access to their speech cannot have reasonable
assurance that the steps they take will constitute a
defense./*108  As a result of the patent ambiguities in
the Act, and the draconian penalties for a wrong guess, these
speakers will "steer far wider of the unlawful zone," Speiser
v. Randall, 357 U.S. at 526, than if the boundaries were
"clearly marked."  Baggett v. Bullit, 377 U.S. at 371./*109  
          Even as to those defenses theoretically available
to fee-charging content-providers, there are significant
ambiguities.  For example, the Act establishes an absolute
defense to posting indecent material "in a manner available
to a person under 18 years of age," 47 U.S.C.   223(d)(1)(B),
if the defendant "restricted access . . . by requiring use of
a verified credit card."  Id.   223(e)(5)(B).  But nowhere is
the nature of the required "verification"
described./*110  Plaintiffs believe the provision must
be construed to require no more than the type of
"verification" performed by any retail store.  But plaintiffs
and their members have a legitimate concern that individual
prosecutors (or juries) may construe the defense to require a
"verification" somehow tied to the cardholder's age (or, even
worse, to the card user's age)./*111  Such a requirement
would place an impossible burden on content providers, since
there is no face-to-face contact between the provider and the
recipient of the message and, typically, no papers or ID
documents are exchanged.
          Another implacable ambiguity in the Act arises for
those services that host Web pages or other online sites for
content-providers, without exercising any control over
content, but nonetheless providing the computer facility at
which the content physically resides and from which a
recipient obtains access to the content.  Online service
providers, such as plaintiffs AOL and Prodigy, and Internet
service providers, such as plaintiffs Netcom and OpNet, offer
extensive services of this kind.  It is entirely unclear
whether such services might themselves be deemed to "display"
-- in the sense of "post" -- content from the hosted Web
sites under   223(d)(1)(B) because the communications reside
on their computers./*112  And, if they are so deemed, it
is equally unclear whether such services can invoke the
"access provider" defenses.  The ambiguity arises, in part,
because while the services may not be considered to "solely .
. . . provid[e] access or connection to or from a facility .
. . not under [their] control," their role clearly "does not
include the creation of the content of the communication." 
  223(e)(1).  The Conference Report indicates that the access
provider defenses must be "construed broadly to avoid . . . a
regime of vicarious liability" and are "designed to target
the criminal penalties of new sections 223(a) and (d) at
content providers, rather than entities that simply offer
general access to the Internet and other online content." 
Conf. Rep. at 190.  But unless and until the access provider
defenses are broadly and definitively construed, the
uncertainty regarding the scope of those defenses is another
reason for preliminarily enjoining enforcement of the
Act./*113

V.   THE IRREPARABLE HARM TO PLAINTIFFS, THEIR MEMBERS, AND
     THEIR SUBSCRIBERS, PATRONS, AND CUSTOMERS FAR OUTWEIGHS
     ANY HARM TO THE GOVERNMENT IF AN INJUNCTION ISSUES, AND
     THE PUBLIC INTEREST FAVORS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.  

          Deprivation of First Amendment freedoms, even for
minimal periods of time, necessarily and always constitutes
irreparable injury.  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373
(1976); Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 72 (3d Cir.), cert.
denied, 493 U.S. 848 (1989) (quoting Elrod and noting that
this principle is "well-established")./*114  "'[A]
chilling effect on free expression'" is a such a deprivation,
and is all that plaintiffs must show to establish irreparable
harm.  Hohe, 868 F.2d at 73 (quoting Dombrowski v. Pfister,
380 U.S. 479, 487 (1965)).  Plaintiffs, their members, and
their subscribers, patrons, and customers regularly engage in
constitutionally protected expressive activities that they
reasonably fear subject them to criminal liability under the
Act.  See, e.g., Croneberger Dec., Tab 13, Ex. B (research
study on Pornography located on web site of Carnegie Library
of Pittsburgh); Hammer Dec., Tab 20, Ex. A, B (Cosmopolitan
article summarizing research on sexual orgasms located on web
site of Fort Vancouver Regional Library); Krug Dec., Tab 23,
Ex. C, D, E (examples of art, medical and cultural
information located on Internet sites of libraries); Mitchell
Dec., Tab 25, Ex. C, D (examples of articles located on
Internet site of HotWired magazine); Mosher Dec., Tab 26, Ex.
A, B, C, D (examples of academic materials on sexuality,
psychological disorders, and history located on Internet site
of University of Pennsylvania libraries); Scorza Dec., Tab
28, Ex. A, B (examples of medical information located on
Internet site of Health Sciences Library Consortium); Teicher
Dec., Tab 33, Ex. B, C (examples of book excerpts located on
Internet sites of bookstores and publishers); Wolf Dec., Tab
39, Ex. B, C (examples of magazine articles on Internet site
of HotWired).  This reasonable fear of criminal liability,
and the consequent threat of criminal prosecution, is
currently chilling the exercise of their First Amendment
rights.  See, e.g., Hammer Dec.   7, Tab 20 (stating that
"[b]ecause of the passage of the Communications Decency Act
of 1996, the library has decided to refrain, at least
temporarily, from making its web site available directly to
the public"); Krug Dec.   15, Tab 23 (stating that "[a]t
least one library that I am aware of has removed forty titles
from its card catalog in direct response to the Act");
Wheaton Dec., Tab 38, Ex. A   11 ("I have now had my web
space taken away by its owner provider due to his fear of
ramifications of the CDA")./*115
          The public has a substantial, constitutionally
protected interest in having access to a robust, uninhibited
flow of constitutionally protected speech.  Virginia Bd. of
Pharmacy v. Virginia Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748 (1976). 
This interest is severely damaged by the Act.  Although the
public's interest in protecting children from communications
that would be inappropriate for them is also substantial,
that interest is -- at best -- only marginally advanced by
the provisions plaintiffs ask this Court to enjoin.
          The damage to constitutionally protected expression
that has already occurred, and the further damage that will
occur if defendants are not enjoined, is incalculable. 
Substantial quantities of constitutionally protected speech
are being and will continue to be suppressed across the
Nation.  The concomitant negative impact on the burgeoning
medium for interactive computer services will be substantial. 
          Entry of the relief requested, pending final
resolution of the merits, will cause defendants no
significant harm, especially because there are other criminal
statutes (including this Act's application to "obscene"
communications) that prohibit the communications they claim
are the principal focus of the Act.  Any delay in entry of
relief, however, perpetuates and compounds the damage to
plaintiffs' First Amendment rights and the First Amendment
rights of millions of adults to send and receive
communications that are indisputably constitutionally
protected for them.
                          CONCLUSION
          For the foregoing reasons, preliminary injunctive
relief against enforcement of    223(a)(1)(B)(ii), 223(a)(2)
and 223(d) of the Act is essential and amply justified.

  2.  Title V of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 
Provisions of the Act that are to be codified will usually be
cited only by their future U.S. Code citation.

  3.  A more comprehensive description of the Internet and
other interactive computer services, the way they function,
and how they are utilized, can be found in paragraphs 31
through 62 of the Complaint, and in the Declaration of Vinton
G. Cerf, Tab 11, Ex. A (detailing history and development of
the Internet).  Cerf, who has been called the "father of the
Internet," co-designed the communications protocols on which
the Internet is based.

     Declarations, statements and affidavits are exhibits to
ALA Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, Tabs 1-
39.  The declarations and affidavits have been arranged
alphabetically by the last name of the declarant.  Each
declaration also may include exhibits, labeled Exhibits A, B,
C, etc.  A complete list of the declarations and affidavits
is included in the Motion and in an Appendix to this
Memorandum Of Law.  Thus, a citation to Doe Dec.   3, Tab 4,
Ex. A would be a citation to Exhibit A of the declaration of
John Doe, located at Tab 4 of the exhibits to the Motion for
Preliminary Injunction.


  4.  Technically, the "Internet" is only the largest of this
network of interconnected networks, but popularly the term
"Internet" is now used to refer to all of these networks
collectively.  This brief uses the term "Internet" in the
broader, popular manner to refer to all of the interconnected
networks.  In addition to these networks, there are other
computer services, networks, and networks-of-networks that
are not interconnected to the Internet.  Although the bulk of
analysis in this brief focuses on the Internet, the
Communications Decency Act equally applies to these other
services and networks, and most of the same constitutional
concerns are raised for those services and networks.

Berners-Lee, who co-invented the Web and who heads the World
Wide Web Consortium.  Berners-Lee Dec.    1-18, Tab 7.  Other
methods use "ftp" (or file transfer protocol) or a program
and format named "gopher."

34-36, Tab 10.

  21.  Cady Dec.    6, 7, 12, 14, 15, 31, 35, 39, Tab 10;

  24.  Cady Dec.    36, 38, 39, Tab 10.

  25.  Sending obscenity and child pornography by computer is
prohibited by federal criminal statutes.  See 18 U.S.C.    
2251-52, 2256-57; 28 U.S.C.    1464-65; United States v.
Thomas, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 1069 (6th Cir. Jan. 29, 1996)
(upholding convictions under    1464 and 1465 for
transporting obscene materials by means of computer bulletin
board service).  See also Act, Section 507 (amending
obscenity laws to apply to interactive computer services). 
Plaintiffs do not challenge the constitutionality of 47
U.S.C.     223(a)(1)(B)(ii), 223(a)(2), and 223(d) to the
extent they prohibit the transmission of communications that
are obscene or constitute child pornography.   

  26.  "Telecommunications device" is defined to exclude an
"interactive computer service," 47 U.S.C.   223(h)(1)(B), but
would apparently include a modem used for private e-mail
communications.

  27.  Pursuant to   223(a)(2), it is also a crime knowingly
to provide use of a "telecommunications facility" that is
used to violate   223(a)(1)(B).

  28.  See FCC v. Pacifica Found., 438 U.S. 726, 741 n.16
(1978).  That is a significant problem for some plaintiffs,
including universities with freshmen under the age of
eighteen.  See Mosher Dec.   6, 10, Tab 26; Boiss  Dec.   8,
Tab 6.

  29.  "Interactive computer service" is defined as "any
information service, system, or access software provider that
provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a
computer server, including specifically a service or system
that provides access to the Internet and such systems
operated or services offered by libraries or educational
institutions."  47 U.S.C.   223(h)(2) referring to 47 U.S.C.
  230(e)(2).

  30.  It is a separate criminal offense knowingly to make
available a facility that is used to violate   223(d)(1).
  223(d)(2).

  31.  Cf. Miller, 413 U.S. at 24.  State "harmful to minors"
statutes -- which the Conference Committee specifically
rejected as a model, see Joint Explanatory Statement of the
Committee of Conference for Title V, Communications Decency
Act of 1996 at 189 (hereinafter "Conf. Rep."), attached as
Exhibit 2 to Defendant's Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for
a Temporary Restraining Order in the ACLU case, No. 96-963
("Deft ACLU Br."), do typically exempt materials with serious
value.

  32.  438 U.S. at 745 (plurality op. of Stevens, J.)
(describing the words at issue in the Carlin monologue as
"patently offensive words dealing with sex and excretion").

  33.  Conf. Rep. at 188.

  34.  See also, e.g., 141 Cong. Rec. S8341 (June 14, 1995)
(Sen. Leahy) ("works of fiction, ranging from `Lady
Chatterly's Lover' to Newt Gingrich's science fiction novel
`1945,' which contains some steamy scenes, could not be put
out on the Internet because of the risk that a minor might
download it").  In fact, titles and excerpts of popular
articles or books located on the Internet do contain the
"seven dirty words."  See Croneberger Dec.   5, Tab 13
(titles containing expletives); Hammer Dec.   5, Tab 20
(same); Krug Dec.   8, 13, Tab 23 (same); Teicher Dec., Tab
33, Ex. B (excerpt from number one bestseller Primary Colors,
including expletives); Shelkrot Dec.   4, Tab 29.

  35.  For a description of content on the Internet that
could be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" for
minors, see Complaint,    64-79.

  36.  Communities across the country have banned or sought
to ban classic works of literature, such as Of Mice and Men
by John Steinbeck, As I Lay Dying by William Faulkner, The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Adventures of Tom
Sawyer by Mark Twain, Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger,
I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou, as
"indecent" for minors.  See Krug Dec.   7, Tab 23; see also
Guttenberg Dec.   11 and Ex. Q, Tab 19 (detailing the list of
books published by Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group
that have been banned somewhere in the United States in the
last three years, including Silas Marner by George Eliot, Are
You There, God? It's Me, Margaret by Judy Blume, The Great
Santini by Pat Conroy and The Black Marble by Joseph
Wambaugh).  See Also Action for Children's Television v. FCC,
852 F.2d 1332, 1340 n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (noting that
portions of the works of James Joyce, D.H. Lawrence, James
Baldwin, and Frank Harris could be deemed "indecent").  Even
the American Heritage Dictionary and parts of the Bible have
been attacked as being "indecent" for minors. Krug Dec.   7,
Tab 23; Hammer Dec.   4, Tab 20; Guttenberg Dec., Tab 19, Ex.
Q.

  37.   See Hammer Dec., Tab 20, Ex. A, B (Cosmopolitan
article summarizing research on sexual orgasms located on web
site of Fort Vancouver Regional Library); Krug Dec., Tab 23,
Ex. C, D, E (examples of art, medical and cultural
information located on Internet sites of libraries); Mitchell
Dec., Tab 25, Ex. C, D (examples of articles located on
Internet site of HotWired magazine); Mosher Dec., Tab 26, Ex.
A, B, C, D (examples of academic materials on sexuality,
psychological disorders, and history located on Internet site
of University of Pennsylvania libraries); Scorza Dec., Tab
28, Ex. A, B (examples of medical information located on
Internet site of Health Sciences Library Consortium); Teicher
Dec., Tab 33, Ex. B, C (examples of book excerpts located on
Internet sites of bookstores and publishers); Wolf Dec., Tab
39, Ex. B, C (examples of magazine articles on Internet site
of HotWired).

  38.  See Deft. ACLU Br. at 11 n.7, and Exhibit 9 thereto. 

  39.  Croneberger Dec.    3, 6, and Ex. B, at Tab 13.

  40.  The government also relies on the Final Report of the
Attorney General's Commission On Pornography (1986).  See
Deft ACLU Br. at 28 n.14.  That report itself contains page
after page of descriptions of graphic sexual acts that could
be deemed indecent or patently offensive.  Apparently, it
would be a felony to put that government report online.

  41.  Bradner Dec.    5, 7, 9, Tab 7; Berners-Lee Dec.    8,
13, Tab 4.

  42.  Both sponsors of the Act expressly acknowledged as
much.  See 141 Cong. Rec. S8090 (June 9, 1995), 141 Cong.
Rec. S8330, S8333 (June 14, 1995); id. at S9771 (July 12,
1995) (Senator Exon); 141 Cong. Rec. S8333 (June 14, 1995)
(Senator Coats).  The Department of Justice shared that view,
and expressed serious reservations about the
constitutionality of the bill precisely because it threatened
to deprive adults of access to speech that is
constitutionally protected for them.  See Leahy Dec.    11,
17, Tab 24.  

  43.  If "verified" means only verification that a card
bearing the number given was issued and is still valid, most
speakers who charge for their speech could probably rely on
the "verified credit card" defense.  However, if "verified"
means verification that the card was issued to a person who
was 18 or older when the card was issued, or who would be 18
at the time the card was used, or verification that the
person using the card, as opposed to the cardholder, was 18
or older, it would in many cases be impossible, and in all
cases extremely burdensome and expensive, to obtain the
requisite verification.  Berners-Lee Dec.    15, 16, Tab 4. 
The ambiguity concerning the meaning of "verified" is another
reason why the Act is unconstitutionally vague.  See Point
IV, infra.

  44.  See Bradner Dec.    5, 7, 9, 10, Tab 7; Cady Dec.   
3, 14, 20, 29, Tab 10; Collet Dec.   10, Tab 12; Croneberger
Dec.   8, Tab 13; Geiman Dec.   6, Tab 17; Grenquist Dec.
  11, Tab 18; Hammer Dec.   8, Tab 20; Krug Dec.   14, Tab
23; Mitchell Dec.   8, Tab 25; Teicher Dec.   10, Tab 33;
Wolf Dec.   7, Tab 39.

  45.  Bradner Dec.    5, 7, 9, Tab 7; Collet Dec.   10, Tab
12; Cady Dec.    3, 7-8, 14, 20, 23, 27, 29, 39, Tab 10.  The
communications protocols underlying the Web lack any
provision to track and screen individuals who access the Web. 
Berners-Lee Dec.   16, Tab 4.  Using additional programming,
it would be possible for an individual web publisher to
screen access using a credit card or other identification
requirement, but such a screening process would be
prohibitively expensive and time consuming for non-fee
charging speakers.  Id.; Cady Dec.   36, Tab 10.  The same
constraints apply to ftp and gopher sites.  Cady Dec.   39,
Tab 10.

  46.  Bradner Dec.    3-5, Tab 7; Collet Dec.   10, Tab 12;
Cady Dec.   20, Tab 10.

  47.  See Bradner Dec.   10, Tab 7; Croneberger Dec.   8,
Tab 13; Geiman Dec.   6, Tab 17; Grenquist Dec.   11, Tab 18;
Hammer Dec.   8, Tab 20; Krug Dec.   14, Tab 20; Mitchell
Dec.   8, Tab 25; Teicher Dec.   10, Tab 33; Wolf Dec.   7,
Tab 39.

  48.  Moreover, even if pre-registration by content users
were practically or economically feasible (which it is not),
users' ability to find and utilize material would be
drastically diminished because few of them could anticipate
the need to pre-register for a particular site.  A huge
percentage of Internet traffic consists of users engaged in
spontaneous unpredictable research (often aided by the
extraordinary search potential of the hypertext language that
drives the World Wide Web).  A pre-registration requirement
would effectively make this type of search impossible as to
files or Web Sites containing any material deemed "patently
offensive."  The attendant decline in adult users' visits to
information sites that had pre-registration requirements
could be expected, in turn, to diminish content providers'
willingness to place arguably offensive material online.

  49.  There are legitimate reasons why speakers may want to
voluntarily restrict access to their communications -- to
protect intellectual property or privacy interests, for
example.  The Act, however, imposes this duty upon speakers
who will either be unable, or find it extremely burdensome,
to implement an access control system they would not
otherwise establish.  The critical distinction is between
speaker-chosen and government-imposed restrictions.

In addition to these technologies that allow individual
parents to control what their children can access, products
such as the Netscape Proxy Server and WEBTrack provide
schools and businesses the ability to block specific sites
from access by all users on the network, and to track and
monitor use of the Internet.

  60.  The World Wide Web Consortium is one of a number of
organizations of computer scientists and engineers who confer
to agree upon technical protocols and standards to be used
within the Internet.  These defined standards and protocols
are what allow the diverse and otherwise incompatible
computers across the world to "internetwork" with each other.

  61.  See generally Vezza Dec., Tab 35 (detailing PICS
standard and operations).

  63.  Sable 492 U.S. at 128; accord Bolger v. Youngs Drug
Products Corp. 463 U.S. 60, 73 (1983).

  64.  Thus, this bedrock principle has already been applied
in the context of sale or distribution of books and other
printed materials (Butler), use of the postal service to mail
unsolicited commercial advertisements to homes (Bolger), and
use of the telephone to sell prerecorded commercial telephone
messages (Sable).

  65.  The Supreme Court has stressed that in applying this
test it is important to consider whether other private or
governmental alternatives, short of a ban -- already serve to
protect children.  If so, the advancement of the governmental
interest served by the ban will be marginal.  See Sable, 492
U.S. at 129 (no showing that other means do not afford
similar protection without such infringement); Bolger, 463
U.S. at 73 (ban "provides only the most limited incremental
support" because parents can exercise substantial control 
without any governmental involvement, and other laws afford
control over unwanted receipt of materials); Butler, 352 U.S.
at 383 n.* (noting other criminal laws covering same topic
short of ban).

Union, 115 S. Ct. 1003, 1014 (1995); Fabulous Assoc., 896
F.2d at 785 ("The First Amendment protects against government
inhibition as well as prohibition.") (quotation omitted).

  71.  Of course, Congress is not required to make findings
or hold hearings, and the absence of findings or hearings is
not, by itself, sufficient reason to hold an Act of Congress
unconstitutional.  But it is the government's burden to
justify any law that abridges interests protected by the
First Amendment, and as the Supreme Court has noted, the
absence of findings of fact or hearings decreases the
likelihood the government will be able to meet that burden. 
See Sable, 492 U.S. at 129-30.

  72.  In Sable, the Court unanimously struck down 47 U.S.C.
  223(b), which banned all "indecent" commercial telephone
messages.  The Court found that "the congressional record
presented to us contains no evidence as to how effective or
ineffective the FCC's most recent regulations [permitting
technological defenses to liability for generating indecent
messages] were or might prove to be" with respect to
indecency.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 130 (emphasis in original). 
Instead, the record contained only

     conclusory statements during the debates by proponents
     of the bill . . . that under the FCC regulations minors
     could still have access to dial-a-porn messages . . . . 
     No Congressman or Senator purported to present a
     considered judgment with respect to how often or to what
     extent minors could or would circumvent the rules and
     have access to dial-a-porn messages.

Id. at 129-30.  Because a lesser burden on speech may have
been available, Congress' lack of findings doomed the
indecency ban:  "For all we know from this record, the FCC's
technological approach to restricting dial-a-porn messages to
adults who seek them would be extremely effective . . . if
this is the case, it seems to us that   223(b) is not a
narrowly tailored effort . . . ."  Id. at 130-31.

  75.  Except insofar as it applies to obscenity and child
pornography (and hence is redundant of existing obscenity and
child pornography laws), subsection (d) "`simply has no core'
of constitutionally unprotected expression to which it might
be limited."  City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 468
(1987) (quoting Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S 566, 578 (1974)).

  76.  In many overbreadth cases, the First Amendment
plaintiff (often a criminal defendant) relies exclusively
upon the challenged law's effects upon the free speech rights
of persons not before the court.  See, e.g., Massachusetts v.
Oakes, 491 U.S. 576, 581 (1989).  Here, although the Act
directly violates plaintiffs' own First Amendment rights in a
variety of ways, the certainty that the Act's "very
existence" will "cause others not before the court to refrain
from constitutionally protected speech or expression,"
Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612 (1973), underlines
the need to invalidate subsection (d) on its face.

  77.  Notwithstanding the government's power to restrict
distribution to minors of non-obscene materials with prurient
appeal, see Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968), and to
regulate the use of profane language that could disrupt the
educational environment, see Bethel School District No. 403
v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675 (1986), it is extremely doubtful
whether the government could flatly ban -- as the Act
purports to do -- the distribution of sexually oriented but
truthful scientific or educational matter (e.g., information
on "safer sex" or AIDS) from children (particularly older
minors).  Statutes that restrict "`the free flow of truthful
information,'" suffer from "a `basic' constitutional defect
regardless of the strength of the government's interest.'" 
Bolger, 463 U.S. at 75 (quoting Linmark v. Willingboro, 431
U.S. 85, 95-96 (1977)) (emphasis added).  Nor are we aware of
any modern precedent holding that the government can withhold
even from minors works of serious literary value on the
ground that they are indecent.

  78.  "In assessing whether a minor has the requisite
capacity for individual choice the age of the minor is a
significant factor."  Ernoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422
U.S. 205, 214 n.11 (1975) (citing Rowan v. Post Office Dep't,
397 U.S. 728, 741 (1970)).  For example, Web sites or
discussion groups on the subjects of sexually transmitted
diseases, "safe sex," or contemporary novels that would be
inappropriate for a 7-year-old Internet user might well be
entirely appropriate for high school or college students who
are 17.  The Act, however, prohibits anyone from making such
resources available to anyone under 18.  It also makes 
sexual candor or vulgarity in a private e-mail exchange
between 17-year-olds -- an exchange that would be entitled to
complete First Amendment protection if conducted through the
United States mail -- a series of felonies.  See  
223(a)(1)(B), (d).

  79.  The constitutional difficulties with the Act's
undifferentiating age line would be present even if the
subsection (e)(5) blocking provisions were feasible.

  80.  Mosher Dec.    6, 10, Tab 26; Boiss  Dec.   8, Tab 6.

  81.  The Act's sweep is far broader than that of the state
"harmful to minors" statute upheld in Ginsberg v. New York,
390 U.S. 629 (1968).  That statute banned the sale to persons
under 17 of sex-related pictures of which the predominant
appeal was to the "prurient, shameful or morbid interest of
minors," that was "patently offensive" according to adults'
community standards about what was inappropriate for
children, and that was "utterly without redeeming social
importance for minors."  Id. at 646.  The instant Act, in
contrast, contains no "prurient appeal" or "redeeming
importance" requirements.

  82.  See Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968)
(upholding ban on sale to persons under 17 of material
obscene as to minors; statute imposed no restrictions on
sales to adults); Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380 (1957)
(statute banning sale of materials tending to corrupt youth
invalid because it prevented adult access); American
Booksellers v. Webb, 919 F.2d 1493, 1502 (11th Cir. 1990) (in
evaluating constitutionality of state law forbidding open
display of material harmful to minors "the crucial inquiry .
. . is whether the restriction on adults' access to protected
speech is unnecessarily burdensome, or `significant,' or,
stated differently, whether alternate modes of adult access
are unduly restricted."); Upper Midwest Booksellers v. City
of Minneapolis, 780 F.2d 1389, 1395 (8th Cir. 1985)
(bookstore display restrictions designed to restrict
children's access to sexually oriented material upheld
because it did not "unduly burden the First Amendment rights
of adults"); M.S. News Co. v. Casado, 721 F.2d 1281, 1288
(10th Cir. 1983) (upholding law requiring bookstores to
employ "blinder racks" for adult materials because it "does
not unreasonably restrict adults' access to material which is
not obscene as to them").  

  83.  Pacifica is one of a series of Supreme Court decisions
holding that unique characteristics of the broadcast medium
justify a degree of government content regulation that would
not be permitted elsewhere.  See id. 438 U.S. at 748.  Thus,
for example, the Court has permitted federal regulators to
override broadcasters' programming preferences to ensure that
listeners and viewers "receive suitable access to social,
political, esthetic, moral, and other ideas and experiences." 
Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 390 (1969). 
The Court has explained the special First Amendment standard
by reference to four special characteristics of broadcast
media:  scarcity of frequencies, intrusiveness, easy
accessibility for children, including "even those too young
to read," and difficulty of viewer control.  See Pacifica,
438 U.S. at 748-50; Red Lion, 395 U.S. at 388; National
Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, 226 (1943). 
None of these characteristics applies to cyberspace.

  84.  Even in the e-mail setting, recipients must
affirmatively "open" their mail in order to read the full
message.

  85.  Berners-Lee Dec.   9, Tab 4; Bradner Dec.    3, 6, 8,
Tab 7.

  86.  As one scholar has commented, the Turner Court's
refusal to extend the scarcity rationale to cable television,
see 114 S. Ct. at 2456-58, "suggests that new technologies
will generally be subject to ordinary free speech standards,
not to the more lenient standards applied to broadcasting." 
Cass R. Sunstein, The First Amendment in Cyberspace, 104 Yale
L.J. 1757, 1769 (1995).

  87.  Moreover, online content providers, like publishers in
the print medium, have no control over an individual's access
to expression in cyberspace.  See Turner 114 S.Ct. at 2466. 
Cyberspace, including the Internet, is owned by no one and
controlled by no one and there exists no bottleneck or
gatekeeper through which the expression must pass.  Although
services such as AOL, Compuserve, the Microsoft Network, and
Prodigy provide subscribers both content and access to the
Internet, once the subscribers access the Internet, these
services have no control over the content that is available. 
Moreover, the subscribers have a wide variety of avenues to
access expression on the Internet and other interactive
computer services; unlike with cable, they are not limited to
one physical connection running into their home.  Cf. Turner,
114 S.Ct. at 2466.  In cyberspace, there is no "potential for
abuse of . . . private power" over "the free flow of
information and ideas."  Id.

  88.  See Jerry Berman and Daniel J. Weitzner, "Abundance
And User Control:  Renewing the Democratic Heart Of The First
Amendment In The Age Of Interactive Media," 104 Yale L.J.
1619 (1995).

associational interests in cyberspace).

First Amendment in Cyberspace," 104 Yale L.J. 1757, 1784. 
(canvassing these and other existing uses of interactive
computer services to enhance political deliberation, and
observing that cyberspace offers new possibilities for
political candidates of modest means to compete for the minds
of the citizenry).

  91.  See generally Eugene Volokh, "Cheap Speech and What It
Will Do," 104 Yale L.J. 1805 (1995).

  92.  "Computer coffee shops" are rapidly proliferating,
where for less than it would cost to xerox 50 copies of a
paper message, an individual could make that same message
available through the Internet to 40 million people. 
Moreover, most universities now provide free access to the
Internet for their students.  And public libraries across the
country provide free access to the Internet for library
patrons.  See, e.g., Barrett Dec.   4, Tab 1; Boiss  Dec.
  4, Tab 6; Vaughn Dec.   5, Tab 34. 

  93.  See, e.g., Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman
Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489 (1982); Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S.
566 (1974); Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104 (1972);
Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156 (1972).

  94.  The government is wrong in asserting plaintiffs must
demonstrate that "'no set of circumstances exists under which
the Act would be valid.'"  Deft ACLU Br. at 40 (quoting Rust
v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 183 (1991)).  The Supreme Court
has explained that the higher certainty requirement permits
the Court "to invalidate [for vagueness] a criminal statute
on its face even when it could conceivably have had some
valid applications."  Kolender, 461 U.S. at 358 n.8 (emphasis
added).

  95.  See Barret Dec.   6, Tab 1; Bendall Dec.   4, Tab 2;
Bennett Dec.   11, Tab 3; Boiss  Dec.   7, Tab 6; Croneberger
Dec.   4, Tab 13; Fagin Dec. at 1, Tab 15; Geiman Dec.   9,
Tab 17; Grenquist Dec.   12, Tab 18; Guttenberg Dec.   12,
Tab 19; Hammer Dec.   3, Tab 20; Ketter Dec.   9, Tab 22;
Krug Dec.   6, Tab 23; Mitchell Dec.   9, Tab 25; Mosher Dec.
  2, Tab 26; Schwartzman Dec.   8, Tab 27; Scorza Dec.   5,
Tab 28; Shelkrot Dec.   3, Tab 29; Teicher Dec.   6, Tab 33;
Weisberg Dec.   10, Tab 36; Wheaton Dec., Tab 38, Ex. A, B;
Wolf Dec.   8, Tab 39; 

  96.  In contrast to obscenity law, where expression must
pertain to statutorily specified "sexual conduct" in order to
be "obscene," Miller, 413 U.S. at 24 & n.6, the Act refers
obliquely, and more broadly, to "sexual or excretory
activities," without further explanation or specificity.  See
  223(d)(1)(B).  The vagueness of these terms is another
basis for finding the Act violative of the Fifth Amendment.

  97.  Although to any ordinary person the terms might be
understood to have different meanings, Congress apparently
intended that the "indecent" standard of subsection (a) and
the "patently offensive" standard of subsection (d) have the
same meaning.  See Conf. Report at 188 (noting that "section
223(d)(1) codifies the definition of indecency from
[Pacifica].").

  98.  In Pacifica, the Court examined the FCC's enforcement
of an "indecency" standard which the FCC had interpreted to
mean "language that describes, in terms patently offensive as
measured by contemporary community standards for the
broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities and organs
at times of the day when there is a reasonable risk that
children may be in the audience."  438 U.S. at 732 (emphasis
added) (internal quotations omitted).  The Court stressed it
was upholding the FCC's determination that the "language as
broadcast was indecent."  Id. (emphasis added); accord id. at
734 (confining holding to review of FCC's judgment as to "the
monologue 'as broadcast'"); id. at 735 ("the focus of our
review must be on the Commission's determination that the
Carlin monologue was indecent as broadcast").  See also In re
Regulations Governing Indecent Communications by Telephone,
Gen. Dkt. No. 90-64,   12 (rel. June 29, 1990) (FCC "dial-a-
porn" indecency standard refers to contemporary community
standards "for the telephone medium").

  99.  The FCC has argued that its standard for broadcast is
valid because it has "general expertise in broadcast matters"
and therefore can adjudicate whether a particular broadcast
is "indecent" under the broadcast test.  In re Sagittarius
Broadcasting Corp., 7 F.C.C.R. 6873, 6876 (1992).  However,
neither the FCC, nor any other federal agency, has any
comparable "expertise in [computer] matters," and the Act
expressly denies the FCC the authority to enforce its
provisions. See 47 U.S.C.   223(d)(6).

  100.  Indeed, a speaker would have to consider whether the
"least common denominator" is the least tolerant local
community in the world, since, as Congress recognized, this
is "a global, medium."  Conf. Report at 191.  Communications
entirely appropriate for New York City may be deemed
inappropriate for Salt Lake City, and grossly inappropriate
for Saudi Arabia.

  101.  See, e.g., Croneberger Dec.   4, Tab 13; Geimann Dec.
  10, Tab 17; Hammer Dec.   3, Tab 20; Jacobson Dec.   9, Tab
21; Krug Dec.   6, Tab 23; Mosher Dec.   2, Tab 26; Scorza
Dec.   7, Tab 28; Shelkrot Dec.   3, Tab 29; Teicher Dec.
  6, Tab 33. 

  102.  Mosher Dec.    4-8, Tab 26.

  103.  Hammer Dec.   6, Tab 20.

  104.  Teicher Dec.   7, Tab 33.

  105.  Scorza Dec.   8, Tab 28.

  106.  Schwartzman Dec.    4-7, Tab 27; Weitzner Dec.    10-
12, Tab 37.

  107.  The Conference Report unhelpfully states nothing more
than that the methods need not be "100%" effective.  But it
gives no indication of what level of "ineffectiveness" the
jury should tolerate.  See Conf. Rep. at 190.

  108.  This is particularly so because this defense, and all
of the Act's defenses, are only defenses which must be raised
and proved after the speaker has already been subjected to
prosecution.  Even speakers who believe their actions will
ultimately be found to constitute a defense may be deterred
from speaking in order to avoid the humiliation, stigma, and
expense of defending a criminal prosecution.  

  109.  If the Act is not enjoined, many content providers
will remove speech from the Internet in order to avoid
criminal prosecution.  See, e.g., Bendall Dec.   4, Tab 2;
Bennett Dec.   13, Tab 3; Blum Dec.   8, Tab 5; Croneberger
Dec.   7, Tab 13; Gieman Dec.   8, Tab 17; Guttenberg Dec.
  14, Tab 19; Ketter Dec.   10, Tab 22; Krug Dec.   13-15,
Tab 23; Mosher Dec.   9, Tab 26; Scorza Dec.   10, Tab 28;
Stonesifer Dec.   5, Tab 32; Teicher Dec.   9, Tab 33;
Weisberg Dec.   10, Tab 36; Weitzner Dec.   12, Tab 37.

  110.  There is no discussion of this defense in the
Conference Report.

  111.  See supra n.43.

  112.  The Act fails to specify whether there can be more
than one "content provider" of, or person who "displays" or
"posts," any particular communication.  

  113.  The government agrees the access provider defenses
should be broadly construed, so the only question before the
Court is how broadly.  See Deft ACLU Br. at 49, n.35.

  114.  Defendants erroneously rely on Hohe for the
proposition that denial of First Amendment rights does not
necessarily constitute irreparable harm.  See Deft ACLU Br.
at 20.  Hohe involved a challenge by nonunion members to the
union's procedures for collection of a fee charged for acting
as the collective bargaining representative.  Hohe, 868 F.2d
at 71 & n.1.  Although the Hohe plaintiffs raised a claim
grounded on the First Amendment, the court held that, because
the alleged injury was merely a monetary one, it was fully
remediable at law and thus not irreparable.  Id. at 72-73. 
That is clearly not the case here.

  115.  Defendants, in an effort to contend that the Act's
chilling effect on plaintiffs' freedom of expression does not
amount to irreparable harm, quote (out of context) cases
involving the jurisdictional "case or controversy"
requirement.   See Deft ACLU Br. at 19 (citing Younger v.
Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 42 (1971) and Babbitt v. United Farm
Workers National Union, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979)).  There is
no question, however, that plaintiffs have standing to bring
this pre-enforcement facial challenge to the Act.  See
Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, Inc., 484 U.S. 383,
392 (1988) (concluding bookstores have standing to challenge
law criminalizing display of books harmful to minors because
"the law is aimed directly at plaintiffs, who, if their
interpretation of the statute is correct, will have to take
significant and costly compliance measures or risk criminal
prosecution.").

(1) LANDMARK PRIVACY LEGISLATION INTRODUCED IN SENATE 
   
Bill Would Ensure Confidentiality of Medical Records

Landmark privacy legislation designed to protect the confidentiality of 
medical records was introduced today in the Senate by Senators Robert 
Bennett (R-UT), Robert Dole (R-KS), Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), Edward 
Kennedy (D-MA), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT).  If enacted, the "Medical 
Records Confidentiality Act" would create strong, comprehensive, privacy 
safeguards for the health data of all Americans.  Similar legislation 
has been introduced in the House by Representative Gary Condit (D-CA). 

As CDT Deputy Director Janlori Goldman stated during a press conference 
announcing the Introduction of the bill, "the Medical Records 
Confidentiality Act is desperately needed to close a gaping hole in 
current law that leaves peoples' most personal, sensitive information 
extremely vulnerable to abuse and misuse.  Strong protections are needed 
to safeguard peoples' health records as the information moves on the 
Global information highway.  Congress must seize the opportunity to pass 
this bill this session."  Towards this end, CDT has organized a broad 
range of privacy and consumer advocates, along with representatives from 
the health care and information industries to work towards its passage. 
(see attached letter below) 

The 'Medical Records Confidentiality Act' would:

*  Give people the right to see, copy, and correct their own medical 
   records; 

*  Limit disclosure of personal health information by requiring an 
   individual's permission prior to disclosure of his or her health 
   information by doctors, insurance companies, and other health 
   information 'trustees' (e.g.: researchers and public heath 
   departments);
        
*  Require the development of security guidelines for the use and 
   disclosure of personal health information; and
        
*  Impose strict civil penalties and criminal sanctions for violations 
   of the Act, and provide individuals with a private right of action 
   against those who mishandle their personal medical information. 

CDT believes that strong uniform privacy rules for the handling of 
personal health data are critical to ensuring public trust and 
confidence in the emerging health information infrastructure.  Recent 
studies by the Institute of Medicine and the Office of Technology 
Assessment have shown that state laws are inadequate to protect peoples' 
health records, and that a federal law is needed to address this 
shortfall.

More information, including the text of the bill and a section-by-
section summary, are available from CDT's Health Information Privacy web 
page (URL:http://www.cdt.org/health_priv.html).

BACKGROUND -- THE NEED FOR MEDICAL RECORDS PRIVACY PROTECTIONS

The public is continually told that increased data collection, linkage 
and sharing is necessary to improve the quality of health care and 
reduce costs. Yet without giving individuals confidence that their most 
sensitive personal information will be protected, we risk falling short 
of these health reform goals.  If people don't trust the health care 
system to maintain the confidentiality of personal health information, 
they will be reluctant to fully participate.  A 1993 Lou Harris poll 
shows that a majority of Americans favors new, comprehensive legislation 
to protect the privacy of medical records.  The poll found that nearly 
50 million people believe their own medical records have been improperly 
disclosed.

It is no wonder individuals are nervous about the privacy of their 
health information.  One need only read the paper to learn about leaks 
of the sensitive health information of politicians, sports figures, and 
celebrities.  The ordeals of Representative Nydia Velazquez (D-NY) and 
the late tennis star Arthur Ashe expose the dire consequences that can 
occur when health information is wrongly disclosed.  Both Velazquez and 
Ashe suffered the disclosure of the most private intimate details of 
their lives -- a suicide attempt and HIV infection respectively -- to 
the world.  

Public figures are not the only victims of unauthorized, egregious 
disclosures. The average American also suffers from leaks of sensitive 
medical information.  Recently,  information on the HIV status, drug-
abuse history, and sexual practices of volunteers at an Ohio Health 
Department's AIDS prevention unit was wrongly disclosed.  Following 
another breach of confidential information, the office closed for 
retraining.  

Weak security also leads to unauthorized internal access and misuse of 
peoples' health records.  In March of this year, a 13-year-old daughter 
of a hospital clerk printed out the names and phone numbers of patients 
who had been treated at the University of Florida's Medical Center.  As 
a hoax, the 13-year old girl then contacted seven patients and 
erroneously told them they were infected with HIV.  After receiving one 
of these prank calls, a young girl attempted suicide believing she had 
the HIV virus.

CDT believes that the Medical Records privacy act is the most important 
privacy bill since the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 
(ECPA).  Furthermore, enacting health information privacy legislation is 
a critical first step in health care reform.  The Medical Records 
Confidentiality Act is supported by nearly everyone with a stake in the 
debate.  If passed, CDT believes the legislation will go a long way to 
restore the public's faith and confidence in the integrity and security 
of our nation's health care system.

NEXT STEPS:

The bill has been referred to the Senate Labor and Human Resources 
Committee (Chaired by Sen. Kassebaum (R-KS), a co-sponsor).  Committee 
hearings are scheduled for mid-November, and the bill is expected to be 
considered by the full Senate early in 1996.  Similar legislation is 
pending in the House (HR 435, sponsored by Rep. Condit (D-CA).

(2) CDT LED COALITION LETTER IN SUPPORT OF BENNETT BILL

October 20, 1995

Senator Robert Bennett
431 Dirksen Senate Office Bldg
Washington, DC 20510

Dear Senator Bennett:

We write to express our appreciation and strong support for your efforts 
to enact a comprehensive privacy law to protect personal health 
information. We believe that safeguarding the privacy of peoples' health 
information is a necessary and critical component of health care reform. 
As the health system's infrastructure grows increasingly automated, it 
is essential that people have confidence that their participation in the 
health care system does not mean the loss of their privacy.

Although we are still in the process of resolving certain issues in the 
draft Medical Records Confidentiality Act developed by your office, a 
substantial consensus has emerged on the central policy of providing 
Americans uniform, strong confidentiality protection for their health 
information.

We look forward to continuing to work with you on this important bill.

Sincerely,

(1) UPDATE: CONFEREES CLOSE TO DECISION ON CYBERPORN ISSUE

>From all accounts,  the telecom conferees are beginning to focus on the
net-censorship issue at the staff level, and a decision could be reached
in the next two weeks.

CDT has learned that the conferees are looking at several different
approaches to dealing with the issue, and at this point all but one
(White) look pretty grim. These are:

(1) A MODIFIED EXON PROPOSAL: Includes the CDA, the House-passed
    manager's amendments which prohibit sending indecent material
    online, and the Cox/Wyden bill.

(2) THE HYDE/CHRISTIAN COALITION PROPOSAL: Rep. Hyde has endorsed a
    proposal offered by conservative religious groups in October (the
    so-called Reed, Schafly, Meese proposal, circulated on the net a
    few weeks ago). This proposal is more restrictive than the Exon
    proposal

(3) THE GRASSLEY PROPOSAL: Conceptually similar to S. 892, the
    Grassley/Dole 'Protection of Children from Computer Pornography
    Act'. Among other things, the bill would create broad liability for
    online indecency for both content providers and online service
    providers, without any clear limitation.

(4) COX/WYDEN/WHITE: Rep. Rick White (R-WA), an original co-sponsor of
    Cox/Wyden, is preparing an alternative to the 3 proposals above. No
    word yet on what it will contain, although it is expected to focus
    on parental empowerment as opposed to unconstitutional indecency
    restrictions and government regulation of online speech.

Unfortunately, none of the three current proposals on the table (EXON,
HYDE, and GRASSLEY), offer much hope. The fourth, WHITE, does not yet
exist, though the reports we have received indicate that it is likely to be
more reasonable and workable than the others.

Below is an overview of the current status of the issue and an analysis of
the three current proposals.


CURRENT STATUS OF CONFERENCE
----------------------------

A House/Senate conference committee is now in the process of reconciling
the differences between the Senate-passed Exon/Coats CDA and the
House-passed Cox/Wyden bill. Unfortuately, and despite the overwhelming
victory of Cox/Wyden, the reports indicate that the CDA is sill very much
alive.

Because the Senate passed the CDA, and because Exon is a member of the
conference committee, Exon has the necessary leverage and support to push
for his proposal. The same holds true on the House side, where the
principal supporter of the Cox/Wyden position is Rep. Rick White.
Ultimately, the conferees will have to decide how much of each proposal to
accept.

The situation is complicated by the introcution of two new, even more
restrictive proposals (Hyde and Grassley). These proposals have the support
of the Christian Coalition (an influential group with many Republicans on
the conference), meaning that we face a steep, uphill battle in the next
few weeks.


OVERVIEW OF EXON, HYDE, AND GRASSLEY PROPOSALS
----------------------------------------------

Below is an overview of how the 3 proposals treat several of the key
issues, including the use of the indecency standard, the 'display' of
indecent material online, FCC oversight of cyberspace, vicarious liability
for service providers, preemption of inconsistent state laws, and defenses
for service providers.

I. INDECENCY

All three seeks to prohibit indecent material on the Internet or other
interactive media. As mentioned above, indecency is a broad classification
of material including sexually explicit material, the '7 dirty words', and
even classic works of fiction such as The Catcher In the Rye or Ulysses. As
we have long argued, indecency restrictions on the Internet are
unconstitutional given the tremendous amounts of control users have over
the material they receive.

EXON:     Prohibits creating, transmitting, or making available any
          indecent material to anyone under 18 (Sec 402 (a) - (e)).
          Violators face $100,000 fines and up to 2 years in jail

HYDE:     Criminalizes transmission or display of indecent material to
          anyone under 18 (amendment to 18 USC 1465). Creates $100,000
          fines and 2 years in jail for anyone who makes or makes
          available any indecent material to a minor (Sec 402 (d)).

GRASSLEY: Punishes 'Content Providers" who knowingly make an indecent
          communication to anyone under 18 (Sec (3)).

          Also punishes "Access Providers' who 'willfully' provide a
          minor with access to a computer communications facility on
          which indecent communications are available (Sec. (f)).

          Violators face $100,000 fines and up to 2 years in jail


II. 'DISPLAY CRIME'

All three proposals seek to prohibit the 'display' of indecent material in
various ways. They are modeled on the concept of 'brown paper bags' or
other blinders which cover adult magazines at 7-11 type stores, though in
the online context the current proposals are much more restrictive and
would apply to individual content providers (not just the owner of the
store).

These provisions would apply to web pages, ftp and gopher archives, usenet
newsgroups, etc.

EXON:     Prohibits the display of indecent material to minors (Sec
          (e)(1)). Violators face $100,000 fines and 2 years in jail.

HYDE:     Prohibits the display of indecent material to minors (Sec
          402 (d)). Violators face $100,000 fines and 2 years in jail.
          Proposal is identical to Exon described above.

GRASSLEY: Prohibits the display of indecent material to minors (Sec
          (e)), as well as knowingly allowing a minor access to a
          computer network on which indecent material is available (Sec
          (f)). Under this provision, anyone who allows a minor access
          to the Internet, including an online service provider or even
          the child's parent, could go to jail if they "know"
          indecent material is available and allow a minor acess.


III.    FCC ROLE

Two of the new proposals would grant the FCC new authority to regulate
cyberspace.

EXON:     Grants the FCC jurisdiction over online speech and over
          blocking and filtering technologies (Sec (f)(1) - (4).

HYDE:     Grants the FCC broad authority over online speech and over
          blocking and filtering technologies (Sec (e)(1)).

GRASSLEY: No FCC role proposed.


IV.     VICARIOUS LIABILITY FOR CARRIERS

All three proposals would hold carriers criminally liable merely for
transmitting content created by others. Holding carriers liable for content
on their networks would (1) force carriers to ensure that their networks
are not being used to transmit prohibited material (creating a free speech
and privacy nightmare), or (2) remove all incentives for those carriers who
may wish to exercise limited editorial control over their networks to act
responsibly.


EXON:     Amends 18 USC 1465 to prohibit 'transmission' by computer of
          indecent material to minors. This provision could be read to
          apply to apply to service providers (Sec. 410).

HYDE:     Similar to Exon proposal, amendments to 18 USC 1465 would
          prohibit 'transmission' by computer of indecent material to
          minors. This provision could be read to apply to service
          providers.

GRASSLEY: Would hold access providers liable for knowingly providing
          minors access to a computer service on which indecent material
          is available (sec (f)).


V.      PREEMPTION

More and more states are attempting to pass their own net-censorship bills.
Some are more restrictive than others. However, because interactive media
is interstate and international, entire networks will be forced to adhere
to the most restrictive standards unless Congress enacts a uniform national
policy and pre-empts states from enforcing inconsistent or incompatible
regulations.

The pre-emption provisions vary between the three proposals:

EXON:     Pre-empts states from imposing liability on commercial
          entities, nonprofit libraries and schools. However, states
          could enact tougher restrictions on individual users, BBS's,
          non-profit organizations, and non-profit computer networks
          (freenets) (Sec. (g)

HYDE:     Contains no pre-emption of state laws, allowing states to
          impose stricter regulations and even enact inconsistent laws.

GRASSLEY: Explicitly prohibits pre-emption. States would be free to
          enact any restrictions, even if they are more restrictive (Sec
          (I)).


VI. DEFENSES

All three proposals contain defenses designed to protect service providers
from liability in certain circumstances. While we have long held the
position that defenses are important (since holding service providers
liable for their subscribers content creates huge problems for free speech
and privacy), it is not clear that all these defenses will work as
advertised.

EXON:     (1) No control -- Providers cannot be held liable for
              providing access to material if the provider has no
              control over the material (Sec (f)(1)).

          (2) FCC Determination Of Good Faith -- Providers cannot be
              held liable if they have taken good faith actions, as
              prescribed by the FCC, to restrict access to prohibited
              material (Sec. (f)(3)).

          (3) Employers -- Employers will not be held liable for the
              actions of an employee's activities online (unless the
              conduct is part of their job or the employer authorizes
              it) (Sec (f)(2)).

HYDE:     (1) FCC Determination Of Good Faith -- No liability if a
              person has complied with regulations designed to restrict
              access to indecent communications to those under 18 as
              enacted by the FCC, which is required to prepare final
              regulations 120 days after passage of the bill.

              No other defenses are offered.

GRASSLEY: (1) Defense for Screening -- The proposal creates a defense
              to prosecution if a person has taken good faith efforts to
              restrict or prevent the transmission of or access to
              indecent materials (Sec. (g))

          (2) Employers -- Employers will not be held liable for the
              actions of an employee's activities online (unless the
              conduct is part of their job or the employer authorizes
              it) (Sec. h)

SUMMARY
-------

While this may all seem pretty bleak, all is not lost just yet. As
mentioned earlier, Rep. Rick White (R-WA) is reportedly about to offer an
alternative to the Exon/Hyde/Grassley proposals. The White proposal is
expected to be based on the Cox/Wyden/White 'parental empowerment'
approach.

However, even if the White approach is, as expected, preferable to the 3
alternatives, the fact that Exon, Hyde, and Grassley are all pushing more
restrictive proposals means that it is unlikely we will come out of this
with everything we want. The Christian Coalition is too powerful,
especially with the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee on their
side, to not have some influence on the final outcome of this debate.

We have a great deal of work ahead of us. Once the White proposal is
available, we will be able to get a better sense of our chances for
salvaging a palatable outcome. We will keep you informed of developments as
they occur.

BACKGROUND
----------

As you know, the House and Senate have passed two very different approaches
to dealing with objectionable material online as part of a massive
telecommunications reform bill.

In June, the Senate passed the Exon/Coats CDA, which would create a crime
for transmitting or displaying indecent material online. "Indecent"
material is a vague and constitutionally suspect classification of material
which includes everything from sexually explicit material to the '7 dirty
words', to the text of classic works of fiction such as Catcher in the Rye.
In addition, the Exon/Coats CDA would grant the FCC broad authority to
regulate online speech as well as the underlying technology of the Internet
and other interactive media.

In August, the House passed the Cox/Wyden/White 'Internet Freedom and
Family Empowerment Act'. Cox/Wyden/White would prohibit the FCC from
imposing content or other regulations on the Internet or other interactive
media, remove disincentives which prohibit online service providers from
deploying blocking and filtering applications, and create a uniform
national policy of user control, rather than government censorship, for
addressing objectionable material online. However, the House also passed
the so-called 'Managers Amendments', which would criminalize sending
indecent material to a minors.

(1) HOUSE PASSES COX/WYDEN 'INTERNET FREEDOM' AMENDMENT 
    MAJOR VICTORY FOR CYBERSPACE -- INDECENCY STATUTES REMAIN A MAJOR 
    ISSUE

By a overwhelming vote of 420 to 4, the US House of Representatives 
today approved the 'Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment' amendment, 
sponsored by Reps. Chris Cox (R-CA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR), which would 
prohibit the federal government from regulating content on the Internet, 
commercial online services, and other interactive media.

Unlike the Senate-passed Exon/Coats Communications Decency Act (CDA), 
the Cox/Wyden amendment ensures that individuals and parents can decide 
for themselves what information they or their children receive. By 
contrast, the Exon/Coats CDA would grant the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) broad powers to regulate the expression of each and 
every one of the millions of users of the Internet. 

The Cox/Wyden amendment:

* Prohibits the FCC from imposing content regulations on the Internet or 
  other interactive media.

* Removes disincentives for online service providers to exercise 
  editorial control over their networks and to provide blocking and 
  screening technologies to their uses.

* Seeks to create a uniform national policy prohibiting content 
  regulations in interactive media.

CDT believes that the Cox/Wyden amendment is an enlightened approach to
addressing the issue of children's access to objectionable material 
online. Unlike the Senate-passed CDA, the Cox/Wyden approach recognizes 
that the Internet is a global, decentralized network, with abundant 
capacity for content and tremendous user control. 

House passage of the Cox/Wyden amendment sets the stage for a direct 
battle between the House and Senate on the issue of government content 
regulation in interactive media. CDT will work vigorously to ensure that 
the Cox/Wyden amendment replaces the Exon/Coats CDA in the final version 
of telecommunications Reform legislation.

NEW UNCONSTITUTIONAL INDECENCY RESTRICTIONS ALSO APPROVED

Although the House vote today significantly advanced freedom of speech 
on the Internet, the threat of unconstitutional indecency restrictions
remains.

In a vote unrelated to the Cox/Wyden amendment, the House also approved
changes to federal obscenity laws which would criminalize the 
transmission of constitutionally protected speech online. These 
amendments were approved as part of the "Managers Amendment" to the 
Telecommunications reform bill (HR 1555). Although these amendments are 
more narrowly drawn than the Exon/Coats CDA or the Grassley/Dole 
"Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act (S. 892), they 
clearly violate the First Amendment and remain an issue of serious 
concern to CDT. 

The new criminal law amendments are opposed by several prominent members 
of both the House and Senate, including Cox and Wyden. As the bill makes 
its way through the House/Senate conference committee, CDT will work 
with Reps. Cox and Wyden, Senator Leahy, and others to:

* Remove the unconstitutional indecency restrictions added as part of
  the "Managers amendment"

* Ensure that the Cox/Wyden amendment replaces the Exon/Coats CDA in the 
  final telecommunications reform bill

* Clarify that the Cox/Wyden amendment does not affect privacy 
  protections under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)

* Strengthen provisions that pre-emption state online censorship laws.

COX/WYDEN AMENDMENT PROTECTS CYBERSPACE FROM GOVERNMENT INTRUSION,
RECOGNIZES PARENTAL CONTROL POSSIBILITIES

The Cox/Wyden bill seeks to accomplish four principal objectives:

* PROHIBIT FCC CONTENT REGULATION OF THE INTERNET AND INTERACTIVE
  COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. 

  The bill explicitly prohibits the Federal Communications Commission 
  from imposing or content or other regulations on the Internet or other 
  interactive communications services (Sec 2 (d)).

  This provision recognizes that Interactive media is different from 
  traditional mass media (such as broadcast radio and television), and 
  will enshrine in statue strong protections for all content carried on 
  the Internet and other interactive communications services. Instead of  
  relying on government censors to determine what is or is not
  appropriate for audiences, this provision recognizes that individuals 
  and parents are uniquely qualified to make those judgments.

* REMOVE DISINCENTIVES FOR ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO EXERCISE 
  EDITORIAL CONTROL OVER THEIR NETWORKS AND TO DEPLOY BLOCKING AND
  SCREENING TECHNOLOGIES FOR THEIR SUBSCRIBERS. 
 
  The bill would remove liability for providers of interactive   
  communications services who take good faith steps to restrict access 
  to obscene or indecent materials to minors or provide software or 
  hardware to enable their users to block objectionable material.(Sec 2
  (c))  In addition, the bill would overturn the recent court  decision  
  (Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co., N.Y. Sup. Ct. May 24, 
  1995) which held Prodigy liable for content on its network 
  because the service screens for sexually explicit material and 
  language.  Prodigy now faces a $200 million lawsuit. 

  The bill does not intend to create an obligation for providers to 
  monitor or screen content or to allow violation of Federal privacy 
  statutes (such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act), although 
  some concerns remain on these points. CDT remains committed to 
  addressing these concerns as the legislation moves to conference, and 
  has been assured by Rep. Cox and Wyden that these issues will be 
  addressed.

* PRE-EMPT INCONSISTENT STATE LAWS REGULATING CONTENT ON INTERACTIVE 
  COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. 

  The bill seeks to pre-empt States from enforcing inconsistent laws, 
  including restrictions on content available on interactive 
  communications services.  (Sec 2 (e)(2))

  The actual scope of this preemption remains an issue of some 
  discussion. CDT believes that any legislation in this area MUST 
  contain a strong pre-emption of inconsistent state laws. A patchwork 
  of state laws which impose varying, and in some cases contradictory, 
  obligations on service providers and content providers must be 
  avoided. CDT will work to ensure that the Cox/Wyden bill creates a 
  uniform national policy which prohibits states from imposing content 
  regulations on interactive media.

* NO EFFECT ON CRIMINAL LAW. 

  The bill is not intended to prevent the enforcement of the current 
  dial-a-porn statute or other Federal criminal statutes such as 
  obscenity, child pornography, harassment, etc. (Sec 2 (e)(1))

NET ACTIVISM A CRITICAL FACTOR

When Senator Exon (D-NE) first proposed the CDA in February 1995, the
net.community reacted with strong opposition. A coalition of online
activist organizations, including CDT, EFF, People for the American Way,
EPIC, the ACLU and organized with the Voters Telecommunications Watch
(VTW), worked tirelessly over the last six months to mobilize grass 
roots opposition to the CDA. Through our efforts of generating thousands 
of phone calls to Congressional offices and an online petition which 
generated over 100,000 signatures in support of an alternative to the 
CDA, the net.community was able to demonstrate that we are a political 
force to be reckoned with.

The net.campaign and public education efforts helped to encourage House
Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) to come out against the CDA, and was an
important factor in Reps. Cox and Wyden's decision to propose their
alternative. As the legislation moves to the conference committee and 
then on to final passage, the net.community must be prepared to continue 
to fight to ensure that the new criminal provisions are removed and that 
the Cox/Wyden amendment is not weakened.

GENESIS OF THE COX/WYDEN AMENDMENT

After the Senate passed the CDA by a vote of 84-16 on June 14, CDT 
stepped up our efforts to find an alternative which protected the First 
Amendment and recognized the unique nature of interactive media. Both on 
our own and through the Interactive Working Group (a group of over 80 
public interest organizations and leading computer and communications 
companies, content providers, and others, coordinated by CDT. The IWG 
includes the ACLU, People for the American Way, the Progress and Freedom 
Foundation, America Online, MCI, Compuserve and Prodigy, and many other 
organizations and corporations), worked directly with Reps. Cox and 
Wyden to bolster the case that parental control technologies offered an 
effective alternative to government content regulations. 

To this end, the IWG held a demonstration for members of Congress and 
the press in mid-July to demonstrate parental control feature of 
products offered by Netscape, SurfWatch, WebTrack, America Online, and 
Prodigy.

In addition, the IWG issued a comprehensive report reviewing current
technology and the state of current laws prohibiting trafficking in
obscenity, child pornography, stalking, threats, and other criminal 
conduct online (this report can be viewed on CDT's web site
URL:http://www.cdt.org/iwg/IWGrept.html).

Through these efforts and the efforts of VTW's online coalition, to 
educate members of the House about the problems with the Exon/CDA and 
the promise of interactive media, the House today has enacted an 
enlightened approach to dealing with children's access to inappropriate 
material online. Today's vote represents a tremendous victory for the 
first amendment and the promise of cyberspace.

NEXT STEPS

The House Telecommunications legislation (HR 1555) is expected to pass
later today (8/4). The Senate approved similar legislation (S. 652) in
June. Both bills now move to a House/Senate Conference Committee where
differences will be worked out. The Conference Committee is expected to
begin deliberation in early September. Once the Conference Committee 
agrees on a version of the bill, it will be sent back to both the House 
and Senate for final approval. This vote is expected to occur before the 
end of October.

The Internet-censorship provisions of the Senate bill are among the key
difference between the House and Senate proposals. However, several key
members of the Senate, including Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Russ
Feingold (D-WI) have expressed opposition to the Exon/Coats approach.  

CDT will fight vigorously throughout the remainder of this Congress to
ensure that the Exon/Coats CDA does not become law. We will also work to
remove the new unconstitutional criminal law amendments passed by the 
House today.

(1) Senate Passes Exon/Coats -- Battle Moves to House

The First Amendment was thrown out of cyberspace by the United States 
Senate today by a vote of 84 to 16 on passage of the Exon/Coats 
Communications Decency Act.

CDT remains adamantly opposed to this legislation, and we will continue 
to fight it as the bill moves to the House of Representatives. A House 
vote is expected in mid July.

In his effort to defeat the Exon amendment, Senator Leahy cited the 
over 35,000 signatures on the Internet petition, as well as the serious 
First Amendment and privacy concerns raised by the Exon proposal. 
Senator Feingold (D-WI) also spoke in opposition to the Exon amendment, 
and asked that the Senate consider the unique features of interactive media. 
Unfortunately, these efforts to protect the Internet from unnecessary and 
repressive censorship were not successful.

A full analysis of the Senate passed bill, as well as a description of 
the events that occurred today on the Senate floor will be posted in the 
next few days.

(1) SENS DOLE (R-KS) & GRASSLEY (R-IA) TO INTRODUCE SWEEPING ANTI-
    INDECENCY INTERNET CENSORSHIP BILL

OVERVIEW
--------

Senator Bob Dole (R-KS) is expected to up the ante on Internet 
censorship tomorrow by co-sponsoring legislation with Senator Charles 
Grassley (R-IA). The proposal to be offered by the Senate Majority 
leader and Republican Presidental candidate is more sweeping than the 
Exon Communicatons Decency Act, and comes on the heals of his recent 
attack on "sex and violence" in the entertainment industry.

The Dole/Grassley proposal represents an even greater threat to the 
First Amendment and the free flow of information in cyberspace than the 
Exon Communications Decency Act, now pending before the Senate (a vote 
on the CDA is expected as early as tomorrow, 6/7/95). Senator Dole is 
expected to announce his support for the bill at a 6/7 lunch hosted by 
the anti-pornography group Enough Is Enough. The text of the proposal is 
attached below.

Senator Grassley's staff has informed CDT that he bill will be 
introduced as a free standing bill and NOT AS AN AMENDMENT TO THE 
PENDING SENATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS REFORM BILL (S. 652). CDT hopes that 
the Dole/Grassley bill will not be fast-tracked (as was the Exon 
legislation), and that hearings will be held on the proposal.

The introduction of Dole/Grassley creates an even greater need for 
support of Senator Leahy's alternative (S. 714). If the Senate rejects 
Senator Leahy's alternative, it will pass either the Exon bill or the 
even more draconian Dole/Grassley proposal, and the net as we know it 
will never be the same again. To find out what you can do to help, 
contact the Voters Telecommunications Watch (VTW) by sending a message 
to vtw@vtw.org with a subject "send alert". Please also sign the 
petition (URL and instructions at the end of this post)


SUMMARY OF DOLE/GRASSLEY PROPOSAL
---------------------------------

The Dole/Grassley bill would create new penalties in Title 18 for all 
operators of electronic communications services who knowingly transmit 
indecent material to anyone under 18 years of age.  The bill would also 
create criminal liability for system operators who willfully permit 
minors to use an electronic communications service in order to obtain 
indecent material from another service. 

The Dole/Grassley bill would impose criminal liability on online service 
providers, electronic bulletin board operators, as well as any other 
entity that uses computer storage to deliver information to users, 
including video dialtone services, cable television video on demand 
services, etc.  The degree of knowledge required to impose liability is 
unclear, but it appears that an entity could be said to have the 
requisite knowledge if it is merely informed by a third party that some 
material on its system is indecent. The text of the proposal is 
available below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(2) SEN. LOTT (R-MISS) TO OFFER AMENDMENT TO STRIKE 'DEFENSES' SECTION 
    OF EXON CDA.

Senator Lott is preparing to offer an amendment to strike the service 
provider defenses from the Exon language already approved by the Senate 
Commerce committee.

Analysis:  Holding service providers such as America Online and Internet 
access providers liable for the content on their system over which they 
have no control will stifle the free flow of information in cyberspace 
and create major business risk for the private companies that are 
building the National Information Infrastructure.  Furthermore, placing 
criminal liability on service providers poses a serious risk to the 
privacy of individual users by forcing service providers to monitor 
communications in order to limit their own liability.

Status:  Lott plans to offer this amendment when the on the Senate floor 
when the telecommunications bill is being considered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(3) LEGISLATIVE UPDATE -- STATUS OF EXON CDA 

With the Senate telecommunications reform bill poised to go to the floor 
this week, proposals to censor the Internet are proliferating beyond 
just the Exon language.  The most sweeping and threatening proposals 
come from the Senate leadership and other Republicans.  The provisions 
of the Exon proposal that are already in the telecommunications bill 
contain restrictions on indecent communications which would apply to all 
parts of the Internet, commercial online services, and all other 
interactive media including interactive television, etc.  We believe 
these provisions to be unconstitutional and continue to oppose them.  
CDT continues to work with members of the Interactive Working Group in 
urging support for the Leahy study bill as an alternative.

The Exon proposal now part of the Senate telecommunications bill still
poses serious risks to free speech online.  The Exon proposal contains 
restrictions on "indecent" communications, which could ban all 
sexually-explicit communications on the Internet, along with all uses 
of the "seven dirty words."

Analysis:  CDT continues to argue that the indecency restrictions in the 
Exon bill are unconstitutional under the First Amendment. 

Status:  Senator Leahy plans to offer an amendment to strike the Exon 
provisions and replace them with his study bill (S.714) as an 
alternative.

CDT continues to work with members of the Interactive Working Group in 
urging support for the Leahy study as an alternative to the Exon bill, 
which we still believe to be unconstitutional.

CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman testified before the panel. Berman's testimony is available on CDT's online archives (URL's below).The bombing in Oklahoma City has brought the Internet under new scrutiny by Congress and the Clinton Administration. In his opening statement, Subcommittee Chair Arlen Spector (R-PA) made clear the First Amendment issues raised by government efforts to censor certain material in cyberspace. However, Spector acknowledged that the availability of so called "mayhem manuals" (one of which he displayed before the hearing) raises concerns about public safety and national security.Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), in his opening statement, urged caution and careful consideration of the benefits new communications technologies can bring before Congress rushes to restrict and limit its use."Before we head down a road that leads to censorship, we must think long and hard about its consequences. The same First Amendment that protects each of us and our right to think and speak as we choose, protects these others as well. The rule of this free society has long been that it is harmful and dangerous conduct, not speech, that justify adverse legal consequences", Leahy said.Senator Leahy, an opponent of Senator Exon's Communications Decency Act (S. 314), and strong advocate of freedom of speech and the free flow of information in cyberspace, recently introduced S. 714, an alternative to Senator Exon's bill (the text of Leahy's bill is available from CDT, URL below).Witnesses on the panel included:* Jerry Berman, Executive Director, Center For Democracy and Technology* Rabbi Marvin Hier, Dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center * Robert Litt, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, US Detp. of Justice* William Burrington, Assistant General Counsel. America Online* Prof. Frank Tuerkheimer, U. of Wisconsin Law SchoolWhat Does It Mean To "Shout Fire In Cyberspace?"-----------------------------------------------CDT's Jerry Berman acknowledged the availability of bomb-making instructions and terrorist manuals on the Internet, but argued that such materials deserve the same degree of protection as identical materials available in bookstores or libraries.   "As an open society, governed by the democratic principles of the First and Fourth Amendments, we tolerate and even encourage robust debate, advocacy and exchange of information on all subjects and in all media of expression, without exception.  Prior restraint or any government action which might chill speech have long been labeled intolerable, expect in the few circumstances in which that speech advocates imminent violence and is likely to produce such violence.  Even in these cases, Constitutional law and long-standing law enforcement policy have dictated great restraint in order to avoid chilling legitimate speech activity.""Justice Holmes taught that the First Amendment does not protect a person from punishment for "falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic,"  Schenk v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52 (1919), but what does it mean to "shout fire" in cyberspace?  We believe that shouting fire in cyberspace is actually far less threatening, and thus less deserving of censure, than the equivalent act in the physical world.  Though one can shout fire in an email message or on an Internet newsgroup, the likelihood that it will incite readers to imminent, criminal action is much reduced because the readers are dispersed around the country, and even around the world."Berman added,"The Center for Democracy and Technology believes that any prosecutorial or investigative activity must be predicated on speech **plus** a reasonable indication that the speech will lead to imminent violence.  Speech alone is not enough to prosecute or investigate in other media, and it should not be sufficient in interactive media.  Moreover, we assert that current law and the FBI's strict interpretation of the existing Attorney General investigative guidelines are adequate to serve both law enforcement purposes and First Amendment interests.In the sharpest exchange of the hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), expressed strong concern about the ability of children to access bomb-making material on the Internet. Visibly outraged by the testimony, Feinstein said, "I have a problem with people who use the First Amendment to teach others how to kill [other people]" Protecting such speech, "... is not what this country is about."CDT's Jerry Berman responded, "Excuse me, Senator, but that *is* what this nation is all about."  Feinstein countered that she believes that there is a " difference between free speech and teaching someone how to kill others", and suggested that the government should take a greater role in preventing the availability of such materials.Deputy Assistant Attorney General Robert Litt, agreeing with CDT's assertion that the First Amendment protects bomb-making manuals and other such material regardless of the medium of distribution, added that the Justice Department has the authority under current law to prosecute individuals who use the Internet to commit crimes relating to  "extortion, threats, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting the violation of other federal laws".  But Litt emphasized that such prosecutions must be predicated by **conduct**. Litt said:"We can, therefore, clearly act to punish conduct that falls within the scope of existing laws. But when we address not conduct but possibly protected speech, the power of law enforcement is restricted by the First Amendment. As the Committee well knows, we must guard the public's right to free speech even while protecting the public from criminal activity. The Constitution imposes stringent limits on our ability to punish the mere advocacy of principals or the mere dissemination of information, without more, even if the communications in question are utterly repugnant".However, the Justice Department staked out a more aggressive line on the issues of encryption and anonymity. On anonymity, Litt acknowledged the necessity of confidentiality for whistle-blowers and informants, but argued that the availability of complete anonymity on the Internet is of serious concern to law enforcement. In his prepared testimony, Litt echoed FBI Director Louis Freeh's recent comments that "... unless the encryption issue is adequately addressed, criminal communications over the telephone and the Internet will be will be encrypted and inaccessible to law enforcement even if a court has approved electronic surveillance," and pledged to continue to work to find solutions to this issue.In a statement which appears to dredge up previous arguments from the Department in support of the Clipper Chip government key escrow proposal, Litt said:"We believe that it is possible to deal with both of these issues -- encryption and anonymity.  Privacy rights should generally be protected, but society should continue to have, under appropriate safeguards and when necessary for law enforcement, the ability to identify people and hold them accountable for their conduct. In the case of encryption, the appropriate balance can be achieved by the widespread use of reliable, strong cryptography that allows for government access, with appropriate restrictions, in criminal investigations and for national security purposes. The federal escrowed encryption standard issued last year is designed to achieve this delicate balance for voice telephony."Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, argued that the  nature of the Internet, including its broad reach and the veil of anonymity, provides a fertile ground for hate-groups and other potentially dangerous organizations. While stressing the importance of the First Amendment, Hier recommended that:* Law enforcement should have the ability to monitor hate  groups and other organizations that clearly advocate an  intention to commit violence that use the Internet to  distribute information;* Online service providers (particularly the commercial  services such as AOL and Compuserve) should take steps to  prevent their networks from being used to distribute material  from these organizations;  and* To look at the uses of these communications technologies and  to examine what legal limits can be placed on it.William Burrington, Assistant General Counsel and Director of Government Affairs for America Online, stressed that AOL does take steps to address violations of its terms of service agreement, and has removed users who use the network to post inappropriate material to public forums.  However, Burrington cautioned that it is impossible and illegal under ECPA for a service provider to monitor every communication that travels across their network. Burrington further noted that, while it is possible for America Online to exercise limited control inside its own networks, monitoring and controlling content on the Internet is beyond the reach of any one because of the decentralized nature and global reach of the network.Speaking from direct experience, University of Wisconsin Law Professor Frank Tuerkheimer stressed that the government should not attempt too prevent or censor the publication of bomb-making manuals or other such materials -- not only because such action is clearly contrary to the First Amendment, but also because the material would inevitably be published in another forum, rendering the government's argument moot.This is precisely what occurred in 1979 in United States v. Progressive, Inc (476 F. Supp 990 (W.D. Wisc. 1979). In this case, the government, sought to prevent the publication of instructions on how to make a hydrogen bomb.  Professor Tuerkheimer was the federal prosecutor in the Progressive Case.  The article was ultimately published and the case became moot because the information was found to be available in a number of public libraries.Tuerkheimer noted that it would be futile for the government to attempt to prosecute someone for distributing bomb making material on the Internet, since information on how to build an ammonium nitrate bomb similar to the device used in the Oklahoma City tragedy can be found in encyclopedias and in publications available from the US Department of Agriculture.NEXT STEPS:Although the issue of the availability of bomb-making manuals and the use of the Internet by malitia and hate-groups has received considerable attention in the press and on Capitol hill in recent weeks, as of this writing there has been no legislation introduced, and so far none of the counter-terrorism proposals specifically address this issue.  CDT will closely track this issue, and will alert you to any developments as soon as they become available.Paths to Relevant Documents---------------------------CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman's testimony is available at the following URL's:<a href ="http://www.cdt.org/policy/terrorism/internet_bomb.test.html">http://www.cdt.org/policy/terrorism/internet_bomb.test.html</a><a href ="ftp://ftp.cdt.org/pub/cdt/policy/terrorism/internet_bomb.test">ftp://ftp.cdt.org/pub/cdt/policy/terrorism/internet_bomb.test</a>Additional hearing documents, including the Department of Justice testimony can be found at the following URL's <a href ="http://www.cdt.org/policy/terrorism/May11_hearing.html">http://www.cdt.org/policy/terrorism/May11_hearing.html</a><a href = "ftp://ftp.cdt.org/pub/cdt/policy/terrorism/00-INDEX.terrorism">ftp://ftp.cdt.org/pub/cdt/policy/terrorism/00-INDEX.terrorism</a>The Text of S. 714, Senator Leahy's Alternative to the Communications Decency Act, can be found at:<a href = "http://www.cdt.org/policy/legislation/s714.html">http://www.cdt.org/policy/legislation/s714.html</a><a href = "ftp://ftp.cdt.org/policy/legislation/s714.bill">ftp://ftp.cdt.org/policy/legislation/s714.bill</a>---------------------------------------------------------------(2) ABOUT THE CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY AND TECHNOLOGYThe Center for Democracy and Technology is a non-profit public interest organization.

(1) SENATOR LEAHY CALLS ON FBI TO JUSTIFY SURVEILLANCE CAPACITY REQUESTS

FBI Must Disclose Data to Ensure Public Accountability

US Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) on Friday November 3rd called on the FBI 
to disclose critical information justifying the its recent request for 
wiretapping capacity under the Communications Assistance for Law 
Enforcement Act (CALEA, a.k.a. the "Digital Telephony" law).  

CDT commends Senator Leahy for his leadership on this issue and his 
efforts to ensure a detailed public discussion of the necessity of the 
FBI's request. CDT believes that Congress should not appropriate any 
funds to cover the costs of capacity modifications until the FBI 
justifies its need for the proposed surveillance capacity. 

The FBI's proposal, published in the October 16 Federal Register, has 
sparked a great deal of concern from privacy advocates and the 
telecommunications industry that the FBI is seeking to expand its 
ability to wiretap digital telecommunications networks beyond its 
current activity the analog environment. In response to this concern, 
Senator Leahy sent the attached letter to FBI Director Freeh calling on 
the FBI to disclose two critical pieces of information used by the 
Bureau to determine its capacity needs: a survey of historical 
surveillance activity and an analysis of that activity.  The FBI's 
announcement of the proposed surveillance capacity did not contain this 
information.

Under CALEA, the FBI is required to publish requests for surveillance 
capacity in order to ensure public oversight and accountability over law 
enforcement surveillance activity.  In addition, CALEA requires that the 
government reimburse telecommunications carriers for any modifications 
made to meet the capacity requests. If the government fails to reimburse 
telecommunications carriers for capacity modifications, carriers are not 
required to make any changes to their networks.  Congress is currently 
considering legislation to appropriate funding for the proposal.

These provisions of CALEA were specifically designed to ensure a public 
debate over the necessity and costs of law enforcement surveillance 
capacity.  

CDT will continue to work closely with Senator Leahy, other members of 
Congress, and representatives from the public interest community and the 
telecommunications industry to ensure that the public accountability 
provisions of the law are followed, and that Congress carefully examines 
the basis of the FBI's request before approving funding for the 
proposal.

J. Edgar Hoover Building
9th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue
Washington, D.C.  20035

Dear Director Freeh:

Congress took the important step in the last Congress of passing the 
"Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act" (CALEA) to ensure 
that in cases of significant criminal activity, ranging from terrorism 
to kidnapping, law enforcement would continue to be able to execute 
court-authorized electronic surveillance.  Our Nation's law enforcement 
agencies are loosing their capability to use that important tool in the 
face of new and advanced telecommunications technologies.

Just as significantly, this new law also brings decisions affecting the 
privacy of our Nation's telephone system under statutory guidance and 
into the sunshine.  CALEA requires that law enforcement's demands 
regarding the number of wiretap orders that telephone companies must be 
able to service simultaneously, are published in the Federal Register 
and scrutinized in a public procedure.

The process set up in CALEA is working.  The Federal Bureau of 
Investigation recently published in the Federal Register a proposed 
notice of law enforcement's capacity demands predicated upon an 
historical baseline of electronic surveillance activity and an analysis 
of that activity.  The Federal Register notice did not include 
publication of those two documents.

Please provide me with copies of those two documents, which I also urge 
you to release to the public and publish in the Federal Register to 
ensure the fullest dissemination of the information.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[signature]
PATRICK J. LEAHY
United States Senator

(3) REVIEW OF DIGITAL TELEPHONY PROCESS TO DATE

FBI Must Address Critical Questions About The Proposed Capacity Notice

On October 16, 1995, the FBI published in the Federal Register its 
proposed notice of surveillance capacity, as required by CALEA.  The FBI 
has requested that telecommunications carriers, depending on the 
geographic area served by their network and the frequency of 
surveillance orders in those areas, reserve up to 1% of the capacity of 
each switch, feature, or service for law enforcement to conduct 
simultaneous electronic surveillance pursuant to proper legal 
authorization. 

CDT hopes that the publication of the basis of the FBI's surveillance 
capacity request will help to answer several critical questions about 
the proposal.  These include:

* ARE THE PROPOSED SURVEILLANCE CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS CONSISTENT WITH
  LAW ENFORCEMENT'S REAL NEEDS?

Is the FBI seeking to expand its surveillance capacity in digital 
telecommunications networks beyond its current activity in the analog 
environment?

The FBI has requested that, at a minimum, all telecommunications 
carriers nationwide ensure that .05% (.25% after 1998) of the 
"engineered capacity" of their networks be reserved for simultaneous 
surveillance activity, including wiretaps, trap and trace, and pen-
registers (devices used to capture dialed number information).  Greater 
capacity would be required in some areas (up to 1% by 1998 in the most 
populated parts of the US). 

Although there is some dispute about what is meant by the term 
"engineered capacity", the proposed notice appears to allow law 
enforcement the ability to conduct a great deal more surveillance 
activity than they currently undertake (estimated to be between 850 and 
1,000 per year nationwide).

* WHAT ARE THE REAL NUMBERS?

How much capacity is being asked for and how does it compare with 
today's surveillance levels?

The proposed surveillance capacity requirements are based on a 
percentage of the "engineered capacity" of the telecommunications 
network.  In the notice, the FBI defines "engineered capacity" as "the 
maximum number of subscribers that can be served by that equipment, 
facility, or service".  There is some dispute over the meaning of this 
term.

Taken on its face, the FBI's definition of "engineered capacity" appears 
to grant the FBI the capacity to conduct up to 1 wiretap for every 100 
telephone subscribers in densely populated areas.  The FBI disputes this 
number, and has stated that "engineered capacity" refers to the number 
of subscribers who can be serviced *simultaneously* by a particular 
facility, equipment, or service.  The FBI maintains that by this 
definition, the actual number of simultaneous wiretaps would be far 
lower than some have estimated.

Making public the basis of the FBI's surveillance capacity requests will 
help to clarify this issue.  However, regardless of the actual number, 
the FBI must demonstrate that it is not requesting unnecessary 
surveillance capacity.

* DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS WITH TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS FOR SURVEILLANCE 
  CAPACITY ABOVE THE NATIONAL MINIMUM?

The FBI has proposed to undertake direct negotiations with 
telecommunications carriers for surveillance capacity beyond the 
proposed national minimum standard requested in the notice.  

When Congress passed CALEA last year, it created a public process to 
bring law enforcement's electronic surveillance ability under public 
scrutiny in order to balance the new authority to influence the design 
of telecommunications networks.  

The public accountability provisions of CALEA require the FBI to publish 
*all* surveillance capacity requests.  Congress must take a critical 
look at this aspect of the FBI's proposal, and should not appropriate 
funds until the FBI agrees to disclose all capacity requests, as 
required by the law.

NEXT STEPS 

Public Accountability Requirements Of The Statute Must Be Met

CDT will work closely with Senator Leahy and others to ensure that the 
FBI discloses the basis for its recent surveillance capacity request.  
Once the information is made available, we will work with Senator Leahy, 
other interested members of Congress, public interest groups and the 
telecommunications industry to ensure that the FBI does not receive 
unnecessary surveillance capacity.  We will also work to ensure that no 
funding is made available until the public accountability provisions of 
the law are satisfied.

HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE APPROVE NATIONAL ID SYSTEM AS PROVISION OF 
IMMIGRATION BILL -- PROVISION IS WATERED DOWN, FIGHT MOVES TO HOUSE FLOOR

On September 20, 1995 members of the U.S. House of Representatives agreed 
to create a National Identification system. By a margin of 2 votes, the 
House Judiciary Committee failed to remove a provision of the House 
Immigration bill establishing a national registry of Social Security 
Administration and Immigration and Naturalization Service data. The 
Committee instead agreed to limit the scope of the system and to require 
Congressional authorization before large scale implementation. Excerpts 
from the Committee debate and the vote breakdown are printed below.

The effort to remove the national identification system provision is being 
led by Representative Steve Chabot (R-OH). Chabot offered an amendment to 
strike Section IV of HR. 2202, the "Immigration in the National Interest 
Act" (sponsored by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-TX) which would establish a national 
computer registry by combining Social Security Administration and 
Immigration and Naturalization Service data. 

The 'Employment Eligibility Mechanism' as the provision is called in the 
legislation, would be used to monitor and track all hiring decisions made 
by employers nationwide. As a result, the ability of every American to work 
would be conditioned on the accuracy of the information in this national 
data system.

Chabot's effort to remove the Employment Eligibility Mechanism was narrowly 
defeated 15 - 17. The committee instead approved an amendment offered by 
Rep. Martin Hoke (R-OH) to limit the scope of the program and require 
additional congressional authorization before a nation-wide system could 
be created. Debate now moves to the floor of the House, where another 
attempt to remove the provision altogether is likely. 

The 'Employment Eligibility Mechanism' has been vigorously opposed by a 
large and diverse coalition, including organization such as the ACLU, 
Citizens for a Sound Economy, the Center for Democracy and Technology, 
and individuals such as William Kristol (Project for the Republican Future), 
Jeff Eisenach (Progress and Freedom Foundation), and Jack Kemp 
(Empower America), among others (for more information, see CDT Policy 
Post No.15 URL:http://www.cdt.org/publications/pp150531.html).

Representative Chabot's amendment to remove the Employment Eligibility 
Mechanism provision had broad bi-partisan support and the support of civil 
liberties advocates, ethnic organizations, business leaders, and labor and 
religious organizations. Chabot, who referred to the Employment Eligibility 
Mechanism as "1-800-BIG-BROTHER, deserves credit for bringing this issue to 
the forefront of the debate. Chabot has indicated that he will continue to 
press for the removal of the provision as the bill moves to the House Floor.

Although the Committee did not remove the Employment Eligibility Mechanism 
provision, Rep. Hoke (R-OH) offered an amendment to limit the Employment 
Eligibility Mechanism to a pilot program which would be conducted in at 
least 5 of the 7 states with the largest number of unauthorized workers.   
Under the Hoke amendment, the pilot projects sunset on October 1, 1991, and 
the system may not be established in non pilot states without additional 
action by Congress.  In addition, Rep. Becerra (D-CA) added language 
directing the Attorney General to include an analysis of the system's: 
1) ease and reliability; 2) impact on job loss due to inaccurate or 
unavailable data; 3) effect on discrimination; 4) impact on privacy; 
and , 5) cost and administration to employers.  Both the Becerra and Hoke 
amendments were approved by a voice vote.

CDT is pleased that the Committee moved to limit the scope of the Employment 
Eligibility Mechanism and that Congressional approval would be required to 
expand the program. However, CDT remains vigorously opposed to government 
efforts to establish large scale national computer registries to track and 
verify personal information about US Citizens. Such proposals clearly violate 
the privacy rights of Americans, and create the potential for large scale 
surveillance by law enforcement agencies and discrimination by employers. 
CDT will closely monitor the progress of this issue and will update you on 
its progress as the House moves forward.

(3) Excerpts from Rep. Chabot's (R-OH) statement in favor of his amendment:

The system has been referred to as dialing 1-800-BIG-BROTHER.  It will be 
costly to operate; it won't work; and it will send exactly the wrong message 
as to whether the government is to be the master or the servant of the people.  
Our focus should be on illegal immigrants and the people who smuggle them in, 
not on innocent, law abiding American citizens.

Now, some people argue that we should oppose this system because it will lead 
inevitably to a national ID card. . . But I believe that this system is 
tremendously misguided even if one does not believe that it will evolve 
into a national ID.  We should stop this habit of turning to the private 
sector and forcing small business to act more and more as an arm of the 
federal government.  And we should get the federal government out of the 
face of innocent citizens.

Would this 1-800 number system even work?  I suppose that depends in part on 
your assumptions about whether those bad employers who now rely on undocumented 
labor would even call the number in the first place.  And it depends, of course, 
on your assumptions about the infallibility of government data and government 
employees.  Is everyone's name in the system now?  No.  Would every keystroke 
entered into the computer be perfectly executed?  Perhaps, but an error rate of 
only one percent would at the very least cause great heartache for about 650,000 
Americans each year.  And while we may believe that government is perfect 
(I confess I don't), would the employer always record the correct verification 
number? Personally, I worry about getting those verification numbers wrong every 
time I order some ticket by telephone. 

                              *    *     *

Would government be able to resist the temptation gradually to expand the 
uses of this new system once the set-up costs have been incurred?  Will we 
use it to track people, or to store more and more information on them?  The 
answer again depends on your view of government, informed perhaps by your 
view as to whether use of the social security numbers has up to now been 
limited to their initial function.

But let's just consider the system at hand.  I just don't think I was sent 
here to establish this sort of bureaucracy.  And I'm not surprised that the 
spectrum of people opposing these provisions is extremely broad and 
encompasses folks who are all over the lot on other immigration issues. 

My amendment will strengthen the bill, Mr. Chairman, for I do not believe 
that this legislation will be able to carry the weight of 1-800-BIG-BROTHER 
when it comes to the floor.  I urge adoption of the amendment.

Commercial Key Escrow Systems

<p>
<h3>I. Introduction</h3>
<p>
My name is Daniel Weitzner, Deputy Director of the Center for Democracy and Technology.  The Center is pleased to have opportunity to provide comments on the Administrations proposed private key escrow policies.  The Center for Democracy and Technology is an independent, non-profit public interest policy organization in Washington, DC. The Center's mission is to develop and implement public policies to protect and advance individual liberty and democratic values in new digital communications media. The Center achieves its goals through policy development, public education, and coalition building.  CDT also coordinates the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG), an ad hoc coalition of more than 50 computer, communications, and public interest organizations and associations working on communications privacy issues.  In the past, members of the Working Group have strongly opposed the Administration's Clipper Chip and worked on the Digital Telephony bill now passed into law. 
<p>
CDT is pleased that the Administration has made the commitment to develop a comprehensive communications security policy.  The original announcement to base such a policy on the private key escrow principles espoused in the Vice President' letter of July 1994 had great promise.  As we will illustrate below, however, the policy announced in September 1995 falls far short of the goals outlined by the Vice President and the needs of individual users and the industry.  Indeed, without substantial modification, the policy offers little to users, the market, or privacy advocates.  However, we remain committed to working with the Administration and the Congress to develop a comprehensive and balanced encryption policy that will meet user privacy needs and the legitimate interests of law enforcement agencies.  We continue to believe that the Gore letter contained the road map for such a policy and hope that the current efforts can be redirected along those lines.
<p>
<h3>II.	The Promise of the Gore Letter:  Potential for policy breakthrough to meet the needs users, industry, and law enforcement</h3>
<p>
With the explosive growth of the Internet and other interactive media, United States encryption policy has gone from a relatively unnoticed backwater of national security policy, to a highly visible and highly contentious area of technology policy of great concern to many industry groups and privacy advocates alike.  In this transition, there have been some missteps, including the Clipper Chip initiative.  After an unsuccessful effort to build support for the Clipper Chip in the market and the policy arena, the Clinton Administration announced its intention to develop a new encryption policy that would strike a more reasonable balance between the needs of users, the demands of the computer and communications marketplace, and the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  
<p>
The move away from reliance on the Clipper Chip marked an important turning point in the development of encryption policy.  First announced in a letter from Vice President Al Gore to Congresswoman Maria Cantwell on July 20, 1994, the Administration made a commitment to develop a policy framework that would promote the development of encryption systems that would meet the following criteria:
<p><ol>
<li><b>Implementation in hardware or software:</b>  After the hardware-only Clipper solution, the Administration recognized that any system must, according to the Gore letter, be "implementable in software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof."
<p>
<li><b>Public, unclassified algorithms:</b>  In order to assure users that their communications are truly secure, systems must employ encryption algorithms that are public, and thus subject to scrutiny by the broadest possible technical community.  Thus, the Vice President promised that the new policy "would not rely upon a classified algorithm."
<p>
<li><b>Voluntary:</b>  Although the Clipper Chip was always described as a voluntary technology, considerable fears arose that its use might one day become mandatory.  The Gore letter asserted that any new policy must be based on purely voluntary standards.
<p>
<li><b>Fourth Amendment privacy safeguards:</b>  Electronic surveillance constitutes an invasion of the most private realms of individual activity.  In order to protect individuals from unnecessary or excessive invasions by law enforcement agencies, Congress and the courts have instituted careful safeguards in the realm of traditional electronic surveillance through the telephone.  The Vice President's letter called for the extension of these protections in the form of "safeguards to provide for key disclosure only under legal authorization and should have audit procedures to ensure the integrity of the system."
<p>
<li><b>Statutory liability rules to protect users:</b>  In order to encourage users to trust private escrow systems, "escrow holders should be strictly liable for releasing keys without legal authorization," according to the Gore letter.
<p>
<li><b>Multiple escrow agents:</b>  Users must be free to chose their own escrow agents, unlike the Clipper proposal, so the Vice President declared that "a new key escrow encryption system must permit the use of private-sector key escrow agents as one option.... Having a number of escrow agents would give individuals and businesses more choices and flexibility in meeting their needs for secure communications."
</ul><p>

<h3>III.	Current Administration Proposal Fails to Meet High Standards Set out by the Vice President</h3>
<p>
The policy announced by the Administration in its September 1, 1995 paper, unfortunately fails to meet many of the criteria that the Vice President himself announced just one year ago in the above mentioned letter.  On hearing that the Administration had set out to develop a new encryption policy based on the principles outlined in the Gore letter, the Center for Democracy and Technology was guardedly optimistic that a genuine policy breakthrough was possible.  However, having had the opportunity to review the current proposal, every principle, except the first (software implementation) and second (public algorithms), thoughtfully outlined in the July 1994 letter is violated or, in one case, left in doubt, by the September 1995 policy statement.
<p>
The September 1995 policy statement diverges from the July 1994 letter in the following critical respects.  In our view, these divergences represent fundamental defects in the proposed policy and must be corrected.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Not Voluntary:</b>  The current proposal effectively compels all domestic users to use key escrow systems if they ever intend to communicate internationally.  Point 6 of the export criteria requires that an exportable system must not interoperate with any system that non-escrow systems.  Thus, in order for a user in the United States to communicate with anyone who uses a United States-made system on the Internet but outside of the United States, the American user must employ a key escrow system.  Domestic users are not legally compelled to use key escrow products, but the proposed policy forces, in practice, all but the most insular Internet user is propelled toward a key escrow system.  A policy based on such compulsion can hardly be called voluntary.
<p>
<li><b>Inadequate Security: </b> Point 1 precludes export of systems with key lengths beyond 64 bits.  Though this key size is larger than what is currently exportable, it is a level of security already judged inadequate for some applications.  Given the rate at which computing power increases, even a 64 bit key would be subject to attach before long.  
<p>
The premise of the key escrow policy is to provide law enforcement and national security agencies a "front door" to be used to decrypt messages when the agency obtains proper legal authorization.  Yet, the architects of the current policy apparently are not willing to trust that key escrow systems will meet law enforcement needs inasmuch as the key length limit suggests that the Administration is intent on maintaining an extra-legal method of decrypting communications.  The Gore letter contains no suggestion that key escrow systems would also be subject to key length limits but the Administration seems to have lost faith in its own proposal.  Such a half-hearted effort cannot be the basis of a long-lasting policy.
<p>
<li><b>No privacy protection for users of escrowed systems:</b>  The ten export principles make no mention of privacy safeguards which the Vice President previously recognized as necessary to safeguard individual privacy and Fourth Amendment principles.  Any escrow policy must contain safeguards against abuse and statutory liability provisions for the operators of private escrow systems.
<p>
<li><b>Fails to Promote International Interoperability:</b>  Points 6 and 10 of the export criteria raise grave doubts as to the likelihood that the current proposal will give rise to a secure global communications environment.  Point 10 forces users in other countries (and their governments) to accept United States-based escrow of all keys until bilateral access agreements are entered into.  Such tactics seem unlikely to produce satisfactory international agreements, and hold global communications security hostage to the completion of such agreements.
</ul><P>

<h3>IV.	Recommendations to Restore Current Process to Principles of Gore Letter</h3>
<p>
The Administration's September 1 paper leaves many privacy concerns unanswered or simply rejected, and falls far short of the goals set in the Gore letter of July 1994.  However, CDT still believes that the Administration has embarked on a serious process which, along with appropriate Congressional involvement, can lead to a long-lasting resolution to the encryption policy morass that exists today.  CDT recommends the following steps be taken immediately to supplement the September 1 policy framework.
<p><ul>
<h3>A.	Legislation to protect user privacy, address legitimate law enforcement needs, and guarantee voluntariness</h3></ul>
<p>
Encryption is now a key enabling technology in the development of the National and Global Information Infrastructure.  The growth of electronic commerce, the protection of intellectual property, and the very viability of cyberspace as an economic, social, cultural and political arena depend on the widespread availability of strong encryption.  As such, encryption policy can no longer be made in the closed halls Executive Branch national security policy.  
<p>
Like the Clipper Chip before it, the proposed key escrow policy framework places the National Security Agency in control of private sector computer security policy.  Such a role for the NSA is both detrimental to the growth of the information infrastructure and contrary to the principles of the Computer Security Act of 1987.  The Computer Security Act clearly established that neither military nor law enforcement agencies are the proper protectors of personal privacy.  When considering the law, Congress asked, "whether it is proper for a super-secret agency [the NSA] that operates without public scrutiny to involve itself in domestic activities...?"  The answer was a clear "no."
<p>
As important as the principle of civilian control was in 1987, it is even more critical today.  The more individuals around the country come to depend on secure communications to protect their privacy, the more important it is to conduct privacy and security policy dialogues in public, civilian forums.
<p>
If encryption policy is to be based on private key escrow as proposed by the Administration, legislative action is required to assure:
<p><ol>
<li><b>Complete voluntariness: </b> No government action should compel individuals or corporations to use key escrow systems;
<p>
<li><b>User choice of among multiple private escrow agents:</b>  Any entity that meets statutory criteria should be allowed to be an escrow agent.  Free market mechanisms should be allowed to meet the varying needs of users;
<p>
<li><b>User choice of encryption algorithm: </b>Different users with different applications will need varying degrees of security and should be allowed to chose the level and type of encryption appropriate to their needs.  Individual choice and market innovation, not government fiat, should guide choice of encryption algorithm;
<p>
<li><b>Statutory framework for law enforcement access and agent liability for improper disclosure:</b>  Under law, a private escrow agent could only legally disclose a users to those who are approved by the user, or to an authorized law enforcement agency, upon presentation of a 4th Amendment warrant. Private escrow agents (PEAs) would operate under a statutory framework which requires a PEA to hold private keys for users under a special standard of care and creates remedies in the event of unauthorized disclosure.  
<p>
In providing assistance to enable law enforcement to decrypt communications, the PEA may not disclose the target's private key to law enforcement.  However, as stated in the ten criteria and as much as is technically feasible, law enforcement should be assured speedy, uninterrupted access to decrypted communications once the surveillance is judicially approved.
<p>
<li><b>Audit trails for law enforcement access: </b>PEA's would be legally required to configure their systems in such a way to create a trusted and complete audit trail of all key access events.  This audit function would provide key holders with the ability to seek damages from the PEA if necessary and could act as a check on law enforcement activity. 
</ol><p>
<h3>B.	Export Control Reform</h3>
<ol><p>
<li><b>Full Export Authorization:</b>  Private key escrow systems that meet these principles should be fully exportable, under Commerce Department jurisdiction.
<p>
<li><b>End key-size limitations: </b> All properly escrowed encryption systems must be eligible for export, regardless of key size.  Since escrow systems would give law enforcement and national security agencies access to all communications, there can no longer be any justification for limiting key size.
<p></ol></ul>

<h3>V.	Conclusion</h3>
<p>
As measured by the demands of privacy and security, and by the standards set out in the 1994 Gore letter, the current key escrow policy proposals fall short of the mark.  However, CDT remains committed to working within the process set out by the Administration, and with the Congress, toward a speedy resolution of all of these critical encryption policy issues.

<p>
<h3>I. 	Introduction</h3>
<p>
Good afternoon, my name is Daniel Weitzner, Deputy Director of the Center for  Democracy and Technology ("CDT"). The Center is pleased to have this opportunity to  comment on the Administration's proposed private key escrow export criteria. CDT is  an independent, non-profit public interest policy organization in Washington, D.C. The Center's mission is to develop and implement public policies to protect and advance  individual liberty and democratic values in new digital communications media. The  Center achieves its goals through policy development, public education, and coalition  building. CDT also coordinates the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group  (DPSWG), an ad hoc coalition of more than 50 computer, communications, and public interest organizations and associations working on communications privacy issues. In the past, members of the Working Group have strongly opposed the Administration's Clipper Chip proposal and have worked on the Digital Telephony bill passed into law last fall.
<p>
CDT is pleased to be here again as part of the Administration's continuing 
efforts to engage industry and the public in a discussion of U.S. cryptography policy.   We are particularly concerned that the voice of Internet users be heard in this forum.  Unfortunately, today we must once again deliver the same message that civil liberties organizations, industry groups, and the cryptography user community have been repeating with increasing urgency over the last several years: this is the wrong approach to cryptography policy.  A cryptography policy based upon a narrow national security perspective that ignores the security needs of individual users is unlikely to form the sound basis for a secure worldwide communications infrastructure.  A cryptography policy without explicit privacy protections will never gain the trust of users 
or be embraced by the international marketplace.
<p>
	CDT believes that the Administration's proposal fails to meet the needs of the  user community.   Our chief concern is that the Global Information Infrastructure (GII) be a safe and secure place for those who use it. The Administration's proposal will not give users the security and privacy they need, and will keep the market from giving it to them as well. The NIST proposal will not provide adequate security, promote secure communications worldwide, or guarantee user privacy: 
<p>
<ul><li><b>Inadequate security in the near-term -- </b>Does not provide any short-term  liberalization of the insecure 40-bit key length limits on exports.<p>
<li><b>No viable policy framework for the long-term -- </b>Limits exportable key escrow systems to 64-bit keys lengths that many anticipate will soon be vulnerable;  has little to offer in a market where 56-bit non-escrow products are readily available.<p>
<li><b>Hinders the deployment of globally interoperable secure systems --</b> Delays the development of standards for secure communications due to its strict interoperability requirements.<p>
<li><b>Not necessarily voluntary  -- </b>In practice, could act to coerce both the domestic and international markets for cryptography.<p>
<li><b>Not viable in the marketplace -- </b>Given that overseas users are unlikely to adopt its restrictions when strong, non-escrowed foreign cryptography products are readily available.<p>
<li><b>No constitutional privacy protections --</b> Provides no standards for the release of escrowed keys, for certifying key agents, or for liability for the improper release of keys.<p>
<li><b>Will not meet the needs of law enforcement --</b> Will not deny criminals or terrorists access to strong encryption, the stated objective of the policy.
</ul><p>
The firestorm of protest that greeted the introduction of the Clipper Chip 
proposal suggests the pitfalls of a policy approach driven largely by national security and law enforcement concerns. The latest NIST criteria continue to make policy within this narrow framework. The failure of this approach suggests that a broader view is appropriate. Forty participants in CDT's Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG) have written to Vice President Gore protesting this latest cryptography initiative and committing to a six month collective policy development process, aimed at framing a more comprehensive cryptography policy that better recognizes the 
realities of the global marketplace and the privacy concerns of users. We look forward to working with the Administration in this process over the coming months.
<p>
<p>
<h3>II.	Users Urgently Need Security, Privacy, and a More Comprehensive Approach to Cryptography Policy</h3>
<p>
A secure, private, and trusted Global Information Infrastructure (GII) is essential to promote economic growth and meet the needs of Information Age society.  Developing that secure and trusted GII will require strong, flexible, widely-available cryptography. Individuals need to have confidence in the GII if they are to realize its full democratic potential for promoting free association and personal communications. 
<p>
Competitive businesses need to protect proprietary information as it flows across insecure global communications networks. To realize that democratic potential, individual users need the privacy protections that cryptography offers; to protect their proprietary communications, business users need the security only strong encryption can provide.
<p>
In recent months, however, the public has been made increasingly aware of the dangers of computer crime and the vulnerability of current cryptography 
implementations. Rapid advances in the speed and sophistication of hardware and software have already laid siege to the 40-bit key systems currently approved for export, as well as the popular 56-bit DES algorithm. If we are to maintain the trust of the public and realize the full potential of the GII, a more comprehensive long-term approach to cryptography is needed -- one which particularly reflects the impact of technological change, of a global economy,  and of the increasingly important information infrastructure.
<p>
The GII will simply not continue to develop without such a global approach to cryptography. The lack of any international standard for strong cryptography has already hindered the deployment of highly secure systems worldwide. Moreover, national and regional governments are increasingly considering regulations on the use of cryptography, just as the Council of Europe recently did.  Such actions threaten to create a patchwork of international regulations which would hinder the deployment 
of secure global communications and leave users without the security and privacy they need.
<p>
In this context, the sole focus on national security needs embodied in the 
Administration's cryptography proposal is unlikely to meet the needs of GII users.  By maintaining the 40-bit key length restrictions on exports, it leaves users hamstrung with insecure systems. By proposing unattractive interoperability restrictions and minimal privacy protections for key escrow systems, it discourages the deployment of secure systems in U.S. products. Rather than being seamlessly incorporated into popular products, secure communications will remain out of reach for less sophisticated GII users. The resulting loss of security can be expected to have a chilling effect on the development of electronic commerce and the information infrastructure as the privacy and security needs of users are not met.
<p>
<p>
<h3>III.	The NIST Criteria Have Been Widely Criticized by Industry, Public  Interest Groups, and the User Community For Not Meeting GII 
Security and Privacy Demands</h3>
<p>
The vast majority of individuals and organizations who have expressed an 
opinion on the recent Administration initiative have been overwhelmingly dissatisfied with the proposal.  The NIST criteria have met with increasing criticism concerning security, privacy, technical feasibility, and marketplace viability.  In a series of letters this fall, individual companies, trade associations, and citizens groups, from an array of industries and across the political spectrum, have expressed their concern that the Administration's proposal will not meet the needs of GII users.  Some of the public 
interest groups critical of the NIST criteria include --  
<p><ul>
<li>Conservative and taxpayer reform groups, including Americans for Tax Reform and officials from the Cato Institute, the Institute for Justice, the NRA, and Reason magazine -- "The Administration's approach is the wrong policy for  today's marketplace. . . . It's anti-consumer", "anti-marketplace", "anti-American business", and "anti-progress." (Ad Hoc Taxpayer Coalition for Computer Privacy Letter to House Speaker Gingrich, Nov. 8, 1995)
<p>
<li>American Civil Liberties Union -- "The Administration should abandon its fruitless and unconstitutional efforts to control the export of encryption 
technology." (ACLU's Position on the Administration's Current Key Escrow 
Proposal, Oct. 4, 1995 Cyber_Liberties Alert)
<p>
<li>The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Electronic Privacy Information Center, and Voters Telecommunications Watch -- All have issued online statements critical of the NIST criteria.
</ul>
<p>
The NIST criteria have also been criticized by industry trade associations 
representing  dozens of companies directly involved in providing the goods and services that form the basis for the GII.  Some of the organizations expressing their concern that the criteria will not allow them to meet the needs of GII users include-- 
<P>
<ul>
<li><b>Business Software Alliance --</b> "After careful and serious deliberation by our members, we have concluded that the Administration's approach is fatally flawed and cannot be the basis for progress in this area." (BSA Letter to Vice President Gore, Nov. 9, 1995)
<p>
<li><b>Software Publisher's Association -- </b>"There are severe and fundamental flaws in the criteria proposed for exportable key escrow systems." (SPA Letter to Vice President Gore, Sept. 26, 1995)
<p>
<li><b>Information Technology Industry Council --</b> "ITI believes the proposal does not adequately meet the needs of industry or users, not does it sufficiently recognize the importance of information security to economic growth and industrial society in the information age." (ITI Letter to Vice President Gore, Oct. 10, 1995)
<p>
<li><b>The Information Technology Association of America  --</b> "[I]ts restrictive policies on the export of encryption technology has created a major barrier to realizing the Administration's vision. . . [T]he Administration's key escrow encryption proposal .announced on August 17, 1995 has some fundamental flaws." (ITAA Letter to Vice President Gore, Sept. 27, 1995)
</ul>
<p>
Finally, a broad group containing forty members of the Digital Privacy and 
Security Working Group (DPSWG), including companies, trade associations, and public interest groups, together wrote to the Vice President:
</ul><p>
<li><b>Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG) --</b> "[T]he proposed initiative is no substitute for a comprehensive national cryptography policy.  To the extent that the current policy becomes a substitute for a more comprehensive policy, the initiative actually risks hindering the development of a secure and trusted GII." (DPSWG Letter to Vice President Gore, Nov. 8, 1995) 
</ul>
<p>
This letter was signed by individual companies from across several industry 
groups, and included America Online, Apple Computer, AT&T, Dun & 
Bradstreet, MCI, Microsoft, Oracle, Sybase, and Tandem, along with public 
interest groups such as CDT, EFF, and the Media Institute. These DPSWG 
members also pledged to commence "a process of collective fact-finding and 
policy deliberation, aimed at building consensus around a more comprehensive cryptography framework." A copy of the DPSWG Letter to Vice President Gore is attached as an Appendix to this testimony.
<p>
<p>
<h3>IV.	The NIST Proposal Will Not Meet the Cryptography Needs of Users,  Such as Adequate Security, Privacy, International Acceptance or 
Voluntary Use</h3>
<p>
The 40 DPSWG participant companies, trade associations, and public interest 
groups who together wrote to Vice President Gore in November also presented a set of goals for a more comprehensive cryptography policy.  These goals included:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Robust security:</b>  access to levels of encryption sufficient to address domestic and international security threats, especially as advances in computing power make currently deployed cryptography systems less secure.
<p>
<li><b>International interoperability:  </b>the ability to securely interact worldwide.
<p>
<li><b>Voluntary use: </b>freedom for users to choose encryption solutions, developed in the marketplace, that meet their particular needs.
<p>
<li><b>Acceptance by the marketplace: </b>commercial viability and ability to meet the expressed needs of cryptography users.
<P>
<li><b>Constitutional privacy protections:</b> safeguards to ensure basic Fourth Amendment privacy protection and regulation of searches, seizures, and interceptions.
<p>
<li><b>Respect for the legitimate needs of law enforcement and national security, </b>while recognizing the reality that determined criminals will have access to virtually unbreakable encryption.
</ul>
<p>
Many of these organizations and companies have argued individually that various aspects of the NIST criteria do not meet these goals.  Taken together, these arguments provide a compelling critique of the Administration's cryptography policy:
<p>
<b>A.	The NIST criteria will not provide adequate security.</b>
<p>
Widely-accessible strong cryptography is the cornerstone of a secure and 
trusted GII, and is essential to promote electronic commerce and communication.  The provisions of the Administration's proposal that impose a 64-bit key length limit for key escrow systems, and retain 40-bit key length limits for non-escrowed systems, present a real challenge to user needs for adequate security both in the short- and long-term.
<p>
<ul><b>The NIST proposal provides no immediate liberalization of the insecure 40-bit key length limit</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The 40-bit key lengths widely available and exportable today have proven 
increasingly insecure. Stories in the popular press continue to point out 
network and application vulnerabilities.  As a result users remain distrustful, 
hindering the development of the nascent but important economic promise 
of the GII. Moreover, domestic hardware, software, and communications 
companies remain hamstrung by the export criteria in the face of competing 
foreign products that already contain the sorts of security valued in the 
marketplace.  
<p>
<li>Even if the NIST criteria were to be adopted, it will take some time before the details of key escrow systems can be worked out -- including the technical 
development of systems meeting the NIST criteria, the standards for and 
certification of escrow agents, the adoption of privacy guidelines, and the 
integration of such systems into widely-used software products. Individuals 
and industry need immediate relief to allow for a much-needed upgrade of 
security on the GII and the development of competitive products that meet 
security needs today. As the SPA recently stated, "The key escrow policy 
process will necessarily be protracted. Meanwhile, there remains -- more 
strongly than it did in 1992 -- an immediate commercial need for the 
exportability of non-escrow encryption that can complete in the global 
marketplace. . . ." (SPA Letter to Vice President Gore, Sept. 26, 1995)
</ul>
<b>64-bit key escrow is not a secure long-term policy. </b>
<p><ul>
<li>The popular 56-bit DES algorithm has proven increasingly susceptible to 
brute-force attack. Advances in computational power have led experts to 
question the security of 64-bit keys beyond the near term.  As the ITAA 
noted,  "[E]nd-users' confidence in 56-bit encryption is weakening and even 
DES may soon be obsolete. . . . Even [decontrol of 64-bit encryption] will 
have to be addressed again in the not too distant future given the march of 
technology and rapid increases in computing power." (ITAA Letter to Vice 
President Gore, Sept. 27, 1995)
 <p>
<li>Users are unlikely to choose 64-bit key escrow systems when non-escrow 
56-bit DES and stronger foreign products are readily available. As SPA 
noted in it's letter to the Vice President, "[K]ey escrow systems will simply not 
be marketable in a world in which non-escrow encryption is widely available 
at strengths stronger than 40 bits." (SPA Letter to Vice President Gore, Sept. 
26, 1995)
</ul></ul>
<p>
<b>B.  The NIST criteria will hinder international interoperability and the 
development of an international cryptography standard.</b>
<p>
Under the NIST criteria, exportable key escrow systems would not be 
permitted to interoperate with strong systems that do not meet the criteria. These restrictions impede international interoperability in several ways. The 
interoperability restrictions would immediately create a barrier between those 
who obey the criteria and those who use some other form of strong encryption.  In addition, the continuation of a U.S. export control policy similarly creates a two-tier market with a barrier between products available in the U.S. and products available outside of it. Finally, it is unlikely that foreign users will embrace the NIST criteria as a standard when there is conveniently available non-escrow encryption of similar or greater strength available. All of these, taken together, will serve to hinder the development of global standards for the use of cryptography.
<p>
<b>C.	The NIST criteria act to use export controls to coerce the domestic cryptography markets.</b>
 <p>
Interoperability restrictions and other criteria may function as an attempt 
to use export restrictions to influence the domestic market in an effort to solve domestic law enforcement problems. Domestic users will be forced to meet the export criteria if they wish to communicate with systems outside of the U.S. that also meet the criteria. If, for example, a domestic corporation using Eudora mail software with strong encryption wanted to communicate with a foreign affiliate using the same U.S.-made software, both versions of the software would have to meet the NIST export criteria.
<p>
Furthermore, the desire of companies to sell product lines that 
interoperate with each other, taken together with NIST's interoperability 
restrictions and export limits, could work to force the adoption of a cryptography standard based on the NIST criteria. As BSA noted in its letter to the Vice President, "The Administration appears to be trying to leverage our companies' desire to export their programs in order to force those companies to include features in the programs they sell abroad and in the U.S. . . .  Thus, in the name of 'national security,' it appears that the Administration really is attempting to satisfy domestic law enforcement concerns -- without industry input, public debate, or congressional involvement." (BSA Letter to Vice President Gore, Nov. 9, 1995)
<p>
<b>D.  Products meeting the NIST criteria will not be viable in the 
international marketplace.</b>
 <p>
The NIST criteria fail to recognize that equally secure, non-escrowed 
foreign encryption products are readily available overseas.  Foreign products 
are already adopting 56-bit or better encryption, without having to meet the 
NIST requirements.  (For example, Trusted Information Systems, Inc. has 
documented the availability of 179 foreign products incorporating the popular 
56-bit DES.) 
<p> 
Moreover, international users are much more likely to adopt products 
without the NIST criteria. Requirements such as NIST-imposed interoperability restrictions, or key escrow criteria that provide no due process and privacy guarantees, will make U.S. products less attractive than foreign products with similar or better security.
<p>
<b>E. 	The NIST criteria do not include any constitutional privacy 
protections.</b>
 <p>
The export criteria contain no explicit provisions for constitutional  
privacy safeguards to govern the use of key escrow systems. The criteria do 
not offer any guidelines for obtaining escrowed keys, nor are there any 
requirements for notifying users whose keys have been accessed. No 
standards are presented for how key escrow agents will be "certified by the 
government", or what redress will be available against escrow agents that 
improperly release keys. Moreover, the criteria provide no explanation of how the standards will be applied to foreign citizens, or by foreign countries that support individual privacy in ways that may be radically different from the protections guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution.
<p>
<b>F.	NIST criteria may not actually promote the needs of law 
enforcement.</b>
 <p>
Any system which expects to solve law enforcement problems must be 
attractive enough to users to be adopted widely.  Interoperability restrictions, 
weak security, and missing privacy protections make it less likely that users will adopt a U.S. key escrow system. As the ITAA also noted,  "[E]xport restrictions that do not reflect marketplace realities may drive U.S. companies to move their encryption work off shore . . . defeating the very purpose of the restrictions." (ITAA Letter to Vice President Gore, Sept. 27, 1995)
<p>
Moreover, the international nature of the Internet makes it virtually 
impossible to ever guarantee that determined individuals will not have access to strong cryptography. While criminals will always have privacy, the users with insecure networks will be individuals and organizations forced to adopt the NIST criteria.
<p>
<p>
<h3>IV. 	Conclusion: The Urgent Need for a More Comprehensive Approach</h3>
<P>
A comprehensive approach to cryptography policy -- one that provides real 
security, is truly voluntary, contains explicit privacy protections, and is acceptable to the international market  -- is greatly needed to smooth the emergence of a secure and trusted information infrastructure. Unfortunately, the Administration's proposal does not meet this need.  This most recent NIST proposal comes at a time of great urgency in the development of electronic commerce, digital communication, and the GII.  GII users 
are searching for tools to provide the privacy and security they need to realize the full democratic, and commercial, potential of the emerging information age society.  Last year, Vice President Gore's letter to Representative Maria Cantwell held out hope for the user community by laying out a set of guiding principles for a more comprehensive approach to national cryptography policy. Perhaps these goals can form the starting point for a renewed look at cryptography policy.  
<p>
In their November letter to Vice President Gore, members of the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group pledged to work together over the next six months to seek a consensus around just such a more comprehensive cryptography policy. CDT invites all who are interested to participate in this open process of collective fact-finding and policy debate over the next several months. We thank NIST for continuing this dialogue, and look forward to working with the Administration in the months ahead.

(1) FBI Surveillance Capacity Request Fails to Meet Public Accountability 
    Requirements of Digital Telephony Bill

The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) and the Center for National 
Security Studies (CNSS), in comments filed Tuesday (1/16), argued that the
implementation of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 
(CALEA, a.k.a the 'Digital Telephony legislation") cannot proceed because 
the FBI has not justified its proposal for surveillance capacity, as required 
by law. 

CALEA, enacted in October of 1994, granted the FBI an unprecedented new role in 
the design of telecommunications networks to accommodate electronic surveillance. 
In order to protect against abuse, and to ensure that privacy and security are 
not compromised, Congress balanced the FBI's new authority with a detailed public 
process to ensure oversight and accountability.  Thus, CALEA also created an 
unprecedented opportunity for those concerned about privacy to have their say 
over law enforcement's surveillance ability.

CDT and CNSS argued that no funds should be appropriated by Congress or spent 
to fund the implementation of the Digital Telephony law until the FBI meets 
these public accountability requirements.

PUBLIC OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF CALEA

The public accountability provisions of CALEA, which created a detailed public 
process for determining law enforcement surveillance capacity requirements, require 
the Bureau to disclose the factual basis for its recent capacity request. Without 
such data, it is impossible for the public and other interested parties to determine 
whether the proposed surveillance capacity is reasonable.

As Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), co-author of CALEA, emphasized during the August 
11, 1994 joint House/Senate Judiciary Committee hearing:

   "To allay public concern over the breadth of wiretapping in 
    America, the entire [compliance] process remains subject to 
    public scrutiny, oversight, and accountability. This bill 
    accomplishes this by requiring any standards or technical 
    requirements that industry adopts to ensure wiretap capability 
    be publicly available." (House/Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing 
    on CALEA, August 11, 1994, S. HRG. 103-1022, page 111)

As a result, CALEA contains several mechanisms to bring law enforcement's 
surveillance ability under public scrutiny, including the creation of a 
public process for determining law enforcement's surveillance requirements 
and a requirement that government reimburse telecommunications carriers for 
all modifications required to meet the requirements. 

These provisions were intended to allow privacy advocates and other concerned 
individuals to have a substantive voice in the compliance process.  The public
accountability provisions of CALEA are essential to ensuring that law enforcement 
and does not take actions that expand surveillance authority or jeopardize the 
privacy and security of telecommunications networks.  The comments filed by CDT, 
CNSS, EPIC, and industry associations such as the United States Telephone 
Association (USTA) and the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), 
and other interested parties, are the strongest example yet of the public 
accountability mechanisms in action. 

CDT & CNSS ARGUE FBI NOTICE FAILS TO COMPLY WITH PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY 
PROVISIONS OF CALEA

In joint comments filed January 16, CDT and CNSS told the FBI that its 
October 16, 1995 proposal does not contain critical information necessary for 
interested parties to assess the reasonableness of the FBI's request. Among 
other things:

* The notice does not disclose the historical baseline data that the FBI   
  itself used to determine the proposed surveillance capacity 
  requirements. Without this information, it is impossible for the 
  public to determine whether the proposed surveillance levels are 
  reasonable.

* Has not disclosed certain details that CALEA itself requires to be 
  published, including the actual number of expected future 
  surveillances and the geographic locations where such capacity will be 
  necessary;

* Has not clearly defined "engineered capacity", a key term. The scope 
  of surveillance capacity available to the FBI varies greatly depending 
  on the definition of this term;

Until the FBI meets these public accountability requirements, no funds should be 
appropriated by Congress or spent to fund the implementation of the Digital 
Telephony law.

CDT stands ready to intervene as necessary before Congress, the Federal 
Communications Commission, the telecommunications industry standards bodies 
charged with setting technical standards for implementing the requirements, 
and at other points necessary to ensure that privacy is protected and the 
public accountability provisions are strictly enforced.  We will continue to 
update you on developments on this issue as they occur.

<title>CDT Led Coalition Letter to VP Gore, November 8, 1995</title>
</head>
<body>
<br>
<br>
November 8, 1995
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Honorable Albert Gore, Jr.<br>
Office of the Vice President<br>
Old Executive Office Building, Room 276<br>
Washington, D.C. 20501<br>
<p>
Dear Mr. Vice President:
<p>
A secure, private, and trusted Global Information Infrastructure (GII) is essential to promote economic growth and meet the needs of the Information Age society.  Competitive businesses need cryptography to protect proprietary information as it flows across increasingly vulnerable global networks. Individuals require privacy protection in order to build the confidence necessary to use the GII for personal and financial transactions.  Promoting the development of the GII and meeting the needs of the Information Age will require strong, flexible, widely-available cryptography.  The undersigned groups recognize that the Administration's recently articulated cryptography initiative was a serious attempt to meet some of these challenges, but the proposed initiative is no substitute for a comprehensive national cryptography policy.  To the extent that the current policy becomes a substitute for a more comprehensive policy, the initiative actually risks hindering the development of a secure and trusted GII.
<p>
A number of the undersigned organizations have already written to express concern about the latest Administration cryptography initiative. As some of us have noted, the Administration's proposed export criteria will not allow users to choose the encryption systems that best suit their security requirements.  Government ceilings on key lengths will not provide an adequate level of security for many applications, particularly as advances in computing render current cryptography systems less secure.   Competitive international users are steadily adopting stronger foreign encryption in their products and will be unlikely to embrace U.S. restrictions.  As they stand, current export restrictions place U.S. hardware manufacturers, software developers, and computer users at a competitive disadvantage, seriously hinder international interoperability, and threaten the strategically important U.S. communications and computer hardware and software industries. Moreover, the Administration policy does not spell out any of the privacy safeguards essential to protect individual liberties and to build the necessary public trust in the GII. 
<p>
The current policy directive also does not address the need for immediate liberalization of current export restrictions. Such liberalization is vital to enable U.S. companies to export state-of-the-art software products during the potentially lengthy process of developing and adopting a comprehensive national cryptography policy. Without relief, industry and individuals alike are faced with an unworkable limit on the level of security available and remain hamstrung by restrictions that will not be viable in the domestic and international marketplace. 
<p>
Many members of the undersigned groups have been working actively with the Administration on a variety of particular applications, products, and programs promoting information security.  All of us are united, however, by the concern that the current network and information services environment is not as secure as it should be, and that the current policy direction will delay the secure, private, and trusted environment that is sought.
<p>
Despite the difficulties of balancing the competing interests involved, the undersigned companies, trade associations, and privacy organizations are commencing a process of collective fact-finding and policy deliberation, aimed at building consensus around a more comprehensive cryptography policy framework that meets the following criteria:  
<p><ul>
<li><b>Robust security:</b>  access to levels of encryption sufficient to address domestic and international security threats, especially as advances in computing power make currently deployed cryptography systems less secure.
<p>
<li><b>International interoperability:</b>  the ability to securely interact worldwide.
<p>
<li><b>Voluntary use:</b> freedom for users to choose encryption solutions, developed in the marketplace, that meet their particular needs.
<p>
<li><b>Acceptance by the marketplace: </b>commercial viability and ability to meet the expressed needs of cryptography users.
<p>
<li><b>Constitutional privacy protections: </b>safeguards to ensure basic Fourth Amendment privacy protection and regulation of searches, seizures, and interceptions.
<p>
<li><b>Respect for the legitimate needs of law enforcement</b> and national security, while recognizing the reality that determined criminals will have access to virtually unbreakable encryption.
</ul>
In six months, we plan to present our initial report to the Administration, the Congress, and the public in the hopes that it will form the basis for a more comprehensive, long-term approach to cryptography on the GII. We look forward to working with the Administration on this matter.

     OPEN LETTER TO THE INTERNET COMMUNITY
     
     May 2, 1996
     
     Dear friends:
     
     As an Internet user, you are no doubt aware of some of the hurdles the 
     federal government has put up that limit the growth and full potential 
     of exciting, emerging technologies.  One of the most egregious of 
     these has been the governmentally set limits on so-called "encryption" 
     technologies.  Today I am introducing a bill to address this major 
     problem for businesses and users of the Internet. 
     
     If the telecommunications law enacted this year is a vehicle to 
     achieve real changes in the ways we interact with each other 
     electronically, my bill is the engine that will allow this vehicle to 
     move forward.  The bill would promote the growth of electronic 
     commerce, encourage the widespread availability to strong privacy and 
     security technologies for the Internet, and repeal the out-dated 
     regulations prohibiting the export of encryption technologies.
     
     This legislation is desperately needed because the Clinton 
     administration continues to insist on restricting encryption exports, 
     without regard to the harm this policy has on American businesses' 
     ability to compete in the global marketplace or the ability of 
     American citizens to protect their privacy online.  Until we get the 
     federal government out of the way and encourage the development of 
     strong cryptography for the global market, electronic commerce and the 
     potential of the Internet will not be realized.
     
     The last thing the Net needs are repressive and outdated regulations 
     prohibiting the exports of strong privacy and security tools and 
     making sure that the government has copies of the keys to our private 
     communications.  Yet this is exactly the situation we have today.
     
     My new bill, the Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era 
     (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996, would:
     
     - Allow for the unrestricted export of "mass-market" or 
     "public-domain" encryption programs, including such products as Pretty 
     Good Privacy and popular World Wide Web browsers.
     
     - Require the Secretary of Commerce to allow the unrestricted export 
     of other encryption technologies if products of similar strength are 
     generally available outside the United States.
     
     - Prohibit the federal government from imposing mandatory key-escrow 
     encryption policies on the domestic market and limit the authority of 
     the Secretary of Commerce to set standards for encryption products.
     
     Removing export controls will dramatically increase the domestic 
     availability of strong, easy-to-use privacy and security products and 
     encourage the use of the Internet as a forum of secure electronic 
     commerce. It will also undermine the Clinton Administration's 
     "Clipper" proposals which have used export restrictions as leverage to 
     impose policies that guarantee government access to our encryption 
     keys.
     
     The Pro-CODE bill is similar to a bill I co-authored with Senator 
     Patrick Leahy of Vermont, except that it highlights the importance of 
     encryption to electronic commerce and the need to dramatically change 
     current policy to encourage its growth.  My bill does not add any new 
     criminal provisions and does not establish legal requirements for 
     key-escrow agents.
     
     Over the coming months, I plan to hold hearings on this bill and 
     encourage a public debate on the need to change the Clinton 
     Administration's restrictive export control policies.  I will need 
     your support as we move forward towards building a global Internet 
     that is good for electronic commerce and privacy.  I look forward to 
     working with the Internet community, online activists, and the 
     computer and communications industry as this proposal moves through 
     Congress.
     
     I'd like to hear from you, so please join me on two upcoming online 
     events to talk about the new bill.  The first is on America Online in 
     the News Room auditorium at 9 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on May 6.  
     The second will be on Hotwired's Chat at 9 p.m. EDT on May 13.
     
     In the meantime, I need your help in supporting the effort to repeal 
     cryptography export controls.  You can find out more by visiting my 
     web page http://www.senate.gov/~burns/.  There you will find a 
     collection of encryption education resources that my Webmaster has 
     assembled.  I trust that the entire Internet community, from the 
     old-timers to those just starting to learn about encryption, will find 
     this information useful.
     
     This bill is vital to all Americans, from everyday computer users and 
     businesses to manufacturers of computer software and hardware.  I very 
     much look forward to working with you on this issue.

(1) VICTORY FOR ZIMMERMANN, FUNDAMENTAL PRIVACY ISSUES REMAIN

After 3 years of investigation, the United States Department of Justice
Thursday (1/11) announced that it would not seek an indictment of Phil
Zimmermann, the author of the widely popular encryption program known as
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). While this development is obviously good news
for Zimmermann, who was the undeserved target of a long and arduous
investigation, criminal threates against those who seek to protect their
privacy remain in place.

The Justice Department had been investigating Zimmermann for possible
violations of Arms Control Regulations of after PGP was posted to Usenet
newsgroups and subsequently distributed through the worldwide Internet in
the spring of 1991.

CDT wishes to extend heartfelt congratulations to Phil, who has
demonstrated remarkable patience and perseverance in the face of harassment
and intimidation by the Federal Government.  Instead of laying low and
waiting for the outcome of the investigation, Phil took the offensive and
became the leading figure in the effort to provide easy to use, strong
cryptographic applications to the masses. CDT hopes that Phil will remain
active in the fight to encourage the relaxation of export restrictions and
access to strong cryptography.

FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES REMAIN -- EXPORT OF STRONG CRYPTOGRAPHY STILL
PROHIBITED, FUTURE PROSECUTIONS OF CRYPTOGRAPHERS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
STILL POSSIBLE

Although the announcement by the Justice Department is a tremendous
personal victory for Phil Zimmermann, government restrictions on encryption
exports remain firmly in place. As such, the current Administration policy
is a major roadblock to privacy and security, as well as the future of
commerce, on the Internet. The Clinton Administration continues to push for
a national cryptography policy based on key-escrow and limited key lengths.
In addition, the Administration's current policy proposal seeks to use
export controls as a means to influence the domestic marketplace for
cryptographic applications.

The decision to drop the case against Zimmermann also leaves unresolved the
question of whether posting materials on the Internet could result in the
violation of export control regulations.  Although Zimmermann's defense was
based in part on the argument that the First Amendment protects such
postings, that question remains undressed.  As a result, developers of
strong cryptographic applications who make their programs available on the
Internet may in the future face harassment and indictments from the Federal
Government.  This issue is currently pending before Federal Judges in the
Karn and Bernstein cases.

BACKGROUND ON THE DISPUTE

The export of cryptographic applications with key lengths above 40 bits is
currently illegal under the International Trafficking in Arms Regulations
(ITAR).  The Government maintains that these restrictions are necessary in
order to protect national security, and has successfully fought efforts to
repeal or relax the export controls (including efforts by fmr. Rep. Maria
Cantwell (D-WA) in 1994).  Privacy advocates and the computer hardware and
software industry argue that the export controls stifle the development of
strong cryptography both domestically and internationally, undermining
privacy and security on the global information infrastructure.

When Zimmermann published PGP in 1990, it was among the first widely
available and relatively easy to use cryptographic applications, and for
the first time provided the average citizen with the ability to protect
sensitive information on the relatively insecure Internet. In the eyes of
the Government however, PGP represented a threat to national security and
law enforcement. Although the government has announced that it will not
prosecute Zimmerman, government efforts to restrict the distribution of
strong cryptography will no dobut continue.

As privacy advocates, we must not allow Zimmermann's victory to conceal the
larger issues.  Privacy, security, and commerce on the Internet remain
hostage to export restrictions, the National Security Agency, and Clinton
Administration efforts to impose an unworkable key-escrow regime.

(1) TEXT OF LATEST VERSION OF THE CDA -- STILL UNCONSTITUTIONAL

The House/Senate telecommunications reform conference committee has 
released a preliminary draft of the final telecommunications reform 
bill, which includes provisions which would impose broad government 
regulations on constitutionally protected speech online. The text of 
these provisions is attached below.

The attached version of the CDA contains the changes approved at the 
December 6, 1995 conference committee meeting, where members voted to 
adopt Rep. Rick White's proposal but with significant changes, including 
a return to the unconstitutional "indecency" standard (See CDT Policy 
Post No. 32, 12/6/95). 

The conferees have made several important changes to the legislation, 
none of them are particularly favorable to cyberspace-rights advocates. 
Among other things, the latest draft:

* Relies on the vague and blatantly unconstitutional "indecency" 
  standard (Sec 502 (a) - (c))

* Prohibits sending "indecent" material directly to a minor or making 
  indecent material available for display in a manner available to a 
  minor (including world wide web pages, ftp sites, or usenet 
  newsgroups) (Sec 502 (d)).

* No longer contains the provision of the Cox/Wyden/White bill 
  prohibiting the FCC from imposing content or other regulations on the  
  Internet or other interactive media.

* Contains weaker protections for content providers who label content 
  and enable others to block it (e.g., PICS) have been weakened (Sec 502 
  (e)(5).

* Would allow states to impose additional restrictions on non-commercial 
  activities such as free-nets, BBS's, and non-profit content providers 
  (Sec 502 (h)).

* Creates a new crime for the solicitation of minors using a computer, 
  the US mail, or any other means of interstate or foreign commerce (Sec 
  508).

The full text of the new proposal is attached below.

CDT believes that this proposal threatens the very existence of the 
Internet as a means for free expression, education, and political 
discourse. The proposal is an unwarranted, unconstitutional intrusion by 
the Federal government into the private lives of all Americans.  

NEXT STEPS: FINAL AGREEMENT NOT YET REACHED, VOTE COULD OCCUR SOON

As you know, the CDA is part of the massive telecommunications reform 
legislation, which is currently being considered by a House/Senate 
conference committee. 

The conference committee has not reached agreement on several key  
issues, including whether the FCC should be permitted to regulate the 
Internet, broadcast ownership rules, and other issues. Reps. Rick White, 
Chris Cox, and others are currently fighting to retain the provisions 
baring the FCC from regulating online content. A final vote by the 
conferees to send the bill to the full congress will not occur until an 
agreement is reached on this and other outstanding issues.

As of Thursday January 4, 1996, the conferees have NOT yet voted to send 
a version of the legislation to the Full House and Senate for a final 
vote. No vote has been scheduled, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich has 
stated that no vote will occur until Congress finishes work on the 
Budget. 

CDT will continue to fight these provisions, and will work to remove 
them from the final telecommunications bill. We are also preparing to 
fight this issue in court, if necessary.

coalition (of which CDT is a member) against the net-censorship bill. To

Re: Computer Pornography Provisions in Telecommunications Bill
 
Dear Mr. Chairmen:
 
We are writing to urge the conference committee seeking to reconcile the
telecommunications bills passed by the House and Senate include in the
final bill the strongest possible criminal law provisions to address the
growing and immediate problem of computer pornography without any
exemptions, defenses, or political favors of any kind accorded to those
who knowingly participate in the distribution of obscenity to anyone or
indecency to children. While there is no perfect solution to the problem
of computer pornography, Congress could not hope to solve this problem by
holding liable only some who are responsible for the problem.
 
The recent Justice Department prosecution project targeting those who
violated federal child pornography law using America On-Line is
instructive in this regard. More than ninety individuals were targeted for
prosecution although many others, perhaps as many as 3,000 according to
one press report, were originally targeted by the Department of Justice as
potential violators of child pornography laws. Apparently due to a
shortage of investigative and prosecutorial resources, the project was
limited. Since there are insufficient resources to investigate and
prosecute but a fraction of those that are trafficking in child
pornography by computer, then there will likely be even fewer resources
available to investigate and prosecute those involved in obscenity and
indecency.
 
Thousands of individuals both in this country and abroad are regularly
placing obscenity and indecency on the Internet. It is not possible to
make anything more than a dent in the serious problem of computer
pornography if Congress is willing to hold liable only those who place
such material on the Internet while at the same time giving legal
exemptions or defenses to service or access providers who profit from and
are instrumental to the distribution of such material. The Justice
Department normally targest the major offenders of laws. In obscenity
cases prosecuted to date, it has targeted large companies which have been
responsible for the nationwide distribution of obscenity and who have made
large profits by violating federal laws. Prosecution of such companies has
made a substantial impact in curbing the distribution of obscenity, with
many such offenders going out of business altogether. So too will
prosecution of access providers which _knowingly_ traffic in obscenity
have a substantial impact, a far greater impact than just the prosecution
of a person who places one or a few prohibited images on the Internet.
Such a person could not traffic in pornography without the aid or
facilitation of the service or access providers. Indeed, if Congress
includes provisions protecting access or service providers in whatever
bill is finally passed, it is likely that most in this country who are
trafficking in indecency to children or obscenity would continue to do so
since the threat of prosecution would be minuscule, given the numbers of
those currently involved in this activity. It is also likely that those
outside our country who are engaged in these activities would continue to
do so since it would be nearly impossible to extradite them to the United
States for prosecution. Thus, unless all who knowingly participate in such
matters are subject to the law, the Internet will remain the same and
Congress will have failed in its responsibilities to the children and
families of America.
 
Federal law has traditionally assigned equal liability both for those who
commit a crime and those who aid and abet a crime. See Title 18 U.S.C.
Code Section 2: "(a) whoever [sic] commits an offense against the United
States or aids, abets, councils [sic], commands, induces, or procures its
commission, is punishable as a principle [sic]." Service or access
providers who knowingly participate in the distribution of indecency to
children or in obscenity to anyone are aiders and abettors in the
commission of those crimes and thus should have liability under any law
Congress passes. Current federal law on child pornography provides no no
exemption or defense for access providers. Thus, the child pornography law
provides a strong deterrent against trafficking in child pornography for
those who would otherwise knowingly participate in its distribution by
computer whether pedophile or access provider.
 
The changes in law which we support would not hold an access provider
criminally liable for all illegal pornography on the Internet which their
services may be used to obtain. Nor would it require that access providers
check all communications to ensure that no violations of the law are
occurring. They would simply be required to avoid knowing violations of
the law. This is an obligation imposed on all citizens. Technology exists
today for access providers, through a simple process, to target or flag
and remove files containing objectionable material.
 
We support the House-passed language insofar as it addresses obscenity by
amendment Title 18, Sections 1462, 1465, and 1467 of the United States
Code. The provision restricting transmission of indecency in the House-passed
bill, an amendment to Section 1465, is inadequate, and we urge that it be
substantially revised.
 
Attached is the specific language we support which includes the House
passed language on obscenity and includes revisions on both the House
passed language on indecency, which would amend Title 18 and the
Senate-passed language on indecency, which would amend Title 47. The
combination of these provisions, we believe, would provide effective laws
to curb obscenity and indecency on the Internet by establishing that all
who knowingly participate in the distribution or facilitation of obscenity
to anyone or indecency to children would be subject to the law.
 
Thank you for your concern and attention to this matter.

MORALITY IN MEDIA CALLS FOR REJECTION OF SENATOR EXON'S 
'COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT'

Robert Peters, president of Morality in Media, today called for rejection of 
Senator Exon's "Communications Decency Act Of 1995," which was reported out of 
the SenateCommerce Committee on March 23.  Mr. Peters said:

"A Communications Decency Act of 1995 is needed and, clearly, Congress can 
control 'cyberspace' to prohibit obscenity entirely, irrespective of a commercial 
purpose and irrespective of whether 'consenting adults only' are involved, and to 
restrict indecency.

"Obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment, and is already prohibited on 
broadcast, cable and satellite TV and by means of telephone.  Restrictions on 
indecency have also been upheld in the broadcast media and by means of telephone.  

"But Senator Exon's bill has serious constitutional problems and does a
disservice to the American people.  It is a giant step backwards"

Among the bill's defects cited by Mr. Peters are the following:

* It may very well prevent the United States, or any state, from 
  prosecuting much non-commercial computer obscenity in that a person 
  who makes obscenity available cannot be held responsible if it is the
  recipient who "initiates" the transmission (even if that recipient is 
  a child).

* By attempting to ban non-commercial indecent telephone calls and other  
  telecommunications transmissions to adults, the bill violates the 1989 
  united States Supreme Court Sable case, thus rendering
  unconstitutional any protections for children.

* It reduces the protection of the existing Dial-A-Porn law by among 
  other things requiring that commercial violators have actual knowledge 
  of the content of obscene or indecent communications -- a condition 
  easily evaded -- and providing a new "defense" for some commercial 
  providers of obscene telephone communications.

* A provision of the bill aimed at pornography on cable TV speaks to
  programs "unsuitable for children" -- a vague standard suggested to be
  unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in its Erzoznik case, in which
  the Court said: "Speech that is neither obscene to youths or subject 
  to some other legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to 
  protect the young from ... images a legislative body thinks unsuitable   
  for them."
   
 Mr. Peters added:

"Yet other provisions in this bill send a clear message to America's
telecommunications industry that the new Congress will place little if
any responsibility on it for the obscenity available on its systems,
even in circumstances where it 'knows' that such material is available
and has 'editorial control.'
 
"On-line services are not common carriers but despite lip service to
that fact in the Exon bill, on-line services are provided with
protections which should only be available, if at all, to common
carriers."

<title>Communications Daily 6/1/95 Article on New Exon Draft</title>
</head>
<body>
Article (c) 1995 by Warren Publishing. Re-printed with permission.
<p>
From Communications Daily, Thursday June 1 1995
<p>
DRAFT BILL WOULD GIVE FCC ROLE IN REGULATING ON-LINE SPEECH
<p>
Civil Liberties Groups Opposed
<p>
FCC could become involved for first time in efforts to keep
indecent speech off on-line services under new draft proposal for
legislation circulating in Congress.  Proposed changes would be
made in language sponsored by Sen. Exon (D-Neb.) that's included in
S-652.  Newest version further attempts to limit exposure of
children to indecent material, while providing new defenses for
on-line operators.  However, civil liberties groups charge that
attempt at compromise falls short.
<p>
New draft is aimed at information providers who transmit or
make available "any indecent comment, request, suggestion,
proposal, image or other communications to any person under 18
years of age."  Additional language would provide new defenses for
on-line providers, including that they didn't have "editorial
control" over material;  however, provision wouldn't apply to
provider that gave up editorial control with knowledge that company
with control intended to violate law.
<p>
Proposal also would allow FCC to prescribe by regulation
procedures or reasonable steps to prevent transmission of indecent
communications.  According to draft bill:  "Such steps and FCC
procedures may include enabling the user to restrict or prevent
access to communications described in this section."
<p>
Jill Lesser of People for the American Way said that civil
liberties groups "are still not satisfied" with new draft and that
draft language, proposed by on-line service providers, Justice
Dept. and American Family Assn., isn't acceptable.  She said there
have been talks to try to replace Exon's language with bill
proposed by Sen Leahy (D-Vt.) calling for study of on-line
obscenity, but Exon hasn't agreed to withdraw his wording.  Draft
was put together by Exon staff after consultation with industry,
groups concerned with social issues, DoJ.  Officially,
Administration officials said new draft hadn't changed their
position as outlined in letter to Leahy in May that said Exon bill
could pose hazards for law enforcement in addition to harm to civil
liberties.  Senate is expected to take up telecommunications bill
next week after finishing work on terrorism legislation.
<p>
ACLU said in analysis of draft that new language "in its
existing or revised form, violates both free speech and privacy
rights."  It added:  "The Exon amendment cannot be 'fixed.'  It
must be rejected."  Among ACLU's objections:  (1) There's no
definition of obscenity.  Group said govt. has "chosen to stage
prosecutions" to take advantage of community standards, in case of
Tenn. postal inspector downloading material from Cal. bulletin
board.  (2) It would extend liability for obscene or indecent
communications to noncommercial providers, change that would be
"more restrictive" than original Exon bill.  (3) It would provide
new defenses for on-line operators, but ACLU said smaller system
operators probably couldn't afford court case to prove innocence. 
(4) Involvement of FCC should be eliminated:  "Giving federal
regulators the authority to determine the rules for distributing
on-line content will radically affect the freedom of cyberspace and
will have a severe direct effect and an equally severe chilling
effect on on-line speech."
<p>
Center for Democracy & Technology said bill still would be
unconstitutional because regulation of indecency has been approved
by courts only in very limited cases.  It would be impossible to
determine what's indecent, Center said, and prohibited items would
include rap music lyrics or novel Lady Chatterly's Lover, although
those would be available in other locations.  On question of FCC
involvement, Center said:  "Instead of just passing this critical
question off to a regulatory body, Congress must identify both
legal and voluntary means to encourage the development of more and
more flexible and accessible user control techniques."
<p>
Center also said noncommercial information providers would be
put at disadvantage by preempting some state laws, but leave
libraries, schools and others subject to more regulation:  "We find
no valid public policy argument which would accord greater
protection to commercial speech than is granted to noncommercial
users of the net."

<title>Changes to Federal Obscenity Statutes Added by HR 1555</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
<h2>House Approves New Unconstitutional Indecency Statute</h2>
<p>
In addition to passing the Cox/Wyden amendment on August 4, 1995, the House of Representatives also approved changes to existing federal crimial laws covering the distribution of obscenity. The amendments, incorporated as part of the "managers amendment" to the telecommunications reform bill (HR 1555), seek to clarify that current federal law applies to computer networks.
<p>
These new provisions are inconsistent with the Cox/Wyden amendment, and are opposed by several prominant members of both the House and Senate, including Representatives Cox and Wyden as well as Senators Leahy and Finegold.
<p>
CDT believes that these amendments are unconsitutional and overly broad. They would criminalize constitutionally protected speach and would make service providers laible merely for providing access to the Internet to a minor. CDT will work vigoursly to ensure that these provisions are removed from the final telecommunications reform bill.
<p>
Below are the statuates as amended by the House bill:
<p>

Subject: My letter to Leahy supporting the crypto bill
Date: Tue, 05 Mar 1996 10:09:34 -0500
From: Matt Blaze <mab@crypto.com>

Here is the text of a letter I sent to Leahy supporting the "Encrypted
Communications Privacy Act of 1996" being introduced today.  I urge everyone
to check out the bill (should be online on thomas.loc.gov sometime soon);
on balance, I think the bill is a huge step forward and deserves support.

Hon. Patrick Leahy
United States Senate

Dear Senator Leahy:

Thank you for introducing the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of
1996.  As a member of the computer security and cryptology research
community, I have observed firsthand the deleterious effect that the
current regulations governing the use and export of cryptography are
having on our country's ability to develop a reliable and trustworthy
information infrastructure.  Your bill takes an important first step
toward creating regulations that reflect the modern realities of this
increasingly critical technology.

Unlike previous government encryption initiatives such as the
technically-flawed and unworkable ``Clipper'' chip, your bill
re-affirms the role of the marketplace in providing ordinary citizens
and businesses with a full range of choices for securing their private
information.  In particular, by freeing mass-market cryptographic
software and hardware from the burdensome export controls that govern
the international arms trade, the bill will help the American software
industry compete, for the first time, in the international market for
high-quality security products.

Law enforcement need not fear the widespread availability of
encryption; indeed, they should welcome and promote it.  Encryption
thwarts electronic predators by preventing unauthorized access to
private data and computer systems, and the use of strong cryptography
to protect computer networks is becoming as natural and necessary as
the use of locks and burglar alarms to protect our homes and
businesses.  While criminals, too, might occasionally derive some
advantage from the use of cryptography, the benefits of
widely-available encryption technology overwhelmingly favor the honest
user.  By recognizing that those who hold decryption keys on behalf of
others are in a special position of trust, your bill is respectful of
the privacy of law-abiding citizens without introducing impediments to
the government's ability to investigate and prevent crime.

I have also examined the new provision designed to discourage the use
of cryptography by criminals in the furtherance of a felony, and hope
to see your carefully-worded language reinforced by a narrow
interpretation in the courts, consistent with your intent.

Again, thank you for your continued leadership in this area, and I
look forward to doing whatever I can to help you bring encryption
regulations in line with the fast-changing reality of this emerging
technology.

					Sincerely,


					(s) Matt Blaze

<title>Statement of Senator Herb Kohl (D-WI)</title>
<body>
<pre>

OPENING STATEMENT OF SEN. HERB KOHL
HEARING BEFORE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
ON "CYBERPORN"
JUNE 24, 1995


Thank you Mr. Chairman. I want to commend you for calling a hearing on 
this important issue and focussing attention on the need to protect our 
children.

We are all increasingly and distressingly aware of the dark back alleys 
along the information superhighway. Within the last month, the U.S. 
Attorney in Milwaukee accepted a plea bargain from a man who travelled 
those alleys. He was a convicted pedophile and was using the Internet to 
meet his victims. That man "met" someone he thought was a teenager over 
the Internet. He sent her lewd photos of himself. And then, he travelled 
to Milwaukee from his home in Las Vegas thinking he was going to meet 
her at a hotel. Instead, he met the FBI. 

This story should serve as warning -- the Internet can be used by sick 
people. And it should serve as a lesson -- those people can be caught 
and prosecuted.

However, in dealing with this issue, we face two dangers. On the one 
hand, overzealous defense of freedom of the Internet may lead us to 
ignore the real need to protect our children. On the other hand, our 
concern for our children should not provoke unthinking and reckless 
regulation of an important forum for free speech and vital business 
enterprise.

When the Internet first began expanding into the mainstream, we were 
inundated with stories about the wonders available through this system. 
In the last few months, however, horror stories have dominated the news. 
Yet no one -- absolutely no one -- has conducted a systematic and 
balanced study of the extent of obscenity, pornography or indecency on 
the Internet. And no one can quantify the presence of Internet 
predators. Anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong. 

Despite the lack of hard evidence on this issue, no one can deny that 
there is a problem. And the problem is scaring parents and children 
away. 

Defenders of the Internet rightly point out that it does not produce 
these perverted users any more than the U.S. mail system or the 
telephone created pornography and indecency. The Internet is simply a 
new means of communication and transmission that pornographers have 
begun using. It has unique qualities that make it slightly more 
dangerous for children. 

The Internet is not just a breeding ground for perversion. It is a 
booming, entrepreneurial enterprise -- and fantastic environment where 
ideas can be exchanged around the world in a matter of seconds. So we 
must be careful that the Internet's future is not sanitized beyond 
value. 

I am pleased that in response to this problem, the computer industry is 
taking some initiative. Numerous companies are developing techniques for 
screening or filtering out inappropriate material, and some products are 
already available.

The video game industry should serve as a model for our approach to this 
problem. The video game industry has created a rating system for its 
games that help parents control what their children are exposed to. That 
approach has not yet been perfected. But we should move forward along 
these lines.

Those that profit from the Internet have a responsibility to ensure that 
graphic violence or sexually-explicit material does not find its way 
into children's hands. Many entertainment industries employ some level 
of self-policing -- this industry should be no different. The Senate's 
vote earlier this year during the debate on the telecommunications bill 
indicated that lawmakers are serious about seeing this problem 
addressed. It was a signal, in effect, to those in the industry: either 
make certain that children cannot get easy access to pornography or we 
will do it for you.

On the Internet, preventing the problem and empowering parents through 
screening technology should be our top priority. Every parent in America 
would rest easier knowing that action is being taken to prevent a crime 
against their children, rather than simply devising a solid penalty 
after the fact.

Anyone who purposefully sets out to abuse, hurt or tamper with our 
children must be punished. No amount of "wonders" on the Internet can 
excuse a single person who uses it to go after a child. I am not yet 
entirely certain that Senator Grassley's approach works best, since it 
attempts to penalize not just pornography or obscenity but also 
"indecency." But some legislative action may be needed, as the stories 
you will hear today demonstrate.

Mr. Chairman, we have a careful balancing act to perform. We must 
protect the integrity of the Internet. We must resolve any practical and 
constitutional concerns before we enact legislation. But we also must 
protect our children. This hearing will help us achieve all these goals. 

Thank you.

<title>Testimony of Patricia Shao, other of two from Balitmore 
MD</title>
<body>
<pre>

TESTIMONY OF PATRICIA SHAO, MOTHER OF TWO FROM BALITMORE MD

I live in Maryland, and I am the mother of two children, who have grown 
up with the wonders of the computer, and the limitless opportunities it 
offers them.

I am here today to share an experience and to express my concerns as a 
parent, with children growing up on the "Information Superhighway". 

Early this summer, my thirteen-year old daughter went to her friend's 
house to play on the computer. They were in the neighborhood; they were 
properly supervised; and I knew they were safe. It was shocking to 
discover later what they had experienced that afternoon. 

The girls were in a teenage chatroom on America OnLine, and were 
propositioned for "cybersex". Initially, they thought it was funny, 
giggling as you'd expect thirteen-year olds would, but as the requests 
became raunchier, they were frightened.

I, too, am frightened, and appalled at how I am not able to protect my 
children on the Internet. As I continued to research this topic, and 
speak with other children and parents, I have discovered that almost 
seven out of ten have been victimized on the Internet. 

I speak openly with my children, so my daughter was not afraid to come 
to me with this experience. My daughter's friend, however, insisted that 
I could not reveal what happened to her parents. She felt almost guilty, 
as if she were responsible for what happened to her. When does a victim 
become the guilty party in this? Only when the victim is confused and 
happens to be a child. Children as young as ten years old have related 
stories to me of how they were propositioned, and of nude pictures sent 
to them on their computer so they could recognize the sender, who wanted 
to set up a face-to-face meeting.

I understand that I have responsibilities as a parent to protect my 
children. I am in the communications field myself, and am aware of the 
wonderful benefits of using the computer for research, communications, 
creativity, and entertainment. What is disconcerting to me as a parent 
is the fact that I was unaware of the dangers of chatting on-line, and 
of the amount of pornographic material available to anyone with a 
computer and a modem. I've learned that you can download hard-core 
pornography; you can search the Internet to talk to anyone with the same 
interests as yours, be it common or perverse, and that all this can be 
accessed by children free of charge.

I am aware of software and other "lock-out" features that I can download 
into my computer. But what happens when my children are at a neighbor's 
house? What happens if peer pressure builds, and a normal sleep-over 
party of teen-age boys becomes an opportunity to read and view 
pornographic material, material they may not have access to otherwise? 
What happens in multi-cultural homes that own computers? Parents may not 
be literate, but with children who have been educated here and have 
access to this indecent and obscene material. Children today have grown 
up with the computer, and I can safely say they are more computer 
literate than the majority of their parents. 

An education process has to start immediately to help protect our 
children. I am working with Enough is Enough, a wonderful group based in 
Fairfax, Virginia dedicated to protecting children against pornography. 
I have concerned parents and businesses in my community involved in 
starting grassroots organizations to educate both the children and 
parents on this issue.

I believe in freedom of speech. I also believe in responsibility; 
responsibility by the providers of the online service companies to 
protect the innocence of children. If hard-core pornographic materials 
are illegal in the mainstream distribution channels, it should also be 
illegal on the Internet. If society has laws to protect children against 
child molesters, then there should be laws against these child molesters 
looking for victims on the Internet, too. They may have looked on school 
playgrounds yesterday, but the playground for the Children of the 
Nineties is the Information Superhighway.

is essential to promote economic growth, protect citizens' privacy, and
meet the needs of American citizens and businesses.<BR>
	(3) the rights of Americans to the privacy and security of their communications
and in conducting their personal and business affairs should be preserved
and protected; <BR>
	(4) the authority and ability of investigative and law enforcement officers
to access and decipher, in a timely manner and as provided by law, wire
and electronic communications necessary to provide for public safety and
national security should also be preserved; <BR>
	(5) individuals will not entrust their sensitive personal, medical, financial,
and other information to computers and computer networks unless the security
and privacy of that information is assured; <BR>
	(6) business will not entrust their proprietary and sensitive corporate
information, including information about products, processes, customers,
finances, and employees, to computers and computer networks unless the security
and privacy of that information is assured; <BR>

techniques, technologies, programs, or products developed in the marketplace
they desire in order to interact electronically worldwide in a secure, private,
and confidential manner; <BR>
	(10) American companies should be free to compete and to sell encryption
technology, programs, and products;<BR>
	(11) there is a need to develop a national encryption policy that advances
the development of the national and global information infrastructure, and
preserves Americans' right to privacy and the Nation's public safety and
national security;<BR>
	(12) there is a need to clarify the legal rights and responsibilities of
key holders who are voluntarily entrusted with the means to decrypt wire
or electronic communications;<BR>
	(13) the Congress and the American people have recognized the need to balance
the right to privacy and the protection of the public safety and national
security;<BR>
	(14) the Congress has permitted lawful electronic surveillance by investigative
or law enforcement officers only upon compliance with stringent statutory
standards and procedures; and<BR>
	(15) there is a need to clarify the standards and procedures by which investigative
or law enforcement officers obtain assistance from key holders who are voluntarily
entrusted with the means to decrypt wire or electronic communications, including
such communications in electronic storage. </BLOCKQUOTE>

            CHAIRMAN OF THE ONLINE POLICY COMMITTEE

                     SILVER SPRING, MARYLAND


         HEARINGS ON S. 892 AND INDECENCY ON THE INTERNET 

July 24, 1995

Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am William W. Burrington, 
Chairman of the Online Policy Committee of the Interactive Services 
Association and Assistant General Counsel and Director of Government 
Affairs for America Online, Inc. in Vienna, Virginia. I appear before 
you today on behalf of the Interactive Services Association ("ISA") and 
its Online Policy Committee.1

As the oldest non-profit North American association serving businesses 
that deliver telecommunications-based interactive services to consumers, 
the ISA has been responsive to concerns about the social and political 
impact of this new interactive medium that millions of Americans use 
every day. ISA's 300-plus members (see Appendix A) represent the full 
spectrum of industries now active in delivering personal interactive 
services. ISA's membership includes companies from the advertising, 
broadcasting, cable, computer, financial services, marketing, 
publishing, telephone, and travel industries. 

We understand that the purpose of these hearings is to discuss the 
responsibility of interactive online services, including those that 
provide access to the Internet, for the act of transmitting material to 
minors that is deemed to be indecent. Our industry is concerned about 
children's access via online services to materials that their parents 
believe to be inappropriate. We also want to ensure that Congress 
creates an effective response that will not devastate the myriad 
benefits to our country that will result from active participation in 
the National Information Infrastructure. We want to work with Congress 
to protect children, empower parents to screen out unwanted material, 
and preserve constitutional guarantees of free speech, free press, and 
individual privacy.

In its zeal to "clean up" the content of a small portion of electronic 
communications, S.892 would target for liability online service 
providers while ignoring content providers and subscribers who create, 
control, and upload indecent material onto networks. For example, 
although access by minors to Playboy magazine may be restricted in some 
states, it is not restricted under federal law. This legislation, 
however, creates the anomalous result of punishing online service 
providers for permitting the electronic distribution of Playboy to 
minors although federal law does not punish the publisher. This is not 
to say that the publisher should be punished; we simply cannot agree 
that the constitution would permit computer distribution to be 
criminalized when the publishing of the same material is not.

What's more, the online providers would be liable under S.892 for 
indecent communication regardless of any measures they may take to limit 
access or to screen content providers on their system. Statutory 
defenses for providers who make good faith efforts to screen and block 
indecent materials to minors would provide an industry incentive to 
develop effective blocking and screening devices. The lack of such 
defenses in S.892 would serve as a disincentive for investing in such 
efforts.

ISA is also concerned about the criminalization of indecent speech, 
given that this speech is protected by the Constitution and can be 
restricted only in a few narrowly defined situations. The Supreme 
Court's Sable decision mandates that regulations on indecent speech must 
be narrowly drawn to protect minors without unnecessary interference 
with the First Amendment. The regulation proposed by S.892 is not the 
least restrictive alternative. It prohibits any "communication that 
contains indecent material" as well as indecent material itself directed 
at minors. This type of regulation is not likely to pass constitutional 
muster. 

Rather than criminalizing the mere transmission of certain materials, 
Congress should support and encourage the entrepreneurial spirit of the 
interactive services industry to build parental empowerment tools and 
encourage the industry to make such solutions widely available to 
consumers. Even without any legislation, the market is already acting to 
address the concerns of parents, educators, and others who are 
interested in controlling the flow of information accessible via 
computer. Just last week, companies such as America Online Inc., Webster 
Network Strategies, SurfWatch Software, and Netscape announced new 
products and services that allow users to screen from their online 
systems content they find offensive.

In my testimony today, I would like to address several issues: 

1. Constitutional guarantees of free speech and press should be 
   cautiously guarded. We urge Congress to consider the least 
   restrictive alternatives in achieving the goal of protecting minors 
   from indecent materials;

2. The online service provider industry should be encouraged to provide  
   voluntary editorial control over its services and to continue its 
   research and development of parental empowerment technology tools. 
   This industry should not be cast in the role of national censor, 
   determining which information may be fit for children, but 
   nonetheless subject to criminal liability if it guesses incorrectly 
   in any given instance; and 

3. The ISA agrees with the Department of Justice and the American Family 
   Association that existing laws suffice to punish the use of computer 
   networks for obscenity and child pornography. We believe that current 
   law negates the need for new legislation, either federally or at the 
   state level.

Before I address these points, I would like to provide an overview of 
the online service industry.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

Online service providers offer interactive services to millions of 
subscribers across the United States. In fact, there are presently over 
8 million subscribers to computer-based online services. "Interactive 
services" are easy-to-use, telecommunications-based services designed 
for information exchange, communications, transactions, and 
entertainment. These services can be accessed by a personal computer, 
telephone, screen telephone, or television. Online service providers may 
simply transmit the communications created by others, or they may 
additionally offer content such as "bulletin boards" or "home pages." 

Interactive services are unlike any previous communications media. When 
an individual listens to the radio or watches television, the Supreme 
Court has recognized that the individual may be "surprised" by an 
indecent message; that is, by the time the viewer has seen the message, 
it is too late to avoid it or look away. This is the rationale behind 
some time, place, and manner restrictions on speech communication 
through such media. In the online medium, it is much less likely that a 
user will be surprised by indecent or obscene material. The online 
medium generally requires that a user take affirmative steps, such as 
using electronic mail or accessing a particular service through the 
click of an icon or typing in a particular address, prior to receiving 
communications. Although random online assault by indecent images or 
messages is possible, it is certainly not the norm.

I really can't talk about interactive services without mentioning the 
Internet. The Internet is a world-wide phenomenon available in over 90 
countries, connecting some 5 million different computer systems, and 
accessed by an estimated 10 - 30 million people. These connected 
computer systems are operated by universities and other nonprofits, 
research institutions, governments, businesses, and individuals. There 
is no central governing body or policy governing worldwide user 
behavior. Further, some obscene and indecent material originates in 
countries other than the United States, and is therefore beyond the 
practical reach of American law.

The vast majority of all communication available over the Internet and 
other online services, however, is educational, informative, or 
entertaining. The ability to access and successfully use a variety of 
information will increase the productivity and enjoyment of American 
life. For example, American students have vast educational opportunities 
literally at their fingertips via the Internet. The majority of 
educational databases currently originate in the United States. Should 
Internet access be cut off because of the threat of criminal liability, 
students across the globe will have access to information that is 
withheld from American students. Not only would this handicap our future 
by denying educational opportunities to students, but it would handicap 
America's international competitiveness as well by decreasing access to 
productivity-enhancing services.

Finally, interactive television services will bring video and other 
programming into households on demand. Currently, online services enable 
millions of people to communicate with each other and to access news, 
weather, sports, and financial information through the touch of a 
keyboard. These services enable personal communication across America as 
well as around the globe.

Interactive services empower their users. Since the beginning of 
consumer online services in the early 80s, one key fact has emerged and 
is often overlooked. Tools provided by interactive services can act as 
an extension of the person, compensating for differing abilities related 
to, for example, age or physical health. Electronic grocery shopping can 
be both a convenience to many, and a lifeline to a homebound individual 
who is seeking to stay independent. Communities, too, will experience 
increasing social and political empowerment through electronic 
communication, forums, information sharing, and collaborative planning. 
Perhaps more than any other medium that has been used by American 
citizens, interactive services support the fundamental principles of our 
democracy. And as services evolve to multimedia presentation, so, too, 
will applications tailored to those of us with hearing, speech, sight, 
mobility or other challenges. This empowerment of the public offers a 
unique opportunity for individuals, parents, and families to make 
conscious choices about the types of material they wish to receive via 
their computer terminals.

With this basic overview in mind, I will now address the first of the 
issues:

I. S. 892 IS NOT THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVE FOR LIMITING ACCESS 
   TO CERTAIN SPEECH. 

Let me clarify that S.892 applies to online service providers only to 
the extent that they are transmitting material. That is, for the 
purposes of this bill, it is not relevant whether the online provider 
was the source of the indecent communication to a minor or if it merely 
transmitted an indecent communication that originated elsewhere. S.892 
is simply unworkable because it is not narrowly focused on the bad 
actors; online service providers cannot police and be aware of the 
specific content of each communication, and yet they are penalized for 
transmitting certain communications. Conspicuously absent from S.892 is 
any mention of the creator of the offending materials.

Online services are entitled to at least the same level of First 
Amendment protection accorded to other news disseminators, such as 
newspapers. See Miami Herald Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974). In 
fact, online service providers are likely entitled to even greater 
protection because of the virtually infinite capacity of the medium to 
accommodate all speakers and points of view. It is precisely for this 
reason that legislators must use an abundance of caution prior to 
regulating and criminalizing online speech activities. As the Supreme 
Court cautioned in its landmark decision New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 
U.S. 254, 279 (1964), such a limitation on speech "dampens the vigor and 
limits the variety of public debate... [and] is inconsistent with the 
First Amendment."

As the U.S. Supreme Court has acknowledged, expression that is indecent 
but not obscene is protected by the First Amendment. Consequently, to 
regulate indecent expression in a constitutional manner, "[i]t is not 
enough to show that the Government's ends are compelling; the means must 
be carefully tailored to achieve those ends." Sable Communications of 
California, Inc. v. F.C.C., 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989). S. 892 is not a 
narrowly tailored effort to serve the compelling interest of preventing 
minors from being exposed to indecent communications on computer 
networks. Furthermore, it fails to encourage industry to develop further 
measures that will improve user control over online services. 

S. 892 would depart from the federal criminal law's general rule that 
the originators of obscene material are liable for its distribution, not 
the entities who unwittingly carry out the distribution, such as a 
telephone network, a trucking company, or a courier service. See, e.g., 
18U.S.C. $$ 1462, 1465. Without a federal law that prohibits a person 
from using a computer to transmit an indecent communication to a minor, 
S.892 proposes to impose criminal liability on access providers who 
permit others to use their computer network facilities to transmit 
indecent communications to minors. That is, the bill proposes to punish 
access providers for permitting others to do something that federal law 
does not prohibit. It is, in the words of the Supreme Court in Sable, 
"another case of 'burn[ing] the house to roast the pig.'" The new S.892 
approach is not likely to survive constitutional scrutiny. 

Moreover, the so-called dial-a-porn regulations that evolved after 
nearly a decade of constitutional attack contained "safe harbor" 
defenses for industry. See Dial Information Services v. Thornburgh, 
938F.2d 1535 (2d Cir. 1991). S. 892 provides no such defenses, again 
rendering it constitutionally vulnerable on the grounds that there are 
other approaches less restrictive but just as effective in achieving its 
goal of denying access by minors to indecent communications on computer 
networks. 

Finally, in the context of private communications such as electronic 
mail, S.892 places online providers in an impossible position: it holds 
them criminally responsible for indecent communications to minors while 
the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 ("ECPA") forbids them 
from monitoring electronic mail. See 18 U.S.C. $$ 2701, 2702. The bill 
would treat online providers differently than other communications 
carriers: even with regard to communications that rises to the level of 
criminal activity, neither the Postal Service, Federal Express, nor Bell 
Atlantic is expected to know the contents of hand-written mail or of 
telephone conversations between persons conspiring in a criminal 
enterprise, nor are they held liable for failing to prevent any harm 
that may result.

II. VOLUNTARY EDITORIAL CONTROL AND USER EMPOWERMENT TOOLS ARE THE MOST 
    EFFECTIVE CONSTITUTIONAL APPROACH TO PREVENTING ACCESS BY CHILDREN  
    TO INDECENT MATERIALS. 

As a matter of public policy, Congress should rely on the 
entrepreneurial spirit of the interactive services industry to build 
parental empowerment tools and encourage the industry to work together 
to ensure that such solutions are widely available. Technological relief 
is currently available and more is under way. Prosecutors appear to have 
the prosecutorial tools they need, too. The Justice Department certainly 
has not asked for new criminal laws to combat smut on the Internet. 

While industry has demonstrated its willingness to serve an editorial 
function, a current obstacle to wide implementation of measures to block 
or filter out offensive materials is the threat of liability for any 
offending material that may fail to get screened. Two months ago in New 
York, for example, Prodigy was found to be a "publisher" of libelous 
statements made by a subscriber on one of its online bulletin boards "in 
large measure" because of measures that Prodigy took to be "a family 
oriented computer network." Prodigy was liable even though it was (and 
is) unable to control the content of user communications and was unaware 
of the particular offending statement. Congress should not now legislate 
another disincentive -- criminal liability -- rather, it should continue 
to let the market respond to the demand for editing functions and 
screening tools.

In addition, the online service provider industry has developed a broad 
array of technological screening devices, with the promise of more to 
come. It is sad and ironic that S.892 intends to reward industry for its 
efforts with criminal liability. The current industry initiatives 
include the following:

First, providers can control the audience. At America Online, for 
example, we require a credit card or checking account to open an online 
account, which, like the dial-a-porn regulation's credit card 
requirement, presumes that the new subscriber is an adult. 

Second, providers can help the subscribers control the audience. For 
example, at Prodigy, the registered head of each household, using a 
credit card for verification, must activate an Internet connection for 
each family member. America Online within two months will expand its 
existing parental control offerings with a new feature that will enable 
parents to block access to all but the "Kids Only" area of the service 
with content targeted and programmed specifically for kids. This will 
allow parents to have access to all America Online features, but limit 
their children's access to the Kids Only area.

Third, providers can exercise control over the topics of the chat lines 
and conferences that they sponsor and, consistent with federal law, 
monitor many of these activities. On these chat lines and conferences, 
online providers enforce rules that require that messages transmitted 
for posting be relevant to the subject of these activities. 

Fourth, while online operators cannot legally monitor e-mail, they act 
on complaints brought to their attention by subscribers who receive 
offensive material by e-mail. All that a subscriber needs to do is 
forward the e-mail to the provider; at that point, the provider can take 
appropriate action based on the message. If, for example, the sender is 
a subscriber of CompuServe, CompuServe can act against the sender if he 
or she has breached the operating rules. If the e-mail message indicates 
possible unlawful activity, the online provider will forward the 
material to law enforcement officials for investigation. 

Fifth, particularly with regard to the Internet, many providers are 
incorporating powerful new blocking and filtering technology to empower 
parents to make choices -- consistent with their own particular values 
-- about the material that their children can access. Currently at 
America Online, for example, parents are able to block their children's 
access to Internet newsgroups while permitting them other access to the 
Internet. In addition, America Online last week announced a relationship 
with SurfWatch Software, Inc. that will provide its adult subscribers 
with easy tools to block unwanted inappropriate material on the World 
Wide Web. SurfWatch, which also is available to families who do not 
subscribe to commercial online services, incorporates a roster of sites 
known to carry sexually explicit content that is automatically updated 
each month. 

NET NANNY and CYBERsitter are among other affordable products for 
controlling children's access to the Internet that are currently 
available. Another software product, WEBTrack School Edition (SE), which 
its developer recently announced would be provided at no charge to 
primary and secondary schools, gives school administrators the 
capability to restrict access to five categories of Internet sites (sex, 
drugs, hate speech, criminal skills, and online gambling) while allowing 
full access to the rest of the Internet's resources.

Among the more innovative proposals on the drawing boards is "KidCode," 
currently being developed by Internet standards developers. KidCode 
would establish voluntary labeling systems that identify Internet 
information that is inappropriate for children. These labels could then 
be used in new ways to empower parents and educators to select the 
Internet content that children could access.

The attention that content on computer networks has recently received 
continues to spur industry to invest in technologies that will further 
empower parents to protect their children from access to inappropriate 
materials.

But all of the empowerment tools in the world will not work unless we 
educate parents about their existence and use. Consequently, in 
conjunction with the efforts to deploy new empowerment tools, the ISA 
will launch an online and off-line Parental Empowerment Program next 
month. Even preceding this effort, which may include information kits 
that parents can request via an 800-number service and World Wide Web 
Home Page, the ISA and seven major online operators teamed with the 
National Center for Missing Children to publish a pamphlet entitled 
"Child Safety on the Information Highway." (See Appendix B). The 
pamphlet is available at no charge by calling 1-800-THE-LOST and over 
all the major online services. This pamphlet advises parents in setting 
rules and guidelines for their children's online activities, and helps 
parents understand the risks involved on the information superhighway. 
Our goal is to educate parents better about the tools available to keep 
indecent and other inappropriate materials out of the hands of computer-
literate minors.

The goal of empowering and educating parents is to allow them to make 
their own choices and to customize those choices depending upon the age 
of their children and their own family values, not those of some 
monolithic government or special interest group. Finally, we realize 
that parents may not be as computer savvy as their own kids. For that 
reason, we have made all of our parental empowerment tools very simple 
and easy to implement with the click of a mouse. Our goal -- to make 
these technology features easier for parents to use than setting the 
clock on their VCR.

Technology is one solution; parental awareness is another. These will 
work far better than cold words in a criminal statute to protect 
America's children from inappropriate material on the Internet. Indeed, 
the new technological tools will permit parents who wish to do so to 
block out a whole lot more than just material that online providers, if 
they permit its transmission, will go to jail for. 

III. NEW LEGISLATION IS UNNECESSARY TO MEET CONGRESSIONAL GOALS. 

Law enforcement agencies and prominent pro-family groups agree that 
current laws already authorize prosecutions of constitutionally 
unprotected speech on computer networks.2 Illegal conduct over computer 
networks has been punished under existing federal laws concerning 
trafficking in obscenity, child pornography, harassment, illegal 
solicitation or luring of minors, and threatening to injure someone. The 
desire to create additional legislation in this area is somewhat curious 
in light of the ability to prosecute wrongdoers under current laws and 
of the prosecutions that have taken place. 

To the extent that particular gaps may appear in the future, or if any 
obstacles arise to prosecution of those who make obscenity or indecency 
available to minors, Congress should examine whether there is a need for 
additional training or additional resources for enforcement of the 
current laws. No less an authority than the Department of Justice, the 
agency responsible for investigating and prosecuting these crimes, has 
requested not precipitous action but rather an in-depth analysis of the 
complex legal and policy issues surrounding the goals of protecting 
children while respecting First Amendment and privacy rights of computer 
users.3 

It is also critical that Congress preserve a uniform national standard 
governing the behavior of online service providers. During the past 
year, at least five states -- Connecticut, Georgia, New Jersey, 
Oklahoma, and Virginia -- have enacted laws aimed at obscenity or 
harassment on computer networks. These statutes may create standards 
that are inconsistent with the goal of incenting industry to create 
technological tools to block and screen particular communications. 
Again, industry should be encouraged to continue to work with 
communities to develop tools that allow the appropriate levels of access 
to and control of online services.

Multiple regulations would be more than burdensome for online service 
providers; they may be impossible to satisfy for technical and economic 
reasons. Moreover, state requirements could conflict with one another, 
creating a situation in which compliance in one state could create 
culpability in another. Finally, because service providers are unable to 
accommodate varying standards, they would be forced to meet the content 
and activity standards of the most restrictive state. In this way, one 
state legislature, rather than the federal government, would control the 
content of our country's contribution to the global information 
superhighway.

Permitting every state to adopt its own standard would lead to 
uncertainty for business and drive away market participants, thereby 
severely undermining our nation's ability to develop and make use of the 
National Information Infrastructure to promote national economic, 
educational, and social goals.

CONCLUSION

Perhaps more than any other medium that has ever been used by Americans, 
online services support the fundamentals of our participatory democracy. 
Our government's role should be to facilitate -- not inhibit -- the 
development of the National and Global Information Infrastructure. And 
that is what government has done to date. The Congress has begun making 
congressional information available online; the White House and some 
federal agencies have set up sites on the World Wide Web; and federal 
agencies have established advisory committees to make recommendations on 
policies for the NII. 

We believe that for every child empowered by the Internet's benefits 
there should be a parent empowered to protect his or her children from 
the risks that exist on the Internet, as elsewhere in life. We believe 
that empowering technology, and education not cumbersome regulation, is 
the most effective and least intrusive means for serving the public 
interest in protecting minors.

Any changes in federal law should seek to remove any disincentives for 
creating "child safe" areas rather than to impose criminal liability 
upon online providers for permitting others to engage in conduct not 
prohibited by federal law or S. 892 -- the transmission by others of 
indecent materials to minors.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Markus states: "Again, we are 
committed to protecting children while also respecting First Amendment 
and privacy rights. While substantial progress has been made in your 
revised proposal, it still raises a number of complex legal and policy 
issues that call for in-depth analysis prior to congressional action."

                               (S. 892)

I.	The Challenge of a New Medium

My name is Mike Godwin, and I am staff counsel for the Electronic 
Frontier Foundation. I'd like to thank you, Mr. Chairman, on behalf of 
my organization, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, for allowing EFF to 
submit testimony concerning the important issues, and significant 
problems, we believe are raised by S. 892. One of our goals at EFF is to 
assist policymakers and legislators in developing a framework to 
understand the legal and social significance of what is, in effect, a 
wholly new medium -- computer communications. EFF is dedicated to 
expanding and preserving the democratic potential of this new medium, 
whose social and political significance may ultimately exceed that of 
the very first mass medium, the printing press. The issues raised by 
computer communications transcend partisan politics and require of us 
all that we stretch our imaginations -- the worst mistake we can make on 
the threshold of this revolution is to assume that this new medium is, 
so far as the Constitution and laws of the United States are concerned, 
essentially the same as broadcasting, or more or less similar to 
telephony. Computer communications -- and especially those 
communications that depend on computer networks of national or global 
reach, raise new problems and questions for lawmakers. At the same time, 
this medium promises to be the fulfillment of our oldest First Amendment 
values. 

But I come here not just as a lawyer who is concerned about the First 
Amendment. I'm also a father. My little girl will be the first person in 
my family to have grown up with the Internet. As a parent, I'm deeply 
concerned with protecting Ariel from bad material and from bad people. 
And this concern is the other reason for my being here -- I want to help 
ensure that whatever legislation or policy comes from Congress regarding 
the Internet will help me as a parent in protecting my little girl, 
while at the same time ensuring that she's able to benefit fully from 
access to the Net.

While I do want to talk a bit about some of the Constitutional issues 
raised by S. 892, I don't want to duplicate the thoughtful, thorough 
analysis submitted to this committee by Jerry Berman of the Center for 
Democracy and Technology. Instead, I want to focus on giving you a 
better historical and technical understanding of why computer 
communications are fundamentally new and different from previous 
communications media. 

Now, figuring out the proper legal framework for the Net is tricky. Even 
if you didn't know anything else about computer communications, you'd 
know it's tricky from one simple fact: you've got Rush Limbaugh and Newt 
Gingrich and the ACLU on one side of the issue, and Senators Robert Dole 
and Dianne Feinstein on the other side. What this tells us, I think, is 
that one's approach to making policy about computer communications 
derives less from one's political affiliations than it does from how one 
sees it in relation to traditional communications media. 

You see, the more you know about computer networks and the Internet, the 
clearer it becomes that the these networks are different in several 
respects from traditional communications media such as print, 
broadcasting, and the telephone. And these differences, once grasped, 
entail that top-down, government-centered approaches to protecting 
children will be ineffective. They also entail that the "least 
restrictive means" test of First Amendment jurisprudence will lead to 
different results in this medium from those results we've seen in 
traditional media, such as telephony. (See, e.g., Sable Communications 
v. FCC, 1989). We begin with what I promise will be a short history of 
the Internet. 


II.	The Humble Beginnings

In spirit, at least, the Internet--the global "network of networks" that 
is increasingly the link among commercial online providers, businesses, 
government, computer bulletin-board systems, and other modes of computer 
communications -- was conceived 30 years ago by Paul Baran, a RAND 
Corporation researcher. In a highly theoretical paper, Baran addressed a 
quintessentially Cold War problem: How could U.S. authorities 
successfully communicate in the aftermath of a nuclear war? 

The problem was that traditional communications network designs were 
vulnerable to strategic attacks. Hubs and main arteries could be 
destroyed, isolating whole sections of the country. And any central 
control authority would be a particularly enticing target for a surgical 
strike.

Baran developed a theory of a truly decentralized, "distributed" 
communications network, with no central authority, and no main hubs or 
arteries. Any given communication on the network was sliced into what 
later were called "packets," and each packet was separately addressed, 
then thrust by the network in the general direction of the 
communication's destination. Each packet might take a separate route 
across the network, and some of those routes might involve serious 
detours (a packet might travel from Chicago to Seattle by way of Texas, 
for example). If a particular route had been damaged by natural disaster 
or military attack, a given packet would simply continue trying new 
routes until it found one that worked. The recipient computer on the far 
end would collect each packet as it arrived and assemble it in the 
correct order. This kind of network design probably sounds highly 
inefficient. That's because it is -- but it is also highly robust, and 
it turns out to be very difficult to guarantee that you've stopped a 
given message from reaching its destination.

Baran's theoretical design remained just that -- theory -- for several 
years. Then, in 1969, a group of engineers working for ARPA (the federal 
government's Advanced Research Projects Agency), actually planted the 
first seeds of what later became known as the Internet. Although these 
engineers had never heard of Paul Baran or his paper, they'd brought his 
theory to fruition anyway. And once the RAND Corporation and other early 
participants in this network recognized that ARPA had implemented a 
working version of Baran's concept, they lost no time in playing up the 
military value of the new network (which turned out to be a plus when 
seeking appropriations under the constraints of the Mansfield 
Amendment). 

At first it was called the ARPAnet -- only later was the term "Internet" 
coined. The new network grew quickly: in late 1969, there were only four 
computers on the network, but by 1972 there were 37 sites. By the 1990s, 
the number of computer sites on the Internet had grown exponentially -- 
in 1992, Internet sites numbered in the hundreds of thousands; this year 
they number in the millions.

One reason the Internet grew so rapidly is that one doesn't have to 
construct special wires or conduits to connect to it -- connectivity 
depend on software standards, and not on hardware. And connecting to the 
Internet cost the taxpayer little or nothing, since each node was 
independent, and had to handle its own financing and its own technical 
requirements. It is no wonder that communications traffic on the 
Internet has increased 1000 times between January 1988 and October 1994. 

Also fueling the explosive growth of the Internet was the increasing 
availability and decreasing price of desktop computers. Any one of the 
desktop (or even laptop) computers commonly sold today can become part 
of the Internet.

III. Democratic and Economic Opportunities 

But the cheapness of computing power these days tells only part of the 
story. The rest lies in the answer to the question of why so many people 
want to be connected to the Internet. While there are many uses of the 
Internet --
e-mail, long-distance computing, file transfers, searches of remote 
databases -- there is no doubt that one of the most compelling reasons 
people are excited about the Internet is freedom of speech. 

You see, unlike every other mass medium that has ever existed, the 
Internet (and similar computer networks) has no central authority. There 
is no person in charge of the "printing press," no "editor-in-chief," no 
holder of a broadcast license. Americans have discovered that one can 
reach a large audience on the Internet without having to assemble a lot 
of capital or seek the approval of an editor. In this the Internet is 
similar to the telephone (no one tries to edit your phone conversations 
while they're happening), but the potential scope of the communications 
are far greater. While it might take millions of dollars to start on 
urban newspaper or TV station, it takes only a few hundred dollars to 
reach large audiences. If, as A.J. Liebling once commented, freedom of 
the press belongs to those who own one, the Internet suggests that we 
all may someday own one.

In short, the First Amendment's free-press clause, which many citizens 
still take to be a right reserved to the highly capitalized media 
establishment, has suddenly become a meaningful right for every 
individual American.

This kind of empowerment of individuals is something new under the sun, 
and it blurs traditional distinction between "content producers" and 
"consumers" (everyone on these computer networks can produce "content"). 
This may blur the line between reporter and reader -- to take only the 
most recent example: it was an ad-hoc group of individual Internet users 
who assembled the material that demonstrated the flaws in the Martin 
Rimm/Carnegie Mellon pornography study that you may have heard about. 
And while the mainstream media might have taken months to discover the 
study's flaws, these individuals uncovered them in mere weeks. 

To touch briefly on some other things that make this medium different: 
since computer hardware and software are ubiquitous and less expensive 
all the time, the medium cannot be considered a "scarce" resource in the 
way the Supreme Court characterized the broadcasting spectrum in Red 
Lion. 

And since content is primarily "pulled" by user choices rather than 
"pushed" by content producers, the medium lacks the "pervasive" 
character of broadcasting that was central to the Court's decision in 
the Pacifica case.

Finally, the relatively low cost of acquiring access to the Internet 
means that would-be entrepreneurs face relatively low barriers to entry 
into this new market. Now that the government no longer plays even a 
nominal role in administering the Internet, the international network of 
networks is becoming a playing field for pure capitalism. To start a 
successful business on the Internet, you don't need to be a millionaire, 
and you don't need venture capital -- all you need is a good idea. 

Ill-considered regulation, however, could thwart both the democratic and 
the economic promise of computer communications. S. 892, with its clear 
intent to impose new duties and broader legal risks for service 
providers, would simultaneously chill freedom of speech and distort the 
market for services by raising barriers to entry. What exacerbates this 
problem is that a provider's liability for content hinges not on legal 
obscenity, but on the far broader, far vaguer concept of "indecency," a 
term imported from the realm of broadcasting regulation whose meaning 
has never been defined by either Congress or the Supreme Court. And even 
if the term had been defined, it would be inapplicable to a medium that 
is neither "scarce" nor "pervasive" in the Constitutional senses of 
those terms. Our federal government's special role in regulating the 
content of the broadcast media and of the dial-a-porn services is 
grounded in particular factual findings about the characteristics of 
those media. There have been no such findings with regard to computer 
communications, and, given the nature of the medium as discussed above, 
it is difficult to see how there could be.

Compounding the "chilling effect" this legislation would have on lawful 
speech is the sheer ineffectiveness of the measure when it comes to 
willfully illegal communications. Because of the decentralized, "bomb-
proof" nature of the Internet, an individual provider's decision to 
censor certain content may have no effect at all with regard to its 
general availability. This is especially true when one remembers that an 
increasing number of Internet sites are operated in foreign countries, 
and their owners, while theoretically extraditable and prosecutable in 
the United States, would rarely be meaningfully deterred -- they know 
that only a very few foreign offenders will ever be pursued by a U.S. 
attorney. In general, a foreign criminal using computer networks to 
commit a crime in the United States can dodge both the providers' 
attempts at monitoring and the law-enforcement agencies' attempts at 
policing by originating message traffic offshore or by routing illegal 
information through a chain of intermediate sites that obscures its 
origin. S. 892 would not even pose a meaningful threat to those who prey 
on children -- no limit on "indecency" prevents the solicitation of 
innocent children with nonobscene, nonindecent speech.

IV.	A Better Approach.

As a parent who happens to be a lawyer, I know that federal and state 
laws already define a framework for the prosecution of those trafficking 
in obscenity, those who possess or distribute child pornography, and 
those who prey on children. It is clear that the legal tools are in 
place, but Senator Grassley's instincts are right when he perceives that 
there is still a gap in the defense of children that needs to be filled. 
One thing we know about those who engage in child sexual abuse, for 
example, is that they are rarely deterred by legal risks -- even in the 
face of likely prosecution they are driven by their sickness to continue 
preying on children. And as a parent I can assure you that it is little 
comfort to me to know that if such an offender harms my child, that 
person may be caught, prosecuted, and imprisoned at some point -- the 
damage, which may last a lifetime, has already been done.

This is why I believe that the right role for Congress to play is to 
encourage the development of software filters that prevent my child and 
others from being harmed in the first place. 

Recall that the basic technology we're talking about here is the 
computer -- the most flexible, programmable, "intelligent" technology we 
build and market. Filtering software enables parents to screen certain 
language, certain kinds of content, certain people, or certain areas on 
the networks from their children.

Such an approach does no damage to First Amendment values (it does not, 
for example, put a nonlawyer hobbyist who operates a tiny computer 
bulletin-board system in the position of having to determine what is 
"indecent"), yet it does solve the problems (e.g., solicitation through 
nonindecent communications, or offenders who conceal the origin of their 
harmful communications) that S. 892 has no hope of addressing. 

Furthermore, since such tools are designed to be customizable, parents 
are empowered to set their own standards of what is acceptable for their 
children, rather than relying on what the nonelected officials at the 
FCC choose to include under the definition of "indecency." For example, 
even if the FCC determines that detailed information about safe-sex 
techniques is not indecent, a parent who believes that her children 
should receive all their sexual information from her and not from the 
Internet could customize the family computer's "filters" to block that 
information. 

V. Conclusions

We already have the laws in place. Federal and state laws prohibit the 
distribution of obscenity, every state I know of has laws prohibiting 
the exposure of children to inappropriate or harmful material. Federal 
and state laws prohibit child porn and child abuse, regardless of the 
medium used to facilitate it.

Speaking as a concerned parent and a lawyer, I believe the question 
isn't "Do we need more criminal laws?" -- it's "What can we do to 
supplement the legal framework with policies and tools that empower 
parents to protect their children and preserve the values of their 
families?" And answering that question will require the Congress to 
draft laws and support policies that are grounded not in simplistic 
analogies to old media, but in a thorough understanding of this new 
medium and of what makes it different. 

Members of the committee, you are at a crossroads. Down one road lies a 
future in which parental rights are supported by a Congress that has 
abandoned the outdated, big-government approach to solving social 
problems. Like the parents and children whose letters to you follow my 
statement here, we hope for a Congress that does not set the First 
Amendment and welfare of families against other, but that instead 
chooses policies that strengthen both.



LETTERS FROM MAMIE AND HOWARD RHEINGOLD


To the Members of the Committee,

I am Mamie Rheingold. I am ten years old, and I have been using e-mail 
since I was eight years old. I also use the World Wide Web sometimes to 
help with my homework.

When I started using e-mail, my dad told me to use good sense. Like when 
somebody calls my house on the telephone and asks me whether I am home 
alone, I know I don't have to answer that person. And my parents taught 
me that if somebody calls on the telephone and I don't know them, and I 
feel funny about something they say or ask, I should talk to my mom and 
dad and not say anything. The same thing with e-mail. If people ask me 
personal questions and I dont know them, I ask my dad. I like to send e-
mail to my dad when he travels, and get e-mail from him. And I have a 
few penpals. It really isnt a problem.

Sometimes, I can use the World Wide Web for homework. My dad found a 
place where I can type in the name of what I am looking for and then I 
can click on what it finds and see pictures from outer space or other 
things. It's like having an encyclopedia that has movies, too. 

I think kids need to learn how to use things and parents need to trust 
us to use them the right way and not use them the wrong way.

To the United States Senate and the Members of the Committee: 

I am a parent, a PTA member, and an active volunteer in our daughter's 
public school. I believe very strongly that parents have an obligation 
to teach our children values, to give them the opportunity to make their 
own moral choices, and to help them understand the media such as 
television and internet that are so important in their lives today. 

I would like to be able to have control over the information my daughter 
receives through the television or the internet, but I don't believe it 
is right to give the State the power to exercise that control. Parents 
and teachers, not the government, are the ones who ought to determine 
what information and values are appropriate in our homes and schools. 

Democracy in America was founded upon freedom of expression. 
Communications technologies have made it possible to spread 
objectionable material. I know that tools for FILTERING information that 
comes into the home, rather than CENSORING it at the source, are much 
more practical, easier to administer, and most importantly, do not erode 
our liberties. I support filtering tools for parents, including rating 
systems. 

Most importantly, I feel that parents need to understand that we have a 
responsibility to instill good sense in our children, to sit down with 
them in front of the television and in front of the computer screen, to 
ask them questions, and to answer their questions. Taking that 
responsibility out of the hands of parents is going to further weaken 
the family, and create a censorship bureaucracy that we might later come 
to regret.

I personally paid for an internet and WWW link to my daughter's 6th 
grade classroom. I spoke to the students and told them that there are 
indecent pictures out there on the net, and that I trust that they will 
use this tool responsibly. I said: "If you do anything that you wouldn't 
want your parents to know, then probably you will get caught at it and 
you won't have the Internet in your classroom any more. And there 
probably won't be Internet in any other classrooms around here. But if 
you are responsible pioneers, you will show the other classrooms and 
teachers in this school, and in this school district, that kids and 
teachers can use this new tool. I'm counting on you to be pioneers." 
That's what I told them, and they didn't fail me. If we don't give our 
kids the opportunity to make moral choices, and yes, the chance of 
failing, then how are they going to learn?

LETTERS FROM JENNIE BROWN AND PAT MCGREGOR 

To the Members of the Committee,

I am 15, and a sophmore at Oak Ridge HS in Eldorado Hills, CA. Mom 
showed me how to do things on the net to do research on papers and 
things when I was about 10; I've done papers on the Holocaust, plant 
growth under differing lights, absorbency of paper diapers, Hero 
symbolism in Indiana Jones, Nuclear waste and radiation's affect on the 
body, and looked for clip art to put on papers and charts.

My mom and dad are divorced, and I've used email to keep in touch with 
the one I'm not living with since 4th grade. I also talk to my cousins 
in England every day by email, and some of my aunts and uncles. Email is 
a really good thing.

This year I discovered Mudding, and it's really cool. I've met loads of 
people all over the world and have talked with them and worked with 
them. Mom has always been really firm that I shouldn't tell my phone 
number or address to people on the net, and I don't. It's like not 
giving it to people you meet at the Mall until you know them better. I 
feel like the Net's a pretty safe place if you take care of yourself and 
pay attention to what you're doing.

There's a lot of really cool stuff on the net. Restricting what people 
can put up isn't the way to go: parents and school should do what they 
do now: make rules and agreements, with consequences if you break them.

To the Members of the Committee,

I worried for a long time about letting Jen go "out" mudding by herself, 
but she seems to be paying attention to our basic ground rules and 
keeping herself safe from unwanted attention. I worry when she and her 
friends go out for a day to the local shopping strip, too. ;-) 

Jennie uses the Net like she uses other research tools --and sometimes 
she finds out weird and unusual stuff in the library at school, too. To 
our minds (her parents) the Net is an unparalleled communication tool, 
and it's helped us stay close to Jennie when she's been in the custody 
of one or the other of us.

The computer that Jennie uses is in the living room, and we all talk 
about what we find online. Jennie asked about porn on the net after the 
discussion erupted this spring: we talked about what sort of stuff was 
available and she said, and I quote, "Yuch." 

Parents who set up sensible guidelines and communicate with their 
children are the best filtering technology for the Internet.

LETTER FROM BRAD NEUBERG

To the Members of the Committee,

Howdy. My name is Brad Neuberg. I am 19 and currently live in South 
Texas.

I grew up using bulletin board systems and the internet. As a matter of 
fact, I learned how to read and do mathematics on an old Texas 
Instruments computer! In my high school, the Science Academy of South 
Texas, I communicated with professors, educators, and children from all 
over the world using internet access which my school provided. 
Currently, I use the internet to keep in touch with breaking news, 
congressional legislation using Thomas, and vast discussion groups on 
many different topics. My life has been very enriched due to computers 
and online networks.

Today you will probably hear convincing legislation that the internet is 
full of a massive amount of pornography. You will be told that a recent 
Carnegie Mellon research report, used by Time magazine in an article, 
documents that 85% of the internet is pornography. A large number of 
experts have disputed this article, and have shown, in fact, that there 
is an extremely small amount of pornography available on the internet, 
more around 0.5%.

Some people here today may not truly understand what the internet is. 
One important part of the internet, called newsgroups, is like a huge 
cork bulletin board, such as the bulletin board inside the entrance of a 
common super-market. People with their home computers call up, using 
their telephone line, onto this huge cork bulletin board from all over 
the world, where they can put up messages. So just as at the super-
market I can put up a message saying, "I lost my little dog; if you have 
seen it call 631-2142," someone on the internet can type a message on 
their keyboard and post it to this huge bulletin board, accessible by 
people from all over the world. Now, there can be millions of these huge 
bulletin boards on the internet, so instead of only having one bulletin 
board at the super-market, imagine if there were thousands in the store, 
and each bulletin board had a different topic. Let's say one bulletin 
board at the super-market had a sign on top with the word "Agriculture" 
on it, or another bulletin board with a sign saying "Movies." Well, on 
the "Movies" bulletin board people who are interested in movies could 
post message, or even sounds clips, because one of the special things 
about the internet is that you can post many different kinds of data, 
from text, to voice, to pictures. And so, all over the world, through 
the internet, communities are forming, where people are discussing, 
every imaginable topic, from scientists talking about lasers, to 
kindergarden teachers talking about the techniques they use to teach 
their class. So many people talking is truly a phenomenal thing (well, 
unless it's a talk show :).

There are about ten-thousand of these "cork-bulletin" boards on the 
internet, filled with every imaginable topic, from kids talking about a 
particular video game to Chinese dissidents discussing how to create a 
democracy in China. What the Time magazine article was talking about was 
roughly about 15 of these=7F bulletin boards. These fifteen bulletin 
boards are discussing mostly sexual topics, such as pedophilia or 
homosexuality, and=7F are the "cork boards" where there are a great deal 
of dirty pictures. When the author of the Time magazine article wrote 
that 85% of the internet was filled with dirty pictures, what he=7F was 
really saying was that 85% of the messages on these fifteen sexual 
bulletin boards were actually pornographic pictures. Keep in mind that 
this is 85% of the ten sexual bulletin boards of the ten-thousand 
bulletin boards available on the internet. In other words, a very small 
amount. With other factors included this means that only one-half 
percent of the internet contains pornographic images! This is almost 
like the two dirty books at a library with tens of thousands of books. 

A parent would still like to prevent their children from seeing these 
pictures, even if only 0.5% of the internet contains this pornography. 
In spite of the fact that it actually takes quite complex software to 
see these dirty images, there are already companies who see a need for 
software that can prevent children from seeing the bad 0.5% of the 
internet. These pieces of software scan for dirty words, block access to 
the sexual bulletin boards, record the locations children visit, or use 
other techniques to help parents monitor what their children are doing. 
This software, without government censorship, without government 
control, can help keep children from accessing the bad portions of the 
internet, and allow adults to continue to communicate their thoughts. 

If one of the reasons for the Republican sweep of Congress was to help 
remove government from our lives, and to restore our free-market 
economy, then why should we allow the government to have more control 
over what we say by censoring our thoughts on the internet? We should 
empower parents by letting the free- market provide solutions for the 
pornography problem; let's keep government out of our lives.

Thank you very much,
Brad Neuberg

LETTERS FROM CHRISTOPHER O'CONNELL AND CHRISTINA O'CONNELL 

To the Members of the Committee,

I am a seventeen year old who has been using BBSs, America Online, and 
the Internet for 7 years. It has been an educational and priceless 
experience for me. From the start on local Bulletin Board Systems I have 
made friends and learned skills that will help me when I enter the 
workplace. Because of my experiences online I was able to assist my 
fellow students at my high school with the library's computers and CD-
Rom system. I have learned programming languages, computer skills, and 
played chess with a former Semi-Grand Master. In fact, many of my 
friends are in occupations and areas that I am considering studying in 
college, and much of my interest is due to their support and help. 

And their support went beyond that. During my parents divorce I had them 
to talk to, and it was an immeasurable aid during that trying time. 
During my seven years online, I have never felt anything but safe, and 
have never been made uncomfortable in any way. Sure, there is 
pornography available, but it is just as available in magazine or book 
form to my friends at school who are not online and don't even own 
computers.

Through the online discussion forums, I have been able to discuss 
everything from religion to politics to computers to science fiction to 
poetry. It has given me a chance to speak my mind, develop my thoughts, 
and be heard in a way that most teenagers never have. It has developed 
my thinking and reading skils, and has helped my writing ability in a 
way that no high school english class could hope to match, despite the 
very high quality of the local public school that I attend. I have also 
become a staff-member of one of the online games I frequent, where I am 
learning the value of helping and aiding others. 

All of this has also made me aware of the issues facing our nation 
today. In a day and age when legislators are stressing the value of 
putting religious education, and many other values and moral concerns, 
back in the hands of the family and not the government, why are the same 
legisators proposing to take away a clear right of the parents? The idea 
of laws to censor the Internet ignores not only the first amendment but 
the very basic rights of Americans to govern what their children see and 
raise them as they see fit. My mother, who is a single-parent to my 
sister and myself, has always governed what we see and read. From a 
young age she imposed limits on the amount of television viewing and 
what I was allowed to watch. This has made me an avid reader of books 
who would much rather take in a book of poetry or literature than a 
sitcom any day. This has not made me hate her or get angry, it has 
brought us closer together as a family. All of us spend evenings over 
dinner conversing about our reading, whether it be a science fiction 
book that I am reading, one of my mother's favorite mystery novels, or 
the books on horses that my 9 year old sister, soon to get her own 
Internet account, has begun to read. For that matter, we also spend 
hours discussing what I see on the Internet, ensuring that I understand 
and am not harmed by anything I see. The very idea that this would be 
taken away from us is not only abhorrent and disgusting, but insulting 
to myself, my mother, and every other American family. It says that you 
do not trust parents to do their jobs.

To the Members of the Committee,

I'm the mother of two chidren, a son 17 and a daughter 9. My son has 
been online via BBSs, AOL and the Internet from age 10. We have always 
discussed his time online, what he was doing, who he was talking with. 
His experiences have been overwhelmingly positive - he's had the chance 
to learn chess from a state champion, discuss authors with both friends 
from several online games and the rec.arts.* newsgroups he follows, 
debate politics with people of all ages, learn a new programming 
language, and more. But perhaps most importantly, he has found a genuine 
community of friends online, from many countries, backgrounds and age 
groups who have helped him through some rough times and who he has 
helped in return. 

As a parent, I am very angry at the attempts to censor the Internet in 
the guise of protecting children. I have seen firsthand the value of 
being online in my son's life. On the rare occasions when he has run 
into questionable material, he has not suddenly lost his good sense nor 
the morals he has been raised with -- just as with tv, music, books, we 
discuss things which bother him. Just because material is on the Net, it 
does not somehow magically destroy the relationship we have built nor 
the strong inner sense of right and wrong he has developed over the 
years. And to those who somehow feel that the government must interfere 
here because "parents are too busy" let me just note that I am a 
divorced mother raising my children alone - I work long hours to support 
myself and my children, but that does not stop me from parenting them! 

My daughter has had several internet penpals, an activity which is 
encouraging her writing skills. I have just gotten her her first 
separate net account and she is joining a mail list for young riders. In 
fact, we are planning on using this list in September as part of the 
activities of our local 4H group.

>From my experience, I'd say that the proponents of net censorship 
should 
learn more firsthand about what is available on the Net. I know that 
there is material online which does not fit my morality - but I'm not 
forced to look at it and neither are my children. I know that there are 
some sick people online as well - but there are sick people in my small 
rural town too - I've taught my children to take proper precautions with 
strangers and that teaching stands online or at the local shopping 
center. And while I've seen a lot of scandal-sheet type headlines about 
kids and the net, in over 7 years of experience, as a mother and a net 
reader, I have yet to see anything that remotely reflects those over 
hyped headlines.

LETTER FROM SHARON HENDERSON

To the Members of the Committee,

I felt it was important to tell you about my son, Brian. 

Brian is 12 years old, almost thirteen. When he was a little tot, he was 
diagnosed as neo-autistic: "sort-of, kinda autistic, but not really, so 
we don't know what else to call him." Until he was almost four, he did 
not speak at all--only tears and laughter, with far more laughter. He 
was a bright, responsive baby and toddler, charming, funny, and 
fascinated by technology. When he finally learned to talk, he was 
entirely echolalic for almost three more years--a condition which 
essentially boils down to his ability to repeat back to you, verbatim 
and in your vocal intonation, anything you have said to him. Or anything 
he has heard on TV. Or anything he has heard .... at all. This made him 
a fine mimic--and gave him, as a kind of compensation for his 
disability, a spectacular memory. He may not always pay attention--but 
when he does, you only need to tell him something once. He remembers it 
forever. His language is now age-appropriate--and then some; he 
expresses himself like the learned young man that he is.

His intro to technology came through the family's Atari game system and 
the TV. He comes of a long line of engineers on his Dad's side--folks 
who like to take things apart and put them back together. Computers have 
always fascinated him, and this remains the case to this day. Games, 
programming, email, the WorldWide Web, you name it, he loves it. Other 
people memorize mathematical theorems; Brian memorizes the Gopher and 
FTP sites where he can find information on history, maps, railroad 
trains, collectible card games, and metal gaming miniatures. His peers 
can name all the Power Rangers and their abilities; Brian can tell you 
which Web sites will grant you access to pictures from the American 
Civil War, which ones will tell you about the re- enactment of 
Revolutionary War battles, and where you go to find out the history of 
armored vehicles as used in the armies of the world, since armored 
vehicles existed. 

Does he know there is pornography on the Internet? Sure, he does. He can 
read as well as anyone else. But because he is an American citizen, and 
knows the Constitution better than many of our Congresspeople, he knows 
there is freedom of speech, expression, and pursuit of life, liberty, 
and happiness. He knows these things are (and I'm quoting him, here) 
"ucky, gross stuff for people with little imagination," and he knows how 
to stay away from them. If he did not know how, I would do my parental 
duty and teach him--and I would probably put software on our home 
computer that would keep him from involuntarily running across anything 
my husband and I didn't want him to see.

This child, who uses the local libraries to the hilt, realizes there are 
libraries and archives and universities all over the world to which he 
will probably never get in person. But he knows the Internet can reach 
them, and a lot faster and cheaper than an airplane flight could get him 
to the exact same place. So he comes to work with me on weekends, and 
helps beta-test software by using it. He looks to see what new card 
collectibles there are. He checks stock quotes on his Mom's work benefit 
stock plan. He looks at pictures of old trains. He reads the history of 
the great air, sea and armor battles of WW2. He goes to movie sites and 
checks to see whether "Braveheart" or "First Knight" would be a better 
choice. (he chose "First Knight," because: "Well yeah, the history 
stinks and nobody ever wore stuff like that, but it's got Sean Connery, 
Mom, and he played Indiana Jones' Dad!!") He has recently downloaded 
pictures of parts of England and Germany from which his ancestors came, 
and a really neat map of the Chicago railway transportation system that 
was found online. He has printed out PICTs and JPEGs of US Navy vessels, 
and old British steam trains. Do we supervise his use of the Net? Sure 
we do. That's the kind of parents we are. We try to live our religion 
and our belief in love, democracy, and learning. 

A world has opened up to this terrific, intelligent child who, because 
of lingering bits of his "neo-autism," is shy among people his own age. 
He learns things that he can tell his friends about, and so seem less 
"different" and separate from them. He can sit for hours in front of the 
computer, surfing the 'Net, having a grand exploration for himself--and 
then he goes out to play, excited, happy, his mind engaged in a way that 
television rarely affects him, and delighted to live in such a diverse, 
wonderful world. He lives daily with the InterNet, since I develop 
software for it, and he is a good citizen of the Net because he was 
first a good citizen of his country, and a good Virginia gentleman. Do 
you flame people in email or on the newsgroups, or use bad or nasty 
language? "Nope. That's really tacky manners." Do you mass-mail 
advertisements to newsgroups you've never read? "Uh-uh. That's invasion 
of privacy." Do you look at things your parents don't want you to? "No, 
that would be wrong." So should that stuff be there? "Yes, because not 
everybody likes what I like."

You know what I like?

I like my kid. I like his style. I like his sense of history, his 
understanding of the laws of his democratic country, his tolerance of 
other people, and his love of learning. I like the fact that, when it 
comes my time to face St. Peter, I can do so with a mother's humble 
pride: I can say yessir, my life had one overwhelming worth, besides 
what I was able to accomplish on my own: my husband and myself worked 
together to create, raise, and teach the wonderful, marvelous, honest, 
honorable young Virginia Gentleman and American, Brian Henderson. He 
doesn't misuse the Net, because he doesn't misuse anything else. Good 
rearing, good manners, and proper adult supervision can, after all, 
produce some real, tangible results. I wish people would stop blaming 
the faceless entity known as the Internet, and start looking in their 
own mirrors. I wish the Powers that Be would wake up and realize that 
regulating the Internet won't change a single, solitary thing--because 
change is only effective when it is learned from home. For too long, we 
have all lived by the credo of "don't do as I do, do as I say." And our 
kids today are far too intelligent to swallow that old dog. If we raise 
them right--if we actually do the things we tell them they should do--
they will be good people who love their country, understand and obey its 
laws, worship the deity of their choice, and behave the way they have 
been taught to, whether they are interacting with their friends at 
school, colleagues at work, or with computer systems all over the world 
on the Internet. 

It's that simple. It always has been. It always will be. 

So the legislatures need to wise up, no? 

Thanks for letting me use your soapbox. Feel free to contact me:

LETTER FROM BETTY HARRIS AND JIM GLOVER

To the Members of the Committee,

We have a 14 year old daughter, and over that last few months have 
encouraged her to use the World Wide Web to explore topics that interest 
her. When Christopher Reeve had his riding accident, we searched the web 
and found a frequently asked questions (FAQ) file on spinal cord 
injuries that contained some excellent information. We also found a 
graphic that illustrated the relationship between level of injury and 
loss of function. The web was also very useful for one of her school 
projects on UFOs where we searched and found information and graphics. 
She has also used the web to find information about her favorite music 
groups. We live in Oklahoma City and have also used the web for keeping 
current on information about the OKC bombing.

We keep hearing via the media how easy it is for children to find 
sexually related images and had discussed this with her (Quotes like 
"Your children probably already have found this information."). We 
discussed this with her and she told us that as a result of our 
conversation, she'd looked for over FOUR hours and had only found the 
Playboy magazine home page. We then initiated a discussion with her 
about how we believe the images she found tended to portray women as 
objects and why we object to this type of thing. Her difficulty in 
finding what she was looking for validates my experience (of six years) 
and my husband's experience (of 5 years) with the internet. Sexually 
related images do not just appear on your computer, you have to 1) know 
what you are looking for, 2) understand how the net is set up and know 
how to use the various tools (FTP, gopher, etc) to find what you are 
looking for and 3) you have to spend time searching. If the child is 
spending this amount of time on the computer, the parent should be aware 
of it and should be participating and guiding the child's efforts in 
healthy directions. It is the parent's place to control their children's 
access to the internet, just as they should in regards to other sources 
of information and entertainment (e.g., books, movies, radio, and 
television).

From what we've read on current legislation designed to address access 
to information on the net, we do NOT support the Communications Decency 
Act, or the Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act. We DO 
support the Leahy study, because we believe that when making decisions 
that could have quite serious ramifications regarding freedom of speech 
on the internet, we need to consider carefully the possible alternatives 
and choose alternatives that provide the best outcomes (protecting 
children) with the fewest adverse effects (more restrictions on freedom 
of speech). Our local internet service providers (ISP) have already 
initiated procedures requiring proof of age (e.g., photo identification) 
prior to allowing access to clearly adult areas such as the adult Usenet 
news groups. We suspect that software developers and service providers 
will be able to come up with creative solutions to restrict children's 
net access to domains that their parents are comfortable with. For us, 
the combination of parental supervision and voluntary ISP cooperation is 
more than adequate to protect our daughter from any potentially adverse 
effects of the internet, while allowing her to reap great benefits from 
the diversity of information and people available on the internet. We 
use the internet, just like we use TV and the other media--we attempt to 
restrict access to age-appropriate content and use these sources to 
initiate discussions of what's right and wrong to help our daughter 
develop her own code of ethics.

Three points are all I would like to make: 


Point 1.

We have the technology to bring Millions of books to Billions of people, 
so let's do it! Even if we have to put them behind a computer 
"firewall." 


Point 2.

We need Mom & Pop Shops to provide Internet On-Ramp services to the rest 
of the country, besides the large metropolitan areas.


Point 3.

We need Mom & Pop Shops to provide the means to talk to the rest of the 
world, otherwise only those who can hire an expensive code writer can 
have a World Wide Web Page anyone will want to read.


If you put undue regulations on these Information Providers, then you 
will keep these wonderful things from happening, and you will further 
increase the distance between the Information Rich and the Information 
Poor. A rich person will ALWAYS be able to get a copy of Shakespeare's 
"Romeo and Juliet," but the Information Poor won't be able to get it at 
all, unless we make it incredibly easy.

Only 1 1/2 out of 10 people have college degrees, and many of these 
manage to graduate without EVER reading a Shakespeare play. 

I would like to see this country more well read. 

Last year's Adult Literacy Report showed that the division between 
literate and illiterate adults in this country was about 50/50, 53/47, 
to be exact.

I would like to fix this.

Point Number One:

1. We have the technology to bring millions of books to billions of 
people, so  let's do it!


1. Project Gutenberg IS doing it, and HAS BEEN DOING IT 
for 25 Fourth of July's now: the Declaration of Independence was the 
FIRST ELECTRONIC TEXT EVER POSTED ON THE INTERNET, in July of 1971; and 
this month, a World Wide Web Page containing a Hypertext edition of the 
Declaration of Independence marks our 300th Etext on the 25th Fourth of 
July  that has seen Electronic Books on the Internet. Project Gutenberg 
is ALL volunteers, has NO budget, has NEVER received a government grant, 
NOR a grant from any foundation other than computers and programs from 
computer and software companies, NOTHING that would provide for a First 
Amendment lawyer to proofread an entire book every day of the week. 


Point Number Two:

2. We need Mom & Pop Shops to provide Internet On-Ramp services to the 
rest of the country, besides the large metropolitan areas.

2. I have brought you an exhibit of a Mom & Pop shop 
that provides Internet access in the middle of the the Corn Belt: 
Christina Heal is from Shelbyville, Illinois, and has met Senator Simon 
three times. 


Point Number Three:

3. We need Mom & Pop Shops to provide the means to talk to the rest of 
the world, otherwise only those who can hire an expensive code writer 
can have a World Wide Web Page anyone will want to read.


3. I have brought another exhibit of a Mom & Pop shop, 
Jolea Sampolesi is from Arkansas, and is now in Illinois, making Web 
Sites,  public and private. She has met President Clinton a number of 
times, and it is she and her husband, Steve Weintz, who made the 
Declaration of Independence Web Page. 


On the first point:

Here is the first hard drive disk-pack we ever used in Project 
Gutenberg, it did  not have enough space to hold EITHER the Bible OR 
Shakespeare, and the multi-million dollar computer we used had only two 
of these; so the concept of putting BOTH the Bible AND Shakespeare on 
the Internet sounded totally out of reach in 1971. 

Only half as long ago, in 1983, the size of most hard drives had only 
doubled, and your $10,000 XT computer came with only a 10 megabyte hard 
drive, STILL not enough to hold BOTH Shakespeare and the Bible. 

Yet, this much smaller, and much less costly hard drive will hold 1,000 
books the size of Shakespeare or the Bible, and as this trend continues, 
which it is, we will have a drive that will hold A MILLION books in only 
another 10 years. 

That amount of storage is called a Terabyte, and equals one trillion 
characters of text.

This is what a terabyte looks like now >> 

Here is a stack of 1984 style CDROMs, enough of them to hold ONE MILLION 
books, each with 300 pages full of text. This stack is as tall as some 
of the people in this room. 

The new style CDROMs hold about 6 times as much and thus a stack of 
these less than a foot tall will still hold a million books; you could 
put them all in your brief case. 

Yet, we will NEVER find a MILLION books that EVERYONE is going to agree 
on, because even the greatest books listed in the Britannica Great Books 
Series have been censored: from Socrates, to Plato, to Aristotle; and 
from Chaucer, to Milton, to Shakespeare; just one call to University of 
Illinois reference librarians revealed that ALL of these authors have 
been censored and banned, and more of them in THIS century than you 
would imagine.


On the second point:

There are about 500 million computers in the world, with perhaps an 
average of two people using each one, totalling about 1 Billion computer 
users in the world. Yet only about 5 million of these computers are on 
the the Internet.that is ONE PERCENT.

Even counting PEOPLE and not computers, the total number of people 
subscribed to CompuServe, America OnLine and Prodigy, is still only a 
fraction of 1% of the total number of people using computers.

We NEED these little Mom & Pop Internet On Ramps. 

Nobody else is going to bring On Ramps into the corn fields. 


On the third point:

The Information Superhighway MUST BE A TWO WAY STREET. 

Everyone should be able to speak.

The World Wide Web is currently the way to be heard on the Internet, but 
less than 1% of the 1% of the computer users who ARE on the Internet, 
would have ANY IDEA HOW to put their ideas on a World Wide Web 
Home Page. 

Jolea Sampolesi and her husband, Steve Weintz, have made personal Web 
Pages a reality for the masses, but they, and Christina Heal, cannot 
possibly stay in business, which they are just barely doing now, if they 
have to police all the content of their hardware and software for an 
indecency that is so ill-defined that Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet 
could be labeled as child pornography, simply because they were 15 years 
old in an era when that made them middle-aged, as the life expectancy 
was much shorter than it is today. 

Can we really expect to rewrite history and not to lose it at the same 
time.

The phone companies don't have to monitor for content, the corner 
grocery is not liable for what you pin up on their bulletin board, and 
none of these  Mom & Pop Shops can afford to have a First Amendment 
lawyer read over everything that is posted.

Project Gutenberg publishes an Electronic Text every other day, and half 
our effort is spent doing copyright searches. If we have to spend the 
other half reading for what anyone, anywhere, might deem "indecent" we 
will never have time to achieve our goal of putting 10,000 books on the 
Internet by the end of the year 2001.


Our company designs, constructs and maintains Web sites for a wide range 
of clients, from Fortune 500 corporations to small local firms and even 
individuals. As a small business ourselves, we are not in a position to 
turn away business, nor can we afford to accept liability for creating 
an image,  sound, movie or body of text in accordance with a client's 
specifications. Were we to incur the liabilities set forth in S892 the 
costs of legal defense alone would bankrupt us. It is my opinion that 
the cost of my freedom of speech could easily cost me my livelihood. 

I would like to point out that our clientele and audience are global. 
Therefore, how are the Japanese or British definitions of obscenity, for 
example, to be reconciled with the intent of this bill? Why should our 
foreign clients use the services of a U.S. company, however talented, 
when that firm might be subject to irrelevant restrictions on its 
activities? American Internet content providers could wind up at a 
significant competitive disadvantage, and our dominance of the field 
could go the way of our leads in other fields.

This bill has potentially dreadful long-term effects. By subjecting an 
entire nascent industry to the discipline of an arbitrary and culture-
bound standard, that of decency, we risk crushing the richest 
entrepreneurial arena of our times.

STATEMENT OF U.S. SENATOR RUSS FEINGOLD

JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HEARING ON
CYBERPORN AND CHILDREN: THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM, THE STATE 
OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE NEED FOR CONGRESSIONAL ACTION 

July 24, 1995

The issue we are discussing today is of great concern to me, not simply 
because I am a member of this Committee, but because I am a parent who 
is concerned about the welfare of my children as they use the Internet. 
I am also a parent who is enthusiastic about the positive changes and 
opportunities new forms of communications technology can offer to my 
children.

Interactive computer networks have clearly changed the way Americans, 
and indeed people throughout the world, communicate with one another. 
While individuals carry on conversations in cyberspace much like they do 
over traditional telephones, the use of the Internet goes far beyond 
that characteristic.

* On the Internet, one can act as a publisher and a writer 
  simultaneously by posting their works on various bulletin boards, 
   newsgroups, and on a World Wide Web page.

* One can search out just about any information they wish without 
  leaving their home. Students can access books and other research 
  materials simply by sitting at a personal computer properly outfitted 
  for Internet access. There is a wide range of literature available 
  through the Internet, and with efforts such as Project Guttenberg, 
  which we'll learn more about today, there will soon be many more books 
  available on-line. 

* Individuals can participate in political, academic and scientific 
  forums without being an expert in a particular field. 

* Entrepreneurs can market and sell their products simply by 
  establishing their own home page on the World Wide Web. 

* And now, people throughout the United States will be able to 
  participate in Senate Committee hearings through the Internet. 
  Committees will not be limited to hearing the comments and opinions of 
  those who are part of more organized coalitions and who can afford to 
  make the trip to Washington D.C. The U.S. Senate, more than ever 
  before, has the opportunity to have true grass roots participation in 
  the political process through the Internet. That is an incredibly 
  positive development for this country and emphasizes the potential of 
  decentralized interactive communications networks.

In short, this new world of communications is virtually open to anyone 
with access to a computer with a modem and an Internet connection and 
who is also willing to take a little time to learn how to retrieve all 
the types of information out there.

In fact, there are a number of discussion groups on the Internet 
debating the very issue we are addressing today in this hearing. Those 
on-line debates are very heated, but they provide a positive outlet for 
the exchange of ideas.

While it is doubtful that, at least in the near term, interactive 
computer networks will completely replace more traditional forms of 
communications, it is clear that they have found at a minimum a lasting 
place within our society. The potential of this technology is virtually 
without bound.

However, with these new opportunities come new challenges -- the most 
important of those protecting our children as they use the Internet to 
communicate with others. As tragic as it may be, there are those in this 
country who will try to harm our children, either for profit for even 
more perverse reasons. Unfortunately those individuals, who prey off the 
vulnerability and innocence of children will use whatever means they can 
to commit their crimes, including communications technologies. 

In trying to protect our children, we must recognize the Internet for 
what it is, simply a new way of communicating. My concern in recent 
months, as I have participated in this debate, is that the discussion 
has become so sensationalized that we may fail to react appropriately in 
areas where on- line dangers actually exist. I don't want to see this 
Congress respond to existing problems by creating new legal and 
constitutional dilemmas. 

That is what I believe happened when we passed telecommunications 
legislation last month. Members of the Senate reacted as any parent 
would when they were confronted with the "blue binder" filled with 
pornography downloaded from the Internet. What members weren't told was 
where the graphics and text came from --whether from public on-line chat 
groups or for-pay adult bulletin boards -- and how difficult they were 
to access. Senators reacted as most of us would in that situation, they 
voted for an amendment they thought penalized pornographers and sexual 
predators and which purported to protect children. 

In my opinion, that legislation duplicated existing prohibitions for on-
line obscenity and created new restrictions on speech which is protected 
by the First Amendment.

In a well-intentioned attempt to protect children, we trampled on one of 
the most fundamental rights we have in this country -- to speak freely 
and without reservation independent of prevailing views of what is 
offensive and unconstrained by a frequently changing political 
environment.

I am concerned that the Senate will take further legislative steps that 
will stifle the growth of interactive communications technology and 
ultimately censor communications on the Internet while not truly solving 
the problem.

I think we need to look very carefully at the following questions: 

Where do the fundamental problems exist with abuse of the Internet --on 
newsgroups, on for-pay bulletin boards, within electronic mail, or 
elsewhere?

What is the nature of the problem -- sexual predation, obscenity, 
pornography, indecency, profanity, or harassment? 

What laws -- federal, state and local -- exist currently to address 
those problems?

And finally, where do those laws fall short of protecting our children? 

It is incumbent upon Congress to restore some rationality to the debate 
by trying to answer these questions. In addition, those participating in 
this debate need to stop using terms with very different meanings 
interchangeably, such as obscenity, pornography and indecency. We must 
learn how interactive communications systems differ structurally from 
existing types of communications technologies as well as how they are 
similar. Supreme Court decisions on content regulation and the First 
Amendment have always weighed heavily on the nature of the medium in 
question.

Hopefully, we will have some of these questioned answered in today's 
hearing. However, I want to caution my colleagues that one hearing alone 
cannot adequately address the complexities of this issue nor will it 
lead us to the proper solution without further study. 

I strongly urge my colleagues to exercise caution and restraint when 
considering legislative attempts to regulate free speech. We must look 
for solutions that empower parents to exercise more control over the 
types of information their children receive over computer networks. 
Free- market remedies, where they are possible, are almost always 
preferable to heavy handed content regulation and criminal penalties 
imposed by the federal government.

I look forward to learning more about all of these issues from our 
witnesses, and I thank them from participating in this hearing.

<title>Testimony of Donnelle Gruff</title>
<body>
<pre>

I was logged on a bbs [bulletin board service] called "the zoo" and Bill 
logged on and came into the teleconference and told everyone he had a 
bbs that was free and instructed everyone to call it a gave us the 
number to call. I logged on to Bill's bbs "Beyond the Sound Barrier" and 
at this time was required to give him my name and address. After doing 
this I logged on with my usual handle "She Devil" and for the first 
couple of days he seemed really nice. He welcomed me to his bbs and tome 
me to look around at what the channel had to offer. The next day he 
asked me if I would be co-sysop and watch over the teleconference when 
more phone lines were installed. I said yes. and then after a couple of 
days he started asking me personal questions such as "do I shave besides 
my legs, "what bra size do I wear", would I go out with him", and " 
would I blow him". When I would not answer, he kept asking me so I 
logged off and went o the other bbs "the Zoo".

He followed me to that channel and logged on and kept telling me he was 
going to come to my house. After telling him 20 times not to come over 
he finally agreed and I though that was the end of it. That night at 
about 1:30 a.m., three days after I became co-sysop, he came over and I 
told him not to come back again. It said "it's late and he was going to 
have to leave" and he did as I asked. The next day he came to my house 
and sat outside for four hours and my mother was forced to call the 
police and then he left. The next day he came back and sat outside my 
house again and when I went to the front window to see what the dog was 
barking at, he saw me and left. That Saturday I went to the bowling 
alley to meet a few friends and he followed me around all night but 
didn't say anything to me.

A couple of days later when I logged on to this bbs he emulated me and 
took me to some pornographic pictures [emulate is a term that refers to 
using a computer at a remote location to act as though it were my 
computer, in so doing, the remote user can "appear" to others in the 
cyber world as though he is me. This is a procedure which, with certain 
software, can be done with out my permission, and sometimes, without my 
knowledge]. When he did that he I had no way of getting out of them and 
I turned my computer off. The next time I logged on his bbs he attempted 
to down load pornographic pictures to me but was having trouble doing 
it. He allowed me to download one to myself and I did so I could give 
one to the detective. I have not called his bbs since then.

<title>Statement of Senator Leay (D-VT)</title>

<pre>

STATEMENT OF SENATOR LEAHY AT HEARING ON CYBERPORN AND CHILDREN: THE 
SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM, THE STATE OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE NEED FOR 
CONGRESSIONAL ACTION 
July 24, 1995

This is the very first congressional hearing held on the issue of 
regulating indecent and obscene material on the Internet and the problem 
of children's access to objectionable online material. That is correct, 
the first.

In spite of the action taken by the Senate Commerce Committee when it 
added the Communications Decency Act to its telecommunications bills 
last year and this, they held no investigative or legislative hearings 
into this important and complex matter. Indeed, when the Senate passed a 
restrictive version of the Exon-Coats Communications Decency Act on June 
14, over my objection and those of Senator Feingold, it did so without 
the benefit of hearings or anything approaching a thorough examination 
of the matter. I am old-fashioned enough to remember when we used to 
hold hearings first and pass legislation after--after we got the facts, 
had analyzed the problem and had worked with the Administration and the 
public to craft a legislative solution to the public's legitimate 
concerns.

With all the magazine articles, talk show babble, and furor that has 
surrounded this issue, I am glad the Judiciary Committee is holding this 
hearing in order to begin to set the record straight. I want to commend 
Chairman Hatch and Senator Grassley for convening this hearing and look 
forward to the testimony of our witnesses this afternoon. These are 
issues that greatly concern me: the future of the Internet; the best 
ways for parents to control their children's access to the Internet and 
to protect against inappropriate and offense materials; the appropriate 
role of law enforcement.

I had asked the Attorney General of the United States as well as a 
coalition of private and public interest groups known as the Interactive 
Working Group to look at these issues and provide recommendations on 
addressing the problem of children's access to objectionable online 
material in a constitutional and effective manner. I look forward to 
receiving the report of the Department of Justice as promptly as their 
study can be concluded.

Today the Interactive Working Group is releasing its report describing 
some of the technology available today to help parents supervise their 
children's activities on the Internet and protect them from 
objectionable online material. Some of this technology was demonstrated 
last week in a meeting hosted by Representative Cox, who will testify 
here today.

We are finding that software entrepreneurs and the vibrant forces of the 
free market are providing tools that can empower parents' to restrict 
their children's access to offensive material. We can address the 
problem of online pornography by empowering parents, and not the 
government, to screen children's computer activities. This is the best 
way to police the Internet without unduly restricting free speech or 
squelching the growth of this fantastic new communications medium. 

It is parents, not the government, who should decide what restrictions 
to place on their children's access to that which they consider 
objectionable: whether it is beer advertising, or fantastic card games 
that some parents believe promotes interest in the occult. Available 
blocking technology can make pornographic Usenet news groups or World 
Wide Web sites off-limits to children. Other commercially available 
products limit children's access to chat rooms, where they might be 
solicited, and limit children's ability to receive pornographic pictures 
through electronic mail. Yet other products allow parents to monitor 
their children's usage of the Internet. Interested organizations, like 
the Christian Coalition or Mothers against Drunk Driving, could provide 
parents that use blocking technology with lists of sites these groups 
consider inappropriate for children. 

On the other hand, government regulation will stifle this new industry. 
The Internet has been growing at an exponential rate and new uses for it 
are devised daily. Overly restrictive bans against indecency on the 
Internet will prove not only unconstitutional but will also hamper the 
growth of this new communications medium. 

The Internet does not function like a broadcast or a newspaper where a 
station manager or editor chooses which images or stories to send out in 
public. The Internet is like a combination of a great library and town 
square, where people can make available vast amounts of information or 
take part in free and open discussions on any topic. 

It has provided great opportunities for our disabled citizens and has 
enabled our children the ability to discuss issues with some of 
society's greatest minds. With this technology, I conduct electronic 
town meetings with Vermonters, post information about legislative 
activities, and hear back from Vermonters about what they think. 

To impose the government regulation of broadcasters to the Internet is 
inappropriate. Anyone with a computer and a modem can send something out 
on the Internet, but unlike a broadcaster, potential listeners must seek 
out this information and download it. 

Any legislative approach must take into consideration online users' 
privacy and free speech interests. If we grant too much power to online 
providers to screen for indecent material, public discourse and online 
content in cyberspace will be controlled by the providers and not the 
users of this fantastic resource. On the other hand, we want our laws 
should encourage and not discourage online providers from creating a 
safe environment for children.

Even worse would be discouraging online providers from allowing children 
onto their services altogether. If online providers are liable for any 
exposure of indecent material to children, people under the age of 
eighteen will be shut out of this technology or relegated by the 
government to sanitized "kids only" services that contain only a tiny 
fraction of the entire Internet. That would be the equivalent of 
limiting today's students to the childhood section of the library or 
locking them out completely. This is not how this country should face 
the increasingly competitive global marketplace of the 21st century. 

What are we doing if we discourage the Project Gutenberg from placing 
online the works of Charles Dickens, Geoffrey Chaucer or D.H. Lawrence 
for fear of prosecution because someone, somewhere on the Internet, 
might find the works indecent? Would the Internet still be the great 
electronic library and setting for open discussion it now promises? 

Parents know their children better than any government official, and are 
in the best position to know the sort of online material to which their 
children may be exposed.

Finally, we must recognize that existing laws and what they provide by 
way of protection. Our criminal laws already prohibit the sale or 
distribution over computer networks of obscene material. We already 
impose criminal liability for transmitting any threatening message over 
computer networks. We already proscribe the solicitation of minors over 
computers for any sexual activity, and illegal luring of minors into 
sexual activity through computer conversations. Indeed, a only a few 
months ago under Senator Grassley's leadership we increased the 
penalties for many of these offenses. We need to work with law 
enforcement to make sure they have the resources and training to track 
down computer criminals. 

I look forward to working with all members of the Committee as we move 
forward on these important matters.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

Federal Bureau of Investigation

 
Implementation of the Communications Assistance for Law 
Enforcement Act

AGENCY: Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

ACTION: Initial notice and requests for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FBI is providing initial notification of law enforcement 
capacity requirements as mandated in section 104 of the Communications 
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. Comments regarding this initial 
notice will be considered in the development of the final capacity 
notice.

DATES: Written comments must be received on or before November 15, 
1995.

ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted in triplicate to the 
Telecommunications Industry Liaison Unit (TILU), Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, P.O. Box 220450, Chantilly, VA 22022-0450.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:
Contact TILU at (800) 551-0336. Please refer to your question as a 
capacity notice question.

I. Background

    On October 25, 1994, the President signed into law the 
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) (Public Law 
103-414; 47 U.S.C. 1001-1010). This law presents law enforcement's 
requirements for the surveillance of wire or electronic communications. 
The primary purpose of the CALEA is to clarify a telecommunications 
carrier's duty to assist law enforcement agencies with the lawful 
interception of communications and the acquisition of call-identifying 
information in an ever-changing telecommunications environment. To 
ensure that law enforcement agencies can continue to conduct authorized 
surveillance of wire or electronic communications, the CALEA states 
that telecommunications carriers must meet the assistance capability 
requirements set forth in section 103 of the Act (and restated in 
Appendix A of this notice).
    Section 104 of the CALEA mandates that the Attorney General of the 
United States provide notice of estimates for the actual and maximum 
number of pen register, trap and trace, and communication intercepts 
that law enforcement agencies may conduct and use simultaneously.
    The definitions for ``actual capacity'' and ``maximum capacity'' 
are included below:
    Actual Capacity--``notice of the actual number of communication 
interceptions. pen registers, and trap and trace devices, representing 
a portion of the maximum capacity that the Attorney General estimates 
that government agencies authorized to conduct electronic surveillance 
may conduct and use simultaneously by the date that is 4 years after 
the date of enactment of the CALEA'' (CALEA, section 104(a)(1)(A)).
    Maximum Capacity--``notice of the maximum capacity required to 
accommodate all of the communication interceptions, pen registers, and 
trap and trace devices that the Attorney General estimates that 
government agencies authorized to conduct electronic surveillance may 
conduct and use simultaneously after the date that is 

[[Page 53644]]
4 years after of enactment of the CALEA'' (CALEA, section 
104(a)(1)(B)).
    This Federal Register announcement serves as the initial notice of 
the government's actual and maximum capacity requirements. These 
requirements will aid telecommunications carriers in developing and 
deploying solutions to meet the assistance capability requirements set 
forth in section 103 of the CALEA. A final notice will be issued in 
accordance with the CALEA requirements after considering comments to 
this initial notice.
    The actual and maximum capacity requirements were developed by the 
FBI in coordination with law enforcement. By order of the Attorney 
General of the United States, as codified in 28 CFR 0.85 (o), 
government implementation responsibilities under the CALEA were 
delegated to the FBI. The FBI, in turn, is establishing TILU to carry 
out the government's implementation responsibilities, including the 
publication of capacity notices.
    For the purposes of this document, the terms defined in section 
2510 of title 18, United States Code, and section 102 of the CALEA 
(section 1001 of title 47, United States Code) have, respectively, the 
meanings stated in those sections. Additional clarification of terms is 
provided in Appendix B of this notice.

II. Introduction

    The capacity figures in this notice reflect the combined number of 
simultaneous pen register, trap and trace, and communication 
interceptions that law enforcement may conduct by October 25, 1998. All 
telecommunications carriers must, within 3 years after the publication 
of the final notice of capacity requirements or within 4 years after 
the date of enactment of the CALEA, whichever is longer, ensure that 
their systems are capable of accommodating simultaneously the number of 
pen register, trap and trace, and communication interceptions 
identified in the actual capacity requirements. Furthermore, all 
telecommunications carriers shall ensure capabilities exist to 
expeditiously accommodate any increase in the actual number of pen 
register, trap and trace, and communication interceptions that 
authorized agencies may seek to conduct and use, up to the maximum 
capacity requirement. Some carriers may not need to make modifications 
to their equipment, facilities, and services in response to this notice 
because they currently meet all law enforcement capacity and capability 
requirements for electronic surveillance.
    The capacity requirements are not intended to specify, required or 
prohibit adoption of any particular system design or configuration by a 
telecommunications carrier, equipment manufacturer, or support services 
provider. These entities must develop an appropriate solution to comply 
with the capacity requirements set forth in this notice and with the 
assistance capability requirements found in section 103 of the CALEA. 
In developing solutions, carriers should consider the effect that 
particular services and features may have on capacity requirements. For 
example, the required number of ports, lines, or other network 
resources may vary depending upon the use of particular services and 
features by an intercept subject. The FBI, along with other law 
enforcement agencies, will be available, through the consultative 
process, to discuss these engineering issues.
    In accordance with the intent of the CALEA, carriers must ensure 
that their equipment, facilities, or services that provide a customer 
or subscriber with the ability to originate, terminate, or direct 
communications are capable of meeting the capability and capacity 
requirements mandated by the CALEA. These requirements apply to 
existing and future telecommunications carriers.

III. Capacity Requirements Derivation

    The capacity figures that are presented in this initial notice were 
derived as a result of a thorough analysis of electronic surveillance 
needs. Information regarding electronic surveillance activities for a 
specific time period was obtained from telecommunications carriers, law 
enforcement, U.S. District Courts, State Courts, State Attorneys 
General, and State District Attorneys to establish a historical 
baseline of activity.
    The historical baseline of electronic surveillance activity was 
determined after examination of both the location and occurrence of 
each electronic surveillance reported. The historical baseline was then 
analyzed to derive the total and simultaneous electronic surveillance 
activity by switch and within specific geographic areas. Future 
capacity needs were then determined after consideration of the impact 
of demographics, market trends, and other factors on the historical 
baseline.
    The analysis indicates that electronic surveillance activity varies 
by geographic area. Therefore, the capacity requirements will vary by 
geographic area. The capacity requirements are reported by category, 
with each geographic area being assigned to one of three distinct 
categories. The use of categories enables capacity requirements to be 
stated in a manner that reasonably represents law enforcement 
electronic surveillance needs in all geographic areas, yet does not 
overburden the telecommunications industry by holding all carriers to 
the same level of capacity.
    Category I (the highest category) and Category II (the intermediate 
category) represent those geographic areas where the majority of 
electronic surveillance activity occurs. Only a few of the most densely 
populated areas, which have historically been areas of high electronic 
surveillance activity, are grouped into Category I. Other densely 
populated areas and some suburban areas, with moderate electronic 
surveillance activity, are grouped into Category II. The numbers for 
these categories were derived based on the analysis described above. 
Category I and Category II apply to approximately 25 percent of the 
equipment, facilities, and services covered by the survey over the time 
period.
    Category III (the lowest category) represents law enforcement's 
minimum acceptable capacity requirements for electronic surveillance 
activity. This category covers all other geographic areas. The numbers 
for Category III were derived by analyzing areas of historically low 
electronic surveillance activity and projecting future needs in order 
to establish a requirement for a minimum level of capacity for 
electronic surveillance.
    All telecommunications carriers are expected to meet the minimum 
capacity requirements of Category III. Carriers will be individually 
notified of those specific geographic areas within the areas they serve 
that exceed Category III and warrant a Category I or Category II 
capacity requirement. The individual carrier notifications will occur 
contemporaneously with the publication of the final notice. It is 
anticipated that the majority of the area served by a carrier will fall 
into Category III; however, if Category I and Category II capacity 
requirements are necessary, they are likely to affect only a small 
portion of their area served.
    This initial capacity notice includes the actual and maximum 
capacity requirements for Categories I, II, and III. After considering 
comments to this initial notice, a final notice will be published. 
Future changes to the maximum capacity requirements issued in the final 
notice will be published in the Federal Register, as necessary, in 
accordance with section 104(c). 

[[Page 53645]]


IV. Initial Statement of Actual and Maximum Capacity

    The actual and maximum capacity requirements are presented as a 
percentage of the engineered capacity of the equipment, facilities, and 
services that provide a customer or subscriber with the ability to 
originate, terminate, or direct communications. Engineered capacity 
refers to the maximum number of subscribers that can be served by that 
equipment, facility, or service. Frequently, the percentage is applied 
to the engineered subscriber capacity of a switch, however, the 
percentage can also apply to nonswitch equipment (i.e., network 
peripherals) involved in the origination, termination, or direction of 
communications. Percentages are being used rather than fixed numbers 
due to the dynamics and diversity of the telecommunications industry. 
The use of percentages allows telecommunications carriers the 
flexibility to adjust to changes in marketplace conditions or changes 
in the number of subscribers, access lines, equipment, facilities, 
etc., and still know the required level of capacity.
    As a result of extensive consultation with federal, State, and 
local law enforcement agencies, telecommunications carriers, providers 
of telecommunications support services, and manufacturers of 
telecommunications equipment, the FBI proposes the following capacity 
requirements for Categories I, II, and III:

Category I

Actual Capacity
    Each telecommunications carrier must provide the ability to meet 
the capability assistance requirements defined in section 103 of the 
CALEA for a number of simultaneous pen register, trap and trace, and 
communication interceptions equal to 0.5% of the engineered capacity of 
the equipment, facilities, or services that provide a customer or 
subscriber with the ability to originate, terminate, or direct 
communications.
Maximum Capacity
    Each telecommunications carrier must ensure that it can 
expeditiously increase its capacity to meet the assistance capability 
requirements defined in section 103 of the CALEA for a number of 
simultaneous pen register, trap and trace, and communication 
interceptions equal to 1% of the engineered capacity of the equipment, 
facilities, or services that provide a customer or subscriber with the 
ability to originate, terminate, or direct communications.

Category II

Actual Capacity
    Each telecommunications carrier must provide the ability to meet 
the capability assistance requirements defined in section 103 of the 
CALEA for a number of simultaneous pen register, trap and trace, and 
communication interceptions equal to 0.25% of the engineered capacity 
of the equipment, facilities, or services that provide a customer or 
subscriber with the ability to originate, terminate, or direct 
communications.
Maximum Capacity
    Each telecommunications carrier must ensure that it can 
expeditiously increase its capacity to meet the assistance capacity 
requirements defined in section 103 of the CALEA for a number of 
simultaneous pen register, trap and trace, and communication 
interceptions equal to 0.5% of the engineered capacity of the 
equipment, facilities, or services that provide a customer or 
subscriber with the ability to originate, terminate, or direct 
communications.

Category III

Actual Capacity
    Each telecommunications carrier must provide the ability to meet 
the capability assistance requirements defined in section 103 of the 
CALEA for a number of simultaneous pen register, trap and trace, and 
communication interceptions equal to 0.05% of the engineered capacity 
of the equipment, facilities, or services that provide a customer or 
subscriber with the ability to originate, terminate, or direct 
communications.
Maximum Capacity
    Each telecommunications carrier must ensure that it can 
expeditiously increase its capacity to meet the assistance capability 
requirements defined in section 103 of the CALEA for a number of 
simultaneous pen register, trap and trace, and communication 
interceptions equal to 0.25% of the engineered capacity of the 
equipment, facilities, or services that provide a customer or 
subscriber with the ability to originate, terminate, or direct 
communications.
    When translated from percentages to numbers, capacity requirements 
should be rounded up to the nearest whole number.

V. Carrier Statements and Consultation

    As set forth in section 104(d) of the CALEA, each 
telecommunications carrier is required to provide within 180 days after 
publication of the final capacity notice a statement identifying any of 
its systems or services that do not have the capacity to meet the 
assistance capability requirements stated in section 103 of the CALEA. 
These carrier statements will be used in conjunction with law 
enforcement priorities and other factors to determine the specific 
equipment, facilities, and services that require immediate modification 
and that may be eligible for cost reimbursement. The FBI will consult 
with telecommunications carriers to establish a template for responding 
to the capability and capacity requirements.

Appendix A--CALEA, Sec. 103 (Pub. L. 103-414; 47 U.S.C. 1002) 
Assistance Capability Requirements

    (a) Capability Requirements.--Except as provided in subsections 
(b), (c), and (d) of this section and sections 108(a) and 109(b) and 
(d), a telecommunications carrier shall ensure that its equipment, 
facilities, or services that provide a customer or subscriber with 
the ability to originate, terminate, or direct communications are 
capable of--
    (1) expeditiously isolating and enabling the government, 
pursuant to a court order or other lawful authorization, to 
intercept, to the exclusion of any other communications, all wire 
and electronic communications carried by the carrier within a 
service area to or from equipment, facilities, or services of a 
subscriber of such carrier concurrently with their transmission to 
or from the subscriber's equipment, facility, or service, or at such 
later time as may be acceptable to the government;
    (2) expeditiously isolating and enabling the government, 
pursuant to a court order or other lawful authorization, to access 
call-identifying information that is reasonably available to the 
carrier--
    (A) before, during, or immediately after the transmission of a 
wire or electronic communication (or at such later time as may be 
acceptable to the government); and
    (B) in a manner that allows it to be associated with the 
communication to which it pertains, except that, with regard to 
information acquired solely pursuant to the authority for pen 
registers and trap and trace devices (as defined in section 3127 of 
title 18, United States Code), such call-identifying information 
shall not include any information that may disclose the physical 
location of the subscriber (except to the extent that the location 
may be determined from the telephone number);
    (3) delivering intercepted communications and call-identifying 
information to the government, pursuant to a court order or other 
lawful authorization, in a format such that they may be transmitted 
by means of equipment, facilities, or services procured by the 
government to a location other than the premises of the carrier; and
    (4) facilitating authorized communications interceptions and 
access to call-identifying information unobtrusively and with a 
minimum of interference with any subscriber's telecommunications 
service and in a manner that protects--

[[Page 53646]]

    (A) the privacy and security of communications and call-
identifying information not authorized to be intercepted; and
    (B) information regarding the government's interception of 
communications and access to call-identifying information.
    (b) Limitations.--
    (1) Design of Features and Systems Configurations.--This title 
does not authorize any law enforcement agency or officer--
    (A) to require any specific design of equipment, facilities, 
services, features, or system configurations to be adopted by any 
provide of a wire or electronic communication service, any 
manufacturer of telecommunications equipment, or any provider of 
telecommunications support services; or
    (B) to prohibit the adoption of any equipment, facility, 
service, or feature by any provider of a wire or electronic 
communication service, any manufacturer of telecommunications 
equipment, or any provider of telecommunications support services.
    (2) Information Services; Private Networks and Interconnection 
Services and Facilities.--The requirements of subsection (a) do not 
apply to--
    (A) information services; or
    (B) equipment, facilities, or services that support the 
transport or switching of communications for private networks or for 
the sole purpose of interconnecting telecommunications carriers.
    (3) Excryption.--A telecommunications carrier shall not be 
responsible for decryping, or ensuring the government's ability to 
decrypt, any communication encrypted by a subscriber or customer, 
unless the encryption was provided by the carrier and the carrier 
possesses the information necessary to decrypt the communication.
    (c) Emergency or Exigent Circumstances.--In emergency or exigent 
circumstances (including those described in sections 2518 (7) or 
(11)(b) and 3125 of title 18, United States Code, and section 
1805(e) of title 50 of such Code), a carrier at its discretion may 
comply with subsection (a)(3) by allowing monitoring at its premises 
if that is the only means of accomplishing the interception or 
access.
    (d) Mobile Service Assistance Requirements.--A 
telecommunications carrier that is a provider of commercial mobile 
service (as defined in section 332(d) of the Communications Act of 
1934) offering a feature or service that allows subscribers to 
redirect, hand off, or assign their wire or electronic 
communications to another service area or another service provider 
or to utilize facilities in another service area or of another 
service provider shall ensure that, when the carrier that had been 
providing assistance for the interception of wire or electronic 
communications or access to call-identifying information pursuant to 
a court order or lawful authorization no longer has access to the 
content of such communications or call-identifying information 
within the service area in which interception has been occurring as 
a result of the subscriber's use of such a feature or service, 
information is made available to the government (before, during, or 
immediately after the transfer of such communications) identifying 
the provider of a wire or electronic communication service that has 
acquired access to the communications.

Appendix B--Glossary

    Communication Interceptions--Regarding a wire or an electronic 
communication, communication interceptions include any information 
concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of that communication. 
Communication interceptions apply to any type of wire or electronic 
communications (i.e., any transfer of signs, signals, writing, 
images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature).
    Call-Identifying Information--Dialing or signaling information 
that identifies the origin, direction, destination, or termination 
of each communication generated or received by a subscriber by means 
of any equipment, facility, or service of a telecommunications 
carrier. (See Pub. L. 103-414, Section 102(2))
    Electronic Surveillance--The statutory-based legal 
authorization, process and the associated technological capabilities 
and activities related to communication interceptions and the 
acquisition of call-identifying information as defined above.
    Law Enforcement--Federal, State, and local law enforcement 
agencies.
    Pen Register--A device that records or decodes electronic or 
other impulses that identify the numbers dialed or otherwise 
transmitted on the telephone line to which such device is attached, 
but such term does not include any device used by a provider or 
customer of a wire or electronic communication service for billing, 
or recording as and incident to billing, for communications service 
provided by such provider or any device used by a provider or 
customer of a wire communications service for cost accounting or 
other like purposes in the ordinary course of its business. (18 
U.S.C. 3127(3))
    Telecommunications Carrier--Any person or entity engaged in the 
transmission or switching of wire or electronic communications as a 
common carrier for hire; including as a person or entity engaged in 
providing commercial mobile services (as defined in section 322(d) 
of the Communications Act of 1934) and a person or entity engaged in 
providing wire or electronic communication switching or transmission 
service to the extent that the Federal Communications Commission 
finds that such service is a replacement for a substantial portion 
of the local telephone exchange service and that it is in the public 
interest to deem such a person or entity to be a telecommunications 
carrier for purposes of Title I of the CALEA. The term does not 
include persons or entities insofar as they are engaged in providing 
information services and any class or category of telecommunications 
carriers that the Commission exempts by the rule after consultation 
with the U.S. Attorney General. (See Pub. L. 103-414, Section 
102(8))
    Trap and Trace--A device that captures the incoming electronic 
or other impulses that identify the originating number of an

<TITLE>FBI Director Freeh 11/2 Letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Hyde</TITLE>
</head>
<BODY>
<p>
<p>
November 2, 1995
<P>
Honorable Henry Hyde<BR>
Chairman<BR>
Committee on the Judiciary<BR>
House of Representatives<BR>
Washington, D.C.  20515<P>

Dear Mr. Chairman:<P>

          An article published today in <EM>The New York Times</EM>
states that the "FBI wants advanced system to vastly increase
wiretapping."  That simply is not so.<P> 

          Court-ordered wiretapping is the single most effective
investigative technique used by law enforcement to combat illegal
drugs, terrorism, violent crime, espionage and organized crime. 
The majority of wiretapping is conducted by state and local law
enforcement.  Last year there were 1,154 wiretap court orders
nationwide for all of law enforcement but these court-ordered
wiretaps are critical to saving lives and solving the very worst
crimes suffered by the public.  Moreover, that number is not
expected to increase in any significant manner when the law
already passed by Congress is fully implemented.<P>

          Congress last year overwhelmingly passed legislation to
preserve this ability in the face of advancing technology.  The
law neither expands authority nor ability, it merely maintains
the status quo, that is, only maintains the ability of law
enforcement to conduct court-ordered electronic surveillance. 
Without this, the public safety would be severely jeopardized.<P>


The simple facts are:
<UL>
<LI>Congress last year did not expand the FBI's authority to conduct
wiretaps nor did the FBI ask Congress to do so.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The FBI and the telephone industry are working together -- as the
law Congress passed last year requires -- to find reasonable and affordable
solutions in the face of advancing technology. The initial public request
for comment is part of that process.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>We have not and are not asking for the ability to
               monitor one out of every 100 telephone lines or
               any other ridiculous number like that.  To obtain
               that many court orders and conduct that extent of
               wiretapping would be nearly impossible.  
Information supplied by the FBI was simply applied in
               a manner not intended to reach erroneous
               conclusions.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Without this law, adequate funding and reasonable
               technical solutions, the Nation's public safety
               and national security are unquestionably
               jeopardized.  Merely maintaining without expanding
    the ability of law enforcement to conduct court-ordered wiretaps is the single most important
               problem law enforcement faces today.
</UL>

          The new law requires the FBI, on behalf of all of law
enforcement, to work with the telephone industry to identify
technical design requirements for industry to build into their
systems.  The public notice mentioned in <EM>The Times</EM> article is
part of that process and we are working with the telephone
industry to define workable requirements and reasonable
capacities.<P>

Deputy Attorney General Gorelick said this morning:
"Let me make it perfectly clear, there is no intention to expand
the number of wiretaps or the extent of wiretapping."  Those who
are using the public comment notice to argue to the contrary are
wrong.
<P>
Sincerely yours,
<P>

Louis J. Freeh<BR>
Director

<title>Statement by Sen. Burns upon introduction of S. 1587</title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>
STATEMENT BY SENATOR CONRAD BURNS
RE:  INTRODUCTION OF THE "ENCRYPTION
COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT OF 1996
DATED MARCH 5, 1996


	I believe that one of the biggest concerns that folks have in my home State of 
Montana is the increasing level  of governmental regulation and intrusion into their 
daily lives.  There is no question that this legislation will have a direct impact on 
the federal government's abiliy to monitor folks communications or review their 
personal computer files.  I gotta tell you, I don' know too many people who feel that 
he IRS doesn't have enough power as it is, and the last thing we want to do is give 
the IRS essentially free access to folks tax records.   

	However, my primary interest in offering this legislaion is that it has 
profound and far-reaching impacts on both America's economy and upon individual 
Americans.

	First,  let me talk about the bill's impact upon the American economy.
  
	--  This bill, by eliminating the outdated export restrictions that are 
presently in place, frees up American companies to compete in the global market.   
This will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, it will translate intot $100 billion 
in increased revenues for our country over the next couple of years, and it will 
insure that America will remain the world leader as we make the transition to the 
Global Information Infrasructure.

	--  I've explained these impacts in greater detail in my Statement introducing 
the bill, copies of which are floating around the room.

	Next, and more importantly, I want to focus today upon what this legislation 
means to individual Americans.

	--  Aside from protecting American's personal files and communications from 
unauthorized "hacking." I believe that the most profound impact of this legislation 
will be upon the growth of the Inernet.

	--  For the past seven y ears while I've been doing telecommunications work 
here in Congress, I've watched he Internet flourish.  I see unbelievable opporunity 
for all Americans, both financially and personallly, if we allow the Inernet to 
continue to grow.

	(1)	Folks will be able to use the Internet to conduct banking and other 
financial transactions from their home over the Inernet;

	(2)	They'll be able to purchase an unlimited array of products and services 
directly from their homes;

	(3)	Furthermore, the Net will play a vital role in the development of 
Telemedicine. 

	(4)	The possibilities are endless.  They are bound only by American's 
imagination.


	HOWEVER,  all of these opportunities will be lost if we don't allow companies 
to use adequate encryption capabilities.  We've witnessed over the past couple of 
months examples of this very fact:

	--  There's the case of the doctor in West Virginia who wanted to save his 
patients money  and increase the quality of medical care they receied by putting their 
records on the Internet so that other physicians could review them for consultation 
purposes.  He decided not to do it because the Net didn't have a high enough level of 
security because of these outdated governmental export restrictions to insure that 
these records wouldn't become immediately accessible to the public.

	--  Then there's the case where a couple of Russian students "hacked" into the 
Citibank system and stole several million dollars.  The only way they caught the guy 
is because his girlfriend  turned him in after he broke up with her.

	--  The list goes on and on.

	I believe that this legislation will  allow American companies to develop 
computer technology that will create consumer confidence in the security of 
transmissions over the Internet which will create unlimited opportunity for both 
businesses and the American consumer.

	Finally, this legislation will allow the Telecommunications Bill which we 
recently passed here in Congress to work; without it, I question whether much of our 
work was in vain.

 	--  For example, the Teleco bill allows the cable companies, and utility 
companies to compee against one another to provide a comprehensive package of services 
to the consumer across one line.  Over this line, folks will be able to watch 
television, call their children, access the Internet,  insure that their home is 
protected by an alarm system while they're away, and have utility services.  But if 
this line isn't secure, who's going to want to purchase such a package in the first 
place?

	It is for these reasons that I am pushing forward with this legislation.  I 
believe that it will not only take  the handcuffs off our American companies to 
compete in the world market, it will more importantly open up unprecedented 
opportunities for both businesses and individual consumers.  I look forward to holding 
a series of hearings on these issues in the Subcommittee on Science, Space and 
Technology of the Commerce Committee this Spring.

<title>Statement by Sen. Leahy on Introduction of S. 1587</title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>
        STATEMENT OF SENATOR LEAHY ON INTRODUCTION OF
        ENCRYPTED COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT OF 1996
     
        March 5, 1996
     
        I am joined today by Senators Burns, Dole, Pressler and Murray in 
     introducing a bill that is pro-business, pro-jobs and pro-privacy. 
     
        The "Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996" would enhance 
     the global competitiveness of our high-tech industries, protect the 
     high-paying good jobs in those industries and maximize the choices in 
     encryption technology available for businesses and individuals to 
     protect the privacy, confidentiality and security of their computer, 
     telephone, and other wire and electronic communications.
     
        The guiding principle for this bill can be summed up in one 
     sentence:  Encryption is good for American business and good business 
     for Americans. 
     
        FBI Director Louis Freeh testified last week at a hearing on 
     economic espionage and quoted Secretary of State Warren Christopher as 
     saying that "our national security is inseparable from our economic 
     security." I could not agree more. Yet, American businesses are 
     suffering a double blow from our current encryption policies.  First, 
     American firms lose billions of dollars each year due to the theft of 
     proprietary economic information, which could be better protected if 
     strong encryption were more widely used. Second, government export 
     restrictions tie the hands of American high-tech businesses by barring 
     the export of strong encryption technology.  The size of these 
     combined losses makes encryption one of the critical issues facing 
     American businesses today. 
     
        Moreover, the increasing use of and dependency on networked 
     computers by Americans to obtain critical medical services, to conduct 
     research, to be entertained, to go shopping and to communicate with 
     friends and business associates, raises special concerns about the 
     privacy and confidentiality of their computer transmissions. I have 
     long been concerned about these issues, and have worked over the past 
     decade to create a legal structure to foster privacy and security for 
     our wire and electronic communications. Encryption technology provides 
     an effective way to ensure that only the people we choose can read our 
     communications.
     
        A leading encryption expert, Matt Blaze, told me in a recent letter 
     that our current regulations governing the use and export of 
     encryption are having a "deleterious effect... on our country's 
     ability to develop a reliable and trustworthy information 
     infrastructure."  It is time for Congress to take steps to put our 
     national encryption policy on the right course. 
     
        The Encrypted Communications Privacy Act would accomplish three 
     goals:
     
        First, the bill encourages the use of encryption by legislatively 
     confirming that Americans have the freedom to use and sell here in the 
     United States any encryption technology that they feel is most 
     appropriate to meet their privacy and security needs. The bill bars 
     any government-mandated use of any particular encryption system, such 
     as a key escrow encryption system.
      
        Second, for those Americans who choose to use a key escrow 
     encryption method, the bill establishes privacy standards for key 
     holders and stringent procedures for how law enforcement can obtain 
     access to decoding keys and decryption assistance. These standards 
     would subject key holders to criminal and civil liability if they 
     released the keys or divulged the identity and information about the 
     user of the encryption system, without legal authorization.  
     Commenting on these provisions, Bruce Schneir, who has literally 
     written the textbook on encryption, said in a recent letter to me that 
     the bill "recognizes the special obligations of keyholders to be 
     vigilant in safeguarding the information entrusted to them, without 
     imposing hurtles on the use of cryptography."
     
        Finally, the bill loosens export restrictions on encryption 
     products. Under the bill, it would be lawful for American companies to 
     export high-tech products with encryption capabilities when comparable 
     encryption capabilities are available from foreign suppliers, and 
     generally available encryption software, including mass market 
     products and encryption that is in the public domain. According to Mr. 
     Schneir, the bill "removes the strangle-hold that has encumbered the 
     development of mass-market security solutions" which are so vital to 
     the development of our information infrastructure. 
     
        Senator Murray took a leading role in the last Congress on 
     reforming our export restrictions on encryption, and I commend her for 
     continuing to give this important issue her committed attention again 
     in this Congress. 
     
        Current export restrictions allow the export of primarily weak 
     encryption software programs.  So weak, in fact, that a January 1996 
     report by an ad hoc group of world-renowned cryptographers and 
     computer scientists estimated that it would take a pedestrian hacker a 
     matter of hours to break and a foreign intelligence agency a matter of 
     nanoseconds to break.  No wonder that foreign buyers of encryption 
     products are increasingly looking elsewhere for strong security.  This 
     hurts the competitiveness of our high-tech industry. 
     
        A recent report by the Computer Systems Policy Project, which is a 
     group of major American computer companies estimated that U.S. 
     companies stand to lose between $30 and 60 BILLION in revenues and 
     over 200,000 of high-tech jobs by the year 2000 because U.S. companies 
     are handicapped in the global market by outdated export restrictions.
     
        Even the Commerce Department reported in January that U.S. export 
     controls may have a "negative effect on U.S. competitiveness" and "may 
     discourage" the use of strong encryption domestically since 
     manufacturers want to make only one product for export and for use 
     here.
     
        Although American companies account for almost 75 percent of the 
     global market for prepackaged software, the rest of the world is 
     competing strongly in the market for encryption software.  
     Short-sighted government policy is holding back American business. 
     Almost two years ago, I chaired a hearing of the Judiciary 
     Subcommittee on Technology and the Law on the Administration's 
     "Clipper Chip" key escrow encryption program. I  heard testimony about 
     340 foreign encryption products that were available worldwide, 155 of 
     them employing encryption in a strength that American firms were 
     prohibited from exporting.  
     
        In two short years, those numbers have increased.  According to a 
     survey of cryptographic products conducted by Trusted Information 
     System, as of December 1995, 497 foreign products from 28 countries 
     were available with encryption security. Almost 200 of these foreign 
     products used strong encryption that American companies are barred 
     from selling abroad.  This study draws the obvious conclusion that "As 
     a result, U.S. Government restrictions may be succeeding only in 
     crippling a vital American industry's exporting ability."
     
        At the Clipper Chip hearing I chaired in 1994, I heard a number of 
     reports about American companies losing business opportunities due to 
     U.S. export restrictions.  One data security company reported that 
     despite its superior system, it had been unable to respond to requests 
     from NATO and foreign  telecommunications companies because it cannot 
     export the encryption they demanded. This cost this single American 
     company millions in foregone business.  Another major computer company 
     lost two sales in Western Europe in a single year totaling about $80 
     million because the file and data encryption in the integrated system 
     they offered was not exportable.
      
        Our current export restrictions on encryption technology are 
     fencing off the global marketplace and hurting the competitiveness of 
     this part of our high-tech industries.  While national and domestic 
     security concerns must weigh heavily, we need to do a better job of 
     balancing these concerns with American business' need for encryption 
     and the economic opportunities for our high-tech industries that 
     encryption technology provides. 
     
        American businesses are not only suffering lost sales because of 
     our current export restrictions, but are also suffering staggering 
     losses due to economic espionage. FBI Director Freeh testified that 
     the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy puts the 
     amount of that loss at $100 billion per year. At a hearing last week 
     on economic espionage, we heard from one witness who had to close down 
     his software company, with a loss of 25 jobs, after China bribed an 
     employee to steal the source code for the company's software.
     
        We have bills pending before Congress to enact new criminal laws to 
     punish people who steal trade secrets or other proprietary information 
     and who break into computers to steal sensitive information.  But new 
     criminal laws are not the whole answer. Criminal laws often only come 
     into play too late, after the theft has occurred or the injury 
     inflicted. 
     
        We must encourage American firms to take preventive measures to 
     protect their vital economic information. That is where encryption 
     comes in.  Just as we have security systems to lock up our offices and 
     file drawers, we need strong encryption systems to protect the 
     security and confidentiality of business information. 
     
        The Computer Systems Policy Project estimates that, without strong 
     encryption, financial losses by the year 2000 from breaches of 
     computer security systems to be from $40 to $80 billion. 
     Unfortunately, some of these losses are already occurring.  One U.S. 
     based manufacturer is quoted in the Project's report, saying:
     
        "We had a multi-year, multi-billion dollar contract stolen off our 
     P.C. (while bidding in a foreign country). Had it been encrypted, [the 
     foreign competitor] could not have used it in the bidding time frame."
     
        New technologies present enormous opportunities for Americans, but 
     we must strive to safeguard our privacy if these technologies are to 
     prosper in this information age.  Otherwise, in the service of law 
     enforcement and intelligence needs, we will dampen any enthusiasm 
     Americans may have for taking advantage of the new technologies.
     
        I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important 
     matter, and ask unanimous consent that my full statement, the bill, a 
     summary of the bill and three letters of support from Matt Blaze, 
     Bruce Schneir, and Business Software Alliance, be included in the 
     Record.

<title>Letter from Bruce Schneier</title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>
March 1, 1996

Hon. Patrick Leahy
United States Senate

Dear Senator Leahy,

    I would like to thank you for introducing the Encrypted
Communications Privacy Act.  As a member of the computer and information
security research community, I am keenly aware of the vital role of
cryptography in fostering the development of our information infrastructure.

    As the author of the book, "Applied Cryptography", I have unusual
insights into the absurdity of cryptography export restrictions.  It is
not without irony that one may export my book in paper format, but not
electronically.  Presumably no rational person believes that the
current restrictions actually prevent the spread of cryptography.  I
believe you recognize this, as evidenced from the strong stance taken
in your bill.

    As the bill recognizes, we can no longer afford to hold on to the
obsolete notion that cryptography is the sole province of government
communications; the growth of modern networks has irrevocably pushed
it into the mainstream.  I applaud you leadership towards codifying
these principles in a balanced and responsible way.  In particular,
the bill:

      o Removes the regulatory strangle-hold that has encumbered
        the development of mass-market security solutions; 

      o Recognizes the futility of applying regulations intended to
        control the international arms trade to even the most 
        mundane and commonly available software;

      o Encourages public confidence in encryption by allowing
        the marketplace to provide a full range of choices for
        privacy and security needs;

      o Recognizes the special obligations of keyholders to be
        vigilant in safeguarding the information entrusted to
        them, without imposing hurtles on the use of cryptography;

      o Allows the United States to continue its leadership role as
        a technological innovator;

      o Acknowledges the pivotal role of cryptography in electronic
        commerce.

    I continue to have concerns that the new criminal obstruction
provision will discourage law abiding citizens from using cryptography.
I hope that legislative history and further discussion will demonstrate
the narrow intent of this crime.

    Overall, your bill takes very necessary strides towards ensuring that
the protections we take for granted in traditional media keep pace with
technology, and I commend your efforts.

                                Sincerely,

                                     /s/

                                Bruce Schneier

<title>Exon/Coats Communications Decency Act as passed by the US Senate 6/14/95</title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>

This strikes all of Title IV of S. 652 and replaces it with the following:

Sec.___ OBSCENE OR HARASSING USE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES UNDER
        THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934

Section 223 (47 U.S.C. 223) is amended --

   (1) by striking subsection (a) and inserting in lieu thereof:

 ``(a) Whoever--
       ``(1) in the District of Columbia or in interstate or 
     foreign communications
       
	``(A) by means of telecommunications device knowingly--

<title>Testimony Of Dee Jepsen, Executive Director, Enough Is 
Enough</title>
<body>
<pre>

Mr. Chairman, I speak today in support of S.892, The Protection of 
Children from Computer Pornography Act of 1995. In my capacity as 
President of "Enough is Enough!"--a non-profit, non-partisan women's 
organization opposing child pornography and illegal obscenity, I am very 
familiar with the issue of contemporary pornography--its content, 
availability and its harms. I speak not only on behalf of "Enough is 
Enough!" but, on a personal level, as a woman and as a grandmother of 
nine. 

Although we have many caring men involved in our work, our organization 
focuses primarily upon educating and mobilizing women, because women 
speak with a special authority on the issue of pornography--for we, and 
our children are its primary subjects...and its primary victims. 
Pornography demeans and degrades women, victimizes children and ruins 
men. It contributes to domestic and spouse abuse, rape, incest and child 
molestation. And a great share of it is not protected speech, any more 
than libel, slander or false advertising are protected speech; 
therefore, it is not a 1st Amendment issue. It is not legal material. 
Many Americans do not realize this fact.

Today, America finds itself at a point of serious reassessment. 
Americans are coming rapidly to the awareness that the moral fabric of 
our country has become badly frayed. The consequences have become 
apparent. Due to the recent media focus upon "cyberporn," and consequent 
growing public awareness of computer pornography and its availability, 
especially to children, pornography has been thrust into prominence on 
America's reassessment agenda. The problem of pornography is an issue 
whose time has come.

From all sides more and more voices are proclaiming that our culture is 
in crisis--a crisis of character. A second White House Conference on 
Character was convened. Organizations to promote character have been 
formed. For over a year, Bill Bennett's book, The Book of Virtues, has 
been near the top of the New York Times best-seller list. Traditional 
family values are being touted in nationwide political campaigns, by 
both parties. The entertainment industry is being challenged "to clean 
up its act." 

And while Congress and the Administration are wrestling with how to 
balance the budget and reduce the deficit so our children and 
grandchildren will not inherit our debts, there is another issue they 
must address as well...how to provide a protected space in which our 
children and grandchildren can grow up. As our common culture has become 
coarser, children have been robbed of their childhood. A time of 
innocence has been stolen away from today's children. It is time that 
adults of this nation take responsibility to combat the predators who 
are polluting the minds of our nation's most valuable resource--our 
children. The Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act of 
1995 is a step in that direction, and is needed.

Recently, PRIME TIME did a television program on children and sex, 
starkly revealing that children 10 and younger are being "sexualized" 
due to constant exposure to sexually-oriented materials. In an interview 
with Oprah, discussing sensational TV talk shows, First Lady Hillary 
Clinton asserted, "I'm tired of folks saying we can't change it because 
that's censorship." I, and many other Americans, would agree that tired 
excuse, which is now also being used in reference to any legislation or 
regulation of computer pornography, will no longer work in this country. 
Moms and dads, grandmothers and grandfathers--all responsible citizens, 
will not accept this feeble defense of doing nothing to protect the 
well-being and safety of children.

Clinical studies and life experiences attest to the fact that 
pornography numbs the moral conscience, stunts moral growth and 
encourages anti- social behavior. In our organization's work with 
victims, we continually look into the eyes and hear from the hearts of 
those that have been bruised and broken by the effects of pornography. 
When we allow pornography to be freely available to children, 
pornography is not only an attack upon the present, but an attack upon 
the future as well. Once pornography has been viewed by young, 
vulnerable children, it can start a chain of abuse that carries over 
into their adult and family lives. You cannot simply push the delete 
button and eliminate those pornographic images from their memories; they 
will continue to play over and over again in the theater of their 
minds...perhaps for life.

Over the years the pornography industry has had two basic business 
goals. To remove as much of the social stigma as possible from consuming 
pornography; secondly, to use every advance in technology to lessen the 
difficulty of purchasing and consuming pornography. 

Until the late 1970's, pornography was primarily available in magazines 
and 8mm film loops. It was distributed through the mail, street stalls 
and pornographic bookstores in the "bad part of town." The distasteful 
locations limited the market.

In the 1980's the advent of the VCR was exploited by pornographers. 
Consumers could purchase videos and watch pornography right in their own 
homes. In addition, the ability to charge customers for special phone 
numbers led to the development of dial-a-porn. Satellite technology and 
the growth of cable led to further inroads by pornographers world-wide. 

Then came the advent of personal computers (PCs), and a whole new world 
of pornography access rushed in through its floodgate. Computer related 
developments will shape how the pornography industry seeks to market its 
products over the next quarter-century. And who will suffer the 
most?...the children!

Today, we face an insidious threat---hard-core, child pornography and 
"indecent" material, which is harmful to minors, are being transmitted 
over the Internet directly into our homes. The Information Super Highway 
has been invaded by morally-irresponsible, reckless drivers, who travel 
the Highway with total disregard for the damage inflicted on young minds 
through the pornography they provide. Children are usually more adept 
than adults at operating computers, and today, with little effort, a 
child with a computer and a modem can download the most vile and 
perverse, often violent, hard-core pornography ever produced. This 
material includes such themes as incest, rape, bestiality (actual sex 
with most of the animals in Noah's Ark), torture and mutilation. This 
material can be accessed in full and clear color with just a few 
computer key clicks. This is pornography that the Supreme Court has 
ruled not to be protected speech, and is illegal for adults as well as 
children. There is federal legislation outlawing it. We need S.892, 
however, to provide federal legislation outlawing "indecent" material. 
This material is not protected speech and is already legislated against 
in most states and many local communities under the rubric of "material 
harmful to minors." With the advent of computers which send indecent 
material across state lines this federal legislation is needed.

Pornography is harmful and destructive in the following ways: 

* it plays a major role in the molestation of children, serving as an
  instruction manual for these crimes;
* it exposes children at an impressionable age to attitudes and 
  behaviors that warp and twist their view of human dignity and 
  sexuality; 
* it shapes negative, degrading attitudes about women, erotizing 
  inequality;
* it encourages rape and the rape myth, that women say "no" but mean 
  "yes" and they like violence;
*  it erotizes violence and then fuels sexual violence; 
*  it holds an addictive and fatal attraction for many men and teenage 
   boys, it invades their thoughts and manipulates their behavior; 
*  it encourages the transmission of STD's (sexually transmitted 
   diseases) and
*  it lowers community standards, which has a denigrating affect upon 
   our entire culture.

Some say that pornography is a victimless crime; this is a myth 
perpetrated by those profiting through this multi-billion dollar 
industry and pornography consumers. What we see, and what we hear and 
read affect how we think and how we act. That is why companies spend 
millions of dollars on advertising each year...it works. And, of course, 
this premise is the very basis of all education. 

Not only is any child with a computer and a modem at risk of exposure to 
pornography on the Internet, but they are at risk of being exposed to 
pedophiles there as well. Pedophiles are those adults who have a sexual 
appetite for young children. They now electronically lurk on the 
Information Super Highway, as in schoolyards, to stalk their prey, 
unsuspecting children. Let me give you a real life example. 

A friend of one of the "Enough is Enough!" staff members tells how her 
husband intercepted a suspicious letter from a distant state addressed 
to their 16-year-old daughter. The letter proved to be from an adult man 
to whom the young girl had given her real name and address over her 
computer.

This electronic predator began his letter by asking the girl to describe 
her fantasies, and then described his. He went into graphic, vulgar 
sexual detail. At first the teen-ager laughed about it, but quickly 
realized that it was no laughing matter, for her obscene "pen pal" could 
show up on her doorstep one day to fulfill his fantasy. She had made the 
dangerous mistake of giving out her real name and address to an unknown 
person through her home computer.

As the public debate about computer pornography has intensified in 
recent weeks, there has often been misinformation, or partial 
information appearing in print. The detractors of efforts to address the 
issue legislatively have taken to various forms of attack in defense of 
electronic pornography. Their desperation is apparent as the truth about 
this situation has been brought to light. Seldom, even in these times of 
hyper-scrutiny and scathing criticism, does the level of viciousness 
reach the level it has on this issue. These detractors have tried to 
discredit and "beat-up" the messengers when they haven't liked the 
message. They have contested the exact percentages of various types of 
computer pornography available and how many people consume it. For those 
of us who are battling this vile and degrading material, that is exactly 
where we would like to stage the debate. Does it really matter what the 
exact percentage is of material that is available by computer, to 
children as well as adults -- material that degrades and tortures women, 
sexually uses children and debases human beings (and, in the view of 
animal lovers, even animals). Any is too much. One child's life 
misdirected into unhealthy sexual behavior is too much.

If we do nothing to stem this flood of pornography available to children 
by computer, we will be changing the base line on the availability of 
illegal material. It will be comparable to inviting children to have 
free access into adult x-rated bookstores and theaters. 

In reality, we will never be able to eliminate all illegal pornography 
and protect all children from exposure to pornography. It is, however, 
imperative that we do all we can and we should do it in a reasoned, 
reasonable, yet responsible manner. It will take everyone working 
together to produce the best answer, or answers, to the problems of 
cyberporn.

Some are saying that this problem is totally the parents responsibility. 
Parents must become educated about the dangers present in unmonitored 
computer use by their children. Parents also need to learn more about 
computer technology in order to do so. But to place all the 
responsibility upon the parents not only is unfair, it is inadequate to 
protect children. Parents can't be present 100% of the time to monitor 
their children, and they certainly cannot monitor what happens when they 
are at the homes of friends, whose parents may not be as informed or 
vigilant. Bringing a computer into your home for your child's use under 
this proposed solution is like having them bring home a rabid dog for 
the kids to play with, sitting him in a corner and then having to watch 
them constantly so the dog won't bite them.

Some suggest technical screening "fixes". There are some developed now 
and more are being worked upon. These are goods ideas, but to say that 
this is the total answer is once again unfair and inadequate. Prior to 
this time those who wanted to consume pornography had to pay for it. Are 
we now going to say those who do not want pornography for their kids 
have pay not to get it? This would be a major shift of policy and 
approach. In addition, those who have in-depth computer understanding 
acknowledge that there is no way to screen all pornographic material. 

It is often asked that if much of this material is illegal (not 
protected speech) isn't it up to law enforcement to simply enforce the 
law? There should be aggressive enforcement of the pornography laws in 
the area of computer porn. The reality is, however, that law enforcement 
resources are limited and it is difficult to monitor and enforce this 
electronic outlet.

To find effective solutions to the pornography problem, it will take the 
combination of education, legislative action, public policy initiatives 
and aggressive law enforcement, as well as the exercise of corporate and 
individual responsibility. The answer is everyone working together-- 
parents, individual citizens, schools, legislators, law enforcement and 
the corporate electronic business community. We must all take the 
responsibility to protect the welfare of our nation's children. Those in 
the technology community should be encouraged to work diligently to find 
every way possible to protect children from destructive pornographic 
material via computer. Yet we must all be committed to protecting both 
the free flow of material on the Information Superhighway and the 
children of the country. The Grassley bill does not place an unfair 
burden upon the access providers, but it does place responsibility upon 
them to do what they can do to protect the nation's computer-using 
children. 

Serial killer Ted Bundy said just hours before he was executed in 1989 
for his heinous, sex crimes against women and children, "...I take full 
responsibility for what I've done...My experience with pornography that 
deals on a violent level with sexuality you become addicted to it...the 
barriers to really doing something were being tested constantly, and 
assailed through the kind of fantasy life that was fueled by 
pornography...pornography, which was an indispensable link to the chain 
of behavior, the chain of events that led to the behavior, to the 
assaults, to the murders. I have met a lot of men who were motivated to 
commit violence just like me. Without exception, every one of them was 
deeply involved in pornography..."

I am urging the passage of the Grassley Bill S.892, The Protection of 
Children from Computer Pornography Act of 1995 because it will help to 
protect children from exposure to pornography and suffering its life- 
changing impact. I am hopeful that members of both parties will check 
their other differences at the door and join ranks on this issue...for 
the sake of the children.

<title>Gingrich Says CDA is a "clear violation of free speech rights"</title>
<p>
<p>
Gingrich made these remarks on June 20 1995 on a national 
television show, the Progress Report carried on National Empowerment 
Television during a discussion with Rep. Bob Walker (R-PA) and Progress 
and Freedom Foundation Chairman Jay Keyworth.
<p>
Gingrich said:
<p>
"I think that the Amendment you referred to by Senator Exon in the 
Senate will have no real meaning and have no real impact and in fact 
I don't think will survive. It is clearly a violation of free speech 
and it's a violation of the right of adults to communicate with each 
other. I don't agree with it and I don't think it is a serious way to 
discuss a serious issue, which is, how do you maintain the right of free 
speech for adults while also protecting children in a medium which is 
available to both? That's also frankly a problem with television and radio, 
and it's something that we have to wrestle with in a calm and mature way 
as a society. I think by offering a very badly thought out and not very 
productive amendment, if anything, that put the debate back a step."

To:		Interested Persons<br>
From:	The Center For Democracy And Technology<br>
Date:		May  1995<br>
Subject:	Public Accountability, Privacy, and Cost Reimbursement in 
Digital 	Telephony Implementation<br></h3>
<hr size = 2>
<h3>I.	 Overview</h3>
<p>
<p>
<font size = +1>In October of 1994 Congress enacted the Communications 
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) (PL 103-414), also known as the 
"Digital Telephony" legislation.  The statute requires telecommunications 
carriers to ensure that their systems contain sufficient capability and capacity 
to permit law enforcement to conduct electronic surveillance.   Although law 
enforcement officials must still obtain a search warrant in order to conduct a 
wiretap, the statute granted law enforcement new authority to influence the 
design of telecommunications networks. This authority must be closely 
monitored to ensure that law enforcement does not abuse the powers granted 
to it under the statute.
<p>
The statute also contains specific new statutory privacy protections for 
transactional records generated by online electronic communications services, 
prohibitions on pen register authority to gather location information, and 
greater protection for cordless telephones. Furthermore, the statute contains 
provisions which require public accountability and oversight over 
government design authority, telecommunications carrier liability, standards 
setting, and cost reimbursement.
<p>
The expanded law enforcement authority granted by this statute requires 
diligent use of the provisions designed to protect privacy and ensure public 
accountability.   The Center for Democracy and Technology both on its own 
and with the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (a coalition of 
public interest organizations, representatives from the telecommunications, 
computer, online services, and software industries and associations, 
coordinated by CDT) will vigorously monitor the implementation of the 
Digital Telephony statute. CDT stands ready to intervene before the Federal 
Communications Commission, the telecommunications industry standards 
bodies charged with setting technical standards for implementing the 
requirements, and at other points as necessary to ensure that privacy is 
protected and public accountability is enforced.
<p>
This document will describe the provisions of the statute that specify 
obligations on government and telecommunications carriers. Among the 
these points, perhaps the most critical is that the statute is specifically not self 
implementing.  No tax-payer funds can be spent under the statute until the 
government completes specific procedures (detailed below), each of which 
provides an opportunity for public oversight and intervention.  
<p>
In addition, the statute contains other important public oversight and 
accountability provisions. Among these:
<p><ul>
<li>Requirements for notice and public comment before and after law 
enforcement requests surveillance capacity from telecommunications 
carriers,
<p>
<li>Technical standards for meeting the requirements of the statute must be 
set by industry standards setting-bodies, not the government,
<p>
<li>Technical standards developed under the statute can be challenged by the 
public for any reason in a proceeding before the FCC,
<p>
<li>Detailed reports by the Attorney General and Comptroller General of the 
costs and scope of compliance,
<p></ul>
Finally, the statute requires the government to reimburse 
telecommunications carriers for capacity upgrades, as well as capability 
upgrades where compliance is not "reasonably achievable."   The legislation 
authorized, but did not appropriate, $500 million for this purpose.  If Congress 
fails to appropriate funds to cover reimbursement, telecommunications 
carriers will not be required to comply with all the requirements of the

<h3>II.	Current Status of Appropriations 
Process</h3>
<p>
<p>
The specific method of financing CALEA implementation, as well as the total 
1996 outlay, have not yet been determined.  However, regardless of 
Congressional Appropriations decisions or the sum of appropriated funds, no 
funds can be spent under the legislation until the Attorney General 
determines which telecommunications carrier's networks require upgrades 
or changes in order to comply with the statute.
<p>
<a name = "compliance>The Administration recommended in its 1996 
</a>budget to fund the program through a 30-percent surcharge on civil 
monetary penalties and criminal fines at a level of 100 million dollars 
for the first year, though at the time of this writing no final proposal 
has been introduced.
<p>
<p>
<h3>III.	Compliance</h3>
<p>
For the purposes of the statute, a 'telecommunications carrier' refers to "any 
person or entity engaged in the transmission or switching of wire or 
electronic communications as a common carrier for hire" (Sec. 102 (8)). This 
definition is intended to include local exchange carriers, cellular and PCS 
carriers, and those persons or entities which the FCC determines provide a 
replacement for a substantial portion of the local exchange market (Sec. 102 
(8)(B)). The requirements of the statute do not apply to information service 
providers, private networks, or equipment, facilities, or services whose sole 
purpose is interconnecting telecommunications carriers (Sec 103 (b)).
<p>
In determining how appropriated funds will be spent under the statute, the 
Attorney General must complete a series of studies and consultations, and 
provide notice to telecommunications carriers and to the public. These 
provisions of the statue are outlined below.
<p>
The statute separates compliance into two categories: <b>capacity</b> (i.e., 
the ability of a system to accommodate a specified number of intercepts, pen 
register and trap and trace devices), and <b>capability</b> (i.e., the ability to 
meet the capability requirements of the statute (sec. 103, see below)).  
<p>
The process for telecommunications carrier compliance with the capability 
requirements, and the obligations on law enforcement will be discussed first.
<p>
<h3>A.	Capability Requirements</h3>
<p>
Section 103 of the statute requires telecommunications carriers to meet four 
functional requirements to enable law enforcement to conduct electronic 
surveillance.  These requirements are to:
<ol>
<li>expeditiously isolate and enable the government to intercept all wire and 
electronic communications within a carrier's network;
<p>
<li>expeditiously isolate and enable the government to access call-identifying 
information;
<p>
<li>deliver intercepted communications and call-identifying information to a 
location specified by the government (but only with the affirmative 
intervention of the telecommunications carrier).  Remote monitoring is 
explicitly prohibited; 
<p>
<li>to meet these requirements in a way that protects the privacy and security 
of communications and call-identifying information not authorized to be 
intercepted.</ol>
<p>
<b>Compliance with Capability Requirements</b>
<p>
Telecommunications carriers have four years to comply with the capability 
requirements. However, before a carrier is responsible for making any 
changes to its network, the government must first determine what specific 
capabilities it needs, and consult with the telecommunications industry. The 
telecommunications industry, through standards bodies, must develop 
technical standards to meet the capability requirements, and these standards 
can be challenged before the FCC if any person believes they do not adequately 
protect privacy or fail to meet other requirements. 
<p>
Below is an outline of the capacity compliance process, including a detailed 
accounting of the obligations on the government and telecommunications 
carriers.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Government Prohibited from Requiring Specific Design of Features 
or Services:</b> The statute specifically prohibits the government from 
requiring a telecommunications carrier to adopt specific design features or 
systems configurations, or to prohibit a carrier from deploying any feature or 
service that does not meet the requirements (section 103 (d)). Technical 
standards developed to meet the requirements outlined above must be 
created by telecommunications trade associations or standards setting bodies, 
in consultation with the Attorney General (sec 107 (a)(1)). 
<p>
<li><b>Consultation Required before Standards Setting Process:</b>  The 
consultation process required under section 107 (a) must occur before any 
standards are developed.  The beginning stages of the consultation have 
begun through the TILU process described above. Telecommunications 
carriers have 4 years to comply with the capability requirements, and then 
only subject to reimbursement for modifications which are not "reasonably 
achievable" under section 109 (a).</ul>
<p>
<b>Public Accountability and Privacy Protecting Provisions With Respect to 
Standards Setting</b>
<p>
The statute provides several opportunities for public intervention with 
respect to standards setting, including a requirement that standards be 
publicly available and an opportunity for any person to challenge a standard 
before the FCC.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Public Oversight of Standards Setting Process: </b> A 
telecommunications carrier is in compliance with the statute if it is in 
compliance with publicly available standards set by trade associations or 
standards-bodies (section 107 (a)(2)).  Because these standards must be publicly 
available in order for a carrier to be in compliance (section 107 (a)(2)), the 
public will have the opportunity to examine these standards.
<p>
<li><b>Public Intervention before FCC: </b> If the standards are deficient, 
particularly in terms of privacy protection, network security, cost to 
ratepayers, or for any other reason, any person can petition the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) to hold a rulemaking to establish 
standards. In setting standards under this provision, the FCC must ensure 
that the standards: 
<p>
<ul><li>Protect the privacy and security of communications not authorized 
to be intercepted, and
<p>
<li>Minimize the cost of such compliance on residential ratepayers.</ul>
</ul><p>
This provision provides a lever of public accountability for the assistance 
requirements of the statute (sec 103), and, if properly utilized, will help to 
ensure that technical standards for meeting these requirements to not 
unnecessarily diminish privacy or increase costs to consumers.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Privacy Protections Must be Considered at Design Stage: </b> 
Technical standards set under the assistance capability requirements (section 
103) must "protect the privacy and security of communications not 
authorized to be intercepted" (sec 103 (a)(4)(A)). This provision requires 
telecommunications carriers, and telecommunications industry standards 
bodies, to consider privacy protection at the design stage and enshrine those 
protections into technical standards.  Before this legislation was enacted, 
telecommunications carriers were not required to consider privacy protection 
when designing their networks.</ul>
<p>
Because carriers and standards bodies are required to consider privacy 
protection during the standard setting process, and because standards set 
through this process can be challenged before the FCC for any reason, these 
provisions (if properly implemented) will enable the public to:
<p><ol>
<li>ensure that privacy is not compromised by technical standards developed 
to meet the requirements of the statute
<p>
<li>know what law enforcement's surveillance capability is, and
<p>
<li>have the opportunity to challenge law enforcement's capacity requests 
before they are implemented by telecommunications carriers.
</ol><p>
<b>Funding for Capability Requirements</b>
<p>
The government is required to reimburse telecommunications carriers for all 
costs associated with meeting the capability requirements for upgrades of 
equipment deployed before January 1, 1995, and for costs where modifications 
are not "reasonably achievable" (based on a determination by the FCC), for 
features and services deployed after January first 1995.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Features and services deployed before January 1, 1995 -- Government 
Reimbursement for all compliance costs: </b> The statute requires the 
government to reimburse carriers for reasonable costs directly associated with 
modifications necessary to meet the requirements (section 109 (a)). However, 
these modifications will not be made, and no funds will be spent, until the 
government consults with telecommunications carriers to facilitate the 
development of technical standards as specified under section 107.
<p>
<li><b>Features and services deployed after January 1, 1995 -- Government 
Reimbursement for modifications not 'Reasonably Achievable':</b>  The 
statute requires the government, subject to a request from a 
telecommunications carrier or other interested person, to reimburse a carrier 
for the costs of modifications which are not "reasonably achievable" (section 
109 (b)).  The FCC will determine whether compliance is reasonably 
achievable based on an analysis of whether compliance would impose a 
significant difficulty or expense on the carrier or the users of its network, and 
shall consider:<p>
<ul>
<li>the effect on public safety and national security
<li>the effect on rates for basic residential telephone service
<li>the need to protect the privacy and security of communications not 
<li>authorized to be intercepted
<li>the need to achieve the capability assistance requirements of section 103 
	by cost-effective methods 
</ul></ul>
and other factors. Interested parties, including privacy and consumer 
advocates, will have an opportunity to intervene in these proceedings. 
Furthermore, these proceedings will be public record, providing an important 
level of public accountability to law enforcement's surveillance requests. This 
will ensure that law enforcement is not making unreasonable demands for 
unnecessary capability, or force the public to incur the costs of compliance as a 
hidden surcharge on their monthly bill. Instead, the entire process, both the 
requests for capability and the cost of compliance will be available to the 
public with an opportunity to intervene.
<p>
<h3>B.	Capacity Requirements</h3>
<p>
The statute also requires telecommunications carriers to ensure that their 
system possesses sufficient capacity to accommodate a specified number of 
simultaneous intercepts, pen register, and trap and trace devices.  The statute 
requires the Attorney General to consult with telecommunications carriers, 
then publish specific capacity requirements in the federal register for notice 
and comment by the public. The Government is required to reimburse 
telecommunications carriers for all reasonable costs associated with capacity 
upgrades.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Determination of Capacity Needs:</b>  Before making any requests to 
telecommunications carriers under this provision, the government must 
determine what its capacity needs will be. This process, headed by the FBI's 
Telecommunications Industry Liaison Unit (TILU), has begun soliciting 
information from telecommunications carriers as well as state and local law 
enforcement agencies. The statute requires that this process be completed, and 
notice provided to telecommunications carriers and to the public, on or 
before October 25, 1996 (sec 104 (a)(1)). 
<p>
<li><b>Consultation with State and local law enforcement agencies and 
telecommunications carriers and general public required:</b> Section 104 of 
the statute requires the Attorney General to consult with state and local law 
enforcement agencies, telecommunications carriers, manufacturers of 
telecommunications equipment in order to determine where capacity 
upgrades will be required and what those upgrades will be. After an 
opportunity for public comment (required in section 104 (a)(1)), the Attorney 
General must publish in the federal register and provide to 
telecommunications carriers:
<p><ol>
<li><b>Notice of Actual Capacity: </b>The actual number of intercepts, pen 
registers, and trap and trace devices that will be necessary 4 years from the 
date of enactment (sec 104 (a)(1)(A)); and
<p>
<li><b>Notice of Maximum Capacity: </b>The maximum capacity required 
to accommodate all intercepts, pen registers and trap and trace devices that 
the Attorney General estimates that government agencies will be authorized 
to conduct simultaneously after the date 4 years after enactment (sec 104 
(a)(1)(B)).</ol>
<p>
<li><b>Publication of Capacity Requirements: </b> Based on the results of the 
TILU survey, the Attorney general will then publish capacity notices as 
described above (and as required under section 104 of the statute).  
Telecommunications carriers will then have 3 years to comply with capacity 
notices, subject to government reimbursement (sec 104 (b) and (e)).
</ul>
<b>Public Accountability Provisions</b>
<p>
There are two separate opportunities for public oversight of the Capacity 
compliance process. 
<p><ul>
<li><b>Notice and Comment Required: </b> Section 104 (a)(1) of the statute 
requires notice and comment before the Attorney general publishes the final 
capacity notices. Thus, the law request that the results of the TILU survey of 
telecommunications carrier capacity and the recommendations for capacity 
upgrades must be made available to the public for comment. If the FBI is 
believed to be making unreasonable demands for surveillance capacity based 
on the TILU recommendations the public will know and will have an 
opportunity to challenge the recommendations.
<p>
<li><b>Publication in Federal Register: </b> The notices of capacity needs, as 
required under section 104 (a), must be published in the Federal Register, 
providing the public with a second opportunity to ensure that law 
enforcement is not making unreasonable capacity demands.
</ul><p>
<b>Funding for Capacity Upgrades</b>                          
<p>
The entire process outlined above, including the public accountability 
opportunities, must occur before the government can spend any tax-payer 
funds to reimburse telecommunications carriers. 
<p><ul>
<li><b>Government Reimbursement for Capacity Upgrades:</b>  Section 104 
(e) requires the government to reimburse telecommunications carriers for all 
<a name = "report">reasonable (*as defined in Section 109 (a), described below) costs associated </a>with capacity upgrades required by the statute.   If the government fails to reimburse a carrier, that carrier will not have to modify any feature or serv


ice.  This provision is intended to ensure that the government prioritizes capacity  requests and does not demand unnecessary surveillance capability financed by hidden charges to subscribers.
</ul><p>
<h3>V.	Reporting Requirements</h3>
<p>
Finally, section 112 of the statute requires the government to issue several 
reports on the costs of meeting the capability and capacity requirements of the 
statute.  These reports will provide the public with a detailed accounting of 
law enforcement surveillance expenditures, as well as an accounting of law 
enforcement surveillance capability and capacity, including capability and 
capacity for which law enforcement did not reimburse telecommunications 
carriers. 
<p>
Starting on November 30, 1995 and for every year after, the Attorney General 
will report:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Government Costs:</b> a detailed accounting of the amounts paid to 
each carrier and the equipment, facility, or service for which the amounts 
were paid;
<p>
<li><b>Future Cost:</b> projections of the amounts expected to be paid in 
the current fiscal year, the carriers to which payment is expected to be made, 
and the equipment, facilities, or services for which payment is expected to be 
made.
<p></ul>
In addition to reports by the Attorney General, the Comptroller General, after 
consulting with the Attorney General and the telecommunications industry, 
will issue a report every 2 years describing:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Extent of Network Design Changes Made as a Result of CALEA:</b> 
the type of equipment, facilities, and services that have been brought into 
compliance under the statute;
<p>
<li><b>Cost-Effectiveness of Government Reimbursement: </b>an analysis of the 
reasonableness and cost-effectiveness of the payments made by the 
Attorney General to telecommunications carriers for modifications necessary 
to ensure compliance under the statute.</ul>
<p>
<a name = "privacy">This report will also include a description of the costs to be incurred by</A>  telecommunications carriers to comply with the capability requirements after the effective date, including projections of the cost and a description of the


 equipment and services for which cots will be incurred.
<p>
<h3>VI.	New Privacy Protections</h3> 
<p>
The statute adds several new statutory privacy protections. In addition to 
monitoring the implementation of the capability and capacity requirements 
and cost reimbursement provisions, these new privacy protections must be 
vigorously enforced.
<ul>
<li><b>Increased Protection for Online Transactional Information:</b>  
Section 207 (a) amended 18 USC 2703 to increase the standard for law 
enforcement access to transactional data generated by electronic 
communications services from a mere subpoena to a court order based on 
"specific and articulable facts" that such records are "relevant and material to 
an ongoing criminal investigation" (sec 207 (a)(2)).
</ul><p>
By enacting this provision, Congress recognized that transactional 
information generated by electronic communications networks such as the 
Internet, electronic bulletin boards and commercial online services (such as 
America Online and Compuserve) reveal a great deal more about the content 
of a specific communication than do telephone toll records.  Because online 
transactional records are personally identifiable, this provision raised the 
standard for law enforcement access to require the affirmative intervention of 
a Judge, a standard similar to (although not as strong as) that required for law 
enforcement access to the content of a communication.
<ul><p>
<li><b>Limitation on Pen Register Authority to Preclude Location and other 
Transactional Information:</b> Section 207 (b) amended 18 USC 2516 to limit 
the design of pen register devices (devices which identifies numbers dialed) to 
prevent the use of pen registers to track individuals throughout the network 
or to reveal information beyond numbers dialed.  
</ul><P>
This section prohibits the authority for pen register devices to be used to 
obtain tracking or location information, other than that which can be 
determined from the telephone number.  This provision is particularly 
important in wireless networks, where transactional data that can be obtained 
through a pen register device can reveal location information. The section 
further creates a "technical minimization requirement", requiring law 
enforcement to use reasonably available technology to minimize the ability of 
pen register devices to generate any information beyond numbers dialed.
 <ul><p>
<li><b>Expanded Protection for Cordless Telephones:</b>  Section 202 
extends the privacy protections of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act 
(ECPA) to cover cordless telephones.  Specifically, sec. 202 brings the radio 
portion of a cordless telephone communication (the transmission between 
the handset and the base unit) under section 2510 of ECPA.
<p>
<li><b>No Prohibition on the Use of Encryption:</b>  Section 103 (b)(3) 
explicitly affirms the right of subscribers to use encryption, and places no 
<a name = "concl">obligation on a telecommunications carrier to have the ability (or to ensure </a> the government's ability) to decrypt a communication, unless the encryption product is provided by the carrier or the carrier has the information necessary


 to decrypt it. 
</ul><p>
<h3>VII.	Conclusion</h3>
<p>
If properly adhered to, these statutory privacy protections, combined with the 
public accountability provisions outlined earlier provide the public with a 
significant degree of oversight over law enforcement surveillance capabilities.
<p>
However, in order to ensure that the privacy protections are properly 
implemented and adhered to, the compliance process must be closely 
monitored and, when necessary, the provisions allowing intervention and 
public oversight must be utilized.

<title>Testimony of Dr. Susan Elliot, Mother from McLean VA</title>
<body>
<pre>

TESTIMONY OF DR. SUSAN ELLIOT, MOTHER FROM MCLEAN VA

I am a parent of three teenage children - a girl, age 17, and boys age 
14 and 12. Our brush with CyberPorn was, happily, not devastating or 
dramatic, but it was disturbing. It was, I think, an experience shared 
by many families before the public became aware of pornography on the 
Internet.

First, I must say that my children are normal, intelligent, well- 
adjusted individuals. They get good grades, participate year-round in 
sports activities, and have never been involved with drugs or alcohol. 
Their sexual experiences have, I hope, been limited to viewing the swim 
suit issue of Sports Illustrated and thwarted attempts at making out. In 
short, they were not predisposed to search for pornography on the 
Internet, nor are they computer hackers. 

A respected teacher suggested that they might benefit from information 
sharing in the Internet. Our household had been inundated by promotional 
discs from America-On-Line and so we logged on line. At first the boys, 
along with many classmates, participates in the public chat rooms. I sat 
with them while the "chatted" and found it harmless, if somewhat silly. 
However, one cannot sit with teenagers twenty-four hours a day and soon, 
without my knowledge, the boys ventured into the more exciting realm of 
the "private" chat rooms, Many of these rooms are private because they 
are specialized or technical, but some are private because they pertain 
to human sexuality. Being normal boys, my children were curious about 
these rooms. While "chatting" they were offered "pictures" by other 
participants. They accepted a few of these, as did their classmates. 
With great ease these children were able to E-Mail hard core pornography 
in full color back and forth to each other. This might have gone on for 
some time if my husband had not noted that the memory of our computer 
was rapidly filling up. We opened up the "trash" file and found the 
graphics in question. They portrayed varying numbers of humans and 
animals engaged in a horrifying gamut of sexual activities. The pictures 
were lewd and obscene by any standards. 

We immediately confronted the children with questions about the pictures 
and they confessed all. We shared out experience with many of our 
friends and severed our relations with America On-Line. Many long 
discussions about sexuality and appropriate expectations and behavior 
have ensued and our family has benefitted from these talks. 

That, in a nutshell, was our experience with pornography on the 
Internet. Was any lasting damage done? My boys would say "Yes." They 
were asked to pay $38 from their allowances for on-line time. (Color 
graphics are expensive). I, too, would say "Yes" - not because my 
children have become victims or sexual predators - but because on of 
their early sexual images will, forever, be something which is not 
tender, or beautiful, or even harmlessly titillating; but something 
which is coarse, vile, and ugly.

Senate Proffer on Obscenity

NOVEMBER 17, 1995

TITLE IV -- OBSCENE, HARASSING, AND WRONGFUL UTILIZATION OF 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.

SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE

        This title may be cited as the "Communications Decency Act of 
1995".

SEC. 402. OBSCENE OR HARASSING USE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES 
UNDER THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934.

(a) OFFENSES. section 223 (47 U.S.C. 223) is amended

         Testimony Regarding the Protection of Children 
             From Computer Pornography Act of 1995
 
                  Submitted by Stephen Balkam

                      Executive Director
              Recreational Software Advisory Council

                Hearing of the Judiciary Committee

                         U.S. Senate
                       Washington, D.C.
                        July 24, 1995


Introduction

My name is Stephen Balkam and I am the Executive Director of the 
Recreational Software Advisory Council. Thank you for the opportunity to 
give testimony to this Committee on what is an increasingly important 
issue as the span and breadth of the Internet continues to grow. I would 
like to request, Chairman, that the record be left open so that I and 
others may supplement my testimony after the hearing . 

The RSAC is an independent, not for profit organization established in 
September 1994 with the help of the Software Publishers Association and 
five other trade associations. The rating of computer software is too 
important an issue to be left to a trade association, so our independent 
constitutional status and our Board of Directors (made up of a majority 
of those from outside the industry) is free from any undue outside or 
commercial influence.

RSACs very existence is a direct result of the legislative initiative 
taken by Senators Lieberman and Kohl last year that raised the issue of 
excessive violence in video and computer games. During Senate hearings 
last year, the case was made for the establishment of an industry 
sponsored ratings board for recreational software in order to give 
parents and consumers accurate information regarding the games and 
educational software they were buying for their children and for 
themselves. The Computer Games Working Group, a coalition of six trade 
associations, parents, pediatricians and academics, enlisted the help of 
Dr. Donald Roberts, Chairman of the Communications Department at 
Stanford University to develop the RSAC rating system. 


RSAC and the Internet

There are many ways in which the RSAC rating system could be used to 
empower parents and consumers with the information they need to make 
choices about the material they and their children see on their computer 
screen. The output of the Internet is vast and would far outstrip any 
one agencys ability to fully review everything on it before it was 
posted on a home page or downloaded onto a hard drive. Through the RSAC 
system, however, many hundreds if not thousands of web sites and home 
pages could be rated and regulated. And, together with the emerging 
technology, such as what SurfWatch has developed, parents could block 
all Internet sites that were not already rated. And of those, they could 
block out any site with a high violence or sexual content or vulgarity 
content. 

Content labeling is essential for the new screening technologies being 
developed for the Internet and television. The software needs code to 
read to enable it to do more than just simply block out entire sites. 
RSAC anticipated this eventuality when we devised display standards for 
the RSAC labels to be used in digital format at the beginning of a piece 
of software.

The screening technology used together with the RSAC rating system would 
not be censorship by government or by an outside agency. It would simply 
be a mechanism for choice. If increasing numbers of parents and 
guardians exercised their choices, then market forces alone would 
encourage web site providers to rate their material and in some cases, 
reduce or withdraw what would be seen to be highly sexual or violent in 
nature.

The RSAC content labeling system is most appropriate for static sites 
such as home pages, documents, games, picture galleries and libraries. 
It would not be able to deal with interactive chat groups or bulletin 
boards as the nature of such sites is highly fluid and instantaneous. In 
this case, however, the new screening software packages, such as 
SurfWatch, could simply deny access to these chat groups. 

Unique Rating System

In the early days of RSACs creation, the founder members decided not to 
develop an age-based rating system. The Working Party frankly 
acknowledged that not all families are the same and instead, looked to 
devise a system which would give parents the information they needed to 
choose the software they thought was appropriate for their children. The 
FDA food labeling system was used as a model, as it provides objective 
and quantifiable measures of various ingredients within a product 
without making a judgment as to who should or should not purchase it. 
The new system would be a content-labeling system which would be as 
objective as possible, open and accessible to the public, non-judgmental 
and regularly reviewed and developed. A methodology was created which 
included an integral algorithm that branches the applicant to a series 
of questions to determine the levels of violence, nudity/sex and 
vulgarity. 

Because of the nature of recreational software, full prior review of 
every title was not a feasible option. Whereas a movie takes two hours 
to view, interactive software can take upwards of one or two hundred 
hours of playing and the viewer may still not have opened all the doors 
or reached every level. In addition, there are an estimated 2,000 new 
titles published each year which would make full prior review virtually 
impossible unless a vast army of reviewers were employed, making the 
system extremely expensive and unwieldy. It was essential that the 
rating system include a self-disclosure questionnaire as the basis for 
reaching the rating levels and descriptors in each category together 
with tough sanctions for any willful misrepresentation by a software 
publisher. 

The three categories of the RSAC rating system are: Violence; 
Nudity/Sex; and Language. Within these categories are four levels: 0-4. 
The higher the level, the greater the objectionable content to be found 
in the software product. In addition, there are brief descriptors that 
give further information about the title, such as: Blood and gore or 
Explicit sexual activity. If a title has no objectionable content it 
receives an All rating, i.e., Suitable for All Audiences. These labels 
are then placed on the front of the boxes or on the opening screen of 
the software. Examples of these rating labels can be seen below:

Checks and balances

It was imperative that the RSAC system had a strongly regulated series 
of controls to ensure that software publishers and other media providers 
were not able to cheat the system. The RSAC application includes a three 
page legal contract that is signed by the producer stating that he or 
she has fully disclosed all the potentially objectionable material 
within the product. The software publisher also agrees to adhere to the 
RSAC regulations regarding the display and use of the trademarked icons 
and logos. Further, the contract lays out stiff penalties for non 
conformance, including fines of up to $10,000, removal of product from 
retail outlets and enforced re-rating. In addition, RSAC regularly 
audits a percentage of all products that have been rated by the RSAC 
system. These spot checks ensure that a software publisher is fully 
aware that their products are closely monitored and reviewed.

Statistics

Since RSACs incorporation in September of last year, over 200 software 
titles have been rated with nearly 80 software companies. It is 
anticipated that some 500 titles will have been rated by the Christmas 
season. The current cost to rate a product with RSAC is $350 with a 
sliding scale for smaller companies who may only pay $25 per title 
depending on their size. Over 500 RSAC Self-Disclosure Questionnaires 
have been distributed to software publishers, the media, schools and 
individual consumers. Over one million RSAC educational postcards are 
being distributed by Wal*Mart and through software companies in their 
software packaging.

Retailers

A key part in making the RSAC system effective is the active involvement 
of major retailers in the scheme. Wal*Mart, the countrys leading 
retailer has announced that they will no longer accept titles unless 
they have been rated. Toys R Us has made a similar statement. Sears and 
Target strongly encourage software publishers to rate their products, 
though they have not, to date, set a time limit after which they will no 
longer accept unrated products. Senator Lieberman has taken a strong 
stance on this issue and together with Senator Kohl, continues to try to 
persuade more retailers to take the Wal*Mart line.
It is our hope that many more of the top retailers in the country will 
announce their requirement of ratings on recreational software before 
the Christmas shopping season.

Ratings and other media

Considerable research has shown that TV violence and images of explicit 
sex have a profound effect on children. In the recent Telecommunications 
Bill debate, Senator Kent Conrad successfully amended the Bill with a 
call to television manufacturers to install Choice Chips inside all 
television sets and for the networks to develop a ratings system to 
empower parents to make real choices about the programs that they and 
their children watch. On the floor of the Senate and in subsequent press 
conferences, Senator Conrad commended the RSAC system as an excellent 
example of what could be achieved in a short period of time. Senator 
Conrad was praised for his steadfast work on a rating system for 
television by both the President and Vice President at the recent 
Families and the Media conference in Nashville. At that conference, 
RSAC offered to work with the Coalition that Senator Conrad has 
developed over the past two years, to help the television networks to 
set up a system by July 1996. 

Conclusion

The Recreational Software Advisory Council is committed to providing 
parents and consumers accurate information about the recreational 
software and other media they purchase for themselves and their 
children. RSAC is opposed to censorship and respects the right of free 
speech and expression.

While we have a number of reservations about the Act as drafted, we 
would like to invite any organization interested in the RSAC system to 
work together with us to find a practical solution to the necessary 
protection of children from objectionable material on the Internet and 
in other media.

Testimony Summary Sheet

1) RSAC is an independent, non for profit organization which provides, 
promotes and administers a content labeling system for recreational 
software and other media.

2) The RSAC system could be adapted to rate Internet home pages, 
individual documents, on-line games, pictures and video. A content 
labeling system is essential for the new screening technologies to work 
effectively. SurfWatch, which has already developed software to block 
certain parts of the Internet, will be able to read the RSAC rating 
labels and provide parents with a way to block objectionable material 
being seen by their children.

3) The ratings for Violence, Nudity/Sex and Language are determined by 
the Self-Disclosure Questionnaire developed by Dr. Donald Roberts, 
Chairman of the Communications Department of Stanford University. 

4) Each rating category has four levels, 0 - 4, which indicate the level 
of objectionable material in the product. In addition, detailed 
descriptors give the parent or consumer further information about the 
software, e.g., Blood and gore; Explicit sexual activity. 

5) RSAC has rated over 200 titles with 80 companies including LucasArts, 
Broderbund, Interplay and id Software, maker of Doom. The cost ranges 
from $25 to $350 per title depending on the gross revenue of the 
company.

6) A series of checks and balances are used to ensure full compliance 
with the RSAC requirements including spot checks, stiff penalties for 
non- disclosure and enforced re-rating of products. 

7) Senator Kent Conrad commended the RSAC system to the Senate last 
month in his successful amendment to the Telecommunications Bill. It 
calls upon the TV networks to develop a similar rating system for 
television linked to Choice Chips .

8) RSAC is committed to providing parents with accurate information 
about the software and other media they and their children view. We are 
opposed to censorship and we respect the right of free speech and 
expression. RSAC invites any interested party to develop a practical 
solution to the problem of protecting children from pornography on the 
Internet.

<title>House CDA Sponsor Calls for Hearings, Go-Slow Approach</title>
<body>
<h2House CDA Sponsor Calls for Hearings, Go-Slow Approach</h2>
<p>
Representative Tim Johnson (D-SD) recently sent the attached letter to Rep.
Jack Fields (R-TX), chairman of the House Subcommittee on
Telecommunications and Finance, urging the subcommittee to carefully
examine the issues raised by the legislation before rushing to enact it. 
<p>
In the letter, Johnson clarifies that he sponsored HR 1004 only to
facilitate a discussion and hearings on the issue.  Johnson writes that
while "it is essential for your committee to consider obscenity,
harassment, and First Amendment concerns as well as over-all enforceability
matters ... it is my hope that you will hold hearings which permit all
points of view to be heard before taking any action on this issue."
<p>
The House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance is currently
drafting legislation to overhaul the Nation's telecommunications laws.  A
modified version of the Exon/Gorton "Communications Decency Act" (S. 314)
was incorporated into similar legislation approved last month by the Senate

HR 1004 is the House counterpart to the Exon/Gorton Communications Decency
Act, which would criminalize the transmission of any content deemed
"obscene, indecent, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or harassing."   Unlike the
Senate version, HR 1004 has not been modified since its introduction.

The Honorable Jack Fields
Chairman 
Subcommittee on Telecommunications 
 and Finance
House Committee on Commerce
2125 Rayburn House Office Building
Washington, DC 20515

Dear Jack:

I am writing to you today relative to legislation which I have sponsored,
HR 1004, a house counterpart to Senator Exon's S. 314, the Communications
Decency Act.  S. 314 was recently incorporated by voice vote into the
Senate Commerce Committee's telecommunications reform legislation.  The
amendment attempts to update the Communications Act of 1934 by providing
users of digital communications the same protections telephone users
currently have against obscene, indecent, or harassing telephone calls.

I want to advise you that I have sponsored HR 1004 simply as a beginning
point for hearings and discussion and not necessarily to propose that this
bill, or any bill for that matter, is necessarily the proper response to
concerns over obscenity. While it appears that the Exon provision as
amended goes a long way to address the liability questions by exempting
companies or entities which merely provide transmission services for the
Internet, I remain concerned that this issue needs a thorough examination
through the hearing process.

It is essential for your committee to consider obscenity, harassment, and
First Amendment concerns as well as over-all enforceability matters.  For
that reason, it is my hope that you will hold hearings which will permit
all points of view to be heard before taking any action on this issue.
Hopefully, you and your committee will have an opportunity to consider this
important issue in a carefully deliberative fashion which will balance
concerns for children and others from unwanted obscene material on the
Internet with free and enhanced use of the Internet. It may very well be
that this balance is best achieved by voluntary means rather than by new
legislation, but I will be appreciative of your willingness to carefully
investigate this complex issue.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely, 
{sig}
Tim Johnson

<title>Sen. Leahy Letter to FBI Director Louis Freeh</title>

<p>
<p>
The Honorable Louis J. Freeh<br>
Federal Bureau of Investigation<br>
J. Edgar Hoover Building<br>
9th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue<br>
Washington, D.C.  20035<br>
<p>
Dear Director Freeh:
<p>
Congress took the important step in the last Congress of passing the "Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act" (CALEA) to ensure that in cases of significant criminal activity, ranging from terrorism to kidnapping, law enforcement would continue to be able to execute court-authorized electronic surveillance.  Our Nation's law enforcement agencies are loosing their capability to use that important tool in the face of new and advanced telecommunications technologies.
<p>
Just as significantly, this new law also brings decisions affecting the privacy of our Nation's telephone system under statutory guidance and into the sunshine.  CALEA requires that law enforcement's demands regarding the number of wiretap orders that telephone companies must be able to service simultaneously, are published in the Federal Register and scrutinized in a public procedure.
<p>
The process set up in CALEA is working.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation recently published in the Federal Register a proposed notice of law enforcement's capacity demands predicated upon an historical baseline of electronic surveillance activity and an analysis of that activity.  The Federal Register notice did not include publication of those two documents.
<p>
Please provide me with copies of those two documents, which I also urge you to release to the public and publish in the Federal Register to ensure the fullest dissemination of the information.
<p>
I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>

<title>Testimony of CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman</title>
<body>
<pre>
      

                               Testimony of

                     Jerry Berman, Executive Director
                    Center for Democracy and Technology

                                Regarding

The "Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act of 1995" 
                                 (S. 892)

                                 before

                       the Senate Judiciary Committee


                              July 24, 1995

Mr. Chairman and Member of the Subcommittee:

My name is Jerry Berman, Executive Director of the Center for Democracy 
and Technology.  The Center is pleased to have opportunity to address 
the subcommittee on one of the critical civil liberties issues of our 
day: the question of the most effective and constitutional means of 
protecting children from inappropriate material on the Internet.  We are 
pleased, therefore, the have the opportunity to offer our views on the 
proposed "Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act of 1995." 
(S. 892)  

The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) is an independent, non-
profit public interest policy organization in Washington, DC.  The 
Center's mission is to develop and implement public policies to protect 
and advance individual liberty and democratic values in new digital 
media. The Center achieves its goals through policy development, public 
education, and coalition building.
        
The Center is also the coordinator of the Interactive Working Group 
(IWG), an ad hoc working group of over 85 organizations from the 
computer and communications industries, and the public interest 
community.  Since January 1995, the IWG has been working to address the 
question of how to protect children from inappropriate material online 
in a manner which is consistent with Constitutional values and continued 
innovation in interactive media.

I.  Broad reach and sweeping impact of the "Protection of Children from
    Computer Pornography Act of 1995."

The "Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act of 1995" 
(S.892) has been presented as a narrowly drawn statute, designed to 
target the "bad actors."  Unfortunately, based on CDT's analysis, the 
proposed statute is in fact strickingly broad.  In some senses, it is 
even more sweeping than the Communications Decency Act. 

A.  The Grassley bill creates broad criminal liability for online
    services providers, video dialtone network operators, full service
    network providers, schools, libraries, private businesses, and many
    content providers
        
Notwithstanding the intent of the drafters, the Grassley bill sweeps a 
number of commercial and noncommercial entities into its ambit.  Covered 
entities include:

*  commercial online service providers,
*  schools,
*  libraries,
*  universities which offer access to the Internet,
*  other public information resources, 
*  small and large businesses which provide their employees with access
   to the Internet.  

In addition, since the bill covers all "electronic communications 
service" providers (see 2(b)(1(B)), S. 892 also threatens criminal 
liability for:

*  video dialtone networks operated by local telephone companies, and
*  full service networks operated by cable television companies.

Included as well would be any commercial or noncommercial provider of 
content which operates its own computer to distribute that content.  As 
a result, all of the individuals and institutions which publish through 
the World Wide Web and operate their own computers attached to the 
Internet would face liability under this bill.  To the extent that a 
content provider -- whether an individual or a large publishing company 
-- operates a computer which makes information available to others, that 
publisher would be subject to the provisions of S. 892.

B.  Broad scienter requirements in S. 892 would force the segration of
    the Internet into a children's network and a separate adult network
       
The scienter requirements in the proposed statute appear to have been 
designed in order to limit the scope of the statute.  However, as 
drafted, the statute is subject to broad, sweeping interpretation when 
applied by criminal courts.  These overly broad scienter requirements 
would force all who provide access to the Internet or other online 
services to create, in effect, separate networks for children and for 
adults.  Such a stark separation would likely be the only way to for 
online service providers and system operators to avoid liability under 
S. 892.

The new proposed (b)(2) of 18 U.S.C. 1464 would criminalize the 
"knowing" transmission of indecent material to minors by any electronic 
communication service provider.  According to one interpretation, the 
application of this knowledge requirement could apply to any provider 
who knows that a specific individual is a minor, and then transmits 
indecent material to that individual.  Or, another interpretation could 
hold that service providers know that minors are on their service and 
that there is indecent material on the Internet.  Thus, service 
providers -- including schools, libraries and private businesses -- 
would be criminally liable for merely providing minors with access to 
the Internet.  Nothing in the statute or relevant case law suggests that 
courts applying this law would be compelled to adopt the former, more 
narrow, interpretation.  Rather, it is perfectly plausible to read the 
proposed (b)(2) as a punishment for any service provider or system 
operator who makes indecent material publicly available to an audience 
that may include minors.  

The threat of a broad interpretation of this new statute would compel 
all who provide access to the Internet to restrict all public discussion 
areas and public information sources from subscribers, unless they prove 
that they are over the age of eighteen.  Under this statute, a service 
provider could not even provide Internet access to a minor with the 
approval of the child's parent.  Since every online service provider 
would have to similarly restrict access to minors, this proposed statute 
would create two separate Internets, one for children and one for 
adults.  Access by a child to the adult network would create criminal 
liability for the service provider.

II.  The vagueness of the "Protection of Children from Computer   
     Pornography Act of 1995" will create a chilling effect on all forms
     of speech on the Internet and great confusion among schools, 
     libraries, businesses, and online service providers who offer 
     access to the Internet.

A.   Application of "willful" standard is unclear in the bill as drafted 
     and will lead to confusion among service providers and users
        
The 'willful' standard also creates the possibility for significant 
confusion, given the widely divergent readings of the 'willful' 
requirement.  In some instances, 'willful' is read as a so-called "tax 
standard," implying that to be convicted one must manifest a voluntary 
and intentional act which is violation of a known legal duty.  Cheek v. 
United States, 111 S.Ct 604 (1991).  However, courts have also found 
that willfulness means nothing more than a person acted knowingly and 
deliberately.  United States v. Peltz, 433 F.2d 48, 54-055 (2d 
Cir.1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 955 (1971).  The drafters of the Model 
Penal Code define willful as merely knowing action,  and do not require 
specific intent to violate a known legal duty.   Recent Supreme Court 
jurisprudence in the area of money laundering, on the other hand, has 
required that the defendant's actions demonstrate knowledge that his or 
her conduct is, in fact, a violation of the law.  United States v. 
Ratzlaf, 114 S.Ct 655 (1994).  

A broad reading of "willful," requiring primarily purposive action 
leading to a minor's access to indecency, but not knowledge of the fact 
that such actions constituted violations of the law, would subject many 
service providers to liability under  1464.  A more narrow reading of 
this requirement, could diminish the overreaching impact of the statute, 
however, such an interpretation is by no means guaranteed.  While 
Ratzlaf may offer some support in this regard, the Court also noted that 
" 'Willful,' ... is a 'word of many meanings,' and 'its construction' 
[is] often ... influenced by its content.' " Id. at 659 (citations 
omitted).  The context was supplied, in part, by the statute in 
question, which had previously construed "willful" as knowing violation 
of a known legal duty. Id.  No such context is available in 18 U.S.C.  
1464 to aid a court in intepretation.  
        
Confusion as to providers legal duty will create a tremendous chilling 
effect on all online communications.  In order to minimize their risk, 
service providers will be forced to adopt rules governing their users 
behavior that are likely to be highly restrictive.


B.  Heavy-handed content regulation will squander the democratic
    potential of interactive media
        
As the popularity and accessibility of the Internet and commercial 
online services grows, and as the medium becomes easier to use, the 
political uses of the net have flourished.  Political discourse is 
facilitated by a variety of different communications techniques possible 
online, including newsgroups, mailing list discussion groups, chat 
sessions, and a host of electronic publishing capabilities.  Any 
regulation creating criminal penalties for communication of indecent 
material would have a substantial chilling effect on all who use 
interactive media.  Such a chilling effect would severely inhibit the 
growth of the Internet as a political forum.  
        
Political groups left,  right,  and center are using the Internet to 
communicate, to organize, and to advocate their own views.  Advocacy 
organizations have found World Wide Web services are critical to 
political education activities, and an increasing number of grass roots 
and community groups are coming to rely on the Internet to keep in touch 
with members and constituents.  In fact, even some Senators offices are 
using the World Wide Web to communicate with and solicit feedback from 
constituents.   As a nation we should be encouraging political discourse 
in this new medium, because of its potential to raise the level of 
political discussion beyond the sound bite and to involve more citizens 
in the political process.  One aspect of encouraging political discourse 
in interactive media is to assure all users that their First Amendment 
and privacy rights will be respected fully.
        
Indeed, the Internet and other online services are fast becoming a new 
public forum for political discourse for American citizens.  In order to 
preserve the freedom and openness of this new political arena, it is 
critical to avoid creating a chilling effect on individual expression.

III.  The "Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act of 
      1995" is unconstitutional under the First Amendment for failure to 
      adopt the least restrictive means
       
The proposed statute extends indecency restrictions enacted to apply to 
the broadcast radio and television media to new interactive 
communications media such as the Internet, commercial online services, 
and electronic bulletin board systems.  Though indecency restrictions 
have been applied to broadcasting for some time, reflexive extension of 
the same restrictions to new interactive communications media is simply 
unconstitutional.  The Supreme Court has long held that "each medium of 
expression presents special First Amendment problems."  In light of the 
substantial control that users and parents have over content that enters 
their homes via interactive media, government restrictions on indecency 
as proposed by the Grassley bill are unconstitutional.

A.   Censorship of indecent, but not obscene, communications for the 
     purpose of protecting minors must employ the least restrictive 
     means available to accomplish their goal
        
Indecent communications are protected by the First Amendment, unlike 
obscenity which is altogether unprotected.  Sable Communications of 
California v. FCC, 492 US 115; 109 S.Ct. 2829; 106 L.Ed. 2d 93 (1989). 
Indecent communications, which do not rise to the level of obscenity,  
can only be limited in order to serve a compelling state purpose and 
must be done using the least restrictive means possible.  Id. at 125.  
The Sable court found that the protection of minors from access to 
indecent material is a compelling state purpose, but that "it is not 
enough that the Government's ends are compelling; the means must be 
carefully tailored to achieve those ends." Id.   
        
As a threshold matter, the Sable court found that the constitutional 
basis for upholding indecency regulations in broadcast media articulated 
in Pacifica Foundation v. FCC, 438 US 726, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 57 L.Ed. 2d 
1073 (1978), were inapplicable in any other media besides over-the-air 
broadcasting.   492 U.S. at 127.  Pacifica accepted that the FCC had 
authority to enforce content regulation based on the dual finding that 
1) radio was a "uniquely pervasive medium"  that intruded (dirty words 
and all) into peoples homes, and 2) the only way to protect children 
from exposure to objectionable content was to keep it off the air 
altogether.   Sable rejects this finding of "pervasiveness" as 
"emphatically narrow" and irrelevant to other media such as telephone 
audiotext services. 492 U.S. at 127
        
Thus, the Sable "least restrictive means" standard became the test by 
which all regulations on access to constitutionally protected indecent 
material were judged.  Nearly ten years of litigation along with 
adjustment of the statute and regulation were required before the 
current statute was found constitutional under this standard.  See Dial 
Information Services v. Thornburg, 938 F.2d 1535 (2d Cir., 1991)(finding 
FCC regulations implementing  223(b) constitutional).  During the 
course of the dispute over the application of  223 to audiotext 
services, courts considered and rejected a number of means by which 
carriers were required to shield minors from access to indecent 
information.  First, time channeling rules, requiring that services only 
be accessible during hours when children were asleep, were found to 
violate the First Amendment because they had the effect of denying 
access to adults as well as children.  Carlin Communications v. FCC, 749 
F.2d 113, 121 (2d Cir. 1984) (Carlin I).  Next, the courts rejected a 
requirement that carriers provide access to indecent services only once 
customers entered access codes or passwords, which were to be issued 
after verification that the customer was over 18.  Carlin Communications 
v. FCC, 787 F.2d 846 (2d Cir. 1986)(Carlin II).
        
The finding of the Dial court, approving the constitutionality of  223 
and associated regulations depended on the legislative determination 
that the telephone company blocking of service pending age verification 
or use of a credit card are the only means to enable parents to restrict 
their children from access to indecent audiotext services.   

B.  Background on dial-a-porn rules: lack of user control leads to 
    indecency restrictions
        
As was the case for broadcast indecency restrictions considered in 
Pacifica, the dial-a-porn restrictions were only found constitutional 
because of the uniquely intrusive and uncontrollable nature of the 
audiotext services.  A key legislative motivation for imposing these 
rules during the 1980s was that indecent information available through 
audiotext services in the telephone system were openly available to 
children in such a way that it was difficult for parents to control 
access by their children.  The views of Congressman Bliley recounts the 
prevailing view of the need for the legislation: "It constitutes an 
attractive nuisance in every home in America where children are present. 
There is no completely effective way to prevent children from being 
exposed to "indecent" or "obscene" dial-a-porn so long as it is lawfully 
and commercially marketed. . . ."  Bliley continues:

"Telephones are precisely like radio and television because of their 
easy accessibility to children and the virtual impossibility for parents 
to monitor their use . . . . [D]ial-a-porn is presently in the home 
whether the homeowner wants it or not.  Today one cannot have telephone 
service in the privacy of one's family environment without being 
required to [have] dial-a-porn with it. Families with children must give 
up telephone service to be "left alone" from exposure of their children 
to this intruder." 
        
The current statute and Federal Communications Commission regulations 
promulgated thereunder were found constitutional only after nearly ten 
years of litigation and efforts by Congress and the Commission to bring 
the statute within constitutionally acceptable bounds. Indecency 
restrictions applied to interactive media would require a wholesale 
review of the constitutionality as applied to new media such as online 
services and the Internet.  Interactive media operates in such a 
different manner that the constitutional issues must be considered 
afresh given the new factual backdrop.

C.  Reliance on government censorship to restrict access to indecency 
    fails to take into account the fact that interactive media offers 
    parents a much greater degree of control then broadcast services or 
    900 number services.
        
Indecency restrictions in interactive media would presumably be 
motivated by the same goal of protecting minors as the existing statute.   
However, the means adopted for achieving the goal are impermissible 
under the First Amendment because they are not the least restrictive 
means of accomplishing the legitimate government purpose.  Interactive 
media is materially different than analog telephone and audiotext 
technology in that it offers users the ability to exercise control over 
precisely what information one accesses.  Given the dramatic difference 
between telephone technology and interactive services such as the 
Internet and other interactive media, we believe that blocking by the 
carrier as demanded by  223 would not meet the "least restrictive 
means" test.  

Just as the Sable court found broadcast indecency regulations 
inapplicable to the telephone system because of differences in the 
medium, regulations designed for audiotext services in the telephone 
system are constitutionally inapplicable to new interactive media.  
Indeed, indecency restrictions on material transport by US Mail have 
also been struck down by the Supreme Court precisely because "the 
receipt of mail is far less intrusive and uncontrollable"  than 
broadcast information that was the subject of the Pacifica case.
        
Technologies already exist that enable users to access certain 
information based on a variety of characteristics, or, to exclude 
certain types of information from access.   With such filtering 
technology, users, instead of the government or network operators, can 
exercise control over the information content that they receive in an 
interactive network environment.  User control could be exercised in two 
ways.  First, one could screen out all messages or programs based on 
information in the header.  If a parent wanted to prevent a child from 
seeing a particular movie or from participating in a particular online 
discussion group, then the computer or other information appliance used 
by the child could be set by the parent to screen out the objectionable 
content.  Such features can often be protected with passwords which 
would be assigned, for example, by the responsible adults in the house.  
Second, the same systems can be used to enable blocking of content based 
on third-party rating systems.  
        
Given the flexibility of interactive technology, we need not rely on 
just one rating system.  In fact, a single rating system or a single set 
of filters would merely replace a single government censor with a single 
private censor, with no real gain for the free flow of information.  
Properly implemented, interactive media can accommodate multiple 
filtering systems, giving users and parents the opportunity to select 
and block information based on a true diversity of criteria.  The 
national Parent Teachers Association or different religious 
organizations could set up rating systems which would be available on 
the network to those who desired them.  Rather than relying on the 
judgment of the government, or of the service provider, viewers can 
limit access to content based on the judgment of a group whose values 
they share.
        
Interactive media can enable individuals and parents to prevent 
themselves or their children from using their PCs or TVs to access 
certain kinds of content.  With such control mechanisms within the 
practical reach of parents, the governmental purpose generally cited for 
indecency regulations -- the protection of children -- could be 
accomplished without government content restrictions.  In particular, 
the reasoning of Pacifica (intrusion of the indecent message into homes) 
and Sable (inability of parents to exercise control) would no longer 
justify most content regulation.  
        
To date, Congress has made no finding that a law such as that proposed 
by Senator Grassley is the "least restrictive means" to protect children 
from indecent material.  Indeed, we believe that parental empowerment 
technology and public education would be far more effective and far less 
restrictive of adult's right to receive indecent material.  The very 
fact that the Grassley bill proposes that the Justice Department study 
blocking and filtering technology  suggests that the issue should be 
investigated further before Congress can be said to have concluded that 
it has found the "least restrictive means" to protect children.

IV.  Criminalizing behavior of service providers is not an effective 
     means of protecting children from indecent material

A.  Regulating decentralized interactive media following the pattern of
    old-style, centralized communications media such as broadcasting is
    impractical
        
The Internet and other interactive communications media are 
fundamentally decentralized media.  Unlike centralized broadcast radio 
and television services, there are no central control points through 
which either a single network operator or government censors can control 
particular content.  On the Internet there are literally millions of 
speakers and publishers.  This proliferation of individual speakers 
stands in sharp contrast to broadcast television or even cable 
television, where one may count five, ten, or perhaps one hundred 
speakers, each of whom controls a channel.  Federal broadcast content 
regulators can direct their regulations at the operators of a particular 
channel in order to enforce their regulations.  However, content control 
on the Internet would have to be targeted at each and every one of the 
millions of US and international citizens that speak daily online.  Any 
attempt to impose centralized content control in a bureaucratic manner 
on this fundamentally decentralized medium is bound to stifle the growth 
of the medium, squander the democratic potential of the Internet, and 
may even cut the United States off from the growing global information 
infrastructure.
        
As a decentralized medium, the Internet and other interactive services 
have flourished in a largely unregulated environment.  Indeed, recent 
Congressional decisions to commercialize the Internet have lead to a 
tremendous increase in the number of users who have access to the 
Internet and great innovations such as the World Wide Web.  Indeed, the 
innovative, entrepreneurial Internet marketplace has even produced a 
variety of software and services that help protect children from 
inappropriate material online.  Imposition of content regulations would 
seriously retard the growth of the Internet marketplace.  What's more, 
content control is unlikely to be effective in protecting children.

B.  The global nature of the Internet makes control by the user or
    parent the only effective means of restricting access to indecent 
    material
         
While the vast majority of content on the Internet is intended for 
legitimate educational, cultural, political, or entertainment value, 
some material on the Internet may not be appropriate for children. 
Moreover, much of this material is accessible from the United States but 
transmitted from other countries, beyond the practical reach of U.S. 
law.  In order to protect children we must rely on powerful blocking and 
filtering technology to empower parents to make choices about the 
material which their children can access.
        
Entrepreneurial effort has already produced blocking and filtering 
products for families and schools.  The vast majority of the content on 
the Internet is labeled or identified in some manner.  If information is 
not labeled, intended users cannot find it.  Therefore, the inherent 
power of computer software allows the creation of computer programs 
which enable parents to block material from the reach of their children 
automatically, without the need for constant parental supervision.  
Affordable software such as SurfWatch and NetNanny already enable 
parents to allow their children to "surf the net" freely, but keep them 
away from objectionable material.  The Netscape Proxy Server, WEBTrack, 
and the Apple Communications Server can be installed in schools or other 
institutions to open their institutions to the Internet without allowing 
their students to have access to objectionable sites.
        
The global and decentralized nature of interactive media requires new 
approaches to child protection.  Censorship of centralized media such as 
radio and television may be effective at keeping the "seven dirty words" 
off the airwaves.  However, on the Internet, with hundreds of thousands 
of content creators all over the world, US law, no matter how tough, 
will never be able to keep offensive material out of the reach of kids.
        
Industry-wide initiatives are developing standard label and blocking 
conventions to increase the effectiveness of blocking.  Microsoft, 
Netscape and Progressive Networks have announced efforts to develop 
blocking and label conventions.  The Internet technical standards 
developers are now considering a proposal called "KidCode", which would 
establish voluntary labeling systems that identify Internet information 
which is inappropriate for children.  The flexibility of interactive 
media allows multiple rating systems to co-exist so that individuals and 
families can chose a rating system that best reflects their own values.
        
Parental choice assures full respect for the free speech rights in 
interactive media.  Relying on parents, not the government, to make 
choices about the content that they and their families receive assures 
maximum respect for First Amendment rights of adults to receive and 
transmit constitutionally-protected material, and allows families, not 
federal bureaucrats, to determine what information is most consistent 
with their own moral values.

V.      Conclusion
        
Again, I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear and offer the 
views of the Center for Democracy and Technology on this very important 
issue.  We look forward to working with you toward a resolution of this 
issue which empowers parents, protects children, and preserves full 
First Amendment freedoms in new, interactive communciations media.

<b>MEMORANDUM</b>
<p>
TO:             Interested Persons<br>
FROM:   James X. Dempsey<br>
RE:             Capacity Requirements under CALEA
<p>
<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
The FBI has issued a notice  of proposed capacity requirements for telecommunications carriers under the 1994 Communications Assistance 
for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, sometimes referred to as the "digital telephony" law).  The notice is intended to set forth "the combined number of 
simultaneous pen register, trap and trace, and communication interceptions that law enforcement may conduct" four years from now.  At that time, 
under the law, telecommunications carriers are required to ensure that their systems can accommodate the stated level of electronic  surveillance activity.  The federal government is required to pay for any capacity installed to meet 
law enforcement requirements. 
<p>
 The FBI proposes to require telephone companies and other telecommunications common carriers to establish maximum surveillance 
capacities equal to 1.0% of "engineered capacity" in some densely populated urban areas, falling off to 0.5% in other cities and 0.25% in the rest of 
the country.  
<p>
Despite CALEA's intent of ensuring maximum industry and public input into a decision that is vitally important for law enforcement, privacy and 
technology, the FBI's notice of proposed capacity requirements is lacking in key details.  (1) "Engineered capacity" is not clearly defined.  (2) The notice does not include the data on which the projection of law enforcement needs was based.  (3) While the notice sets different capacity requirements for different geographic areas, it does not indicate what those areas are.   (4) Requirements are stated in percentage terms, without a clear indication how those percentages would translate into numbers of intercepts.
<p>
An administrative decision based on a notice that lacks supporting data may be vulnerable to judicial challenge under the Administrative Procedure Act.   Legal vulnerability aside however, decisions under CALEA that are reflected only in cryptic notices and that are based on information not disclosed to the public are likely to generate more concern and more suspicion about 
government surveillance practices.  
<p>
Interested parties have until November 15 to file written comments with the FBI, although that deadline may be extended. 
<p>
<b>What This is NOT About</b>
<p>
The FBI is not seeking authority to randomly wiretap any percentage of telephones.  CALEA did not change the legal requirement that law 
enforcement obtain a court order for wiretaps and other forms of electronic surveillance.  
 <p>
<b>One Intercept per 100 Lines or per 100 Lines in Use?</b>
 <p>
 Engineered capacity was defined in the FBI's notice as "the maximum number of subscribers that can be served by that equipment."  On first 
reading the notice, I and others, including some in industry, assumed that engineered capacity was equal to the number of installed lines served by a 
particular piece of equipment, such as a switch.  Subsequently, the FBI has indicated informally  that it meant to define engineered capacity as the 
maximum number of subscribers that can be served "simultaneously" by a piece of equipment.  The FBI has pointed out that most systems can handle only a percentage of installed lines at one time.  The FBI has said that some switches have an engineered capacity equal to 10% of the total number of 
installed lines.  With that understanding of engineered capacity, the maximum surveillance capacity of 1% is equal to 0.1% of lines 
installed.   
<p>        
Under the latest interpretation, for example, assuming New York City has 2,000,000 telephone lines (probably a fair estimate considering residential, business, fax, modem, cellular, etc.), and assuming that switches in New York can handle 10% of those lines simultaneously, the notice would require the telephone companies in New York City to ensure that they could service 
2000 law enforcement interceptions simultaneously. 
 <p>
It seems, however, that even with the FBI's clarification, the approach taken in the notice may be oversimplified.  A generalized definition of engineered capacity may be impossible.  Part of the difficulty here may be due to the FBI's 
decision to express its projected needs in terms of a percentage, without use of absolute numbers. 
<p>    
<b>Did Law Enforcement Used to Have 100% Capacity?</b>
<p>
It is sort of true that in the pre-digital world the FBI had the capacity to monitor 100% of calls.   But the point is that law enforcement never needed to use but a tiny fraction of the capacity it had.  CALEA is based on law 
enforcement needs.  The existence of nearly 100% capacity in the old environment was due to features inherent in the system, which cost nothing.  As those features are disappearing, Congress has imposed on the carriers an obligation to build in new features based on demonstrated law 
enforcement needs.
<p>
The concern now is that law enforcement has not demonstrated what its needs for the future will be.
<p>
<b>Does Law Enforcement Intend to Increase the Number 
of Wiretaps?</b>
<p>
On November 2, both Deputy Attorney General Gorelick and FBI Director Freeh said, "There is no intention to expand the number of wiretaps or the 
extent of wiretapping."  This statement cannot be literally true, of course, since the number of wiretaps has increased yearly in recent years (18% 
from 1993 to 1994, 43% since 1984) and would be expected to continue to increase, with or without CALEA.  Moreover, the Gorelick and Freeh 
statements referred, perhaps colloquially, to "wiretaps," when the largest rate of growth in government surveillance has been in the area of call identifying information captured through pen registers and trap and trace devices.  Justice Department agencies alone in-creased their use of such techniques by 45.5% from 1992 to 1993.
<p>
Indeed, the deployment of advanced communications technologies was expected to accelerate these trends, again regardless of CALEA.  As the FBI said in its authorization and budget submission for fiscal year 1992, long 
before CALEA was adopted, "In the long term, digital telephone technology will enhance the FBI's ability to collect, share and analyze information.  Many of these enhancements will come without any FBI development effort, driven by consumer demand."
<p>
<b>The FBI's Notice Lacks Key Information</b>
<p>
At an important level, the question now is not whether the FBI notice covers one line per 100 or 1 per 100 in use.  The capacity notice is supposed to be based on a calculation of future surveillance "needs."  The question that must be answered now is what level of future intercept capacity is supported by the data on current usage and projections from those data.  In other words, how many communications interceptions, pen registers and trap and trace devices does law enforcement expect will be needed four years from now?   
<p>
<ol>
<li>The FBI's notice states that the proposed capacity requirements were based on a "historical baseline of electronic surveillance activity," 
derived from reports from telecommunications carriers, law enforcement agencies, and other government entities.  This data has never been 
collected before.  It provides a critical basis on which to evaluate the proposed requirements.  Yet the notice does not disclose the baseline data.  Therefore, carriers, privacy organizations and the public have no way of knowing whether the FBI's projections of need are appropriate.  Publication of much of this statistical data of surveillance activity would in no way jeopardize law enforce-ment's future operations, yet it is critical to a reasonable public assessment of the need that the FBI is asserting.  
<p>
<li>The notice states that capacity requirements will be based on geographic area, and that each geographic area in the country will be assigned to one of three "distinct" categories.  While this may or may not be appropriate from a technological standpoint, the notice fails to adequately inform interested parties of the nature of the proposal by failing to indicate what the geographic areas will be.  We are told that they are called Category I, II and III.  We are also told that "only a few of the most densely populated areas" are grouped in Category I.  But we are not told what locations fall in Category I 
or II or III.
<p>
Will Category I include, for example, any areas in the Midwest, so that carriers serving the Midwest might know how they are affected?  (They should not find out in private communications.) Does the designation of geographic areas match the technical considerations of switch coverage?  How does the designation of geographic areas match the baseline and the projections from it?  There is no basis on which these questions can be addressed.
<p>
<li>Other concerns could be raised, but there is no way to evaluate them, given the lack of data in the notice.  
</ol>
<p>
The maximum capacity requirement of 1.0% of engineered capacity for Category I areas seems high, especially as a matter of simultaneous capacity, but it may not be.  All courts nationwide, state and federal, issued about 1500 
call content intercept orders in 1994 (Title III's and FISA's).   That number has been increasing  yearly.  In 1993, U.S. Justice Department components alone obtained about 5500 pen register and trap and trace orders covering the facilities of 11,907 persons.  Those numbers, too, have been increasing yearly, and do not include state and local agencies.   
<p>
Still, without the baseline data, it is hard to understand how the FBI derived a projected need for 2000 simultaneous intercepts in New York City alone, assuming New York is a Category I area with 2,000,000 access lines.
<p>
It appears that the FBI has lumped together pen register, trap and trace and 
call content interceptions, setting a single capacity requirement for all three types of surveillance activity, even though they may pose different technical solutions.  Indeed, CALEA treats call identifying information separately from call content and sets different capability requirements for them.  Why were they not treated separately in the capacity notice?  
<p>
In its projections, did the FBI assume that some percentage of investigative 
interests now handled by subpoena for stored transactional data would in the future be handled contemporaneously, thus increasing the amount of real-time monitoring?
<p>
<b>More Information is Needed</b>
<p>
For the public to evaluate better the FBI proposal, the FBI should release promptly two additional categories of information:
<p><ol>
<li>The "historical baseline of electronic surveillance activity" and the four year projections based on it.        For purposes of improving public trust in the process of setting capacity requirements, it may not be necessary to release 
this information down to the switch level.  At least, though, the baseline data and projections from it should be made available on a city by 
city, state by state basis.
<p>
<li>The names of the geographic areas proposed to be included in Category I and those proposed to be in Category II.  (The remainder of the country, of course, will be Category III.)  By issuing these designations now, the FBI is not 
bound by them; based upon the comments submitted and other information it collects, the Bureau may revise these designations in it final notice.  But 
during the comment period, the proposed designations should be available.</ol>
<p>
How could this be accomplished?  The FBI could issue a supplemental notice in the Federal Register containing the foregoing information, simultaneously extending the comment period.  While this results in some short-term delay in the process, it would produce more informed comments, help avoid public challenges to the capacity requirements, and produce a better result. Indeed, it might shorten the time it takes the FBI to respond to the comments and produce the final notice, since the comments would be more focused. 
 <p>
<b>Adequacy of Notice Under Administrative Procedure Act</b>
<p>
 More research would have to be undertaken, but there appears to be at this point serious grounds for concern that the notice fails to satisfy the Administrative Procedure Act.  While an agency need not publish all the data on which a proposed rule is based, "[v]alid notice must provide sufficient information to adequately disclose an agency's reasons and bases for formulating a proposed rule."  3 Stein, Mitchel, & Mezines, Administrative Law, sec. 15.03[2] (1995).
<p>
<b>Background on CALEA</b>
<p>
CALEA (Public Law 103-414) was enacted in 1994 in response to concerns that new and emerging telecommunications services and technologies were 
interfering with law enforcement's ability to carry out electronic surveillance.  The law requires telecommunications common carriers to design their equipment (and in some cases retrofit existing equipment) to ensure that they can expeditiously isolate and intercept all the communications of a particular target.  The law responds to the growth of digital and fiber optic transmission modes, the increasing computerization of call routing, the widespread use of services such as call-forwarding, and other concerns.
<p>
The law contemplates a cooperative effort between industry and law enforcement, with public oversight by privacy and consumer advocates and other interested members of the public.         CALEA established a series of procedural mechanisms intended to provide telecommunications carriers, 
privacy organizations and members of the public opportunities for input into the implementation of the statute's requirements.  The first of these opportunities for public oversight and involvement is the law's requirement that the capacity requirements be established through a process of 
notice and comment rulemaking.
<p>
<b>CALEA is Working</b>
<p>
It is important to recognize that the current controversy is in a way precisely what Congress intended.  Before CALEA, decisions about how to accommodate law enforcement interceptions were made solely in private negotiations between law enforcement and the telecommunications industry.  
The FBI and the industry had created a committee to develop solutions to meet law enforcement's stated needs.  All participants in those meetings 
were required to sign non-disclosure agreements. 
<p>
In adopting CALEA, Congress expressed a judgment that decisions about designing telecommunications systems to accommodate government surveillance should be made with maximum public knowledge and involvement.  Congress, recognizing that it could not resolve the digital issues in one piece of legislation, created a process that required the FBI to make its case at each step in the process and created opportunities in more than one forum -- the Congress, the FCC, the courts -- in which the 
industry and the public could challenge the FBI to make its case.  That process is just beginning.

<title>Summary of The Medical Records Confidentiality Act of 1995</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
<p>
<center><h3>THE MEDICAL RECORDS CONFIDENTIALITY ACT OF 1995</h3></center>
<p>
The purpose of the Medical Records Confidentiality Act of 1995 is to establish uniform privacy protection for personally identifiable health information.  No comprehensive protection currently exists at the federal level to guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of such information, and existing state laws are incomplete and inadequate.  Under this bill, personally identifiable health information is ensured strong and consistent privacy safeguards  whether the information is in paper or electronic form.
<p>
<b>TITLE  I - INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHTS</b>
<p>
This title requires health information trustees (defined as health care providers, health care plans, and others who create, receive or use health information), to allow individuals access to any health information pertaining to the individual and to give individuals the opportunity to correct such information.  Trustees must provide clear written notice to all individuals of the right to access their personally identifiable health information.  The bill also requires that trustees develop safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the personally identifiable health information they maintain.    
<p>
<b>TITLE II - RESTRICTIONS ON USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION </b>
<p>	
This title establishes a system in which an individual's personally identifiable health information may not be disclosed without the individual's permission except in limited circumstances (described below).
<p>
<ul><b>Disclosures Requiring Consent:</b></ul>
<p>
This title requires that trustees obtain an individual's authorization to disclose personally identifiable health information for purposes of payment or treatment.  In addition, this title allows personally identifiable health information to be disclosed to an individual's next of kin, and the individual's name or general health status to be disclosed for directory information, as long as the individual has not objected to such disclosure.  
<p>
<ul><b>Exceptions To Consent:</b></ul>
<p>
Personally identifiable health information may be disclosed, without the individual's consent, in the following situations:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Emergency Circumstances:</b> Personally identifiable health information may be disclosed in emergency circumstances when necessary to protect the health or safety of an individual from serious, imminent harm.
<p>
<li><b>Oversight:</b> The bill provides for broad disclosure of personally identifiable health information for use in any public entity investigation or enforcement of health care fraud or abuse.  This information, however, may not be used against the individual in any action unrelated to the fraud or abuse.
<p>
<li><b>Public Health:</b> Personally identifiable health information may be disclosed to a public health authority for use in legally authorized disease or injury reports, public health surveillance, or public health investigations or interventions.
<p>
<li><b>Health Research:</b> Personally identifiable health information may be disclosed to a health researcher only if a certified institutional review board (IRB) determines the information is necessary for the research project.  
<p>
<li><b>Judicial and Administrative Purposes: </b>Where required by the Federal Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure, personally identifiable health information may be disclosed in cases in which an individual has placed his or her health condition at issue in a lawsuit.  
<p>
<li><b>Non-Law Enforcement Subpoenas:</b> Personally identifiable health information may be disclosed in response to a subpoena that has been issued in a civil lawsuit.  The bill establishes a set of access requirements that the person requesting the subpoena must follow, and provides an opportunity for the individual who is the subject of the information to challenge the subpoena.  
<p>
<li><b>Law Enforcement:</b>Personally identifiable health information may be disclosed to a law enforcement authority pursuant to a subpoena or warrant where probable cause to believe that such information is relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry has been demonstrated.  The bill provides procedures for an individual who is the subject of the information to challenge the subpoena or warrant.
<p>
<li><b>Certified Health Information Services:</b> Personally identifiable health information may be disclosed to a certified health information service for the purposes of removal of personal identifiers from the information and for the subsequent creation of nonidentifiable health information.  
</ul><p>
<p>
<b>TITLES III & IV - REMEDIES AND PREEMPTION</b>
<p><ul>
<li><b>Remedies :</b> The bill creates a private right of action for violations of this Act, and provides for civil and criminal penalties.  
<p>
<li><b>Preemption:</b> In general, the bill preempts State law.  Exceptions exist in certain limited cases where the state or federal law may provide greater privacy protection.

Dear Senator Pressler, Senator Hollings, Representative Bliley, and Representative Dignell:
<p>
For the past year, Congress has struggled with the question of how best to protect children from inappropriate material online.  As the telecommunications conferees work to reconcile competing approaches to this issue we urge a consensus policy that empowers families, places liability on creators of illegal content instead of passive service providers, and avoids constitutionally suspect new laws that will only delay enforcement.  We write as a broad coalition of representatives from the online service, computer hardware and software, and telecommunications and electronic industries, the advertising industry, newspaper and library associations, and public interest organizations, who believe that the interests of children, free expression, and the continued viability of the Internet and interactive media can best be served by combining a deregulatory approach to encourage the development of parental empowerment technology along with vigorous enforcement of criminal laws that are crafted according to settled constitutional principles.
<p>
A comprehensive and effective policy approach to this issue should be based on the following principles:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Parental Empowerment:</b> Maximum reliance on, and encouragement of, private   sector innovation to produce technologies that enable parents, not government regulators, to choose what is best for their own children.
<p>
<li><b>No vicarious liability: </b> Due to the tremendous flow of information through  both public and private networks, holding service providers, systems, access software providers,  or any other third parties liable for the content of illegal messages created by persons not under their authority or control will be ineffective at protecting children as well as a threat to the privacy of users. Groups such as the United States Chamber of Commerce have expressedconcern on this issue, as well.
<p>
<li><b>Enforceable, narrowly tailored, and constitutionally sound criminal laws:</b>  Any new criminal laws should be focused on bad actors and based on constitutionally sound standards. Existing proposals, which rely on the vague and untested indecency standard, do not fall into such a category.
<p>
<li><b>Uniform national policy:</b>  Given the national, and even global, nature of  online services, uniform national rules governing liability are essential.  Permitting state regulation of content in interactive media would force  service providers and systems to conform to inconsistent and contradictory regulations and undermine the national interest.
</ul><p>
Recognizing the power of interactive technology to help solve the problem of protecting children, the House passed the Cox-Wyden-White bill on a 420-4 vote in order to encourage the market to provide parents screening and filtering options to protect minors.  Even since the Congress began considering this issue this year, great advances have been made in parental empowerment technologies.  Thus, the Interactive Working Group, with the support of its members, would welcome the opportunity to demonstrate these technologies as well as to brief the conferees on additional cooperative efforts now underway in the private sector.  Relying on parents, not the government, to make choices about the content that they and their families receive assures maximum respect for First Amendment rights of adults to receive and transmit constitutionally-protected material, and allows families, not bureaucrats, to determine what information is most consistent with their own moral values.
<p>
Recent FBI child pornography arrests demonstrate that vigorous law enforcement efforts are already working to punish illegal behavior online.  We would welcome the opportunity to brief you on ongoing efforts to assist law enforcement in cases where criminal activity has occurred.  To the extent new criminal laws are needed, they must be drafted in a constitutionally sound manner, both to avoid enforcement delays and to assure respect for the free speech and privacy rights of Internet users.  We believe it is possible to craft a criminal statute that punishes those who provide truly harmful material to children in a manner that both targets the serious offenses about which some conservative family groups are most concerned, and that also will withstand constitutional scrutiny.  In particular, rather than relying on the vague and constitutionally suspect "indecency" standard, Congress should instead consider the "harmful to minors" standard within the framework of Title 18 of the United Sates Code. This standard is used in numerous state statutes and has been found constitutional by the United States Supreme Court.  
<p>
We look forward to working with all of you in an effort to identify a solution to this problem that assures maximum protection for children, while relying on the innovative energy of the high technology market to meet evolving needs of parents online.
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>

<title>Summary of S. 1587 - Encryption Legislation</title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>
        ENCRYPTED COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT OF 1996
        Summary
     
     SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.  The Act may be cited as the "Encrypted 
     Communications Privacy Act of 1996."
     
     SEC. 2.  PURPOSE.  The Act would ensure that Americans have the 
     maximum possible choice in encryption methods to protect the security, 
     confidentiality and privacy of their lawful wire and electronic 
     communications.  For those Americans who choose an encryption method 
     in which another person, called a "key holder," is voluntarily 
     entrusted with the decryption key, the Act would establish privacy 
     standards for the key holder, and procedures for law enforcement 
     officers to follow to obtain assistance from the key holder in 
     decrypting encrypted communications. 
     
     SEC. 3.  FINDINGS.  The Act enumerates fifteen congressional findings, 
     including that a secure, private and trusted national and global 
     information infrastructure is essential to promote citizens' privacy 
     and meet the needs of both American citizens and businesses, that 
     encryption technology widely available worldwide can help meet those 
     needs, that Americans should be free to use, and American businesses 
     free to compete and sell, encryption technology, programs and 
     products, and that there is a need to develop a national encryption 
     policy to advance the global information infrastructure and preserve 
     Americans' right to privacy and the Nation's public safety and 
     national security.
     
     SEC. 4.  FREEDOM TO USE ENCRYPTION.  
     
        (a) Lawful Use of Encryption.  The Act legislatively confirms 
     current practice in the United States that any person in this country 
     may lawfully use any encryption method, regardless of encryption 
     algorithm, key length or implementation selected. The Act thereby 
     prohibits any government-mandated use of any particular encryption 
     system, such as a key escrow encryption system.
     
        The Act further makes lawful the use of any encryption method by 
     United States persons in a foreign country. This provision is 
     consistent with, though broader than, the Department of State's new 
     personal use exemption published in the Federal Register on February 
     16, 1996, that permits the export of cryptographic products by U.S. 
     citizens and permanent residents who have the need to temporarily 
     export the cryptographic products when leaving the U.S. for brief 
     periods of time. For example, under this new exemption, U.S. citizens 
     traveling abroad will be able to take their laptop computers 
     containing copies of Lotus Notes software, many versions of which 
     contain an encryption program otherwise not exportable.
     
        (b) General Constructions.  Nothing in the Act is to be construed 
     to require the use of encryption, a key escrow encryption system, or a 
     key holder if a person chooses to use a key escrow encryption system.
     
     SEC. 5.  ENCRYPTED WIRE AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS.  This section 
     of the Act adds a new chapter 122, entitled "Encrypted Wire and 
     Electronic Communications," to title 18 of the United States Code to 
     establish privacy standards for key holders and to set forth 
     procedures that law enforcement officers must follow to obtain 
     decryption assistance from key holders.
     
        (a)     In General.  New chapter 122 has five sections. 
     
        &#167; 2801. Definitions. Generally, the terms used in the new chapter 
     have the same meanings as in the federal wiretap statute in 18 U.S.C. 
     &#167; 2510. Definitions are provided for "encryption", "key holder", 
     "decryption key", and "decryption assistance". A "key holder" may, but 
     is not required to be, a Federal agency.
     
        This chapter applies only to wire or electronic communications and 
     communications in electronic storage, as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510, 
     and not to stored electronic data. For example, encrypted electronic 
     mail messages, encrypted telephone conversations, encrypted facsimile 
     transmissions, encrypted computer transmissions and encrypted file 
     transfers over the Internet would be covered, but not encrypted data 
     merely stored on computers. 
      
        &#167; 2802. Prohibited acts by key holders.  
     
        (a)     UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE OF KEY.-  Key holders will be subject 
     to both criminal and civil liability for the unauthorized release of 
     decryption keys or providing unauthorized decryption assistance. 
     
        (b)     AUTHORIZED RELEASE OF KEY.-  Key holders are authorized to 
     release decryption keys or provide decryption assistance with the 
     consent of the key owner, as may be necessary for the holding or 
     management of the key, or to investigative or law enforcement officers 
     upon compliance with the procedures set forth in subsection (c).
     
        (c)     REQUIREMENTS FOR RELEASE OF DECRYPTION KEY TO INVESTIGATIVE 
     OR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.- To obtain access to a decryption key or 
     decryption assistance from a key holder, an investigative or law 
     enforcement officer must present to the key holder the same form of 
     lawful process used to obtain access to the encrypted content. For 
     example, to obtain the decryption key to, or decryption assistance 
     for, an encrypted telephone conversation that is the subject of a 
     court-ordered wiretap under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518, a law enforcement agent 
     must present a court order to the key holder to obtain the decoding 
     key. Likewise, to obtain the decryption key to, or decryption 
     assistance for, an encrypted stored wire or electronic communication, 
     a law enforcement officer must present a court warrant, order, 
     subpoena or certification, depending upon what process was used to 
     obtain access to the stored communication. 
     
        Key holders may only provide the minimal key release or decryption 
     assistance needed to access the particular communications specified by 
     court order or other legal process.  Released keys or other decryption 
     assistance may only be used in the manner and for the purpose and 
     duration expressly provided by court order or other legal process. 
     
        A key holder who fails to provide the decryption key or decryption 
     assistance called for in the court order, subpoena or other lawful 
     process may be penalized under current contempt or obstruction laws.
     
        (d)     RECORDS OR OTHER INFORMATION HELD BY KEY HOLDERS.-  Key 
     holders are prohibited from disclosing records or other information 
     (not including decryption keys) pertaining to key owners, except with 
     the owner's consent or to an investigative or law enforcement officer, 
     pursuant to a subpoena, court order or other lawful process. 
     
        (e)     CRIMINAL PENALTIES.-  Key holders who violate this section 
     for a tortious, malicious or an illegal purpose, or for direct or 
     indirect commercial advantage or private commercial gain, will be 
     subject to a fine and up to 1 year imprisonment for a first offense, 
     and fine and up to 2 years' imprisonment for a second offense. Other 
     reckless and intentional violations would subject the key holder to a 
     fine of up to $5000 and up to 6 months' imprisonment.
     
        (f)     CIVIL DAMAGES.-  Persons aggrieved by key holder violations 
     may sue for injunctive relief, and actual damages or statutory damages 
     of $5,000, whichever is greater.   
     
        (g)     DEFENSE.-       A complete defense is provided if the 
     defendant acted in good faith reliance upon a court order, warrant, 
     grand jury or trial subpoena or statutory authorization.
      
        &#167; 2803. Reporting requirements. The Attorney General is required to 
     include in her report to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts 
     under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2519(2), the number of orders and extensions served 
     on key holders to obtain access to decryption keys or decryption 
     assistance.  The Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. 
     Courts is required to include this information, and the offenses for 
     which the orders were obtained, in the report to Congress under 18 
     U.S.C. &#167; 2519(3).
     
        &#167; 2804. Unlawful use of encryption to obstruct justice.
     Persons who willfully use encryption in an effort and for the purpose 
     of obstructing, impeding, or prevent the communication of information 
     in furtherance of a federal felony crime to a law enforcement officer, 
     would be subject to a fine and up to 5 years' imprisonment for a first 
     offense, and up to 10 years' imprisonment for a second or subsequent 
     offense.
     
        &#167; 2805. Freedom to sell encryption products.  
     
        (a)     IN GENERAL.- The Act legislatively confirms that it is 
     lawful to sell any encryption, regardless of encryption algorithm, key 
     length or implementation used, domestically in the United States or 
     its territories. 
     
        (b)     CONTROL OF EXPORTS BY SECRETARY OF COMMERCE.- 
     Notwithstanding any other law, the Act vests the Secretary of Commerce 
     with control of exports of hardware, software and technology for 
     information security, including encryption for both communications and 
     other stored data, except when the hardware, software or technology is 
     specifically designed or modified for military use. 
     
        No export license may be required for encryption software and 
     hardware with encryption capabilities that is generally available, 
     including mass market products (i.e., those generally available, sold 
     "as is", and designed for installation by the purchaser) or encryption 
     in the public domain and generally accessible. For example, no 
     licenses would be required for encryption products commercially 
     available without restriction and sold "as is", such as Netscape's 
     commercially available World Wide Web Browser, which can not be 
     exported.  Similarly, no license would be required to export software 
     and corresponding hardware placed in the public domain and generally 
     accessible, such as Phil Zimmermann's Pretty Good Privacy program, 
     which has been distributed to the public free of charge via the 
     Internet.
     
        In addition, the Secretary of Commerce must authorize the export of 
     encryption software to commercial users in any country to which 
     exports of such software has been approved for use by foreign 
     financial institutions, except when there is substantial evidence that 
     the software will be diverted or modified for military or terrorists' 
     end-use or re-exported without requisite U.S. authorization. Finally, 
     the Secretary of Commerce must authorize the export of computer 
     hardware with encryption capabilities if the Secretary determines that 
     a product with comparable security is commercially available from 
     foreign suppliers without effective restrictions outside the United 
     States.
     
        Significantly, the government is authorized to continue controls on 
     countries that pose terrorism concerns, such as Libya, Syria and Iran, 
     or other embargoed countries, such as Cuba and North Korea, pursuant 
     to the Trading With the Enemy Act or the International Emergency 
     Economic Powers Act.
     
        (b)     Technical Amendment.  The Act adds new chapter 122 and the 
     new title in the table of chapters in title 18 of the United States 
     Code.
    
     SEC. 6.  INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES.  The Act does not authorize the 
     conduct of intelligence activities, nor affect the conduct by Federal 
     government officers or employees in intercepting (1) encrypted or 
     other official communications of Federal executive branch or Federal 
     contractors for communications security purposes; (2) radio 
     communications between or among foreign powers or agents, as defined 
     by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA); or (3) electronic 
     communication systems used exclusively by foreign powers or agents, as 
     defined by FISA.

Summary of Testimony Barry F. Crimmins

There is a major crime wave taking place on America's computers. The 
proliferation of child pornography trafficking has created an anonymous 
"Pedophile Superstore." As a result, the de facto decriminalization of 
child pornography is taking place. The demand for child pornography is 
also a demand for innocent children to be abused. Child pornography is 
not protected speech. It is crime evidence. The on-line service "America 
OnLine" (AOL) has become an integral link in a network of child 
pornography traffickers. It cannot claim that it is not aware of this. 
If AOL just put a percentage of the effort it makes to spin-doctor away 
its culpability for these problems into solving them, inexpensive and 
effective solutions could be found. AOL has been unresponsive and 
arrogant when approached in a good-faith effort to solve these problems. 
This testimony is the result of over six months of research. It 
documents something the American people need to know: not only are their 
children unsafe on America Online, their children are unsafe because of 
it. 

Testimony Before the Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing on Child 
Pornography on the Internet

24 July, 1995

Barry F. Crimmins

Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee: Thank you for this opportunity 
to use my first amendment right to speak out today about some very 
dangerous criminal activity that is proliferating unabated via computer 
throughout our nation. My name is Barry Crimmins. I am a writer and a 
children's rights and safety activist residing in Ohio. I am also an 
adult survivor of childhood sexual abuse. Since this is a public 
hearing, I hasten to add that my abuse was not perpetrated by a member 
of my family. 

Last September, I purchased a new computer with a modem in order to 
communicate "on-line." I joined the service America OnLine (AOL) because 
I wanted to be able to quickly access and computerize information that 
was of interest to me.

Among the services available on AOL is something called the "People 
Connection." People Connection is a three-tiered structure. The first 
two tiers or areas are accessible to anyone using the service unless the 
parental control software is utilized to limit a child's access. These 
tiers are the "public" or AOL-sponsored rooms and the "member" rooms 
created by the users of the service. A room is a place where someone who 
has signed-on can meet and interact live with others by exchanging typed 
messages that appear in a large window or screen that everyone else in 
the room can read and respond to. These rooms are listed on a scroll and 
a user may browse the list, select a room to enter, and join a 
discussion or debate with other members. The third tier consists of 
private rooms. These are not publicly listed and are often used to 
rendezvous with other members without providing the rest of AOL's 
members access to the private electronic gathering. For several months, 
I did not discover the member rooms until I was informed that there was 
a regular meeting of Abuse Survivors in this area.

Before I could find the Abuse Survivors' room on the member scroll, I 
came upon numerous atrocious rooms. Many were obviously created by, and 
for, pedophiles. There were rooms promoting rape, incest, the exchange 
of child pornography, hate crimes, and every possible, and in some cases 
impossible, sexual activity. If one could imagine it, it was there. The 
first time I found the Abuse Survivors' room, it was located between a 
room called "DadsNDaughtrs" and another entitled "lilboypix." 

I discovered that people enter these rooms and mainly communicate by 
"Instant (or private) Message" with other people who are in the room 
(there is a constantly updated roster of who is in the room available at 
the push of a button). It is in these private messages that most of the 
trading of graphic image files or "GIFs" (Computerized transmittable 
photographs) is negotiated. It is, however, not unusual for people to 
just send unsolicited GIFs to everyone in the room on the "good faith" 
that they will have similar files returned to them. The rooms that I 
have investigated have been almost exclusively child pornography 
exchanges, but I have followed some of the traders of such material into 
adult porn rooms where they continued to solicit and exchange child 
pornography. When AOL closes one of the particularly egregious rooms, 
they often suggest that the participants re-create the room as a 
"private room." This, for all intents and purposes, says "you may 
continue to conduct your illegal activity on our service, just do it in 
private." 

My first response was to turn to the "service" and demand that they take 
immediate action to prohibit such activities. After several weeks of 
communicating my outrage to them, it became clear that for whatever 
reason, AOL was not going to do anything to remedy the situation. Since 
then, I have sought the assistance of various local, state, and federal 
authorities. As I write this, much of the investigative work I have done 
is in the hands of said authorities. I hope this will result in the 
arrests of numerous traffickers in child pornography. I also hope that 
it establishes that AOL has had a great deal of prior knowledge as to 
how its service is being misused, and therefore, AOL facilitates and 
profiteers on these dastardly crimes. It is not hyperbolic to state that 
AOL is the key link in a network of child pornography traffickers that 
has grown exponentially over the last several months.

Child pornography is easily accessed on AOL. Working both under my own 
name and undercover (often with a profile that clearly stated I was 12 
years old), I have been sent over a thousand pornographic photographs of 
children via AOL. I have seen every possible type of sexual degradation 
of children, from toddlers to teens. I have forwarded all of this 
material to both AOL and the proper authorities. AOL does not suggest 
that such files be forwarded to anyone but its Terms of Service 
department (which may, in and of itself, be a crime). If AOL has not 
sent every single file of child pornography it has received to the 
authorities, then AOL has committed felonies. Because if this is the 
case, AOL is a receiver of child pornography. At one point a 
particularly sick individual sent me (in my guise as a 12-year-old) so 
much child pornography that it took eight and a half hours to download 
it. AOL did not even e-mail me back to acknowledge receipt of it. I 
wrote and asked for a credit to my account for the time it took me to 
gather this astonishing amount of crime evidence. AOL did not respond to 
this either. Ten weeks later this criminal was still on-line and 
actively exchanging child pornography in AOL's member rooms. 

Much of the controversy surrounding the problems of online pedophiles 
centers on "parental controls." This issue completely disregards a 
serious reality: in many cases the parents themselves are the 
perpetrators of these crimes. AOL constantly has rooms entitled "family 
fun," "Nudist families," "Incest is best," "Have hot stepdaughter," and 
so on. In these rooms, child pornography is exchanged, and incest is 
discussed and celebrated. Many of the photos that are exchanged are 
purportedly of people's own children. So, the myth that parents should 
be the sole entity that should protect children on-line, or anywhere 
else, is once again exploded.

This committee also is concerned with children being enabled to access 
pornography on-line. Children accessing pornography is most serious when 
it is used by pedophiles to arouse their curiosity. Once they gain the 
child's attention, he or she is much more vulnerable to exploitation by 
a pedophile. The worst possibility is that pedophiles will use the 
childrens' curiosity and vulnerability to gain physical access to them 
so that they might sexually and/or physically abuse these children. It 
is extremely probable that a number of missing children have disappeared 
because of such contacts. In my investigation, many pedophiles, 
believing that I was a 12-year-old, attempted to woo me in this fashion. 

But, of even more dire (quantitative) consequence is the easy access 
adults now have to child pornography. The development and growth of the 
Internet and on-line service providers has enabled exploiters of 
children to distribute child pornography to the masses. Computers and 
modems have created an anonymous "Pedophile Superstore." The law of 
supply and demand is kicking in. The increased demand for child 
pornography directly translates into an increased number of sexually 
abused children. You cannot have child pornography without abused 
children. People, who may have never acted on such impulses before, are 
emboldened when they see that there are so many other individuals who 
have similar interests. What has recently taken place is nothing short 
of the de facto decriminalization of child pornography. As a result, 
countless innocents are being abused and having their lives destroyed. 
This is a full-scale emergency and if the well-being and safety of any 
group other than children were threatened, we would never hear the end 
of it. Nor, should we. Unfortunately, for the exact same reason that 
children are the victims of these crimes, children are not being heard. 
They are weak, economically powerless, and generally not taken 
seriously.

What is needed right now is funding to create a task force of computer 
and legal experts to enforce Zero Tolerance for Child Pornography. As 
early as 1983, use of computer networking for pedophiles was being 
advocated in the North American Man Boy Love Association Journal. The 
pedophiles have a huge head start. People need to see their neighbors 
(who have participated in these criminal acts) taken away, jailed, and 
stigmatized as "perverts." If this is done in a public, no-nonsense 
manner, it should seriously reverse the crisis that is destroying 
countless innocent children.

This crackdown must also include serious punitive measures against 
companies like AOL. The profit must be removed from "looking the other 
way." If AOL put a fraction of the effort into dealing with this problem 
that they put into spin doctoring their culpability, things would 
improve rapidly. Kids cannot hire lobbyists and publicists with the 
profits derived from their exploitation to influence you. It galls me to 
think that I have paid AOL more than enough money to pay for the 
appearance of their attorney here today.

In the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's excellent 
report: "Child Molesters: A Behavioral Analysis," the gravity of 
trafficking child pornography is addressed when the author aptly 
summates, "Any individual, however, who collects or distributes child 
pornography actually perpetuates the sexual abuse or exploitation of the 
child portrayed. It is no different than the circulation of sexually 
explicit pictures taken by a rapist of his victim during the rape. Such 
collectors of child pornography are, in essence, child molesters." This 
report is a must- read for all interested in this problem and is an 
accurate checklist of the types of perpetrators I have encountered on 
AOL. 

I have met encounter many child pornography traffickers on AOL who were 
touting their first amendment right to possess and exchange whatever 
material they care to. These people are deluding themselves if they 
think child pornography is protected speech. It is not. It is crime 
evidence. 

Response to AOL's Corporate Alibis

AOL has consistently claimed that most of th ese problems are occurring 
in private e-mails. And therefore they are helpless to do anything about 
it, without violating the rights of all members. The actual transfer of 
illegal materials takes place via e-mail, but the genesis of these 
transactions is easily traced to publicly accessible member rooms. 
Without these rooms, the perpetrators of these crimes would be unable to 
network with other faceless criminals. AOL maintains that it could never 
police the problem, but it would be simple and relatively inexpensive to 
have all member- created rooms cleared by properly trained staffers. 
Under AOL's present system, only easily fooled software stands between a 
pedophile and the creation of an egregious room. A slight misspelling 
and the most brazen of rooms is on-line and in business.

AOL frequently claims that there are minimal problems on its service 
because all members are required to understand and conform to its Terms 
of Service (TOS). I doubt that these compli-cated rules are read or 
understood by members. Terms of Service contains strict guidelines for 
on- line conduct. For example, profanity, harassment, and the exchange 
of illegal files are all TOS violations. If AOL enforced these rules, 
their service would be a much safer and genuinely "family friendly" 
place. But since these rules are not enforced, AOL is an unsafe place 
for many people.

AOL maintains that only a small percentage of its members are involved 
in illegal activities. This is probably true. However, it would be 
interesting to determine what percentage of its income is derived from 
such persons. It takes a lot of time to up and download Graphic Image 
Files (GIFs). This results in very high AOL bills for the traders of 
such files. Time and again, AOL has told me that as soon as they close 
one room, another opens. Exactly. Under the current system there is 
always somewhere for child pornography traffickers and pedophiles to go. 
This problem would be easily solved with the use of live staff members 
to approve or disap-prove of rooms. But this, of course, would mean 
there would no longer always be another egregious room opening. The 
expense of hiring a few more staffers would be a pittance to such a 
going concern (AOL added 500,000 customers between Christmas 1994 and 
early March of 1995). Additional staffing would be a minimal expense, 
unless AOL is including in its cost the loss of a "small percentage of 
customers" who just happen to have inordinately high monthly bills. 

America Online is a publicly owned business. There are stockholders to 
whom the management is accountable. If I were one of those stockholders, 
I would seriously question the vision and judgment of those currently in 
power. They are conducting business in a very questionable fashion. They 
have a thriving and dynamic company with unlimited potential to be a 
valuable asset to the American people. Unfortunately, their current 
business practices do not indicate that the company's future is 
necessarily rosy. The customer is not always right at AOL, as a matter 
of fact, the customer is generally ignored or dismissed with an 
impenetrable bureaucracy and treated as if they are impertinent and a 
petty bother in the process. Time constraints preclude me from including 
much of the printed documentation of my correspondence with AOL in this 
oral testimony. But I have made copies of some of the more telling 
exchanges for distribution to the committee and the press. In particular 
I ask that you review the 17 questions in Attachment C. that I sent to 
AOL's media relations director Pam McGraw and the woefully inadequate 
response I received from her (Attachment D.). Also, I have included a 
list of several dozen of the rooms about which I have complained to AOL. 
Their very titles provide a brief, yet shocking, illumination of the 
depravity that is publicly exhibited on a daily basis on AOL's member 
room scroll. I would also be happy to make this material available to 
other on-line services, including the new Microsoft Net, as a template 
of what not to do. 

In closing, I am here to tell the American people that not only are 
their children unsafe on AOL, their children are unsafe because of it.

Correspondence Between Barry Crimmins and America Online 

2-2-95 To: the Tosadvisor,

Last week I forwarded child pornography to aol that was sent, 
unsolicited, to me through your service. After 7 days I received a 
response that told me that even though I was an offended party I had no 
right to be informed of the actions (if any) that were taken against the 
criminal who offended me. This is a completely unsatisfactory response. 

That aside, the problem I have with private rooms is not that I'm 
harassed in them. I never frequent these rooms except to follow obvious 
pedophiles into them. My problem is that aol has a policy of suggesting 
that offensive member rooms become private rooms when the tos advisor 
shuts them down. I have seen this happen (and have a record of this) 
when the suggestion was made in a room full of people exchanging child 
pornography. As far as I'm concerned, this announcement was a formal 
facilitation of child pornographers by aol. I have written and asked for 
a clarification and all you suggest is I hit the ignore button. Well 
ignoring child pornography does not stop its spread, nor does it relieve 
aol of its responsibilities when its service is being used as a "safe 
harbor" for such criminals.

It took one week to receive a completely unsatisfactory response from 
aol about these matters. I have tried to give aol a fair chance to take 
appropriate action or to even say, "Now that you bring that up, perhaps 
we need a more specific policy about ....", Instead all I received was a 
corporate suggestion to "ignore" pedophiles. Well I will not bury my 
head in the sand about this, nor will I be silent about my 
dissatisfaction with your service. Please let me know who I should 
address formal journalistic inquiries to at aol and kindly include a 
telephone number. Thank you. 

Very truly yours,
Barry F. Crimmins

1-29-95 To TOS Staff, I am a journalist as well as a children's rights 
and safety advocate. I have filed dozens of complaints w/aol about 
pedophile chat rooms. Lately, to your credit, there has been an improved 
vigilance by tos staff on these matters. However, I have been sent child 
pornography without solicitation (when I was just checking out child pic 
exchange), I forwarded it to aol and never had it acknowledged. 

Also I cannot complain severely enough about aol's practice of 
suggesting (when they shut down obvious pedophile rooms) that the 
occupants continue their endeavor in a private room. This results in the 
formal sanctioning by aol of "safe harbors" for pedophiles, child 
pornographers etc.

I hope that the piece I'm writing has a happy ending. I hope it is the 
story of how aol used some of its massive profits to assure itself and 
the world that the safety and innocence of children are your service's 
utmost priority. If this is the case please contact me as I think I can 
be of assistance.	Very truly yours,
Barry Crimmins

To: [Barry Crimmins]

Dear Member:

Thanks for reporting the adult graphics file you received. We'll look 
into it and take the appropriate action.

America Online takes the transfer of this material very seriously, and 
will cooperate with investigations by local, state or federal law 
enforcement agencies in order to curb this activity. 

For confidentiality reasons, we cannot disclose information on actions 
we've taken against other members, however, the resources available to 
us include written warnings and account termination. 

If the situation merits, we may bring charges against the senders. 

Actions within a private room do not fall under the jurisdiction of the 
Terms of Service. We strongly suggest that if you are being harassed by 
someone in a private room, you use the "ignore" button to block their 
dialogue from your screen.

Dear Mr. Crimmons:

Thanks very much for forwarding this information to me. While policy 
does not allow me to relay the exact status of another member's account 
to you, please know that I have taken appropriate action against the 
sender. 

AOL has zero tolerance for any exploitation of children on our service, 
and I'm sure you are aware that we take very strong steps to respond to 
these activities, once they are brought to our attention. 

I have also taken the liberty of forwarding your email to our Corporate 
Communications Department, so that they are allowed the opportunity to 
address your concerns as they relate to media. 

Again, thank you for your interest in upholding AOL's community 
standards, and if you have any further questions or comments, please be 
sure to write again.

Dear AOL Officials, There seems to be no improvement with these type of

are not getting the job done. I in no way am questioning AOL's

Subj: Aol pedophile policy
To: PamMcGraw

Dear Pam, Thank you for your letter. I have been on-line for dozens and 
dozens of hours researching on-line pedophiles. It is rare for there to 
be less than ten rooms that are serious problems. If I had to put a 
figure on it I would say the average number of offending chat rooms per 
scroll is at least 15. There have been times lately when there are only 
three or four of these rooms but there has never been 24 straight hours 
when the problem hasn't risen to previous levels.

Although it seems to me that some sincere efforts are being made by AOL, 
much more needs to be done. I am going to be writing and/or producing a 
story about this situation. I would prefer that it be the story of how 
AOL is truly setting standards not only as the best on-line service but 
the most conscientious. From the thoughtful notes I received from both 
you and Mr. Hypolite, I know that there are people in authority at AOL 
who are willing to make that happen.

I have many, many documents that verify what is going on in the chat 
rooms. I have been sent child pornography on six occasions. I also have 
a considerable amount of correspondence with AOL guides, advisors etc. 
that illustrate a rather naive approach to dealing with this problem. I 
would be glad to make portions of this material available to AOL in 
hopes that it would increase awareness about the problem of pedophiles 
on-line. I also have a number of suggestions that may be helpful as AOL 
revamps the procedure for closing these offensive rooms. 

I would like to speak to you about these matters as soon as possible. I 
can be reached at**********. I will also try to call you at AOL. Thank 
you for your time.

Very truly yours,
Barry F. Crimmins

Thank you for the Guide Pager notice! Room names such as the one you are 
referring to are created by members. Room names are scanned on a regular 
basis, but rooms at one end of the list are frequently recreated by the 
time the other end of the Rooms list is reached. The TOS staff is 
currently in the process of revamping the procedure for closing such 
rooms so that this problem can be better handled. If you have any 
questions or comments regarding a specific room name, you can contact 
the Terms of Service staff via Keyword: TOS, or by selecting the Terms 
of Service option from PC Studio (either the PC Studio icon on chat 
screens, or Keyword: PC Studio).

Thank you for your understanding. :)

Questions from Barry Crimmins to America Online 

Sent: 95-02-14

Dear Pam,

I in no way want to ambush anyone I speak to about this story (except of 
course pedophiles). So here are some of the questions I will be looking 
to have answered:

1- What is AOL's assessment of the problem of on-line pedophiles? 

2- In a letter from a Tos guide, I was informed that AOL is "revamping 
its procedure" for closing offensive rooms. If true, what does this 
procedure entail?

3- Has AOL brought in any consultants who are experts on pedophiles? If 
so, who?

4- Has AOL ever considered segregating "adult chat rooms"? (For example 
nobody with a profile that says they are a minor is permitted) 

5- Would AOL consider creating a different chat area for teens? 

6- Does AOL realize that if abuse survivors want to search for a chat 
room to discuss their lives with other survivors, they are often 
subjected to scrolling through any number of rooms that celebrate sexual 
abuse? 

7- Just recently AOL stopped suggesting that participants in offensive 
rooms, closed for TOS violations, consider just moving their gathering 
in a private room. Why and when was this policy changed? Why was it ever 
in place?

8- Is it possible for AOL to restrict access to certain areas to any 
account (not screen name but entire accounts) that has been used 
repeatedly to participate in obvious pedophile chat rooms? 

9- Would AOL consider giving a cyber-hub (if that's what you call it) to 
a consortium of pro-child non-profit organizations? 

10- Would AOL consider placing an Email address for the FBI on its 
service so that people, sent illegal files (child pornography in 
particular), could instantly transfer them to the federal authorities? 

11-How is the AOL on-line staff selected and trained? Are these people 
all paid employees?

12-Why doesn't AOL have the equivalent of broadcasting's "kill switch"? 
In other words as soon as someone creates a room it would have to get 
through AOL's "goalie". If it is in obvious violation of TOS it is 
closed before it opens.

13- How does AOL feel about its service being misused to the point where 
it has become an integral part in a network of child pornographers? 

14- In the past AOL has assured users that it could handle the 
burgeoning problem of on-line pedophiles "in-house". However the 
incidence of such criminal activity has grown dramatically in the past 
year. What changes in policy, implementation etc., has AOL adopted to 
transform current assurances into a workable and consistent program of 
enforcement of your services own TOS policies? 15- How many AOL staffers 
are currently assigned to policing member created rooms? How many worker 
hours per week does this entail? 

16- What is AOL's take on the Baker BBS Rape fantasy case in Michigan? 

17-Some legislators are already looking into on-line abuses. Does AOL 
expect the government to get involved in the regulation of on-line 
services?

I am certain that in the course of any interviews I conduct, several 
extemporaneous questions will also occur. I hope that this advance list 
will be considered as a show of good-faith on my part. I am also sending 
Mr. Hypolite a copy of this letter because I feel many of the questions 
are about matters that are under his jurisdiction. Thank you for your 
time. Very truly yours,

America Online's Response to Questions Posed by Barry F. Crimmins 

Sent: 95-02-21 09:46:20 EST

Dear Barry,

Thanks for your letter pertaining to the problem of pedophiles online. I 
hope the following answers clearly indicate where America Online stands 
on this issue and what is being done to combat the trafficking of child 
pornography on the service. Throughout these answers we refer to TOS -- 
Terms of Service -- which are guidelines for using the AOL service. I 
trust you are aware of these and you can access TOS by using keyword: 
TOS.

1. AOL has been forthright about the issue both with its members and 
with law enforcement agencies (see Steve Case letter dated 1/695). 
Unfortunately, the gravity of such offenses can sometimes leave the 
mistaken impression that they are much more commonplace than is true. 
With more than 2 million subscribers - the largest online service in the 
U.S. - the number of pedophiles using America Online represents a tiny 
fraction of our member community. |

2. America Online is considering a number of tools to make the jobs of 
TOS and AOL Guides easier. However, at this point in time, it would be 
premature to discuss the details.

3. Child pornography is illegal. When the transmission of child 
pornography through private communications is brought to AOL's 
attention, once it is deemed illegal, the proper authorities are 
notified. 

4. America Online expects all members to follow its TOS guidelines. To 
segregate rooms based on behavior in those rooms would imply that AOL 
sanctions different rules and regulations for different rooms. AOL has 
one community and one set of rules for the members of that community. 

5. There is an area on AOL for teenagers called "Teen Chat" in the 
People Connection.

6. While we are aware that there are chat rooms that offend the 
sensibilities of some of our members, unless the rooms violate TOS we 
cannot remove them from the service. If the rooms, as you suggest, 
"celebrate sexual abuse," TOS should be notified and the offending rooms 
will be removed.

7. Rooms terminated for TOS violations are removed from the service. TOS 
may suggest members create private rooms in instances where participants 
are scrolling or otherwise creating a nuisance and disturbing other 
members.

8. If a member violates TOS, he or she may be warned or, depending on 
the severity of the infraction, be removed from the service. 

9. AOL has conducted a number of conversations with various non-profit 
organizations, some of them dealing with children's welfare. 

10. Members who receive illegal information through the service can 
forward that information to TOS and, if it is deemed illegal, the proper 
authorities are notified.

11. Members of the TOS staff are internal, paid employees who are 
trained in TOS rules and procedures. AOL Guides are remote volunteers 
who use overhead accounts. They are also trained by TOS staff and are 
screened before becoming Guides.

12. Online is a real-time, interactive service. America Online is 
considering a number of tools to make the jobs of TOS and AOL Guides 
easier.

13. While we acknowledge such activities do take place, with more than 2 
million members they are the exception rather than the rule. 

14. While the number of such incidents may be going up in your eyes, so 
is the number of AOL members. We have added more than 500,000 members 
since December alone.

Child pornography is illegal. When the transmission of child pornography 
through private communications is brought to AOL's attention, once it is 
deemed illegal, the proper authorities are notified. 

We've had a growing problem with member-created rooms whose title and 
discussion violate our Terms of Service. As more and more members abuse 
the privilege and establish rooms that suggest illegal activity, or 
detract from the enjoyment of others with offensive titles, we are faced 
with looking at a higher level of safeguards as it relates to member-
created rooms. America Online is considering a number of tools to make 
the jobs of TOS and AOL Guides easier.

15. AOL staffs its service 24 hours a day and staffs according to 
growth. 

16. AOL does not comment on specific cases. 

17. Overall, the online services industry is a making concerted effort 
to police their own services.

I hope these answers have been of assistance. 

Regards, Pam McGraw	Attachment

There are dozens room names more that I will make available upon 
request. In the last few months AOL's software must be catching some 
more stuff because most of the rooms are now spelled incorrectly or 
employ the x-device.

1 note: this is the new device -- putting an x between every letter of 
the room title, this one says "yng pic trade."

<h3><center>Interview With David Frost, PBS 5/31/95</h3></center>
<p>
<p>
<b>Frost:</b>  Right. What do you think about Senator Exon's ideas for federal 
law to ban obscene material from the Internet? Is that practical?
<p>
<b>Gingrich:</b> It's probably illegal under our Constitution is my guess. We 
have a very strong freedom of speech provision. On the other hand, I've been
advocating quite openly that major advertisers ought to announce that they
will not advertise on radio stations that broadcast songs encouraging the
raping and the torture and the physical violence against women.  I mean,
freedom of speech doesn't mean subsidized speech.  And we have every right as
a culture, not as a government but as a culture; we have every right for wise 
leadership to say we won't support that. We won't tolerate that. 
<p>
<b>Gingrich:</b> Now, first of all ... computers. There is a problem, nowadays 
.. I was quite surprised when I was told this by an expert. There is a problem
nowadays, pedophiles - using computer networking to try to pursue children.
It's truly amazing. I think there you have a perfect right on a non-censorship 
basis to intervene decisively against somebody who would prey upon children. 
And that I would support very intensely. It's very different than trying to censor 
willing adults.

Memorandum

DATE:   June 7, 1995
TO:     Interested Senators and Telecommunications Staff
FROM:   Jill Lesser, People For the American Way Action
Fund    Danny Weitzner, Center for Democracy & Technology
RE:     The Communications Decency Act is clearly unconstitutional
        under Alliance for Community Media v. FCC.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

        Yesterday, the United States Court of Appeals for the District 
of Columbia issued an en banc decision in the case of  Alliance for
Community Media v. FCC, (Docket #93-1169).  That decision clearly
established that, if enacted, the Communications Decency Act would
be held unconstitutional.  The court stated that a ban on
indecency would be unconstitutional and that any regulation of
indecent speech must be accomplished in the least restrictive
manner possible, as established by a legislative record.  While
the court upheld the FCC's regulations, the decision was narrowly
based on the fact that there was no state action in the statute. 
However, it is indisputable that the proposed ban in the
Communications Decency Act constitutes state action. We believe
that members of  the Senate should reject the Communications
Decency Act and refuse to engage in the futile charade of enacting
legislation that would undoubtedly be held unconstitutional. 

The Facts of the Alliance Case
==============================

        The Alliance case concerns a challenge to the FCC's 
implementing regulations of  Section 10 of the Cable Television 
Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. That section 
permitted cable operators to refuse to carry PEG and leased access
programming that the operator "reasonably believes describes or
depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently
offensive manner as measured by contemporary community standards
for the cable medium." (sections 10(a) and 10(c)).  The
regulations authorized cable operators to refuse to carry
"indecent programming on leased access.  Section 10(b) and the
implementing regulations then required a cable operator that
determined to carry indecent programming, to segregate on a single
channel and block the programming and satisfy a subscriber's
request to received such a blocked channel within thirty days of a
written request.

Unlike the Communications Decency Act Sections 10(a) and (c) do
Not Constitute State Action
===========================

         Judge Randolph, writing for the majority, upheld the
constitutionality of Sections 10(a) and 10(c) and their
implementing regulations based upon the determination that the
permissive language in the statute did not constitute state
action, and therefore was not subject to any First Amendment
scrutiny.  The Court found that Congress, in giving cable
operators editorial discretion, was merely shifting the editorial
control over leased and PEG access programming to cable operators
from cable programmers.  While the Court therefore did not have to
pass on the constitutionality of an indecency ban, it nonetheless
took the opportunity to state the following quite specifically:
While the government may [ ] restrict the showing of indecent
programs, it may do so only in a manner consistent with the First
Amendment.  See Sable Communications of California, Inc. v. FCC,
492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989)[setting forth the least restrictive means
test and striking down legislation totally banning indecent
interstate commercial telephone messages].  If decisions of cable
operators not to carry indecent programs on leased or PEG access
channels, decisions section 10(a) and 10 (c) permit, were treated
as decisions of the government, the Commission and the United
States would be hard put to defend the constitutionality of these
provisions (emphasis added).

        This language confirms the long-standing constitutional 
principle
that a wholesale ban on indecency is unconstitutional.  As this
court emphasized, "[o]bscenity has no constitutional protection,"
but indecency is constitutionally protected.  Thus the
Communications Decency Act, which seeks to establish a government
mandated prohibition on indecent communications, would clearly be
held unconstitutional. 

The Constitutionality of Section 10(b) Upheld Based on Nature of
the Technology and Least Restrictive Means
==========================================

        The D.C. Circuit then went on to consider the constitutionality
of the requirements established in subsection 10(b) and its
implementing regulations.  The question here was not whether this
was considered government regulation of speech, but whether in
regulating non-obscene speech, the FCC's regulations withstood the
exacting level of scrutiny required.  The court first compared the
decision in Pacifica Foundation v. FCC, 438 U.S. 726 (1978) with
the Sable decision and made two important observations: 
"First, the constitutionality of indecency regulation in a given
medium turns, in part, on the medium's characteristics.  Second,
in fashioning such regulation, the government must strive to
accommodate at least two competing interests: the interest in
limiting children's exposure to indecency and the interest of
adults in having access to such material."

        While the court found that under the record established by
Congress and the FCC the cable medium had much more in common with
the broadcast medium than the telephone medium, it made no such
determination for other media.  In fact, in the context of the
on-line computer networks that the Communications Decency Act
seeks to reach, no such congressional finding has been made and
there has been no examination of the unique nature of  the medium
at all.  The lack of such a record would make it impossible for a
court to do anything but strike down any regulation on non-obscene
computer based communications.  

        In the second observation above, the court emphasized the
importance of the rights of adults to have access to indecent
material, and it therefore applied the least restrictive means
test to the FCC's regulations pursuant to subsection 10(b).  While
some might disagree with the court's determination that the
segregation, blocking and waiting period established by the FCC
was the most effective and therefore "least restrictive means" for
protecting children from access to indecency on cable television,
it is indisputable that the Communications Decency Act indicates
no attempt to establish a least restrictive system that would
preserve the rights of adults to have access to certain material.

Exon Bill Fails Least Restrictive Means Test Because Congress has
not Explored Alternatives
=========================

        The Communications Decency Act attempts to amend existing rules
relating only to telephone and audiotext services, while adopting
the same goal of protecting minors.  However, interactive media is
materially different than analog telephone and audiotext
technology in that is offers users the ability to exercise control
over precisely what information one accesses.  Given the dramatic
difference between telephone technology and interactive services
such as the Internet and other online services, blocking by the
carrier as demanded by  223 and the Communications Decency Act
would not meet the "least restrictive means" test.  Just as the
Sable court found broadcast indecency regulations inapplicable to
the telephone system because of differences in the medium,
regulations designed for audiotext services in the telephone
system are constitutionally inapplicable to new interactive media.

        Technologies already exist that enable users to access certain
information based on a variety of characteristics, or, to exclude
certain types of information from access.  With such filtering
technology, users, instead of the government or network operators,
can exercise control over the information content that they
receive in an interactive network environment.  User control could
be exercised in two ways.  First, one could screen out all
messages or programs based on information in the header.  If a
parent wanted to prevent a child from seeing a particular movie or
from participating in a particular online discussion group, then
the computer or other information appliance used by the child
could be set by the parent to screen out the objectionable
content.  Such features can often be protected with passwords
which would be assigned, for example, by the responsible adults in
the house.  Second, the same systems can be used to enable
blocking of content based on third-party rating systems.  For
example, those parents who accept TV Guide's judgment about the
presence of nudity and/or violence in particular programs, could
program their interactive TV sets to screen out all programs that
TV Guide has classified as violent.  The Senate has made no
attempt to review the existence or sufficiency of these technical
capabilities or their empowering characteristics for parents.
  
Conclusion 
==========

        The Alliance for Community Media decision has already been
reported widely in the press as a defeat for the civil liberties
community and a broadening of the government's ability to restrict
indecency in the media.  This, unfortunately, is true. However,
the decision also clearly establishes the unconstitutionality of
the Communications Decency Act and makes a good case for the study
proposed by Senator Patrick Leahy -- S. 714 The Child Protection,
User Empowerment, and Free Expression in Interactive Media Study
Bill.  That provision would permit a study of the means available
to protect children while maintaining a commitment to the First
Amendment rights of adults. 

        The two attached letters include lists of organizations that 
have
taken a position against the Communications Decency Act and in
support of the Leahy alternative.

====================================================================

                                        April 27, 1995

Dear Senator:

        We write on behalf of a diverse coalition of civil liberties,
education, library,  other civic organizations, as well as
commercial producers and distributors of entertainment, 
information and works of art and journalists to express our strong
belief that the Communications Decency Act of 1995 (the "Act")
(currently sections 401 through 408 of S. 652) violates the First
Amendment rights of all Americans.  In the name of protecting
children, the Act which was added as an amendment to
telecommunications reform legislation, criminalizes the exchange
of First Amendment-protected material between adults and restricts
the broad range of material available by computer to only that
which is deemed appropriate for children.

        We agree with the sponsors of  the legislation that there are
many  problems inherent in allowing access by our nation's
children to material that may be physiologically or emotionally
harmful.  And we recognize that the computer age has brought with
it many new questions about the ways in which parents can protect
their own children.  However, the Communications Decency Act will
not accomplish the goals of  protecting children, will stifle the
development of new technology empowering users, including parents
to define their limits in cyberspace and, instead, will virtually
destroy the exploding world of on line communications.  

        Grafted onto a twenty-five year old provision of the
Communications Act of 1934 which was designed for the specific
purpose of preventing children's access to dial-a-porn services
and protecting people from harassing phone calls, the
Communications Decency Act  fails to accomplish the goals being
advanced by its sponsors, and it is unconstitutional on its face. 
The Act makes it a crime to produce or distribute by
telecommunications device any "indecent" communications that may
be accessible by a minor.  It also bans the dissemination of  "any
comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image or other
communications which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or
indecent."  These crimes are punishable by up to two years in jail
and a fine of up to $100,000.

        Contrary to the implications of much of the media coverage, the
Act is not merely about sex and pornography.  It covers virtually
all areas of speech.  It is also not just about cyberspace -- it
covers every "telecommunications device" and every organization,
large or small, with e-mail.  It would affect much more than
children by restricting private e-mail communications between
consenting adults. The Communications Decency Act also violates
the First Amendment rights of adults to see, hear and read
material -- as they choose -- that is not legally obscene.  There
is a broad range of material with sexual content that is
inappropriate for minors but important for adults, including
novels, sex education material, movies, videos and recordings. 
Adults do not lose their First Amendment rights because these
works are being transmitted in a new medium. 
          
        We recognize that the rapid spread of computer technology has
made it more difficult for parents to stop their children from
gaining access to inappropriate material, but computer experts are
already developing tools to help them.  This technology will put
the power to censor in the only place that it belongs -- in the
hands of parents. In addition,  legislation already exists in all
50 states, as well as on the federal level, to ensure that
material that is harmful to minors does not get into the hands of
minors.  To the extent that any additional legislative tools are
needed to help enforce existing laws in the information age, they
must be the result of careful analysis and public debate.

        The fast-paced development of the Internet and the immense
opportunities it holds for economic development, education and
civic participation have captured the nation's imagination.  The
freedom with which ideas flow on the Internet is unprecedented in
human history.  The Communications Decency Act attacks this
freedom.  Like the United States, the Internet cannot survive
without free speech.

        We urge you to oppose the Communications Decency Act and to
demand careful  consideration of the important issues it tries to
address.

==================================================================

Delivered to the U.S. Senate:

                                                        May 22, 1995

Dear Senator______:

We write to urge you to support S. 714, the "Child Protection, 
User Empowerment, and Free Expression in Interactive Media Study 
Bill" (S. 714) introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT).  The 
legislation would require the Department of Justice and Commerce 
Departments to conduct a study of how to limit childrens' access 
to "violent, sexually-explicit, harassing, offensive, or 
otherwise unwanted material" consistent with the First Amendment 
and the free exchange of ideas.

As communications and computer firms, content providers, 
advertisers, trade associations and public interest organizations 
who have been working on various aspects of this issue, we 
believe that new interactive media raise many difficult, 
challenging issues regarding the protection of free speech, 
privacy, and access to controversial material.  Thus, we stand 
ready to work with the Administration and the Congress to explore 
all aspects of this issue as outlined in S. 714.

Legislation affecting the Internet and other new media is 
difficult to craft because of the need to reconcile a panoply of 
competing interests.  Among the interests that we believe must be 
satisfied are:

1.      Free speech and free press in interactive media  The 
First Amendment rights of both private individuals and commercial 
information providers must be fully protected;

2.      Child protection technology means should be available to 
enable parents to control children's access to material which 
parents find inappropriate;

3.      Service provider liability to assure the free flow of 
information and remove incentives to invade user's privacy, law 
must not force service providers into the position of being 
private censors.

4.      Privacy Individuals have both a free speech and privacy 
right to conduct private communications that may be considered 
offensive to others.

S. 714 identifies a number of critical questions that we believe 
deserve thorough study and  discussion.  First, is current law 
adequate to enable prosecution of child pornography and 
distribution of obscenity in online environments?  As has 
recently come to light, the Justice Department claims that it is 
vigorously prosecuting child pornographers and those who violate 
obscenity law.  Is more needed? Second, does law enforcement need 
more resources to investigate and prosecute under current law?

Finally, how can interactive technology itself help to resolve 
the issue.  As you may know,  there are technological means and 
user controls to enable parents to block access to objectionable 
materials, including material that is "violent, 
sexually-explicit, harassing, offensive, or otherwise unwanted."  
 Are such technologies and user controls available widely enough? 
 Are they easy enough for parents to use?  What steps can be taken
 to encourage the development of easy-to-use blocking technology. 
 We believe that interactive technology, in combination with 
voluntary industry standards, public education, and law, can 
resolve these access issues. 

For the above reasons, we urge you and others in the Senate to 
support S. 714. We believe the study will help both to develop 
broad understanding of the social, policy and technology 
challenges of new media as well as help policy makers formulate 
alternatives which best serve the public interest.  We are 
anxious to work with you to achieve these goals.

<title>CDT's Analysis of the 12/21/95 Conference Committee Draft</title>
</head>
<img src = "../../images/cdtlgo.gif">
<hr size = 2>
<P>
<h2>CDT's Analysis of the latest Communications Decency Act</h2>
<p>
<i>(From CDT Policy Post No. 33, January 4, 1996)</i>
<p>
The House/Senate telecommunications reform conference committee has 
released a preliminary draft of the final telecommunications reform 
bill, which includes provisions which would impose broad government 
regulations on constitutionally protected speech online. The text of 
these provisions is attached below.
<p>
The attached version of the CDA contains the changes approved at the 
December 6, 1995 conference committee meeting, where members voted to 
adopt Rep. Rick White's proposal but with significant changes, including 
a return to the unconstitutional "indecency" standard (See CDT Policy 
Post No. 32, 12/6/95). 
<p>
The conferees have made several important changes to the legislation, 
none of them are particularly favorable to cyberspace-rights advocates. 
Among other things, the latest draft:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Relies on the vague and blatantly unconstitutional "indecency" standard (Sec 502 (a) - (c))
<p>
<li>Prohibits sending "indecent" material directly to a minor or making indecent material available for display in a manner available to a minor (including world wide web pages, ftp sites, or usenet newsgroups) (Sec 502 (d)).
<p>
<li>No longer contains the provision of the Cox/Wyden/White bill prohibiting the FCC from imposing content or other regulations on the Internet or other interactive media.
<p>
<li>Contains weaker protections for content providers who label content and enable others to block it (e.g., PICS) have been weakened (Sec 502 (e)(5).
<p>
<li>Would allow states to impose additional restrictions on non-commercial activities such as freenets, BBS's, and non-profit content providers (Sec 502 (h)).
<p>
<li>Creates a new crime for the solicitation of minors using a computer, the US mail, or any other means of interstate or foreign commerce (Sec 508).
</ul>
<p>
CDT believes that this proposal threatens the very existence of the 
Internet as a means for free expression, education, and political 
discourse. The proposal is an unwarranted, unconstitutional intrusion by 
the Federal government into the private lives of all Americans.  
<p>
<b>NEXT STEPS: FINAL AGREEMENT NOT YET REACHED, VOTE COULD OCCUR SOON</b>
<p>
As you know, the CDA is part of the massive telecommunications reform 
legislation, which is currently being considered by a House/Senate 
conference committee. 
<p>
The conference committee has not reached agreement on several key  
issues, including whether the FCC should be permitted to regulate the 
Internet, broadcast ownership rules, and other issues. Reps. Rick White, 
Chris Cox, and others are currently fighting to retain the provisions 
baring the FCC from regulating online content. A final vote by the 
conferees to send the bill to the full congress will not occur until an 
agreement is reached on this and other outstanding issues.
<p>
As of Thursday January 4, 1996, the conferees have NOT yet voted to send 
a version of the legislation to the Full House and Senate for a final 
vote. No vote has been scheduled, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich has 
stated that no vote will occur until Congress finishes work on the 
Budget. 
<p>
CDT will continue to fight these provisions, and will work to remove 
them from the final telecommunications bill. We are also preparing to 
fight this issue in court, if necessary. 
<p>
<b>WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP</b>
<p>
The Voters Telecommunications Watch (VTW) has organized an online 
coalition (of which CDT is a member) against the net-censorship bill. To

<title>PRIVACY AND INDIVIDUAL EMPOWERMENT IN THE INTERACTIVE AGE</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
<p>
<center><h2> Privacy And Individual Empowerment<br> 
In The Interactive Age</h2></center>
<p>
<font size = +1>
<p>
<p>
<h3>I.  LANDSCAPE</h3>
<p>
The era we have come to characterize as the "Information Age" is 
evolving into the "Interactive Age." The communications technologies that 
made possible the collection, storage, transmission, and linkage of enormous 
amounts of information are now expanding to engage the individual consumer  in a variety of activities. More and more people are communicating by electronic mail; sites on the World Wide Web allow people to "browse,"  download information, and get linked to other sites; electronic malls invite people to window shop, inquire further about particular products and even  make purchases; people are subscribing to newsgroups and participating in chatrooms to gather and share information on topics of interest to them. 
<p>	
The potential benefits to society from these new digital media are 
undisputed and well-documented.  Freedom of speech and the right to receive information may enjoy a nearly limitless opportunity to flourish.  The commercial potential of the Internet is also vast.  What is troubling, however, is that this same technology makes it possible to generate, capture, store, and reuse a tremendous amount of personal transactional information and communications from diverse media, over the course of  a person's lifetime.  The "womb-to-tomb dossier" that Arthur Miller warned of 30 years ago may now be real -- not collected in a mainframe computer, but through a 
distributed and largely unregulated network. 
<p>
More focused attention is being paid to addressing the privacy issues 
that threaten to undermine substantially both the First Amendment and the 
commercial potential of the Interactive Age,  yet few concrete solutions have 
been proposed.  While there seems to be general agreement that individual 
privacy must be preserved, and even enhanced, in cyberspace, we are just 
beginning to explore the means to make privacy work in this new media. 1  
The recent deliberations, by both the government and the private sector, come at a time of increasing public concern with the loss of privacy.  A recent 
survey revealed that 83% of Americans are very concerned about their 
privacy.  This number has increased steadily over the years.  A finding of 
even greater importance in our "Interactive Age," is that the publics' concern 
with privacy reaches new heights when computerization is mentioned.   
<p>
Disquieting fear and confusion over the lack of privacy rules and 
standards act as a barrier to the public's willingness to use new media.   As 
information about the current practices of collecting and using personal 
information trickles out in news stories and in on-line discussion groups 
public concern will escalate.  The recent revelation that a marketer was 
gathering hundreds of thousands of individuals' email addresses culled from 
use of the World Wide Web and usenet discussion groups, created a furor over  the use of this transaction data.2
<p>	
A dialogue must occur between privacy and consumer advocates, and 
the private sector, before privacy policies and practices can be identified.  
Once identified, privacy policies and practices can guide and influence the 
development and deployment of new technologies to our collective benefit.   
<p>
A consensus emerged last year among policy makers, businesses, and 
privacy advocates that personally identifiable transaction data deserves 
strong legal protection, akin to the protections we afford content.3  However, 
the consensus centered on limiting law enforcement access to transaction data, and failed to address the significant privacy issues posed by the private 
sector's use of this identifiable data.  Before people will fully and openly take 
advantage of the new communications technologies and applications, they 
must have trust and confidence that their expectations of privacy and security 
are not undermined.  As John Markoff concluded in the New York Times  last month, "The recent rush to the Internet by companies seeking to exploit its commercial possibilities has obscured the fact that giving the system a new 
purpose has unearthed fundamental problems that could well put off true 
commercial viability for years."4  A recent poll conducted for CommerceNet 
found that even though Internet use is growing, "a wide variety of businesses 
selling goods on the Internet have been disappointed so far, hindered by 
security issues and a cautious attitude about commerce on the Internet among 
consumers.
<p>
We must seize the opportunity to move beyond the current debate over 
the intrusive nature of technology to embrace the technology's capacity to 
empower individuals to exercise meaningful choice over  the disclosure and 
use of personal information.  In the traditional information privacy realm, 
various interests have wrestled with awkward, mechanistic, and largely 
unsuccessful approaches to allowing people some say over how and whether 
their personal information should be used by others.  We debate the merits of 
"opt-in" over "opt-out," and how to categorize "sensitive" information.  We 
argue over who "owns" information, and whether one is a privacy 
"fundamentalist" or a privacy "pragmatist."  Essentially, privacy and consumer advocates have been engaged in a tug of war with the communications and information industries for control over personal information. 
<p>
This is not to say that these "tugs" have not produced results that 
benefit privacy and free speech, as well as commerce.5  However, interactivity 
provides us with the opportunity to fashion a truer privacy paradigm that 
promotes individual choice and empowerment, robust speech, more secure 
communications and transactions, and vigorous commerce.  For instance, 
interactivity makes possible real-time notice and choice options that 
acknowledge a direct relationship between individuals and the companies 
with which they do business.  Notice and choice options can be presented at 
varying levels of granularity, depending on the individual's desire at the time of a particular transaction.  Interactions can once again be tailored by and for the individual.  
<p>
As the recent Department of Commerce report, "Privacy and the NII: 
Safeguarding Telecommunications-Related Personal Information," concluded:  
<blockquote>"The promised interactivity of the NII may diminish the need to make a policy choice between opt-in and opt-out. Such interactivity would make it possible for service providers to obtain consent to use [transaction-related personal information] from subscribers electronically before any services were rendered."6</blockquote>
<p> 
Today, the privacy potential of interactive technology remains 
largely hidden and untapped.   Unique facets of this new medium can be bent 
to advance privacy and encourage full and open participation.   A range of 
policy and technical options will be discussed in greater detail in the "New 
Privacy Paradigm" section of this paper. 
<p>
<h3>II.  WHY IS PRIVACY IMPORTANT?</h3>
<p>
Before launching into a discussion of privacy, we must begin by defining 
the term.  The difficulty of defining privacy and its underlying principles has 
stymied and paralyzed policy makers and philosophers.  One privacy scholar 
who has written on privacy issues for decades resorted to defining it in these 
visceral terms: "You know it when you lose it." 7  Yet defining privacy and its 
value to individuals and society is essential if we are to develop cohesive, 
rational information privacy policies.  We must understand why preserving 
and enhancing privacy is an ultimate "good" before we can expect policy 
makers, the private sector, and privacy and consumer advocates to reach 
some common ground on core privacy principles and their application.
<p>
Information privacy is defined here as incorporating two components, at 
times distinct and at times inextricable.  The first component is the right to 
retreat from the world; one's family, neighbors, community, and government.  This component allows us to shield ourselves, physically and psychologically, from the prying eyes of others. We think of this privacy value, as it was initially described by Justice Louis Brandeis over a century ago, as "the right to be let alone." 
<p>
The second component of privacy is the right to control information 
about oneself, even after divulging it to others.  This component acknowledges the critical value of being able to step forward and participate in society without having to relinquish all control over personal information.  As Professor Alan Westin first defined it in Privacy and Freedom, to  maintain privacy in modern times, individuals need to "determine for one's self when, how, and to what extent information about one's self is communicated to others."8  
<p>
Privacy as defined here allows individuals to choose when to withdraw 
and when to participate.  People must be able to seek solitude and isolation 
from others to develop a sense of one's self apart from others.  Developing 
one's unique identity is critical to a person's ability to form his or her own 
thoughts and opinions, and to establish intimate connections with others.  A 
society that preserves privacy for its people is one that acknowledges the 
individual's interest in maintaining control over his or her life.  One aspect of this control is being able to determine the presentation of one's self, or various pieces of one's self, to others.  A person who is unable to truly retreat feels constantly watched, dehumanized, and powerless to make fundamental 
decisions affecting his or her life.9  Equally important to having the capacity to retreat from society, is having the ability to step forward to participate in the affairs of society.  It is axiomatic that an individual's willingness to engage in the activities of the community will be tempered by the degree to which he or  she is able to maintain control over the development and presentation of one's self.10  In the absence of control over the development of one's self, individual autonomy and self-determination are eroded.
<p>
An emblem of a vibrant, participatory democracy is the ability of people 
to develop as individuals, separate and distinct from one another, with the 
confidence to hold and express their own political opinions, beliefs and 
preferences.  A free society tolerates -- even revels in -- such individuality, 
recognizing it as the bedrock of an open society.
<p>
Once divulged, bits of personal information can reveal what we think, 
believe, and feel.  Personal information, disclosed over a period of time in a 
variety of circumstances, can be culled to create a "womb to tomb dossier."  As 
people lose the ability to control how others see them, and judgments are 
made about them based on information gathered third hand, people grow to 
distrust information-gathering entities.  People become reticent to fully 
communicate for fear the information will be used for unintended purposes, 
and they may ultimately lose confidence in their ability to participate in a 
range of traditional and emerging settings.11  Buttressing these conclusions, a 
number of recent polls document peoples' growing concerns that their privacy is increasingly threatened as they lose control over personal information.12
<p>	
In this context, privacy means controlling who can know what about us.  
It means that we, as individuals, can regulate the flow of personal 
information, whether we are alone, in social settings, business transactions 
and, to a less absolute extent, to the government.  The following section is a 
brief review of the current state of privacy law and practice, which will serve 
as the foundation for a proposal for a new privacy paradigm for the 
interactive age. 
<p>
<h3>IV.  CURRENT PRIVACY PARADIGM</h3>
<p>
In the information age, neither prong of the privacy right (to be let 
alone and to control personal information) has developed in law or practice to preserve or advance individual privacy.  In a paper-based, information-
gathering society in which the individual lacks sufficient bargaining power, 
the notice and consent models have failed to provide people with the ability to make meaningful, uncoerced choices about how much personal information to divulge, and how and whether their information can be used for purposes unrelated to those for which it was initially collected. 
<p>
Over the past thirty years, the United States' information privacy policy 
has been loosely and unevenly patched from a series of Supreme Court 
decisions, federal statutes, executive branch reports, and industry self-
regulation.  The Code of Fair Information Practice Principles developed by the 
Department of Health, Education and Welfare in 1973, has served as the basis 
for much of the information privacy legislation and policy in place today.  The central principle is that information collected for one purpose shall not be used for a different purpose without the individual's consent.  The principle is more extensively discussed than it is applied. 
<p>
Even where the private sector has voluntarily adopted such a consent  
principle, it has fallen short of empowering people to make informed, 
uncoerced choices about secondary information use.  Nevertheless, it is fair to 
say that in theory, a general consensus has developed among many privacy 
and consumer groups, the private sector, and even the government, that 
individuals should be informed of and able to make choices about the 
secondary use of personal information.13   The challenge has always been how to craft workable and enforceable mechanisms to put the policy into 
practice.14  With few exceptions, industry representatives argue vigorously 
that "opt-out" must be the maximum privacy mechanism, which means that 
unless an individual affirmatively objects to a secondary use of information, 
the information gatherer is free to reuse and redisclose personal information.  
As privacy advocates have long argued, the opt-out approach places the 
burden of restricting information use on the individual, and thereby creates a 
presumption that ancillary, unrelated uses of personal information are 
acceptable.  Another criticism leveled at the opt-out mechanism is that it 
insufficiently reflects peoples' true privacy values since such a small 
percentage of people actually exercise the option, attributable to a lack of 
notice, fear of negative consequences, and a reluctance to engage in one more 
step beyond what is minimally necessary to complete a transaction.
<p>
Exacerbating the insufficiency of privacy law and practice is the weak 
state of constitutional jurisprudence in the area of information privacy.  In 
one of its seminal privacy cases, U.S. v. Katz,  the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment protects "people, not places" from unwarranted searches and seizures.15   In Katz,  the Court found that what a person "seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible  to the public, may be 
constitutionally protected" provided the individual has a subjective actual 
expectation of privacy which the society will recognize as reasonable. The 
reasonable expectation is then weighed against the government's interest in 
access, and the extent of the intrusion.
<p>
Although hailed as a landmark privacy decision, the Katz  test has been 
applied in later cases to undermine privacy interests.  In Katz's  progeny, the 
Court has applied the "reasonable expectation" test as a relative standard 
informed by the technological and social realities of the day.  As technology 
has advanced, and as societal demands for sensitive personal information 
have increased, the Court has increasingly circumscribed the "zones" one may justifiably consider private.  Thus in California v. Ciraolo,  the Court held that the use of a fixed-wing aircraft to observe marijuana on defendant's property from 1,000 feet did not violate his protected "zone of privacy" even though he had built a 10-foot fence around his backyard with the intent to shield it from passers-by.16  The Court stated that the defendant's subjective expectation of privacy was not one "that society is prepared to honor  [i]n an age where private and commercial flight in the public airways is routine." 
<p>
Similarly, in California v. Greenwood,  the Court found that people have 
no reasonable expectation of privacy in garbage once it is removed from the 
home and placed on the curb for pick-up, even if a county ordinance requires 
the trash to be placed on the curb and does not allow for disposal in any other 
way.17  The Court reasoned that the defendants deposited their garbage "in an 
area particularly suited for public inspection and for the express purpose of 
having strangers take it" and could not expect Fourth Amendment protection 
for items they "knowingly expose[d] to the public."  
<p>
The "reasonable expectation" test has proven particularly troublesome in 
the information privacy context.  The Court has continually held that 
individuals have no privacy interest in information divulged to the private 
sector, even though modern society leaves citizens no option but to disclose to others (e.g., disclosure as a condition of participation in society and technology accumulating transactional data). 18
<p>
The distinction is blurring between the content of a communication and 
the transactional data generated in the course of a communication.  In the 
nine years since the enactment of ECPA, society's patterns of using 
communications technologies has changed dramatically.  Millions of people 
have electronic mail addresses; large numbers of businesses, nonprofit and 
political groups conduct their work over the Internet; and use of the World 
Wide Web is exploding.  Detailed information about a person's visits to Usenet and World Wide Web sites are logged, and may be used without a person's knowledge. 
<p>
Records of all of these activities -- who sends a message to whom, where 
a given communications device is located, which political party one contacts 
for information, and which online discussion group or virtual community one associates with -- are available both in real time and in stored form as part of the transactional information generated by advanced computer and 
communications networks.  This transactional information reveals almost as 
much about our private lives as would be learned if someone literally 
followed us around on the street.  
<p>
To varying degrees, people expect that this transactional data is 
"private."  There are content-like characteristics to transactional data that 
require it be afforded a level of legal protection akin to content.  In the past 
year, there has been political consensus in support of raising legal protections 
for such increasingly sensitive and unprotected transaction data.  However, so 
far, the legal limits on access apply only to the government. 
<p>
There is increasing urgency to address the private sector's use of 
transactional data.  The NII Advisory Committee's Privacy Principles and the 
NTIA's recent report both conclude that transaction data is entitled to content-like safeguards from the private sector.
<p>
<h3>IV.   NEW PRIVACY PARADIGM</h3>
<p>
New media presents us with the opportunity to more fully realize 
constitutional privacy principles, while fostering free speech and commerce in the digital environment.  We must build in to the technology and its 
applications the capacity to move beyond "opt-in" and "opt-out" to 
mechanisms of meaningful individual choice. Widespread availability of choice options will also reverse the use of the Katz  standard to undermine privacy protections.  If technology can be a tool for people to more easily manifest their subjective privacy expectations, then those expectations are more likely to be recognized by the society (and the Court) as objectively reasonable. 
<p>
In the interactive sphere, technology may be designed to empower 
individuals to gain greater control over their lives by making decisions about 
the use of their personal information.  Those decisions may vary from 
transaction to transaction, depending upon the nature of the transaction, the 
recipient of the personal information, the offers proffered, and a slew of other 
variables.  For instance, some people consider their address to be sensitive 
information.  Others may be unconcerned about disclosures of their phone 
numbers, ages, salaries, or travel patterns.  In the interactive realm, 
technology has the capacity to be the individual's ally, not the intrusive, 
meglomaniacal villain, as it is often perceived. 
<p>
In fact, both privacy prongs can be more fully addressed by interactive 
technologies that allow people to filter out unwanted communications that 
may come into their home, as well as to make choices about the use of the 
personal information they are divulging.  The Caller ID experience is 
instructive here in that technology can be designed to give people greater 
control over both the information they divulge and receive. 
<p>
Interactive technologies can be designed with features that empower 
individuals to control the flow of information.  The initial point of contact is 
ideal for conveying information about the information practices and policies of an information user to the individual and providing them with the ability to make choices concerning the information use.
<p>
Traditional opt-out/opt-in mechanisms for obtaining consent usually 
involve an "all or nothing" approach.  The ease and economy of interactive 
communications offers an opportunity for more granular levels of choice.  
Information collectors and users can more easily ask specific questions, 
request more detailed information, and tailor their requests and responses.  
To some extent, exercising choice in the use of personal information may 
alleviate the fear of surveillance and abuse that makes many individuals 
reticent about using new technologies.   
<p>
An individual must be given clear and conspicuous (up-front) notice of 
information policies and practices in order to make informed choices about 
information uses.  Transparency, a central principle of fair information 
practices, requires that individuals be told about the information that is being 
collected from them, and how it will be used and disclosed.  Software can be 
designed that allows individuals to access additional information about 
information practices, and to actually see the amount of information they are 
revealing by engaging in a given activity.  
<p>
Choice functions that allow individuals to exercise a number of options 
regarding information flow can be used to gather consent to information use 
and to record limits on information use.  Software can be designed to require 
the individual to take an action prior to engaging in a specific activity.19  
Through such choice mechanisms, information users can educate consumers 
about information flow while empowering individuals to take a more active 
role in controlling the information they release and receive.
<p>
As technology options are explored, a number of difficult questions must 
be resolved.  Who in a particular transaction stream is responsible for 
providing the individual with notice and choice?  Whose notice and choice 
decisions apply to whom? For instance, if an individual is using her America 
Online account to access LL Bean and uses her American Express card to buy 
long johns, which company's choice option applies?  From a privacy and 
business standpoint, should the first choice exercised flow with the rest of the 
transaction or do the entities have a justifiable, independent interest in using 
the personal information for their own secondary uses if they have obtained 
consent in a different context?  Will the individual's privacy preferences vary 
across entities? 
<p>
In addition, agents and contractors of the primary entity (such as 
Federal Express, or a billing company) should not be able to assert an interest 
in using the information beyond the purpose for which it was disclosed.
<p>
<h3>V.   DESIGNING, IMPLEMENTING AND ENFORCING USER EMPOWERING TECHNOLOGIES</h3> 
<p>
Technology that empowers individuals to make choices about the use of 
personal information will benefit consumer privacy and ultimately commerce.  Not only does a more informed, active citizenry breed a robust, participatory democracy, but voluntary, knowledgeable participation in the marketplace will lead to more confident consumers.  The opportunity for entities to establish more direct relationships with the individual can lead to a more refined, detailed, useful awareness of the consumer.  As people gain greater trust in the interactive environment, they will be less reticent to participate.  As segments of the private sector already recognize, allowing people to make decisions about the use of personal information is an essential business practice.  Good privacy practices are crucial to individuals, and necessary to foster free speech and commerce.
<p>
Just as industry, researchers and the public interest community have 
joined together to design technologies to empower people to filter out 
objectionable material on the Internet through the Platform for Internet 
Content Selection (PICS), so too can the PICS model be harnessed or expanded 
to include a privacy focus.  The key distinction between the drive to develop a 
non-regulatory solution in the free speech arena and efforts to devise 
privacy-enhancing technologies is that in the former instance we face the 
serious threat of censorship legislation.  In the privacy arena, the private 
sector has a window of opportunity to be one step ahead of the Congress. 
However, as the NTIA report warned, and privacy advocates will demand, 
meaningful, enforceable privacy guidelines and mechanisms must be put in 
place industry-wide.
<p>
<h3>VI.  NEXT STEPS</h3>
<p>
The Center for Democracy and Technology's Privacy Forum, a consortium 
of public interest and private sector organizations, is in the process of 
identifying and developing privacy models and guidelines for transactional 
data and interactive media. The Forum is convening a series of briefings and 
demonstrations to work towards technical and policy options that allow people to make choices about the use of their personal information and 
communications.  At this early stage, the Forum is identifying the extent to 
which personal information is generated and stored in interactive media.  The goal is to develop a set of privacy "rules of the road" that enhance individual choice, foster free speech and other democratic values, and support the continued development of a vibrant Global Information Infrastructure.

<h3>FOCUS - SEX IN CYBERSPACE?</h3>
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> The debate over sex on the  Internet  is next
tonight. The Senate has passed a bill that would ban pornography in
cyberspace. But yesterday, the Speaker of the House of Representatives,
Newt Gingrich, said the ban is a bad idea.
<p>
<b>REP. NEWT GINGRICH, Speaker of the House: [last night]</b> Clearly a
violation of free speech and it's a violation of the right of adults to
communicate with each other, but was I think seen as a good press
release back home so people voted for it.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> The Speaker was referring to a provision in the
sweeping Telecommunications Reform Act passed by the Senate last week.
Its sponsor, Senator  James  Exon,  said it would protect children from
one of the pot holes on the information highway.
 <p>                                                                         
<b>SEN. JAMES  EXON,  [D] Nebraska:</b> I had a remarkable demonstration of
what is readily available to any child with the basic  Internet  access.
It is not an exaggeration to say that the worst, most vile, most
perverse pornography is only a few "click, click, clicks" away from any
child on the  Internet.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> The  Internet  is a global network of smaller
computer networks. An estimated 25 million people are plugged into the 
Internet,  and the number has been doubling every year. Until recently,
access was only available through powerful computers at universities and
government research facilities. But now, dozens of companies offer
access to anyone with a home computer and a modem connected to a phone
line. With that access, users can send E-Mail messages to other users or
search the  Internet  for whatever interests them, the latest satellite
photos from NASA, digitized collections of fine art, information on a
favorite rock band, or the latest medical information on any given
disease or treatment. And along with all the art and science has come
pornography and chat rooms, where people can send messages on any number
of subjects, including sexually explicit ones, to other  Internet 
users. Since the Internet  is a network of users, nobody owns it, nobody
runs it, and up until recently, nobody tried to police it.
<p>
<b>REP. NEWT GINGRICH:</b> I don't agree with it, and I don't think it's a
serious way to discuss a serious issue, which is: How do you maintain
right of free speech for adults while also protecting children in a
medium which is available to both?
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b>The Senate's answer is a bill that would make it a
crime to send obscene or harassing messages on the  Internet.  It would
also impose a $100,000 fine and a two-year prison term on anyone who
made indecent sexual material available to under-age  Internet  users.
Should there be restrictions on the  Internet?  We have two views: Sen.
James  Exon,  Democrat from Nebraska, and Jerry Berman, the executive
director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a non-profit civil
liberties organization based in Washington. Thank you, gentlemen, for
being with us. Sen.  Exon,  let's start with you. I know you can't be
terribly specific on a show like this, but what did you see on the
Internet  that made you want to enact this bill?
<p>
<b>SEN. JAMES  EXON,  [D] Nebraska:</b> [Capitol Hill] Elizabeth, I saw the
opening of your show. If we could show on your program tonight what's
readily available most unfortunately to children on the  Internet,  I
had a book that was downloaded with pictures that I showed to many of my
colleagues in the United States Senate, they did not know this was
available. It's pornography at its worst. It's obscenity at its worst.
And to say it's indecent is an understatement. I wish I could show the
pictures, but you couldn't, and I wouldn't. I simply say the  Exon-Coats
Bill that passed the United States Senate 86 to 14 is a step in the
right direction. It's not a cure-all, but it will provide a deterrent to
stop the profiteering that's going on today that are polluting the minds
of our youth. We can't just sit idly by and say, oh, this is so
complicated we can't do anything about it. I believe maybe -- although
not very many people can tell Newt Gingrich anything these days -- even
I might be able to convince Newt, as I did many others, that sitting
idly by and letting this happen on the  Internet  today is going to have
a serious deterrent to other people getting on the  Internet  to take
advantage of that vast new system to spread knowledge that I'm excited
about. We've got to do something to protect the kids.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b>  Senator,  the Speaker says it's a violation of free
speech. Isn't it?
<p>
<b>SEN.  EXON:</b>  It's not a violation of free speech, and I called on a
lot of well-known lawyers to make sure that this bill could test -- to
be properly tested on the constitutional rights provision. We never know
what the courts are going to do. We based this on the law that has been
in effect and been approved constitutional with regard to pornography on
the telephones and pornography in the U.S. mail. We're not out in
no-man's land. We're running on the record of courts' decisions that
have said you can use community standards to protect especially kids on
telephones and in the mails. We're trying to expand that as   best we
can to the  Internet.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> Mr. Berman, I surfed the  Internet  a little bit
today to see what I could find on it, and I also can't say exactly what
I found on this show, but one of the things I found was a solicitation
for pictures of eight to eleven year old girls having sex with adult
men. What, if anything, should be done about this?
<p>
<b>JERRY BERMAN, Center for Democracy and Technology:</b> First of all, they
ought to be rounded up and prosecuted. The Justice Department is out
there. It has a, a whole division that works on computer crime
prosecution. It should be pointed out that the Justice Department did
not ask for new legislation in this area. They are prosecuting under
current law. Child pornography, bestiality, the most perverse things
that Sen.  Exon  talks about, are violations of the criminal law. What
he fails to point out is that his statute went much broader than that
and would ban the knowing, making available any materials which may be
indecent to anyone under the age of 18. That not only covers pornography
and obscenity, which we all abhor, but it also would cover the
communications between adults where they might be talking about
"Ulysses" or talking about rap music or having a discussion about, about
their sexual preferences. The problem with the Internet,  unlike the
U.S. mails and the telephone system, is that it's not a closed system.
It's not just two people communicating with each other through    a
closed envelope or a closed telephone line. Here, when you communicate
on the Internet,  you make information available, you put it up, and you
put it up and anyone can come and get it. And it's important in this
technology to understand that you have to come and get it. I understand
it may be a few clicks away but you have to come and get it. And that
makes it very different because you know, just simply know that there
are children on the  Internet,  and, therefore, any information that
maybe we would try to communicate between adults could get in the hands
of a child and, therefore, it's a crime. So the only way to clean up the
Internet  is to make it safe only for children.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> What about that problem, Sen.  Exon?  Let's say
there's a discussion among adults about James Joyce's "Ulysses," which
might be considered indecent, and a sixteen-year-old logs on. Won't that
be against the law under your bill?
<p>
<b>SEN.  EXON:</b>  I think Jerry tries to make a case, it's a false case.
Certainly, it would have to be prosecuted by a prosecutor, and the judge
would have to so decide that watching that type of a program that I do
not think under the definition that anyone considers would be
pornographic. That's one of the problems we have with people like Jerry.
They may be well intentioned, but they just don't seem to realize that
we can't sit back and see what you saw on the Internet  today and what
kids are seeing all over. The facts of the matter are that there is
not enough prosecution taking place today.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> But the --
<p>
<b>SEN.  EXON:</b>  The Coats-Exon  Bill will assist in stopping this, but
it won't be a cure-all.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> What about what Mr. Berman said, though, the worry
that only that which is good for kids or which kids can look at will be
on the Internet if, if this bill passes?
<p>
<b>SEN.  EXON:</b>  Well, that's obviously not true. The -- we have --
hardly have a day goes by that what we don't have some case of a kid
being lured away from home, taken advantage of. What you saw today is
replete on the  Internet.  There will be a study coming out very soon
that's going to be widely distributed next week that proves the case
once and again that we've got a disease going on on the Internet 
today. I think that Jerry and his people should work with us to try and
solve this problem, rather than hiding behind the old constitutional
protection once again that simply says anything can go and you dare not
do anything about it because you're going to run afoul of the 
Constitution.  I think that's not reasonable. I think that is not
realistic.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> Mr. Berman, how would you solve the problem?
<p>
<b>MR. BERMAN:</b> Two things. First of all, we tried to work with Sen. 
Exon, and we're still prepared to work with him and others in the House
to draft narrow statute which if there's -- the Justice Department can
show that there's a gap in current law and going after materials that
he's described, but we do not want to leave it to the discretion of
prosecutors all over the United States to decide what may be indecent.
And there are many times and there are places where "Ulysses" would be
considered indecent material, and, therefore, adults will have to have
the chilling effect of not knowing what they can put up on the Net. But
let's go to the real issue. I think that Sen.  Exon  has raised a very
important issue for the American public. The information highway I
stipulate has a lot of material on it which is very troublesome and
which our children should not get ahold of. The problem is that we
should not try to put forward solutions that are really fig leafs that
will not solve the problem. For example, the worldwide  Internet  is a
worldwide network. I don't know where Sen.  Exon downloaded the
materials that he found abhorrent, but if they're downloaded from Sweden
or they're downloaded from Denmark, which looks exactly like any U.S.
site, any law that he passes will not reach it. If you want to -- what
the Speaker is talking about is an approach which says let us really
look at the user end of the  Internet,  what kinds of technologies can
we bring on line to make it possible for parents to screen out and
control what they see or what they interact with on the Net and what
their children interact with? I have here, for example, a software
[holding up "Surf- Watch"] which is available on the market which
screens out adult sexual material. You just put it in with your
computer, and it keeps your kid out. America On-Line and other
information services are trying to put screening technology -- in fact,
they have screening technology and lock-out technology bundled into the
America On-Line, and they are trying to update that. The industry really
will respond. The problem, by bringing these technologies on board, what
Rep. Cox and Widen in the House, along with the Speaker, realize that
while Sen.  Exon's  bill is well-intentioned, it was drafted in a way
which creates disincentives for industry to do this kind of policing.
Under his legislation, if an  Internet provider like America On-Line
tried to control information, they are -- they cannot rely on the
defenses in the legislation for prosecuting of someone other than them
who puts up content.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> Okay, let me ask the  Senator  about this. First of
all, Sen. Exon,  on the question of user, policing this by policing the
user, by using a technology which can block it for the user, a parent
could put something in their computer and make it impossible to get
Penthouse Magazine, which I read is the No. 1 site on the  Internet 
now, what's wrong with that?
<p>
<b>SEN.  EXON:</b>  There's nothing wrong with that. We didn't hear much
about that until the  Exon Decency Bill was widely considered and
debated. Yes, we have gotten the intention, and it may well be that
eventually -- although I am convinced that there's no way to filter out
all of this material. Let's take the case that Jerry just used. Let's
say that Mom and Dad could lock out on their computer, which you can't
do now, and Jerry knows you can't do it now, and there's nothing
available on the market today that would begin to take out everything
that is pornographic and obscene, but I'm certainly not saying that they
shouldn't try that. I don't believe that's going to work or be
effective. One of the problems that we have today is we tried to work
with Jerry, but we found out that basically Jerry goes back to the old
idea that I think is kind of foreign that Thomas Jefferson and all of
the good people who wrote the Constitution  worked overnight and planned
and plotted to make sure that the Constitution  protected the most gross
pornographers, pedophiles, those who are trying to lure children today.
Children can get this information outside the home. They can get it in
the schools. They can get it in the libraries. They can get it at the
neighbors. I wish that we could wake up, and maybe if I could get to
Newt Gingrich, maybe if he would at least look at the material that I
have and take a look at our bill that is not nearly as restrictive as
Jerry would like to believe it is, maybe we could solve the problem.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> Mr. Berman, we have just a few seconds for a
response.
<p>
<b>MR. BERMAN:</b> Yes. But I'm sorry if I'm -- if I am associated with the
gang that goes back to Thomas Jefferson, I'm quite proud of that
association. We need to draft careful legislation here which is not
thrown out by the Supreme Court. We need to look at these technology
solutions. We should not pass bandaids. We should not go for press
releases, and I think the  Senator  has raised important issues. I think
he would -- it would behoove him to work with industry on the user
controls. That is the only effective way to deal with pornography on the
Internet.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b>  Senator,  Mr. Berman, thank you for being with us.

Madame Chairwoman and Members of the Committee:</a>
<p>
<h3>I.  OVERVIEW</h3>
<p>
My name is Janlori Goldman and I am the Deputy Director of the 
Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT).  I appreciate the 
opportunity to testify before you today on behalf of CDT in support of  the 
Medical Records Confidentiality Act of 1995, (S.1360).  
<p>
CDT is a non-profit, public interest organization founded by civil 
liberties advocates to advance public policies protecting civil liberties and 
democratic values in the development of new media.  One of CDT s 
primary goals for the 104th Congress is the passage of federal legislation 
that establishes strong, enforceable privacy protection for personally 
identifiable health information.  We believe the need for such legislation is 
the most critical information privacy issue facing our country today. 
Further, the passage of a medical records confidentiality bill should be 
viewed as an essential stepping stone to achieving other health care 
reform goals. The public will not have trust and confidence in the emerging 
health information infrastructure if  their sensitive health data is 
vulnerable to abuse and misuse. We strongly support  S.1360, and applaud 
Senators Robert Bennett and Patrick Leahy, as well as the bill's co-
sponsors for their strong leadership towards enacting medical 
confidentiality records legislation this Congress.
<p>	
At present, there is no comprehensive federal law to protect peoples' 
health records. However, a Louis Harris survey found that most people in 
this country mistakenly believe their personal health information is 
currently protected by law.  And most people mistakenly believe they have 
a right to access their own medical information.  In fact, only 28 states 
allow patients access to their own medical records and 34 states have 
conflicting confidentiality laws.  A federal privacy policy is urgently needed 
to address the fact that the traditional doctor-patient relationship is being 
intruded upon by increasing demands for health information.  CDT 
believes Congress must act to protect personally identifiable health 
information so that the reality of our laws will finally conform, to some 
extent, with the perception and desires of the American public.
<p> 	
To that end, CDT has been working with a diverse coalition of 
privacy and consumer advocates, health policy specialists and industry 
representatives, to develop a consensus on privacy policy for personally 
identifiable health information (see attached letter to Senator Bennett).  
This consortium of groups has operated with a keen understanding of the 
advances in technology today.
<p>	
The societal impact of technological innovations,  including those 
that allow medical records, data and images to be transferred easily over 
great distances, is felt across our country in significant ways.  The 
development of a national information infrastructure and information 
superhighway are changing the ways we deal with each other.  
Traditional barriers of distance, time and location are disappearing as 
information and transactions become computerized, and few relationships 
in the health care field will remain unaffected by these changes.  In the 
absence of any Congressional action on S.1360, the collection and use of 
personally identifiable health information will continue to occurr within 
electronic networked environments without privacy protections.  
<p>	 
 But while this information revolution may hold great promise for 
enhancing our nation's health, CDT and others who support S.1360 
believe that personal health information, in both paper and electronic 
form, must be handled within enforceable privacy rules.  Even useful 
technologies  pose potential risks, as conflicts may arise between an 
individual's  need to keep health information confidential and the 
economic opportunities posed by the computerization of health records, 
from lowering the cost of processing insurance claims to selling personal 
medical records for marketing purposes. 	
<p>	
Confidentiality must not be an afterthought in the design and use of 
information systems.  A provision known as "administrative 
simplification" has been included in the House-passed budget 
reconciliation bill and mandates that certain personal health information 
be reported in standardized, electronic form.  Although"administrative 
simplification" fosters the development of networked health information 
databases, the provisioin is silent on privacy.  Without protections such as 
those incorporated in S.1360, CDT believes the "administrative 
simplification" section should not become law.  
<p>	
CDT strongly supports the Medical Records Confidentiality Act as 
the most comprehensive and strong privacy bill the Congress has yet 
considered in this area.  Similiar legislation was widely supported by both 
Republicans and Democrats during last Congress' effort to enact health 
care reform.  We commend Senator Bennett,  Senator Leahy and this 
Committee for the leadership and commitment you have shown on this 
important legislation.  Our testimony today outlines the need for this 
legislation, discussion of S.1360, and our recommendations for 
<a name = "need">strengthening and clarifying several sections of the bill.</a> 
<p>
<p>
<h3>II.  THE NEED AND DEMAND FOR FEDERAL PRIVACY PROTECTION</h3>
<p>
<b>A.  Consensus Exists</b>
<p>
A consensus exists that federal legislation is needed to protect the 
privacy of personal health care records.  At a conference in Washington, 
D.C. two years ago, co-sponsored by the U.S. Office of Consumer Affairs, 
the American Health Information Management Association, and Equifax, 
nearly every panelist and member of Congress supported the need for 
making privacy an integral part of the health care reform effort underway 
at that time.  In agreement were panelists from the American Medical 
Association, CIGNA Health Care, the U.S. Public Interest Research 
Group, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility and IBM.
<p>	
At the conference, Louis Harris and Associates released their Health 
Information Privacy Survey, prepared with the assistance of Dr. Alan 
Westin, a privacy expert at Columbia University.  The survey found that 
the majority of the public (56%) favored the enactment of strong 
comprehensive federal legislation governing the privacy of health care 
information.  In fact, eighty-five percent (85%) said that protecting the 
confidentiality of medical records was absolutely essential or very 
important to them.  Most people wanted penalties imposed for 
unauthorized disclosure of medical records (96%), guaranteed access to 
their own records (96%), and rules regulating third-party access. 
<p>	
A 1992 Harris survey showed that while a large majority of people 
recognize the benefits to society of innovative technology, nearly nine out 
of ten people believe computers make it easier for someone to improperly 
obtain confidential personal information.  Twenty-five percent of the 
public believe they have been the victim of an improper disclosure of 
personal medical information.
<p>	
In addition, a number of federal studies have concluded that a 
federal law is needed to protect peoples' medical records. In 1994, the 
Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) issued a report entitled  Protecting 
Privacy in Computerized Medical Information,  which addresses the 
effects of the computerization of medical records on people's privacy.  In 
recommending comprehensive federal legislation, OTA found that:
<p>
<blockquote>[t]he expanded use of medical records for non treatment purposes exacerbates the shortcomings of existing legal schemes to protect 
privacy in patient information.  The law must address the increase in 
the flow of data outward from the medical care relationship by both 
addressing the question of appropriate access to data and providing 
redress to those who have been wronged by privacy violations.  Lack 
of such guidelines, and failure to make them enforceable, could affect 
the quality and integrity of the medical record itself.  (OTA Report, p.  
44).</blockquote>
<p>
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Science 
released a study that focused on the risks and opportunities associated 
with protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personally-identifiable 
health data.  The IOM report recommended that Congress enact 
legislation to preempt state laws to establish a uniform requirement for 
the confidentiality and protection of privacy rights for personally-
identifiable health data, and specify a Code of Fair Health Information 
Practices to ensure a proper balance between required disclosures, use of 
data, and patient privacy.  
<p>	
Most recently, Professor Larry Gostin concluded that a federal 
preemptive statute based on fair information practices was necessary to 
protect personal privacy as networked health information databases are 
growing. (80 Cornell Law Review 451 (1995). 
<p>	
 All these efforts represent a tremendous pulling together of the 
public and private sector to achieve a critical goal -- the passage of a 
health records confidentiality law.  Nearly twenty years ago there was 
similar pressure to craft a medical records privacy law.  In 1977, the 
federal Privacy Protection Study Commission issued a report 
recommending legislation to protect private sector records, including 
medical and insurance records.  The Commission's recommendations 
sparked a Congressional effort to enact a medical records privacy bill.  In 
1980, due in part to pressure from the law enforcement community for 
unfettered access to health records, the legislative effort failed.
<p>
<b>B.  Negative Consequences</b>
<p>
The unauthorized disclosure of personal health information can 
have disastrous consequences.  New York Congresswoman Nydia 
Velazquez won her House seat only after overcoming the results of an 
unauthorized disclosure.  Her medical records -- including details of a bout 
with depression and suicide attempt -- were faxed to a New York 
newspaper and television station during her campaign.
<p>	
More common, and in some ways more troubling than the well-
publicized privacy invasions of public figures, are the consequences 
suffered by ordinary individuals whose privacy has been compromised by 
the disclosure of medical information.
<p>	
In one instance, a journalist disguised himself as a doctor, obtained 
an actress  medical record and published that she had been treated for a 
sexually transmitted disease.  In another case, a physician at a large New 
York City medical school logged on to a computer system, discovered that 
a nurse was pregnant, and proceeded to publicize that information.  Also, 
a Colorado medical student sold medical records to attorneys practicing 
malpractice law.  These are just a few of the more well known stories; 
undoubtedly there are millions of similar breaches that occur either 
without the knowledge of the individuals harmed or outside the media's 
spotlight.  	
<p>	
Further, errors in peoples  medical records have been difficult to 
correct and control.  For instance, Mary Rose Taylor of Springfield, 
Massachusetts went without health insurance for a year and a half 
because of a computer error at the Medical Information Bureau (MIB), a 
clearinghouse of medical information kept by insurance companies.  MIB 
reported that Ms. Taylor had an abnormal urinalysis, even though she had 
only undergone a blood test.  Ms. Taylor was forced to go to the insurance 
commissioner of her state to have the error corrected before she could 
finally receive health insurance.
<p>	
Despite the public and private horror stories, many Americans trust 
that the information they share with their doctor is kept private.  Indeed, 
the traditional nature of the doctor-patient relationship is intended to 
foster trust and to encourage full disclosure.  However, once a patient's 
information is submitted to a third-party payor, or to any other entity, the 
ethical tie between doctor and patient evaporates.  In fact, in a particularly 
telling statistic, 93% of those termed  "leaders"  in the Harris survey, 
including hospital CEOs, health insurance CEOs, physicians, nurses, and 
state regulators, believe that third party payors need to be governed by 
detailed confidentiality and privacy policies.
<p>	
Within our current health care system, many people try to protect 
themselves against potential privacy violations.  Some people routinely 
ask doctors to record a false diagnosis because they fear their employer 
may see their health records.  Some people don t even tell their doctors 
everything about their medical condition for fear of losing control over this 
sensitive information.  In psychiatric practices, it is common for many 
patients to ask doctors not to take notes during sessions for fear such notes 
could be leaked or even obtained legally with a subpoena.  And some 
people try to avoid the creation of a record altogether by paying for 
medical services out-of- pocket, even though they are entitled to insurance 
coverage.
<p>	
A few insurers have been candid enough to concede that their 
primary business relationship is with the employer/customer and not the 
employee/patient.  These insurers may be reluctant to disclose 
individually-identifiable health information if requested by an employer, 
but they will comply if pressed.  No federal law prevents disclosures by 
insurers to employers.  Most patients, of course, believe the fiduciary 
relationship is between themselves and their doctors, and don't realize 
that a third party with no direct relationship to their medical treatment  
actually controls the information.  It is intolerable to support a system in 
which an employer's payment of a portion of employees  health care 
premiums, a normal part of most American employees  compensation 
packages, amounts to employers controlling their employee's  health 
records.
<p>	
The problems that arise because of a lack of uniform, federal privacy 
protection for identifiable health information are often exacerbated by 
advances in technology.  For example, at the state and local level today, 
employers, insurers, and health care providers are forming coalitions to 
develop automated and linked health care systems containing lifetime 
health histories on millions of Americans.  The primary goals of these 
projects are cost reduction and improved quality of care.  
<p>	
Attempts are being made in some state coalitions to address the 
privacy, confidentiality and security of health data by crafting internal 
guidelines, regulations and contracts.  In addition, in those states where 
the automation of health care information is seen as a key component of a 
state's health care reform package, state legislatures and public agencies 
are attempting to enact legislation that establishes a right of privacy in 
personally identifiable health care information.  These states are also 
attempting to design effective enforcement penalties and oversight 
mechanisms to monitor the information practices of these newly created 
health data systems.
<p>	
The outcome of this piecemeal, state by state, approach to protecting 
the privacy and security of health care information will be conflict among 
the states and a setback for the overall goal of privacy protection.  
Relegating the protection of health care information to the states'  
different guidelines, policies and laws leaves individuals subject to 
differing degrees of privacy depending upon where they receive their 
health care.  In some instances, this means that individuals traveling 
across county or state lines to receive necessary medical treatment may 
lose their ability to control how their personal medical information is used.  
Moreover, states and local governments with different rules governing 
the use of health care information may be prevented from sharing health 
care information contained in their systems with neighboring states that 
insufficiently protect privacy.
<p>	
Health care records, in both paper and electronic form, deserve 
privacy protection.  But the vulnerability of information to unauthorized 
use grows exponentially as the computer makes possible the instant 
sharing of information.  As a 1992 study by the Workgroup for Electronic 
Data Interchange (WEDI) pointed out:  "The paper medium is cumbersome 
and expensive . . . Ironically, it is the  negative  impact of the paper 
medium . . . that has minimized the risk of breaches of confidentiality.  
Although a breach could occur, if someone gave access to health records or 
insurance claim forms, the magnitude of the breach was limited by the 
sheer difficulty of unobtrusively reviewing large numbers of records or 
claim forms. "
<p>	
Nevertheless, technology itself  is not the evil.  Information systems 
can actually be designed to promote the confidentiality and security of 
personal information.  For instance, a computerized system can sometimes 
be more closely guarded through technological devices than paper systems 
can sometimes be protected from prying eyes.  The key is to recognize 
technology's potential to enhance privacy, not simply to focus on the risks 
technology poses to undermine privacy. There is widespread agreement 
among privacy and security experts that protections must be built in on the 
front-end; it is too difficult and risky to try to add them after the fact.  
Privacy and security must be viewed as the foundation on which health 
<a name = "act">information networks are created.  Only then can we</a> acheivethe potential for enhancing privacy and security. 
<p>
<p>
<h3>III.  THE MEDICAL RECORDS CONFIDENTIALITY ACT</h3>
<p>
CDT strongly supports the Medical Records Confidentiality Act.  In 
particular, we support provisions in the bill that:
<p><ul>
<li>Gives people the right to see, copy, and correct their own 
medical records;
<p>
<li>Limits disclosure of personal health information by requiring 
an individual's permission prior to disclosure of his or her 
health information by doctors, insurance companies, and other 
health information "trustees";
<p>
<li>Requires the development of safeguards for the use and 
disclosure of personal health information;
<p>
<li>Creates a warrant requirement for law enforcement access to 
peoples' health records;
<p>
<li>Imposes strict civil penalties and criminal sanctions for 
violations of the Act, and provides individuals with a private 
right of action against those who mishandle their personal 
medical information; and
<p>
<li>Preserves state and federal laws that may be more privacy protective in certain areas, such as public and mental health.</ul>
<p>
 Without protections such as those embodied in S.1360, the rise of 
patchwork regulation and the widespread electronic transmission of 
records will produce the worst of both worlds--confusion and red tape for 
<a name = "recs">legitimate data users, aswell as debilitating fear and mistrust for people </a>seeking medical care.  
<p>
<h3>IV.  RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>
<p>
CDT  believes that the Medical records Confidentiality Act 
represents a vast improvement on current law. Nevertheless, we urge that 
the bill be strengthened and clarified in a number of area, most notably by 
1)requiring consent for disclosure to health researchers; 2)heightening the 
warrant requirement for law enforcement access; and 3)narrowing the 
scope of the oversight section.  
<p>
<b>A. Health Research</b>
<p>
S.1360 currently allows researchers to receive protected health 
information without first obtaining an individual's authorization. We 
believe this is an unnecessarily broad exception and should be rewritten to 
incorporate a consent model.
<p>	
We acknowledge that in some instances the use of records for health 
research may be a legitimate exception to the bill's authorization 
requirements.  But CDT does not believe that the exceptions for research 
should be made broadly or routinely.  Research does not usually require the 
release of identifiable data; anonymous non-identifiable data are often 
sufficient.  In fact, research does not usually require the release of 
identifiable data without consent; it is often possible to get consent easily 
and prospectively.  
<p>	
CDT recommends that the research section be amended to require an 
individual's authorization prior to disclosure of personally identifiable 
information. We urge the committee to consider an analagous situation in 
which federal regulations that apply to NIH-funded biomedical research 
presume that consent will be obtained for use of personal medical records.  
Under those regulations, the nonconsensual release of records is only 
allowed when such records are required for the research to be effective, 
consent would be infeasible, and the project s significance outweighs the 
intrusion into privacy.  
<p>
The regulations have worked well for years at institutions funded by 
the NIH.  Since they acknowledge an individual's privacy interest while 
recognizing the value of research, we would urge the Committee to 
review them and to incorporate similar provisions in the bill.
<p>
<b>B.  Oversight</b>
<p>
We believe that the use of records for authorized oversight functions 
may be a legitimate exception to the general rule of nondisclosure.  
However, we are concerned about the breadth of the exception currently 
in S.1360.  As drafted, the oversight provisions of the bill have an almost 
undefined reach and could be over zealously extended.  We recommend 
tightening this section by requiring oversight officials to obtain an 
administrative summons or subpoena for access to identifiable records.
<p>	
We want to emphasize the importance of the general and specific 
limitations that are already in the bill.  Under the general privacy rules of 
the bill, health oversight agencies cannot re-disclose identifiable 
information for other purposes not specially authorized.  In addition, a 
health oversight agency may not use the information gathered in its 
oversight role for any actions against an individual other than those 
arising out of receipt or payment for health care or fraud.  
<p>	
With the inclusion of a legal process for access to identifiable 
information, CDT believes the bill will come closer to striking a fair 
balance between individual privacy and the government's legitimate needs 
to conduct audits and control fraud.
<p>
<b>C.  Law Enforcement </b>
<p>
CDT strongly supports the creation of warrant requirement for law 
enforcement access to personal health records currently in S.1360. 
However, we urge that the proposed probable cause standard be 
heightened to equal the standard now in place for access to cable 
subscriber records. Under the Cable Communications Act of 1984, a 
warrant can not be issued for access to subscriber records until law 
enforcement can show "clear and convincing evidence that the subject of 
the information is reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity 
and the information sought would be material evidence in the case." We 
believe that federal privacy protection for peoples' medical records should 
<a name = "concl">be at least as strong-- if not stronger-- than we apply to peoples' cable</a> records.
<p>
<b>V.  CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
CDT believes the protection of personally identifiable health 
information is critical to ensuring public trust and confidence in the 
emerging health information infrastructure. Health care reform cannot 
move forward without assuring the American public that the highly 
sensitive personal information contained in their medical records will be 
protected from abuse and misuse. As the Harris surveys indicate, people 
are highly suspicious of large scale computerization and believe that their 
health records are in dire need of privacy protection. If people are 
expected to embrace and participate in a reforming health environment, 
the price of their participation must not be the loss of control of sensitive 
personal information.
<p>	 
In the end, any system that fails to win the public's trust will fail to 
win the public's support, and we risk having individuals withdraw from 
full and honest participation in their own health care. To allow people to 
fall through the cracks because their privacy is not fully protected is too 
serious a matter to continue to go unaddressed by the Congress. We urge 
you to continue your commitment to moving forward with this critical 
legislation.
<p>	
We have come a great distance in achieving broad consensus on the 
principles of health information privacy  and we look forward to working 
with you to refine and enact S. 1360.

<title>Conservative Libertarian Groups Support Cox/Wyden/White Approach</title>
</head>
<body>
<br>
<br>
November 7, 1995
<p>
The Honorable John McCain<br>
United States Senate<br>
Senate Russell Office Building 241<br>
Washington, D.C. 20510<br>
<p>
<p>
Dear Senator:
<p>
Telecommunications conferees are currently assessing how best to protect children and others from exposure to offensive or dangerous on-line material.  The conferees are considering two sharply different proposals.  
<p>
The Exon-Coats amendment adopted by the Senate requires the FCC to regulate cyber-speech -- policing all obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or indecent material.  Violators of this nebulous standard could receive fines as high as $100,000 and jail sentences of up to two years.  
<p>
The Cox-Wyden-White amendment adopted by the House of Representatives explicitly bars the FCC from regulating in any way communications on the Internet.  Instead, it frees on-line service providers from legal obstacles that heretofore have prevented these companies from screening and filtering content as they see fit, or empowering their customers to do so.
<p>
We are writing to express our strong support for the Cox-Wyden-White approach.  Intrusive content regulation of cyber-speech will unduly chill free expression and needlessly undermine the vitality of the on-line/Internet market at the very time that the marketplace is addressing the concerns that motivate the supporters of the Exon/Coats amendment.
<p>
We believe that any new law in this area should:
<p><ul>
<li>recognize the important societal interest in fostering free expression; 	
<li>clearly identify proscribed content;
<li>target and punish active wrongdoers, not passive actors such as access and service
providers; 
<li>when in doubt, favor the market over government intervention; 
<li>recognize that cyberspace is an evolving market with enormous potential to benefit all
Americans; and, 
<li>build on strong market incentives for on-line and other firms to empower parents to
control the material their families receive.
</ul><p>
We urge all conferees to examine carefully the marketplace solutions that are available today or will be in the very near future before rushing headlong into regulating this nascent industry.  Software that blocks out obscene and indecent content is already available and is rapidly being improved.  It is offered to subscribers at no additional cost by companies such as America Online, Inc.  An industry consortium working with MIT will soon make available standard protocols that will permit individuals and third parties to screen and filter out any objectionable content on the Internet.  
<p>
While we are all still discovering the true potential of the Internet and on-line services, there can be little doubt that intrusive regulation is unnecessary and will have unintended effects.  We urge the conferees to give due weight to First Amendment concerns as they grapple with these important issues.  The fundamental issues implicated in this first attempt to regulate content in cyberspace are not new.  The same balancing of interests in free speech against interests in suppressing obscene or otherwise unprotected speech have long been debated for print media.  There is no good policy reason, nor any principled legal justification, for treating closed electronic media like on-line services any differently.
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>

<title>Communications Daily Coverage of Industry/Public Interest Objections to DigTel Surveillance Capacity Request</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
<h2>From Communications Daily, Thursday January 18, 1996</h2>
<h3><i>Posted with permission from Warren Publishing</i></h3>
<p>
<h3>Actual Numbers Needed</h3>
<p>
<center><h3>FBI PRESSED BY INDUSTRY FOR BETTER WIRETAP DATA</center></h3>
<p>
<font size = +1>Telecom industry told FBI that it couldn't comply with Bureau's needs for increased wiretap capacity unless it gets some figures that clearly define what agency's needs will be. In comments submitted to FBI Jan. 16, several telecom industry organizations, as well as Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT), which filed jointly with Center for National Security Studies, said that FBI's foray into notice-and -comment process was woefully unsuccessful because Bureau had failed to provide adequate information. USTA said: "Companies need to know precisely what is involved in complying with the law. They cannot afford a lack of specificity which could result in inadvertent non-compliance."
<p>
FBI last fall sought comments on implementing Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA). In Oct. 16 <i>Federal Register</i>  notice, FBI asked for comment on how much switching capacity industry should reserve for wiretapping of advanced digital telephony systems. however, terms FBI used in expressing its needs in terms of percentages of "engineered capacity" puzzled telecom industry then, and do so today. USTA said that basis FBI used for its proposal wasn't related to network design principles used in telecom industry and as result industry couldn't respond adequately to FBI's proposals. Commenters told FBI that agency is required by law to set out actual and maximum numbers of wiretaps that will be needed, as well as providing historical data to back up requirements. FBI has complied with neither, commenters said.
<p>
USTA noted that requirements for wiretaps, pen registers and trap-and-trace devices must be provided on a switch-by-switch basis so that engineers can design into each switch number of intercepts that would be needed. for that number to be accurate, historical information is needed, commenters said. USTA argued that FBI's Oct. 16 proposals "bear no rational relationship to past law enforcement needs. Some member companies report that the proposed percentage capacity requirement would require setting aside for law enforcement purposes several times the historic electronic surveillance needs." NTCA said FBI proposal could put unfair burden on small telcos. CDT said that Bureau promised to make available historical data, but hasn't yet done so. Agency must make public basis for its request before law can be implemented, CDT said, adding that data are necessary for public accountability.
<p>
Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) said that FBI had promised to make available records of its meetings with industry to help clear up questions and to provide information on standard being developed with Bellcore for electronic surveillance. Neither of those has been published, TIA said, and FBI should consider making separate requirements for each type of wiretap it needs, with capacity for each. Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn. (CTIA) said FBI proposal didn't adequately define responsibilities for existing wireless services, such as cellular networks, or emerging services such as PCS, and hadn't responded to CTIA requests for clarification. </font>

<title>Christian Coalition Pledges to Restrict Access to Porno on the Net</title>
</head>
<body>
<i>From the Christian Coalition "Contract With the American Family", released May 17, 1995 -- page 27 - 28</i>
<p>
<h2>Restricting Pornography</h2>
<p>
<h3>Protecting children from exposure to pornography on the Internet and cable television, and from the sexual exploitation of child pornographers.</h3>
<p>
<b>1. Enactment of legislation to protect children from being exposed to pornography on the Internet</b>
<p>
Pornography, both soft core and hard core, is freely available on the Internet to virtually anyone with a home computer. Several magazines post pornographic images that can be viewed by anyone, including children, for free. There are also numerous sites on the Internet where hard core pornography depicting a variety of explicit acts, even rape scenes and bestiality, are available free and can be accessed with a few clicks of a computer button.
<p>
Christian Coalition urges Congress to enact legislation to protect children from being exposed to pornography on the Internet. Criminal law should be amended to prohibit distribution of, or making available, any pornography,, soft core or hard, to children, and to prohibit distribution of obscene hard core pornography to adults.
<p>
<b>2. Enactment of legislation to require cable television companies to completely block the video and audio on pornography channels to non-subscribers.</b>
<p>
Many children throughout the country are exposed to pornography, often hard core, on cable television because of incomplete scrambling of the signal on pornography channels. Cable companies have asserted that it is the parents' responsibility to guard their children. Christian Coalition believes that the responsibility should be on the cable companies to help parents keep pornography out of their homes. Cable companies should not be allowed to transmit pornography to non-subscribers. We urge Congress to require cable television companies to completely block the video and audio on pornography channels to non-subscribers.
<p>
<b>3. Amending the federal child pornography law to make illegal the possession of any child pornography</b>
<p>
Sexual exploitation of children though child pornography continues to be a major problem in society. Possession of child pornography should be a crime. President Reagan proposed such a law in 1988, hoping that those with collections of child pornography would destroy them for fear of federal prosecution.  In an 11th hour compromise on the bill, however, a conference committee of House and Senate members changed the Reagan bill to criminalize only the possession of "three or more" items of child pornography, videos, magazines, etc. Thus, federal low sanctions the possession of some child pornography -- less than three pieces. A person with two hour-long videotapes depicting the rape of a child cannot be charged with a federal crime, yet a person with three photos depicting a child in a lascivious pose can. Christian Coalition urges that the federal child pornography law should be amended to make illegal possession of any child pornography.

<Title>Senator Leahy Speaks Out Against Online Indecency Bills</title>
</head>
</body>
<p>
<p>
<h2><center>U.S SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY - VERMONT</h2></center>
<p>
<h2>FLOOR STATEMENT OF SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY ON 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE PROPOSALS FOR REGULATING 
SPEECH ON THE INTERNET </h2>
<p>
December 5, 1995
<p>
Parody is becoming reality,  I refer to the debate going on in the 
Telecommunications conference over how to impose government regulation 
over constitutionally protected indecent speech on the Internet.
<p>
Last year, the magazine PC Computing published an April Fool's parody 
saying that I had introduced a bill, number 040194-- for 
April 1, 1994---to ban drinking on the Information Superhighway.  According 
to the article, the imagined bill would prohibit anyone from using a public 
computer network while intoxicated.  The article also noted that a rider was 
added onto this imagined bill to make "it a felony to discuss sexual matters on 
any public-access network, including the Internet, American Online, and 
CompuServe."  Senators were chided for thinking there is a physical highway 
and that a permit was required to "drive" a modem on the Information 
Highway.  The article noted that complaints about the imagined bill are 
"getting nowhere" because "Who wants to come out and support 
drunkenness and computer sex?"  The parody concludes on a gloomy note, 
with the following words:
<p>
<blockquote>"there is nothing to stop this bill from becoming law.  You can 
register your protests with your congressperson or Mr. Lirpa Sloof in the 
Senate Legislative Analysts Office.  Her name spelled backward says it 
all."</blockquote>
<p>
The name spelled backwards is "April Fools."  But many readers could not 
spell backwards, and thought this was a real article.  Unfortunately for my 
staff, many of those readers called my office outraged at the intrusiveness of 
the bill.
<p>
Unfortunately for all Internet users, the debate taking place in the 
telecommunications conference about imposing far-reaching new federal 
crimes for indecent speech over the Internet is not a parody but very real.
<p>
The Telecommunications Conference has been meeting over the past few 
weeks with the enormous task of changing our communications laws to 
allow new competition among phone companies, broadcasters, cable 
operators and the wireless systems while also protecting universal service 
and other appropriate consumer protections.  You would think they would 
have their hands full with just that task.
<p>
Yet, they are also looking at new federal crimes, despite the absence of any 
Senate Judiciary Committee Members on the conference.  As part of the 
telecommunications bill, the Senate passed the Exon-Coats "Communication 
Decency Act," which would punish with two-year jail terms any Internet user 
who posted a message with indecent language or used a four-letter word in a 
message to a minor.  Service providers would also risk criminal language, 
unless the provider adheres to a federally-mandated blocking technology.  
The Christian Coalition has complained that these provisions do not go far 
enough, and is urging the conferees to make the proposed crimes even 
tougher.
<p>
We should not underestimate the effect that the heavy-hand of government 
regulation will have on the future growth of the Internet.  The legislation has 
not even passed and we are seeing that just the threat of it is already having a 
chilling effect on the Internet.  Last week, a Vermonter from Underhill, 
Vermont found that her personal profile on America Online had been 
deleted because she used vulgar words.  In fact, she used AOL to 
communicate with other breast cancer survivors.  what was the vulgar word 
she had used? BREAST.  After many angry complaints, AOL apologized and 
again allowed the word to be used by its subscribers when "appropriate."
<p>
One wonders if, in the future, recipes for Chicken Cacciatore sent online will 
only call for dark meat to avoid using the dreaded "B-" word.
<p>
I understand that proposals are being made to the telecommunications 
conference that would impose even more draconian restrictions for online 
speech than those passed in the Exon-Coats "Communications Decency Act."  
Make no mistake, we already have crimes on the books that apply to the 
Internet, by banning obscenity, child pornography, and threats from being 
distributed over computers.
<p>
Unlike these current laws, which do not regulate constitutionally protected 
speech, certain proposals being considered by the telecommunications 
conference do.  One proposal would impose criminal penalties on anyone 
who transmits indecency--which is protected by the First Amendment--on the 
Internet.  While the proponents of the proposals claim that they do not "ban" 
indecency--only prohibit making it available to minors--the practical result of 
such a restriction on the Internet is the complete criminalization of all 
indecent speech.
<p>
Because indecency means very different things to different people, an 
unimaginable amount of valuable political, artistic, scientific and other 
speech will disappear in this new medium.  What about, for example, the 
university health service that posts information online about birth control 
and protections against the spread of AIDS?  With many students in college 
under 18, this information would likely disappear under threat of 
prosecution.  In bookstores and on library shelves the protection of indecent 
speech is clear, and the courts are unwavering.  Why are some of our 
colleagues trying to alter the protection of the Fist Amendment here and 
cripple this new mode of communication?
<p>
In addition to effectively banning indecent speech, the conference is 
considering proposals to impose criminal liability on both the "speakers" of 
indecent content as well as online service providers.  The result would be to 
draft the service providers into the role of "Net police."  Service providers 
like America Online and Prodigy, telephone companies providing modem 
connections, and libraries and schools hooking our nation's children up to 
this brilliant new medium would face the risk of being fined and even jailed.
<p>
To avoid liability, service providers, libraries and schools would bear the 
onus of asserting complicated defenses to prosecution.  The implications of 
being hauled into court in the first place--especially for schools and libraries--
should not go unnoticed.  Many providers will seek to avoid the risk of 
litigation altogether by censoring all online speech to that appropriate for 
Kindergarten children, or refusing to serve children at all.
<p>
These extreme proposals on the table in the telecommunications conference 
would leave online communications in a severely disadvantaged position in 
our society.  While Newsweek magazine's recent cover story trumpeted the 
vision of the computer mogul Bill Gates, the U.S. Congress is simultaneously 
poised to shut down this new medium and vastly change the landscape of the 
"information age."  We must stop being paternalistic luddites and embrace 
our new communications potential.
<p>
I understand that Representative White will make an alternative proposal to 
the telecommunications conference tomorrow.  His proposal avoids 
regulating constitutionally protected speech, and limits any regulation to 
materials "harmful to minors."  This is a bit of a step in the right direction, 
but still leaves Internet users guessing at what may be considered harmful to 
minors in different areas of this diverse country.
<p>
The Internet and other computer networks hold enormous promise for 
enhancing our lives in ways that would have been unthinkable only a brief 
decade ago.  But the growth of this network will no doubt be chilled if users 
fear that they risk criminal liability by using particular words that might, in 
some jurisdictions, be considered indecent.  Or, if service providers simply 
refuse to provide Internet access to children under 18 years of age, due to the 
risk of criminal liability.
<p>
I have written, along with several other Members, to the Chairman and 
Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce Committee urging the conferees 
to appreciate the implications that these proposals will have for the Internet.  
They should not rush consideration of these weighty issues.  This is a great 
new communications medium and the conference should deliberate carefully 
before it gives its blessing to new crimes, for saying things that some people, 
some where in this country, may deem to be indecent for children.
<p>
We should all be concerned lest the parody becomes a reality.

<b>Re:  Comments on CALEA Capacity Notice, 60 Fed. Reg. 53643 (Oct. 16, 1995)</b>
<p>
Dear Mr. Worthley:
<p>
We hereby submit the following comments in response to the referenced notice.
<p>
<h2>I.	Overview</h2>
<p>
The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, Public Law 103-414) granted the FBI an unprecedented new role in the design of our Nation's telecommunications networks to accommodate electronic surveillance.  In order to protect against abuse, and in order to ensure that the privacy and security of the networks are not compromised, Congress balanced this authority with a detailed public process to ensure oversight and accountability.  
<p>
The FBI's October 16, 1995 Notice of Proposed Surveillance Capacity Requirements fails to meet the public oversight and accountability requirements of the statute.  We urge the FBI to issue a revised notice to include essential information necessary to comply with the public accountability requirements of CALEA and allow interested parties to assess the reasonableness of the FBI's proposal. 
<p>	
A basic question posed by the FBI's October 1995 notice is whether the amount of capacity being proposed is justified in terms of law enforcement's projected needs.  So far, given the ambiguities in the proposal and the FBI's failure to disclose its supporting data, it is impossible to answer that question -- it is impossible to say whether or not the capacity requirements proposed in the notice are justified.
<p>     
Therefore, we must conclude that the FBI's notice is deficient.  The FBI has not yet made available to the public the information necessary for substantive comment on this capacity proposal.  Although the Bureau indicated that such information would be publicly available in advance of the January 16, 1996 comments deadline, the FBI has yet not disclosed:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The factual basis for its proposal, consisting of the historical baseline of surveillance activity, and projections therefrom; 
<P>
<li>Certain details of the proposal that CALEA itself requires to be published, namely, the actual number of expected future surveillances and the geographic locations affected; nor, 
<p>
<li>The definition of a key term, "engineered capacity."  
</ol><p>	
The FBI must make public the basis for, and the details of, its request, as Congress intended, before implementation of CALEA can proceed.  No funds should be appropriated for compliance, nor should carriers be obligated to build increased capacity, until: 
<p>
<ol>
<li>The government has disclosed full information about its proposal;  and,
<p>
<li>Interested parties have been afforded a meaningful opportunity to assess the reasonableness of the capacity proposal.
</ol><p>
A notice of capacity requirements without the above information does not conform to the statute as Congress intended,  nor does it well serve the goal of ensuring public confidence in law enforcement surveillance practices.
<p>
<h2>II.	Public Oversight and Accountability Are a Central Element of CALEA</h2> 
<p>
CALEA is a carefully crafted statute, intended to balance the needs of law enforcement with public concerns over privacy  and security of the nation's telephone system, while not impeding innovation <a href = "#fn1>1</a>.
<p>
In conferring on law enforcement a role in the design of telecommunications systems, and in imposing new functional requirements on telecommunications carriers and equipment manufacturers, Congress was concerned about maintaining the privacy and security of the nation's telecommunications system. Congress sought to address this issue by several mechanisms, including the creation of a public process for determining law
enforcement's surveillance requirements both in terms of capability and capacity <a href = "#fn2">2</a>.  This process was intended to allow privacy advocates and other concerned individuals to have a substantive voice in the compliance process.  The public accountability provisions of CALEA are essential to ensuring that law enforcement and the industry do not take actions that expand surveillance authority or jeopardize the privacy and security of communications not authorized to be intercepted.
<p>
As Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), co-author of CALEA, emphasized during the August 11, 1994 joint House/Senate Judiciary Committee hearing:
<p>
<blockquote>"To allay public concern over the breadth of wiretapping in America, the entire [compliance] process remains subject to public scrutiny, oversight, and accountability. This bill accomplishes this by requiring any standards or technical requirements that industry adopts to ensure wiretap capability be publicly available." (S. HRG. 103-1022, page 111)</blockquote>
<p>
Public accountability is so important to the legislative scheme embodied in CALEA because the statute granted law enforcement a substantial, unprecedented role in the design of new telecommunications systems, equipment and features.  Under CALEA, for the first time ever, telephone companies were required to ensure that their systems satisfied certain law enforcement requirements.  While the development of solutions to maintain traditional interception capabilities was left to industry, it was expected that there would be close consultation between law enforcement and the telecommunications carriers and their suppliers to determine compliance with the requirements.
<P>
CALEA also requires the companies to ensure that their systems have a certain capacity to accommodate simultaneous law enforcement interception requests (CALEA, Section 104 (a)(1)(A). <a href = "#fn3">3</a>.  In terms of capacity, the statute requires even greater specificity on the part of law enforcement to specify precisely what its capacity needs are  <a href = "#fn4">4</a>. 
<p>
<h2>III.	The FBI's Notice Does Not Satisfy the Public Accountability Objectives of CALEA</h2>
<p>
A fundamental principle of CALEA was that it would merely preserve -- and not expand -- traditional law enforcement surveillance capabilities as they existed before the introduction of digital telephony and other advanced features <a href = "#fn5">5</a>.  CALEA requirements were to be based on past levels of surveillance and projections from those levels.  The Deputy Attorney General has recently reconfirmed that the government intends CALEA to produce no increase in surveillance activity.
<p>
Accordingly, the first step in implementation of the law is to determine the past and current needs of law enforcement, as a basis for projecting future needs.  The FBI clearly has accepted this proposition, for its notice states that the proposed capacity requirements are based on a "historical baseline of electronic surveillance activity," derived from reports from telecommunications carriers, law enforcement agencies, and other government entities.  This data has never been collected before.  In the view of the FBI, it provided the starting point for determining what law enforcement's future needs would be.
<p>
Likewise, this baseline data provides a critical basis for the public to evaluate the proposed requirements.  Yet the notice does not disclose either the baseline data or the projections from it.
<p>
A full exposition of the factual basis for the proposed capacity requirements is necessary to implement another component of accountability in CALEA: government reimbursement of capacity costs.  While CALEA authorized funds for implementation, Congress required the FBI to seek yearly appropriations of those funds.  That process allows Congress to have an on-going role in CALEA implementation.  Congress, with public participation, must determine if law enforcement's requests are reasonable, and provide funds accordingly.  The appropriations process also: 
<p>
<ol><li>ensures that the public is aware of the actual costs of government surveillance capacity; and, 
<p>
<li>offers another opportunity for interested parties to challenge law enforcement's surveillance capacity requests.  
</ol><p>
This process will be hampered if the public does not have available the factual information and details making clear what the proposal means.
<p>
<h2>IV.	The FBI's Notice Does Not Satisfy the Express Requirements of CALEA</h2>
<P>
Under CALEA, the FBI is required to determine capacity requirements through a notice and comment procedure (Section 104 (a)).  Congress was very specific in requiring how that process should be conducted <a href = "#fn6">6</a>.  Congress required the FBI to consult with state and local law enforcement agencies.  The FBI has done this.  Congress required the FBI to consult with telecommunications carriers, providers of support services, and manufacturers of telecommunications equipment.  The FBI is doing this.
<p>
But there are two further requirements that the FBI is not complying with.  Congress required the FBI to set forth in its notice "the actual number of communications interceptions, pen registers and trap and trace devices . . . that the Attorney General estimates that government agencies . . .  may conduct and use simultaneously after the date that is 4 years after the date
of enactment."  (CALEA, Section 104(a)(1)(B)). The notice does not include these projected numbers.
<p>
Congress also required that the notice "identify, to the maximum extent possible, the capacity required at specific geographic locations, including carrier office locations." (CALEA, Section 104 (a)(2)(B)).  Again, the notice does not include this statutorily-mandated information.
<p>
<h3>Private Negotiations With Individual Carriers Cannot Substitute for the Explicit Requirements of CALEA.</h3>
<p>
The FBI's apparent intent to negotiate directly with individual carriers, as described in the October 16 Notice,  is directly contrary to the intent of the CALEA and directly violates the public accountability requirements of the statute <a href = "#fn7">7</a>.
<p>
<h3>The Notice is Ambiguous</h3>
<p>
The notice also fails to clearly define a key term, "engineered capacity."  A precise definition of this term is critical to enable the public to accurately assess the scope of the FBI's request. 
<p>
The notice itself defines "engineered capacity as the "maximum number of subscribers that can be served" by a particular switch or other facility.  Subsequent to the issuance of the notice, the FBI has indicated informally that it actually intended "engineered capacity" to refer to the maximum number of subscribers that can be served "simultaneously" by a particular switch or system.
<p>
Because the FBI has proposed to require carriers to reserve a portion of the "engineered capacity" of particular facilities and features for use by law enforcement, the precise definition of "engineered capacity" greatly influences the scope of the FBI's proposed surveillance capacity.  This term must be clearly defined in order to allow interested parties to assess the FBI's request.
<p>
<h2>V.	Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The October 16, 1995 Federal Register notice of proposed capacity requirements does not contain critical information necessary for interested parties to assess the reasonableness of the proposal:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The notice does not disclose the historical baseline data that provide a crucial predicate to the proposal.
<p>
<li>The notice does not describe how the proposed capacity levels correspond to historical surveillance activity.  It is clear that the FBI made some projection from past activity, but, lacking the historical baseline and the methodology for extrapolation to the future,  there is no way to determine whether the projection is reasonable.
<p>
<li>The notice does not specify the "actual number "of expected future intercepts, as required by the statute.
<p>
<li>The notice does not designate the geographic areas to which the capacity requirements apply, again in contravention of CALEA's requirements.
<p>
<li>The notice does not clearly define a key term, "engineered capacity."
</ul><p>
For these reasons, we believe that the proposed notice does not conform to the statutory requirements of CALEA. We recommend that the FBI issue a revised notice with the requested additions, or issue a supplemental notice. Until the FBI complies with the public accountability provisions of the statute and provides interested parties with the information necessary to assess the reasonableness of the FBI's capacity request, Congress should not authorize any funding to cover capacity modifications and telecommunications carriers should not be obligated to comply with the proposed capacity requirements.

This point is detailed in the legislative history of CALEA: "Therefore, the bill seeks to balance three key policies: (1) to preserve a narrowly focused capability for law enforcement agencies to carry out properly authorized intercepts; (2) to protect privacy in the face of increasingly powerful and personally revealing technologies; and (3) to avoid impeding the development of new communications services and <a name = "fn2">technologies".

Congress detailed the public accountability provisions of CALEA in the Judiciary Committee Report:  "Finally, the bill has a number of mechanisms that will allow for Congressional and public oversight. The bill requires that the government estimate its capacity needs and publish them in the Federal Register. The bill requires the government, with funds appropriated by Congress in the normal appropriations process, to pay all reasonable costs incurred by industry in retrofitting facilities to correct existing problems. It requires the Attorney General to file yearly reports on these expenditures for the first six years after date of enactment, and requires reports from the General Accounting Office in 1996 and 1998 estimating future costs of compliance. It requires that the government to reimburse <a name = "fn3">carriers, with publicly appropriated funds, in perpetuity for the costs of expanding capacity to meet law enforcement needs.

<p>
<b>4</b> FBI Director Louis Freeh emphasized this point during an August 11, 1994 joint House/Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on CALEA: " Because telecommunications industry representatives have expressed a concern that administration's proposal did not specifically address the capacities requirements that would be placed on each carrier, we developed, and this legislation includes, provisions which clearly place the affirmative responsibility on the Attorney General to advise carriers of law enforcement's specific capacity requirements within the first year after enactment of the legislation. These provisions will furnish carriers both with our short-term needs and our longer range capacity requirements such that the required capacity will not be needlessly undersized or oversized."

<h2>Senator Leahy Speaks out Against the CDA</h2>
<p>
Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), a strong and vocal opponent of the Exon "Communications
Decency Act" amd ardent defender of free speech and privacy online, was one of only 5 
Senators to vote against the Telecommunications Reform Bill of which the CDA was part.
<p>
Senator Leahy was also the only member of the Senate to offer a  <a href = "http://www.cdt.org/policy/legislation/s714_leahy_statement.html"> substantative legislative
alternative to the Exon CDA.</a>. Senator Leahy deserves great credit for standing up for
free speech in cyberspace.

        Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy
        on Passage of
        Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act
        Conference Report

        February 1, 1996


          Mr. LEAHY.  Mr. President, I thank my good friend from South
     Carolina, a man whom I have been privileged to serve with in my whole
     Senate career.  He was already a senior Member of the Senate when I
     came here.  I appreciate all the help he has given me.  I appreciate
     the fact that he and the chairman were able to protect the
     Breaux-Leahy amendment on 1-plus dialing parity as part of the
     conference report to permit intraLATA toll dialing parity requirements
     to stand in States that already ordered it by December 19, 1995, and
     in single-LATA States like Vermont.  Preserving this amendment, which
     Senator Breaux and I worked out on this floor, has helped my State.

          There are so many things I like about this bill. For example, the
     conference agreement places restrictions on buyouts between phone
     companies and cable. The conference agreement also includes a very
     strong savings clause to make clear that mergers between companies in
     the media and communications markets are subject to a thorough
     antitrust review.

        Competition, not concentration, is the surest way to assure lower
     prices and greater choices for consumers. So, while there are some
     improvements in this legislation that I support, I will not be voting
     in favor.

          I have expressed my concern on the lack of a stronger Department
     of Justice role in evaluating the anticompetitive effect of a Bell
     Operating Company's entry into the long-distance market, as well as my
     concern that this legislation is placing censorship restrictions on
     the Internet.  As a user of the Internet and as one who communicates
     electronically with constituents and others around the country, I am
     concerned this legislation places restrictions on the Internet that
     will come back to haunt us.

          I know these provisions were done with the best of intentions.
     All of us, 100 Members of the United States Senate, oppose the idea of
     child pornography.  All of us abhor child pornographers and child
     abusers.  I am one person who has prosecuted, convicted, and sent to
     prison child abusers.  We do not have to demonstrate our adherence to
     that principle.  But I am concerned we have not upheld our adherence
     to the First Amendment with the proposed restrictions on the Internet.
      That creates an overwhelming barrier for me.

          I am also concerned that after passing the 1992 Cable Act over a
     Presidential veto, that we are now taking the lid off all cable rates
     in 3 years, whether or not there is competition in cable service.
     Before the 1992 Cable Act was passed, cable rates were rising three
     times faster than inflation rates.  I do not think you can name a
     consumer in this country who did not feel that he or she was being
     gouged.

        But the law worked.  Since passage of the law, consumers have saved
     an estimated $3.5 billion in their monthly bills.  And, as the rates
     have gone down, more people have signed up.  In 1994 alone, nearly 2.5
     million new customers have signed up for cable service.

        I do not want to see a repeat of the skyrocketing cable rates that
     prompted passage of that law.  It is too easy to see what might happen
     if the cable companies are not restrained, either by competition or by
     laws.

          I do not have cable in my home in Vermont.  I live out in the
     country where we get 1  channels. I think sometimes I am blessed by
     that because I actually get to read, which is a good way of obtaining
     the news.  You can make up your own mind.  You can read in detail or
     not, and not be limited by the photographs selected by
     multimillion-dollar news media.

          But I digress.

        With the cable company I subscribe to here, you get these $2 remote
     controls but they charge you $3 a month, or something like that.  They
     can give you antiquated equipment and charge as though you were
     getting good equipment and even make it impossible to watch one show
     and tape another one.  All the things that sound great are not
     available because there is no competition.  We are about to make that
     even worse.  We had some restrictions in the cable bill, but I am
     afraid we are going to let them go before we have the protections
     provided by effective competition.

          I must admit, having said all that, I do not envy the managers of
     this bill.  This is probably the most complex piece of legislation I
     think I have seen in 21 years.  It has probably had more conflicting
     interests that had to be reconciled than I have seen in 21 years.

          I commend the Senators who had the ability to stick it out and
     bring it this far.  Senators still have to determine whether they will
     vote for or it or not, but whether you like or dislike different
     parts, we can all appreciate the hard work and long hours it took.

        The telecommunications legislation that has emerged from the
     conference will have an enormous impact on multi-billion dollar cable,
     phone and broadcast industries and, most importantly, on the American
     consumer. This legislation will affect how much we pay and from whom
     we can obtain cable, TV, phone, fax, and information services. It will
     also, unfortunately, affect what we can say online.

        We have heard a lot about the support for this legislation by the
     Bell phone companies, AT&T and other long-distance phone companies,
     the giant cable companies and other media interests. But while they
     have been arguing over business advantages, who have been advocates
     for American consumers and fundamental American values, like First
     Amendment free speech rights?

        Most of us have no choice who gives us cable TV service or our
     local phone service.  Whether or not the service is good, we're stuck
     with our local phone or cable company. And, if the price is too high,
     our only choice is to drop the service altogether. The goal of this
     telecommunications legislation must be to foster competition, not just
     for the short term, but over the long haul. Competition will give
     consumers lower prices and more choices than simply dropping a
     service.

        I raised a number of questions about the Senate-passed bill, and
     fought for several amendments that in my view would have made the bill
     more consumer-friendly, pro-competitive and constitutional.  I commend
     the conferees for the progress they made in several of these areas,
     which I detail below.

        First, the bill proposed by the Commerce Committee would have
     permitted our local phone monopoly to buy out our local cable monopoly
     so that consumers have even less choice rather than more. Senator
     Thurmond, the distinguished Chairman of the Judiciary Committee's
     Antitrust Subcommittee, and I raised concerns that allowing such
     unlimited buyouts between monopoly phone companies and cable companies
     could result in giant monopolies providing both phone and video
     programming services.

        The conference agreement makes a significant improvement in these
     provisions by limiting buy-outs between cable and phone companies to
     rural areas where fewer than 35,000 people live.  The conference
     agreement also limits a phone company's purchase of cable systems to
     less than ten percent of the households in its service area. This will
     insure that a single large phone company cannot simply buy up all the
     small cable systems serving the small towns in its service area. This
     part of the conference agreement helps fulfill the promise of the bill
     to maximize competition between local phone companies and cable
     companies.

         The conference agreement also contains a very strong "savings
     clause" to make clear that mergers between cable and telephone
     companies, or between independent telephone companies or between any
     companies in the media and communications markets are subject to a
     thorough antitrust review under the normal Hart-Scott-Rodino process.
     Nothing in this conference agreement even impliedly preempts our
     Federal antitrust laws. Mega-mergers between telecommunications
     giants, such as the rumored merger between NYNEX and Bell Atlantic, or
     the gigantic network mergers now underway, raise obvious concerns
     about concentrating control in a few gigantic companies of both the
     content and means of distributing the information and entertainment
     American consumers receive.  Competition, not concentration, is the
     surest way to assure lower prices and greater choices for consumers.
     Rigorous oversight and enforcement by our antitrust agencies is more
     important than ever to insure that such mega-mergers do not harm
     consumers.

        I have been particularly concerned about how well the
     telecommunications legislation protects universal service. Vermont is
     among the most rural States in the country, but those of us who live
     there do not want to be denied access to the advanced
     telecommunications services our urban neighbors enjoy.
     I, therefore, commend the conference report for including the
     Snowe-Rockefeller-Exon-Kerry provision requiring preferential rates
     for telecommunications services provided to schools, libraries and
     hospitals in rural areas, which I supported. This requirement provides
     an important building block to ensure universal access to advanced
     telecommunications services. Students whose families cannot afford
     sophisticated hi-tech services at home will be able to use those
     services at school or at their neighborhood public library. Rural
     hospitals will be able to use advanced technology to provide better
     treatment at lower costs to their patients. This provision assures the
     broadest possible access to advanced telecommunications services.

        I am also pleased to see that the conference report includes the
     addition of a State-appointed consumer advocate to the newly created
     Federal-State Joint Board. This board will have the critical task of
     preserving and expanding universal service, and I agree with the
     conference that a consumer advocate will bring a necessary and
     important perspective to that task.

        The conference agreement also adopts a provision designed to make
     cable equipment cheaper and easier to use for all consumers, who are
     tired of paying rent for cable converter boxes and struggling with
     multiple clickers for the TV, set-top box and their video machines.
     This provision is one that Senator Thurmond and I urged to be included
     as part of the telecommunications legislation in the last Congress.
     Under the conference agreement, the FCC is directed to assure the
     competitive availability to consumers of converter boxes and other
     electronic equipment used to access cable video programming services.

        As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I remain ready to address
     the copyright issues that will arise as a result of this legislation.
     There was no consideration of copyright matters during the debate over
     this legislation and I commend the conferees for not prejudging these
     matters.

        The bill proposed by the Commerce Committee would have
     unnecessarily preempted State efforts to promote the development of
     competition in local phone service. Richard Cowart, the Chairman of
     the Vermont Public Service Board, provided invaluable testimony to the
     Antitrust Subcommittee last year about the detrimental preemption
     provisions in the bill.

        For example, this bill rolled-back State requirements to implement
     "1+" dialing parity for short-haul toll calls. A number of States
     already require dialing parity. Without "1+" dialing parity, consumers
     must dial lengthy access codes to use carriers other than the local
     phone company for in-state toll calls. IntraLATA "1+" dialing parity
     encourages competition in the in-state toll market and helps
     consumers.

         As I noted before, I am pleased that the Breaux-Leahy amendment on
     "1+" dialing parity is part of the conference report.  The report
     permits dialing parity requirements to stand in the States that
     already ordered it by December 19, 1995, and in single-LATA States,
     including Vermont.  The prohibition against "1+" dialing parity for
     intraLATA calls in "non-grandfathered" States expires at a date
     certain three years after enactment.

        In addition, the Commerce Committee bill would have prohibited
     State regulators from using rate-of-return regulation for large phone
     companies.  As Chairman Cowart of the Vermont Public Service Board
     made clear when he testified, this prohibition would have tied the
     hands of <a name = "cda">State regulators trying to adopt different forms of pricing
     regulation to stimulate local phone service competition. The
     conference agreement took a constructive step by dropping the
     prohibition on rate-of-return regulation.

<hr>
<center><b>On the Exon CDA sections</b></center>

        Despite this significant progress, the conference agreement still
     suffers from such serious flaws that I cannot support it.

        First, and foremost, the conference agreement contains
     unconstitutional provisions that would impose far-reaching new federal
     crimes for so-called "indecent" speech. I do not often agree with
     Speaker Gingrich, but I share his view that this legislation violates
     free speech rights.</a>

        Apparently, the conferees also have serious doubts about its
     constitutionality. They added a section to speed up judicial review to
     see if the legislation passes constitutional muster. In my view, this
     legislation will not pass that test.

          You would think the telecommunications conference would have
     their hands full with just the task of changing our
     communications laws to allow new competition among phone
     companies, broadcasters, cable operators and wireless systems
     while also protecting universal service and other appropriate
     consumer protections. Yet, they also decided to add new federal
     crimes, despite the absence of any hearings on these provisions,  or
     any Senate Judiciary Committee members on the conference. I called for
     an in-depth, fast-track study of these issues before we took
     precipitous action in legislation. That study was included in the
     House-passed bill but dropped by the conference, in favor of
     provisions that will ban constitutionally protected speech on the
     Internet.

        I note that the Explanatory Statement accompanying the Conference
     Report refers to a July 24, 1995 hearing, at which I participated,
     before the Senate Judiciary Committee on "online indecency, obscenity
     and child endangerment." This hearing did not address the
     constitutionality of the indecency standard adopted by the Conference
     Report, nor the least restrictive means by which to implement such a
     standard, particularly in an electronic environment like the Internet.
     The hearing referred to in the statement of the Conference Committee
     dealt with stalking, obscenity and indecency with regard to an
     entirely different bill, S. 892.  No witnesses at the hearing defended
     the constitutionality of the indecency standard in the
     telecommunications bill.  Nor did any witness testifying in support of
     S. 892 examine in detail whether the indecency standard as applied to
     online communications complies with the least restrictive means test.
     On the contrary, several witnesses questioned whether any indecency
     standard could be constitutional as applied to online communications.
     Thus, Congress has opted to appear "tough on pornography" without
     examining the constitutional implications of this unprecedented
     restriction on freedom of expression.
        Let us make no mistake about what these provisions in the
     conference agreement will do and how it could affect you.

        o  The bill will make it a felony crime to send a private e-mail
     message with an indecent or filthy word that you hope will annoy
     another person, even if you were responding in kind to an e-mail
     message you received. Who knows when you might annoy another person
     with your e-mail message? To avoid liability under this legislation,
     users of e-mail will have to ban curse words and other expressions
     that might be characterized as offensive  from their online
     vocabulary.

        o  The bill will punish with two-year jail terms any Internet user
     who uses one of the "seven dirty words" in a message to a minor. You
     will risk criminal liability by using a computer to share with a child
     any material containing "indecent" passages. In some areas of the
     country, a copy of Seventeen magazine, could be viewed as indecent
     because it contains information on sex and sexuality. Indeed, this
     magazine is among the 10 most frequently challenged school library
     materials in the country.

        This legislation sweeps more broadly than just regulating e-mail
     messages sent to children.  It will impose felony penalties for using
     an indecent four-letter word, or discussing material deemed to be
     indecent, on electronic bulletin boards or Internet chat areas
     accessible to children.

        Once this bill becomes law, no longer will Internet users be able
     to engage in free-wheeling discussions in news groups and other areas
     on the Internet accessible to minors. They will have to limit all
     language used and topics discussed to that appropriate for
     kindergartners, just in case a minor clicks onto the discussion. No
     literary quotes from racy parts of Catcher in the Rye or Ulysses will
     be allowed. Certainly online discussions of safe sex practices, of
     birth control methods, and of AIDS prevention methods will be suspect.
     Any user who crosses the vague and undefined line of "indecency" will
     be subject to two years in jail and fines.

        Imagine if the Whitney Museum, which currently operates a Web page,
     were dragged into court for permitting representations of
     Michelangelo's David to be looked by kids.

        The conferees call this a "display" prohibition and explain that it
     "applies to content providers who post indecent material for online
     display without taking precautions that shield that material from
     minors."

        What precautions are the conferees talking about?  What precautions
     will Internet users have to take to avoid criminal liability? These
     users, after all, are the ones who provide the "content" read in news
     groups and on electronic bulletin boards. The legislation gives the
     FCC authority to describe the precautions that can be taken to avoid
     criminal liability.

     The legislation gives the FCC authority to describe the precautions
     that can be taken to avoid criminal liability. All Internet users will
     have to wait and look to the FCC for what they must do to protect
     themselves from criminal liability.

        We have already seen the chilling effect that even the prospect of
     this legislation has had on online service providers. A few weeks ago,
     America Online deleted the profile of a Vermonter who communicated
     with fellow breast cancer survivors online. Why? Because, according to
     AOL, she used the "vulgar" word "breast".  AOL later apologized and
     indicated it would permit the use of that word where "appropriate."

        Complaints by German prosecutors prompted another online service
     provider to cut off subscriber access to over 200 Internet news groups
     with the words "sex", "gay" or "erotica" in the name. They censored
     such groups as "clarinet.news.gays," which is an online newspaper
     focused on gay issues, and "gay-net.coming-out", which is a support
     group for gay men and women dealing with going public with their
     sexual orientation.

        What is next? The Washington Post reports today that one software
     program used to protect children from offensive material blocked the
     White House home page because it showed pictures of two couples
     together. Those two couples happened to be the President and Mrs.
     Clinton and the Vice-President and Mrs. Gore. Will federal government
     censors do any better when they dictate blocking technologies?

        The Communications Decency Act is the United States government's
     answer to the problem that China is dealing with by creating an
     "intranet". According to news reports, this censored version of the
     Internet allows Chinese users online access to each other, but an
     official censor controls all outside access to the world-wide
     Internet.

        We already have crimes on the books that apply to the Internet, by
     banning obscenity, child pornography, and threats from being
     distributed over computers. In fact, just before Christmas, the
     President signed a new law we passed last year sharply increasing
     penalties for child pornography and sexual exploitation crimes.

        Unlike these current laws, which do not regulate constitutionally
     protected speech, this legislation would censor indecent speech. While
     the proponents of the proposals claim that they do not "ban" indecency
     -- only prohibit making it available to minors -- the practical result
     of such a restriction on the Internet is the criminalization of all
     indecent speech.

          Because indecency means very different things to different
     people, an unimaginable amount of valuable political, artistic,
     scientific and other speech will disappear in this new medium.
     What about, for example, the university health service that posts
     information online about birth control and protections against
     the spread of AIDS?  With many students in college under 18, this
     information would likely disappear under threat of prosecution.
     In bookstores and on library shelves the protection of indecent
     speech is clear, and the courts are unwavering. Altering the
     protections of the First Amendment for online communications could
     cripple this new mode of communication.
        The Internet is a great new communications medium. We should not
     underestimate the effect that the heavy-hand of government regulation
     will have on its future growth both here and abroad. With the passage
     of this bill the U.S. Government is paving the way for the censorship
     of Internet speech. Apparently, China already censors weather
     predictions from foreigners. What do we think the Iranian government
     will make illegal? What could Libya ban and criminalize?

        Also, as I alluded earlier, I continue to have grave concerns about
     letting the Bell Operating Companies, with their monopoly control over
     the phone wires going into our homes, enter the long-distance market
     even when the Department of Justice finds an anticompetitive impact. I
     supported efforts to amend the bill and give the Justice Department
     the authority to review the Bell Companies' long-distance entry in
     advance.  These efforts were unsuccessful.

        The conference report requires the FCC to consult with the Justice
     Department and "give substantial weight" to the Justice Department's
     opinion, in determining whether to permit entry of a Bell company into
     long-distance service. Although this provision strengthens the
     Senate-passed bill, it does not go far enough.  It fails to achieve
     the balance proposed by the Commerce Committee in 1994. In the end,
     the FCC is the final decision maker and can decide to disregard the
     Justice Department's evaluation of the anticompetitive effect of
     letting the Bell Companies offer long-distance service.

        The conference agreement would permit a Bell Company to offer long
     distance service in its own region, upon approval by the FCC and after
     satisfying an "in-region" checklist. This checklist could be satisfied
     by the presence of a competitor with its own networking facilities.
     Despite recognition by the conferees that building local telephone
     network facilities will require a significant investment in time and
     money, the bill allows only 10 months after enactment for
     facilities-based competitors to get established and apply for
     interconnection and access to the Bell Company's network. Absent a
     facilities-based competitor in those 10 months, I fear that the
     language of this bill could be interpreted broadly to allow the Bell
     Operating Company to seek approval to enter long-distance service, and
     authorize the FCC to grant that approval, even without any actual
     competition in local phone service. The short time-frame provided in
     the bill to establish a facilities-based competitor, compounded by the
     lack of a dispositive Justice Department role in the approval process,
     could provide the incumbent Bell Company with the ability to use its
     stranglehold monopoly on local service to leverage its new
     long-distance service, to the detriment of consumers. Regulators will
     have to be vigilant to this potential consequence.

        As I noted, the conference agreement takes the lid off all cable
     rates in three years, whether or not there is any competition in cable
     service.
        We passed the 1992 Cable Act over a Presidential veto because
     consumers were being gouged by cable company monopolists.  Cable rates
     were rising three times faster than the inflation rate.  Consumers
     demanded action to stop the rising cable rates. This law worked. Since
     passage of that law, consumers have saved an estimated $3.5 billion in
     their monthly rates.  As rates have gone down, more people have signed
     up.
        Congress has already responded once to complaints of cable
     subscribers in the 1992 Cable Act.  I, for one, do not want to see a
     repeat of the sky-rocketing cable rates that prompted passage of that
     law. The conferees must be predicting that, in three years, cable
     companies will face plenty of competition from satellite systems and
     phone companies offering video services. But if their prediction is
     accurate, and the cable companies faced effective competition, they
     would be deregulated under the 1992 Cable Act anyway.  This is a
     precipitous action to sunset a law that worked to reduce cable rates
     on the hope that effective competition will grow over the next three
     years.

        Finally, the conference report requires the FCC to preempt State or
     local rules that may have the effect of barring any entity from
     providing telecommunications services. Although the report says this
     is not supposed to affect local management of public rights-of-way or
     local safeguards for the rights of consumers, in Vermont, citizens are
     rightly concerned that rules designed to protect our environment and
     health may be preempted by bureaucrats at the FCC who are focused on
     helping entrants in the telecommunications business.

        I recognize the need for an over-haul of our communications laws.
     We have not kept up with the dramatic technological changes that are
     fueling the Information Age. But I cannot support this bill, which
     threatens fundamental constitutional rights of free speech over the
     Internet and provides insufficient consumer protection from
     monopolistic pricing for cable and telephone service.

<p>
<p>
The United States Senate last week approved sweeping Internet censorship legislation which dramatically restricts the free flow of information in interactive media, and fails to even provide effective protection for children from access to inappropriate information.  The Center for Democracy and Technology strongly opposes the Exon/Coats Communications Decency Act for the following reasons:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Unconstitutional ban on "indecent" material in most parts of the internet:</b>  The Act imposes criminal penalties of $100,000 fines or up to two years in prison on anyone who "knowingly ... makes or makes available any indecent communications ... to any person under 18 years of age."  This restriction on indecency (a legal term which includes the "seven dirty words" as well as any sexually-explicit material) amounts to a total ban on all "indecent" information in public areas of the Internet, since all users of the Internet know that public areas are accessible to minors.  The United States Supreme Court has held over and over again that indecent material is protected by the First Amendment and may only be regulated with narrowly tailored means that leave adults free to communicate.  Senator Exon's bill has failed to identify Constitutionally-appropriate means of regulation.  As Senator Leahy pointed out during the Senate debate,  the Exon bill would force everyone on the Internet to behave as if there were in "Sunday school."
<p>
<li><b>Second-class free speech rights for all interactive media: </b> The Exon/Coats amendment diminishes the First Amendment rights of those who use interactive media as opposed to those who communicate through print.  The indecency ban in Exon/Coats creates the paradoxical result that speech which would be fully-protected in books, magazines, newspapers, or other print-based publications, would be subject to criminal sanction if made available over the Internet. In other words, what is legal in all of the nation's bookstores would become illegal in cyberspace.  
<p>
<li><b>Criminalization of "annoying" messages: </b> Annoying someone using harsh (but not obscene) language over interactive media would become a crime, also punishable by $100,000 fines and two year jail terms.  Federal and many state laws already criminalize harassment, no matter what the medium, but prohibiting mere annoyance is clearly unconstitutional and a wasteful abuse of federal power.
<p>
<li><b>Federal communications commission jurisdiction over content and technical standards on the internet: </b> Enforcement of the Exon/Coats bill will require extensive an ongoing FCC proceedings to determine what exactly constitutes "indecency" in various interactive media, and how the "safe harbor" defenses in the bill will function.  Such regulation will mean that the FCC intrude on the development of all current and future Internet standards for services such as the World Wide Web, electronic mail, and Usenet newsgroups.  CDT believes that such an FCC role will lead to unnecessary confusion and delay in the growth of the Internet, as well as cast a continual chill over all speech on the Internet and other interactive media.
<p>
<li><b>Provisions designed to protect online service providers from liability are ineffective:</b> The "defenses" to prosecution that are intended to protect online services and Internet access providers from liability will create significant risk of criminal liability for all services that provide access to the Internet.  Though Senator Exon may originally promised to exempt these providers from liability, his last-minute compromise with Senator Coats, and failure to understand the basic operation of Internet services, left all  Internet access providers at risk of criminal liability for providing access to Usenet newsgroups and other public information services.
<p>
<li><b>"good faith defense" for service providers may encourage violations of user privacy: </b> Section (f)(4) of Act insulates online service providers from any contractual liability that may arise from their efforts to restrict minors' access to indecent material.  Because of the vaguaries of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act regarding service provider access to subscriber email for "system maintenance purposes," this provision may imunize online service providers who read private messages of their users in circumstances where the provider is acting within the bounds of the Exon/Coats bill.
<p>
<li><b>Undue burden on individual users, content providers, and small system operators: </b> Although Senator Exon claims that his bill is only an extension of the dial-a-porn law, it is actually far broader.  The dial-a-porn law applied only to commercial providers of 900 number services, not every telephone customer in the country.  Given the fact that every Internet user is both a publisher and a receiver of information, Exon's new law, if enacted, would create new regulations on the speech of all those who use interactive media.
</ul>
<p>
In simple terms, the Communications Decency Act would enshrine in statute a sharp distinction between the print medium and new interactive media.  For example, though an individual is allowed to go into a bookstore and buy a sexually-explicit magazine or a "lewd" work of art, one would not be able to access the identical information over the Internet.  Both the interactive media and the print media are arenas in which individuals and organizations exercise core First Amendment free speech rights.  Before Congress elects to diminish the First Amendment protections available in this new medium, we believe that careful, public consideration is required.
<p>
<b>A.	Unconstitutional Restrictions On Indecent Speech Online:  Banning The "Seven Dirty Words" On The Net.</b>
<p>
	If this new proposal became law, the level of discourse on the Internet as a whole would have to be reduced to that which is considered appropriate for children.  A newly added section (e) effectively makes it illegal to use any of the "seven dirty word" in public forums on the Internet.  This new subsection makes in a crime to "knowingly" make and transmit an indecent message to anyone under 18 years old.  This provision covers both private messages between two individuals and public postings to newsgroups that may well reach hundreds of thousands of people around the world.  Though the drafters may want to limit this crime to situations where material is provided directly to minors, that is simply impossible on the net.  Anyone who participates in public discussion groups knows that there may well be kids reading the group as well.  Thus, they would be violating the law simply by posting a hotly-worded message.
<p>
Examples of Prohibited items under the new subsection (e)
<ul><li>Rap music lyrics (both the text and the sound files)
<li>Lady Chatterly's Lover
<li>Public declaration that you're "pissed off" or that someone is a "shit."
<li>Calvin Klein advertisements (the ones with naked bodies)
</ul>
<p>
	The constitutional flaw in this section lies in the critical distinction between "obscenity," that which is truly hard-core pornography, and "indecency," sexually-explicit material which may be offensive to some or may be considered by some to be inappropriate for children, but which is protected by the First Amendment.  Under the First Amendment, Congress has broad power to ban obscenity, but can only regulate indecency in very narrow circumstances, such as in the broadcast media where there is a captive audience.  Pacifica Foundation v. FCC (1978) .  Even in these narrow circumstances, such regulation may be the "least intrusive means" for accomplishing the government's goal of protecting children.  Sable Communications v. FCC.  Given the existence of software and hardware that enable parents to block children's access to indecent material the regulation here does not constitute the "least restrictive means" requirement set out by the Supreme Court.  
<p>
	CDT believes that the Act as drafted would not survive a First Amendment challenge under the law of Sable because the Senate has altogether failed to investigate less restrictive alternatives to meeting its goal of protecting children.  The Senate has held no hearings and made no legislative findings which support its decision.  During the debate on the Senate floor, both Senator Leahy and Senator Feingold offered evidence that there are less restrictive alternatives available.  Neither Senator Exon, Senator Coats, no any other Senator rebutted or responded to these assertions.  In light of the overwhelming evidence that users and parents can exercise control over what they and their children receive over the Internet, a court reviewing the constitutionality of the bill, would, we believe, be forced to return the matter to Congress for further consideration.
<p>
	Furthermore, the government may not regulation indecent material in a way that would deny adults access to such material.  Butler v. Michigan (1957).  This is precisely the result that is produced by this new statutory proposal.  Such as result would be both unwise and unconstitutional.  The highly restrictive treatment proposed here for interactive media creates a situation in the future whereby material that is legally available to people of all ages in bookshops and libraries will be banned from the Internet.  During the Senate debate, Senator Feingold also pointed out that there are many kinds valuable information on the Internet that might be considered indecent under FCC definitions, such as AIDS education information, various works of art, etc.
<p>
<p>
<b>B.	Intrusion Of The Federal Communications Commission On Content And Standards In Interactive Media</b>
<p>
	There are "defenses to prosecution" under this statute which are designed to limit the liability of service providers and, possibly, users and content creators.  (See subsection (f))  To avoid being prosecuted under this statute an entity can take "good faith steps" to restrict access to the possibly infringing communications and then hope that if charged with violating the Act, that the court believes you took sufficient steps.  A more prudent person, or a corporation with money and reputation at risk, would more likely wait to see what the FCC says are sufficient steps to restrict access and follow those regulations.  Until the FCC acts, the defenses applicable to the dial-a-porn law are available, but it is not clear how they would apply to interactive media.
<p>
If this provision were to become law, an FCC rulemaking will be required to decide two issues:
<p>
1) what is indecent in interactive media?  
<p>
    This could include the "seven dirty words", frontal nudity, sound files with heavy breathing, or many other examples. However, granting the Federal Communications Commission the authority to answer to this question would bring the Internet under a similar content regime as broadcast television and radio. 
<p>
2) what steps must be taken to restrict access to indecent material?
<p>
     The FCC will also have to decide what techniques must be used to restrict access sufficiently to enable users and providers to avoid criminal liability. FCC intrusion in the rapidly evolving interactive media market promises to delay the development of new technologies, squelch the entrepreneurial spirit which has helped the Internet to grow, and chill the speech of all users and content creators.  The FCC took 8 years to get blocking rules settled just for 900# services, and that was one relatively simple technology.  Giving the FCC authority to set child-access standards for every piece of the Net, and all new Net services that develop is a disaster for the medium and will have a sweeping chilling effect on both the technology and free expression online.
<p>
	As Senator Leahy noted during debate on the bill, "the Internet has become the tremendous success it is because it did not have Big Brother, the Federal Government, trying to micromanage what it does and trying to tell users what it could do.  If the Government had been in charge of figuring out how to expand the Internet or make it more available and so on, I guarantee it would not be one-tenth the success it is today." (Cong. Rec. 8344)
<p>
<p>
<b>C.	A New Crime Of Online Annoyance</b>
<p>
Senator Exon proposes criminal sanctions for anyone who uses "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" communications "with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person."  Federal and state laws already punish criminal harassment, regardless of the medium used  to perpetrate the crime.  (See 18 USC 875(c)).  CDT believes that additional laws in this area are simply unnecessary.  Moreover, the Department has Justice has said that it has adequate prosecutorial powers in this new environment. (See DoJ letter June 14, 1995).
<p>
<p>
<b>D.	Limitations On Service Provider Liability Are Weak And Threaten To Radically Reduce The Decentralized Nature Of The Internet</b>
<p>
	Some provisions of the Exon/Coats bill attempt to limit the liability of service providers where they act only as passive transmitters of content.  However, these provisions have been significantly weakened as a result of pressure from anti-pornography groups, and are subject to interpretation which creates great risk for both users and service providers.  Anti-pornography groups have been pressing to hold online providers responsible for all of the information accessible to minors on the Internet.  The earlier version of the Exon bill excused from criminal liability anyone who had no editorial control over the content of the message.  However, the bill passed by the Senate removed the "editorial control" defense.  Instead, service providers could limit their liability only if they "ha[ve] no control" over the service, or if they take steps to restrict access for minors.  The degree of nature or degree of control which could leave a provider open to liability is, however, not specified.  CDT believes that these weakened "defenses" leave access providers, and thus Internet users, in a state of great uncertainty as to their responsibility under this bill.  
<p>
	One of the major criticisms of the original legislation introduced by Senator Exon in February 1995 was that it placed criminal liability on online service providers and Internet access providers for any content that traveled across their networks.  In response to these criticisms, Senator Exon altered his bill to assure that service providers would not be held responsible for content on their network unless they exercised editorial control.  However, in the final days before Senate action on the bill, Senator Exon changed the provisions again at the request of Senator Coats.  Now, the presumption of liability has been reversed and a service provider would have to show that it has no control over the service which carried indecent content to a particular minor.
<p>
 o<b> THE END OF USENET NEWSGROUPS?</b>
<p>
	The major uncertainty of the defenses centers on what it means for a service provider to have control over indecent or obscene content.  The uncertainty of this defense is revealed in an analysis of an Internet access providers relationship and potential criminal liability for providing access to Internet newsgroups such as Usenet.  Most Internet service providers provide access to Usenet, and, generally make choices about which newsgroups they carry.  Some carry all newsgroups, others carry only some groups.  The architecture of the Internet newsgroup system is such that a particular Internet access provide can chose to exclude the "alt.sex" newsgroups, or not.  Does this ability to exercise control mean that the service provider is criminally liable under the statute?  Or, does a carrier have to actually exercise control over the content of individual messages?  These definitional questions are legal fine points, but create substantial uncertainty over the meaning of the Act and are likely to lead to litigation and instability in the Internet environment.  Until these issues are resolved, there will likely be a substantial chilling effect on all speech on such services. 
<p>
	The bill and associated legislative history leave some doubt as to the meaning of control, since it is never explicitly defined.  Debate on the Senate floor, which is often used by courts to divine the legislative intent of the drafters where a statute is unclear, gives seemingly contradictory signals on the question of service provider liability for services such as Usenet newsgroups.  One the one hand Senator Exon says in the Congressional Record of the debate that an online provider merely providing access, navigational tools and incidental services "is not aware of the contents of the  communications and should not be responsible" for violation of the obscenity, indecency or harassment crimes in the Act.  (Cong. Rec., S8345).  On the other hand, Senator Coats, the co-sponsor of the bill, says that the Act "does not create a defense for someone who has some level of control over the material of the provision of the material."  (Cong. Rec. S8345).  Senator Exon also says in the course of this "colloquy" with Senator Coats that those "engaging in pornography and indecency should install 'electronic bouncers' at their electronic doors" to keep minors out. (Id.)
<p>
	CDT believes that defenses to prosecution for online service providers are critical in the context of this legislation, but is concerned that the defenses no longer serve the function for which they were originally designed.  As written in the Senate-passed bill, the defenses appear to require Internet service providers to interfere with the content of messages on their networks if they have any ability to do so.  
<p>
o <b>CREATION OF NEW GATEKEEPERS</b>
<p>
	Forcing online services providers to exercise control as the new Exon/Coats bill seems to require would spell the end of the open, decentralized communications environment which has characterized the Internet until now.  As we have argued elsewhere, users and parents have a great degree of control over what they and their children receive in interactive media.  Federal policy should encourage the development of this user control potential, rather than return to the centralized control regulatory models which characterized the mass media.  As an open, decentralized medium, the Internet promotes the free flow of information and serves as a valuable political and cultural forum. If we rely on user control technology we can protect children without involving federal regulators in the censorship of constitutionally-protected speech.
<p>
<p>
<b>E.	Unfair Treatment Of Individual Users, Educational Institutions And Other Non-Commercial Services: Pre-Emption Against Restrictive State Laws Only For Commercial Services</b>
<p>
	If enacted, this proposal would protect commercial service providers from additional censorship by state legislatures, but leave all non-commercial users, including libraries, schools, community groups, and individuals subject to additional regulation and censorship under state law.  The proposal pre-empts state statutes that might censor commercial services beyond the scope of federal law, but leaves all other net users and groups exposed to any censorship that states may choose to enact.  We find no valid public policy argument which would accord greater protection to commercial speech than is granted to non-commercial users of the net.
<p>
<p>
<b>Conclusion: Failure To Take Full Advantage Of User And Parental Control Features Inherent In Interactive Media</b>
<p>
	Legislating about new interactive media requires a careful understanding of the unique attributes of this new medium.  First and foremost, interactive media enable users (including parents) to exercise choice over the information that they and their children have access to.  In sharp contrast to older media, government content regulation is simply not necessary in order to shield children from possibly inappropriate information.  Any legislative action in this are must identify ways to promote greater parental and user control.  As drafted, the proposal before us suggests possible FCC rulemaking on this issue, but is no guaranty that the Commission would take this course.  Instead of just passing this critical question off to a regulatory body, Congress must identify both legal and voluntary means to encourage the development of more and more flexible and accessible user control techniques.
<p>
	Interactive media such as the Internet, commercial online services, and interactive television networks, are, by nature, distinctly different from traditional broadcast and television mass media.  Interactive media does not suffer from a scarcity of capacity, nor does it assault an audiance of captive viewers. Most importantly, interactive media offers users tremendous control over the content that they and their children receive.  The Exon/Coats proposal completely fails to account for these unique aspects of interactive media. As House of Representatives begins to consider this and other proposals to regulate content on the Internet, CDT will continue to fight the Exon/Coats proposal, and will work to find alternative prolicy solutions which preserve the First Amendment an the free flow of information in cyberspace.

<center><h3>LEAHY STATEMENT ON INTRODUCTION OF S. 714</h3></center>
<p>
<p>
<b>STATEMENT OF SENATOR LEAHY</b>
On Introduction of The Child Protection, User Empowerment, and Free Expression In Interactive Media Study Bill
<p>
April 7, 1995
<p>
Mr. President: I rise today to introduce a bill calling for a study by the Department of Justice, in consultation with the U.S. Department of Commerce on how we can empower parents and users of interactive telecommunications systems, such as the Internet, to control the material transmitted to them over those systems. We must find ways to do this that do not invite invasions of privacy, lead to censorship of private online communications, and undercut important constitutional protections.
<p>
Before legislating to impose government regulation on the content of communications in this enormously complex area, I feel we need more information from law enforcement and telecommunications experts. My bill calls for just such a fast-track study of this issue.
<p>
There is no question that we are not living through a revolution in telecommunications with cheaper, easier to use and faster ways to communicate electronically with people within our own homes and communities, and around the globe.
<p>
A byproduct of this technical revolution is that supervising our children takes on a new dimension of responsibility. Very young children are so adept with computers that they can sit at a keypad in front of a computer screen at home or at school and connect to the outside world through the Internet or some other on-line service. Many of us are, thus, justifiably concerned about the accessibility of obscene and indecent materials on-line and the ability of parents to monitor and control the materials to which their children are exposed. But government regulation of the content of all computer and telephone communications, even private communications, in violation of the First Amendment is not the answer -- it is merely a knee-jerk response.
<p>
Heavy-handed efforts by government to regulate obscenity on interactive information services will only stifle the free flow of information, discourage the robust development of new information services, and make users avoid using the system.
<p>
The problem of policing the Internet is complex and involves many important issues. We need to protect copyrighted materials from illegal copying. We need to protect privacy. And we need to help parents protect their children. Penalties imposed after the harm is done is not enough. We need to find technical means from stopping the harm done before it happens.
<p>
My bill calls for a study to address the legal and technical issues for empowering users to control the information they receive over electronic interactive services. Instead of rushing to regulate the content of information services, we should encourage the development of technology that gives parents and other consumers the ability to control the information that can be access over a modem.
<p>
Empowering parents to manage what their kids access over the Internet with technology under their control is far preferable to some of the bills pending in Congress that would criminalize users or deputize information service providers as smut police.
<p>
Let's see what this study reveals before we start legislating in ways that could severely damage electronic communications systems, sweep away important constitutional rights, and undercut law enforcement at the same time.
<p>
I ask unanimous consent, to have printed in the record at this pint, the "Child Protection, User Empowerment, and Free Expression in Interactive Media Study" bill.

<LI><H2>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers selects Isis&#174;</H2>
Triton Technology has delivered another Isis system to the 
<A HREF="http://www.orl.usace.army.mil/"><B>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</B></A>.
Current interfaces include the 
<A HREF="http://www.reson.com/"><B>Reson</B></A> SeaBat 9001 and 9002 systems 
as well as the Odom Echoscan, which take advantage of the new Isis Multibeam Digital 
Interface Module developed to log and display co-located bathymetry and imagery.
 
Following six at-sea tests with the SeaBat 9001, Triton delivered Isis with the Multibeam interface to  
both the Detroit and Louisville Districts of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for shallow water survey 
operations. Both systems were delivered in conjunction with the Reson SeaBat 9001.  Richard Lear, 
General Manager of Reson UK said, Isis complements the SeaBat by its ability to display and combine 
both the bathymetry and imagery from the profiler.  Isis can overlay a backscatter intensity value for 
each of the 60 beams or the actual sidescan information on top of the 3-D bathymetry display.
<p>
<LI><H2>Isis selected as topside for 
<A HREF="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/noaa.html"><B>NOAA</B></A>'s Focused Multibeam Sidescan Systems</H2>
NOAA recently awarded a contract  to Klein Associates for a high-speed, high-resolution, focused 
multibeam side scan sonar. Tritons Isis was selected as the topside processor for the system. NOAA 
expects to order up to eleven systems over five years. The first delivery is scheduled for June 96.  
Isis was selected for its ability to acquire, digitize, process, display in  real-time, and store  high-
resolution imagery. Isis leads the industry with  state-of-the-art features that include: virtual resolution; Windows 95 and NT operating systems; and high-speed hardware that allows data to be played back as fast as the eye can see.   
Other outstanding Isis features include: signal/pixel processing with selectable downsampling methods to 
fit the application; image analysis with logging to disk; and user interface with comprehensive On-Line 
Help.
<p>
<LI><H2>New Isis Modules and Features</H2>
<UL>
<LI><H3>TriPort data converter</H3>
TriPort Ver.1.0, was released in January, 1995, enabling Isis and Q-MIPS Users to convert imagery 
stored as .DAT files to a format compatible with most popular GIS and word processing packages.  
TriPort runs under Windows 3.1, 95 and NT. 
<p>
<LI><H3>Digital SLS Interfaces</H3>
Triton has added digital interfaces for several more digital sidescan systems.  Current digital interfaces 
include the Klein System-2000, EG&G DF-1000 and the Datasonics SIS-1000 systems.  Other digital 
interfaces require only that a digital server and hardware interface be developed. Contact the Sales 
department for pricing information. 
<p>
<LI><H3>Auto Freespan Detection</H3>
A new module for automatically detecting and logging pipeline freespans has been developed and 
implemented in Isis for offshore pipeline survey operations.  The new module was developed by Triton 
and tested by Stolt Comex Seaway in Haugesund, Norway. Using imagery from a sidescan sonar, the new 
module will display and log a freespans start and stop location. The new package is also capable of 
tracking up to four pipelines simultaneously in both real- and post-time as well as displaying the span 
information and a maximum span length and height detected.  
<p>
<LI><H3>Graph</H3>
Triton has added the new graphing capability to Isis as standard (provided free to Users with current 
EMA or warranty). The graph feature allows the User to graph all attitude, navigation, CTD and most any 
other sensor data as a function of time. 
 
The advantage of the graph feature is the ability to monitor data quality in real-time and to aid in the 
calibration of various sensors.  The User controls the time intervals for the display windows and Isis 
displays an average value for each display (e.g. trim, list, etc.). 
<p> 
<LI><H3>32-bit version of Isis</H3>
Triton has just released a 32-bit version of Isis capable of running under both Windows 95 and NT.  The 
32-bit upgrade was included with the latest 16-bit upgrade version that all Isis Users under EMA received 
in early December. 
Users interested in upgrading to 32-bit Isis are required to purchase a copy of either Windows 95 or NT.  
Triton currently recommends Windows 95 because of the better User interface and 2K x 2K virtual 
resolution. 
<p>
<LI><H3>Interface to Seatex MRU</H3>
For Isis users incorporating a motion reference unit in their system, Triton has developed a two-way 
interface to the Seatex range of MRU's.  The new interface requires only that a serial connection be made 
between Isis and the MRU and Isis will automatically configure itself to extract only the required attitude 
information. Contact Clark Friesen at Seatex, Inc. at (206) 836-8021.

<H2>Technical Trends at Triton Technology, Inc.</H2>

Happy New Year! 
In keeping with the new year, Triton's technical manuals are turning over a new leaf and  taking on a 
cleaner look. As a taste of things to come,   Triton's newest manuals now feature: 
<UL>
<LI>More graphics 
<LI>Chapter-driven tables of contents 
<LI>Chapter-driven indexes 
<LI>The new format will make it easier and faster for you to find help in the manuals. 
<LI>Soon you will be able to access more of our documentation on-line.  
</UL>    
We are experimenting with a product called FrameViewer, which lets you browse our 
manuals on-line. With it you can read and print information that interests you. 
One of the main benefits of the on-line version of the new manuals is that when you click on a table of 
contents or index entry, the on-line system takes you directly to the subject in the manual. We hope this 
on-line approach will cut down on the time it takes you to find the information you need most. 
New users' manuals for Isis and Vista for Windows 95 and NT are now available.  
 
For those of you who still prefer technical information from traditional hardcopy, Triton will continue to 
offer it to you that way. Extra manuals in the form of hardcopy are available at $25/copy. 

<br>
<H2>Isis Demonstrations</H2>

<A HREF="http://www.connix.com/~coastalo/"><B>Coastal Oceanographics</B></A> and the US Army Corps of Engineers Topographic Engineering Center (TEC)

Oceanology International 96 
We will be exhibiting Isis, VISTA, and all of the other modules for Isis at the Oceanology International 
96 conference being held in Brighton, England during the week of 4-8 March, 1996.  The Isis will be 
displayed on the joint exhibit of EIVA A/S - Scantron Ltd., our Scandinavian and UK representatives. 
Please stop by Triton's booth #303 to chat or to get a personal demonstration of Isis and our other 
product.
<br>				 
<H2>Isis F.A.Q.'s</H2>
<DL>
<DT>Q.  How can an Isis User tell if the sonar is triggering?
<DT>A.  There is an LED light located on the front of the Signal Interface Unit (SIU-4) that should be blinking 
in time with the received trigger.
<p>
<DT>Q.  How can I troubleshoot the cause of no imagery displayed in Isis after a recording session has been 
initiated? 
<DT>A.  Open a voltage window under the main menu item WINDOW, VOLTAGE, SIGNAL.  If there is a 
signal coming across, imagery will be generated.  Make sure that the Threshold setting is appropriate for 
the signal that is being received.  If the signal is low, adjust the THRESHOLD slide bar so that imagery  
is visible. 
If you do not see a signal in the Isis voltage window, make sure that the SIU4 unit has a blinking light.  If 
so, check the 5BNC connectors coming from the sonar into the SIU4 and the DB-37 connector that plugs 
into the back of Isis. 
Restart Isis after all connections have been checked.  If recording is still unsuccessful, hook up an 
oscilloscope to the sonar's outputs to check the signal.  
If the signal from the sonar is correct, hook the scope to the output channels of the SIU4 to verify that 
signals are being output. 
<p> 
<DT>Q.  What are the most common causes of failure of the Magneto-Optical drives? 
<DT>A.  Overheating and dirt.  To maintain the proper temperature inside the Isis chassis, the User should 
clean the filters located on the front and back of Isis.  Keeping these filters clean allows for proper air 
circulation.  M-O drives put out a great amount of heat and require clean filters to maintain the needed air 
flow. 
<p> 
<DT>Q.  What should be done if an optical drive in Isis suddenly stops working? 
<DT>A.  Shut down Isis and let it cool.  Allow enough time so the M-O drive cools down completely.  Check 
and clean your air filters while Isis is off.  Restart the computer and, while it is booting, look at the M-O 
drive.  A light on the far left should blink 5 to 7 times (depending on the operating system).  If the light 
on the right goes on, and stays on, your drive needs to be returned for repair. 
<p>
<DT>Q.  Before I go out on my  survey, I need to estimate the amount of disk space (or magneto-optical space) 
I should reserve for my data in Isis or Q-MIPS. How do I do that? 
<DT>A.  The key variable to measure is the number of bytes per ping that will be used during your survey. 
Bytes per ping depend on the following factors: 
<UL>
<LI>How many samples per channel are specified to be stored for each ping
<LI>Whether each pixel captured by a ping will represent 16 bits or 8 bits of data 
<LI>Whether you will be saving both raw and corrected imagery, or just one or the other (Q-MIPS only) 
<LI>How many channels will be operating during the data survey 
<LI>The operational length of time of your data survey 
</UL>
Refer to page B-2 and the equations on page B-3 of the Isis User's Manual for a comprehensive 
discussion on this issue. 
<p>
<DT>Q.  When do you plan to release the Windows version of VISTA Mosaic? 
<DT>A.  An advance version of Vista for Windows 95 and NT will be released to selected Users and Triton 
Distributors and Reps  in January 1996. 
<p>
The Beta program for VISTA for Windows was a success over the last year and we expect to iron out any 
remaining issues over the next month.  The first release of the program will be February 1, 1996.   
Please contact the sales department to get more information or to get a preliminary copy of VISTA.

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">SUMMARY
</FONT></B>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Ethanol is a grain-derived alcohol fuel
that provides significant net positive economic and environmental
benefits to the American economy and the economies of the states
where it is produced.  The existence and operation of the American
ethanol industry will provide a <U><I>net saving to the Federal
Treasury and taxpayers of almost  $4 billion</I></U> over the
next seven years. In addition to the fiscal impacts, the economic
contribution of the ethanol industry includes:
</FONT>
<P>
<ul>
<li><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  Creation of almost $60 billion (1996
$) of final demand for the entire economy.
</FONT>
<li><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  Generation of $12.5 billion in additional
household income over the next seven years.
</FONT>
<li><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  The creation of over 55,500 jobs annually
throughout the entire economy.
</FONT>
<li><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  The generation of $15.6 billion of
net farm income. 
</FONT></ul>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Previous analyses of the ethanol industry
have focused on the costs to the Federal Treasury of the partial
exemption for alcohol fuels from the excise tax on motor fuels.
 Few have examined the macroeconomic contribution made by the
ethanol industry.  One such study was conducted in September 1995
by the General Accounting Office.  This  analysis concluded that
elimination of the ethanol tax exemption would result in net losses
to the U.S. Treasury over the five year period 1996-2000 because
increases in farm program payments would outweigh the $2.5 billion
increase in gasoline tax revenues.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">GAO recognized that ethanol production
would fall substantially if the excise tax exemption were removed
and that this would have a negative impact on grain prices and
farm income.  The new farm bill which was signed into law in April
1996 virtually eliminates the impact of the excise tax on government
outlays to farmers since payments are now de-linked from production.
 However, since farm income will now be increasingly tied to returns
from the marketplace, the 1996 Farm Bill actually increases the
importance of the ethanol industry since ethanol is a large and
growing element of grain demand.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">However, that is only part of the story.
 GAO failed to extend their analysis past outlays for commodity
programs to the broader implications of the ethanol industry for
aggregate output, job creation, household and business income,
and tax revenues.  This study focuses on these benefits.
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">BACKGROUND</FONT></B>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"> Ethanol is an alcohol fuel which can
be  produced from almost any raw material containing sugar or
carbohydrates. Most ethanol produced in the United States is made
from grain, with corn the most prevalent feed stock.  About 60
percent of the ethanol produced from corn is made in wet milling
plants that also produce sweeteners, starches, and corn oil. 
The remaining 40 percent is produced by corn dry milling plants
that also make distillers grains (a medium protein animal feed
supplement), corn meal and other food ingredients. 
</FONT>
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="aus1.GIF" ></center>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">In 1995 nearly 1.4 billion gallons of
ethanol were produced from 553 million bushels of corn.  As shown
in Figure 1, ethanol production in the United States has increased
dramatically over the last decade and a half. This expansion occurred
largely as a result of incentives provided by federal and state
governments which were intended to reduce dependence on imported
oil and create new markets for domestically grown grain.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Under current law alcohol blends, typically
90 percent gasoline and 10 percent ethanol, are exempted from
5.4 cents of the 18.4 cents per gallon federal excise tax on gasoline.
 ETBE, an oxygenate made from ethanol is also eligible for the
 partial exemption from the federal excise tax on motor fuels,
while MTBE, which is made from methanol and usually produced from
petroleum products, is not. 
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">It is important to note that the
excise tax exemption is claimed by gasoline refiners and blenders
who use ethanol and ETBE and</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">
<I>not the producers of ethanol or farmers who grow the grain
used to make ethanol.
</I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The impact of the excise tax exemption
on ethanol producers is one of simple economics.  At existing
technology and current scales of production, ethanol made from
grain is more expensive to produce than is MTBE from methanol.
 Ethanol competes with gasoline and gasoline blending agents including
non-renewable oxygenates such as MTBE.  The prices of gasoline
and blending agents have been closely tied to the price of crude
oil on world markets. The largest element of variability in the
cost of producing ethanol is the price of corn and the value of
the by-product credits associated with wet and dry corn milling,
which are based on the values of the other products produced along
with ethanol. 
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Ethanol is competitive with the excise
tax exemption.  Without the exemption, refiners and blenders would
use alternative oxygenates that are less expensive in part because
of domestic and foreign subsidies, and the market for ethanol
would collapse.   In the absence of the exemption, blenders and
some refiners will shift to lower-cost MTBE as their oxygenate
of choice.  As a result, total corn demand over the next seven
years period would be reduced by nearly 3.4 billion bushels.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The solid line in Figure 2 depicts the
projected path of ethanol demand based on current market conditions
and environmental regulations. This baseline suggests very modest
growth in ethanol demand through 2002.  The dotted line depicts
the impact elimination of the excise tax exemption is expected
to have on ethanol production. Without a market ethanol producers
indicate that they would be forced to sharply curtail operations
and abandon new investment.  The impact on the industry would
be felt within months of a repeal decision, and the impact on
the economy would follow directly.
</FONT>
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="aus2.GIF"></center>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">According to the Renewable Fuels Association,
the national trade association representing the ethanol industry,
ethanol will be produced in over 50 plants in 17 states in 1996.
 Over 90 percent of ethanol production capacity is concentrated
in the major Mid-western corn producing states of Illinois, Iowa,
Nebraska, Minnesota., Indiana, and Kansas.  Despite the geographic
concentration of the industry, ethanol is produced in all regions
of the country.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The partial exemption from the excise
tax on motor fuels was originally enacted to achieve several objectives.
The first of these was to enhance national security by reducing
dependence on imported oil through replacement with a domestically
produced alternative. The United States has an  insatiable appetite
for energy, particularly energy derived from oil and other petrochemicals.
While success in conservation and improved efficiency has slowed
growth in energy use over the past several decades, dependence
on imported  oil has increased significantly.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Ethanol is used as an oxygenate and
is virtually equivalent on a one-to-one basis with MTBE which
is produced from petrochemical feedstocks.  If domestically produced
ethanol was not available, an additional 1.6 billion gallons of
MTBE would be required to meet existing environmental requirements.
 Virtually all of this additional MTBE would have to be imported.
 This would reduce the U.S. merchandise trade balance by $1.3
billion annually.  
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">A second objective of the excise tax
exemption was to create an additional market for agricultural
commodities that would provide market-based support for prices
and lessen the dependence of farmers on government subsidies.
 The  ethanol industry has been an unqualified success in creating
an important domestic market for grain.  Ethanol currently accounts
for 6.2 percent of total corn utilization and is the third largest
individual use of corn. Ethanol accounts for about 14 cents of
the value of every bushel of corn marketed by American farmers.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The 553 million bushels of corn purchased
to manufacture ethanol last year directly provided $1.3 billion
of cash receipts for U.S. corn growers.  This amounted to six
percent  of the total gross income for corn growers.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Ethanol also provides significant net
positive environmental benefits.  Ethanol adds oxygen to gasoline
which reduces exhaust emissions of ozone-forming VOC's and carbon
monoxide.  It is widely used in reformulated gasolines currently
being sold in ozone non-attainment areas across the country. 
Because ethanol adds octane to gasoline, it also reduces the use
of other highly toxic petroleum-derived octane enhancers such
as benzene, toluene, and xylene.  And because it is produced from
agricultural feedstocks, ethanol is the only transportation motor
fuel which helps to reduce global warming.  Ethanol's environmental
promise was summarized by EPA Administrator Carol Browner at a
recent Senate hearing, &quot;expanding the use of renewable fuels
can help clean up our air and lower emissions of harmful greenhouse
gasses.&quot;
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The ethanol industry has successfully
accomplished each of these objectives.  
</FONT>
<p>
<HR>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">ANALYSIS</FONT></B>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The ethanol industry makes a significant
contribution to the overall U.S. economy and the  economies of
the states where production is concentrated.  This contribution
can be measured in terms of increased final demand for goods and
services from other industries; jobs provided by the ethanol industry
as well as other industries that supply ethanol producers; and
additional household income for all Americans.  Finally, the federal
government and states receive tax revenue from personal, business, and corporate
income taxes paid on wages and additional income generated as
a result of the operation of the ethanol industry. 
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Estimation of the benefits of the ethanol
industry to the American economy involved a multi-stage process.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  The first steps involved collecting
information about current ethanol production by state and outlining
the growth in ethanol demand over the next seven years. Much of
this information was provided by the ethanol industry through
the Renewable Fuels Association. Projected growth in ethanol demand
is described in Figure 2 above and summarized in Appendix Table
1. 
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  The value of output of the ethanol
industry in constant 1996 dollars was estimated by multiplying
annual production by the 1996 average  price of ethanol estimated
at $1.32 per gallon.  This provided annual estimates of the value
of final demand delivered by the food processing sector.  The
food processing sector contains corn milling firms that produce
ethanol.  These estimates are summarized in Appendix Table 2.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  Since the major input for the ethanol
industry is grain, we estimated the contribution of the corn used
for ethanol production on agricultural output, prices, and farm
income.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">This was accomplished by performing
a simulation of an econometric model of the agricultural sector.
 The baseline agricultural forecast incorporates the major provisions
of the 1996 Farm Bill and a continuation of the excise tax exemption
for ethanol. The simulation to determine the &quot;value added&quot;
by ethanol was triggered by reducing the amount of corn used for
ethanol production from an average of 645 million bushels  to
162 million bushels annually.  This reduction is consistent with
the impact on ethanol production the industry anticipates in the
absence of the incentives provided by the excise tax exemption.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  The annual economic contribution of
the ethanol industry was estimated by applying output, earnings,
and employment multipliers to the value of industry output, wages,
and industry employment of ethanol producers for each producing
state and the United States as a whole.  The state and national
level multipliers used in this analysis were taken from the Regional
Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II) of the U.S. Department
of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis.</FONT>
<p>
<HR>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">BENEFITS OF ETHANOL</FONT></B>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The ethanol industry makes a significant
contribution to the American economy.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  <B>Ethanol will add almost $51 billion
(1996$) of final demand to the entire American economy.</B>  The
goods and services purchased by ethanol producers represent purchases
of final demand of other industries.  These include purchases
of corn and other grain from farmers (agriculture), natural gas,
electricity, water and sewer, and telephone (utilities), and accounting
and legal services (business services).  Each of these supplier
industries  in turn purchases inputs from other industries.  If
ethanol producers were no longer in business  these supplier firms
would have to find alternative markets for their output.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">    <B>Farm income for crop producers
will be $2.2 billion, or nearly 3 percent, higher each year because
of ethanol production.</B><BR>
Increased demand for grain grown by
American farmers provides market support for prices and incomes.
 If the market for ethanol did not exist, corn stocks would rise,
prices would fall, profitability would decline and farmers would
be encouraged to plant other crops.  Since payments to farmers
under the 1996 farm bill are fixed and cannot vary with stocks
and prices, price declines associated with a collapse of demand
will directly affect cash farm income.  When all crop shifts caused
by changes in relative crop profitability are accounted for, net
income for American grain farmers is $15.6 billion higher over
the next seven years than would be the case without an ethanol
incentive.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  <B>Ethanol supports 55,500 jobs each
year: </B><br>
Ethanol production directly accounts for over 5,800
jobs in the food processing industry in 17 states.  As demand
for ethanol grows, the number of people directly employed by the
industry will also increase.  Additionally, the spending of ethanol
manufacturers on goods and services, which represents the creation
of final demand, will indirectly support an average of 48,900
jobs annually throughout  all other industries in the entire economy.
 These jobs would be lost if ethanol production ceased due to
loss of the excise tax exemption.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  <B>Ethanol generates income for all
Americans as the wages paid to the workers who produce ethanol
are spent and re-spent throughout the entire economy. </B> <br>
The ethanol industry directly pays $277 million in wages to employees.
These employees and their families spend this income thereby creating
demand.  The indirect impact adds another $1.8 billion to household
income annually.  Over the seven-year period 1996-2002, ethanol
production will increase total household income by $12.5 billion.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  <B>Ethanol contributes over $2 billion
annually to the U.S. trade balance</B>. <br>
By displacing imported MTBE ethanol reduces the U.S. merchandise trade deficit by about
$1.3 billion annually.  But the trade implications of ethanol
don't stop with MTBE.  The majority of the by-products of ethanol
production -- corn gluten feed and gluten meal -- are exported.
 This further reduces the trade deficit by earning over $800 million
annually. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  <B>Ethanol generates $555 million
of net tax revenue for the Federal Treasury annually through personal
and business income tax receipts.</B>  <br>
The excise tax exemption for alcohol fuels represents a cost to 
the U.S. Treasury through foregone
revenue. The Joint Tax Committee estimated that the exemption
would cost $2.5 billion in revenues over the five-year 1996-2000
period. Extrapolation through 2002 based on ethanol production
estimates discussed earlier suggests that the cost of the exemption
over the seven-year period would total $3.5 billion. However,
this &quot;cost&quot; must be offset by the additional revenues
that will be provided by taxes on household and farm income that
are generated and supported by the ethanol industry. The ethanol
industry will generate $7.4 billion in additional income taxes
over the next seven years, nearly $3.9 billion more than the estimated
cost of the partial excise tax exemption in forgone tax revenues.While
these economic impacts are concentrated in the major ethanol producing
states, nearly all states benefit from the existence of the industry.
 This reflects the fact that goods and services freely flow across
state borders and no individual state is self sufficient in everything
needed for manufacturing.  For example, while an Iowa ethanol
producer may purchase corn from an Iowa corn farmer, the machinery
he uses to process the corn may have been made in Illinois or
Pennsylvania; his advertising and public relations may be provided
by a firm in Chicago or New York; and his business insurance underwritten
by a New Jersey or Connecticut insurer.</FONT>
<P>
<HR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Implications of the 1996 Farm Bill for 
ethanol</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The 1996 Farm Bill provides the first
major redesign of federal agricultural support programs since
they were developed in the 1930s.  Chief among these changes is
formally breaking the link between eligibility for farm program
payments and production, and removal of ARP authority.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Prior to 1996 government payments to
farmers were determined by a confluence of legislatively-set target
prices and market prices. In order to qualify for program payments
eligibility farmers had to agree to set aside, or not plant, a
certain percentage of their acreage base annually and comply with
conservation provisions.  Farmers were discouraged from planting
non-program crops such as soybeans on their acreage bases since
they would lose program eligibility on that land.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The Secretary of Agriculture used the
Acreage Reduction Program (ARP), or set-aside, provisions of the
farm bill to manage supply and government budget exposure. The
basic parameters for ARPs for the major program crops were established
in the five-year farm bills.  The legislation gave the Secretary
discretion to establish annual set-asides subject to the ratio
of ending stocks to total demand.  A high ratio signaled a surplus
condition which generally depressed market prices.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Since government payments were determined
by a deficiency payment rate which was the difference between
the legislated target price and the higher of the market price
or the loan rate, large supplies and low prices generally resulted
in increased government payments.  Under the new farm bill, deficiency
payments are replaced by declining fixed payments over a seven-year
contract period.  Farmers  know in advance how much they can expect
from government payments each year through 2002.  They also know
that these payments will be unchanged by market conditions.  
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The 1996 Farm Bill removes the ARP as
a supply management tool and gives farmers virtually complete
flexibility to plant whatever crops they choose based on signals
from the marketplace.  Therefore, a shock to demand such as a
sharp decline in ethanol production, would increase stocks and
reduce prices and, therefore, profitability.  Under the new farm
bill farmers are free to shift as much of their corn acreage as
they desire to whatever crop they think will be more profitable
during the next season. If corn profitability declines, growers
would shift acreage to other crops such as soybeans, wheat, and
cotton (in the South).  Production of these crops would increase,
their prices would fall, and the planting decision process would
be reevaluated in the following spring.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Since annual government payments to
farmers are fixed, net income will be more fully exposed to a
decline in market prices than has been the case for the past fifty
years. This means a shock to demand that reduces prices will be
directly absorbed by farmers through reduced farm income. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The ethanol industry also benefits farmers
through ownership of manufacturing plants.  According to the Renewable
Fuels Association 8 of the 50 operating ethanol plants in 1996
are farmer-owned cooperatives.  These plants account for over
200 million gallons, or about 20 percent, of ethanol production. 
Removal of the excise tax exemption would force these plants to
close and would remove another important source of income for
the farmer-owners. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Our analysis  suggests that ethanol
makes the following contribution to the agricultural economy:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  
<ul>
<li>Corn plantings would average 81.8
million acres over the 1996-2002 period, 3.4 million acres higher
than would be the case without ethanol. <p>  
<li>Ending stocks of corn
stocks would total one billion bushels by August 31, 2002 providing
an average stocks to use ratio (a measure of the adequacy of supplies
to meet demand) of 11 percent over the seven-year period.  In
the absence of ethanol demand stocks would be 20 percent higher.<p>
<li>The demand for corn represented by the ethanol industry will
provide an average farm level price for corn of $2.65 over the
1996-2002 period.  This is 4.6 percent higher than would be the
case without the ethanol industry.

<h3><b>Economic Growth</b></h3>
<br><br>
<img src="t.gif" align="left">he ethanol industry contributes positively to the U.S. economy, particularly rural communities where ethanol production is often based, by providing direct and indirect jobs and increasing corn prices and rural income. Increases in ethanol production offer enormous potential for overall economic growth and additional employment in these smaller communities. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has concluded that a 100 million gallon ethanol facility could create 2,250 local jobs for a single community.
<br><br>
An economic outlook of the U.S. ethanol industry over the seven year period, 1996 to 2002, concluded:
<br><br>
<ul><li><b>Ethanol will add $51 billion (1996$) to the entire U.S. economy.</b><br>
The goods and services purchased by ethanol producers represent increased final demand for other industries. These include purchases of grain, natural gas, electricity, water and sewer, telephone, and accounting and legal services. Each of these supplier industries in turn purchase inputs from other industries.
<br><br>
<img src="economic.gif" align="right">
<li><b>Farm income for crop producers will be $2.2 billion, or nearly 3%, higher each year because of ethanol production.</b>
<br>Increased demand for grain grown by American farmers provides market support for prices and incomes.<br>
<br>
<li><b>Ethanol supports 55,000 jobs.</b><br>
Ethanol production directly accounts for over 5,800 jobs in the food/fuel processing industry in 17 states. Additionally, the spending of ethanol manufacturers on goods and services indirectly supports an average of 48,900 jobs annually throughout all other industries in the entire economy. Increases in ethanol production offer enormous potential for overall economic growth and additional employment in smaller communities where ethanol production is often based.<br><br>
<li><b>Ethanol production will increase total household income by $12.5 billion over the next seven years.</b><br>
The ethanol industry directly pays $277 million in wages to employees. These employees and their families spend this income, thereby creating demand. The indirect impact of ethanol production adds another $1.8 billion to household income annually.<br><br>
<li><b>Ethanol generates $555 million of net tax revenue for the Federal Treasury annually through personal and business income tax receipts.</b><br>
Additional revenues provided by taxes on household and farm income that are generated and supported by the ethanol industry offset the cost of the partial ethanol excise tax exemption for ethanol-blended gasolines.
</ul>
<br>
<center>
<img src="econb.gif">
</center>
<h3><b>Trade</b></h3><br>
Ethanol contributes over $2 billion annually to the U.S. trade balance. By displacing imported MTBE, ethanol reduces the U.S. merchandise trade deficit by about $1.3 billion annually. But the trade implications of ethanol do not stop with MTBE. The majority of the by-products of ethanol production - corn gluten feed and gluten meal - are exported. This further reduces the trade deficit by earning over $800 million annually.
<br><br>
<h3><b>Budget Impact</b></h3><br>
Past analyses of the ethanol industry have concluded that the production of ethanol actually saves the federal government money in reduced farm program costs and increased rural income. The General Accounting Office concluded in 1995 that the reductions in farm program costs attributable to the increased demand for corn created by the ethanol industry more than offset the cost of the ethanol tax incentive. The historic farm bill passed in 1996 detaches farm program payments from production, a fundamental change in federal farm policy.  An economic analysis by AUS Consultants found that while the ethanol industry can no longer point to the budgetary savings of reduced farm program costs, the ethanol program will continue to save the government money because the industry generates considerable household and farm income that results in increased federal tax revenue.

<title>TRANSPORTATION</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<h3>Transportation</h3>
<P>
<img align=left src="t.gif">oday, millions of cars powered by ethanol-blended fuels are on America's roads, and the number continues to grow. While ethanol's original use was as a gasoline extender, today ethanol is marketed as a high quality octane booster and oxygenate capable of reducing emissions and improving automobile performance. Ethanol-blended fuel sales represent over 11% of all automotive fuels sold in the United States.  Ethanol is a versatile fuel, used as a blend component, a feedstock for ethers and as a replacement or alternative fuel.<br>
<br>
<h3>Major Automakers Recommend Ethanol<br>
</h3>
<P>
Ethanol blends are approved under the warranties of all domestic and foreign automobile manufacturers marketing vehicles in the United States. In fact, the nation's top three auto-makers, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, recommend the use of oxygenated fuels, such as ethanol, because of their clean air benefits.<br>
<br>
<h3>ETBE
</h3>
<P>
Clean Air Act requirements to make cleaner burning, reformulated gasoline (RFG) with lower volatility and fewer toxins have created an increased interest in ethanol-based ethers such as ETBE (ethyl tertiary butyl ether). ETBE is a chemical compound produced by reacting ethanol and isobutylene (a petroleum-derived by-product of the refining process). Relative to other oxygenates, ethanol-based ethers provide refiners with greater flexibility and economic advantages in making reformulated gasoline. ETBE has characteristics superior to other ethers including:<Br>


<img align=right src="transp1.gif">


<ul>
<li>low volatility
<li>low water solubility
<li>high octane value
<li>excellent distillation curve response
<li>large reductions in carbon monoxide (CO) and<br>
hydrocarbon (HC) emissions
<li>superior drive-ability
</ul>
<br>
<BR>
ETBE also enhances energy security by displacing more gasoline produced from imported crude, and reduces our dependency on imported methanol and MTBE sources for reformulated gasoline production.<br>
<br>
These combined characteristics establish ETBE as one of the most cost-effective means for refiners to reduce gasoline volatility. As federal and state air quality programs continue to require reductions in fuel volatility, the marketplace opportunities for ETBE will continue to grow.<br>
<br>

</ul>
<br>
<h3>E-85/E-90/E-100 Fleets</h3>
<P>
<img align="right" src="transb.gif">
Provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1990 and the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 created significant new market opportunities for alternative fuels, by phasing in requirements for fleet vehicles to operate on cleaner fuels.<br>
<br>
In the United States, state governments are recognizing the economic, energy and environmental benefits of fuel ethanol. A number of Midwestern States operate as many E-85 vehicles (blend of 85% ethanol/15% conventional gasoline) as the federal government. Heavy duty vehicles are also being operated on blends of 90% ethanol (E-90) and 100% ethanol (E-100) in successful demonstration programs. In ten years as many as 5 million vehicles may be running on non-petroleum motor fuels.<br>
<br>
In Brazil, where ethanol has been used in blends with gasoline since 1939, the government mandated the production of neat-ethanol fueled vehicles in order to reduce its dependence on imported energy while providing value added markets for its sugar cane producers.  Today, there are more than 4.2 million ethanol-powered vehicles (approximately 40% of the total fleet of passenger vehicles) operating in Brazil.<br>
<br>
<h3>Biodiesel</h3>
<P>
Animal fats and vegetable oils are reacted with methyl or ethyl alcohol and sodium hydroxide (esterfication) to produce biodiesel (methyl or ethyl ester).  Alcohol ester can be made from many vegetable oils including soybeans, sunflowers, corn or palm.  Biodiesel can be used as a substitute for or blended with diesel fuel. The benefits of biodiesel fuels include:<br>

<ul>
<li>Biodiesel is organic and biodegradable.
<li>Biodiesel mileage and power performance are comparable to conventional diesel.
<li>Biodiesel is safer because it has a high flash point and does not produce combustible air mixtures under normal conditions.
<li>Biodiesel mixes easily and completely with conventional diesel fuel and requires no modifications to fuel systems.
<li>Biodiesel contains no sulfur so it does not create sulfur dioxide, a major source of acid rain, when combusted.
<li>Biodiesel burns clean because it contains oxygenates.  Smoke is reduced by 70% when biodiesel is burned as a pure fuel and 25% when burned as an 80/20 diesel/alcohol ester blend.
</ul>
<br>
Biodiesel is widely used in Europe and in some U.S. cities to meet air emission standards. The city of St. Louis, Missouri, operates a fleet of 164 buses on a biodiesel blend of 30% biodiesel and 70% diesel. Several research programs are underway on the growth and processing of safflower and rapeseed oils into biodiesel.<br>

<h3>Home-Grown</h3>
<BR>
<BR>
<img align=left src="e.gif">thanol is an alcohol fuel made by fermenting the sugars found in corn, wheat and other biomass sources, including agricultural waste products. Ethanol has been present since the dawn of the automobile. In 1908, Henry Ford designed his Model T to run on alcohol, proclaiming it the fuel of the future. More recently, ethanol-blended fuels have won wide consumer acceptance. Since 1980, over two trillion miles have been driven on ethanol-blended fuels. 

<img align=right src="producti.gif">





<H3>Ethanol Production</H3>
<P>
Today, there are approximately 50 commercial facilities producing fuel ethanol in more than 20 different states across the country. Domestic ethanol producers have invested over $4 billion in private sector resources to construct modern and efficient ethanol production facilities.
<P>
Alcohol fuel can be produced in all regions of the country, from a wide variety of feedstocks, including grains, forest residues, citrus and urban wastes, and special energy crops.  Ethanol production is labor intensive, and results in balanced and dispersed job creation.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Farmer-Owned Cooperatives</h3>
<P>
As the domestic ethanol industry continues to grow, the industry is witnessing a surge in the construction of farmer-owned ethanol production facilities.  American farmers are realizing added benefits attributable to the ethanol industry through ownership of manufacturing plants.
<P>
<h3>Value-Added Agriculture</h3>
<P>
Today, the majority of ethanol produced in the U.S. is made from corn. Almost 60 percent of the ethanol made from corn is manufactured in wet milling plants that also produce sweeteners, starches and corn oil.  The remaining 40 percent is produced by corn dry milling plants that also make distillers grains, corn meal and other food ingredients.
<P>
<h3>Future Ethanol Production From Biomass</h3>
<P>
While most ethanol today is made from corn, the Renewable Fuels Association is enthusiastic about the potential for making ethanol from biomass, including waste products like corn fiber, rice straw, sawdust, pulp and paper sludge and yard clippings; or from energy crops such as switch grass, prairie grasses and fast-growing trees. These sources offer tremendous opportunities for new jobs for the rural economy, as well as environmental benefits through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

Fuel ethanol is derived from a diversity of renewable feedstocks including grain, cheese whey, citrus wastes and forestry residues. With corn being the predominant feedstock used, fuel ethanol represents an important and major domestic "value-added" market for U.S. corn farmers.<BR><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="cornchar.gif"></CENTER><BR>Ethanol's important agricultural benefits include:<BR><UL><LI>Ethanol creates value-added markets for America's farmers, stimulating rural economies by increasing corn prices and rural income.<P><LI>Each 100 million bushel increase in the demand for corn results in a corn price increase of 8 to 10 cents per bushel.<P><LI>Ethanol accounts for 14 cents of the value of every bushel of corn marketed by American farmers.<P><LI>Ethanol accounts for 6.2 percent of total corn utilization in the U.S. and is the third largest individual use of corn, behind only feed use and exports.<P><LI>For each 100 million bushels of corn used in increased ethanol production, the ripple effects on the price of other commodities adds 2 cents per bushel to the price of wheat and 10 to 13 cents to the price of soy beans.<P><LI>Total direct and indirect benefits to farmers and ranchers who produce corn, wheat and other grains exceeded $3 billion in 1995.</UL><BR><BR>The production of ethanol does NOT mean less corn available for food. Instead, ethanol production actually produces many valuable high protein food and feed co-products.  An acre of corn (125 bushels) produces 313 gallons of ethanol, 1,362 pounds of 21% distillers grains (protein feed for livestock), 325 pounds of 60% gluten meal, and 189 pounds of corn oil.<BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="bushelpi.gif"></CENTER><BR><BR><H3>Distillers Grains</h3><BR>Distillers grains are a byproduct of the production of ethanol from grain and can be used for feed in most every type of animal system. Approximately 1.4 billion tons of distillers grains are produced annually, and the value derived from this market is critical to the economic viability of ethanol production.<P>Distillers grains are rich in protein, energy, fat, minerals and vitamins with readily available sugars, lactic acid and other short chain fatty acids. Distillers grains are widely recognized as a cost-efficient, nutritional, digestible and highly palatable protein feed for dairy and beef cattle, sheep and swine. The high bypass protein and low starch content are ideally suited to keep animals healthy and profitable.<BR><center><img src="blue_line.gif" width="100%"></center><p><a href="rfa.html"><img src="b_emblem.gif"></a>Return to <a href="rfa.html">RFA Home Page</a></body></html>

Considering the fact that Saudi Arabia is the worlds largest producer of oil on a daily basis, on an annual basis, that interest for our economy and the economy of allies in Europe and Japan is a vital, national interest.

But the price for that low cost energy is high. Two-thirds of the world's known oil reserves are located in the Persian Gulf. By the year 2010, analysts believe that more than 75% of the world's petroleum needs will be met by Arab nations. Our growing reliance on imported crude oil from the world's most politically volatile region most certainly jeopardizes our nation's economic and national security.<br><br>The price Americans pay for oil at the gasoline pump does not reflect this huge national security cost. To encourage regional geo-political stability and preserve the flow of oil, the federal government provides naval protection for the sea lanes; foreign aid to friendly regimes; and, as demonstrated by the Persian Gulf war, a commitment to use our own military forces when necessary. In addition, the U.S. maintains a Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help us weather any temporary supply disruptions.<br><br><br><h3><b>Real Price of Foreign Oil</b></h3><table><td><tr><img src="gaspump.gif" align="right">The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimates the military costs associated with preserving our energy security to be $35 billion per year.  That means for every $20 barrel of oil, U.S. taxpayers are paying an additional $12 to preserve and protect Mideast oil supplies. Other estimates of the real price of a barrel of oil range much higher.  According to the Economic Strategy Institute, a barrel of foreign oil costs $80. The Rocky Mountain Institute estimates the cost at $106 a barrel. The U.S. General Accounting Office calculates the cost of a barrel of foreign oil as high as $126. <br><br>Our military watch is very costly not just in taxpayer dollars for military expenditures in the volatile region, but also in terms of American lives. In addition to the lives lost in the Persian Gulf war, many view the increasing terrorist activity around the world as just the beginning of an organized resistance to the U.S. presence in the Middle East.<br><br><br></tr></td></table>



<h3><b>Monopoly Pricing of Oil</b></h3><br>Far more threatening to the U.S. economy than the military costs to assure stability in the Mideast is the growing potential for monopoly pricing as the world moves back toward dependence on Persian Gulf oil. According to the DOE, worldwide oil reserves are becoming more concentrated and the world oil market share accounted for by a small number of countries continues to rise. DOE estimates that losses to the U.S. economy from monopoly pricing of oil ranged from $100-$470 billion per year between 1974 and 1990.<br><br><br><h3><b>Strategic Petroleum Reserve</b></h3><br>The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 established a Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), of  up to one billion barrels of petroleum products, to assure continued supplies of oil during a national emergency as well as reduce the impacts of a severe energy supply disruption.

Clearly, American taxpayers would be better served by increasing the development and production of alternatives to imported oil, such as ethanol. Promoting domestic, renewable energy sources will increase energy security while ensuring that limited federal resources are spent in the U.S. and not exported offshore in the form of jobs, military protection and American lives. The expanded use of alternatives to petroleum, including renewable ethanol, biodiesel, wind, solar, geothermal, hydro-power, as well as increased domestic oil and gas exploration and production, can fill a market need currently met with imports.</body><center><img src="blue_line.gif" width="100%"></center><p><a href="rfa.html"><img src="b_emblem.gif"></a>Return to <a href="rfa.html">RFA Home Page</a></html>

<h3>Oil Displacement<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>U.S. Oil Dependency at Historic Level</b></h3>
In 1970, the U.S. imported 23% of its petroleum needs. By 1973, 
U.S. oil imports grew to 35%.  Today, we import over 54% of our oil. 
The Department of Energy's independent Energy Information Administration 
(EIA) projects this import share will increase to over 60% by 2010. U.S. 
consumers spend an average of $50 billion annually on oil imports.
<br>
<br>
The transportation sector is a key contributor to our oil dependence. Ninety-seven percent of U.S. transportation energy is petroleum-based in the form of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Over 61% of U.S. oil demand for transportation is imported. The growth in the use of oil, mostly for gasoline, combined with declining U.S. oil production and limited use of alternative fuels are driving the growth in oil imports.
<br>
<br>
<CENTER>
<Table border><TR><TD Width=450>
<i>"Growing dependence on oil imports from insecure sources...threatens energy security, undermines the U.S. economy, and costs American jobs. Heavy dependence also contributes to the already massive U.S. trade deficit. In 1990, payments for foreign oil amounted to $61.3 billion - about 60% of the total trade deficit."</i>

</table></CENTER>
<br><br>
<br>
<h3><b>Future World Oil Demand</b></h3>
It is generally agreed that global demand for oil, mainly from developing nations, will grow by 22-34% over the next 15 years. The EIA projects that the world will consume another 20 million barrels of oil a day (MMBD) by the year 2010, up from 69 MMBD in 1995.  The use of ethanol-blended fuel can play a significant role in meeting the growing energy demand. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, "ethanol is the most energy efficient of all liquid transportation fuels, yielding 125% of the energy used in growing the corn, harvesting it, and distilling it into ethanol." In comparison, gasoline production is only 75-80 percent efficient.<br>
<br><br>
<h3><b>OPEC's Share of the World Oil Market</b></h3>
Reflecting the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) control over a majority of the world's oil reserves and increasing world demand, OPEC's share of the world oil market has steadily increased since the mid-1980s. OPEC's control of 66% of the world's proven oil reserves and 55% of the crude oil ultimate resources increases the likelihood of an oil shock.<br>
<br>
According to projections in the EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 1996 "reference case," crude oil imports "are expected to increase by about 2 million barrels per day by 2000" and that by the year 2000, "OPEC will account for more than half of all U.S. petroleum imports."<br>
<br><br>
<h3><b>MTBE Imports Also on the Rise</b></h3>
Imports of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), a methanol-based chemical additive manufactured by the major international oil companies, are rising steadily. MTBE imports have risen from 30 million gallons in 1990 to more than 750 million gallons in 1995, a 24-fold increase in just 5 years. Moreover, the majority of MTBE imports are from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries. In 1995, 70% of U.S. imports of MTBE came from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries. Saudi Arabia supplied 47%, with the other OPEC nations supplying 23%.<br>
<br>
<CENTER><img src="MTBEImports.gif">
<BR>
<BR><img src="Imports.gif"></CENTER>
<br><br><br>
While MTBE imports have been growing rapidly over the past several years, this is the first time that the dependence on OPEC countries for the oxygenate has been so apparent. The trend is clearly toward greater MTBE imports, and a greater dependence on OPEC.<br>
<br><br>
<h3><b>Ethanol Displaces Energy Imports</b></h3>
According to a recent poll conducted by Research Strategy Management for the Sustainable Energy Budget Coalition, 75% of American voters believe the country needs to do something to reduce its dependence on foreign oil. Of these voters, 90% support efforts to develop renewable energy alternatives to oil. Using ethanol, a renewable, clean-burning, domestic fuel, displaces imported oil and will aid the U.S. in meeting its energy demand.
<br><br>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has estimated that the same amount of crude oil needed to produce a British thermal unit (Btu) of gasoline can produce over eight Btus of ethanol. Thus, ethanol can be used to leverage domestic crude oil supplies by a factor of 8.

<HEAD><TITLE>Less Pollution</TITLE></HEAD>
<H3>Less Pollution</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<img align=left src="e.gif">thanol, a renewable fuel made from agricultural crops, is one of the best tools we have to fight urban air pollution. Ethanol reduces pollution through the volumetric displacement of gasoline, and by adding oxygen to the combustion process which helps to greatly reduce exhaust emissions. In fact, the use of ethanol results in reductions in every pollutant regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including ozone, air toxics, carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM10) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). The EPA considers ozone to be the most widespread air pollution problem. Ethanol provides the following environmental benefits:
<BR>
<BR>
<h3>Reduced CO Emissions</h3>
<P>
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, poisonous gas that reduces the flow of oxygen in the bloodstream. It is formed by the incomplete combustion of petroleum fuels, which contain no oxygen. The EPA attributes two-thirds of CO emissions to transportation sources. Ethanol, since it contains oxygen, contributes to a cleaner, more efficient burn of gasoline which results in lower CO exhaust emissions. The EPA recognizes that the use of ethanol-blended fuels can reduce CO emissions from vehicle exhaust by as much as 30%. In addition to being a deadly poison, CO has been recognized as an ozone precursor since 1976.
<P>
<H3>Reduced Exhaust VOC Emissions/Ozone Formation</h3>
<P>
Ethanol reduces VOC emissions from automobile exhaust by adding oxygen to the gasoline, which results in more complete (cleaner) combustion. Reductions in exhaust VOCs are very important because exhaust emissions are very reactive, and therefore tend to form ozone more quickly and readily. Several studies have shown that by reducing exhaust VOC emissions and CO emissions, ethanol can help to reduce urban ozone more than any other fuel.
<P>
<img align=right src="less3.gif">




<H3>Reduced NOx Emissions</H3>
<P>
Another contributor to the formation of urban ozone is NOx. Several components of gasoline will greatly impact NOx emissions, including sulfur, olefins and aromatics. By displacing these components, ethanol can also help to reduce NOx emissions from motor fuels.
<P>
<H3>Reduced Air Toxics Emissions</H3>
<P>
A large fraction of the octane needed for todays gasolines comes from toxic aromatic components such as benzene, toluene, xylene and tri-methyl benzenes. Ethanol provides an alternative to these octane enhancers, allowing significant reductions in toxic air emissions without sacrificing fuel performance.
<P>
<h3>Reduced Particulate Matter (PM10) Emissions</h3>
<P>
Particulate matter with a diameter of less than 10 micrometers (PM10) is emitted from a variety of stationary and mobile sources. PM10 is regulated by the EPA because these small airborne particles can reach the lower regions of the respiratory tract and cause serious health problems, including damage to lung tissue, cancer and premature death. The use of ethanol significantly reduces tailpipe emissions of PM10 from gasoline, and thus contributes to improved public health.
<P>
<h3>Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h3>
<P>
Unlike virtually all other liquid fuels which come from fossil hydrocarbons, such as gasoline and natural gas, ethanol is produced from renewable feedstocks, including agricultural crops and forest residues, citrus and urban wastes and special energy crops. Fossil fuels essentially release carbon trapped in the soil into the atmosphere, where it reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas that traps the earth's heat, contributing to global warming. Plants, on the other hand, 'breathe' CO2 and give off oxygen, thereby maintaining the balance of CO2 in the atmosphere. The increased use of renewable biomass fuels like ethanol will partially offset the global warming effect of burning gasoline.
<P>
A U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) analysis concludes that the use of ethanol reduces CO2 emissions 27% more than gasoline, as well as reducing other greenhouse gases such as sulfur dioxide (SO2). Ethanol-blended fuels are the only commercially available fuels which have a CO2 benefit.
<P>
<BR>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD valign=top>
<h3>Ethanol - The Clean Air Solution</h3>
<P>
Because of their environmental benefits, the Clean Air Act requires the addition of oxygenates such as ethanol to gasoline in areas that exceed public health standards for ozone and CO, known as nonattainment areas. Today, approximately 35% of the nations gasoline contains some level of oxygenate in order to reduce harmful emissions and improve our nation's air quality.</TD>

NATIONAL ETHANOL CONFERENCE PROVES TO BE TREMENDOUS SUCCESS</B></center></H3>
<P>
More than 300 attendees gathered in Chicago earlier this week to listen to industry leaders, policy makers and gasoline marketers discuss the outlook for ethanol in the U.S. motor fuel market as we enter the 21st century. Highlights of the conference were keynote policy addresses by Senator Dick Durbin(D-IL), American Farm Bureau Federation(AFBF) President Dean Kleckner, and Rep. Denny Hastert(R-IL).
<P>
Senator Durbin, while mindful of the legislative battle that looms in the 105th Congress regarding elimination of the ethanol tax incentive, expressed optimism that the tax incentive would be maintained.  A leading advocate of the domestic ethanol industry, Senator Durbin also stated that he plans to introduce legislation this year to extend the ethanol tax incentive beyond the year 2000, when it is currently slated to expire.
<P>
AFBF President Dean Kleckner spoke about the importance of ethanol production to American agriculture and rural economies.  Rep. Denny Hastert(R-IL) expressed his strong support for the ethanol industry and the importance of maintaining the ethanol tax incentive (See p. 3).
<P>
Tom Winninger of the Winninger Institute gave a dynamic and thought-provoking presentation to ethanol marketers and blenders, admonishing the industry to be more creative and aggressive in marketing their product.

GAO CONCLUDES IMPORTING LOW-COST OIL PROVIDES LARGE ECONOMIC BENEFITS</B></CENTER></H3>
<P>
The General Accounting Office(GAO) has issued a report stating that the U.S. economy benefits to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars annually by using low-cost imported oil rather than relying on "more expensive" domestic energy sources.  The report, <I>"Energy Security: Evaluating U.S. Vulnerability to Oil Supply Disruptions and Options for Mitigating Their Effects,"</I> was requested by House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich.
<P>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><I>
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER><TD><TR>
"I find it utterly irresponsible for the GAO to <BR>
go on record extolling the virtues of imported<BR>
oil to our economy."</BLOCKQUOTE></I></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><BR>
According to the GAO, compared with alternative domestic sources of energy, "imported oil represents a relatively low-cost source of fuel to the U.S. economy."  The report concludes that "U.S. consumers and businesses gain hundreds of billions of dollars in benefits annually from access to relatively low-cost foreign oil. 
These benefits accrue from avoiding the expenses of relying more extensively on higher-cost domestic energy. By most estimates, the day-to-day benefits for the United States of relying on low-cost fuel oil substantially exceed the occasional, but severe, costs of disruptions to the world oil supply." 
<P><BR>
"I find it utterly irresponsible for the GAO to go on record extolling the virtues of imported oil to our economy," said Eric Vaughn, President of the RFA.   "While major oil companies continue to export jobs overseas and gasoline-powered vehicles emit harmful pollutants, the GAO would rather see us continue down the road to increased oil imports rather than increase the production and use of cleaner-burning, domestically-produced fuels.  This is nonsense."
<P>
The Department of Energy was equally critical of the GAO's analysis.  According to the DOE, "the attempted comparison between the economic benefits of imported oil and the potential economic costs of vulnerability to oil shocks yields no insight into the overall consequences of oil imports."

<h3><CENTER><B>FEED CO-PRODUCT HANDBOOKS HIGHLIGHT VALUE OF ETHANOL BYPRODUCTS</center></B></H3>
<P>
Reflecting the growing importance of byproducts to the economic viability of ethanol production, the domestic ethanol industry and the nation's corn growers have produced two corn co-product reference handbooks describing the high quality corn co-products available to the feed industry.
<P>
The guides, "Feed Co-Products of the Corn Wet Milling Process" and "Feed Co-Products of the Corn Dry Milling Process," provide valuable information for the feeding industry on the nutritional, economic, production and use value of corn co-products.  Each handbook contains a description of the manufacturing of ethanol process, nutrient composition, livestock feeding trials, recommended feeding levels and references.
<P>
The RFA and the Iowa Corn Growers Association(ICGA) spearheaded the project.  "As corn growers work to increase the volume of value-added processing, the marketing of livestock co-products is critical to the success of the entire corn industry," said Tim Burrack, president, ICGA.  "Increased use of high-protein, economical feed ingredients from corn could boost profitability for the state's livestock producers."
<P>
The processes of producing ethanol for fuel and beverage alcohol utilize only the starch portion of the grain, leaving behind high-value, high-protein, high-vitamin content feed products called distillers dried grains or corn gluten feed.  These feeds can provide a nourishing supplement to livestock and poultry diets.
<P>
"The books will be a valuable resource tool for dairy producers, cattle feeders, the poultry industry, nutritionists, feed consultants, veterinarians and feed sales personnel," said Jerry Weigel, Director of Nutrition and Regulatory Affairs at ExSeed Genetics, L.L.C., and chief author of the handbooks.

<H3><B>HOUSE MEMBERS EXPRESS FIERCE OPPOSITION TO ELIMINATION 
OF ETHANOL TAX INCENTIVE</h3></B></CENTER>
<P>
<B><U>Rep. Hastert Sends Strong Message to Archer</B></U>
<BR>
The Illinois Republican Congressional delegation, led by Rep. Denny Hastert, Chief Deputy Whip, voiced its opposition to eliminating the partial excise tax exemption in a letter to Rep. Bill Archer, Chairman of the House Ways & Means Committee.  The Members wrote, "Recent reports have quoted you as saying the ethanol tax credit is anachronistic and needs to be updated.  While we share the strong conviction that sacrifices must be made to balance the budget, we do not believe our nation's farmers should be singled out."
<P>
"Ethanol and its tax treatment is not 'anachronistic.'  Rather, they are an integral part of American agriculture -- especially as we are continuing to reduce farm subsidies and ask farmers to seek more of their income through the marketplace.  It simply is not fair to ask farmers to look to the marketplace for their income and then, take a sizeable portion of the market away."
<P>
"New plants, as well as the expansion of existing facilities, are currently underway based on the fact that the excise tax exemption will remain until the year 2000.  These entrepreneurs count on the government keeping their word, not changing the rules in the middle of the game."

<BR>
Rep. Hastert also shared his outlook for the ethanol industry with attendees of the National Conference on Ethanol Policy & Marketing.  Rep. Hastert acknowledged that there is a tough battle ahead for the industry, but expressed confidence that any attempt to retreat from the government's committment to the ethanol industry would be soundly defeated.
<P>
<B><U>Rep. Minge Challenges Anti-Ethanol Bill</B></U>
<BR>
In response to a "Dear Colleague" from Rep. Phil English (R-PA) inviting co-sponsors of H.R. 161, legislation that would eliminate the ethanol tax incentive, Rep. David Minge (D-MN) invited Rep. English to "take a tour on any one of the four farmer-owned cooperative ethanol plants in my district.  You can talk face to face with any one of the 500-odd farmer-owners of any of these plants or folks who are concerned about the environment.  They can tell you the impact the ethanol tax exemption has had on them."
<P>
In his letter, Rep. Minge attempted to correct the several misstatements made in the Dear Colleague.  In response to the claim that ethanol does not provide environmental benefits, Rep. Minge countered, "according to the EPA, the use of ethanol-blended fuels reduces carbon monoxide emissions by 30% as well as reducing carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides(NOx), ozone, air toxics and particulate matter... I am sure your constituents in the Erie area would benefit from reductions of these pollutants by using ethanol blended fuel."
<P>
Rep. Minge noted, "If one subtracts the costs of the explicit and implicit subsidies that benefit the oil industry, you would quickly find that the subsidies we provide to the oil industry to make it competitive are far more expensive than this tax incentive."
<P>
In response to the statement that the ethanol incentive does not help farmers but rather one corporation, Rep. Minge replied, "I am proud to say that the second largest producer of ethanol is Minnesota Corn Processors, a 5000 strong farmer-owned cooperative in my district.  In fact, cooperatively-owned ethanol plants represent the future of the industry and have experienced the most growth in ethanol production during the last five years."
<P>
Rep. Minge plans to reintroduce legislation introduced in the last Congress(H.R. 2232) which would amend the Small Producers Tax Credit, a ten cents per gallon credit on the first 15 million gallons of ethanol produced. As currently written, farmer cooperatives are the only business entity that cannot take advantage of the credit.

<BR>
<I>The following article is the second in a series that will address some of the questions raised by Rep. Bill Archer (R-TX), Chairman of the House Ways & Means Committee, in his effort to undermine political support for the federal ethanol program:</I>
<P>
<B>What environmental benefits, if any, have the incentive produced?</B>
<P>
Ethanol has the highest oxygen content of any fuel additive available today. As such, ethanol will reduce exhaust or tailpipe emissions from vehicles more effectively than any other oxygenate.  Thus, ethanol and its ether derivative ETBE will provide significant reductions in carbon monoxide and ozone pollution, will displace toxics such as benzene, and will reduce NOx and particulate emissions.  Finally, because ethanol is produced from renewable agricultural feedstocks, ethanol is the only transportation fuel available today that will help to reduce greenhouse gases.
<P>
<B>EPA Administrator Carol Browner</B> testified before the Senate Agricultural Committee:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"renewable fuels are a vital part of the clean gasoline programs that are proving so successful in reducing air pollution in our nation's largest cities.  In addition to reducing dangerous smog and carbon monoxide, EPA believes renewable fuels can also help to combat the unhealthy heating of the Earth's atmosphere known as global warming."</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The environmental benefits of ethanol include:
<P>
<B><U>1.  Clean Volume":</B></U><BR>A large fraction of the octane needed for today's gasolines comes from toxic aromatic components such as benzene, touene, xylene and tri-methyl benzenes.  Ethanol provides an alternative to such octane enhancers, and allows significant reductions in toxic emissions, without sacrificing fuel performance.  It would not be possible for most refiners to meet the year-round 15% reduction in toxic emissions required by the Clean Air Act in a cost-effective fashion without the dilution effect of oxygenates, such as ethanol.
<P>
<B><U>2.  Reduced Carbon Monoxide Emissions:</B></U><BR>Because ethanol has the highest oxygen content of any fuel additive, it provides the greatest reductions in carbon monoxide(CO).  EPA data demonstrates that a 10% ethanol blend will reduce CO as much as 30%.  As a result, the use of ethanol in the oxy-fuel program for CO nonattainment areas has been critically important to the success of that program.  Since 1992, when the oxy-fuel program began, more than a third of the CO nonattainment areas have been redesignated as in compliance.
<P>
In addition to being a deadly poison itself, CO is a recognized ozone precursor.  Recently, the National Academy of Science noted the role of CO in the formation of urban ozone in its report, <U>Rethinking the Ozone Problem in Urban and Regional Air Pollution</U>.  By dramatically reducing CO emissions, even in the summer months when CO pollution itself may not present a health hazard, ethanol helps to reduce urban ozone.
<P>
<B><U>3.  Reduced Exhaust VOC Emissions:</B></U> Unlike low-RVP gasoline which only reduces evaporative VOC emissions, oxygenates reduce exhaust VOC emissions.  Reductions in exhaust VOC's are particularly important because exhaust emissions are higher in reactivity (a measure of ozone-forming potential) than evaporative emissions.  Moreover, as a percentage of total VOC emissions, it is now generally accepted that exhaust VOC's contribute greater mass than evaporative VOC's, and are more important in terms of reducing ozone.
<P>
<B><U>4.  Lower Reactivity:</B></U>  Oxygenates displace other more reactive components currently used in gasoline.  For example, certain aromatics, such as xylene, and olefins are highly reactive and will greatly exacerbate urban ozone.  Oxygenates are far less reactive and contribute very little to the formation of ozone.  By displacing such components through the reformulation of gasoline, oxygenates help to reduce ozone even more than the reductions in mass VOC exhaust emissions attributable to oxygen content would suggest.
<P>
<B><U>5.  Reduced NOx Emissions:</B></U>  NOx is also necessary for the formation of urban ozone.  EPA's complex model demonstrates that for some fuel formulations the NOx reduction from oxygenates is quite significant.  The benefit is largely attributable to the dilution effect of oxygenates.  Ethanol displaces other components of gasoline, such as sulfur, that increase NOx emissions.

ETHANOL-- AMERICA'S FUEL FOR THE 21st CENTURY</B>
<P>
By Leland Swenson, President, National Farmers Union</CENTER>
<P>
Skyrocketing prices for propane and other oil-based heating fuels have gotten the attention of the American public.  As a nation we spend millions, if not billions, of federal tax dollars each year assuring access to imported oil for a handful of multi-national corporations.  Nonetheless, as the 105th Congress reconvenes, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who chairs the powerful House Ways & Means Committee, is  calling for the elimination of the federal excise tax exemption and the blenders tax incentive on reformulated fuels, such as ethanol blended fuels.  In addition, many state legislatures are talking about the elimination or reduction of state excise tax exemptions on reformulated fuels.
<P>
National Farmers Union supports expansion of current national energy programs that have improved air quality in U.S. cities, provided economic opportunities and reduced U.S. dependence on foreign oil.  American consumers also recognize the social, environmental and economic value of renewable fuels and are committed to encouraging the development and use of renewable fuels with tax dollars.  
<P>
In a poll conducted following the November 1996 elections by the Republican polling firm, Research/Strategy/Management, Inc., 82 percent of Americans said they prefer directing current federal tax policies to encourage the use of domestically produced renewable fuels. 
<P>
In fact, 71 percent said they support continuing the federal 5.4 cent-per-gallon excise tax exemption for ethanol-blended fuels.  The overwhelming support of U.S. renewable fuels policy varied little among Republicans, Democrats and Independents.    
<P>
<B>Ethanol has played a major part in reducing pollution in the nation's major cities.</B><BR>
The 1996 fiscal year annual report of the Environmental Protection Agency recognized the Reformulated Gasoline Program as a major element in improving the nation's air quality.  The EPA report showed significant reductions in concentrations of toxic air pollutants.  Benzene was reduced approximately 38 percent between 1994 and 1995.  Carbon monoxide fell by 15 percent, and volatile organic compounds were reduced by 15 percent. With results like these, it is clear why three in four Americans say they are willing to continue tax incentives to ethanol blenders. 
<P>
<B>Ethanol production creates American jobs.</B><BR>
The ethanol industry is currently responsible for over 40,000 direct and indirect American jobs, contributing more than $5.6 billion annually to the U.S. economy.  Ethanol production utilizes more than 5 percent of the nation's corn crop.  The corn demand for ethanol production increased corn producers' incomes by more than $1.2 billion--or about 11 percent--in 1994.  
<P>
<CENTER>

<I>"World oil demand will grow by 11 billion<br>
 barrels per day over the next five years, while<br>
 currently producing fields reduce production<br>
 by 8 billion barrels per day."</I>
<hr width=350>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Ethanol industry development reduces our dependence on foreign oil. </B> <br>
Simmons & Co., a Houston-based oil consulting firm, predicts that world oil demand will grow by 11 billion barrels per day over the next five years, while currently producing fields reduce production by 8 billion barrels per day.  
<P>
Meeting this additional 19 billion barrel-per-day demand won't come cheaply.  Already, refiners in the U.S., Europe and Japan that a decade ago produced at 75 percent of maximum capacity,  are being worked at nearly 95 percent capacity.  Wouldn't it be wise for the U.S. to secure its energy needs before a worldwide shortage occurs?  We as citizens need to let our elected representatives know of our commitment to renewable sources for America's energy needs in the 21st century.

<CENTER><B>MEMBERS OF CONGRESS EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO ELIMINATING ETHANOL TAX INCENTIVE</B></CENTER>
<P>
Rep. Bill Archer's (R-TX) stated intention to eliminate the ethanol tax incentive in the 105th Congress has evoked a strong negative reaction on Capitol Hill.  Last week, Rep. Lane Evans (D-IL) circulated a letter signed by 12 key Members of Congress representing 8 different states expressing opposition to Archer's "intention to propose cuts to the federal tax incentive for ethanol."  
<P>
The letter, which was also sent to members of the Transportation Tax Task Force established by Archer, states, "Ethanol has proven to be an important economic investment in domestic renewable energy. It has reduced our nation's dependence on imported energy, created thousands of jobs throughout rural America, reduced air pollution, and increased energy security."
<P>
"At a time when rural America is in need of our help, we believe that cutting the tax incentive would be untimely and detrimental to the U.S. economy. The ethanol tax incentive enjoys strong, bi-partisan support in Congress and is considered essential by American agricultural and financial leaders."

<CENTER><B>REP. ENGLISH INTRODUCES BILL TO ELIMINATE ETHANOL TAX INCENTIVE</B></CENTER>
<P>
As he did during the last Congress, Representative Phil English (R-PA) has again introduced legislation to eliminate the federal ethanol program.  The legislation, H.R. 161, would eliminate all the applicable tax incentives for ethanol-blends, E-85, and ETBE in 1998, two years earlier than currently slated to expire. To date, Rep. Jim McDermott (D-WA) and Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) are co-sponsors of H.R. 161.
<P>
Rep. English has characterized his legislation as eliminating the tax incentive for large ethanol producers only.  In fact, the bill eliminates the tax incentives for all gasoline marketers, regardless of size.  While Rep. English has left in place a small producer tax credit (an income tax credit of 10 cents per gallon), the fact is this tax credit cannot be widely used by any ethanol producer.  
<P>
In order to take advantage of the income tax credit, a producer must have significant income to offset liabilities.  In the highly competitive ethanol production industry, no producer can generate enough tax liability to take advantage of the credit. Moreover, because many of the small producers are owned by farmer cooperatives, they cannot pass the benefit along to their members.  Rep. David Minge (D-MN) sponsored legislation in the 104th Congress to correct the anomalies in the small producer tax credit that prevent it from being utilized by ethanol producers. 
<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<I>Rep. Bill Archer (R-TX), Chairman of the House Ways & Means Committee, has stated his intention to eliminate the ethanol tax incentive in the 105th Congress.  The following article is the first in a series that will address some of the questions he has raised in his effort to undermine political support for the federal ethanol program:</I>
<P>
<B>Who do the tax incentives for ethanol benefit and disadvantage economically?</B>
<P>
The direct beneficiaries of the tax incentives for ethanol use are the oil companies that blend and market ethanol fuels.  In fact, only oil companies are allowed to claim the excise and income tax benefits provided by law.  Specifically, I.R.C. 4081 provides gasoline refiners and marketers selling ethanol-blended gasolines a 5.4 per gallon excise tax benefit (assuming a 10% blend is used, a lesser excise tax exemption is available for lower level blends of ethanol) from the 18.1 excise tax on gasoline.  As an alternative, I.R.C. 40 allows oil companies using ethanol to claim a 54 per gallon income tax credit.  
<P>
The existence of the tax incentive allows refiners and marketers to purchase ethanol for octane or oxygen content at competitive prices.  The tax incentive has been a pro-competitive influence on the nation's transportation fuel markets.  This point is reinforced by the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America in a recent letter to the Senate Finance Committee:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"the federal benefits afforded ethanol-blended fuels have been an important, pro-competitive influence on the nation's gasoline markets.  By enhancing the ability of independent marketers to price-compete with their integrated oil company competitors, this program has increased independent marketers' economic viability and reduced consumers' costs of gasoline."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The indirect beneficiaries of the federal ethanol program are numerous, and include consumers, farmers and, of course, ethanol producers.  
<P>
As noted above, the ethanol incentive benefits  <B>consumers</B> by helping reduce the consumer price of gasoline by providing independent gasoline marketers with octane and oxygenate choices that enable them to price-compete with their major oil company competitors.  As a result, the nation's largest consumer organization in the country, Citizen Action, strongly supports the increased use of ethanol.  According to Ed Rothschild, Energy Director for Citizen Action, 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"The use of ethanol, a domestically-produced, cleaner-burning renewable fuel helps American consumers use less polluting oil and reduces dependence on costly oil imports, which are in part subsidized by huge foreign tax credits."     						
</BLOCKQUOTE>
By creating important additional value-added markets for grain, the ethanol tax incentive also helps farmers.  According to one recent report, the ethanol industry supports 55,000 jobs, creates $7 billion in economic activity including $2.2 billion in increased farm income annually, and generates more than $555 million in net tax revenue for the Federal Treasury each year.  It is for this reason that farm organizations across the country enthusiastically support the federal ethanol program.  
<P>
<CENTER><img src="011697a.gif"></CENTER>	
<P>
As noted in one recent letter to the Congress from national agricultural groups:
<P>
"Perhaps more than anyone, farmers recognize the need for and are committed to balancing the budget and eliminating unnecessary federal spending.  The 1996 Farm Bill clearly reflects that commitment.  But the federal ethanol program is not an example of unnecessary spending.  The tax incentives for ethanol production have helped build this important value-added industry, just as federal incentives have helped support the domestic oil and gas industry.  The ethanol program is sound public policy that deserves to be maintained."
<P>	
Finally, because the ethanol tax incentive allows <B>ethanol producers</B> to successfully market their product, they also benefit from the tax incentive.  The federal ethanol program has built a domestic ethanol industry that today has a capacity of more than 1.5 billion gallons at 52 plants across the country, utilizes more than 600 million bushels of grain, and supports more than <B>55,000 jobs</B>.

<CENTER><B>FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INCREASES E-85 PURCHASES</B></CENTER>
<P>
The General Services Administration (GSA) has agreed to increase its total purchases of E-85 Ford Tauruses to 1,029, up from 702, according to the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition.  
<P>
Under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), a percentage of the federal government's new vehicle purchases must be alternative fueled vehicles (AFV).  The percentages are 33% in 1997, 50% in 1998, and 75% thereafter.  President Clinton signed an Executive Order in December recommitting the federal government to these purchase requirements.
<P>
In order to meet the 1997 requirement, the federal government would need to purchase 11,000 AFVs.  "The 1,029 E-85 vehicles still fall short of the mark.  This is disappointing since state governments are meeting or exceeding the new standards established by the federal government," said LaMoine Smith, Nebraska Corn Board.

<CENTER><B>CHRYSLER UNVEILS ETHANOL-BASED 
FUEL CELL VEHICLE</B></CENTER>
<P>
Chrysler Corporation introduced a fuel-cell vehicle that is capable of reforming ethanol into hydrogen on board the vehicle at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, January 11-20.   The technology to reform ethanol was developed in cooperation with Arthur D. Little, the Illinois Corn Marketing Board, and the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs.
<P>
The fuel-cell vehicles use reformer technology to store fuel-such as ethanol-as a liquid, converting it to hydrogen on an as-needed basis.  It is not feasible to store hydrogen on-board a vehicle as the gas takes up 3,000 times more space than liquid fuel.
<P>
"Fuel cells are twice as efficient as conventional internal combustion engines, cutting fuel costs to consumers in half and decreasing the U.S. reliance on imported energy sources," said Bill Mitchell, Program Manager for the Arthur D. Little hydrogen technology unit.  
<P>
"The fuel cell story is generating excitement nationwide, but people are missing an important part of the story.  This technology was designed to run on ethanol, which means it will run best on a domestically produced fuel," said Illinois Corn Marketing Board Research Committee Chairman John Phipps.

<CENTER><B>1996 ENDS WELL FOR ETHANOL INDUSTRY</B></CENTER>
<P>
1996 ended on a positive note for the ethanol industry with year-end daily production approaching 1995 levels.  According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), ethanol production exceeded 78,000 barrels per day (bb/d) in October and November, and is estimated to exceed 82,000 bb/d in December.  This compares with a 4th quarter average in 1995 of 85,000 bb/d.
<P>
Earlier this year, ethanol production fell to just under 40,000 bb/d, a record low in recent years, as corn prices topped $5/bushel because of historically low stockpiles and high export demand.  At the same time, gasoline prices fell over the summer, greatly reducing octane margins.
<P>
"The ethanol industry has weathered the storm, and the outlook is good for 1997 following a 9.3 billion bushel 1996 corn crop," said Eric Vaughn, President of the Renewable Fuels Association.
<P>
<CENTER>
<img src="010397a.gif">
</CENTER>
<P>
<B><U>Ethanol Production Competitive with Other Oxygenates</U></B><BR>
Rising ethanol production, combined with rising methanol prices and thus reduced domestic MTBE production, has brought the U.S. oxygenate market into competitive balance once again.  At more than 80 M bb/d, ethanol production now represents 82% of domestic MTBE production at merchant facilities.
<P>
However, MTBE imports also continue to rise, taking a larger percentage of the U.S. oxygenate market.  DeWitt & Company estimates that MTBE imports now exceed 61 M bb/d, or approximately 64% of domestic merchant MTBE production.  1996 MTBE imports are expected to exceed 935,000 gallons, only slightly less than total ethanol production for the year.  As noted by Jack Huggins, President of Pekin Energy, during testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee this past fall, such a level of imported MTBE is an additional threat to U.S. energy security and "represents imports for product that could be met with domestic production."

<CENTER><B>AG GROUPS REITERATE SUPPORT FOR ETHANOL</B></CENTER>
<P>
Sending a strong message of support for the federal ethanol program, the nation's leading agricultural organizations joined in writing a letter to each member of the Transportation Tax Task Force reiterating agriculture's support for the ethanol tax incentive.  The Transportation Tax Task Force is an informal task force created by House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX) to review transportation-related taxes in anticipation of the reauthorization of the Highway Trust Fund later this year.  Chairman Archer has stated his intention to eliminate the ethanol tax exemption during the 105th Congress.<P>

<B>"The ethanol program is sound public policy... we<BR>
 hope that you will keep the views of farmers in<BR>
 mind, and preserve this vital domestic energy,<BR>

<HR WIDTH=350>
</CENTER>
<P>
Citing their support for ethanol, the agricultural groups note that "in 1995 alone, more than 560 million bushels of grain were processed into ethanol, increasing farm income by more than $2.2 billion and adding more than $7 billion to the national economy."  Ethanol also "helps to reduce our balance of trade by increasing exports of ethanol coproducts, including corn gluten, and lowering imports of oil and petroleum products."  Ethanol "is also a critical component of cleaner reformulated gasolines that are helping many U.S. cities meet air quality standards."
<P>
The authors note that "perhaps more than anyone, farmers recognize the need for and are committed to balancing the budget and eliminating unnecessary federal spending."
<P>
"The 1996 Farm Bill clearly reflects that commitment."  However, "the federal ethanol program is not an example of unnecessary spending.  The tax incentives for ethanol production have helped to build this important value-added industry, just as federal incentives have helped support the domestic oil and gas industry."  
<P>
The letter concludes, "The ethanol program is sound public policy that deserves to be maintained.  As you begin your review of transportation tax issues, we hope that you will keep the views of farmers in mind, and preserve this vital domestic energy, environmental and agricultural program."

<CENTER><B>EIA RELEASES SECOND SURVEY RESULTS OF AFV INDUSTRY</B></CENTER>
<P>
 More than 385,000 vehicles in the U.S. will be powered by fuels other than gasoline and diesel in 1997, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).  Of these vehicles, 70 percent will operate on propane, 20 percent on natural gas, and the remaining alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) will be alcohol-fueled and electric vehicles.

The EIA estimates that by 1997, alternative and replacement fuels, including oxygenates such as ethanol, will account for 2.7 percent of the fuel used by on-road vehicles (on a gasoline-equivalent gallon basis), up from 1.6 percent in 1992.  Consumption of alternative and replacement fuels is expected to increase about 5 percent from 1995 to 1997, to 4 billion gasoline equivalent gallons.

<CENTER><B>DENVER PROVES OXYFUEL EFFICACY;
CITY REPORTS NO CO EXCEEDANCES IN 1996</B></CENTER>
<P>
For the first time since the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, Denver did not have a single violation of federal air quality standards in 1996.  Denver has a history of exceedingly high carbon monoxide pollution, and with passage of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, was designated a serious carbon monoxide (CO) non-attainment area. 
<P> 
Since the introduction of the mandatory oxygenated fuels program in 1991, Denver has experienced a significant decline in carbon monoxide emissions.  There were two carbon monoxide violations in 1995, one in 1994, and six in 1992, compared with 125 in 1972.  In order to be redesignated by the Environmental Protection Agency as in attainment, Denver must have three consecutive years with no federal air quality standards violations.

<HR WIDTH=350>
</CENTER>
<P>
In light of the effectiveness of oxygenated fuels in reducing CO emissions in Denver, a number of environmental and health related organizations have asked the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission to maintain Denver's oxyfuel program.  
<P>
The American Lung Association, Colorado Public Interest Research Group, Colorado Environmental Coalition, and Coloradans for Clean Air are opposed to the shortening or weakening of Colorado's oxygenated gasoline program.  "We believe that this clean air success story is being used by opponents to threaten the program," said Barbara Charnes, Executive Director of Coloradans for Clean Air.  "Colorado is the fifth fastest growing state in the nation.  We continue to need all the help that oxyfuels provide."  
<P>
According to the organizations, "the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for CO significantly underestimates vehicle miles traveled (VMT).  Any shortening or weakening of the program would be a serious public health concern in light of the underestimated and rapidly increasing VMT.  They note that health researchers have found a consistent link between increasing levels of ambient CO and increasing hospital admissions for congestive heart failure for the elderly.  In Colorado, 134,500 people are at risk for CO pollution.
<P>
"The oxygenated gasoline program is a very cost-effective strategy to reduce carbon monoxide pollution.  Furthermore, as the program provides significant air quality and public health benefits, we should not shorten or weaken the program in light of Colorado's growth and increasing vehicle miles traveled," concluded the statement.
<P>
The effectiveness of oxyfuels in substantially reducing CO concentrations was demonstrated in a comprehensive analysis recently completed by Systems Applications International (SAI).  The study found that when wintertime oxyfuel is used, the corresponding ambient CO concentrations are reduced by approximately 14 percent.

<CENTER><B>EPA CREDITS RFG WITH REDUCING POLLUTION</B></CENTER>
<P>
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) annual report on air quality trends, the nation's air is about 30 percent cleaner today than it was 25 years ago.  According to the National Air Quality and Emissions Trends Report, emissions of the nation's six major pollutants.  
<P>
According to the report, carbon monoxide, ozone, NOx, PM10, sulfur dioxide and lead have decreased by 29 percent over the last 25 years, even though the gross domestic product, total population and vehicle miles traveled rose considerably.  
<P>
Reformulated gasoline (RFG) was credited with a significant decline in the concentration of toxic air pollutants, including ambient benzene levels, which decreased 38 percent from 1994 to 1995.  Carbon monoxide pollution, which is primarily caused by vehicle exhaust, fell 10 percent between 1994 and 1995. "Reformulated gasoline has proven to be the most cost-effective means of reducing harmful levels of air pollutants," said Eric Vaughn, President of the Renewable Fuels Association.

<CENTER><B>FTC FUEL AND VEHICLE LABELING GUIDES AVAILABLE</B></CENTER>
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has prepared two business guides -- Labeling Fuels and Labeling Alternative Fueled Vehicles -- to answer questions about the FTC's Labeling Requirements for Alternative Fuels and Alternative Fueled Vehicles Rule.  The Rule was issued in May, 1995 in compliance with the Energy Policy Act of 1992.
<P>
The Rule applies to manufacturers and retailers of new alternative fueled vehicles, dealers of used alternative fueled vehicles, and certain conversion companies; producers, refiners, distributors and retailers of non-liquid alternative vehicle fuels; and makers of electric vehicle fuel dispensing systems.
<P>
These guides explain the Rule, address commonly asked questions, and include sample labels as well as a copy of the Rule for reference.  Labeling Fuels also explains the provisions of the Automotive Fuel Ratings, Certification and Posting Rule, which deals with liquid automotive fuels (except diesel), including liquid alternative fuels.
<P>
The FTC has also completed a consumer-oriented brochure entitled Consider the Alternatives: Alternative Fueled Vehicles and Alternative Vehicle Fuels.  The brochure explains the labels that consumers see on alternative fuel dispensers and on AFVs.
<P>

<CENTER><B>SURVEY FINDS OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FOR<BR>
RENEWABLE ENERGY</B></CENTER>
<P>
A post-election survey on the environment and energy found that voters overwhelmingly support federal programs to promote the increased production and use of renewable energy generally, and the ethanol tax incentive, specifically.  
<P>
According to the poll released by the Sustainable Energy Coalition, American voters strongly favor federal research funding and tax incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency over fossil fuels and nuclear power.
<P>
The national public opinion survey, "America Speaks Out on Energy:  A Survey of 1996 Post-Election Views," was conducted by the Republican polling firm R/S/M, Inc.  It is the latest in a series of annual surveys on energy and the environment that began in 1988.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>Which Program Should Receive Highest Funding Priority?</B>  
<P>
<IMG SRC="er1296a.gif">
</CENTER>
<P>
For a third year in a row, voters give the highest priority for funding for the U.S. Department of Energy's research budget to renewable energy (34%) and energy efficiency (22%).  Nearly a third of respondents (31%) feel nuclear power is the energy source that should be subject to budget cuts, followed by fossil fuels (21%).
<P>
The Sustainable Energy Coalition is a coalition of more than 40 national environmental, business, government and utility organizations that favor shifting federal energy funding priorities from nuclear power and fossil fuels to renewable energy and energy efficiency.

<CENTER><B>VOTERS SUPPORT CONTINUING ETHANOL TAX INCENTIVE</B></CENTER>
<P>
As part of the Sustainable Energy Coalition post-election survey, voters were asked whether the government should continue the federal tax exemption for ethanol-blended gasoline, and 7 out of 10 (71%) voters responded that they support continuing the ethanol tax incentive.  Only 19.8% of those surveyed oppose the exemption.  
<P>
Party affiliation does not appear to have any impact on the level of support, with 70.1% of Republicans, 72.8% of Democrats, 68% of Independents, and 72.7% of Reform Party members supporting the exemption.  
<P>
"Support for the ethanol tax incentive is both strong and bi-partisan," said Vaughn.  "Voters realize that this is a program which creates jobs and stimulates investment here at home, while reducing our nation's trade deficit and improving the economy."

<CENTER><B>DECLINING PRODUCTION, RISING CONSUMPTION INCREASING RELIANCE ON OIL IMPORTS</B></CENTER> 
<P>
According to the early release of its Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) 1997, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects crude oil production in the U.S. will decline to 5.2 million barrels a day in 2015 as a result of lower projected oil prices.  This compares with the projection of 5.8 million barrels per day in the 1996 AEO.  
<P>
On average, U.S. oil production declines by 1.1 percent a year between 1995 and 2015, consistent with long-term historical trends.  The EIA does not anticipate advances in oil discovery technologies will be sufficient to offset declining resources.
<P>
Average world crude oil prices are projected to be about $21/bbl (95$) in 2015, $5 lower than the $26/bbl projection from 1996.  The EIA notes that lower prices reflect expectations that oil production from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will expand and that technology advances will sustain non-OPEC production. 
<P>
The lower energy prices predicted in the 1997 AEO result in higher total consumption projections for 2015.  In fact, the EIA assumes that increases in light-duty vehicle miles traveled more than offset the increases in vehicle efficiency throughout the projection period.
<P>
<U><B>Oil Import Share to Rise from 44 to 61%</B></U><BR>
Declining production and rising consumption lead to growing reliance on petroleum imports through 2015.  The EIA projects the share of petroleum consumption met by imports to rise from 44% in 1995 (measured in barrels per day) to 61% by 2015.

The U.S. trade deficit soared to $48 bln from July-September, the worst quarter ever, as American exports 
fell for the first time in three years.  Historically, oil imports are the single largest component of the 
U.S. trade deficit.  Domestic ethanol production displaces over 43.5 mln barrels of imported oil per year,

<CENTER><B>RESEARCHERS STRIVE TO INCREASE ETHANOL YIELD FROM CORN</B></CENTER></CENTER>
<P>
<I>The following is excerpted from an article written by Ben Hardin, ARS, that appeared in Agricultural Research, October 1996</I>
<P>
Ethanol to fuel cars early in the 21st century may come from fiber-laden crop residues - instead of feed grains - if a vision of agricultural researchers at Peoria, Illinois, pans out.
<P>
But before that vision is fully realized, science and technology will most likely enable ethanol producers to squeeze a bit more ethanol from corn - the main source at present.
<P>
Through fermentation of starches and sugars found inside the grain, modern ethanol plants now produce 2.5 gallons of ethyl alcohol - ethanol - from each bushel of corn.
<P>
[Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists at the National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research (NCAUR)] have their sights set on making fiber in the grain's outer layer yield nearly 0.3 additional gallons per bushel.
<P>
The wet-milling process involves soaking, or steeping, the corn in water, grinding it, and separating high-protein germ, oil, and fiber from the starchy endosperm that is fermented to produce ethanol.  The current practice is to mix the fiber fraction with fermentation solubles before drying it and forming animal feeds.
<P>
"We estimate that if the fiber were also processed into ethanol, a corn wet-milling facility that produces 100 million gallons of 
ethanol per year could generate an additional $4 to $8 million of annual income," says microbiologist Robert Hespell.
<P>
The research strategy for economically converting fiber to ethanol is three pronged.  
They hope to:
<P>
<li>find better ways to physically and chemically treat the fiber to expedite its conversion to sugars,
<P>
<li>find enzymes that better convert the fiber to sugars, and
<P>
<li>custom engineer suitable microbes to ferment the sugars D-glucose, D-xylose, and L-arabinose.
<P>
At College Station, Texas A&M University, researchers applied a pretreatment called ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX) to corn fiber to unlock its potential for fermentation.  With it, NCAUR scientists found they could convert some 50 to 60 percent of the pretreated fiber's components - cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch - into fermentable sugars called monosaccharides, while converting an additional 20 to 30 percent of the fiber into short sugar polymers.
<P>
In the AFEX process, a slurry of water and corn fiber is mixed with highly pressurized liquid ammonia.  Quickly releasing the pressure splits the fiber's bundles of carbohydrate components that are normally rather inaccessible to chemicals or microbes because they are so tightly glued together by lignin.
<P>
Researchers treated the lignin-freed polymers with mixtures of commercial enzymes.  Some enzymes called amylases and cellulases thoroughly hydrolyzed, or split apart, chains of starch and cellulose into links of simple fermentable sugars such as glucose, each with a backbone of six carbon atoms.  Today's ethanol plants typically use bakers' yeast - Saccharomyces cerevisiae - to produce ethanol only from these 6-carbon sugars called hexoses.
<P>
From the corn hemicellulose, or arabinoxylan, xylanase enzymes clipped off at least 25 percent of the component pentoses or 5-carbon sugars - monosaccharides such as arabinose and xylose.  That success was enough to spur a search for xylanases that might be recruited to enhance ethanol production.
<P>
"If we can find bacteria that produce more active xylanases, this ethanol research might also lead to improving the efficiency with which ruminant livestock such as cattle and sheep digest hemicellulosic crop residues," says Hespell.

<CENTER><B>AGRICULTURAL PERSPECTIVE ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS</B>
<P>
<I>By Steve Wentworth</I></CENTER>
<P>
In the late 1980s and the early 90s, the years when I was involved in the leadership of the National Corn Growers Association, most agriculturists would respond to any challenge from the environmental community with predictable arguments: "Farmers are the original environmentalists." Or "Our children drink this well water," implying that farmers wouldn't intentionally expose their family or factory to pollution.  
<P>
Those statements were fine for starters, but they often failed to convince critics concerned about trace levels of nitrates or pesticides.  To retain society's trust we need to demonstrate and quantify how we are making environmental progress, not just complain that we are misunderstood.
<P>
When I spoke to an audience of 500 consumers and environmentalists recently, I stressed how technology has allowed me - and the rest of American agriculture - to continually improve the relationship between farming and the environment.
<P>
Just compare an 80-acre corn field I cropped in 1974, the year I started farming, to the same field 20 years later.  It is testimony that high yields and environmentally friendly farming can co-exist:
<P>

<li> In 1974 the field across the road from my home produced 11,200 bushels of corn or 140 bushels per acre. [In 1994], the same field yielded 226 bushels per acre or a total production of over 18,000 bushels.  Obviously, good weather plays a role, but it was still a 60% increase.
<P>
<li> I applied 190 lb. of supplemental nitrogen to the corn in 1974.  Twenty years later I raise a bigger crop on 40 lb. less nitrogen, a 20% reduction.  All 150 units of nitrogen came from ammonium sulfate, a byproduct of lysine production at a local corn processing plant, and was recycled on that field.
<CENTER>
<HR WIDTH=350>
While U.S. consumers have increased their<BR> 
reliance on foreign oil since the Arab embargo,<BR>
I have cut my consumption more than 80%.<BR>
<HR WIDTH=350>
</CENTER>
<LI>Back in 1974 it took 113 machinery hours and 865 gal. of fuel to farm that 80 acres.  Through reduced tillage and larger equipment, I was able to plant, raise and harvest the crop with just 23 hours of equipment time and 147 gallons of fuel.  Upshot: While U.S. consumers have increased their reliance on foreign oil since the Arab embargo, I have cut my consumption more than 80%.
<P>
<LI>For weed control in 1974, I applied 8 lb. of herbicides per acre.  By planting a seed corn variety bred to be imazethapyr-tolerant today, I had virtually no weeds while using 4 oz. of Pursuit per acre or only 2.5 gal. on the whole field.
<P>
<LI>Roughly 50% of all Illinois farmland exceeded the tolerable limits for soil loss in 1974.  Now due to the rapid adoption of no-till and conservation tillage, less than 25% exceeds the standard.
<P>
Just a year ago, I and several other farmers helped start a new organization: Foundation EARTH (Environment, Agriculture, Research and Technology in Harmony).  Foundation EARTH recognizes that farmers everywhere place great value on conserving the richness and integrity of the environment in which we farm. 
<P>
Last year we asked farmers to make a Pledge to Earth.  Dozens of producers around the country already are putting those plans in action.  Some are building wildlife habitats, adding filter strips, expanding no-till acreage, and adopting precision farming practices that allow them to apply the most appropriate levels of fertilizers and other inputs.  Our goal is to educate both farmers and consumers on technologies that boost profits yet protect the earth's limited resources.

<CENTER><B>VALUABLE FEED CO-PRODUCT HANDBOOKS NOW AVAILABLE</B></CENTER>
<P>
Chicago, IL -- Reflecting the growing importance
of byproducts to the economic viability of ethanol production,
the domestic ethanol industry and the nation's corn growers have
jointly produced two corn co-product reference handbooks describing
the numerous high quality corn co-products available to the feed
industry.<BR>
<P>
&quot;These handbooks are the most comprehensive
compilation to date of technical data regarding corn co-products,&quot;
said Eric Vaughn, President of the Renewable Fuels Association.
 &quot;They will be an instrumental tool in marketing the 1.4
billion tons of byproducts that are produced each year to livestock
producers.&quot;<BR>
<P>
The guides, <I>&quot;Feed Co-Products of the Corn
Wet Milling Process&quot;</I> and <I>&quot;Feed Co-Products of
the Corn Dry Milling Process,&quot;</I> provide valuable information
for the feeding industry on the nutritional, economic, production
and use value of corn co-products.  Each handbook contains a description
of the manufacturing of ethanol process, nutrient composition,
livestock feeding trials, recommended feeding levels and references.
<BR>
<P>
The processes of producing ethanol for fuel and beverage
alcohol utilize only the starch portion of the grain, leaving
behind high-value, high-protein, high-vitamin content feed products
called distillers dried grains or corn gluten feed.  These feeds
can provide a nourishing supplement to livestock and poultry diets.
 <BR>
<P>
&quot;Co-products from the milling of corn have important
nutritional properties that add value to feeding rations and livestock
programs,&quot; said Jerry Weigel, Director of Nutrition and Regulatory
Affairs at ExSeed Genetics, L.L.C., and chief author of the handbooks.
 &quot;The books will be a valuable resource tool for dairy producers,
cattle feeders, the poultry industry, nutritionists, feed consultants,
veterinarians and feed sales personnel.&quot;<BR>
<P>
&quot;The availability of corn co-products provides
a cost-competitive feed on a per-head basis,&quot; said Lucy Norton,
Domestic Market Development Director of the Iowa Corn Growers
Association.  &quot;Corn co-products compete with other feed ingredients,
helping to reduce overall feed grain costs to the producer.&quot;
