<B>VAXCEL ANNOUNCES LICENSE AGREEMENT
WITH CORIXA<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Atlanta, Georgia, (April 9, 1996)
<BR>
</B>
<P>
Vaxcel, Inc. today announced the
signing of a definitive license agreement with Corixa Corporation
for use of Vaxcel's Optivax&#174; in combination with vaccines
being developed by Corixa.<BR>

<P>
Optivax is Vaxcel's proprietary
vaccine delivery and adjuvant system that is based on synthetic
copolymers. In preclinical studies, Optivax has been shown to
significantly improve the effectiveness of a variety of different
vaccines. In January Vaxcel announced the initiation of a Phase
I human clinical trial to evaluate the safety of Optivax administered
in combination with a  human chorionic gonadotropin based vaccine
in patients with metastatic cancer.<BR>

<P>
Terms of the deal with Corixa were
not disclosed. However, Paul Wilson, president &amp; CEO of Vaxcel,
said Corixa received worldwide, exclusive rights to use Optivax
with a variety of cancer and infectious disease vaccines being
developed by Corixa. Corixa also has the right to sublicense vaccines
containing Optivax. Corixa or its sublicensees will be responsible
for conducting all development, regulatory submissions and marketing
activities for their vaccines combined with Optivax.<BR>

<P>
“We are pleased that Corixa
has licensed Vaxcel's Optivax for a number of vaccines
they are developing,” Mr. Wilson said. “Corixa is an
excellent partner for Vaxcel. This agreement is another example
of our strategic plan to enter into multiple corporate alliances,
each having the potential to generate significant revenue for
Vaxcel.”<BR>

<P>
Corixa, a privately-held Seattle-based
biotechnology company formed in late 1994, is discovering and
developing T cell therapeutic vaccines for the treatment of certain
infectious diseases and cancer. Corixa has two announced corporate
partners, S.B. Biologicals for an infectious disease program and
CellPro, Inc. for the development and marketing of <I>ex vivo</I>
applications of Corixa's cancer technology.<BR>

<P>
Vaxcel is engaged in the development
and commercialization of Optivax and offers field-of-use licenses
to companies developing new vaccines or improving existing ones.
In addition to this license agreement with Corixa, the company
also has option agreements with Connaught Laboratories, Inc. and
Medeva PLC to evaluate and develop human vaccines using Optivax.
Vaxcel is a wholly owned subsidiary of CytRx Corporation (NASDAQ:
CYTR).<BR>

<P>
CytRx Corporation and its subsidiaries
are engaged in the development of pharmaceutical products. In
addition to Vaxcel, CytRx has two other subsidiaries. Vetlife
is developing products to enhance food animal growth and Proceutics
provides high quality preclinical development services to the
pharmaceutical industry.<BR>

<B>Atlanta, Georgia, July 24, 1996</B> <BR>

<P>
CytRx Corporation (NASDAQ: CYTR) today announced a net loss of
$1.1 million ($.15 per share) for the three months ended June
30, 1996 versus a loss of $3.3 million ($.42 per share) reported
in 1995.  For the six months ended June 30, 1996 the company reported
a net loss of $2.5 million ($.31 per share) versus $6.7 million

<P>
Jack J. Luchese, CytRx president and chief executive officer,
commented, “During the second quarter of 1996 CytRx continued
to move forward with development of RheothRx&reg;<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>,
a new, purified form of RheothRx developed by CytRx which removes
impurities previously associated with renal side effects.  Last
month CytRx was awarded a composition of matter patent on this
improved compound which will provide patent protection through
2013.  Recent meetings with the FDA on RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>
were encouraging enough for us to accelerate our development plans
in order to commence advanced human clinical trials by early 1997
to study RheothRx<I><SUB>pf  </SUB></I>as a treatment for the
acute crisis of sickle cell disease.”<BR>

<P>
CytRx Corporation and its subsidiaries are engaged in the development
of pharmaceutical products.  CytRx Therapeutics is developing
RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I> for the treatment of acute sickle
cell crisis and other vascular diseases.  CytRx's Vaxcel subsidiary
is developing the Optivax vaccine delivery system. Vetlife is
developing products to enhance food animal growth.  Proceutics
provides high quality preclinical development services to the
pharmaceutical industry.<BR>

1996 NINE MONTH RESULTS
</FONT></B>
<P>

<B>Atlanta, Georgia, October 23,
1996<BR>
</B>
<P>
CytRx Corporation (NASDAQ: CYTR)
today announced a net loss of $1.1 million ($.15 per share) for
the three months ended September 30, 1996 versus a loss of $2.0
million ($.25 per share) reported in 1995.  For the nine months
ended September 30, 1996 the company's net loss was $3.6 million
($.46 per share) versus $8.7 million ($1.10 per share) in 1995.
 As of September 30, 1996 CytRx had consolidated cash and short-term
investments of $19.4 million.

<P>
“We continue to make solid progress,”
commented Jack J. Luchese, CytRx president and chief executive
officer. “We are moving ahead with plans to begin an advanced
human clinical trial to study RheothRx&reg;<I><SUB>pf,</SUB></I>
in early 1997.  This trial will be focused on confirming positive
results previously seen in patients suffering from the acute crisis
of sickle cell disease.”

<P>
Luchese added, “Also, our Vetlife
subsidiary recently became the exclusive U.S. supplier of Compudose
cattle growth promotant products for Eli Lilly's Elanco Animal
Health division.  This establishes Vetlife's presence in the beef
productivity market.  On January 1, 1997, Vetlife will become
the exclusive distributor for the new line of Component brand
cattle growth implants, manufactured by Ivy Laboratories, Inc.”


<P>
CytRx was actively purchasing its
own stock during the third quarter.  The company has now repurchased
approximately 351,000 shares which represents 4.4% of previously
outstanding shares.  Noted Luchese, “We feel CytRx stock
is a bargain at current levels, and we are taking advantage of
this opportunity.”

<P>
CytRx's mission is to develop and
commercialize high value human therapeutics while capitalizing
on other opportunities through its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
 CytRx's RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I> is being developed to treat

<B>CYTRX TO MERGE ZYNAXIS WITH VAXCEL SUBSIDIARY TO CREATE PUBLIC
COMPANY WITH MULTIPLE VACCINE DELIVERY TECHNOLOGIES <BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Atlanta, Georgia and Malvern Pennsylvania, December 6, 1996
<BR>
</B>
<P>
CytRx Corporation [NASDAQ:CYTR] and Zynaxis Inc. [NASDAQ:ZNXS]
today announced they have agreed, subject to Zynaxis shareholder
approval,  to merge Zynaxis with CytRx's Vaxcel, Inc. subsidiary
to create a new public company with multiple novel vaccine delivery
opportunities.  Paul J. Wilson, Vaxcel's current President and
CEO, will head the “new” Vaxcel which will be headquartered
in Atlanta.  Before closing, which is expected by the end of the
first quarter of 1997, CytRx will provide secured interim financing
of up to $2 million to Zynaxis, subject to certain conditions.
 After closing, Vaxcel shares are expected to publicly trade on
the NASDAQ SmallCap market.  CytRx will own approximately 87%
of Vaxcel's outstanding shares.  

<P>
<B><U>New Company will Benefit both CytRx and Zynaxis</U>
</B>
<P>
“This merger is significant for both Zynaxis and Vaxcel,”
commented Jack J. Luchese, CytRx President and Chief Executive
Officer.  “It is a win-win situation, as we are establishing
a company with greater capabilities than either company alone.
 Furthermore, the Vaxcel/Zynaxis combination is a successful example
of CytRx's strategy to create wholly-owned subsidiaries around
distinct technology platforms, develop value in them, and then
take each public.  We believe this publicly traded company will
provide equity market recognition of the value in CytRx subsidiaries.”


<P>
 “This is also an ideal opportunity for Zynaxis,” added
Martyn Greenacre, Chairman and CEO of Zynaxis.  “Vaxcel specializes
in human vaccine delivery technologies.  I am confident this will
maximize the potential of our complementary technologies.”


<P>
<U><B>Technologies Address Injectable, Oral, and Mucosal Delivery
of Vaccines<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
“The addition of Zynaxis technologies will round out Vaxcel's
portfolio of proprietary vaccine delivery technologies to provide
multiple opportunities for success,” noted Paul Wilson. 
“Our Optivax&reg; adjuvant is primarily focused on enhancing
the effectiveness of injectable vaccines, while the Zynaxis technologies
are primarily targeted on improving oral and mucosal vaccine delivery.
Our strategy will be to license these three technologies on a
vaccine-by-vaccine basis to companies engaged in vaccine research
and development.”

<P>
Preclinical studies using Optivax with a variety of vaccines have
demonstrated that Optivax represents a more effective way of administering
injectable vaccines.  A Phase I human clinical trial was initiated
in January 1996 to evaluate the human safety and adjuvant activity
of Optivax administered in combination with an immunotherapeutic
vaccine for patients with metastatic cancer.  Results are expected
in early 1997.

<P>
Zynaxis' PLG microspheres are a proprietary microencapsulation
technology designed to  allow for delivery of oral vaccines. In
preclinical studies, PLG encapsulated vaccines have reproducibly
induced systemic and mucosal antibody responses following oral
administration.  ALK, a world leader in allergy therapeutics,
has licensed the PLG technology for oral delivery of allergy vaccines.
 They are currently conducting a Phase II human clinical trial
in Europe.

<P>
Zynaxis' mucoadhesive polymer offers potential for oral delivery
as vaccines can be formulated with these compounds and delivered
to mucosal sites. A recent preclinical study showed the polymer
induced a stronger mucosal immune response following a single
<U>oral</U> dose of an influenza virus vaccine than the injected
vaccine. 

<P>
As part of the agreement, Zynaxis is seeking a buyer for its Cauldron
Process Chemistry division with closing expected in 1997.  Cauldron,
located in Malvern, Pennsylvania, provides process research and
development and production of bulk pharmaceutical chemicals under
Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) conditions. 

<P>
QED  Technologies of Malvern, Pa. provided advisory services to
CytRx in this transaction.

<P>
CytRx Corporation's business strategy is to build shareholder
value through the development and commercialization of high value
human therapeutic products, while capitalizing on other bio-pharmaceutical
opportunities through its unique subsidiary structure.  

<P>
Zynaxis' technology portfolio includes proprietary oral and mucosal
delivery systems to enhance the performance of vaccines.<BR>

<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Certain statements, expectations and assumptions
contained in this release are forward-looking and are subject
to a number of risks and uncertainties.  Although CytRx and Zynaxis
have used their best efforts to be accurate in making those forward-looking
statements, it is possible that the assumptions made by management
may not materialize.  In addition, other important factors which
could materially affect future performance include: economic conditions
in the vaccine industries; outcomes of current and future clinical
trials; successful licensing of the technologies to vaccine development
companies; reviews by the SEC, FDA and other regulatory agencies;
and the risk factors set forth from time to time in CytRx and
Zynaxis SEC filings, copies of which are available upon request
from each company.

<TD WIDTH=582>Vaccines are medicines designed to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases by stimulating the 
body's natural defenses -- the immune system.

<P>
Vaccines have contributed more to disease eradication than any other medical intervention.  Some of the most devastating
 human diseases such as polio, smallpox, tetanus, pertussis and measles have been significantly controlled by safe and 
effective vaccines.  

<P>
More recently, vaccines have been introduced to prevent hepatitis, bacterial meningitis and chickenpox.
<P>
<BR>
<P>
The global vaccine market is estimated at over $2 billion with sales expected to continue to grow at double-digit rates since 
vaccines are considered to be one of the most cost-effective medical tools.  

<P>
Many new vaccines are expected to be commercialized over the next decade including vaccines that hold promise in dealing 
with the growing problem of antibiotic resistance.
<P>
<BR>
<P>
Many current vaccines require multiple doses -- and physician visits -- to adequately protect individuals against disease.  
This is a costly procedure that often leads to noncompliance. There is considerable opportunity in reducing the number of 
required doses.

<P>
Also, some current vaccines are only marginally effective with patients contracting the disease even though they were 
properly immunized.  Increasing effectiveness of these vaccines to improve patient response rates offers significant benefit.

<P>
“Subunit vaccines” offer a promising approach to new vaccine development.  However many new subunit 
vaccine candidates lack the efficacy required for FDA approval.  These companies cannot succeed without enhancing 
the effectiveness of subunit vaccines.

<P>
Oral immunization has numerous advantages over injectable vaccines including ease of administration and patient 
acceptability.  New delivery vehicles will be necessary to successfully develop these oral vaccines.

a unique, patented surfactant copolymer that significantly reduces
blood viscosity and inhibits platelet adhesion. In a Phase II
clinical trial, RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I> showed statistically

as each year there are approximately 100,000 hospital admissions
for acute sickle cell crisis as well as a large number of patients
who suffer at home. Reducing the duration and severity of crisis
could provide significant health benefits as over time, organ
systems deteriorate due to damage caused by each sickle cell crisis.

Optivax: </FONT></B></TD>
   <TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Optivax&reg;
is a family of proprietary compounds that improves the effectiveness
of both currently available vaccines and vaccines under development.
Vaxcel and its collaborators have conducted numerous preclinical
studies using Optivax with a variety of different vaccines. These
studies have shown that Optivax represents a more effective method
of administering vaccines.</FONT> </TD>
<TR>
  <TD VALIGN=top><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What are<BR>
 Vaccines:  </FONT></B></TD>
   <TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Vaccines
are medicines designed to prevent the occurrence of infectious
diseases by stimulating the body's natural defenses, the immune
system. Vaccines may have contributed more to disease eradication
than any other medical intervention, as some of the most devastating
human diseases, such as polio, smallpox, tetanus, pertussis, measles,
etc., have been significantly controlled by safe and effective
vaccines. More recently, vaccines to prevent hepatitis, bacterial
meningitis, and chickenpox have been commercialized and are being
widely administered.<BR>

   <TD VALIGN=top><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Need for <BR>
 Optivax: </FONT></B></TD>
   <TD>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There
are four (4) distinct medical needs for Optivax:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">i) many currently marketed vaccines
require multiple doses and several visits to a physician or medical
center to adequately protect individuals against disease. This
is a complex and costly procedure that often leads to noncompliance
by individuals. Therefore, considerable reward would be gained
by reducing the number of required injections with Optivax.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ii) some currently marketed vaccines
are only marginally effective, and consequently, patients contract
disease even though they are properly immunized. Vaxcel believes
Optivax can increase the effectiveness of marginally effective
vaccines, thereby improving patient response rates.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> iii) a promising approach to new
vaccine development is the area of subunit vaccines. While promising,
many new subunit vaccine candidates are poorly immunogenic and
therefore lack the efficacy required for FDA approval.  Vaxcel
believes Optivax will enhance the effectiveness of subunit vaccines,
thereby providing the required efficacy for approval and ultimate
commercialization.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> iv) oral immunization has numerous
advantages over injectable vaccines, including patient acceptability,
ease of administration, and induction of mucosal immunity. Vaxcel
believes its oral vaccine delivery technology is promising and
the commercial value of this technology is high.</FONT></TD>
<TR>
   <TD VALIGN=top><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Actions of <BR>
Optivax: </FONT></B></TD>
   <TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Optivax
is based on the ability of certain copolymers to augment or modify
the immune response to vaccines. The copolymers are combined with
an antigen, and in some instances other active ingredients, to
form a final vaccine formulation. Optivax acts both as a delivery
system by targeting vaccines to cells of the immune system and
as a classical vaccine adjuvant because of its ability to augment
the immune system's response to vaccines.<BR>
</FONT></TD>
<TR>
   <TD VALIGN=top><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Status: </FONT></B></TD>
   <TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Vaxcel
is currently collaborating with pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies to evaluate Optivax with their human vaccines. In addition,
Vaxcel recently completed a definitive license agreement for Optivax
with Corixa Corporation and also has option agreements with Connaught,
Inc. and Medeva PLC to evaluate and develop human vaccines using
Optivax.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> In January 1996, a Phase I trial
was initiated at a comprehensive cancer center to evaluate the
human safety of Optivax administered in combination with a beta
human chorionic gonadotropin based vaccine in patients with metastatic
cancer.<BR>

<TR>
   <TD VALIGN=top><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Vaxcel <BR>
Strategy:</FONT></B></TD>
   <TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Vaxcel
plans to aggressively license Optivax to numerous pharmaceutical
and biotechnology companies that are engaged in vaccine research
and development. These companies will combine Optivax with their
vaccines and assume responsibility for product development, regulatory
approval, and marketing - all at their expense. In return, Vaxcel
will receive upfront licensing fees, milestone payments, and royalties
on sales.<BR>

to industry sources, the global vaccine market is estimated at
over $2 billion. Sales of vaccines are expected to grow in the
future at double digit annual rates because: (i) many new vaccines
are expected to be commercialized within the next decade; (ii)
vaccines are one of the most cost-effective medical tools, an
important consideration given global efforts to control health
care costs; and (iii) vaccines are a promising medical alternative

<h1> Civil and Mining Engineering Foundation</h1>
The Postgraduate Civil Engineering Foundation was established in February 1968, as a development of the already existing links between the Department of Civil Engineering and industry and following the pattern of the early University foundations. The name was changed to the Civil and Mining Engineering Foundation in 1986 following amalgamation of the corresponding departments.<P>
The Foundation actively fosters collaboration between the Civil and Mining Engineering School and the engineering profession and industry. It does so in several important ways:
<ul>
<li> by promoting engineering consultation, research, training, public lectures, special short courses and technical reporting,
<li>by providing direction to undergraduate and post-graduate educational programs,
<li>by sponsoring research projects in the School and encouraging research links with industry,
<li>by serving as a focus for the exchange of local and overseas expertise,
<li>by forming working committees of top engineers from government, consulting practices, the civil and mining industry and the University to study topical issues arising in the engineering profession, and
<li>by reporting the important results of all these activities to members and the public through reports and engineering publications.
</ul>
The Foundation is supported by annual subscriptions from its governors, members and by special donors.

<H1>The Ocean Technology Group</H1>
<BODY>
<h2>
Ocean Technology at Sydney
</h2>
Ocean engineering is a branch of technology based on a combination of
the fields of oceanography and classical areas of engineering.
Geotechnics play an important role, as do corrosion engineering and
robotics.  The Group is concentrating on these new areas as its initial
supplement to the on-going activities in the Engineering Faculty.  The
Ocean Technology Group is affiliated with the Marine Studies Centre of
the University of Sydney.  This Centre is the leading research group in
Australia for studies of the marine environment.
<h3>
Ocean Wave Predictions
</h3>
Ocean waves often provide the critical loading in offshore engineering
- vessel slamming, sediment resuspension and offshore platform
stability are examples.  To date wave forecasts were made from poorly
known initial conditions, but with the advent of satellite wave
measurements, this can all change.  Also, ocean wave statistics are
important in offshore design considerations and by archiving past and
future satellite wave measurements, many site surveys will be able to
be made more economically.  There is export potential for Australian
engineering consultants here.
<h3>
Satellite Measurement Technologies
</h3>
As well as sensing ocean waves, satellites can be used to measure
positions at sea and sea surface elevation.  Accurate weather
forecasting, including advance warnings of storms, is just one of the
potential benefits of this new ocean technology, which seeks to use the
latest remote sensing radar in the provision of ocean waves statistics
and forecasts.  The potential has been recognised by the I R & D Board
by their support of the development of a new technology in Australia
for the detection of ocean waves - the "Waves from Space" project.
<p>
A satellite (ERS-1) carrying high resolution radar equipment known as a
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), was launched in July 1991 by the
European Space Agency.  For the first time a very detailed picture of
the sea surface area can be obtained, because this radar system can
distinguish ocean waves over resolutions of 25m x 25m.  Previously,
wave data collected by satellite altimeters only gave information on
the height of ocean waves.  According to the Ocean Technology Group,
"We will now be able to distinguish not just the height but also the
direction of the propagating waves and therefore the position of
distant storms that generated them.  This additional information can be
used to correct weather forecasts all around Australia.  In the past,
these forecasts were based on computer models and reports from a few
ships scattered over a large expanse of ocean."
<h3>
Greenhouse Gas Mitigation
</h3>
Schemes to reduce the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide are
being investigated.  Ian Jones, an investigator on this project says:
"Our work can put Australia at the forefront of this technology
internationally.  Six per cent of our Gross Domestic Product comes from
marine industries, and with our long coastline and reliance on
container ships for exports, we are more dependent upon the ocean than
many other nations.  Federal support for developments in ocean
technology makes sense."
<p>
A Japanese SAR satellite, JERS-1, was also successfully launched in
February 1992, and the Ocean Technology Group is currently working
with the Japanese space reception centre NASDA on data acquisition
verification programmes.
<h3>
Environmental Loading on Offshore Structures
</h3>
Ian Jones has been making measurements for many years from ESSO/BHP
platforms in Bass Strait in relation to engineering of environmental
loading on platforms.  The Ocean Technology Group has both graduates
and undergraduates working on problems associated with construction of
off-shore platforms.  These include studies of the windflow around such
structures and the nature of the marine atmospheric boundary layer.  
<p>
Our knowledge of wind and current fields in the coastal ocean is being
applied to develop high technology products that will bring import
dollars to Australia.
<h3>
Underwater Robotics
</h3>
The group has constructed a number of computer controlled underwater
devices.  Currently we are taking part in generic technology production
to develop in Australia an acoustic vision system to allow engineers to
inspect underwater structures in the turbid water of harbours and our
northern waters.
<h3>
International Co-operation
</h3>
Graduates of the University of Sydney program are currently studying or
researching at North American Universities.  A number of students
attend international conferences and undertake part of their degree at
foreign centres of excellence.
<h3>
Careers and Education
</h3>
In a report on ocean engineering prepared a few years ago by Jon
Hinwood for the Institution of Engineers, Australia, it was suggested
that the country needed 75 off-shore engineers annually.  The Ocean
Technology Group hopes to satisfy some of this need by providing some
additional marine orientated courses in fluid mechanics, satellite
sensing of the oceans, and wave and environmental loading on offshore
stuctures.  These, together with an active programme of thesis research
projects, will go some way to providing people trained to contribute to
our future ocean activities.

<BODY>
<h1>Chancellor's Industry Scholarships in Engineering (CISE)</h1>
Chancellor's Scholarships in Engineering are open to final year high
school students who expect to achieve a TER of at least 96.00 in the
HSC or interstate equivalent. They are highly competitive and many
applications are received each year for the limited number of places
available.
<P>
The Scholarships are worth $10250 in 1995. This is paid in fortnightly
instalments for the four years' duration of the normal undergraduate
course, subject to continued satisfactory academic performance.<P>
Chancellor's Scholars attend site visits to the sponsoring companies
as well as functions at the University designed to promote good
relations and personal interaction between the students and the
organisations supporting the CISE program.
<P>
During the long vacations between first, second and third year, each
Scholar is allotted to a sponsoring organisation for industrial
education placement (IEP). Unlike other engineering undergraduates who
have only one industrial placement during their time at the University,
Chancellor's Scholars have the opportunity to gain experience working
in various aspects of industry. Every Scholar works for three different
companies and every sponsor sees three different students over the four
years of the undergraduate course.
<P>
Most scholars expect to, and do join one of the sponsors on
graduation, but there is no formal obligation either way.
<P>
The CISE Program is controlled by a Steering Committee and administered
by the Faculty of Engineering.

<TITLE>Australian Graduate School of Engineering Innovation (AGSEI)</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<h1>Australian Graduate School of Engineering Innovation (AGSEI)</h1>
<b>AGSEI</b> is a national Advanced Engineering Centre promoting an
engineering culture which brings together technology, management and
marketing, with an overall focus on wealth creation and the
introduction of a more effective process of engineering innovation to
Australian industry.  AGSEI has been formed jointly by the Engineering
Faculties of the University of Sydney and the University of Technology,
Sydney, and is
<A HREF=atpmap>located</A> separately from both of them. Its objectives
are:
<ul>
<li>to ensure that today's engineers, as well as those of tomorrow, are
better equipped to take leadership roles in assuring the success of
industrial enterprises;
<li>to educate engineers and others to think and contribute across
disciplines in a corporate environment;
<li>to demonstrate the central role of innovation in achieving
competitive advantage;
<li>to provide industry with convenient access to national and
international best practice in engineering management and the
application of technology;
<li>to enhance the capability to commercialise new technology and the
results of research and development;
<li>to foster the creation of new industry through technology transfer
and the introduction of appropriate management systems;
<li>to raise understanding in the professions and society of the role
of industry, technology and engineering in the creation of national wealth;
<li>to educate engineers to understand and contribute to enterprise
management, and to educate executive managements to understand and
utilise their engineering capability more effectively.
</ul>
<h4>Students</h4>
Initially programs are being structured for engineers and other
professionals who have been in industry for two to three years after
completing their bachelors degree. Later programs will be developed for
undergraduate courses.
<h4>The programs</h4>
AGSEI offers an array of courses centring on:
<ul>
<li>Engineering Management
<li>Engineering Innovation
<li>Industrial Systems Engineering
</ul>
The programs cover topics in:
<ul>
<li>quality
<li>innovation
<li>technology
<li>systems engineering
<li>information technology and management
<li>computer-aided engineering and logistic support
<li>human resources and change management
<li>professional and business ethics
<li>design and documentation
<li>manufacturing
<li>government
<li>economics
<li>marketing
<li>finance
<li>law
</ul>
The approach taken is distinctly different from that of an MBA. The MBA
programs teach generic management, regardless of what is being managed.
AGSEI builds specifically on the capability of <i>engineers</i>, and is
wholly about organisation and application of engineering effort to
innovation and business performance - <i> total engineering</i>, not
total management.
<h4>Modules</h4>
The basic program element is the module, typically offered over one
week and involving intensive material presentation plus workshop and
project sessions. Modules may be aggregated, by those who wish
to do so, to lead to formal awards at several levels such as graduate
certificate or masters degree. Modules will have the following
characteristics:
<ul>
<li>All modules will be available in stand-alone form, designed
expressly to meet the needs of engineers and engineering enterprises.
<li>All programs require the course content to be trialled in industry,
with advice from AGSEI staff, and (where possible) the results to be
reported and discussed in workshop sessions.
<li>Heavy use is made of industry-based project work.
<li>Wherever possible, modules involve group interaction, normally
multi-disciplinary. AGSEI acts not only as a teaching and advisory
resource but as a framework in which participants (engineers and other
professionals who deal with engineers) learn from each other and from
inter-organisation contacts.
</ul>

Manager, AGSEI.</b><P>

Colour images from a greyscale camera
</TITLE>
</HEADER>
<BODY>
<H1>Colour from Greyscale</H1>
I bought myself a Connectix QuickCam at the start of 1995. For those
who don't know them, they are a 320x240 4 bit greyscale camera. They
come with software to run them on a Macintosh. Using this software,
you can take grey scale still photos, or produce Quicktime movies.
<P>
With a little extra ingenuity, you can also use your quickcam to make
full colour images. These are some I've done:
<P>
<IMG SRC=cokenmilk>
<P>
This was my first really successful attempt at creating a colour image.
It was created using the program that first got me going
with this game. It's a little thing called cambot, which came on a
CD that I got for registering my camera. Basically, it's got three
buttons, red green and blue, which you click while holding
a filter of that colour in front of the lens of the camera.
<P>
Sadly, this method limited me to the small window size shown, so I
felt the need to branch out. I've now started capturing 320x240 images
direct from the camera, and then combining them over on a Unix machine.
This gives me results like these:
<P>
<A HREF=lab.colour><IMG SRC=lab.colour.jpg></A>
<A HREF=desk><IMG SRC=window.gif></A>
<P>
I'm still working on getting realistic colour balance in the images, but
these at least have fairly good white point.
<P>
<h2>In case you're interested,</h2> the filters I'm using at the moment are made
from cellophane, bought for $1 a sheet from the local newsagent. In order
to get reasonable colour balance, I'm using 1 layer of red to 2 green and
4 blue. <I>Sigh</I>, why isn't cellophane made in standard filter densities? :)
<P>
I'm combining the images using xv on a unix workstation. Basically, I'm
first applying a gamma correction to the greyscale images, then colourising
them to have the white be a fully saturated red, green or blue (whichever).
Then using the pad function to combine two images at 50% each, and then
combining that image with the third at 33%. That leaves me with an RGB image,
with 24 bits per pixel, with the actual image data in the least
significant 4 bits of
each byte (due to the way pad works). Needless to say, this makes for
rather dark images, so I then increase the brightness to compensate, and fiddle
with the colour balance if I really feel I need to.
<P>
There are noticable colour artifacts in both of these images.  The
yellowy patches in the top image are from the bad blue filter in my first
filter set. The four layers are all loose and wrinkled , and so
transmission is patchy due to reflection.
The magenta blotch in the bottom left corner of the window shot is due to there
being a little bit of masking tape in the bottom corner of the green filter
in my new filter set. Overall, the new set gives better image definition,
so I think I'll stick with it, and I'll just have to be a little more careful.
I'm also on the lookout for a denser blue cellophane. Maybe I should try my
incandescent light photographic filter?
<P>
<A HREF=http://honeybee.biz.usyd.edu.au/www/james/colourCAM/>James</A>
is doing the same thing with some bits of my cellophane, and Adobe Photoshop.
(James has more fun software than me :( ).
<P>
My next plan is to write some software to automate some of this combination,
and also to allow me to interleave four images to make one 640x480 image. Then
we'll really be cooking with gas! (I know this doesn't actually make any
sense from a signal processing standpoint, but I suspect it will produce
reasonable images anyway).

<H2><CENTER>Diet Pills -- the Good, the Bad, the Deadly?<HR></CENTER>
</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size = 4>A new treatment has recently appeared which showed
great promise in resolving a medical condition which afflicts millions,
in some cases producing life-threatening complications, and almost always
drastically altering quality of life.  And, as with so many other groundbreaking 
treatments, the promise has faded to a more evenly, and less exciting, distribution 
of effects that range from significant benefit with minimal side effects for a few
to maximal
side effects (death?) for the smallest proportion. The far majority of recipients
find initial success only to face eventual waning benefits and intolerable
consequences.<BR>
<BR>
This evolution from panacea to panic has taken considerable time to form
and has not yet fully developed. A combination of two prescription medications,
phentermine (trade names include Adipex, Ionamin, and Fastin) and fenfluramine
(available only as Pondimin) were combined in a study by Dr. Michael Weintraub,
now with the FDA. The study received much attention in the medical and lay
press since participants were followed for nearly four years, the study
was well designed (neither patients nor physicians knew who was getting
medication or placebo and the two groups were switched), and the weight
decrease was greater than had been reported through other means.<BR>
<BR>
Two aspects of the study escaped the attention of most readers and have
since become prophetic. One was the high &quot;dropout rate&quot; or number
of people who discontinued the program for whatever reason, including
side effects; second was the eventual weight regain following discontinuation
of medication. Together, these reality measures have led physicians and
their patients to the conclusion that these medications are not for everyone
and that those experiencing relative success may need to continue to take
the medications &quot;forever.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Were the medications to give people better control of their weight with
minimal side effects and at a reasonable cost, an argument could be made
for continuing them life-long much as an insulin-dependent diabetic must
continue medications &quot;forever.&quot; But now that people have had adequate
time to fairly evaluate long term effects, the flag-waving days have gone.<BR>
<BR>
Phentermine alone has never been very useful since most become tolerant
to its effects within weeks to months, meaning that it no longer seems to
work in suppressing appetite. It stands to reason that adding fenfluramine
to it would be unlikely to increase the active lifespan by much.  Even in Weintraub's
study, which incorporated regular exercise and a rational diet, people had
difficulty in dropping more than 35 lbs., resulting in an average
weight of 190-some lbs. at the end of the study.<BR>
<BR>
Two new developments, certain to muddy the waters, have been announced in
recent weeks. One is the release of a fenfluramine alternative, dex-fenfluramine
or Redux, which has been available in Europe for many years. It is hoped
that the new kid on the block will produce fewer neurologic (brain-related)
side effects than its cousin. Second was the untimely release of news reports
out of England (carried in France, Scotland, and... believe it... Singapore)
that a dozen deaths have been
documented in people taking some combination of the above three medications.<BR>
<BR>
Little else has been made public as of this writing. In many countries,
the medications are available without a prescription. Cause of death has
not been reported. In a best case scenario, the 12 deaths may be mere statistical coincidences
and the medications may come clean in the end. Even if the risk were 1 in
10 million, some one is no longer among the living as a result. To that
one, their risk of death was 100%.<BR>
<BR>
The question remains whether they are cost-effective over time. The &quot;new
and improved&quot; version, dex-fenfluramine, is more appropriately titled
&quot;new
and more expensive&quot; at $75 per week. For that amount of money, people
can
expect to shed an average of only 10% of their weight and gain it back as
soon as it is discontinued.<BR>
<BR>
Still, there is hope for the overweight. Treatment programs with a strong
behavioral component have helped people remain within 10 lbs. of their
lowest weight (in some cases hundreds of pounds below their lifetime max.)
for over five years as long as they continue to stay with the program. Such
a program, combined with conservative though rational and carefully
monitored use of medications, will continue to offer the greatest weight
loss results, with the lowest rate of adverse consequences, and the highest
rate of satisfaction. That may not sound as appealing as popping a pill
daily but, for now, comes closest to a &quot;cure.&quot; </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<Blockquote><font size=4>

<P>In a press release issued on  May 29, 1996, Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) called upon the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for tighter regulation of the "weight-loss" industry.  CSPI in cooperation with other health organizations, and consumer advocate groups petitioned the FTC to step up its regulation of the industry.  </P>

<P>Some of the market's largest commercial weight loss programs fail to tell potential customers about the full costs of their services, and fail to provide information about how well - or poorly - they work, according to a leading non-profit health advocacy group.</P> 

<P>The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) examined the nation's largest weight loss programs and found some require clients to purchase excessively priced foods, others distort the cost of mandatory fees, and none routinely disclose data on how much weight their clients actually lose or keep off.</P>

<P>In 1995, 7.5 million Americans spent more than $1.78 billion at commercial weight-loss centers.</P>

<Font size=5><center><B>The Daily Calories An Average Woman
Requires</font></B></center>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=4> Until recently these were called "jumbo muffins", but now they are
simply "muffins." A single sandwich in some fast food joints can contain over
1,000 calories; accompanying fries, soft drink and the obligatory dessert can
nearly provide an adult's daily calorie requirement. <p>

Lisa Young was so aghast at
this elephantiasis of American cuisine that she is making it the subject of her
doctoral thesis at New York University. "People don't need forks, they need
shovels," she says, remarking on pasta bowls that "look like bathtubs" and
Bloody Mary glasses that hold a pint. "Europeans," she says, "are a lot more
quality conscious than they are here. Americans just want value for their
money," and base value on size. The result is that foods that are generally
considered healthy actually become terribly bad. "Pasta in Italy doesn't make
you fat, but in America it does," she says. 

<p>According to Jonathan Parry, design
director at Homer Laughlin China Company, the largest maker of restaurant
dinnerware in the United States, demand for big plates and big bowls has
ballooned since 1992. "Pasta bowls are really big, in popularity and in size.
Some hold 40 ounces." That's two and a half pounds. And are those bowls being
filled? Yes, and then some. The Cheesecake Factory, a chain known for its pasta
and dessert dishes, heaps food practically a foot high on its plates and
 proudly serves up a 12 oz burger. As for the cheesecake, each slice has about 700
calories. It claims it tried to serve lower-calorie slices but nobody wanted
them. 

<p>American steak sizes have long amazed foreign visitors. While dieticians
recommend one serving of meat a day of perhaps 3 1/2 oz, it is not unusual to
find American restaurants serving 16 oz slabs of artery-choking, gut-busting
meat. As one aghast Swede put it to an American health magazine, "A humongous
steak served to one person in an American restaurant would feed a family of four
in Sweden." A Macho Meal at the popular Del Taco Mexican fast-food chain weighs
almost four pounds, with a pound-and-a-quarter of that coming from a single
burrito. 

<p>A case study on the explosion in the American food portion is Nestle's
Butterfinger candy bar. Its original size, nearly 2 1/2 oz and 280 calories, was
already three times the size of a similar popular European chocolate bar, the
Ballisto. Yet a recent addition to the Butterfinger family called the
"supersize" came in at a hefty 4 oz and 510 calories. This bar is so big that
Time magazine chose it to illustrate the unhealthy trend of growing portion
sizes. Unabashed, Nestle has now created an even larger bar size, aptly named
"The Beast". It is an amazing 5 oz of mostly fat and sugar and contains almost a
third of a day's calories, 680. They are so big you could club somebody to death
with one. (In an ominous move, "supersized" candy bars from Nestle and Cadbury
have recently arrived in the UK.)

<p>In some parts of the United States McDonald's
sells a Double Big Mac that contains an amazing four beef patties. Sizzler
restaurants offer Australian Chicken, comprising half a chicken which is baked,
then deep-fat fried. Deny's serves a Super Slam breakfast with three eggs, three
pancakes, three sausage links and three strips of bacon. It is enough breakfast
for three persons, but is generally consumed by just one. 

<p>Just as the French
will adopt foreign dishes while making sure to give them French-accented names,
Americans readily adopt foreign desserts but turn them out in supersize
packages. An Italian ice in Italy comes close to the top of the small cup it
comes in. An Italian ice bought in Miami's trendy Coconut Grove is stacked so
high beyond the brim that only rapid consumption can prevent its contents from
falling over.

<p> Drink sizes are going up. Twenty-five years ago the size of a
soft-drink bottle dispensed by machines in both Europe and the United States was
generally about 8 fl oz. In Europe it is still that size, while in the United
States it increased to 12 fl oz and then, recently, to 20 fl oz (one pint). Many
quick-stop markets in the States, such as 7-11, now sell drinks in three-pint
cups. One is left wondering if the lids on the cups are to keep the contents
from splashing out or the drinker from accidentally falling in. They sell so
well that the company is considering making an even larger size, which its
spokeswoman describes as a "wading-pool- sized drink". 

<p>The increase in portion
sizes didn't happen overnight. It happened a food at a time, usually with
incremental increases. Little by little, portion sizes crept up, just as
Americans' weight has been creeping up. Most Americans have not the slightest
idea that their average muffins are twice the size and have twice the calories
of what you would buy in London or Paris. Of those who do, some just don't care.
By now it should have occurred to the reader to ask: can't Americans just eat
less of these monster portions? Of course they can. But that defeats the
purpose. If you wanted four McDonald's hamburger patties you could always buy
four hamburgers or two Big Macs. But the new super-sized portions allow you to
have all the food with none of the guilt because, after all, you have only eaten
one portion. Michael Fumento, an American, is a science correspondent for Reason
magazine. His book on the obesity epidemic will be published next year by Viking
Penguin.

<FONT SIZE=4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>The Lindora Lean For Life program is helping people just like you achieve healthier lives through responsible weight management.<P>
Our program is far more than a "diet." Lindora offers a comprehensive medical solution to weight control.  Our program is created to address your individual physiological and psychological needs through a unique, three-phase approach.<p>
<B>Weight Loss-</B> During this phase, one-on-one daily visits provide you with counseling and medically-based solutions to make dietary compliance more comfortable. You will lose fat by employing your body's natural ketogenic energy system, which allows you to tolerate a low calorie diet while burning stored fat for energy.  You lose weight safely while protecting esssential lean muscle tissue.<p>

<b>Metabolic Adjustment-</B> At Lindora, we understand that losing the weight is only the first step.  For lasting success, you must learn to keep it off.  Upon reaching your lean weight goal, or after any weight loss phase, it's essential to carefully and gradually increase your food intake.  This metabolic adjustment phase is structured to help you reset your "appestat" so you retain the results you've achieved during the weight loss phase.<p>

<B>Long Term Maintenance- </B>Having achieved your "Lean for Life" goal, this lifetime phase of the program is essential to your lasting success.  During long term maintenance, you will experience a physiological change when you reset your appestat center.  We emphasize the importance of low-fat food choices, exercise, relaxation, and other stress control techniques and coping strategies which empower patients to stop using food as a "tranquilizer."

<FONT SIZE=6><CENTER>We Know The Overweight Person Is Different</FONT SIZE=6></CENTER><hr>
<font size=4><BLOCKQUOTE>Over the past 25 years, we've helped more than 100,000 men, women, and children succeed in losing weight.  From that experience, we've learned that overweight people face unique physiological and psychological challenges.  Not only are dieters challenged by cravings that cause them to overeat, but often they can't eat normally without gaining weight.<P>

<b>Physiologically, </B>the dieter is often different than a thin person in the way his or her body handles carbohydrates and insulin.  They have become a "fat-storing machine."  Knowing this, Lindora has designed a program to help change the dieter's body chemistry to that of a "fat-burning machine."  Overweight people are also different in that their muscles are typically not as efficient at using stored fat for fuel.  To help counter this condition, Lindora utilizes a unique approach to exercise-- "gentle exercise"--which stimulates your muscle cells to increase their mitochondrial surface.  As a result, your body's ability to burn fat increases.  <p>

<B>Psychologically,</B> dieters must overcome a self-image of fatness to achieve and maintain lean body weight.  Lindora has developed special strategies, tools, and techniques such as a "skinny mirror," affirmation audio tapes, Lean for Life videos, and a monthly patient newsletter to support you in achieving your goal.

<font size= 4>
It was showtime. As a burst of applause and the show's lively
theme music filled the room, television talk show host Maury Povich made
his entrance. He stopped center stage, stared into one of the cameras and
began sharing a story that instantly riveted the audience.
&quot;When we first met Diana Rosenfeld,&quot; Povich began, &quot;she needed
an oversized wheelchair and a freight elevator just to make it into our
studios.<p>

As a montage of video clips showed astonishing images of Diana struggling
to walk, he explained that she had once weighed even more: 641 pounds.<p><BR>
&quot;Just getting around had become a major production,&quot; Povich continued,
&quot;and she tried just about everything to lose weight. Diana was desperate.
She had to do something. Finally, she found the Lindora Clinic.  It was working.
Diana's last-ditch diet was paying off.&quot;
Povich briskly recapped her three previous visits on the show while powerful
photographs of a steadily shrinking Diana appeared on the studio monitors.
&quot;I remember Diana well when she was 641 pounds, 409 pounds and 316
pounds. I wonder what she looks like now? I haven't seen her since she came
to our studio today on this trip to New York. Now everyone let's please welcome, the new Diana Rosenfeld.&quot;<p>

On cue, Diana emerged. She looked radiant. More to the point, she looked
healthy! Povich shrieked with delight when a beaming Diana stopped mid-stage
and did a spontaneous twirl to show off her new body. As she confidently
strolled past her lifesize &quot;before&quot; picture and toward the host's
open arms, the audience sprang  to its feet.<p>

More than a few of the onlookers were moved to tears. I was one of them.
I couldn't help but remember the day I first met Diana. Was this animated,
vibrant woman standing on stage in a Manhattan television studio really
the same person who had struggled through our front door at the Lindora
Medical Clinics in Costa Mesa, California just three years earlier?<p>

Over the years, from my first job with Lindora as a 19-year-old medical
assistant through today in my present position as its president, I've met
thousands of overweight people. Diana was, without question, the largest
woman I had ever met. None of the clinicians at Lindora had ever worked
with anyone her size, but that was no reason for us not to. While a majority
of the people who do our medically supervised weight-control program want
to lose between 30 and 60 pounds, we had been successful in helping many
people lose between 100 and 250 pounds.<P>

At 641 pounds, Diana had two choices: to lose weight or die. Other doctors
and programs had declined to work with her, writing her off as a lost cause.
But we believed we could help her. We knew that Diana's goal to lose weight
was realistic and achievable. We also knew that our program, which has evolved
over 25 years with five million patient treatments, is scientifically sound
and would be safe and healthy for her. What's more, we knew that if she
followed it, it would generate the results she said she wanted. The only
unknown was whether Diana possessed the desire, commitment and level of
enthusiasm it takes to achieve any goal.<P>

She certainly did. As her weight melted away, Diana's spirits soared. She
soon became a goodwill ambassador for Lindora, sharing her success story
on television and radio shows all over the world. Her story appeared in
magazines and newspapers nationally and internationally. She was, as they
say, &quot;hot copy.&quot;<P>
<CENTER><TABLE>
<TABLE BORDER =5%>

<IMG SRC="DianaR.gif"></center>
</TR>
</TH>
</TABLE></CENTER><BR>
With each new television appearance or newspaper story, interest in Diana
and our weight-loss program escalated. Thousands of phone calls, some from
as far away as Japan, England and Egypt, flooded our switchboard. We even
received a call from one of the entertainment industry's best known stars,
wondering whether we'd consider opening our clinic near Beverly Hills earlier every morning so she could slip in and out undetected on her way to the studio.<P>

<CENTER><B>&quot;ANYTHING YOU CAN SEND ME IS MORE  THAN I HAVE NOW&quot;<BR></CENTER></B>
Stacks-sometimes bags-of &quot;fan mail&quot; arrived for Diana nearly every
day. Whether the letters were postmarked from Seattle or Shreveport, there
was a common thread in every one of their stories: a sense of hope that
if Diana could do it, they could, too. What people wanted, pure and simple,
was the program Diana used. &quot;Anything you can send me,&quot; wrote
a woman from Detroit, &quot;is more than I have now.&quot;<P>

While the enormous outpouring of interest was heartening, it was also frustrating.
Every letter and call reminded us that behind the statistics-60 millions
Americans are obese; one of every three adults in this country weighs more
than 20% above their ideal body weight-there are people searching for solutions.
But since our program was offered exclusively in a clinical setting, we
couldn't help anyone who couldn't visit one of our Southern California clinics.<P>

Or could we? Was it possible to take a complex program that was currently
being provided by trained nurses and doctors in our clinics and simplify
it without compromising safety, quality or results? It was essential not
only that people do the program safely and comfortably, but that they achieve
results comparable to those our patients had come to expect.<P>

<center><B>&quot;AT HOME BUT NOT ALONE&quot;<BR></center></B>
We launched a Lindora &quot;At Home But Not Alone&quot; program to explore
the possibilities. Over 12 months, we worked with men and women ranging
in age from 24 to 68. Some lived thousands of miles away. Each received
an instruction manual that was far less comprehensive than this book, along
with a package of support products that included audio tapes, a step counter,
vitamins and an assortment of medical-grade protein supplements to be used
in addition to a healthy menu of lean meats, vegetables and fruit. We monitored
their progress by telephone.<P>

Within nine months, the verdict was in. The program was a success. People
throughout the country were enjoying impressive results. Ron, a computer
programmer from Dumfries, Virginia, lost 102 pounds. Candice, a 24-year-old
hotel executive living in New York City, dropped 30 pounds. Stan, a Mississippi
newspaper editor, lost 49 pounds and recovered from major surgery faster
than his doctors expected.<P>

And then there was Tommy McGruder. In May, 1995, we received a call from
Mary Grady, a television news reporter from KCBS, the CBS affiliate in Los
Angeles. She explained that a man weighing more than 800 pounds had been
carried out of his house by eleven firefighters and taken to County USC
Hospital. He was in respiratory distress and was literally being crushed
to death by his excess weight.<p>

Grady, whose station had done several stories on Diana Rosenfeld wondered
if anything could be done for McGruder. Though he lived just a few miles
from our Inglewood clinic, McGruder had been bedridden for two years, unable
to walk. He would need to be treated through our &quot;At Home But Not Alone&quot;
program.<p>

On May 8, 1996, Tommy McGruder celebrated one year on the program. So far,
he has lost more than 450 pounds. Tommy's experience was yet another validation
that we had successfully developed a way to provide the at-home guidance
and support so many thousands of people had sought.<BR>
As you read this book, you won't be alone, either. While it cannot duplicate
the support that our patients receive from trained professionals in our
clinics, this book is your gateway to a number of valuable resources, including
Lindora's site on the World Wide Web, our monthly newsletter and our telephone
resource center, where you can call for answers to any questions you may
have along the way.<p>

<center><B>THE LEAN FOR LIFE ADVANTAGE</B><BR></center>
As you'll discover, <I>Lean for Life</I> is much more than a book about
how to lose weight. It's a book about change: changing the way you eat,
the way you look, the way you feel and the way you think. It's a comprehensive,
personalized program in which you'll discover how your self-image and your
relationship with food have led to the weight problem you've decided to
address. You will <I>gain</I> awareness as you <I>lose </I>weight. You'll
learn how to become Lean for Life. And most importantly, you'll learn how
to <I>stay</I> that way.<p>
While writing this book, we asked Lindora patients for suggestions. One
woman, a patient in our Laguna Hills clinic, was adamant: &quot;Spare me
a lot of theory. Just show me how to lose the weight and show me how to
keep it off!&quot;<p>
That's exactly what this book does. <I>Lean for Life</I> guides you through
a straight-forward, results-oriented program designed to help you lose weight
rapidly, safely and comfortably. One month from today, you can weigh 15
pounds less than you do right now-and you can re-do the weight-loss phase
of the program until you lose all the weight you want!<p>
<center><B>THE THREE PHASE APPROACH TO 
BECOMING - AND STAYING-LEAN FOR LIFE</B><BR></center>
The Lean for Life program is divided into three phases: Weight Loss, Metabolic
Adjustment and Lifetime Maintenance. You'll do all three phases while eating
healthy, nutritious,<I> real</I> food from the grocery store.<p>
&quot;Phase 1: Weight Loss&quot; lasts 28 days or less, depending on your
weight-loss goal. During Phase 1, you'll be limiting your calories and your
intake of carbohydrates-your body's primary energy source-so that your body
will rely on its alternate energy system, body fat, for energy. <p>

As anyone who has ever dieted knows,<I> losing</I> weight is only the first
step. The challenge is<I> keeping</I> it off, which is exactly what the
second phase of the program is designed to help you achieve.<BR>
After<I> each</I> four-week weight-loss series you choose to do, you will
move on to &quot;Phase 2: Metabolic Adjustment.&quot; During this 14-day
period, you'll be increasing your body's metabolism-the rate at which you
burn calories-by gradually adding selected foods to your eating plan. Phase
2 is structured to help you retain the results you've achieved during the
weight-loss phase. When done properly, you will adjust your metabolism<I>
without</I> experiencing a weight gain.<p>
<BR>
<B><hr><HR>
<CENTER>THE BENEFITS OF THE  LEAN FOR LIFE PROGRAM<BR></CENTER></B>
If you've ever tried traditional dieting-and who hasn't?-you know what an
uphill struggle it can be. You think about food and are nagged by cravings.
You often feel sluggish or irritable. And if and when you<I> do</I> lose
weight, it's typically a slow, tedious process.<BR><p>
On the Lean for Life program, you'll lose weight rapidly, burning excess
body fat as fuel at the fastest rate possible while maintaining your lean
muscle mass. What's more, you'll have fewer cravings and feel less hungry,
less often. You'll experience increased energy and feel terrific!<P>

After you've lost all the weight you want to lose and have successfully
completed &quot;Phase 2: Metabolic Adjustment,&quot; you'll graduate to
&quot;Phase 3: Lifetime Maintenance.&quot; This is as vital to your success
as the two earlier phases of the program. During Phase 3, the goal is specific:
to adjust your setpoint so that you can begin to eat &quot;normally&quot;
without gaining weight.<p>

The eating plan and success strategies featured in this book have been refined
over time. Since 1971, we have worked exclusively with overweight people.
Lindora nurses and doctors have logged more than 5 million patient treatments.
This book represents what we've learned along the way, and presents it in
a daily format that's easy to follow and fun to do. As you move through
the program day-by-day, you'll experience for yourself how the knowledge,
awareness and skills you gain will support you in becoming-and staying-Lean
for Life!<B><p>
<center>A PERSONAL JOURNEY</B><BR></center>
 The beauty of the program is that for every success story as compelling
as Diana Rosenfeld's or Tommy McGruder's, there are thousands of people
just like you who have succeeded in losing 10, 25 or 50 pounds.<BR><p>
Throughout every page of this book, my goal is to be your guide, to lead
you on a journey that will be both enlightening and effective. During this
process, I'll share with you dozens of stories of people who were once where
you are now, wondering how to begin the program and what to expect.<BR>
At Lindora, we've learned much of what we know from the experience and stories
of real people. But there's one person's story that's especially close to
my heart. If it weren't for her, it's unlikely the Lindora program would
have ever existed.<p>
A few weeks after I first started working on this book, I was sitting at
my dining room table, surrounded by reference material. But rather than

What distinguishes those who succeed from those who don't? Over the years,
Dr. Marshall Stamper, founder of the Lindora Medical Clinics, has noted
that Lindora patients who succeed in losing weight-and maintaining their
weight loss-share a number of qualities that clearly contribute to their
success on the program. Do you possess those qualities? It's time to

<BR>
research, I found myself staring out the window and thinking about my Grandma
Angie, the woman whose battle with obesity is what ultimately inspired my
father, Dr. Marshall B. Stamper, to begin what was to become Lindora Medical
Clinics.<p>

My grandmother was a bosomy, robust woman with a rich Southern drawl, a
big laugh and an even bigger heart. For as long as I could remember, she
had always been a very large woman. Once, when I couldn't have been more
than five or six years old, I was sitting on the bed as she undressed. I
had never seen her without a dress on, and I remember being mezmerized by
her mammoth thighs.<p>

I was too young at the time to appreciate the health risks associated with
carrying so many extra pounds, just as I was too young to really understand
where the pounds came from in the first place. Grandma Angie was a fabulous
cook and I loved watching her prepare one of her specialties-large, soft,
white pieces of fat fried in a heavy, blackened iron skillet. I can still
taste the crisp, bacony pieces of fat and the squares of fried bread that
she prepared in the leftover liquid fat.<p>

Unfortunately, not all my memories of my grandmother are as pleasant. One
Christmas Eve, several years later, the holiday spirit was shattered when
she nearly died of congestive heart failure resulting from obesity. I remember
feeling totally helpless as the ambulance pulled away, its shrill siren
fading into the night. Not too long after that, my grandmother died from
complications of obesity.<p>

I KNOW ALL TOO WELL THE TOLL EXCESS WEIGHT CAN TAKE. I'M THE
GRANDDAUGHTER OF A WONDERFUL WOMAN WHO DIED TOO SOON BECAUSE
SHE ATE TOO MUCH. I'M THE DAUGHTER OF A MAN WHOSE PASSION FOR
HELPING OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE HAS HAD A MAJOR IMPACT IN SHAPING
THE WAY I THINK ABOUT DIET, HEALTH AND FITNESS. I'M THE MOTHER
OF A FOUR-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, DETERMINED TO RAISE HER WITH
A HEALTHY BODY-AND A HEALTHY BODY IMAGE-IN A CULTURE THAT REVERES
FRIGHTFULLY THIN MODELS AS THE FEMININE IDEAL. I'M ALSO SOMEONE
WHO LOST WEIGHT ON THE PROGRAM 25 YEARS AGO AND WHO CONTINUES TO PRACTICE ITS PRINCIPLES TO MAINTAIN MY WEIGHT TODAY.  I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS PROGRAM AND AM PROUD AND DELIGHTED TO BE ABLE TO SHARE IT WITH YOU. </B><P>
<HR><HR>
<FONT SIZE=4><CENTER><B> FACING THE  FEAR </B><BR></CENTER>

Fear of failure. It's the single most common reason for not starting a weight-loss
program. If you've ever dieted and not lost weight-or regained whatever
weight you did lose-some degree of apprehension is natural.<BR><p>
The question is how to deal with that fear. Will you manage it or will it
manage you? It's easy to let fear surface in the form of excuses: &quot;I'm
too stressed and busy to start anything new right now&quot; &quot;I always
gain it back anyway, so what's the point?&quot; &quot;I don't really feel
that bad.&quot; But will statements like these help you achieve your weight
loss goal?<P>
The Lean for Life program offers a rare opportunity for you to practice
life-management skills while losing weight. Take a few minutes to read several
of the &quot;Lean for Life Success Stories&quot; featured throughout the
book. You can be sure every one of these people experienced episodes of
fear and self-doubt along the way. And yet they did it. They were determined
to overcome the fear of failure in order to earn the pride of accomplishment.
They succeeded.<BR>
You can, too.<BR>
<HR><HR>

<BR><CENTER><B>CREATING YOUR OWN  SUCCESS STORY</B><BR></CENTER>
This book is a collaborative effort in the truest sense of the word. It's
not only a collaboration between me and the thousands of Lindora patients
and &quot;Team Lindora&quot; employees whose wisdom and personal experience
it reflects, but ultimately it's a collaboration between us. You. And me.
That's because Lean for Life is not simply a book you <I>read</I>.
It's a book you <I>do</I>. And until you make it come to life by doing
the program it provides, it's merely paragraphs on a page.<P>

The most important story has yet to be written.  It's yours.  Unlike a novel,
in which the author's imagination determines the fate of the main character,
how this book ends is ultimately up to <I>you</I>. It's your success
story--one you are about to create.<P>

The first step is turning the page.<BR>

<hr>

<FONT SIZE=4>Mitochondria.</font color="red"> They're the tiny, egg-shaped structures in your cells that serve as fat-burning furnaces. Too small to be seen
with the ordinary microscope, there are trillions in every human
body.  The more mitochondria surface you have in your cells, the easier
it is for your body to burn stored fat for fuel.  If you want to burn more body fat, you need to increase the amount  of mitochondrial surface in your cells.

<P>How can you do this? By increasing the amount of gentle exercise
you do every day, you will increase the mitochondrial surface
in your muscle cells. The result? It'll be easier for your body
to burn stored fat for fuel.</font>
<P>
How much gentle exercise does it take? You don't have to devote
a big block of time to it. Four fifteen-minute walks distributed
throughout your day can be just as productive as a continuous
hour of exercise. For most people, adding thirty to sixty minutes
of gentle activity every day will do the job. Remember: The more
mitochondria you have, the more easily your body can burn body
fat for fuel. As it becomes easier to use up excess body fat,
you'll lose weight more rapidly, move more easily, feel healthier
and become leaner.

<P>
Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh recently completed
a study of fifty-six sedentary, overweight women. Each began walking
and/or cycling five times a week for forty minutes. Half of the
women worked out continuously for forty minutes; the other half
divided their daily exercise into four ten-minute sessions.  
After twenty weeks, both groups had boosted their aerobic capacity.
But there was a difference. Not only did the women who exercised
more often, but for shorter periods, adhere better to their exercise
schedules, they also lost more weight.
<P>
It's important to create a schedule that works for you--one that
allows time to do whatever exercise you plan for the day, whether
in long sessions or short. Why not take a fifteen-minute walk right now? Let yourself be pleased. Let yourself get moving. Feel the difference.<BR>

<P>
Lean for Life also shares the insights and strategies of such
inspiring &quot;success stories&quot; as Diana Rosenfeld, who
lost 420 pounds on the Lean for Life program.  Rosenfeld's twice-yearly
&quot;update appearances&quot; on The Maury Povich Show generate
thousands of calls and letters from viewers seeking information
on a program that until now was available only in Southern California.
Rosenfeld serves as the official Lean for Life Ambassador and
is regularly featured in the national media.<BR>

<TITLE>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#DDAODD"><FONT SIZE=4>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>LINDORA PROGRAM</CENTER></FONT></B>
<HR WIDTH=60%>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Q:  How much weight do people lose on the Lindora program?</B><P>

<FONT SIZE=4>A:  This is among the most frequent questions we're asked.  It is also the
most difficult to answer because it is so individual.  And it is one of the
least <B>important</B> questions to ask because it has little to do with long-term
success.  Generally, the most reliable predictor of weight loss is one's
starting weight.  Two real-life examples demonstrate this: <P>

One, an 820-lb. man in L.A. we started treating as part of the Ambassador
Program (a non-profit group where extremely obese individuals are treated without charge in
order to better learn how they lose weight).  He was losing up to 30 lbs. a
WEEK while still bed-ridden, and eating about 1,000 calories per day. <P> 

Second, on the other end of a spectrum, was a 112-lb. young woman attending
a clinic in Hollywood, 10 miles from our Ambassador.  She was preparing for
a part in a movie and was working hard at getting down to 105 lbs.  After
two hours of daily exercise and less than 15 gm. of fat per day intake, she
just could not drop below 112 lbs.  She started the program and after 8
weeks was safely at her goal weight.  <P>

These two individuals were following the same basic program.  They both
required close monitoring and daily feedback, but for much different
reasons.  <P>

Although one's starting weight is the most consistent predictor, it is not
always reliable.  We have treated other patients with starting weights over
500 lbs. who had great difficulty altering their behavior and, therefore,
losing weight and those less than 30% over weight for whom we had to stop
the weight loss phase early since they were losing too much.<P> 

A more important question to ask of any weight loss program is, "How LONG do
people keep the weight off?"  Many people "succeed" at losing a lot of
weight, only to regain it within a year or two.  Lindora has reported the
best long-term results of any weight loss program, but it comes with a
price...daily monitoring and effort, and ongoing vigilance. (for additional
info, please see the FAQ, "How long do people keep the weight off?")<P>


<B>Q.  How long do people keep the weight off after completing the Lindora program?</B><P>

A:  Lindora has reported the best long-term results of any weight control
program to date.  The average length of time people keep their weight off is
very individual.  As in most life-altering behavior changes, the best
predictor of success is time in the program.  Dr. Stamper recognized this 25
years ago when he founded the weight loss program.  He insisted that long-term
maintenance be heavily emphasized and offered it free of charge so that
money would not become an obstacle to participation.<P>

Now, 51% of patients are 20 lbs. or more below their starting weight 2 years
after beginning the program.  Inclusion in this group requires
continued long term maintenance (weekly weighing and counseling sesions;
long-term diet plan).  Unfortunately, less than 5% of patients take
advantage of long term maintenance.  Most feel confident they can maintain
their weight on their own and tire of the daily efforts required to be held
in check.<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>MEDICATIONS</CENTER></FONT></B><HR WIDTH=60%>

<B>Q.  When are medications prescribed to help with weight loss?</B><P>

A. Most doctors using these meds reserve them for people  
who have medical complications associated with being        
overweight (high cholesterol, sleep apnea, etc.).  However, 
given the good long-term results and low rates of side      
effects reported by Weintraub, many doctors are beginning to   
consider using them for people at low to moderate risk of   
complications.   Keep in mind that Weintraub's study was based on outcomes in just 27 people.  A much different picture may emerge once the medications are used by millions of people in this country.  <P>                                            
 You may want to call the Bariatric Physicians Society at   
1-303-779-4833, get a list of doctors in your area, and call   
them to discuss their philosophy on using them.   <P>          


<B>Q:  I started out at a weight of 180 lbs.  My doctor prescribed a
combination of phentermine and fenfluramine.   He changed me to another type
of phentermine when I wasn't doing  as well as he expected.  He said I was
his first "failure!" <P>
I don't notice any difference in it  either. If I don't show a significant
loss in the next couple of months  he said he wouldn't prescribe me any more
pills. I have lost about 15  
pounds in 4 months.  He thinks I should have lost 40 by now.</B><P>

A:  This story makes several important points:
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. The average weight loss due to the combination of phentermine and
fenfluramine is just 10% of total body weight.  Starting at 180 lbs, that
would mean a loss of just 18 lbs.  Actually, by that prediction, you are right where you should be!  What people find particularly disturbing is that they usually need to continue to take the medications just to assure they don't regain that modest weight loss; that means continued costs associated with doctor visits, pills, lab tests, and a growing risk of side effects.  There are MANY people who have experienced much better and longer-lasting results but they still constitute the minority.<P>
2.  It's not just the medications.  Exercise, frequent monitoring,
counseling, and an appropriate, well thought-out diet plan are no less
important than they ever were.<P>		
3.  Many physicians dispensing these medications are poorly trained and
under-experienced.  Anyone suggesting a patient was his first "failure"
would certainly be guilty of both.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
                                                            
<B>Q:  Should diuretics (water pills) be taken for weight loss?  Do you lose
more water on a diet?</B><P>

A:  In general, "protein-sparing diets" do have a diuretic     
effect and going off the diet often results in subsequent   
water retention.  HOWEVER, there are many other causes of   
edema and diuretics should not be taken without first being seen
by your doctor.  <P>
                                                            

<B>Q.  Can fenfluramine (Pondimin) cause depression?</B><P>

A:  There are several associations between fenfluramine and depression: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Fenfluramine is commonly used in assessing whether endogenous depression
exists (by measuring a decrease in prolactin levels).<P>

2. Fenfluramine (and dex-fenfluramine) have been implicated as causative
agents in depression.<P>

3. Fenfluramine (and dex-fenfluramine to a greater degree) have been
implicated as effective treatments for depression, though their usefulness
is probably limited.<P>
4. Fenfluramine (and dex-fenfluramine to a lesser degree) have been
implicated as effective treatments for related disorders including anxiety,
premenstrual syndrome, bulimia.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

In some people, fenfluramine and dex-fenfluramine relieve depression, while
in others they exacerbate it.  For that reason, either medication should be
prescribed cautiously (though are not specifically contraindicated) in
people who are clinically depressed.<P>

For those patients currently taking fenfluramine who develop symptoms
consistent with depression, a causative relationship should be considered
and may be justification for changing medication or adding a specific
anti-depressant SSRI such as Zoloft or Prozac.<P>

There is not yet enough evidence to claim that, for patients with a history of related disorders such as anxiety,
premenstrual syndrome, or bulimia, fenfluramine may be a useful adjunct and
improve treatment outcome.<P>


<B>Q:  My doctor recommended taking the phen/fen for 4 weeks 
and going off for one.  I was never hungry when I first     
started this program but all of a sudden it quit working. </B><P> 

A:  Years ago, that is how many physicians prescribed these meds (actually,
many still do) since the FDA recommended they be used for no more than 4
weeks in order to minimize side effects and since they became ineffective
after 4 to 6 weeks when taken alone.  The Weintraub study has changed that
though recent results suggest the combination may just delay the eventual
weight gain.   You need to focus more attention on exercise, eating
properly, and positive mental conditioning when this happens.<P>


<B>Q.  Can phentermine & fenfluramine cause brain damage?</B><P>

A. There is really very sketchy evidence that phen/fen  
(particularly the fen) affects brain cells.  Most of that   
concern stems from studies on rats given large to "enormous"
doses.  The damage was transient for lower doses and         
consisted of "darkened neurons (nerve cells) and enlarged   
perineuronal (surrounding the neuron) spaces."  Does this   
mean there will likely be serious brain changes in people   
taking fen?...no one can really say for sure.  But it has   
been in use by many people for 15+ years without evidence of
such effects.    <P>                                           
 Of greatest concern is the seemingly temporary confusion and short term memory loss reported by about
2% of people taking it.  For this reason, other medications that increase
serotonin (Prozac, e.g.) may be preferred.  A cautious approach is warranted, balanced by
weight loss results and effect on other  measures
such as cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar,  and mood.<P>

<B>Q:  What can you tell me about diethylpropion (Tenuate)?</B><P>

A:  Tenuate has been used by many people trying to lose weight in the past; most    
people lose some weight for some length of time.  However,  
it has not been shown to be as effective for long periods,  
is more likely to lead to tolerance (needing more medication
to achieve the same effect), and has side   
effects just as other medications used for weight loss have, such as fluoxetine (Prozac) or fenfluramine (Pondimin)
and phentermine (Fastin) used in combination.<P>

The generic name for Tenuate is diethylpropion.   <P>             


<B>Q: I'd like to learn more about the Weintraub study.</B><P>

A:  The original papers appeared in Clinical      
Pharmacologic Therapy 1992; 51(5):581-650 and should be     
available at a local medical school or hospital library     
(call first).  <P>

You may write to Univ of Rochester to request a 5-page     
summary of the study to share with your doctor:

<B>Q.  Does fenfluramine (Pondimin) make you drowsy?</B><P>

A.  Many people get very drowsy when taking fenfluramine or dex-fenfluramine alone.  Even with phentermine, 3 times a day, for some it is a whopper.  In Weintraub's study
and in our experience, people tend to have fewer side effects when taking the two
together though some people still experience considerable drowsiness.<P>  

Some physicians have taken to prescribing phentermine in the morning and
fenfluramine at night to minimize that effect.  Although that may work for
some, that is not how the two were initially studied and it is less certain
that the benefits will be the same.<P>

<B>Q: I have been on the phen/fen meds for two months and have lost well and
feel great; however a few of my friends suggest  that the phen/fen should be
taken at the SAME time for best results. Should I be taking a fenfluramine
at the same time in the morning that I take the phentermine?  I usually take
the 30 mg. phentermine when I wake and 20 mg. fenfluramine at noon and in
the afternoon.  However if I miss the noon fenfluramine, then I find I am
really hungry.</B><P>

A:  The most accurate statement that can be made about these meds is that
they do not produce the same effects in everyone.  In fact, the range of
experiences is quite different than with many medicines although every
medicine shares that property.  As an example, there are many people who get
complete headache relief with aspirin, many who get very little, and a
few who are unable to tolerate it at all.  Similarly, both the beneficial
and side effects of phen/fen vary widely.<P>

Timing of dosages similarly varies--some people get the best result taking
both once in the morning, others find splitting the two works better, while
a third group may find one or both of the medications intolerable.  Be very
careful if someone, particularly a doctor or nurse providing the medication,
suggests that everyone does best taking it at such-and-such a time or dose.
You should work with medical professionals who are well trained and who have
had experience in following many people who have taken the medications under
various conditions.<P>


<B>Q:  Do hormones taken at change of life cause weight gain?  Isn't that what
they give farm animals to fatten them up?  </B><P>                                 

A:  There are medications that are known to cause weight gain.
Corticosteroids taken at high doses &/or for extended periods (e.g.,
Prednisone for chronic conditions; NOT asthma inhalers used to prevent
attacks) are probably the worst offenders.  Amitriptyline (a common trade name is Elavil) is another
example.  It is less clear whether women's hormones are implicated.
Surprisingly, one study which specifically measured the change in weight
after menopause found that women who took hormones gained LESS weight than
those who did not.  Bear in mind, however, that BOTH groups gained.  It's
difficult to determine how much of the weight gain is due to hormones vs.
change in lifestyle, increased fat, decreased activity, and the realm of
other known causative factors.<P>
 
                                                            
<B>Q:  What does it usually cost to lose
weight in a medically supervised program?  I have been on the phen/fen program for about 6 months now. I
haven't had much success. The doctor felt it's because I take generics!  My
first vist was over $400 for a blood test.  Since I haven't lost but 10 lbs
in 6 months, they repeated my blood test again and charged me $220.  I
purchase my meds at the doctors office and they are not covered by
insurance.  They cost around $65.00 per month.  I'm willing to pay anything
if only it will work and know that once I reach my goal weight the meds will
be decreased and therefore not as expensive.</B><P>

A:  You're question raises several important points:<P>
1) Like you, many people will do (or spend) ANYTHING in order to lose
weight.  My colleagues and I often say that people would drink lye if they
believed it would help them lose weight.<P>
2) Less than ethical physicians will often charge anything to people who are
so inclined.  You have a right to know what various procedures and
treatments cost the medical clinic you attend.  A blood test should not cost them
more than $40; more expensive tests can be done but the information is
unlikely to produce any additional insight or affect the outcome.  Also, the
phen/fen medications are quite inexpensive.  Some clinics greatly mark up
the price.  Call around a few pharmacies to get a sense for the range of prices.<P>
3) There are few medications which are more effective in the trade vs. generic form.  Phen/fen are not among them.<P>
Other points of interest:  It's not always fair to assume that the medication would be decreased
once goal weight is reached.  On the contrary, a majority of people who lose
weight primarily by taking medications have discovered that they quickly
regain their weight once they stop taking them.  Worse, among those who
continue to take the meds, many find that they lose their effectiveness over
time.  Some may continue to get good results for several years before the
effect wanes.<P>

It is difficult to simply answer the question, "What should a program cost?"
A better question may be, "What does the program provide?"  Stay away from
programs that just offer medications.  Remember that side effects of
medications can be very serious and, if you are not being closely followed
and offered a comprehensive program of weight loss, your chances of being
affected greatly increase.  For more information, see the FAQ on how to
choose a program.<P>

<B>Q:  I have been taking phen/fen for several weeks.  At first it worked
well, but now I take it and it does nothing for my cravings (anything sweet).
Do you think I need a dose adjustment?</B><P>

A:  Possibly; but this trend has been reported by university and private
groups that are closely following people who have been taking the
medications for extended periods of time (more than 2 or 3 years).  Among
those people who we can be quite sure are taking the meds regularly, most are
regaining quite a bit of weight.  Those doing best are continuing, or even
increasing, other components of weight control such as exercise, regular
monitoring, and thought control.<P>


<B>Q:  I have been prescribed phen/fen by my doctor, but recently moved and now
cannot find any way to get them.  Do you know of drug mail order firms who
might offer these meds?</B><P>

A:  There are illegal sources of nearly every medication or substance known.
Bodybuilders can get steroids and diuretics (water pills) and dieters have
been known to get all kinds of remedies abroad or underground.  Given the
poor results seen among those losing weight primarily by taking pills and
the worse complications that have been noted in conjunction with appetite
suppressants, you'd be better off going to a reputable clinic.<P>

<B>Q: Has anyone felt that their sex drive was lower after taking phen/fen?</B><P> 

A:  Yes, this can be a very bothersome side effect of the medications and
affects both men and women.  It appears to increase in likelihood the longer
someone is on the meds.  Some people have gone as far as taking other meds
to counter the problem though that often doesn't work well.<P>

<B>Q.  My doctor recently prescribed phen/fen for me, but cautioned me that he
had recently had a visit from the DEA telling him that he could not continue
to prescribe meds for people who are at their goal weight.  So, he told me, 
"as long as you are losing weight, and I can document that, 
then I can continue this therapy for you." <P> 
                                                            
When I went to have the prescription filled, the pharmacist had a fit about
the twice daily dosage that was prescribed.  She said, "you won't be able to
sleep!  Are you SURE that the doctor wanted you to do this?"  <P>

Another doctor I saw is an Internist with a specialty in Eating disorders.
She would not give me fenfluramine (trade name Pondimin) because of some
studies in Europe where the patients took it and apparently dropped  dead. </B><P>

A:  There still are a lot of professional medical people who are unfamiliar
with these medications or demonstrate undue alarm.  There are potential
risks associated with these medications.  What makes these particularly
risky is that many doctors are prescribing them without much familiarity in
their use or potential peril, many people are obtaining them illegally or
inappropriately, and well-designed studies are not available as they are for
many medicines.  Having said that, the risks are still quite low as long as
people are medically supervised by well trained physicians and nurses.<P>


<B>Q.  Does chromium help in weight loss?</B><P>

A.  The latest news on chromium is not encouraging.  Early      
studies suggested it could increase lean muscle mass and    
improve sugar metabolism.  Subsequent studies (which were   
done with more precision) showed no such association.       
It probably won't hurt or help, so may as    
well save your money. <P>                                      

<CENTER><B>GENERAL DIET QUESTIONS</CENTER></B></FONT><HR WIDTH=60% HIGHT=10%>

<B>Q.  How should I choose a diet?</B><P>

A.  In evaluating any diet, consider: <P>    
 <BLOCKQUOTE>1.) How easy would it be to follow for a lifetime?<BR>         
 2.) Is it heart-healthy (relatively low fat & salt)? <BR>      
 3.) How much preparation is required? <BR>                     
 4.) Where will the foods come from; do they use only
pre-packaged foods?    <BR>                                    
 5.) Do you enjoy the foods?  <BR>                              
 6.) What does it cost?<BR>  
7.) What are the long-term (more than 2 years) results?<BR>
 <P> </BLOCKQUOTE>                                 

Although many diet plans can lead to considerable weight loss,  
FEW have been shown to produce consistently good, long-term results     
(i.e. 95+% return to original weight within 3-5 yrs).     <P>       

A relative (& significant) decrease of either fat,    
carbs, or protein can help you lose weight; a high protein/ low carb
& fat plan, IN GENERAL, has led to faster weight loss than     
plans based on decreasing proportions of fat/protein and increasing
carbohydrates.  <P>     
However, the key ingredient to a good plan should be        
tolerability or ease of continuing the program.             
Theoretically sound plans, like those that are extremely restrictive and
thus offer few food choices, often fall far short in that regard.<P>

There have been comprehensive reviews of various diets. Consumer Reports
reviewed popular diets a few years ago.  It'd be worth looking for.  <P>

<B>Q.  What are the eating habits of the fittest?</B><P>

A.  It's interesting to hear how many of the "ultimate" models, athletes,
and bodybuilders (men with less than 10% body fat) eat in order to maintain
their physique.  This is a typical example:
       <BLOCKQUOTE> Protein: 40+%<BR>
        Carbohydrates: 20%<BR>
        Fats: 10 - 20%<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
Very few people are willing to make the sacrifices required to achieve their
level of fitness.  <P>

<B>Q:  How important are genetics in obesity?</B><P>

A:  By current estimates, the relative proportions of factors causing
obesity are divided as:<P>

       <BLOCKQUOTE> 30% cultural<BR>
        45% habits<BR>
        25% gentetic<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

Interestingly, among children who are obese, 1 parent is obese about 60 -
70% of the time; though both parents are obese only 20 - 30% of the time.<P>


<B>Q: What are the pros & cons of low fat vs. low carbohydrate diets?</B><P>

A:  Low fat diets offer a wide variety foods and are heart-healthy.
Negatively, they may be associated with "fat cravings," poor taste (sugar
should also be cut), and easy to underestimate total intake.<P>

Low carbohydrate, high protein diets produce a more rapid weight loss with
water loss and ketosis (fat breakdown) and taste good (particularly if you
enjoy poultry and fish).  Negatively, there may be a more narrow variety of
natural foods to select from and should be followed on a more moderate scale long-term.<P>

The best results may be realized through a combination of low carb, high protein eating initially, followed by low fat during maintenance.<P>

<B>Q:  What are the key necessary steps to losing weight?</B><P>

A:  There are as many opinions of what steps are necessary as there are
people considering themselves "expert" in the field.  Among the most
successful weight loss programs studied, Lindora's Lean for Life, they define
6 "essentials," presented under the Lindora icon.<P>


<B>Q:  How can I keep off the weight I lose?</B><P>

A:  The Lindora Medical Clinics have entered every patient's daily visit
results into a networked database.  They have found two variables that best
predict long-term weight maintainence:  (1) regular weighing by someone
other than yourself; (2) exercise.  The first appears particularly important
since problems and opportunities (to gain weight) inevitably arise; but
having a support system in place makes dealing with them possible.<P>

For a different, but supportive, perspective, Anne Fletcher, in "Thin for
Life," describes 10 keys to success, held in common by the "experts"--those
who have lost a lot of weight and kept it off for a long time:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Believe you can be thin for life<BR>
2. Take charge<BR>
3. Do it your way<BR>
4. Accept the food facts<BR>
5. Nip any increase in the bud<BR>
6. Learn the art of positive self-talk<BR>
7. Move it or lose it<BR>
8. Face life head on<BR>
9. Get more out of life<BR>
10. Don't go it alone.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>


<B>Q:  How can I prevent cravings while dieting?</B><P>

A:  There are many useful tips that can lead to decreased cravings:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Change your body chemistry by adhering to your diet plan and maintaining
your weight for long periods.<BR>
2. Change your self-image of fatness by using mental imagery, thought
control, and positive affirmations.<BR>
3. Be aware of people, emotions, and situations that set you up to eat or
make poor choices.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>


<B>Q:  How much weight can I expect to lose I diet, exercise, or take medications?</B><P>

A:  The most reliable indicator of how much one person will lose is how much
they have to lose.  As an example, for a person who is 20% above their ideal
weight, the following real life average results have been reported in
various studies:<P>

Exercise (defined as running about 5.5 mph, for 20-30 minutes, 4 times a
week) = loss of 0.3 lbs per week (about 0.2 for overweight women, 0.4 for overweight men).<P>

Fiber (either 3 natural sources--bran cereal, apples--or supplements per
day) = 0.3 lbs per week.<P>

Diet (defined as eating 1000-1200 calories per day, low fat) = loss of 1.2
lbs per week<P>

Medications (as described in the Weintraub study) = 1.0 lbs per week<P>

Very Low Calorie Diets  = 3.3 lbs per week<P>

Of course, a combination of efforts produces the most impressive results and
improved maintenance over time.   At one end of a spectrum, those who are
extremely overweight drop weight incredibly fast.  The non-profit Lean for
Life Foundation treats people who are at that extreme.  They comprise the
"Ambassadors" and follow the same medical program as other patients
attending Lindora Medical Clinics.  A recently added member had a starting
weight of 820 lbs.  He was losing as much as 30 lbs a week safely and
permanently.<P>


<B>Q:  Do people lose more weight on high protein diets?</B><P>

A:  There is a general consensus among researchers and   
doctors doing this work that people can lose more rapidly on
a low carbo diet.  There is not much evidence that high     
protein dieting leads to significant health problems if     
you're followed closely by a medical team and you're getting enough
carbohydrates.  The upper and lower ends of protein intake appear less          
important.  I would count carbs instead and try to stay     
within about 80 - 100 grams per day.  That is a low to      
moderate amount; you should not feel very hungry. <P>          


<B>Q: I get very hungry in the evening.  I'm fine the rest of the day.  Why is
that?</B><P>

A:  Large numbers of people have been surveyed throughout the day to learn
how hunger changes over time.  Most people report being hungriest in the
early afternoon, around 4:00 to 6:00 p.m.  So it may be no accident that our
largest meal is usually at that time of day.  Even shift workers who sleep
and wake at much different times experience that sensitivity to afternoon
cravings. <P>
The evening craze can be reduced by eating smaller but more frequent meals,
light exercise such as walking, and relaxation techniques.<P>

<B>Q:  My last serious weight loss effort was for 8 mos. on Susan Powter
coupled with 6 days a week of 1 hour aerobics classes.  I gained 20 pounds!
I am now up to my all time weight.  I have put so much effort into so many
programs, that I have been just about ready to just give up.</B><P>

A:  First, you're experience is not unusual.  Many people have the belief
that they cannot lose weight without vigorous exercise.  Actually, exercise
is not generally an effective weight LOSS method but it is an excellent
weight MAINTENANCE method.  That means it's important to continue exercise
throughout and beyond weight loss but the benefits will not be as apparent
during weight loss as one might hope.<P>

<B>Q.  I have hypothyroidism.  Will that affect my weight loss or whether I
should take appetite suppressants?</B><P>

A.  It is a common misconception that "fixing" the thyroid 
will result in a return to normal weight.
There are some facts you and your doctor should be aware of in selecting a
treatment plan. First, treating hypothyroidism results in about a 8%
reduction in the amount of excess weight (e.g., if someone is 100 lbs
overwt, fixing the thyroid can produce a 8 lb wt. loss).  Second, although
some of the appetite suppressant medications are thermogenic, there is
rarely any additive effect when taken by those on Synthroid.  Third,
reducing your weight can improve your thyroid & general health.<P>

The same treatment options & rates of efficacy apply to you
as to most.  Here are some other
contacts:  <P>

<B>Q.  I have a complex illness and am overweight.  How will that affect my
weight loss.</B><P>

A.  Your situation may be complex but is not hopeless.  People with serious
illness should seek professional help when attempting weight loss.  You may
want to start with a university's medical hospital Endocrinology Department,
a practicing endocrinologist, or call the American Society of Bariatric
Physicians at 1-303-779-4833 and interview several in your area.

<h1> UTME  COMPUTING  FACILITIES </h1>
<img src="../icons/line.white.gif"><p>
The Department of Mechanical Engineering has set up an advisory committee chaired by
Professor S.R. Karpik to help maintain a strong computer network for graduate research.  The
department employs a full-time computer specialist, F. Koerth, who is in charge of maintaining
the integrity of the system, installation and repair of equipment, and responding to user
problems.  The department has just replaced all the wiring and network devices in order to
accommodate the department's expanding needs and future technology.
 The Department of Mechanical Engineering has continued to respond to the growing
importance of computers with an excellent array of computing equipment for both teaching and
research purposes.  The latest technology is provided in a network of Sun workstations and
servers.  NCD X-terminals attached to 2 central servers, a Sun SPARC Server model 10/512 and
a Sun SPARC Server model 20/612, provide high level graphics capabilities.  Additional graphics
seats are provided by 5 Sun SPARC station 2 workstations, used cooperatively through the
Center for Computer Integrated Engineering (CCIE).  The central servers are also available for
computational tasks, document processing, electronic news and electronic mail service.  Sharing
over 15 GBytes of disk storage, 4 laser printers including a QMS Thermal Color Laser Printer,
four tape drives, and an 8 mm Exa-byte for high density backups, these UNIX systems are made
available to both undergraduates and graduate students; in practice, undergraduates do the bulk
of their work on a faculty-wide undergraduate system.  Numerous software packages are
available, including SDRC/I-DEAS, ANSYS, SUN PHIGS, Open Windows, LaTex, IMSL, UTEMP
(University of Toronto Mechanics Program), MATLAB, FRAMEMAKER, WordPerfect for UNIX
and  MAPLE.<p>

Apart from the UNIX systems, there is a large network of IBM PS/2's complete with servers
available to students who require DOS.  CAD/CAM is also supported by our IBM PC networks
which are equipped with various plotters and laser printers.<p>
 In addition to departmental research computers, numerous research laboratories have
dedicated computer systems as well.  In particular, the following laboratories have dedicated
DEC or Sun computers solely for the use of their research groups: Computational Mechanics,
Image Analysis, Engine Research, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Robotics and Automation. 
In all, there are about 60 interlinked computer systems with close to 100 terminals connected to
the central computing facilities.<p>
 In addition to the computing machines, the Department has established good communication
links with the Engineering Computing Facility (ECF).  The service provided by the ECF is
primarily for teaching, but may also be used for research activities as required.  In particular,
ECF operates a Silicon Graphics SGF 4D/480 system with 256 MB of memory which can be used
for research computing.  Beyond the facilities of the Faculty is the University's central
Computing Services (UTCF) which is both an IBM and UNIX shop.

<title> The department of Mechanical Engineering </title>
<pre><img align=middle src="../icons/utme_logo.gif"></pre><p>

<img align=middle src="../icons/line.blue.gif"><p>
The Department of Mechanical Engineering opened its first engineering
laboratory in 1892.  Since that day it has continued to enjoy a
reputation of housing some of the finest research laboratories in
Canada, and indeed in the world, in a broad range of disciplines
relating to Mechanical Engineering.  Over the years, the thrust and
the emphasis of the Department's activities has changed to reflect 
priorities within our society.  Our current activities remain
broad-based, but particular areas of activity include manufacturing,
robotics, mechanical design, biomechanical engineering and environmental
studies.  These specific areas are supplimented by the fundamental
and traditional areas of Mechanical Engineering which include mechanics,
thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, dynamics and materials science.<p>

<h3> Message from the Chair </h3>
This handbook has been designed by our Office of Graduate Studies, 
to provide all graduate students with...<p>
<ul>
a detailed introduction to both the University and our Department, 
an introduction to our research activities, and
particulars about our course offerings.
</ul> <p>
The Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering not only offers a diverse graduate 
program that is a leader in Canada, but also has developed a worldwide reputation as one of 
the top ranking research institutions. As of May 1996, there were 244 registered graduate 
students.  Of these, 101 were Ph.D. students, 66 were M.A.Sc. students, and 77 were 
M.Eng. students.  The Department offers two undergraduate programs: Mechanical 
Engineering and Industrial Engineering. Last year, there were 468 students in the 
Mechanical Engineering program and 198 students in the Industrial Engineering program.<p>

<h1> APPLIED MECHANICS </h1>
<img src="../icons/line.red.gif"> <p>
<i><U>Professor W.L. Cleghorn</U></i><p>
     Analysis and design of high speed flexible mechanisms (kinetoelastodynamics).  Finite
element analysis applied to vibrations. See also <A HREF="cleghorn/main.html">Research and Projects</A>.<p>

<i><U>Professor R.G. Fenton</U></i><p>
     Kinematics of mechanisms and machines.  Dynamics.  Elasticity, plasticity and stress
analysis.  Design of mechanisms, machines and special purpose robots.  Finite element analysis. <p>

systems.  Application to control systems. Control of systems with indefinite inner
products. <p> 

<i><U>Professor S.A. Meguid</U></i><p>
     The purpose of this research activity is to apply advanced analytical and numerical
techniques to evaluate the structural integrity of critical components in the aerospace, power
generation and automotive industries. Of particular interest, to this research program, is the
study of anisotropy and inhomogeneity and their effect upon the crack initiation, crack
propagation and possible crack arrest in both traditional and advanced composite materials.  For
further information, see the book on <i>"Engineering Fracture Mechanics"</i> by <i>S.A. Meguid</i>.  For
example, the work is typically concerned with blade fixing in aeroengine discs, interfaces as in
welded constructions in the power generation industry, microcracking and bridging in advanced
ceramics and their composites.  This work is currently being conducted in the Fracture and
Failure Analysis Laboratory. <p>

<i><U>Professor J.K. Mills</U></i><p>
     Dynamic modelling of robots with structural compliance, i.e. link, transmission flexibility
effects.  Analysis of high frequency dynamic characteristics using the theory of singular
perturbations.  Modelling of payloads with structural compliance using distributed parameter
models generated analytically and with dynamic finite element analysis methods. <p>

<i><U>Professor F.P.J. Rimrott</U></i><p>
     The study of one aspect of shell theory is undertaken, viz. the response of slit tubing
to loading, in support of design and analysis of extendible antenna masts and collapsible
structural booms for spacecraft.  Tension field theory is applied to membranes with in-plane
body forces, in support of design and analysis of solar power generation panels for spacecraft. 
Longstanding involvement in gyrodynamics of dissipative bodies has led to the establishment
of the collinearity theorems for single body solid gyroscopes, which form the basis for ongoing
studies of attitude stability and attitude drift of spinning spacecraft. There is work underway in
the application of chaos theory to mechanical systems, and research is undertaken in analytical
mechanics into the application of the concepts of energy and complementary energy for
mechanical systems. <p>

<i><U>Professor A.N. Sinclair</U></i><p>
     Both analytical and experimental work is conducted on resonant frequencies and
mechanical wave propagation characteristics of engineering structures.  This has led to the
development of an ultrasonic high-cycle fatigue problem, whereby the crack propagation
characteristics of aerospace alloys are studied by using ultrasound to promote crack propagation. <p>

<i><U>Professor J.K. Spelt</U></i><p>
     The broader application of structural adhesive bonding is hindered by a general lack of
engineering design principles.  Our research focuses on the development of a comprehensive
methodology for the prediction of the fracture of bonded joints.  The challenge is to create a
design method which is applicable to joints of arbitrary geometry, made of any structural
adhesive, and subject to all types of quasi-static, cyclic or constant loads.  In parallel, we are
investigating the failure mechanisms of bonded joints, and developing ways of incorporating
environmental degradation into the fracture-based failure criterion.  Various elements of non-
destructive evaluation are being used to assess the degradation of adhesive joints. <p>

<i><U>Professor J. Van de Vegte</U></i><p>
     Vibration Control of Rotating Systems. The project is concerned with analytical and
experimental work for the balancing of large rotating systems without interrupting operation.
Thus far, flexible shaft systems with two balancing planes were considered, and current work
aims at extending this to multirotor systems with more than two balancing planes. <p>

<i><U>Professor R.D. Venter</U></i><p>
     Structural integrity, fatigue and fracture of metals.  Special applications relate to the
investigation into the crack propagation of ductile ferritic steels employed in the nuclear
industry.  Development of J and CTOA resistance curves for design of nuclear piping systems. <p>

<i> <u> Professor J.W. Zu </u></i><p>
Research focuses on mechanical vibrations, dynamics and stability analysis of conservative
and non-conservative systems, self-adjoint and non-self-adjoint systems.  Both linear and non-
linear vibrations are considered.  System modeling is established based on the fundamental
principles of mechanics.  Solutions are obtained via analytical or numerical approaches.  In the
analytical approach, modal expansion technique is one of the main methods adopted.  In the
numerical simulation, finite element method is the main tool to tackle the problems. 
Experiments on vibration measurements, testing and modal analysis are also part of the research
to complement the theoretical and numerical work.  Particular attention in the research is given
to structural dynamics and rotordynamics.<p>

<h1> BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING</h1>
<img src="../icons/line.red.gif"> <p>
<i><u>Professor C.R. Ethier</u></i><p>
     Current research interests are related to fluid flow and mass transport in biological
systems.  We carry out research in three specific areas.  Firstly, experimental
investigation and numerical modelling of blood flow in arteries and arterial grafts are being conducted so as
to identify fluid mechanical influences on graft failure.  Secondly, the production and outflow
of aqueous humor within the eye is being modelled and experimentally studied in an ongoing
study of glaucoma.  Thirdly, fluid flow and solute transport through connective tissue is being
investigated. <p>

<i><u>Professor A.A. Goldenberg</u></i><p>
     Development of robotic aids for the handicapped.  Robotics for surgery and
micro-surgery. <p>

<i><u>Professor D.F. James</u></i><p>
     Research consists of fundamental studies in various fields of biomechanics. Recent work
has included temperature rise in bone drilling, dental implant stress analysis, perfusion through tissue, while
current research is focusing on physiological lubrication.  To understand how joints are
lubricated, we are analyzing squeeze-film lubrication, taking into account the properties of
cartilage and the rheology of synovial fluid. <p>

<i><u>Professor D.McCammond</u></i><p>
     Analysis of stresses associated with dental implants and prosthesis. <p>

<i><u>Professor S.A. Meguid</u></i><p>
     External skeletal fixation devices used in the treatment of open or unstable longbone
fractures rely on the use of pins.  These pins transfer the loads between bone fragments and the
relatively rigid structure of the fixator for controlled immobilization at the fracture site.  External
loads applied to the fractured limb by adjustment of the fixator frame or by muscle contraction
generally cause pin bending which may result in pin loosening, pin track infection or bone
fracture.  The main objective of these studies is to evaluate the pin-bone interface stresses using
both experimental and theoretical techniques. <p>
     In addition, efforts are devoted to identify a link between the quasi-static and dynamic
responses of a tennis racquet and the pain experienced by many tennis players; namely, lateral
epicondylitis.<p>

<i><u>Professor M. Milner</u></i><p>
     There are opportunities for involvement in a research and development programme in
Rehabilitation Engineering which relates to the development of devices, systems and techniques
to aid disabled persons. Some specific concerns of the programme include postural support,
mobility systems, microcomputer applications, prosthetics and orthotics, applications of robotics,
and human locomotor engineering aspects including gait study and functional electrical
stimulation of skeletal muscles.<p>

<i><u>Professor A.W. Neumann</u></i><p>
     Application of thermodynamics to processes of biomedical relevance: Modelling of cell
and protein adhesion to synthetic and natural biomaterials with the view of improving vascular
implants.  Studies of phagocytic ingestion of bacteria by white cells from the point of view of
surface and interfacial tensions.  Application of surface thermodynamics to biotechnological
problems. <p>

<i><u>Professor C.A. Ward</u></i><p>
     When a person is subjected to a substantial pressure change, one of the consequences can
be bubble formation in the circulatory system. This occurs, for example, when an individual does
deep-sea diving or when flying high performance aircraft.  Complement activation is one
consequence of the interaction between the bubble surface and blood plasma, and it may mediate
decompression sickness.  We are developing a method to determine the susceptibility of an
individual to decompression sickness by determining the amount of complement activation that
occurs when bubbles are incubated with a sample of the individual's plasma. <p>
     The compatibility between a synthetic material and blood is determined in large measure
by the degree of complement activation that follows the exposure of blood to the material.  We
are developing methods for preparing a material so as to minimize the degree of complement
activation.  The objective of the research is to provide a sufficiently compatible material so that
it can be used for replacement of small diameter arteries. <p>

<i><u>Professor A.A. Goldenberg</u></i><p>
     Off-line simulation and programming of robotic based automation: systems, devices, work cells
and special grippers.<p>

<i><u>Professor S.A. Meguid</u></i><p>
     Probably no development in the history of engineering has had as much effort expended
upon it in such a short time as the application of computers to assist in most design-related
activities.  These activities include:  interactive computer graphics and modelling,
computer-aided analysis, computer-aided draughting and computer-aided manufacturing.  The
purpose of this research program is to bring all these seemingly specialised topics together and
to demonstrate their integration in the design process through practical application to real
engineering problems, such as landing gear assemblies, fluid coupling units and shot-peening
equipment.  For further information refer to the book <i>"Integrated Computer-Aided Design of
Mechanical Systems"</i>  by <i> S.A. Meguid </i>. <p>
     In addition, extensive work is currently being conducted to develop new elements for
treating material and geometrical nonlinearities.  Specifically, contact algorithms using the
variational inequalities method have been developed and applied to a number of engineering
problems, such as gears, dovetail joints in aeroengine discs and interfacial cracking of multi-
layered materials. <p>

<i><u>Professor F.P.J. Rimrott</u></i><p>
     Computational techniques are developed and applied, in particular for problems
involving chaotic behaviour of mechanical systems. <p>


<i><u>Professor L. Shu</u></i><p>
Designers need computer tools not only to manage complex data associated with environmental impact, but also to integrate environmental considerations with traditional design requirements.  

Computer implementation of traditional engineering tools is useful for predicting life-cycle environmental performance of products.  For example, reliability modeling is necessary to predict system failure and part replacement, which directly determines resource consumption and waste generation.

Development of life-cycle frameworks that consider specific aspects of product design, such as material choice or joint design, is helpful for gaining new perspectives on familiar design parameters.  Such frameworks may also result in building design-for-environment knowledge that can be generalized and applied to other aspects of product design.<p>
  
<i><u>Professor R.D. Venter</u></i><p>
     Modern industry requires computer aided engineering tools.  Application of IDEAS
software tools to the design, analysis and simulation of all manufacturing processes and
products.  Particular emphasis is given to the tool, die and mould (TDM) industrial sector
(injection moulding, NC machining).  Theses will usually be linked to an industrial project
requiring solution. <p>
<i> <u>Professor J.W. Zu</u></i><p>
 Computer-aided analysis and design on vibration problems in machinery and structures.  A

<h1> ENERGY STUDIES </h1>
<img src="../icons/line.red.gif"> <p>
<i><u>Professor S. Chandra</u></i><p>
     Hydrogen ignition: There has been in recent years much interest in the use of hydrogen
as a non-polluting, renewable fuel.  However, concerns about the safety of producing, handling,
and storing hydrogen supplies need to be resolved before widespread use of hydrogen as a fuel
is feasible.  Experiments are being done to study the ignition of gaseous
hydrogen-oxygen-nitrogen mixtures, over a range of mixture compositions, temperatures,
pressures, and for a variety of ignition sources (e.g. electric sparks, hot surfaces). The ability to
specify, and therefore avoid, the conditions for ignition will allow the safe use of hydrogen on
a commercial scale. <p>

<i><u>Professor A. Mandelis</u></i><p>
      Research in this area is focussed on fundamental and applied energy conversion studies of
high-technology microelectronic and optoelectronic materials, mainly crystalline and amorphous
thin-film semiconductors (e.g. silicon and GaAs) and laser crystals.  The main thrust is in
developing and utilizing a prototype spectroscopic instrument (Photopyroelectric Spectroscopy)
to study and characterize such energy conversion materials through their optical spectra and a
novel, unique, optical-to-thermal energy conversion spectroscopy, which monitors the minute
thermal energy release from the material as a function of wavelength of the exciting radiation. 
This allows, for the first time, the detailed study of the optical quality of the material.  The goal
is to generate sensitive quality control instrumentation for industrial high-technology use.
<p>

<i><u>Professor S. McCahan</u></i><p>
     The interaction between hot molten metal and water can produce an explosive reaction. 
These events, called thermal explosions or fuel-coolant interactions (FCI), are responsible for a
long history of destructive accidents in industry.  Research in this area is divided into two parts;
experimental investigation of the phenomena and computational modeling of the reaction wave. 
The experimental study is aimed at determining the relationship between the mass of the metal
and the minimum metal temperature necessary to initiate the explosion. <p>

<i><u>Professor J. Mostaghimi</u></i><p>
     Thermal plasmas are high temperature gases comprised of free electrons, ions, and
neutral atoms/molecules.  Due to the presence of charged particles, they can interact with the
electric and magnetic fields.  Thermal plasmas, having temperature between 3000 K to 30000 K
are generated by means of dc/ac arcs, radio-frequency (rf) inductively coupled plasmas, and
microwaves. Research in this area is divided into three area of : <br>
<ol>
<li> plasma diagnostics, <br>
<li>mathematical modelling, and <br>
<li> process development. <br>
</ol>
Facilities include a 6-kW, 2450 MHz microwave plasma generator.  Some of 
the current projects are in the area of spray coating of metals and ceramics using dc and microwave plasmas, 
temperature measurements of a microwave plasma by emission spectroscopy technique, mathematical
modelling of rf plasmas, prediction of thermophysical properties of thermal plasmas using Boltzmann 
kinetic theory, and chemical vapor deposition of diamond films in a microwave plasma reactor. 
<p>

<i><u>Professor A.W. Neumann</u></i><p>
     Application of surface thermodynamics to energy resources processing: Coal and oil
sands.  Development of strategies to determine the wettability of finely ground coal with the
view of improving coal separation from minerals by flotation; study of spherical coal - oil
agglomeration from the point of view of surface forces.  Studies of the pressure dependence of
the interfacial tension of bitumen - water in order to break bitumen - water emulsions. <p>

<i><u>Professor M. Thomson</u></i><p>
Experimental and numerical studies of combustion,  focusing on air 
pollution emissions,  waste combustion and industrial furnaces.  
Techniques include experimental flow reactor studies,  chemical kinetic 
modeling and computational fluid dynamic modeling.<p>

<i><u>Professor J.S. Wallace</u></i><p>
     Combustion of alternative fuels in IC engines is the main topic of research in the Engine
Research and Development Laboratory (ERDL). Investigations examining the use of propane,
methanol, dissociated methanol, and hydrogen in spark ignition engines have been carried out. 
 A major effort is currently underway to maximize the emissions benefit offered by the use of
natural gas as a fuel.   As an example, one aspect of the project is a detailed analysis of the
exhaust gas composition to determine the specific hydrocarbon species present.  This information
will improve our understanding of the sources of hydrocarbon emissions and enable engine
designers to minimize the emission of reactive hydrocarbon species. <p>
     The use of alternative fuels in diesel engines is also a topic of research in ERDL.  
Alternative fuels share the characteristic of poor ignition quality.   Accordingly, the research has
focused on ignition, primarily on the use of a hot surface (glow plug) as a means of ignition
assist. Projects have been carried out with hydrogen, propane and methanol.  Because of the
single point ignition, it is very difficult to achieve reliable ignition and complete combustion
throughout an engine's entire load and speed range.  In the current project, flame stabilization
techniques normally used for continuous combustors are being applied to a glow plug equipped
IDI diesel in an effort to eliminate this difficulty. <p>
     Optical measurement techniques provide a non-intrusive means of acquiring additional
information about the combustion process.  Of particular interest is the use of optical fibers to
provide optical access to engine combustion chambers.  Their small size and flexibility minimize
changes to the normal combustion chamber geometry to facilitate installation.  Development of
optical fiber measurement systems is underway for planned applications to SI and diesel engine
alternative fuels combustion projects. <p>

<i><u>Professor C.A. Ward</u></i><p>
     A new design for a mobile, lightweight DC power supply is being developed.  It consists
of a fuel cell and a hydrogen storage system. The latter stores hydrogen in a solid that reacts
with water to produce hydrogen for the fuel cell and the water generated in the fuel cell is
returned to the hydrogen storage system to generate more hydrogen; thus reducing the amount
of hydrogen that must be stored and the weight of the system.  The energy density (W.hr/kg)
of this system for many applications is several times that of conventional batteries. <p>

Research is being conducted in several areas of Environmental Engineering.  Air-sea gas
exchange is important when considering the build-up of carbon dioxide and other greehouse
gases in the atmosphere.  Our group is currently developing a system of fiber optic probes to
measure the size distributions of large bubbles entrained by breaking ocean waves.  The long-

entrained by breaking waves to air-sea gas exchange.  Funding for this project is provided by
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and NSERC.  In addition, we are conducting a study
of the effects of zebra mussels in the western basin of Lake Erie.  This project includes field
experiments to measure the relevant physical and biological parameters in situ and numerical
modelling of the complex physical and biological interactions.  This research is funded by the
Great Lakes University Research Fund.  The transport of toxic chemicals between the atmosphere
and the Great Lakes is the focus of a field study sponsored by Atmospheric Environment
Services of Environment Canada.  The objective of the study is to determine the importance of
extreme atmospheric events (i.e. storms) in enhancing the air-water transfer of gaseous

<h1> FLUID SCIENCES </h1>
<img src="../icons/line.red.gif"> <p>
<i><u>Professor W.D. Baines</u></i><p>
     Research is centered in fluid flows driven by buoyancy.  Specific studies have been
focused on plumes, heat transfer by jets, free convection at large Rayleigh numbers and forced
convection over bodies with heat generation.  Problems studied have applications in ventilation,
pollution dispersion, thermal energy storage and mixing in large containers.  Most solutions have
been obtained using a combination of laboratory experiments, simplified analyses and numerical
simulation. <p>

<i><u>Professor I.G. Currie</u></i><p>
     Research in the area of fluid sciences includes non-intrusive velocity measurements using
Laser-Doppler Anemometry.  A well-equipped LDA Laboratory exists in which measurements
are made involving both single-phase and two-phase flows.  The single-phase flows involve
refractive index matching of the fluid and solid components of the apparatus, thereby permitting
optical access to obscure parts of the flow field.  The two-phase flows include liquids with gas
or vapour bubbles, in both diabatic and adiabatic situations.  A complementary analytical
program exists.  Application of the measurements program are made to the design of heat
exchangers and to flow-induced vibrations. The latter include vortex-induced vibrations and
galloping.  Analyses include both classical mathematics and numerical/computational methods. <p>

<i><u>Professor C.R. Ethier</u></i><p>
    Current research interests involve computational fluid dynamics, fluid flow at low Reynolds
numbers, the fluid mechanics of filtration, and visualization of unsteady flows.  Specific topics
being studied are: advanced finite element simulation of 3-D incompressible flows, flow
visualization using the photochromic dye tracer technique, flow through complex or
inhomogeneous porous materials, hydrodynamic properties of polymers in solution, and
formation of mass transfer boundary layers during filtration.  Most of the problems are tackled
using a combination of theoretical, numerical, and experimental methods. <p>

<i><u>Professor D.F. James</u></i><p>
      Research focuses on the flow of non-Newtonian fluids, particularly to understand the rheology
of viscoelastic fluids like polymer solutions.  The extensional viscosity (or elasticity) of these
fluids is of particular interest because this fluid property is the operative one in important
industrial applications such as secondary oil recovery.  <br>
Our objective is to characterize this property : 
<ol>
<li> by developing instrumentation to measure fluid elasticity and <br>
<li> by analysing kinematics and dynamics at the microscopic or molecular level to develop 
constitutive equations.  
</ol> <p>

<i><u>Professor S. Karpik</u></i><p>
     My research is concerned with the computational challenges posed by the problem of
modeling incompressible fluid flows whose motions may be either laminar or turbulent.  The
objective of this work is to develop the ability to simulate a wide range of environmentally
interesting flows (for example, the short and medium range transport of airborne pollutants over
complex terrain or the dispersal of heated waste water in lakes and rivers).  As a consequence
of the fact that this type of modeling can be very expensive and even tax the capabilities of
supercomputers, I am actively involved in the development of more economical and robust
numerical methods.  Depending on the particular application, my work employs various
combinations of finite difference, finite element, pseudospectral and multigrid techniques. 
Other research interests include object oriented programming methods and the development
of algorithms for parallel computation. <p>

<i><u>Professor J.G. Kawall</u></i><p>
     My research deals with the development of hot-wire anemometry and flow-visualization
methods for the acquisition of digital turbulent-flow data, the development of digital signal
image processing methods for the computer-analysis of flow signals and flow-visualization cin
pictures, and the application of these techniques to a wide variety of laboratory-generated
turbulent flows.  Specific applications are in the areas of building aerodynamics and plume
dispersion. <p>

<i><u>Professor J.F. Keffer</u></i><p>
     The focus of the research is the experimental investigation of turbulent-flow phenomena
through the use of hot wire anemometry and digital image analysis of flow visualization. This
research has two basic objectives, viz, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the physics of
turbulent flows and to obtain quantitative information about these flows, both of which are
relevant to a wide range of industrial and natural turbulent-flow problems.  Current research
includes: <p>
<ul>
<li>Properties of the turbulent/non-turbulent interface characterizing free and partial-bounded
flows, such as wakes, jets, boundary layers, mixing layers and wall jets. 
<li>Detection of the coherent structures embedded within turbulent flows using pattern
recognition, spectral and correlation analyses and phase averaging, and determining the role of
these structures within turbulent transport processes.
<li>The structure of complex turbulent flows in which the phenomena of negative production
occurs. 
<li>Experimental studies on wind induced erosion and suspension of surfaceparticles supported
by Lagrangian dispersion modelling.
<li>The mechanisms of turbulent combustion.
</ul> <p>

<i><u>Professor M.R. Loewen</u></i><p>
Current research topics include acoustic remote sensing of breaking waves, air entrainment
by breaking waves, the dynamics of large-scale breaking waves and the stability of a rotating
cylinder of fluid.  A series of laboratory experiments are being conducted in a computer
controlled wave channel at the Canada Centre for Inland Waters (Burlington, Ontario). 
Measurements are being taken of the volume of air entrained, the sound generated and the
energy dissipated by breaking waves.  The objective of the research is to determine how
variations in the water temperature effect these parameters for small-scale breaking waves. 
Experiments to study the air entrainment, sound generation and energy dissipation produced
by large-scale breaking waves are planned.  The experiments will take place in the world's
largest two dimensional wave channel (300m x 5m x 7m) located in Hannover, Germany.  The
primary objective of this project is to investigate the properties of breaking waves over a wide
range of scales.  In addition, an apparatus has been constructed  for studying the stability of a
rotating horizontal cylinder of water.  Experiments observing the different modes of
hydrodynamic instability and the rotation rates at which they occur are being carried out.<p>

<i><u>Professor H.J. Leutheusser</u></i><p>
     In purely laminar flow, attention is focussed on the effects of roughness on thin lubricating
films, on viscous fluid transients in closed conduits of arbitrary cross-section (which constitutes 
an important problem in haemodynamics), and on non-uniform steady flow in open channels, 
as typically encountered in the conveyance of molten substances in certain industrial 
manufacturing processes. <p>
     Ongoing research in mainly turbulent flow includes experimental studies of unsteady
motion in closed conduits, the fluid dynamics of the cooling flow in high-speed bearings, and the evolution of
vortex rings. <p>
     In addition, there is research in progress on the hydrodynamics of weir flow, the
hydraulics of culverts, shear flow between smooth and rough walls in relative motion, and flow
through rotating systems. <p>

<h1> MATERIALS </h1>
<img src="../icons/line.red.gif"> <p>
<i><u>Professor A. Mandelis</u></i><p>
      Research in in-situ, non-contact, non-destructive evaluation of industrial electronic materials,
especially GaAs and Si substrates and device-level chips, involves the development of novel
laser-based techniques to probe deep impurity levels and electronic lifetimes either dynamically
by pulsed laser excitation, or statically in a scanning imaging mode.  A recent technique
developed in our laboratory and called Infrared Radiometric Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy
is capable of detecting remotely semiconductor wafer dopants e.g. in semiconductor laser
materials.  It is aimed to generate a characterization method for industrial optimization of wafer
fabrication and manufacture.<p>

<i><u>Professor D. McCammond</u></i><p>
     Investigation of damage growth rates in Carbon and Kevlar composites under fatigue and
fretting fatigue loading.  This includes the use of NDT techniques to monitor the extent of
damage in individual plies and an analysis using anisotropic finite element techniques. <p>
     Measurement and analysis of stiffness, strength, fatigue and fracture properties of highly-aligned
polyolifin thermoplastics.<p>
 Investigation of the fatigue behaviour of Ti alloys, in particular the effects of biaxiality
and combined high cycle, (HCF), and low cycle fatigue, (LCF), loadings.  The HCF/LCF
interaction is being examined at HCF frequencies up to 30 kHz. <p>
     The research programs are being carried out in the Structural Integrity Fracture and
Fatigue Research Laboratory (SIFFRL). <p>

<i><u>Professor S.A. Meguid</u></i><p>
    <b> The Mechanics of Microcrack Toughening: </b> The needs of modern technology, as well as
the scarcity of traditional raw materials, have stimulated a growing interest in using brittle
materials (ceramics) in critical load-bearing applications.  Such applications are distinguished
from conventional structural uses of brittle materials in that maximum advantage must be taken
of available tensile strength without sacrificing reliability.  The potential value of many brittle
materials is evident when their properties are compared with those required for advances in
several technological areas.  These requirements frequently include unusual combinations of
properties, such as high ratios of strength and stiffness to weight, high hardness, chemical
inertness and dimensional stability over a wide range of temperatures.  Many brittle materials
can satisfy these requirements admirably. <p>
     The objectives of these investigations are to employ micromechanics modelling techniques
to develop a general solution for main crack-microcrack interactions and evaluate the effect on
microcrack toughening in advanced ceramics and their composites. <p>
   <b> Analysis of Cracks Near Bi-material Interfaces: </b>  As the demands made upon the
strength and durability of today's engineering materials increase, the advantages of combining
the properties of two or more materials into a structural member are very appealing.  However,
this same combination of material properties can aid in the failure of these members particularly
at an interface.  Fracture mechanics provides a powerful tool of studying the interfacial crack
problem in bi-materials. <p>

<i><u>Professor C.B. Park</u></i><p>
   <b> Microcellular Plastics:  </b>  An emerging advanced material called microcellular plastics has been
developed during the last ten years.  These unique plastics are characterized by extremely small
bubble size in the polymer matrix which enhances physical properties. Microcellular plastics can
be made of nearly all polymers including amorphous, semicrystalline, elastomeric, thermosetting,
and liquid crystalline polymers. Current issues include processing-structure-property
relationships for microcellular foamed plastics, effects of crystalline structure on the foam
morphology, and the reduction of flexural creep in foamed thermoplastic products. <p>
<b> Plastic/Wood-Fiber Composites:  </b> Wood-fiber reinforced plastic composites have received a
great deal of attention because of their thermoformability and repeated recyclability.  New
compounding techniques and interfacial treatments make it feasible to disperse high volume
fractions of hydrophilic wood fibers in non-polar polyolefins such as polypropylene and
polyethylene.  These compounds can be continuously extruded, thermoformed, pressed, and
injection molded, and thus offer the potential to replace wood and glass fiber composites in
many applications.  Current issues include characterization of PVC/wood-fiber composites and
microcellular foaming of plastic/wood fiber composites. <p>

<i><u>Professor A.N. Sinclair</u></i><p>
     Research is being conducted in the area of nondestructive material characterization, by
means of ultrasound.  Effort is concentrated on digital signal processing of sonic waves in the
0.1-300 frequency band.  The potential for evaluating material strength, toughness,
microstructure, residual stress, and temperature distribution by high frequency waves has been
demonstrated, via analysis of wave attenuation, velocity, and phase as functions of frequency. 
Materials investigated include carbon steel, graphite composites, wood, and plastics.
     The development of new techniques in elastic plastic fracture mechanics is having a
strong impact on the design of pressure vessels and high pressure piping.  Investigations are
being made into new experimental techniques as well as the underlying foundation of concepts
such as the J-integral and crack tip opening displacement. <p>

<i><u>Professor J.K. Spelt </u></i><p>
     Structural adhesive bonding offers many advantages over welding or other forms of high
strength joining.  The study of adhesion is also fundamental to the development of composite
materials and laminated structures. Current research areas include: adhesive wetting and
adhesion mechanisms, degradation and nondestructive evaluation of adhesive joints and
laminates, engineering design of joints and laminates. <p>
     The study of adhesion is also being applied to biofouling or the growth of organisms
(such as zebra mussels) on solid surfaces (pipes, heat exchangers). <p>

<h1> MANUFACTURING </h1>
<img src="../icons/line.red.gif"> <p>
<i><u>Professor B. Benhabib</u></i><p>
     Flexible Material Handling Equipment:  Within the framework of this research area
analytical tools are developed for designing modular/programmable fixtures and workholding
devices.  Design of flexible part transfer devices for automatic assembly processes, integrating
non-contact sensors, is another area which is investigated. <p>
     Sensors:  Research and development on the design and integration of contact and
non-contact sensory devices for automated manufacturing environments include the design and
manufacture of a tactile sensor using fiber-optics technology, investigation of possible uses of
sensors for system safety monitoring, inspection, and, automatic quality control. <p>
     Vision:  Research and development on the design and integration of automatic visual
inspection systems, and also supervisory control of robotic workcells through the use of machine
vision.  <p>
 
<i><u>Professor R.G. Fenton</u></i><p>
     Work is done to determine the set of optimum cutting parameters for multitool
machining operations.  Optimum tool material selection and the best tool change strategy
determination are also included in this work.  Simulation methods for machining optimization
are developed.  The use of statistical methods to determine tool-life equations and predict tool
failures with a certain confidence level from experimental data is undertaken.  The use of the
upper-bound method, the method of characteristics, the principal lines method and the finite
element method are used to solve metal flow problems.  FMS workcell design. <p>

<i><u>Professor A.A. Goldenberg</u></i><p>
     The work addresses research topics in robotic-based automation such as:  off-line
programming, integration of automated work cells, design of reconfigurable and
reprogrammable grippers, and expert systems. <p>

<i><u>Professor C.B. Park</u></i><p>
   <b> Rapid Prototyping and Manufacturing: </b> Today, designs are made quickly and accurately
using solid modeling CAD tools.  However, the transition from the CAD model to the
manufacture of real functional parts such as an injection mould takes a long time (typically 12
weeks).  Moreover, any modifications due to tooling mistakes or design changes are expensive
and time consuming.  Therefore, in order to quickly accommodate the design changes of a 3D
object, development of a fast and inexpensive manufacturing tool is needed. 
 Stereolithography is an effective tool for the rapid manufacture of 3D objects using a
photosensitive polymeric resin and an energy source (such as a laser beam) to cure the resin. 
The 3D object is built up layer by layer by selectively exposing the resin to the energy source. 
Current issues include rapid manufacturing of fully functional products, the development of an
alternative energy source, and the optimization of a U-V light laser-beam delivery system.
<p>
<b> Manufacturing Process for Microcellular Plastics:  </b>Microcellular plastics are an emerging
material receiving a great deal of attention over the past ten years because of their reduced
material consumption and improved toughness and impact strength.  The final form processing
of these polymers however has not received sufficient research attention.  One of the most recent
technological advancements is the development of an extrusion process for the continuous
production of microcellular thermoplastic filaments.  Processing of microcellular plastics has
many challenging scientific and technological issues that should be explored.  Current issues
include the development of environmentally safe blowing agents, extrusion of microcellular
low-density foams, and die design for effective cell growth control.  This research includes not
only the basic science (thermodynamics) of the polymer systems, but also the development of
an industrially viable manufacturing process that fully utilizes the unique properties of
microcellular plastics.
 <p>

<i><u>Professor A.N. Sinclair</u></i><p>
     The development of materials made of recycled plastic and cellulose-based products holds
many advantages, such as conservation of forests, reduction of waste disposal problems. 
Although such engineered materials have many attractive properties, much work is still required
to improve the creep-resistance, uniformity, toughness and density characteristics.  These issues
are being addressed through co-operative projects with industry to manufacture and characterize
new materials through techniques such as ultrasound, creep, and vibration testing. <p>

     Design of Multivariable Feedback Control Systems.  Two approaches are considered, both
aimed at making multivariable system design more "accessible".  One is based on representation
of the dynamics by transfer function matrices, and uses only methods and tools which are
familiar from "classical" single-variable theory.  The other approach is a new nonparametric
analysis and design technique in the time domain.  Here the plant dynamics is assumed to be
available only in the form of a measured impulse or step response graph, and the desired
response is similarly specified by a step response graph. <p>

Several factors contribute to product performance indices such as life-cycle cost and environmental impact.  These performance indices can be optimized using combinatorial methods such as genetic algorithms.

<i><u>Professor C.B. Park</u></i><p>
Solubility and Diffusivity of Blowing Agents in Polymers: The objective of this research is
to determine the solubility and diffusivity of blowing agents in polymers at elevated
temperatures and pressures up to 250¡C and 8000 psi.  The solubility and diffusivity of blowing
agents are required to determine the required flow rate of the blowing agent and the processing
time in microcellular polymer processing.  A sorption experimental set-up is utilized to
determine these thermodynamic and kinetic parameters.  Currently, the solubilities and
diffusivities of carbon dioxide, isopentane, and water in various polymers are studied.<br>
 Cell Nucleation and Growth in Polymers: The objective of this research is to develop a
simultaneous model of cell nucleation and growth in microcellular foaming process.  In order
to better control the quality of foams in manufacturing processes, the bubble dynamics in
polymer systems are investigated.  This is an analytical and experimental study designed to
determine the critical process parameters which affect bubble nucleation and growth in
processing dies.  Currently, the effects of pressure drop rate, temperature, and shearing on the
nucleation of microbubbles in polymers are being studied.  Also, research is ongoing on the
effects of pressure and temperature on bubble growth.<p>

<i><u>Professor A.N. Sinclair</u></i><p>
     The nondestructive characterization of interfacial profiles is an essential ingradient to the
quality control of welds, diffusion bonds, and adhesive joints.  Ultrasound is used to evaluate
the extent of interdiffusion at the interface, and characterize any inhomogeneities.  The work
involves extensive signal processing work, and acoustic wave theory.  The use of the surface
acoustic microscope to determine depth profiles of interfacial layers is being pursued, with
particular application to adhesive bonds. <p>

<i><u>Professor J.K. Spelt</u></i><p>
     High strength adhesives are being used widely to replace or augment welding and
mechanical fasteners, as well as to form an almost infinite variety of composite materials.  We
are studying the dynamics of adhesive wetting as the crucial first step in bond formation. Also
of interest are the environmental stability of the adhesive-substrate interfacial region, the role of
surface roughness in bond performance, and the thermodynamic interpretation of adhesion.  We
are also heavily engaged in the study of biofouling in freshwater; specifically, the recruitment
and adhesion of zebra mussels to solid surfaces such as the walls of pipes and heat exchangers.  <p>

<i><u>Professor C.A. Ward</u></i><p>
     A new theory of kinetics has been developed from quantum and statistical mechanics,
called statistical rate theory, that has a number of advantages over conventional kinetic theories. 
It is being applied at present to examine CO and H2 adsorption on single crystal planes of Ni,
and thermal desorption of CO from thin films of Ni.  Also, it is being applied to examine the
absorption of H2 into metals. <p>

<i><u>Professor A.H. Abdelmessih</u></i><p>
     Two-Phased Flow and Heat Transfer: The work in progress is focused on the
development of mechanistic models based on the two-fluid formulation which follows the
developing flow regimes along the flow field.  Such formulation will result in better prediction
of the two-phase flow characteristics. <p>
     The above-mentioned approach is presently under detailed mathematical formulations
and experimental verifications to predict <br>
(a) The critical two-phase flow in suddenly decompressed saturated and subcooled liquids and <br>
(b) The pressure drop in diabatic two-phase flow in vertical and horizontal flow channels. <p>

<i><u>Professor S. Chandra</u></i><p>
     Cooling of surfaces using liquid sprays: Experiments are being conducted to measure the
heat transfer between heated solid surfaces and impinging liquid droplets and sprays. 
Measurements are made of droplet evaporation rates using a computer based image analysis
system, the variation of surface temperature is recorded by a thin film temperature sensor, and
the dynamics of impact of a single droplet are studied by means of short duration flash
photography.  Droplets of water, hydrocarbon fuels, and liquid nitrogen have been used in the
experiments.  The results of the experiments give information useful in the design of industrial
spray cooling applications, and offer insight into the mechanism of boiling heat transfer. <p>

<i><u>Professor A. Mandelis</u></i><p>
      Advanced laser photothermal instrumentation and measurement science applied to depth
profilometry and scanning tomographic imaging of industrial materials, is currently moving in
two distinct directions:  <br>
<ol>
<li> Analytical, numerical and experimental progress in the thermal-wave
inverse problem, producing depth-profiles of thermal diffusivity in surface-processed materials
non-destructively (e.g. metals, nuclear pressure tubes, plasma sprayed surfaces);  <br>
<li> The measurement of thermal transport properties of thin metallic samples using time-gated laser
thermal excitation and conduction heat transfer transient capture (aimed at on-line metal
manufacturing quality control);  and <br> 
<li> scanning thermal-wave imaging and tomography for near-
surface defect mapping (sub-surface imaging). 
</ol> <p>

<i><u>Professor S. McCahan</u></i><p>
     Most fluids have a positive non-linearity inherent in their behavior.  This non-linearity
is often quantified using the so called fundamental gas derivative.  It is the positive nature of
this non-linearity that gives rise to such phenomena as compression shockwaves while
disallowing their rarefaction counterparts.  However, in some fluids there are areas of the phase
plane that exhibit a negative non-linear behavior.  These substances are referred to as BZT fluids. 
Because of the unusual thermodynamics of these fluids many kinds of typical flow phenomena
are substantially altered.  For example; BZT fluids can sustain a rarefaction shock but not a
compression shock.  There are two areas of interest concerning BZT fluids:  <br>
<ol>
<li> proving the existence of these fluids and exploring their flow behavior under a variety of conditions, and <br>
<li> investigating the possibility of using these types of fluids in typical thermal cycle applications. 
</ol> <p>

<i><u>Professor J. Mostaghimi</u></i><p>
     One of the most important problems in Kraft Recovery Boilers used in paper industry is
the deposition and sintering of materials on the tube banks in the upper part of the boiler. 
While theoretical studies of fluid flow and heat/mass transfer in the lower parts of the boiler
have been carried out rather extensively, little attention has so far been given to the prediction
of particulate deposition in the upper parts of such boilers.  This works aims to study the
mechanisms leading to the deposition of carry over on the steam tube banks in a Kraft Recovery
Boiler. <p>
     The mechanisms affecting the particle trajectories and their deposition are numerous and
their relative significance depends on a number of parameters including the particulate size and
the flow conditions.  In this work, a mathematical model is formulated for the prediction of the
turbulent flow, temperature, and concentration fields in flows between parallel plates.  Particle
trajectories and temperature histories are then calculated and the effects of turbulent dispersion
on the particle deposition on the plates is studied. <p>


<i><u>Professor C.A. Ward</u></i><p>
     There is now great interest in the possibility of processing certain materials in
earth-orbiting laboratories.  Under this circumstance the gravitational intensity approaches 10-6
g.  As a result, new questions of fluid stability arise.  For example, if the two fluid phases of a
substance were present in a cylindrical container and were subjected to normal gravitational
intensity, the phases would be separated with the denser liquid phase at the bottom of the
container.  If the same system were subjected to a gravitational intensity of 10-6 g, then new
thermodynamic properties play a role in determining the configuration that the system will
adopt under equilibrium conditions.  These properties include the surface tension of the
liquid-vapour, solid-vapour and the solid-liquid interfaces.  Depending on the value of these
properties, the equilibrium configuration for the system can be one in which the liquid
completely encapsulates the vapour phase.  The research in this area concentrates on developing
methods for predicting the equilibrium configuration for such a system and on experimentally
examining these predictions.  The experiments are initially designed to be conducted on an
aircraft (KC-135) flying Keplarian parabolas, and if the experiments are successful there, then
further experiments are proposed that are to be performed during either a rocket flight or on a
space shuttle flight. <p>

<h2>  Computational Modelling of Blood Flow and Mass Transfer in Blood </h2>
<h3>  Background </h3>
I have now built up an effective group with considerable expertise in 
numerical modelling of blood flow, and this group is collaborating
effectively with surgeons and biomedical engineers studying various
aspects of hemodynamics.
<h3> Synopsis </h3>
Blood flow patterns influence the behaviour and the artery wall and are
known to promote the formation of some arterial diseases.  We are studing
this process by using numerical simulations to model blood flow and mass
transfer to the artery wall.  To this end, we have developed sophisticated
numerical codes for the simulation of fully 3-D unsteady flows in complex 
geometries and high Schmidt number mass transfer.  Through this work,
and in collaboration with radiologists and vascular surgeons, we are gaining
insights into how blood flow patterns influence arterial wall physiology.<p>

<h3>  Background </h3>
My basic research in aqueous humor outflow and glaucoma was the subject
of my S.M. and Ph.D. thesis, and has been continued at the University of
Toronto.  We have a very effective collaboration underway with ophthalmologists
and bioengineers in the U.S.A.<p>
<h3> Synopsis </h3>
Glaucoma is an ocular disease in which the normal outflow of fluid from
the eye is impeded, causing the pressure within the eye to become abnormally
high.  We are studying the tissues responsible for this process, in an 
attempt to relate tissue structure and function to hydrodynamic resistance.<p>

<h1> Physicochemical Hydrodynamics Laboratory </h1>
<img src="../../icons/line.red-orange.gif"><p>
</ul><p>
<h3>  Background </h3>
This project, which arose as part of my Ph.D. work, has been a research
focus since joining the University of Toronto in October 1986.
<h3> Synopsis </h3>
Polymer ultrafiltration is used in a number of industrial and biomedical
applications.  The efficiency of the filtration process is almost always
limited by the formation of a resistive layer of rejected polymer
molecules upstream of the filter (the so-called "polarized layer").
We are using a novel optical system (designed and constructed over the
last several years) to directly measure the polymer concentration within this
layer, and to thus related layer structure to hyrodynamic resistance.
We have used this system to determine physiochemical properties of
polymers and study factors influencing polarized layer formation.  Ultimately
we hope to use the system to rationally test different strategies for
reducing polarized layer resistance, thus improving filtration efficiency.<p>

<h1> Zebra Mussel Laboratory</h1>
<img src="../../icons/line.red-orange.gif"><p>
</ul><p>
<h3> Research Activities  </h3>
Research is aimed at two objective:<br>
1) Develop ways of preventing biofouling by zebra mussels.<br>
2) Measure the dissolution (corrosion) rates of copper and nickel into
fresh water.<p>
The second objective has arisen from our earlier research which identified
copper-containing materials as superior zebra mussel anti foulants.  
Measurements of copper release rates help us to understand the nature
of these materials antifouling performance, and provide important data
to environmental and health authorities.<p>
<h3> Research Facilities </h3>
- zebra mussel maintenance facility<br>
- wall-jet apparatus to measure zebra mussel adheasion strength<br>
- copper and nickel corrosion-rate measurements based on graphite furnace atomic
absorption spectroscopy<br>
- field station on Lake Erie<p>

A new theory of kinetics has been developed from quantum and 
statistical mechanics.  It is being used to study: Light 
emission from molecules adsorbing on metal surfaces; The
configurational stability of a two phase, fluid system 
subjected negligible gravity; Crystal growth under
microgravity conditions; A mobile, light-weight DC power
supply consisting of a fuel cell and hydrogen storage system.<p>

Mechanical vibrations, dynamics, stability analysis and vibration
control of conservative and non-conservative systems in structures,
machinery, mechanisms and space bodies.  Both linear and non-linear
vibrations are considered.  System modelling is established based on the
fundamental principles of mechanics.  Solutions are obtained via analytical
or numerical approaches.  Vibration measurements are part of the 
research to complement the theoretical and numerical work.  Particular
attention in the research is given to structural dynamics and rotordynamics.<p>

<title> Doctor of Philosphy (Ph.D.)</title>
<h1> Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)</h1>

The Ph.D. program requires successful completion of at 
least five graduate half-courses beyond the Master's 
program, and successful defense of a thesis at both 
Departmental and School of Graduate Studies oral 
examinations. A plurality of the five courses must be 
UTMIE courses. At most one of the courses may be a 500-
level course. <p>
At least two of the following core courses must be taken, 
(a set of two from either of the two groups), at the 
Master's or Ph.D. level, before the student may take the 
Qualifying Examination:<p>
<b>Group I:  (Mechanical Engineering Oriented)</b>
<ul>
MIE1001H - Dynamics II<br>
MIE1101H -  Thermodynamics II<br>
MIE1201H -  Fluid Mechanics III<br>
MIE1301H -  Solid Mechanics <br>
MIE1401H -  Engineering Analysis III<br>
</ul>
<b>Group II:  (Industrial Engineering Oriented)</b>
<ul>
MIE1401H - Design of Work Places<br>
MIE1501H - Information Systems I: Data and Knowledge 
Modeling<br>
MIE1601H - Introduction to Operational Research<br>
MIE1901H - Technology, Society, and the Environment<br>
</ul>
The thesis is the primary component of the degree 
requirements.  The research must lead to an original 
contribution to knowledge in the subject field. The 
research is to be carried out under the direction of the 
candidate's supervisor(s), in cooperation with a Thesis 
Advisory Committee.  The Thesis Advisory Committee 
consists of the student's academic supervisor(s), who 
chairs the committee, and two other professors whose 
areas of expertise are relevant to the thesis investigation.<p>

The Ph.D. program has a scheduled set of examinations 
consistent with a maximum program duration of 48 
months.  The first such examination is the Ph.D. 
Qualifying Examination, which must be held within 12 
months of registration for all candidates starting their 
program in September;  the time limit is 14 months for 
January or May registrants. A Ph.D. seminar must be 
scheduled by the candidate for a date not more than 24 
months after the start of the program.  The student will 
present the completed thesis for examination by a 
departmental committee before the end of the 46th 
month from the start of the Ph.D. program.<p>

Although a Ph.D. candidate will normally hold a Master's 
degree from this or another recognized university, it is 
possible for a Master's candidate to transfer registration 
directly to a Ph.D. program without completing the 
Master's program.  Regulations covering such transfers 
are available from the Graduate Studies Office.

<title> Master of Applied Science (M.A.Sc.)</title>
<h1> Master of Applied Science (M.A.Sc.)</h1>

The Master of Applied Science program is oriented 
toward a career in research. The primary component is 
the Thesis, which reports the results of an independent 
research investigation carried out by the student. The 
M.A.Sc. program is the most appropriate Masters level 
program for those students who intend subsequently to 
pursue a Ph.D. degree.<p>

The M.A.Sc. program requires successful completion of at 
least five graduate half-courses (with a plurality of 
mechanical and industrial engineering courses) and 
successful defense of a Thesis at a M.A.Sc. oral 
examination. Composition of the course program must 
be selected in cooperation with the student's academic 
Supervisor.<p>

The Thesis is the major part of the M.A.Sc. program and 
is carried out under the direction of the candidate's 
Supervisor on the campus of the University of Toronto.  
Upon completion of course requirements and Thesis, the 
candidate will undergo a departmental oral examination.

<title> Master of Engineering (M.Eng.)</title>
<h1> Master of Engineering (M.Eng.)</h1>

The intent of the Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) 
program is to prepare graduate engineers for advanced 
professional practice.  This is accomplished through 
completion of graduate level courses, although many 
students include a project in their program.  The M.Eng. 
program is primarily taken on a part-time basis by 
practicing engineers.<p>
The M.Eng. program requires successful completion of at 
least ten half-courses (with a plurality of mechanical and 
industrial engineering courses) at the graduate level.  
Composition of the course program must be selected in 
cooperation with the student's academic supervisor. A 
Project Report will be accepted in lieu of three half-
courses.<p>
Although M.Eng. degree holders are not normally 
expected to enter a Ph.D. program, they are not barred 
from doing so. M.Eng. students who might eventually 
wish to engage in a Ph.D. program should complete a 3-
credit Project Report designed to demonstrate their 
research abilities, and should include at least two Ph.D. 
core courses in their program of study.

currents) and the subsequent generation of an electric 
potential difference across the interfaces of the 
membranes. Under voltage clamp conditions, the gating 
currents as a function of time can be predicted with SRT.<p>

Recent experimental results indicate that the 
conventional methods for predicting the rate of 
evaporation are inadequate. At the interface of an 
evaporating liquid, it is found experimentally that the 
temperature in the vapor is greater than that of the 
liquid. This is the opposite relation to that predicted by 
the current theories of liquid evaporation. A new theory 
of kinetics, called Statistical Rate Theory, is being applied 
to predict the rate of evaporation and to determine if it 
provides an explanation for the observed temperature 
discontinuity at the interface.<p>

<I>Description for Tour</I><p>
Surface thermodynamics is the study of the interface between adjoining fluids or fluids 
and solids.  In our laboratory, we use digital image analysis to measure surface tension, 
line tension, and  contact angles.  The quantities are important in a wide variety of     
areas including detergents, coating and painting, lubrication, multiphase flow, and heat 
transfer.  In addition, we are applying our techniques to problmes in biomedical 
engineering such the measurement of lung surfactant surface tension, protein 
adsorption, and protein interactions.<p>

Ultrasonic Nondestructive Testing (Main Corridor in  MC)<p>
<I>Description for Tour</I><p>
In the same way that ultrasound can be used by doctors to see the fetus in a pregnant 
woman, engineers use ultrasound to search for flaws and cracks inside engineering 
structures.  Ultrasound pulses are sent into the structure and bounce off defects; the 
echoes are then picked up by a device similar to a microphone.  This technology is in  
widespread use in the transportation, aerospace, nuclear power, and petrochemical 
industries. <p>

<I>Description for Tour</I> <p>
<dir>
<li>  The emission free power supply is constructed of an alkaline fuel cell and a hydrogen storage system.  
The water produced by the power supply is circulated to the hydrogen storage system where it reacts with a
 material to produce hydrogen.  The hydrogen is circulated to the fuel cell where it produces electrical power 
and the water required to sustain the reaction.  The reaction products are retained in the hydrogen storage 
system.<p>
<li> When the gravitational intensity on fluids is reduced to near-zero, surface tension forces control the 
configuration that a fluid adopts.  As a result, fluids held 
in a container adopt some unearthly configurations and some of these can be observed when the fluid is in free fall. 
<p>

<I>Description for Brochure</I> <p>
An emission free power supply for automotive applications; fluid behaviour in microgravity.<p>

Canada has always been active in its involvement with the exceptional child.  From the policy makers at the federal and provincial levels through the teachers in training at the universities and colleges, Canadians have long been working toward the betterment of the exceptional community.  In doing this, Canadian citizens have been involved in The Council for Exceptional Children since its inception.  To date, there are more than 3,000 Canadian CEC members.<P>
The purposes and objectives of Canadian CEC are to advance the general welfare and education of all exceptional children and youth in Canada, to disseminate information regarding exceptional children, to encourage membership in CEC, to coordinate the work of all federations, branches, chapters, and subdivisions of Canadian CEC, to support the quarterly publication <i>Keeping in Touch</i> (distributed to all Canadian CEC members), to cooperate with other Canadian organizations and agencies concerned with exceptional children, to identify areas of concern related to exceptional children in Canada, and to conduct studies and publish reports.<P>
To accommodate some of the unique Canadian needs in CEC, a standing committee known as the Canadian Committee was established more than 20 years ago.  Recent administrative changes resulted in the establishment of the Canadian Council for Exceptional Children.  While remaining an integral part of CEC, the Canadian Council for Exceptional Children has its own Board of Directors.  Each of the ten provinces has representation on the Board.  Canadian student members also have representation on the Board through the Canadian Student Liaison who is elected by the student members of Canada.  <P>
<B>For more information about CEC in Canada</B>, contact:  Bill Gowling, Director, c/o Canadian CEC, 1010 Polytek Court, Unit 36, Gloucester, ON, Canada K1J 9J2, 613/747-9226 or FAX 613/745-9282.<P>

<center><h2>BENEFITS OF STUDENT CEC MEMBERSHIP</h2></center>
 
Why become a member of The Student Council for Exceptional Children?  Student CEC offers many benefits to its members.  You may be aware of some of these benefits, but here are a few to think about.<P>
 CURRENT INFORMATION -- Student CEC provides you with the most current information available on special education issues.  By joining Student CEC you will have access to<I> TEACHING Exceptional Children</I>, <I>Exceptional Children</I>, and <I>CEC Today</I>, all quality publications loaded with information.<BR>
<BR>
 PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT -- Student CEC is a great place for professional development.  State/provincial federations hold annual conferences.  Each division holds an annual conference, and you don't want to miss CEC's annual convention.   By attending these events either as a participant or a presenter, you will further develop yourself as a professional and be prepared to enter the field of special education.<BR>
<BR>
 NETWORKING -- By joining Student CEC you will have the opportunity to network with people from all over.  Involvement starts at the local level as you get involved with your chapter.  You will also have the opportunity to meet with well-respected professionals in your state or province during federation conferences as well as meet up with colleagues at the annual convention. <BR>
<BR>
 DIVISIONS -- By joining one of the 17 divisions, you have access to even more information.  Divisions focus on one area of specialization and will help you get the information you need to be successful in that area.  <BR>
<BR>
 EMPLOYMENT -- Student CEC provides you with access to jobs.  By networking with professionals in your federation or the divisions, you will learn about current jobs.  You can also contact the National Clearinghouse for Professions in Special Education for information on jobs.  And don't forget the Job Fair held each year during the convention.<BR>
<BR>
Over 11,500 students from throughout the United States and Canada belong to Student CEC.  They reap the benefits of membership each and every day.  Think about what you are missing by not joining.  Call 800/845-6232 for more information about membership opportunities or check out the membership section of this web page.<P>
 

<B>Student CEC Structure and Purpose<BR>
</B><BR>
The CEC Delegate Assembly authorized the development of Student CEC 30 year ago.  Student CEC, a program of CEC, is an association for all student members of CEC and is organized on both the state/provincial level and on the international level.  Its primary purpose is to "present students with opportunities to improve educational professional standards and increase awareness of exceptional children and youth," and it is "the focal point for the professional preparation of any student interested in services for exceptional children and youth," (Student CEC Constitution, Article II, Section I).<P>
<B>Student Membership<P>
</B>Anyone interested in the education of exceptional children and youth is welcome to join CEC as either student or regular members.  The student membership category is defined as those who are enrolled at an accredited college or university and not engaged in full-time employment in the education profession.  Students can join at a discounted rate and are entitled to the identical benefits, services, rights, and privileges of regular CEC members.<P>
<B>Student  CEC Chapters<P>
</B>Student chapters are formed at the local level, usually at colleges and universities with special education programs.  Chapters meet on a regular basis and organize programs and activities for and with individuals with exceptionalities.  Seventy-five percent of a Student CEC chapters' membership must be comprised of students, but faculty and professionals may join student chapters.  Students may also join regular chapters if they desire. Click on Student Chapters for a list of colleges and universities with chapters.<P>
<B>Student CEC Governance</B><P>
Every state or province with an organized federation or branch may form an association consisting of the student members in that state or province.  The association's student executive committee works with local Student CEC chapters to provide support and programming.  <P>
Each association may elect a governor to sit on the Student CEC Board of Governors.  The governors meet during the annual CEC convention to address issues relating to Student CEC and the education profession.  They also elect the Student CEC Executive Committee consisting of the President, Vice President of Committees, Vice President of Programs, and Vice President of Communications.  Programming and governance issues are addressed by these four officers.<P>
Finally, students comprise about 20% of CEC's total membership and bring a variety of perspectives and needs to CEC.  In recognition of this, the Student CEC President sits on the CEC Board of Governors.  <p>


<B>THE STRUCTURE OF STUDENT CEC<BR>
<CENTER><BR>
</B><BR>
</CENTER><B>STUDENT CEC MEMBER</B>The Student CEC member is the backbone of the organization.  Student CEC members are interested in the education profession or related services and in working with individuals with exceptionalities. 
<P>
<CENTER> 
</CENTER>[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]<BR>
<CENTER><BR>
</CENTER><B>STUDENT CEC CHAPTERS</B>A student chapter consists of regular and student members.  Chapters can be located on a college or university campus and are a place to share talents, learn leadership skills, and  build relationships with other CEC members, special educators and exceptional children within the community. 
<p>
  <B>DIVISIONS</B>Student CEC members may join 16 of the 17 divisions which specialize in specific exceptionalities.  Joining divisions enables students to tailor their education to particular areas of interest.  Divisions may elect a student governor to sit on the Student CEC Board of Governors.<BR>
<BR>
<B>STUDENT CEC ASSOCIATIONS</B>An association consists of all student members in a particular state or province.  Associations provide programming ideas, coordinate efforts on the state/provincial level and elect officers to act as liaisons between the local Student CEC chapters and the Student CEC Executive Committee.<p>
<B>STUDENT CEC BOARD OF GOVERNORS</B>The Student CEC Board of Governors is made up of governors from every state and province with an organized association as well as from divisions.  Governors meet during the annual convention to share information, plan for the upcoming year, address governance issues and elect the Student CEC Executive Committee.<p>
<B>STUDENT CEC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE</B>The Student CEC Executive Committee consists of four student officers elected to represent all Student CEC members.  These officers plan and implement programming for all members of Student CEC.<p>
<B>THE STUDENT COUNCIL FOR EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN</B>Student CEC was established to provide students with opportunities to improve educational professional standards and is the focal point for professional preparation of any student interested in services for exceptional children and youth.<p>
<B>THE COUNCIL FOR EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN</B>The Council for Exceptional Children is the largest international professional organization dedicated to improving educational outcomes for individuals with exceptionalities - students with disabilities and/or the gifted.   <p>

CONSTITUTION & BYLAWS<BR>
<P>
</B>Chapters are governed by their constitution and bylaws.  This is an important document because it guides your actions as you make decisions.  It informs you about a quorum (how many people it takes to run a meeting); details officer responsibilities;  identifies your purpose; and helps make tough decisions.  <P>
Every chapter should have a constitution and bylaws on file with their chapter.  CEC Headquarters also keeps a copy on file.  <P>
As you prepare for the year, here are some steps to follow to ensure you are governing correctly:<P>
<ol>
<li>     Check to make sure you have a constitution and bylaws on file with your chapter.  <BR>
<BR>
<li>     Check to make sure you have a constitution and bylaws on file with your student activities office on your campus.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     If you can't find your constitution and bylaws, call CEC Headquarters at 800/845-6232 to obtain a copy.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Review your constitution and bylaws.  Most of them were written in the 1970's, so you may have some serious revising to do.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Call CEC Headquarters -- 800/845-6232 -- for a sample copy which you can use as a guide.  It contains all the up-to-date language required by the Delegate Assembly.  <BR>
<BR>
<li>     You must follow the criteria set by the Delegate Assembly when updating or writing your constitution and bylaws.  This means you can always be more detailed in your constitution and bylaws but not less than what is required by the Delegate Assembly.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Once you have revised your constitution and bylaws, share this information with your chapter and vote to approve the changes.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Finally, send your new constitution and bylaws to CEC Headquarters so it can be approved and kept on file in your chapter folder.<BR>
<BR></ol>

<B>CHAPTER REFUNDS</B><BR>
<P>
<B>What is the Purpose of Unit Refunds?</B><P>
CEC has had a long tradition of proving a portion of each member's dues to his/her unit for support of its activities.  It's assumed that the more income a unit can generate without formal fund raising programs, the more time it can spend on member-related benefits and services.<BR>
<B><BR>
How are the Refunds Calculated?<P>
</B>June 30 and December 31 are important dates.  These are the dates when a determination is made regarding how many members within a unit generate the refund for that unit.  The refund for student members is calculated, based on the new or renewing members for the 6-month period, and a check is generated.  Again, it is important to know that the refunds are not calculated based on the member's original unit, but based on where he/she is on June 30 or December 31.  Example:  If a student member pays May 1, the member's refund would print on the August refund.  If a student member pays September 1, the member's refund would print on the February refund.<B><P>
How Much is Refunded for Student Members?<P>
</B>A total of $3.00 per student is refunded for each new membership or renewal.  Of this amount, it is divided as follows:  $2.00/chapter + $.25/federation + $.75/student association.  (If there is no student association for a state/province, the federation receives $1.00 per student member.)  If  a member does not affiliate with a chapter, the total amount is refunded to the federation --  so be sure to list your chapter number on all applications you pass out.<BR>
<B><BR>
When are Refund Checks Mailed?<P>
</B>Checks are mailed on August 15 and February 15 each year to treasurers of active chapters who have reported at least three current officers to CEC Headquarters Membership Program.<BR>
<B><BR>
How do We Know if the Check Amount is Correct?<P>
</B>The check receipt indicates the number of members reflected in the check.  To verify, check the "paid date" of each member on your membership roster (sent to the membership chairs each quarter).  You can closely match the members with paid dates from January-June with the August check or the members with paid dates from July-December with the February check.  The Membership Program staff is always available to answer your questions or to clarify any areas that seem fuzzy.  Feel free to call 800/845-6232, and we will walk you through the process.<P>
 
<B>DELEGATE ASSEMBLY<P>
 
What is the Delegate Assembly? <BR>
</B><BR>
The Delegate Assembly is CEC's legislative body.  It meets annually at the international convention.  President Diane Johnson will preside at all Delegate Assembly meetings in Orlando, FL where representatives from each chapter, branch, federation, and division make important decisions for the Council.  Some issues that delegates address relate to CEC's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws; official Council platforms, statements of policy and resolutions; election of CEC officers; regulations and standards for CEC units; and membership dues.<P>
The Delegate Assembly traditionally holds two meetings during the annual CEC convention. <P>
<B>How Many Delegate Votes Does my Unit Have This Year?<BR>
</B><BR>
The number of votes your unit has this year is based on your total membership as of <B>June 30, 1995</B>.  This number is printed on a computer label found on the enclosed blue Delegate Registration Form which you will receive in December.<P>
<B>When are Delegates Registered?<BR>
</B><BR>
All delegates<B> must be registered by the very strict postmark deadline of February 29, 1996</B>, so please don't delay.  Send your Delegate Registration Form to Credentials and Elections Committee Chairperson Steve Smith (c/o CEC/MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM, 1920 Association Drive, Reston, Virginia 22091) as soon as you can to ensure your unit's representation.  Registration forms postmarked after the February 29 deadline will be returned and will unfortunately make a unit ineligible for participation in the 1996 Delegate Assembly.<P>
<B>Is it Difficult to Register?<BR>
</B><BR>
To register your unit's representative(s), fill out the blue Delegate Registration Form when you receive it in December, and mail it to Steve Smith, CEC/MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM, by February 29.  Be sure, however, that each delegate and each alternate does plan to attend the Orlando Convention on Tuesday and Wednesday, April 2 and 3, and are current CEC members.<P>
<B>Can Delegates/Alternates be Named if They aren't Affiliated with Our Unit?<BR>
</B><BR>
Yes.  It may be that members of your unit are uncertain whether they can secure leave time from their jobs or from their course work to attend the convention.  In such cases, you could name a member from a neighboring chapter, from your federation, or from your division to serve as your delegate or alternate. <p> BE SURE ALL PERSONS REGISTERED ARE CEC MEMBERS IN GOOD STANDING, AND THAT THEY KNOW THEY ARE REGISTERED TO REPRESENT <p>

YOUR UNIT.  They should also know the names of the other delegates and alternates,  how many votes each delegate carries, and the issues to be addressed. <BR>
<BR>
<B>What Should Delegates do at the Convention?<BR>
</B><BR>
In Orlando, your unit's delegate(s) and alternate(s) should:<BR>
<BR><ol>
<li>     Go to the Delegate Credential's Desk located in the Registration Area, in the Orlando Convention Center during the specified times to check in and get unit votes validated.  This is done by stating the unit number and showing a convention badge.  Each delegate or alternate will be given a second badge to wear during the Delegate Assembly.  On the badge will be the number of votes for which the delegate is responsible.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Pick up the Delegate Assembly agenda when validating unit votes.  The agenda contains both action and information items that should be reviewed in advance of the assembly.  If the delegate or alternate has questions about any items, he/she should seek assistance from the federation governor, president, or from a division officer.  CEC staff persons can also answer questions.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Attend all Delegate Assembly sessions, making sure he/she can accurately report the assembly's decisions back home at the next unit meeting.<BR></ol>
<BR>
<B>Until When Can a Delegate or Alternate's Name be Changed?<BR>
</B><BR>
If the CEC Membership Program receives a name change with a postmark date of February 29, 1996 or earlier, the change will be honored.  After February 29, only those persons registered will be eligible to participate in the Delegate Assembly.<P>
<B>Is There a Checklist to Keep all of This Straight?<BR>
</B><BR>
A checklist will be sent to all unit presidents along with the Delegate Assembly Registration Form in December.  The checklist reviews much of this information and provides a valuable reminder of your obligations as delegate.<P>
<B>What Happens if I Don't Receive Any Information in December?</B><P>
Only chapters who have reported their officers are eligible for Delegate Assembly votes.  If your chapter has not reported its officers, information regarding the Delegate Assembly will not be sent to your chapter in December.<P>

 STARTING A STUDENT CEC CHAPTER 
<P>
How to Start a Student CEC Chapter<P>
</B>Starting a chapter is easy.  Just follow these three steps<P>
<ol>
<li>     Call CEC Headquarters -- 800/845-6232 and order a chapter start-up kit.  This kit contains everything you need to get your chapter started.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Once you get the kit, look it over and do the following:<BR>
 Find 15 people to join your chapter.  These can be new members or current members who want to transfer into your chapter.  At least 75% of your members must be students.  The rest can be professors or other professionals.  <BR>
 Hold a meeting.  Set your goals for the year and elect officers.<BR>
 Complete the chapter application form listing your officers.<BR>
 Create a constitution to govern your chapter.  You can use the sample constitution and fill in the blanks or create your own.              <BR>
<BR>
<li>     Send the completed chapter application, constitution, and all membership applications and transfer forms to CEC Headquarters at 1920 Association Drive, Reston, VA 22091.  Once we receive your packet, we will assign your chapter a number and approve your constitution.<BR></ol>
<BR>
<B>Why Start A Student CEC Chapter<P>
</B>There are many benefits to starting a Student CEC Chapter on your campus.  Here are some to consider:<P>
 Chapters provide students with the opportunity to gather together to network and learn from one another.  Chapters can conduct make-it-take-it workshops, invite in speakers, or hold discussions on areas of concern such as discipline, inclusion, or curriculum development.<BR>
<BR>
 Chapters conduct community service.  Student CEC chapters can plan activities for persons with disabilities and or those who are gifted.  This provide a mutual benefit since most organizations need willing volunteers and preprofessionals need experience.<BR>
<BR>
 Chapters allow colleagues to benefit from professional development.  Students can plan programs for the chapter or attend state/provincial conferences and the national convention.<BR>
<BR>
Chapters do a wide variety of activities.  For more information, check out the Student CEC Chapter Idea Page or call 800/845-6232.  Karen Vermaire Fox will be happy to help you get your chapter up and running.<p>

Whenever the groups meet, they brainstorm fund raising ideas, share experiences, and discuss responsibilities connected with the education of not only students and their parents, but also the professionals in the field in order to have optimum achievement for both students and teachers.<P>
Oklahoma Student CEC offers a lavish thank you to Karen Vermaire Fox, Dr. Ben Harper, Darleen Griffin, and Teresa Loudermilk.  Your support, dedication, and motivation was truly an inspiration.  Thank you.  Be well my friends.<P>

CONSTITUTION & BYLAWS<BR>
<BR>
 
</B>Associations are governed by their constitution and bylaws.  This is an important document because it guides your actions as you make decisions.  It informs you about a quorum (how many people it takes to run a meeting); details officer responsibilities;  identifies your purpose; and helps make tough decisions.  <P>
Every association should have a constitution and bylaws on file with their association.  CEC Headquarters also keeps a copy on file.  <P>
As you prepare for the year, here are some steps to follow to ensure you are governing correctly:<P><ol>
<li>     Check to make sure you have a constitution and bylaws on file with your association.  <BR>
<BR>
<li>     Check to make sure you have a constitution and bylaws on file with your federation.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     If you can't find your constitution and bylaws, call CEC Headquarters at 800/845-6232 to obtain a copy.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Review your constitution and bylaws.  Most of them were written in the 1970's, so you may have some serious revising to do.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Call CEC Headquarters -- 800/845-6232 -- for a sample copy you can use as a guide.  This sample contains all the up-to-date language required by the Delegate Assembly.  <BR>
<BR>
<li>     You must follow the criteria set by the Delegate Assembly when updating or writing your constitution and bylaws.  This means you can always be more detailed in your constitution and bylaws but not less than what is required by the Delegate Assembly.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Once you have revised your constitution and bylaws, share this information with your association and vote to approve the changes.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Finally, send your new constitution and bylaws to CEC Headquarters so it can be approved and kept on file in your association folder.<BR>

STUDENT INVOLVEMENT IN CAN</B> 
<P>
<B>What is CAN?</B><P>
CEC is committed to the effective implementation and expansion of public policy in the interest of children and youth with disabilities, those who are gifted, and the profession that serves this population.  CEC leads the way in advocating for individuals with exceptionalities and in improving the conditions and resources available to the educator. CEC pioneered the passage of P.L. 94-142 and continues to fight hard for key legislative wins relative to exceptional individuals.  Public policy legislation, litigation, appropriation, regulation, and agreements are the means by which individuals with exceptionalities are guaranteed the educational opportunities of our society.  This message is amplified by CEC's active political action network.<P>
The Children and Youth Action Network -- CAN -- is the active political action network of CEC, and we welcome your involvement.  We need student involvement in public policy, so that lawmakers on all levels are made aware of the issues facing children and youth with exceptionalities.<P>
<B>How Can I Get Involved?</B><P>
CEC welcomes your involvement on any level.  Both Student CEC chapters and associations are encouraged to elect a CAN Coordinator to serve on their executive committees.   The basic responsibilities of the CAN Coordinator are as follows:<P><ol>
<li>     Maintain contact with the federation CAN Coordinator and receive CAN updates.<BR>
<li>     Become familiar with current governmental issues.<BR>
<li>     Provide reports on legislation and other key policy issues at all meetings.<BR>
<li>     Get students involved in the political process to help support key issues concerning special education.<BR></ol>
<BR>
CAN Coordinators elected to state/provincial associations have the opportunity to attend a public policy workshop in the summer.  This workshop is designed to prepare CAN Coordinators to better do their jobs.  Training is also offered at the annual convention.<P>
If you are interested in learning more about public policy, check out the public policy section of this web page.  If you would like more information about trainings or leadership positions, contact Karen Vermaire Fox at CEC Headquarters.  Call her at 800/845-6232 or send an e-mail to karenv@cec.sped.org.<P>

<B>THE STUDENT CEC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE<BR>
<BR>
</B> 
<B>The Make-up of the Student CEC Executive Committee</B><BR>
<BR>
The Student CEC Executive Committee consists of 5 officers: President, Vice President of Committees, Vice President of Programs, Vice President of Communications, and Canadian Student Liaison (CSL).  The CSL is a nonvoting member of the Committee.   <P>
<B>The Responsibilities of the Student CEC Executive Committee</B><P>
<B>Kristy P&eacute;rez</B>,  a graduate student at Texas A&M University, is the Student CEC President.  While fulfilling the role of president, Kristy also represents Student CEC on the CEC Board of Governors and on the Finance and Operations Committee.  In her spare time, she serves as the CAN Coordinator for Student CEC.  Ultimately, her leadership affects everything from communication, to recruitment and retention, to the actualization of the Student CEC action plan.  <BR>
The Vice President of Committees is <B>Samantha Sexton</B>, an undergraduate student at the University of Winnipeg in Manitoba .  Samantha oversees the Student CEC standing committees, the steering committee, and the Region Chairs.  She works with each committee to ensure that they are accomplishing their various tasks.  With the new action plan in place, the committees and the Region Chairs have their work cut out for them.<P>
<B>Cheryl Turner</B> is the Vice President of Programs. She is in charge of planning the student segment of CEC's annual convention happening in Orlando, FL on April 1-5, 1996.  Besides working to secure presenters for various student sessions, Cheryl plans the Welcome to Orlando Icebreaker, the Student CEC dance, and all the other convention activities.  In the meantime, she is getting her degree in special education at Harris Stowe State College in St. Louis, MO.  <P>
The Vice President of Communications, <B>Kimberly Garvis</B>,  is an undergraduate student at Providence College in Rhode Island.  Kimberly is responsible for a myriad of activities: she takes minutes; chairs the Publications Committee; writes and edits articles for <I>CEC Today</I>; and promotes Student CEC activities in CEC publications.  Send your news to Kim.<P>
<B>Allan Balitian</B>, is serving as the Canadian Student Liaison.  This is the first time the CSL has  been a member of the Student CEC Executive Committee and we are excited to welcome him on board.  He will be communicating with chapters and associations in Canada and working with the Student CEC Executive Committee to strengthen Student CEC and Canadian CEC relationships.  Allan is working towards his ministry certification at the University of  Toronto.<P>
<B>The Election of the Student CEC Executive Committee</B><BR>
<BR>
The officers are elected each year at CEC's annual convention and serve a 1 year term.<BR>
<B><BR>

STUDENT CEC COMMITTEES 
<P>
The Definition, Role, and Make-up of Student CEC Committees<BR>
<BR>
</B>Committees play a very important role in Student CEC.  Their duties include finding more effective ways to recruit and retain members, selecting Student CEC award winners, promoting ethnic and multicultural concerns, and writing articles for Student CEC publications.<P>
There are two different types of committees managed by Student CEC.  They are standing committees and ad hoc committees.  Standing committees are permanent committees which report to the Student CEC Executive Committee and the Student CEC Board of Governors annually.  Ad hoc committees are set up at the discretion of the Student CEC Executive Committee or the Student CEC Board of Governors to investigate and study specific situations or subjects.  Once an ad hoc committee completes its task and reports its findings, it is dissolved.<P>
Student members are encouraged to get involved with a committee.  Contact Samantha Sexton, VP of  Committees, or the committee chair if you are interested in working on a committee.<BR>
<B><BR>
Student CEC Honors Committee<BR>
<BR>
</B>The main goal of this committee is to solicit nominations from the field for the Outstanding Student CEC Member of the Year Award and the Student CEC Graduation Award.  Both  graduate and undergraduate Student CEC members are chosen for each award.   Reading all the nominations and selecting the winners are the largest responsibilities.  This year the committee will also create a presentation on CEC's standards of practice.<P>
Kathie Good (NM) is the chair of the Student CEC Honors Committee and the committee members are Florence Bissola (ON), Todd Catanzano (VT), Kathleen Cutler (NY), Lori Lange (MN), Meredith Lintner (KY), and Jennifer Simpson (NC).<BR>
 <B><BR>
Student CEC Membership Committee<P>
</B>The Membership Committee promotes recruitment and retention efforts, oversees the Annual Association Membership Contest, and provides support for the membership months and  membership awards.  This year the committee will promote the Each One Reach One campaign  for use during the October membership month.  They will also research the use of electronic communication as a means of promoting Student CEC.<P>
The Student CEC Membership Committee chair is Amy Ansley (FL), and the members are Darrell Dean (LA), Karen Leroux (ON), Connie Pickett (MS), and Heather Swain (NC).<BR>
<B><BR>
Student CEC Ethnic and Multicultural Concerns Committee<P>
</B>This committee was created to serve as a resource to Student CEC chapters and associations with activities that promote an awareness of ethnic and multicultural concerns.  The chair of this committee helps select the Student CEC/FEC Ethnic Diversity Scholarship recipient as well.  The committee will also create a handbook for Multicultural and Ethnic Diversity Month.<P>
Mary Ann Pearson (NM) is the chair of the Student CEC Ethnic and Multicultural Concerns Committee, and the members of the committee are Jennifer Faukner (CA), Brenda Lopez Rodriguez (PR), Henry Marcet (FL), and Tinhai Vong (MB).<BR>
<B><BR>
Student CEC Publications Committee<P>
</B>Members of this committee will work closely with Kimberly Garvis, the Vice President of Communications, to develop articles for the Student CEC pages in <I>CEC Today</I>, and compile ideas for the<I> Student CEC Activity Idea Book</I>.  <P>
The chair is Kimberly Garvis (RI) and the committee members are Allan Balitian (ON), Judy Barry (RI), Sandie Benz (NY), Todd Catanzano (VT), Margaret Heskett (ME), Mark David Hurte (KY), Elaine Hutcheson (VA), Michelle Klei (FL), Vivian Lasley (KY), Idalis Negr&oacute;n (PR), Karen Nespoli (NY), Diane Noon (CA), and Mariela Ramos (PR).<B><P>
Student CEC Action Plan Ad Hoc Committee<P>
</B>To establish an effective action plan for the next three years, the 1995 Student CEC Board of Governors created an ad hoc committee to research, write, and present a Student CEC action plan  from 1996-1999 to both Student CEC and CEC governors.  The action plan will move Student CEC towards the 21st century and ensure that Student CEC works collaboratively with CEC.<P>
Mark Kandel (DLD) is the chair of the Student CEC Action Plan Ad Hoc Committee, and the members are Adrienne Blumenthal (NS), Tina Hoopingarner (MRDD), DeAnn Lechtenberger (TX), Heather Tindall (MT), and Cheri Weyrich (NM). <BR>
<B><BR>
Student CEC Transition Ad Hoc Committee<BR>
</B><BR>
Student CEC members eventually make the transition from student to professional membership, but during that first year out in the "real world" CEC membership dues aren't often a priority.  The Student CEC Board of Governors created a 3 year ad hoc committee to establish a transition plan and to  a mentoring program for Student CEC and CEC members.  The committee is made up of professional and student members committed to developing effective transition programs.<P>
The chair of the Student CEC Transition Ad Hoc Committee is Heather McCartt (IN) and the committee members are Jerry Ammer (CA), Heather Baumann (IL), Sheri&eacute; Campbell (FL), Phyllis Froese (MB), and Mayra Gonz&aacute;lez Garcia (PR).<B><BR>

<B>Yes I' m Interested -- What is the Election Process?<BR>
</B><BR>
<ol>
<li>     Obtain a petition packet from the Coordinator of Student Activities -- Call 800/845-6232.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Send your petition packet, postmarked <B> by February 16,</B> to CEC Headquarters and make plans to attend the annual CEC convention.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     The following two phase screening process will be used in the event that more than 6 candidates petition for one office:  <BR><ol type=a>
<li>     Each governor receives a packet containing the petition of each prospective candidate to share with students within the governor's state or province.<BR>
<li>     Governors rank-order the petitions and return them to CEC Headquarters.  <BR>
<li>     The field of petitioners is reduced to a maximum of 6 candidates and 1 alternate for each office.  An alternate becomes a candidate only if a candidate officially withdraws from the ballot before the formal interview of candidates for that office.  <BR>
<li>     This screening does not occur if 6 or less candidates petition for the same office.<BR></ol>
<BR>
<li>     Once the petition is received, a letter of recommendation from an academic or Student CEC faculty advisor is requested and held confidential.  It is added to the respective candidate's packet to be studied by the Student Board of Governors at the annual meeting.  <BR>
<BR>
<li>     One or two days prior to the official start of the convention, candidates meet with the Student CEC Executive Committee to answer last-minute questions.  Candidates then visit with the governors and other students on an informal basis at the Meet and Greet the Candidates Icebreaker.  Each candidate will have the opportunity to express his or her reasons for seeking office. <BR>
<BR>
<li>     During the Student CEC Board of Governors' meeting, a formal interview of the candidates is conducted by the Student CEC Board of Governors.  The candidate must:<BR><ol type=a>
<li>     be prepared to give a 5 minute speech which could include personal information, reasons for wanting to hold an office, and intended objectives while in office.<BR>
<li>     be prepared to answer questions posed by governors following the 5 minute speech.<BR></ol>
The question period lasts about 15 minutes and consists of some pre-prepared questions..  <BR>
<BR>
<li>     The governors then review each candidate individually.  The candidates are not present at this meeting.  The procedure followed for review of candidates is:<BR><ol type=a>
<li>     One round of positive comments by the governors for each candidate for each office.<BR>
<li>     One round of negative comments by the governors for each candidate for each office.<BR>
<li>     Discussion of all candidates for each office.<BR>
<li>     Voting by secret ballot for each office (each governor and executive committee member has one vote).<BR>
<li>     If no candidate for a particular office is elected by majority vote after 3 ballots, the election process is passed to the Student CEC Steering Committee.<BR>
<li>     The Student CEC Steering Committee caucuses with the governors in each region and compiles a list of potential candidates for the office.<BR>
<li>     The Student CEC Steering Committee discusses and ranks the list of candidates.  This is also done in the event that no petitions are received for a particular office.  The 3 candidates receiving the highest ranking for each vacant office are interviewed during a joint meeting of the Student CEC Steering and Executive Committees.<BR>
<li>     After considering all of the candidates, the Student CEC Steering and Executive Committees vote for an individual to fill the office.  Simple majority vote rules.<BR></ol>
<BR>
<li>     Each officer meets individually with the candidates(s) for his/her office to inform them of the election results after the vote has taken place, or the candidates are notified by phone.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     If elected, it is recommended that the candidate attend the convention from the beginning of the election process (informal interviews) through the final day of convention.  Many activities will take place which require the attendance of the newly elected officers.<BR></ol>
<BR>
<B>Campaigning</B><P>
Due to the nature of the election process, and because of the inappropriateness of normal "campaign procedures," buttons, posters, and other campaign items will not be allowed at the convention.  Correspondence with any or all of the Student CEC governors is allowed prior to arrival at the convention.<P>
<BR>

<B>THE STUDENT CEC ELECTION CHECKLIST</B>  
<P>
Members of the Student CEC Board of Governors should take their role in the student election very seriously.  They must understand the importance of their judgement criteria, as well as remember that during the formal interviews, their role is to LISTEN rather than talk.  Also, it is crucial that each governor listen critically but evaluate every candidate in a positive manner.<P>
This checklist was created to aid governors in assessing the qualifications of candidates as well as help candidates evaluate their qualifications.   Use it to formulate observations and questions.<P>

<B><BR>
Meet and Greet:  Candidate and Governor Icebreaker</B><P>
Early in the convention week, Student CEC governors, candidates petitioning for the Student CEC Executive Committee, and any other interested Student CEC members should plan to get together for an icebreaker.  Governors will have the opportunity to meet their fellow board members, greet the candidates, and get to know each other in a fun, enjoyable atmosphere.  We hope you will be able to make it.<P>
<B>The Student CEC Board of Governors' Meeting<BR>
</B><BR>
The Student CEC Board of Governors meets early in the convention week (contact CEC Headquarters for dates). The election of the Student CEC Executive Committee occurs at this time.  Other issues of current interest are addressed at this time.  All students are welcome to observe the meeting.<P>
The purpose of the Student CEC  Board of Governors' meeting is to set policy for Student CEC, to share information, and to elect the Student CEC Executive Committee.  A certified student representative from every state or province with an organized association should plan to attend.    If a governor is unable to attend, an alternate can be designated to attend in the governor's place.  Division governors should plan to attend as well, as they are an official part of the Student CEC.<P>
 
<B> 
The Student CEC "Welcome to the Convention City" Icebreaker </B><P>
The Student Icebreaker is an excellent activity to meet your fellow Student CEC members!   Be ready to play some games, swap a T-shirt with someone you don't know, and display your chapter and association wares.  DON'T FORGET YOUR T-SHIRT.<P>

<B><BR>
The Purpose of CEC Clubs<P>
</B>The overall purpose of CEC Clubs is to promote future leaders in the education of children and youth with exceptionalities as well as promote programs designed to inform students of special education and to encourage them to become involved with their peers with the possible result of becoming a part of the profession of special education in the future.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Benefits of Starting a CEC Club</B><BR>
<BR>
Consider the benefits of  starting a CEC Club. Check those that apply to your situation:<P>
<B>_     Recruit future special education teachers</B> -- Future professionals in the field of special education are recruited through CEC clubs.  Club members gain experience and knowledge about special education which may direct their future goals. <BR>
<BR>
<B>_     Build Peer Relationships</B> -- CEC Clubs provide students with an avenue to modify the perceptions they have of their peers.  As club members work on projects and learning activities, they become more aware of the abilities and similarities they have with their peers.  Students in these inclusive environments build self-esteem, socialize, and make friends.<BR>
<BR>
<B>_     Provide Community Service</B> -- Working to inform the community of the Americans with Disabilities Act or to make restaurants, parks, entertainment facilities and city buildings more accessible to all citizens, allows Club members to become community advocates.<BR>
<BR>
<B>_     Enhance Educational Outcomes</B> -- Serving as peer partners provides mutual benefits to Club members and their partners as they learn, work, and play together.   Students involved in peer partner programs develop positive attitudes towards themselves, others, and their school and home environments because they are finding a sense of  belonging.<BR>
<BR>
<B>_     Foster Public Awareness</B> -- Planning and implementing projects and activities creates public awareness and enhance the image of special education.  Holding a disability awareness day, learning about individuals with exceptionalities, and making and supporting friends with disabilities all help to create advocates who value the abilities and diversity of their peers.<BR>
<B><BR>
Starting a CEC Club</B><BR>
<BR>
A CEC Club is easy to start up.  All it requires is some planning and the support of all involved.  Follow these steps and you'll be on your way.<P>
1.     Seek approval from school administration and the special education department.<BR>
2.     Identify a club advisor or sponsoring team.<BR>
3.     Contact CEC Headquarters for an Organizational Kit<BR>
4.     Recruit a minimum of ten members.<BR>
5.     Submit application and constitution to CEC Headquarters.<BR>
7.     Begin your year.<BR>
Should you run into road blocks along the way, the Coordinator of Student Activities at CEC Headquarters is available to provide you with resources, programming ideas and general guidance.  Call 800/845-6232 for more information.  <BR>
<B><BR>
Support For CEC Clubs</B><BR>
<BR>
CEC Clubs became part of The Council for Exceptional Children in 1975 at the CEC Delegate Assembly.  From 1975-1980 there were nine clubs. The support for CEC Clubs sparked in 1989 when the Ohio Department of Special Education provided a grant to develop Project Support, a program to train high school students to become peer tutors.  Since then, the number of clubs has grown rapidly.  In 1990 there were 16 clubs and in August 1993 there were 40 clubs.  Currently, these clubs are located in nine different states and include approximately 900 members.<P>
The Council for Exceptional Children is the largest international organization that advocates for students with disabilities as well as those who are gifted and talented.  CEC has approximately 53,000 members and more than 11,500 of these are college students who have chosen a career in special education.  Many are interested in working with CEC Club members.<P>
CEC provides the latest information in the field of special education, advocates for students with special needs, and actively recruits and retains professionals in the field of special education.  This is not all that CEC has to offer, but these are three areas where CEC can enhance it Clubs.<P>
<B>CEC has the latest information in special education.</B>  Through <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children</I> and <I>CEC Today</I>, club members can discover activities that are being sponsored on college campuses, what first-year teachers are saying about their experiences in the classroom, what other CEC Clubs are doing, and how they can promote accessibility within their school.<P>
<B>CEC advocates for students with special needs.</B>  Through one-on-one and group experiences with individuals with exceptionalities, CEC Club members will discover the abilities, similarities, and the importance of acceptance and inclusion of exceptional individuals.   As friendships are established, club members will feel more confident when promoting disability awareness to their peers and begin to include and support students with exceptionalities. <P>
<B>CEC recruits and retains professionals in the field of special education.</B>  As you may know from your own involvement with special education, volunteering and hands on experience is important.  CEC is involved with the National Clearinghouse for Professions in Special Education which has developed a number of resource sheets on various aspects of special education, along with resources in financial assistance, university training programs, and volunteer experiences.  Club members can stay involved in CEC as they enter college -- there are approximately 340 college and university CEC chapters.  Students do not have to be preparing for a special education career to join Student CEC.<P>
Affiliating with an international program will give your club validity.  There will be many other local and state/provincial level programs with similar activities.  By becoming involved with CEC and setting professional goals and objectives, people will begin to understand the value of a club and the benefits offered to student members.  Your CEC Club will also have the opportunity to be included in CEC state/provincial-sponsored programs.

You are invited to become a member of The Council for Exceptional 
Children (CEC), the largest international professional organization 
dedicated to improving educational outcomes for individuals with 
exceptionalities.  If you are committed to creating positive change in 
the lives of those who have disabilities and/or are gifted, CEC 
membership offers you a wide range of personal and professional benefits you can't
afford to be without.<P>
As a CEC member, you receive:<P>  
<ul><li> <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children</I>, a classroom-oriented magazine that
reports on the latest methods, materials, and programs.<p>
<li><I>Exceptional Children</I>, a research journal that gives you an early 
look at the findings and trends that will change both thinking and 
practice in the years ahead.<P> 
<li><I>CEC Today, </I>a member newsletter that provides news on special 
education at the local, state/provincial, national and international levels.</ul> <P> 

When you join CEC, you also gain access to an active network of more than 52,000
members strong who are special education teachers, administrators, college faculty,
education consultants, students, and parents.  It is easy to connect with others who
face the same challenges that you do.  Whether you are seeking answers to tough
professional problems, or just want to relax with people who understand what you go
through each day, CEC membership puts you in touch with colleagues and friends in
your local area. <p>

CEC helps you boost your skills with networking and career development opportunities.
Members attend CEC professional development programs at special rates, and receive
early notice and special invitations to the annual international conventions, topical
conferences, and workshops. The CEC Annual Convention alone features more than
650 sessions.  Special projects managed by CEC provide essential training programs,
materials, planning, and continuing education opportunities. <P>

Only CEC membership affords the opportunity to join one or more of the <a href="/dv-menu.htm">17 CEC Divisions </a>, allowing members to tailor participation to their
particular area(s) of expertise.  CEC Divisions publish their own journals and
newsletters, and offer a variety of unique activities and workshops, as well as sessions
at the CEC Annual Convention. <P>

As a CEC member, you advocate for the rights of children and youth with
exceptionalities, as well as the special needs of those who teach them.  CEC's
volunteer activists and Headquarters staff are the major voice in Congress, the courts,
and the U.S. Department of Education.  CEC was instrumental in passing such
important legislation as The Education for All Handicapped Children Act (presently
known as IDEA), the Javits Gifted and Talented Students Act, and The Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA).   <P>

The professional resources, discounts, and
career advancement opportunities CEC dues bring are priceless and translate to just
pennies a day!

<h2>About CEC Publications</h2>
</B></U><BR>
<B>What is CEC?</B><br>     The Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) is the largest international professional organization dedicated to improving educational outcomes for individuals with exceptionalities (students with disabilities and/or the gifted).  CEC advocates for appropriate governmental policies, sets professional standards, provides continual professional development, advocates for newly and historically underserved individuals with exceptionalities, and helps professionals obtain conditions and resources necessary for effective professional practice. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Services 
Provided</B> <BR>Professional development opportunities and resources.<BR>
               17 divisions for specialized information.     <BR>
               Journals and newsletters with information on new research findings,   classroom practices that  work, federal legislation, and policies.<BR>
Conventions and conferences.<BR>
               Special education publications.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Philosophy</B><br>     The Publications Program of The Council for Exceptional Children is designed to support its mission through a variety of print and nonprint channels. The mission statement says:<BR>
The worldwide mission of The Council for Exceptional Children is to improve the educational outcomes for individuals with exceptionalities.  CEC, a nonprofit association, accomplishes its mission, which is carried out in support of special education professionals and others working on behalf of individuals with exceptionalities, by advocating for appropriate governmental policies, setting professional standards, providing continuing professional development, and helping professionals achieve the conditions and resources necessary for effective professional practice.<BR>
<BR>
Because CEC's fundamental mission is to improve educational outcomes for individuals with exceptionalities, CEC must be an active force for assuring that there is a highly qualified cadre of professionals with the knowledge, skills, resources, and conditions necessary to practice effectively. CEC's Publications Program supports this mission through a coordinated effort with its policy, standards, and training components.<BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
Readership</B> <br> CEC's publications are targeted to appeal to all segments of the population that deal with the education of children and youth with exceptionalities. Teachers, administrators, students, parents, related support service providers, and members of the higher education and research community are all among our audiences. Our publications are used by both special educators and general educators as well as government and legislative officials, psychologists, pediatricians, and community leaders. <BR>
<P>
<B>Publications</B><br> CEC provides the following publishing options:<BR>
<I>               Exceptional Children<BR>
               TEACHING Exceptional Children<BR>
CEC Today<BR>
</I>               Books and nonprint media<BR>
<BR>
<I>Exceptional Children</I> is published four times per year.  Its focus is on original research on the education and development of exceptional infants, toddlers, children, and youth, as well as articles on professional issues of concern to special educators.  The journal welcomes manuscripts reflecting qualitative or quantitative methodologies using group or single subject research designs.  Articles appropriate for publication include data-based research, data-based position papers, research integration papers, and systematic analyses of policy or practice. <BR>
<BR>
<I>TEACHING Exceptional Children</I>, published six times per year, is a journal designed specifically for teachers, administrators, and other practitioners who work with children and youth with disabilities or who are gifted. Articles that deal with practical methods and materials for classroom use are featured.  While not research oriented, this journal welcomes those databased descriptions that specify techniques, equipment, and procedures for teachers' application.  A feature of <I>TEC</I> is the Special Focus Section.  Articles in this section are generally solicited from professionals who are known to be working in the area.  Procedures are in place to encourage new authors to write for <I>TEC</I>.<BR>
<BR>
<I>CEC Today</I>, is published 10 times per year and is designed to provide up-to-date news to members. This newsletter is only available to CEC members and is considered a member benefit. It provides opportunities for authors to express their views in its regular "Speaking Out" section, which features viewpoints on current issues of concern.<B>     <BR>
<BR>
</B>Books and nonprint media include print, video, audio, diskette, CD-ROM, or combinations of these components. Products developed or selected for distribution through CEC are chosen to support a broad but well-defined set of objectives and meet the criteria of our mission.<BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
Contractual 
Agreements</B> <br>     Authors of all articles published by CEC are required to sign agreement forms and transfer ownership rights; formal contracts are drawn up for books and monographs. These cover any royalties, agreed-upon subsidy arrangements, the author's free copy entitlement and standard discount, transfer of rights to CEC, initial guaranteed distribution, and subsidiary rights.<BR>
<BR>

<h2>Books and Media Program</h2>
<BR>
<B>Types of Products</B><BR> CEC publishes and distributes products designed to help practitioners work more effectively in the classroom including effective teaching strategies and curriculum materials. CEC also publishes training materials in the form of self-contained workshops including supportive media, assessment tools, analysis products on emerging trends and issues, special education policy documents, and other products that support professional standards of practice.<BR>
<BR>
CEC's publication niche is structured around eight areas of knowledge and skills which include: <P>
  1. Philosophical, Historical, and Legal Foundations of Special                      Education <BR>
  2. Characteristics of Learners<BR>
  3. Assessment, Diagnosis, and Evaluation<BR>
  4. Instructional Content and Practice<BR>
  5. Planning and Managing the Teaching and Learning Environment<BR>
  6. Managing Student Behavior and Social Interaction Skills<BR>
  7. Communication and Collaborative Partnerships<BR>
  8. Professionalism and Ethical Practices<BR>
<BR>
CEC aims to maintain a balance between products that will be of high interest to many individuals who work with students with exceptionalities, and those that will serve fewer educators who have more focused information needs.  We also try to maintain a balance between products priced to meet the needs of individual purchasers, with higher priced product packages that will be used by whole schools or programs.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>Submissions</B> <BR>    CEC has an open submissions policy and seeks manuscripts and media from the field on a wide variety of issues. We seek to publish original work that is easy to read and understand but at the same time is supported by research or empirical evidence beyond the author's opinion or experience. Although many of CEC's publications are used as supplemental texts in preservice and inservice training, CEC is not a major publisher of textbooks. CEC does not publish biographies, poetry, or
 fiction.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Authors are encouraged to be mindful that the purpose of CEC's publications program is not to publish all manuscripts that have merit but to select those that provide a unique contribution to the knowledge and practice base. The manuscript must conform to our editorial specifications and must be fiscally sound (cost effective to produce and marketable after the fact).  <BR>
<BR>
Before sending a manuscript or media product to CEC, authors are encouraged to send a proposal so that a determination can be made whether the proposed product will fit into our current publication plan. All proposals should be submitted to CEC with a cover letter that gives a brief summary of the author's expertise with the subject matter and a statement describing who the product is directed to, teachers, administrators, teachers in training. The proposal itself should be two to four pages in length, and should include details of the major topics or contents of each chapter or section.  Significant illustrations, figures, tables, or appendices should be described as part of the proposal.  Authors should also indicate the stage of development of the product, for example, is there a completed manuscript or media product, or has nothing yet been written or produced? The following questions should be used to guide your proposal:<BR>
<BR>
  1.  What is the general topic area(s) of your proposed product?<BR>
<BR>
  2.  How does the topic fit CEC's Knowledge and Skills?<BR>
<BR>
  3.  Who is the primary audience?<BR>
<BR>
  4.  What do you want them to learn?<BR>
<BR>
  5.  Why do you think there is a need for the product?<BR>
<BR>
  6.  What products are already available on this topic? How is yours              different?<BR>
<BR>
  7.  What is the source of the content?<BR>
<BR>
  8.  How will people use the product  (curriculum, reference, training            material)?<BR>
<BR>
  9. Why would CEC be the best publisher/disseminator for this                    product?<BR>
<P>
<B>Review Process</B><BR>          Once a product idea has been accepted and a manuscript or media product has been submitted, it goes through a blind review process (that is, the author's identity is unknown to the reviewers). Typically, three reviewers with expertise in the areas addressed by the manuscript are asked to review the manuscript.   Reviewers will evaluate the material on the basis of the importance of the topic, clarity, accuracy and validity of the content, value of the contribution to the professional literature, implications for special education, quality of the writing, attention to cultural and linguistic equity, and market potential.<BR>
<BR>
If a manuscript or media product has already been developed, the author will be requested to forward four copies, printed double-spaced, to CEC to be sent out for review.  The field review process takes approximately 2 to 3 months.  In addition to the field review, a financial analysis is done to estimate the costs of development and production as well as the marketability of the potential product.  Also determined at this stage is the proposed format and the projected price that will have to be charged, 
based on development and production costs. <p>

The recommendations of the reviewers are considered by the Director of Publications who makes a decision to (a) decline the opportunity to publish, (b) request a revision with a stipulation for further peer review, (c) request a revision subject to approval by CEC staff, or (d) accept as is. If the reviews are positive, and if the product can be priced competitively, CEC will approach the author with a publishing proposal.  If the proposal represents an idea for a product that has not yet been developed, 
the process would take a different route with details negotiated on a case-by-case bases.<p>

Generally, a manuscript goes through several stages of revision before it becomes a finished product.  Reviewers' comments and our own editorial judgments shape the product for maximum marketability.  Often title, format, and organizational changes are necessary.  CEC staff works closely with authors throughout the revision process.  The revised version of the product must be delivered to CEC on disk with two paper copies.<P>

<B>Publishing Options</B> <BR>   CEC offers many different publishing options including royalty agreements.  The most common royalty agreement provides a 10% royalty based on the net income from sales of the product.  An option is also available for authors to donate a portion of their royalties back to CEC as a charitable contribution. <P>

<B>Products Developed by Projects</B><BR> CEC is the host agency for a number of federally-funded projects.  Many of these projects are required to produce products.  CEC acts as the publisher for these products, and they are held to the same standards of accountability as all other products.  One difference between products developed by projects and those initiated by CEC rests in the relationship with the author(s).  Projects are free to negotiate whatever arrangement they wish with authors, including a set-fee payment for work, delivery of an agreed-upon number of free copies of the finished product to the author or collaborating agency, etc. <p>

Products developed by projects not housed at CEC are also encouraged to submit products to CEC for further development or distribution.  If a project believes their product may be suitable for inclusion in CEC's product line, it can be submitted to CEC and it will be considered in the same way as other potential products.  Projects that would like CEC's input during the planning stages of product development should contact CEC's Director of Publications to discuss the possibilities.<BR>
<P>
<B>Products Developed by CEC Divisions</B><BR>     
CEC is the parent organization for 17 divisions.  Each division has some kind of publishing program and several have long-standing, totally independent publishing operations.  Often, however, divisions work collaboratively with CEC to produce a publication of interest to a broader audience than can be reached by the division alone.  In such cases, CEC generally acts as the publisher and the division acts as the author.  Procedures outlined above are generally followed regarding product development, review, and author agreements, although other options may certainly be negotiated.
    In its attempt to meet the needs of CEC members and other regular product purchasers, CEC occasionally selects products for its catalog produced by other publishers. In such cases, products are subject to the same review process as other proposed products.  Catalogs of other publishers are reviewed regularly for potential items.  Publishers who would like to have a product considered for CEC distribution should write to the Director of Publications and include a distributor discount schedule.

CEC offers a number of options for advertising to members and subscribers. It is estimated that the readership reached by any given issue of a journal is approximately 200,000. Because the journals are found in most libraries and many teacher rooms and re
source centers it is read by many more than our 53,000 members. Advertising placed in Exceptional Children and TEACHING Exceptional Children provides publishers and manufacturers excellent opportunities to reach professionals and parents.<P>

<center> <b><a name="1">Foreword</b></center> <p>

The Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), as the largest professional
organization representing those individuals dedicated to improving the
educational outcomes for children and youth with disabilities and those
who are gifted, is pleased to provide you with a collection of
professional policies.  These policies outline CEC's basic commitments and
responsibilities to exceptional children and are arranged by topical area.
<p>

This publication includes CEC professional policies grouped by the following general topics: <p>
<ul>
<li>	Delivering an Appropriate Education
<li>	Coordinating Responsibilities with Government and Community Representatives
<li>    Responsibilities of the School Administration
<li>	School Attendance
<li>	Creating an Environment of Support and Accountability
<li>	Early Childhood
<li>	Education of the Gifted and Talented
<li>	Managing Communicable Diseases and Students with Special Health Care Needs
<li>	Community-Based Services
<li>	Testing
<li>	Ethnic and Multicultural Groups
<li>	Career Education and Transition
</ul><p>

CEC's professional policies depict what we, as an organization, believe
and value. Such policies are not static, but rather are fluid and
flexible, reflecting the ever-changing aspects of the field.  Our
established, revised, and new policies set the stage for emerging
professional practice and procedures, providing a guideline for prof
essionals, parents, and other advocates who strive to provide quality
education for exceptional learners.  Note that CEC policies that
originally used the term handicap have been changed to read disabilities.
<p>

The policies included in this publication are current as of the Delegate
Assembly held at the 1994 CEC Annual Convention in Denver, Colorado. 
Please be advised that professional policies may be revised, added, or
deleted in future convention meetings of the Delegate Assembly.  Requests

<center> <b> <a name="2">Overview</b></center> <p>

<b>Purpose</b><p>

The Council for Exceptional Children is an association of professional and
other persons whose principal purpose is to obtain optimal educational
opportunity for all children and youth with exceptionalities.  These
children's needs differ sufficiently fro m other children's so that they
require special educational and related services in addition to those
presently available through regular education programs and other human
service delivery systems.  While the legal criteria that define children
and youth with exceptionalities vary greatly from one governmental
jurisdiction to another, The Council for Exceptional Children is primarily
concerned about children and youth having sensory deficits, physical
disabilities, mental retardation, behavioral disorder s, communication
disorders, special learning disabilities, multiple disabilities, gifts and
talents, and children who are developmentally delayed or abused and
neglected.  Children and youth with exceptionalities are found in all
communities regardless of socioeconomic or cultural factors. (Chapter 01,
Para. 1) <p>

<b>Governmental Relations</b><p>

Public policy legislation, litigation, appropriation, regulation, and
negotiated agreements are the means by which children and youth with
exceptionalities have been guaranteed the educational opportunities of our
society.  The Council is deeply committed to the effective implementation
of existing public policy in the interest of children and youth with
exceptionalities.  In addition, The Council seeks extension and creation
of public policy in a manner which will encourage and augment quality
service pr ograms at all governmental levels.  To provide the scope and
kind of services needed, The Council endorses public policies that
strengthen and enhance instructional programs for all children and youth. 
While such general provisions should benefit the exc eptional child, The
Council believes that specific policy provisions are necessary to offer
those children and youth with exceptional needs the opportunity to develop
to their fullest potential.  In carrying out its governmental activities,
The Council wi ll be guided by the policies adopted by its members and by
the directives<p>

<b>Advocacy by Members</b><p>

The Council believes that all persons concerned about the education of
children and youth with exceptionalities must initiate and maintain
efforts to ensure that appropriate public policy is adopted, fully
implemented, and enforced. <p> The Council recognizes that the provision
of public services to children and youth with exceptionalities is a
function of the governmental process.  For this reason, The Council urges
and supports the active involvement of its members in activities that w
ill build greater awareness on the part of parents, communities, and
governmental officials regarding the needs of children and youth with
exceptionalities and will extend appropriate information to such bodies in
their efforts to carry out the objectives of this policy statement. <p>
The Council believes that it is the responsibility of all persons
concerned about the needs of children and youth with exceptionalities to
continually seek to improve government provisions for their education.  In
this regard, The Council pledges its assi stance in providing needed
information and in helping to develop the necessary strategies to attain
improvement of educational services for children and youth with
exceptionalities. <p> In our democratic societies, we have created systems
of law to protect the individual from the abuses of society, particularly
from abuses of the agencies established by society to serve its needs.  In
the attempt to provide what appear to be needed servi ces, the rights of
the individual may be overlooked.  For this reason, The Council urges
constant vigilance on the part of all persons engaged in the education of
children and youth with exceptionalities to assure that the rights of
these individuals and their families are understood and observed.  The
Council further suggests that all public programs and private programs
utilizing public funds be open to review and that flexibility be provided
to allow for judicial consideration of such matter. (Chapter 01, Para. 3)

<b>Accessibility</b><p>

The Council for Exceptional Children provides a physical and emotional
environment that is sensitive to the needs, feelings, and opinions of
persons with varying mobility and communication needs.  CEC makes special
efforts to encourage the participation o f members with exceptionalities
in its activities and the utilization of its services.  The Council for
Exceptional Children: <ol type=a> <li> Identifies CEC members and other
professionals with exceptionalities who would make use of communication,
accessibility, and mobility resources. <li> Facilitates communication
between professionals with exceptionalities and CEC headquarters staff.
<li> Orients CEC members and headquarters staff to the needs of
professionals with exceptionalities. <li> Informs professionals with
exceptionalities about the resources available through CEC to enable their
equitable participation in all CEC activities. <li> Guarantees that all
CEC-sponsored activities are conducted in accessible and usable facilities
and communication modes to ensure full and equitable participation of
professionals with exceptionalitites. (Chapter 01, Para. 4)</ol><p>

<center> <b><a name="3">Delivering an Appropriate Education</center><p>  

Education Is the Right of All Children</b><p>

The principle of education for all is based on democracy's philosophical
premise that every person is valuable in his or her own right and should
be afforded equal opportunities to develop his or her full potential. 
Thus, no democratic society should den y educational opportunities to any
child, regardless of the child's potential for making a contribution to
society.  Since the passage of the first public school laws in the
mid-19th century, this principle has received general endorsement and
qualified execution.  While lip service has been paid to the intent of the
principle, various interpretations of the terms "education" and "all
children" have deprived many children of their rights. <p> The ordinary
educational opportunities provided by the schools have tended to neglect
or exclude children with unusual learning needs: the gifted and talented;
those having sensory deficits, physical disabilities, mental retardation,
behavioral disorders, communication disorders, specific learning
disabilities, or multiple disabilities; and children who are
developmentally delayed or abused and neglected.  These children need
special education and, in order to be able to benefit fully from this
education, they need the opportunity to view themselves as acceptable to
society.  They need stable and supportive home lives, wholesome community
interactions, and the opportunity to view themselves and others in a
healthy manner. <p> Because of their exceptionality, many children need to
begin their school experiences at an earlier age than is customary; many
need formal educational services well into adulthood; and many require
health and social services that are closely coordinated with school
programs.  Meeting these needs is essential to the total development of
children with exceptionalities as individuals and as members of society.
<p>

For some decades now, educators and schools have been responding to the
challenges of educating children with exceptionalities.  Still, not all
children are being provided for fully; the intellectually gifted child,
for example, and many other children who need highly specialized services
are not receiving them.  The community should extend its demand that
school personnel learn to understand and serve the individual needs of
these children as well as those more easily accommodated in the
educational system.  The surge of interest among educators in
individualizing instruction hopefully will mean more sensitivity to the
educational needs of all children, and particularly those with special
needs. <p> Programs for children and youth with exceptionalities should be
varied in nature and conducted in a variety of settings, depending on the
individual needs of the child, the child's family, and the community.  It
is The Council's belief that society should have the legal responsibility
to extend the opportunity for every individual to be educated to the full
extent of his or her capacities, whatever they may be or however they may
be attenuated by special circumstances.  There is no dividing line that
excludes some children and includes others in educational programs. 
Clearly, every exceptional child has the right to a free appropriate
public education that may not in any instance be compromised because of
inadequacies in the educational system or existing public policies.
(Chapter 02, Para. 1) <p>

<b>The Relationship Between Special</b><p>

Special education is an integral part of the total educational enterprise,
not a separate order.  In any school system, special education is a means
of enlarging the capacity of the system to serve the educational needs of
all children. <p>

The particular function of special education within the schools (and the
education departments of other institutions) is to identify children with
unusual needs and to aid in the effective fulfillment of those needs. 
Both regular and special school programs play a role in meeting the
educational needs of children with exceptionalities.  A primary goal of
educators should be to help build accommodative learning opportunities for
children with exceptionalities in regular educational programs.  In the
simple mentation of this goal, special education can serve as a support
system, and special educators can assist regular school personnel in
managing the education of children with exceptionalities. <p> When the
special placement of a child is required, the aim of the placement should
be to maximize the development and freedom of the child rather than to
accommodate the regular classroom. <p> Special education should function
within and as a part of the regular, public school framework.  Within this
framework, the function of special education should be to participate in
the creation and maintenance of a total educational environment suitable

for all children. <p> From their base in the regular school system,
special educators can foster the development of specialized resources by
coordinating their specialized contributions with the contributions of the
regular school system.  One of the primary goals of special e ducators
should be the enhancement of regular school programs as a resource for all
children. (Chapter 03 Para. 1) <p>


<b>Administrative Organization</b><p>

The system of organization and administration developed for special
education should be linked with regular education (a) to increase the
capability of the total system to make more flexible responses to changes
in the behavior of individual pupils and to changing conditions in schools
and society, and (b) to permit all elements of the system to influence the
policies and programs of the others. <p> Special education must provide an
administrative organization to facilitate achievement for children with
exceptionalities of the same educational goals as those pursued by other
children.  This purpose can be achieved through structures that are
sufficiently compatible with those employed by regular education to ensure
easy, unbroken passage of children across regular-special education
administrative lines for whatever periods of time may be necessary, as
well as by structures that are sufficiently flexible to adjust quickly to
changing task demands and child growth needs. <p> The major purpose of the
special education administrative organization is to provide and maintain
those environmental conditions in schools that are most conducive to the
growth and learning of children with special needs. Under suitable
conditions, education within the regular school environment can provide
the optimal opportunity for most children with exceptionalities. 
Consequently, the system for the delivery of special education must enable
the incorporation of specia

l help and opportunities in regular educational settings.  Children should spend only as much time outside regular class settings as is necessary to control learning variables that are critical to the achievement of specified learning   goals. (Chapter   







03, Para. 2) <p>

<b>Scope of Program</b><p>

Education for children and youth with exceptionalities requires the well-planned and purposeful coordination of many disciplines.  Special education is a cross-disciplinary, problem-oriented field of services which is directed toward mobilizing and improv







ing a variety of resources to meet the educational needs of children and youth with   exceptonalities. (Chapter   03, Para. 3) <p>

<b>The Goal and Commitment of Special Education</b><p>

The fundamental purposes of special education are the same as those of regular education: the optimal development of the student as a skillful, free, and purposeful person, able to plan and manage his or her own life and to reach his or her highest potent







ial as an individual and as a member of society.  Indeed, special education developed as a highly specialized area of education in order to provide children with exceptionalities with the same opportunities as other children for a meaningful, purposeful, 







and fulfilling life. <p>
Perhaps the most important concept that has been developed in special education as the result of experiences with children with exceptionalities is that of the fundamental individualism of every child.  The aspiration of special educators is to see eve ch







ild as a unique composite of potentials, abilities, and learning needs for whom an educational program must be designed to meet his or her particular needs.  From its beginnings, special education had championed the cause of children with learning problem







s.  It is as the advocates of such children and of the concept of individualization that special education can come to play a major creative role in the mainstream of education. <p>
The special competencies of special educators are more than a collection of techniques and skills.  They comprise a body of knowledge, methods, and philosophical tenets that are the hallmark of the profession.  As professionals, special educators are dedi







cated to the optimal education of children with exceptionalities and they reject the misconception of schooling that is nothing but custodial care. <p>
The focus of all education should be the unique learning needs of the individual child as a total functioning organism.  All educators should recognize and accept that special and regular education share the same fundamental goals. <p>
Special education expands the capacity of schools to respond to the educational needs of all students. <p>
As advocates of the right of all children to an appropriate education, special educators affirm their professionalism. (Chapter 03, Para. 4) <p>

<b>Educational Environments for Exceptional Students</b><p>

Special education takes many forms and can be provided with a broad spectrum of administrative arrangements.  Children with special educational needs should be served in regular classes and neighborhood schools insofar as these arrangements are conducive 







to good educational progress.  The Council believes that the goal of educating exceptional children with non-exceptional children is desirable if the individual program is such that it will enhance the exceptional child's educational, social, emotional, a







nd vocational development. <p>
It is sometimes necessary, however, to provide special supplementary services for children with exceptionalities or to remove them from parts or all of the regular educational program.  It may even be necessary to remove some children from their homes and







 communities in order for them to receive education and related services in residential schools, hospitals, or training centers.  The Council believes that careful study and compelling reasons are necessary to justify such removal. <p>
The Council charges each public agency to ensure that a continuum of alternative placements, ranging from regular class programs to residential settings, is available to meet the needs of children with exceptionalities.<p>
Children with exceptionalities enrolled in special school programs should be given every appropriate opportunity to participate in educational, nonacademic, and extracurricular programs and services with children who are not disabled or whose disabilities







 are less severe. <p>
While special schools for children with exceptionalities and other separate educational facilities may function as part of an effective special educational delivery system, it is indefensible to confine groups of exceptional pupils inappropriately in such







 settings as a result of the failure to develop a full continuum of less restrictive programs.  The Council condemns as educationally and morally indefensible the practice of categorical isolation by exceptionality without full consideration of the unique







 needs of each student, and the rejection of children who are difficult to teach from regular school situations.  When insufficient program options exist and when decisions are poorly made, children with exceptionalities are denied their fundamental right







s to free public education.  In so acting, education authorities violate the basic tenets of our democratic societies. <p>

Like all children, children with exceptionalities need environmental stability, emotional nurturance, and social acceptance.  Decisions about the delivery of special education to children with exceptionalities should be made after careful consideration of







 their home, school, and community relationships, their personal preferences, and effects on self-concept, in addition to other sound educational considerations. (Chapter 03, Para. 5) <p>

<b>Inclusive Schools and Community Settings</b><p>
The Council for Exceptional Children believes all children, youth, and young adults with disabilities are entitled to a free and appropriate education and/or services that lead to an adult life characterized by satisfying relations with others, independen







t living, productive engagement in the community, and participation in society at large.  To achieve such outcomes, there must exist for all children, youth, and young adults a rich variety of early intervention, educational, and vocational program option







s and experiences.  Access to these programs and experiences should be based on individual educational needs and desired outcomes.  Furthermore, students and their families or guardians, as members of the planning team, may recommend the placement, curric







ulum option, and the exit document to be pursued. <p>
CEC believes that a continuum of services must be available for all children, youth, and young adults.  CEC also believes that the concept of inclusion is a meaningful goal to be pursued in our schools and communities.  In addition, CEC believes children,







 youth, and young adults with disabilities should be served whenever possible in general education classrooms in inclusive neighborhood schools and community settings.  Such settings should be strengthened and supported by an infusion of specially trained







 personnel and other appropriate supportive practices according to the individual needs of the child. <p>

<b>Policy Implications</b><p>

Schools.  In inclusive schools, the building administrator and staff with assistance from the special education administration should be primarily responsible for the education of children, youth, and young adults with disabilities.  The administrator(s) 







and other school personnel must have available to them appropriate support and technical assistance to enable them to fulfill their responsibilities.  Leaders in state/provincial and local governments must redefine rules and regulations as necessary, and 







grant school personnel greater authority to make decisions regarding curriculum, materials, instructional practice, and staffing patterns.  In return for greater autonomy, the school administrator and staff should establish high standards for each child, 







youth, and young adult, and should be held accountable for his or her progress toward outcomes. <p>


Communities.  Inclusive schools must be located in inclusive communities; therefore, CEC invites all educators, other professionals, and family members to work together to create early intervention, educational, and vocational programs and experiences tha







t are collegial, inclusive, and responsive to the diversity of children, youth, and young adults.  Policy makers at the highest levels of state/ provincial and local government, as well as school administration, also must support inclusion in the educatio







nal reforms they espouse.  Further, the policy makers should fund programs in nutrition, early intervention, health care, parent education, and other social support programs that prepare all children, youth, and young adults to do well in school.  There c







an be no meaningful school reform, nor inclusive schools, without funding of these key prerequisites.  As important, there must be interagency agreements and collaboration with local governments and business to help prepare students to assume a constructi







ve role in an inclusive community.<p>


Professional Development.  Finally, state/provincial departments of education, local educational districts, and colleges and universities must provide high-quality preservice and continuing professional development experiences that prepare all general edu







cators to work effectively with children, youth, and young adults representing a wide range of abilities and disabilities, experiences, cultural and linguistic backgrounds, attitudes, and expectations.  Moreover, special educators should be trained with a







n emphasis on their roles in inclusive schools and community settings.  They also must learn the importance of establishing ambitious goals for their students and of using appropriate means of monitoring the progress of children, youth, and young adults. 







(Chapter 03, Para. 6)<p>


<b>Individualized Education Programs</b><p>

The creation and operation of a series of alternative settings for exceptional persons to live their lives and to develop to the greatest degree possible requires that service providers continuously strive to deliver the highest quality services possible.







  The Council believes that the central element for the delivery of all the services required by a person with an exceptionality must be an individually designed program.  Such a program must contain the objectives to be attained, resources to be allocate







d, evaluation procedures and time schedule to be employed, and a termination date for ending the program and procedure for developing a new one.  The process for developing an individualized program must adhere to all the procedural safeguards of due proc







ess of law and must involve the individual person and his or her family, surrogate, advocate, or legal representative. (Chapter 03, Para. 8)<p>


<b>Labeling and Categorizing of Children</b><p>

The field of special education is concerned with children who have unique needs and with school programs that employ specialized techniques.  As the result of early attitudes and programs that stressed assistance for children with severe disabilities, the







 field developed a vocabulary and practices based on the labeling and categorizing of children.  In recent decades, labeling and categorizing were extended to children with milder degrees of exceptionality.  Unfortunately, the continued use of labels tend







s to rigidify the thinking of all educators concerning the significance and purpose of special education and thus to be dysfunctional and even harmful for children.<p>
Words such as "defective," "disabled," "retarded," "impaired," "disturbed," and "disordered," when attached to children with special needs, are stigmatic labels that produce unfortunate results in both the children and in the community's attitudes toward 







the children.  These problems are magnified when the field organizes and regulates its programs on the basis of classification systems that define categories of children according to such terms.  Many of these classifications are oriented to etiology, pro







gnosis, or necessary medical treatment rather than to educational classifications.  They are thus of little value to the schools.  Simple psychometric thresholds, which have sometimes been allowed to become pivotal considerations in educational decision m







aking, present another set of labeling problems.<p>
Special education's most valuable contribution to education is its specialized knowledge, competencies, values, and procedures for individualizing educational programs for individual children, whatever their special needs.  Indeed, special educators at th







eir most creative are the advocates of children who are not well served by schools except through special arrangements.  To further the understanding of and programming for such children, special educators as well as other educational personnel should eli







minate the use of simplistic categorizing.<p>
No one can deny the importance of some of the variables of traditional significance in special education such as intelligence, hearing, and vision.  However, these variables in all their complex forms and degrees must be assessed in terms of educational r







elevance for a particular child.  Turning them into typologies that may contribute to excesses in labeling and categorizing children is indefensible and should be eliminated.<p>
In the past, many legislative and regulatory systems have specified criteria for including children in an approved category as the starting point for specialized programming and funding.  This practice places high incentives on the labeling of children an







d undoubtedly results in the erroneous placement of many children.
It is desirable that financial aids be tied to educational programs rather than to children and that systems for allocating children to specialized programs be much more open than in the past.
Special educators should enhance the accommodative capacity of schools and other educational agencies to serve children with special needs more effectively.  In identifying such children, special educators should be concerned with the identification of th







eir educational needs, not with generalized labeling or categorizing of children.<p>
Decisions about the education of children should be made in terms of carefully individualized procedures that are explicitly oriented to children's developmental needs.<p>
To further discourage the labeling and categorizing of children, programs should be created on the basis of educational functions served rather than on the basis of categories of children served.
Regulatory systems that enforce the rigid categorization of pupils as a way of allocating them to specialized programs are indefensible.  Financial aid for special education should be tied to specialized programs rather than to finding and placing childre







n in those categories and programs. (Chapter 03, Para. 12)<p>

<center> <b><a name="4">Coordinating Responsibilities with Government<br> and <br>Community Representatives</b></center> <p>



<b>Government Responsibilities for <br>Special Education in Intermediate <br>and Local School Districts</b><p>

Intermediate and local school districts carry major responsibility for the quality of educational services to children and youth with exceptionalities and for leadership and coordination with other agencies to achieve comprehensive child centered services







.  Intermediate and local school districts should provide continuing leadership for all educational services in the community, including participation in the financing of every education program in the district and of any program outside the district whic







h serves children and youth with exceptionalities at the district's request.<p>
The Council believes that school districts should be responsible for an annual review of children and youth with exceptionalities who are legal residents of the district to assure that their education is proceeding adequately, even though they may be rece







iving their educational services outside their district of residence. (Chapter 02, Para. 2)<p>

<b>State or Provincial Governments</b><p>

The basic responsibility for guaranteeing an education to all children rests with state or provincial governments through their state or provincial education agencies; however, the fulfillment of this responsibility is effected in cooperation with federal







 and local education authorities.  The Council believes that it is the responsibility of the state/ province to guarantee each child comprehensive educational opportunities without cost to the child or the child's family.  Special financial support should







 be offered to the intermediate and local districts or combinations of these units so that no excess local cost is involved in providing specialized quality programs, services, and facilities.  While the cost of services for children and youth with except







ionalities varies greatly, such considerations should not affect the goal of optimal programming for every child.  The Council believes that no financial incentive should be provided to encourage the adoption of a less than optimal education program.  A p







articular responsibility of state/ province governments is to provide progressive leadership and direction to coordinated state/provincial programs of special education and to provide coordination among the several departments of government other than edu







cation which may be called upon to serve children and youth with exceptionalities and their families. (Chapter 02, Para. 3)<p>


<b>Federal Governments of the<br> United States and Canada</b><p>

The Council believes the federal government should give major attention to guaranteeing educational opportunities to children and youth whose education has been neglected.  The federal government has a responsibility for assuring that the rights of childr







en with exceptionalities are not violated.  Because education of children and youth with exceptionalities has, in general, been a neglected area, special categories of support should be directed to meeting their needs.  Federal financial aid should be dir







ected to state or provincial governments for the education of children with exceptionalities.<p>


The federal government should provide for support of professional leadership in the field of special education with emphasis on assessment of needs, planning of needed programs, preparation of personnel, and research.<p>
The federal government should provide financial support to colleges, universities, and other appropriate agencies to assist in operating programs to prepare all needed personnel to conduct comprehensive special education programs and services.<p>
The federal government should provide financial support to school districts and combinations of school districts that wish to provide innovative or exemplary programs for children and youth with exceptionalities or that, for any reason, enroll an unusuall







y high proportion of children and youth with special needs.<p>
The federal government should provide major support to programs in the field of special education that serve regional or national needs such as the education of migrant children.<p>
In instances where the federal government assumes primary responsibility for the education of a group of children (i.e., American Indian and Alaska Native children in Bureau of Indian Affairs operated and contracted schools and the education of dependents







 in Department of Defense schools and programs), it must also provide appropriate special education to these groups.  As one means of accomplishing this goal, the Department of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, should maintain a specific budget line ite







m for special education and related services for children with exceptionalities. (Chapter 02, Para. 4)<p>



<b>Intergovernmental Planning</b><p>

The success of the functions of federal, state/provincial, and local government requires close cooperative planning of a short- and long-term nature.  Such planning requires excellence in communicative skills and facilities.  Such plans for the education 







of children and youth with exceptionalities should form the basis for new and improved legislative and government policies at all levels of government. (Chapter 02, Para. 5)<p>


<b>Liaison with Other Agencies <br>and Organizations</b><p>

Children and youth with exceptionalities and their families require the services of many agencies that deal with their various needs.  In most cases, individual agency efforts can be made more effective through a cooperative interagency and interdisciplin







ary approach whereby special education has a primary function for liaison with other agencies and organizations.  This approach will not only encourage a consistent effort on the part of all concerned with the child's education and development, but will p







rovide for joint establishment of the priorities and respective responsibilities for meeting the child's needs.  Public policy should be encouraged at the state, provincial, and federal levels for a coordinated approach to multifunded projects under one a







pplication procedure to ensure comprehensive services to the child.  Such policies should support and facilitate intergovernmental cooperation as well as interagency linkage.  The Council encourages policies that promote a coordinated approach to planning







 for the needs of children and youth with exceptionalities and that strengthen the relationships of special education to public and private agencies providing services.  The Council at all levels should consistently support a coordinated effort. (Chapter 







05, Para. 1)<p>


<b>Public Participation</b><p>

Administrative units at all levels of government responsible for providing leadership must have responsibility for developing policy regarding the education of children and youth with exceptionalities.  However, such policy must reflect the thinking of al







l persons involved in the education of children and youth with exceptionalities.  The Council believes that advisory committees can help government agencies assess problems, plan and set priorities, and develop and oversee policies regarding the education







 of children and youth with exceptionalities.  The Council further believes that all policies involving education of children and youth with exceptionalities should be brought before recurring public and legislative scrutiny. (Chapter 05, Para. 2)<p>


<b>The School and the Family</b><p>

Parents must have access to all available necessary information in order to be able to make optimal decisions about the child's education and to fulfill the family's obligations to the child.<p>
As a means of strengthening special education programs, the parents of children with exceptionalities and organized community groups should be given a responsible voice in educational policy formation and planning activities.<p>
The primary consumers of educational services, the children, should not be ignored as a valuable resource in the evaluation of the organization and delivery of services.<p>
As a means of strengthening the family in fulfilling its obligations to children with exceptional needs, the schools should provide educationally-related counseling and family services.  In cases of clear educational neglect, the schools, through qualifie







d professional personnel, should make extraordinary arrangements for educational services.<p>
Access includes making information available at convenient times and locations and providing information in the parent's native language or mode of communication whenever necessary. (Chapter 05, Para. 3)<p>


<b>Private Sector</b><p>

The private sector (nonprofit) has long played a significant role in the field of special education.  The elements of the private sector (nonprofit) are varied and encompass the full gamut of levels of educational programs and services from preschool educ







ation through higher education, research, demonstration projects, personnel training, technology, and the development and production of media and materials.  Increasingly, a working relationship has developed between the public and private sectors (nonpro







fit) regarding children and youth with exceptionalities.<p>
The Council believes that private enterprise (nonprofit) can make major contributions to the development of adequate special education services. The Council urges cooperation between government and private enterprise (nonprofit) to meet the needs of child







ren and youth with exceptionalities.  The Council urges that legislation be flexible enough to allow administrative agencies to involve the private sector (nonprofit) in all aspects of program development.<p>
The Council believes that the opportunity for all children to receive an education is a public responsibility, but that program operation of such services may be conducted in varied settings and through a variety of public and private (nonprofit) agencies







.  For this reason, The Council supports the development and provision of special services in both the public and private sectors (nonprofit) and the support for such services through public funds, under public control and supervision.<p>
The Council believes that when children with exceptionalities receive their education in the private sector (nonprofit) as a matter of public policy, then the appropriate state public agency shall approve the education program and personnel in such facili







ties, certify that the program is appropriate to the child's educational needs and is provided at no expense to the child or his family, certify that the facility meets appropriate health and safety standards, and guarantee that all rights of children wit







h exceptionalities and their families are maintained. (Chapter 05, Para. 4)<p>

<center> <b><a name="5">Responsibilities of the <br>School Administration</b></center><p>


<b>Responsibility Defined</b><p>

Responsibility for administering special education programs should be clearly defined so that accountability for service effectiveness can be maintained.<p>
In the administration of the special education system, it must be clarified (a) who is to be responsible for various functions and decisions and (b) what procedures can be developed to provide adequate protection of the individual child's rights.  When se







rvices that are essential to the improvement of a child's condition are rendered under several administrative auspices, as is so often the case with children and youth with exceptionalities, which agent or agency is to be responsible for providing which a







spects of treatment needs to be clearly defined at every level to produce the most effective outcomes for the child.<p>
The major functions commonly assigned to administrators of special education programs include the following:<p>
<ol type=a>

<li>	Establishing and maintaining effective ways of identifying children with special education needs.
<li>	Assessing the special needs of children to determine what kinds of special programs and services should be provided for them.
<li>	Planning and organizing an appropriate variety of interventions or program alternatives for children with exceptionalities.
<li>	Marshalling the resources needed to conduct a comprehensive program of special education.
<li>	Using direction, coordination, and consultation as required to guide the efforts of all those who are engaged in the special education enterprise.
<li>	Conducting evaluation and research activities to reflect new emphases and to incorporate new knowledge and constantly improve special instruction and the quality of special services.
<li>	Involving community representatives in planning programs to ensure their understanding and support.
<li>	Conducting programs for staff development, such as inservice or continuing education. (Chapter 04, Para. 1)

</ol><p>
<b>Leadership</b><p>

The Council urges state/provincial and local education agencies to develop administrative structures on a policy-making level and to staff such programs with professionally qualified personnel who can provide dynamic leadership.  Creative leadership at al







l levels of government is imperative for the development and improvement of programs for children and youth with exceptionalities.  For this reason, The Council supports efforts to improve the quality of leadership and administrative operations in all pha







ses of educational endeavor. (Chapter 04, Para. 2)<p>


<b>Administrative Hierarchy</b><p>

Every school system should contain a visible central administrative unit for special education programs and services that is at the same administrative hierarchical level as other major instructional program units.<p>
The parameters of regular and special education should be articulated so that children may be afforded equal educational opportunity through the resources of either or both instructional programs.<p>
Such articulation should be achieved through sensitive negotiations between the responsible agents of both regular and special education who meet in full parity.  To protect the rights of all children to equal educational opportunity, the policymaking bod







ies of school systems should include administrators of both regular and special education.<p>
Programs to meet the needs of children with exceptionalities are no less important than those designed to meet the needs of other children.  The importance of programs to meet human needs should not be judged on the basis of the number of clients the prog







rams are expected to serve. (Chapter 04, Para. 3)<p>


<b>Special Education and School Budgets</b><p>

Success of all education programs is dependent on the provision of adequate funding.  This is essentially true of programs for children and youth with exceptionalities.  Often funding for such programs becomes buried in general budgeting procedures.  In s







uch cases, children and youth with exceptionalities do not have the opportunity to have their needs directly considered by the decision-making bodies of government.  Therefore, The Council urges that efforts be undertaken to assure that budgetary provisio







ns for children and youth with exceptionalities be clearly identified.  The Council opposes general funding procedures that would circumvent direct aid to programs for children and youth with exceptionalities.<p>
Since children with exceptionalities have the same rights to education as other children, the educational needs of children with exceptionalities cannot be delayed until the needs and service demands of the majority of children have been satisfied.  Educa







tional resources are always likely to be finite.  The application of the principle of "the greatest good for the greatest number" to determine which children's needs shall be met first directly contradicts our democratic society's declared commitment to e







qual educational opportunity for all children.  History confirms that the social injustices and ill effects that flow from the application of the majority-first principle to educational budgeting are too serious for this principle to be used in educationa







l financing.<p>
Children with exceptionalities constitute a minority of the school population.  The programs serving them represent a comparatively high financial investment in relation to the numbers of children served.  In some school systems, money allocated to specia







l education is regarded as an alternative to the improvement of regular school programs.  The climate of competitive interests thus produced can jeopardize the stability of special education services.<p>
The interests of the community are ill served if competition for funds is conducted on the basis of special interests.  What is needed, rather, is the cooperation of both regular and special educators to educate the public in the desirability of meeting t







he needs of all children without discrimination or favoritism.<p>
There is every reason to believe that the public interest is best protected when the responsibility for the deployment of public resources is placed in the hands of persons who are qualified by training and experience to make the necessary judgments.  Thu







s, special education should play an active role in determining how resources are to be allocated.  However, the community has the ultimate responsibility to determine goals and to evaluate performance.<p>
Resources should be allocated to special education on the basis of programs to be provided, not on the basis of traditional categorical incidence estimates.<p>
The mandate to provide all children with equal educational opportunities requires that all educators, whether regular or special, be equally concerned with the funding of both regular and special education programs.  No school system can fulfill the manda







te if rivalries for dollars are permitted to supersede the needs of children. (Chapter 04, Para. 4)<p>

<center> <b><a name="6">School Attendance</b></center><p>


<b>Compulsory Services <br>and Attendance</b><p>

The provision for universal education of children in a democratic society has been translated as a commitment to providing educational opportunities for every child, whatever may be his or her socioeconomic status; cultural or racial origins; physical, in







tellectual, or emotional status; potential contribution to society; and educational needs.  This commitment to every child thus includes a commitment to children with unusual learning needs and to those with outstanding abilities and talents.  Although pr







oviding education for these children may require a variety of specialized services and instructional programs, some costly and some requiring radical innovations in traditional educational structures, there is no basis for including some children and excl







uding others where the principle of universal education is concerned.<p>

Some of the specialized services that may be essential if children with exceptionalities are to attend school include the provision of specialized transportation, functional architectural environments, personalized equipment and aids, individualized instr







uctional programs, and special education and support personnel.  Certainly the fiscal requirements for such programs may be great; if they are not instituted and maintained, however, the cost of neglect is infinitely greater and must be borne mainly by th







e children as well as by their families, communities, and society as a whole.<p>
The commitment to education for all encompasses the responsibility for providing special forms of education to children and youth with exceptional characteristics and needs.  This responsibility extends to all types of exceptionalities, regardless of the 







degree to which a child may eventually be able to contribute to society.  To this end, The Council supports efforts to eliminate exclusionary clauses in compulsory school attendance laws and other such laws and administrative practices which deny children







 and youth with exceptionalities the educational opportunity they require. (Chapter 02, Para. 6)<p>


<b>Maintenance of Attendance:<br> School Exemption, Exclusion, Suspension, or Expulsion</b><p>

The school's commitment to compulsory, universal education has often been circumvented by the indiscriminate use of exemption, exclusion, and expulsion.  Children with exceptionalities have frequently been excluded from schools on the unacceptable grounds







 that they were uneducable, had undesirable characteristics, or disrupted the education of other children.<p>
Legal decisions in recent years have emphasized the right of children to attend school unless their presence is provably harmful to others.  Other decisions have enunciated the doctrine that children have a legal right to education and therefore cannot be







 excluded from all or part of school activities without legal procedures.<p>
Although children are normally exempted from school for routine reasons of illness or family arrangements, long-term exemptions should be permitted only under extraordinary conditions and should be under continual review.<p>
Since no child's right to an education may be legally abrogated, the exclusion of any child on the ground that no facilities are available for that child cannot be tolerated.  For several decades, the trend in state and provincial laws has been to develop







 special education services at local levels.  Special programs for a small number of children with exceptionalities that may seem impractical can often be made possible by innovative approaches and uses of available regular and consultative personnel.<p>
<b>Policy:</b>	The exemption, exclusion, suspension, or expulsion of children from all or part of school activities should not be permitted except under extraordinary conditions and with due acknowledgment of their legal rights.  In such cases, appropriat







e levels of alternative instruction should be available.<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>	All exclusions should be for stated periods of time and should include definite provisions for admitting or readmitting the child to school.
<li>	A child so excluded should remain the continuing responsibility of the schools.  During the period in which the student is not in school, plans to modify the child's behavior and meet with parents and others to review the appropriateness of the progr







am are encouraged so that the child can be readmitted as soon as possible.
<li>	Outside agencies should be involved when necessary to facilitate readmission.
<li>	An accurate register should be maintained by local school agencies and by state or provincial agencies of all children exempted, excluded, suspended, or expelled from all of parts of school programs and the reasons for the excluding action.
<li>	To prevent the exclusion of children with exceptionalities from local schools, state and provincial agencies should assess the gaps and needs in community services and cooperate with local schools in filling them.</ol><p>

When behavior triggering disciplinary action is not related to a student's exceptionality or to the provision or lack of provision of special education or related services, an education agency may suspend or expel a student who has a disability using the 







agency's standards and procedures applicable to students who are not disabled. (Chapter 02, Para. 7)<p>

<center> <b><a name="7">Creating an Environment of Support<br> and Accountability</b></center><p>


<b>Due Process Protections<br> (Procedural Safeguards)</b><p>

As a final component of quality control, The Council believes that no decisions can be made on behalf of any individual without strict adherence to due process of law.  Most significant is our position that all individuals are entitled to adequate represe







ntation when such decisions are being made.  We support the increasing efforts on the part of governments to officially require the assignment of a surrogate when a family member is not available for purposes of adequately representing the interests of th







e person with an exceptionality.  Ultimately, however, whenever possible, a member of the individual's family provides the most desirable representation.  It is also our position that the individual consumer must be given every opportunity to make his or 







her own decisions, that this is a right provided to all citizens, and that any abridgment of that individual right can only occur upon the proper exercise of law. (Chapter 03, Para. 9)<p>


<b>Confidentiality</b><p>

The Council for Exceptional Children urges members to adhere to ethical principles and act in compliance with laws and regulations that protect children and their family's right to privacy and that control the use of confidential information regarding chi







ldren. (Chapter 03, Para. 10)<p>


<b>Program Evaluation</b><p>

Programs designed for the purpose of providing educational opportunities for children and youth with exceptionalities must not be viewed as static, for the end product must always be the exceptional child and his or her personal improvement.  For this rea







son, all programs should contain plans to evaluate their effectiveness, and the results of such evaluations should be presented for public review.<p>
The Council believes that all legislation to fund existing programs or create new programs should contain mechanisms for effective evaluation and that governmental advisory bodies should review the findings of evaluations on a regular basis.  External as 







well as internal systems of evaluation should be developed to aid in the evaluation of programs for children and youth with exceptionalities. (Chapter 03, Para. 11)<p>


<b>Surgical and Chemical Interventions to<br> Control the Behavior of Human Beings</b><p>

The Council condemns the inappropriate use of surgical and chemical interventions to control the behavior of human beings.  Although these procedures often simplify care and maintenance, the integrity of the individual must transcend any institution's des







ire for administrative convenience.  The Council recognizes that in certain circumstances such interventions may be appropriate; however, they should never be used without the approval of the individual to be treated, or the individual's parents or guardi







ans, or, in circumstances where the individual is a ward of the state, the approval of an appropriate review body before which the individual or his or her representatives are guaranteed all legal due-process rights. (Chapter 03, Para. 15)<p>


<b>Physical Intervention</b><p>

The Council recognizes the right to the most effective educational strategies to be the basic educational right of each special education child.  Furthermore, The Council believes that the least restrictive positive educational strategies should be used, 







as it relates to physical intervention, to respect the child's dignity and personal privacy.  Additionally, The Council believes that such interventions shall assure the child's physical freedom, social interaction, and individual choice.  The interventio







n must not include procedures that cause pain or trauma.  Intervention techniques must focus not only on eliminating a certain undesirable behavior, but also upon a determination of the purpose of that behavior, and the provision/instruction of a more app







ropriate behavior.  Lastly, behavior intervention plans must be specifically described in the child's written educational plan with agreement from the education staff, the parents and, when appropriate, the child.<p>
The Council recommends that physical intervention be used only if all the following requirements are met:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>	The child's behavior is dangerous to herself/himself or others, or the behavior is extremely detrimental to or interferes with the education or development of the child.
<li>	Various positive reinforcement techniques have been implemented appropriately and the child has repeatedly failed to respond as documented in the child's records.
<li>	It is evident that withholding physical intervention would significantly impede the child's educational progress as explicitly defined in his or her written educational plan.
<li>	The physical intervention plan specifically will describe the intervention to be implemented, the staff to be responsible for the implementation, the process for documentation, the required training of staff and supervision of staff as it relates to 







the intervention, and when the intervention will be replaced.
<li>	The physical intervention plan will become a part of the written educational plan.
<li>	The physical intervention plan shall encompass the following provisions:</ol><p>
<ol>
<li>	A comprehensive analysis of the child's environment including variables contributing to the inappropriate behavior.
<li>	The plan to be developed by a team including professionals and parents/guardians, as designated by state/provisional and federal law.
<li>	The personnel implementing the plan shall receive specific training congruent with the
contents of the plan and receive ongoing supervision from individuals who are trained and skilled in the techniques identified in the plan.
<li>	The health and medical records of the child must be reviewed to ensure that there are no physical conditions present that would contraindicate the use of the physical intervention proposed.
<li>	The impact of the plan on the child's behavior must be consistently evaluated, the results documented, and the plan modified when indicated.

</ol><p>
The Council supports the following prohibitions:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>	Any intervention that is designed to, or likely to, cause physical pain.
<li>	Releasing noxious, toxic or otherwise unpleasant sprays, mists, or substances in proximity to the child's face.
<li>	Any intervention that denies adequate sleep, food, water, shelter, bedding, physical comfort, or access to bathroom facilities.
<li>	Any intervention that is designed to subject, used to subject, or likely to subject the individual to verbal abuse, ridicule, or humiliation, or that can be expected to cause excessive emotional trauma.
<li>	Restrictive interventions that employ a device or material or objects that simultaneously immobilize all four extremities, including the procedure known as prone containment, except that prone containment may be used by trained personnel as a limited







 emergency intervention.
<li>	Locked seclusion, unless under constant surveillance and observation.
<li>	Any intervention that precludes adequate supervision of the child.
<li>	Any intervention that deprives the individual of one or more of his or her senses.</ol><p>

The Council recognizes that emergency physical intervention may be implemented if the child's behavior poses an imminent and significant threat to his or her physical well-being or to the safety of others.  The intervention must be documented and parents/







guardians must be notified of the incident.<p>
However, emergency physical intervention shall not be used as a substitute for systematic behavioral intervention plans that are designed to change, replace, modify, or eliminate a targeted behavior.<p>


Furthermore, The Council expects school districts and other educational agencies to establish policies and comply with state/provincial and federal law and regulations to ensure the protection of the rights of the child, the parent/guardian, the education







 staff, and the school and local educational agency when physical intervention is applied. (Chapter 03, Para. 16)<p>


<b>Corporal Punishment</b><p>

The Council for Exceptional Children supports the prohibition of the use of corporal punishment in special education.  Corporal punishment is here defined as a situation in which all of the following elements are present: an authority accuses a child of v







iolating a rule and seeks from the child an explanation, whereupon a judgment of guilt is made, followed by physical contact and pain inflicted upon the child.  The Council finds no conditions under which corporal punishment so defined would be the treatm







ent of choice in special education. (Chapter 03, Para. 17)<p>


<b>Child Abuse and Neglect</b><p>

The Council recognizes abused and neglected children as children with exceptionalities.  As professionals concerned with the physical, emotional, and mental well-being of children, educators must take an active role in the protection of children from abus







e and neglect.  The Council reminds its members and citizens in general of the availability of assault and battery statutes and calls upon its members to utilize such statutes when applicable in cases of child abuse.  When child abuse occurs, swift action







 must be taken to report the incident and protect the child.  Delays caused by not knowing what to do or failure to take action, contribute to the child's injury.  Educators and related personnel are urged to learn how to recognize and report child abuse 







and neglect and to know the community resources for treating suspected cases. (Chapter 03, Para. 18)<p>


<b>Staff Preparation for Placement</b><p>

Essential to the appropriate placement of the child with an exceptionality is the preparation of the environment for that child through preservice and/ or inservice training of staff and any other necessary accommodations.<p>

Teacher training institutions are challenged to instruct all teacher candidates about current trends in the education of exceptional children.<p>
State and provincial departments of education are charged with the responsibility to promote inservice activities that will update all professional educators and provide ongoing, meaningful staff development programs.<p>
Administrators can have a significant positive influence upon the professional lives of teaching staff and, therefore, upon the educational lives of children.  Administrative personnel of school districts are, therefore, charged with the responsibility to







 promote inservice education and interprofessional exchanges that openly confront contemporary issues in the education of all children. (Chapter 03, Para. 7)<p>



<b>Treatment of Exceptional <br>Persons in Textbooks</b><p>

The Council proposes the following points as guidelines for early childhood, elementary, secondary, and higher education instructional materials so they more accurately and adequately reflect persons with exceptionalities as full and contributing members 







of society.<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>	In print and nonprint educational materials, 10% of the contents should include or represent children or adults with an exceptionality.
<li>	Representation of persons with exceptionalities should be included in materials at all levels (early childhood through adult) and in all areas of study.
<li>	The representation of persons with exceptionalities should be accurate and free from stereotypes.
<li>	Persons with exceptionalities should be shown in the least restrictive environment.  They should be shown participating in activities in a manner that will include them as part of society.
<li>	In describing persons with exceptionalities, the language used should be nondiscriminatory and free from value judgments.
<li>	Persons with exceptionalities and persons without exceptionalities should be shown interacting in ways that are mutually beneficial.
<li>	Materials should provide a variety of appropriate role models of persons with exceptionalities.
<li>	Emphasis should be on uniqueness and worth of all persons, rather than on the differences between persons with and without exceptionalities.
<li>	Tokenism should be avoided in the representation of persons with exceptionalities. (Chapter 03, Para. 21)</ol><p>


<b>Technology</b><p>

The Council for Exceptional Children recognizes that the appropriate application and modification of present and future technologies can improve the education of exceptional persons.  CEC believes in equal access to technology and supports equal education







al opportunities for technology utilization by all individuals.  Present technologies include electronic tools, devices, media, and techniques such as
<ol type=a>
<li>computers and microprocessors;
<li>	radio, television, and videodisc systems;
<li>	information and communication systems;
<li>	robotics; and (e) assistive and prosthetic</ol><p>
equipment and techniques.  The Council believes in exploring and stimulating the utilization of these technologies in school, at home, at work, and in the community.<p>

CEC encourages the development of product standards and consumer education that will lead to the appropriate and efficient matching of technological applications to individual and local conditions.  CEC recognizes the need to communicate market needs and 







market expectations to decision makers in business, industry, and government.<p>
CEC supports the continuous education of professionals who serve exceptional individuals, through 
(a) collection and dissemination of state-of-the-art information, 
(b) professional development, and 
(c) professional preparation of personnel to perform educational and other services for the benefit of exceptional individuals. (Chapter 03, Para. 22)<p>

<center><b><a name="8">Early Childhood</b></center><p>


<b>Responsibility of the Schools for <br>Early Childhood Education</b><p>

Schools have traditionally assumed educational responsibility for children beginning at about age 5 or 6 and ending with late adolescence.  Increasingly, it is apparent that formal educational experiences at earlier ages would pay rich dividends in the fu







ll development of the capabilities of many children with exceptionalities.  Special educators have useful knowledge and many techniques for working with very young children with exceptionalities.  What is needed is the identification of children who could







 benefit from early education and the actual implementation of programs.<p>
Communities should make their schools responsible for conducting search and census operations through which children who may need specialized education at very early ages can be identified.  The voluntary enrollment of such children by their parents is in







adequate because many parents may not be aware of the child's special needs or of available forms of assistance.  Procedures for child study that encourage adaptations to the particular needs of very young children with exceptionalities are an important p







art of early education programs.<p>
Schools should provide educational services for individuals according to their needs and regardless of age.<p>
Schools should actively seek out children who may have specialized educational needs in the first years of their lives.  A particular commitment should be made to initiate homecare training programs for parents of infants with special needs, to establish 







specialized early childhood and kindergarten programs, and to utilize specialized components of regular early education programs to serve children with exceptionalities. (Chapter 02, Para. 8)<p>



<b>Services to Children with Exceptionalities<br> Ages Birth Through Five</b><p>

The provision of services to children with exceptionalities from birth through 5 years of age must 
be made a priority.  It is the premise of The Council that lack of such services currently represents the most serious impediment to the development of children with exceptionalities.  There is mounting evidence of the effectiveness of programs for very y







oung children with exceptionalities and their families.<p>
Services to young children with exceptionalities are presently provided by a variety of systems at national, state, provincial, and local levels.  There is little systematic coordination between agencies, and major service gaps remain unfilled.  A nationa







l initiative is needed to establish plans for systematic coordination among the social, educational, and health agencies currently serving children with exceptionalities from birth through 5 years in order to ensure maximum benefits for these children and







 their families, and to plan for the future provision of additional programs to fill major gaps in service to this population.<p>
Wide variations in service arrangements are necessary to meet the individual needs of children.  The Council strongly supports the principle that services for young children with exceptionalities, whenever appropriate, be provided in a context that includ







es children without exceptionalities.  Effective integrated experiences can further the development of children with exceptionalities and also can form the roots of respect for diversity in all children.  Since the success of integrated programs relies he







avily on the provision of specialized teacher training and supportive resources, the importance of such supports should be reflected in legislative and funding directives.<p>
In expanding services for children with exceptionalities from birth through 5 years, it is essential that the central role of the parent in the young child's development be recognized.  Programs must be designed to incorporate parental participation and t







o provide support for families in their role as the child's primary care provider.  The training of teachers of young children with exceptionalities should be expanded to include skills in working with parents in mutually helpful ways so that parental and







 agency efforts in helping the child are strengthened. (Chapter 02, Para. 9)<p>

<center><b><a name="9">Education of the Gifted <br>and Talented</b></center><p>


<b>Gifted and Talented Children <br>as Exceptional Children</b><p>

Special education for the gifted is not a question of advantage to the individual versus advantage to society.  It is a matter of advantage to both.  Society has an urgent and accelerated need to develop the abilities and talents of those who promise high







 contribution.  To ignore this obligation and this resource is not only shortsighted but does violence to the basic concept of full educational opportunity for all.<p>
Special educators should vigorously support programs for the gifted and talented as consistent with their concept of the need for special assistance for all children with exceptionalities.  Such programs should reflect both the cognitive and noncognitive 







needs of the gifted and talented. (Chapter 07, Para. 1)<p>


<b>Identification</b><p>

Gifted and talented children are those who are capable of high performance as identified by professionally qualified personnel.  These children require different educational programs and/or services beyond those normally provided by the regular school pro







gram in order to realize their full potential in contribution to self and society.<p>
Broad search and an early identification system for the identification of gifted and talented children within all sectors of the population should be the hallmark of an adequate educational system.  Identification procedures should also reflect individual







 means of identifying children with general intellectual ability, specific academic abilities, leadership abilities, and abilities in the fine and performing arts. (Chapter 07, Para. 2)<p>



<b>Delivery of Services</b><p>

No single administrative plan or educational provision is totally appropriate for the gifted and talented.  Certain administrative and instructional arrangements may provide settings in which the gifted and talented are likely to perform more adequately. 







 In the final analysis, however, the task is one of accommodation to the needs of the individual.<p>
New arrangements and new provisions must be utilized, including freedom to pursue interests which might not fit the prescribed curriculum, opportunities for open blocks of time, opportunities for consultation with persons and use of resources external to 







the classroom, and opportunities to bypass those portions of the curriculum that have been previously achieved by the individual.  These kinds of arrangements must present options across all educational settings and procedures within all programs for the 







gifted and talented, whether in the regular classroom or in highly specialized situations.<p>
Special education for the gifted and talented demands individualization within special programs in terms of student needs, as well as differentiation between programs for the gifted and talented and programs for other children and adults.<p>
A program of special education for the gifted and talented should provide continuing and appropriate educational experiences from preschool into adult years. (Chapter 07, Para. 3)<p>



<b>Preparation of School and Leadership Personnel</b><p>

Special preparation is required for those educators who have either specific or general responsibilities for educating the gifted and talented.  Teachers and other professional educators who work with the gifted and talented need special training in both 







program content and process skills.  Such training should be recognized by appropriate certification in the case of teachers and should receive the general support of local, state, provincial, federal, and private interests. (Chapter 07, Para. 4)<p>


<b>Demonstration Programs</b><p>

The preparation of school personnel in the education of the gifted and talented should be carried out in settings which permit opportunities to examine relevant research and to observe innovative administrative provisions and exemplary instruction.  This 







requires extensive library services, ongoing research or access to such research, and most importantly, centers in which teachers may observe and try out new styles of teaching appropriate to the education of the gifted and talented.<p>
Special model or demonstration programs should be established to illustrate to educators and others the kind and range of innovative program efforts that are possible and effective in the education of gifted and talented students. (Chapter 07, Para. 5)<p>










<b>Research and Development</b><p>

Research and development resources should be focused on the needs of the gifted and talented in order to develop new methodologies and curricula and to allow educators and others to evaluate current and proposed methods. (Chapter 07, Para. 6)<p>


<b>Parents and the Public</b><p>

One responsibility of the special educator is to educate the parents of gifted and talented children concerning their children's needs and rights.<p>
The educational needs of the gifted and talented also warrant planned programs of public information, particularly at the local community level.  Special educators should accept these responsibilities as an important part of their professional involvement







. (Chapter 07, Para. 7)<p>


<b>Financial Support</b><p>

Although programs for the gifted and talented can sometimes be initiated at relatively modest cost, it is important that funds for this purpose be earmarked at local, state or provincial, and national levels.<p>
Principal expenditures should be directed toward the employment of leadership personnel, the development of methods and programs, and of particular importance at the local level, the preparation of persons for the support and implementation of such method







s and programs in the schools.<p>
The importance of optimal educational services for the gifted and talented merits the expenditure of funds in appropriate amounts toward this end by all levels of government as well as by other sources. (Chapter 07, Para. 8)<p>

<center><b><a name="10">Managing Communicable Diseases<br> and<br> Students with Special Health Care Needs</b></center><p>


<b>Managing Communicable and <br>Contagious Diseases</b><p>

Controlling the spread of communicable and contagious diseases within the schools has always been a problem faced by educators, the medical profession, and the public.  Effective policies and procedures for managing such diseases in the schools have histo







rically been developed by health agencies and implemented by the schools.  These policies and procedures were primarily designed to manage acute, temporary conditions rather than chronic conditions that require continuous monitoring and remove children fr







om interaction with other children while the condition is contagious or communicable.<p>
Recent public awareness of chronic infectious diseases such as those with hepatitis B-virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and HIV have raised concerns necessitating the reassessment or at least clarification of school policies and procedures.  T







he Council believes that having a chronic infection does not in itself result in a need for special education.  Further, The Council believes that schools and public health agencies should assure that any such infectious and communicable disease policies 







and procedures:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>	Do not exclude the affected child from the receipt of an appropriate education even when circumstances require the temporary removal of the child from contact with other children.
<li>	Provide that determination of a nontemporary alteration of a child's educational placement should be done on an individual basis, utilizing an interdisciplinary/interagency approach including the child's physician, public health personnel, the child'







s parents, and appropriate educational personnel.
<li>	Provide that decisions involving exceptional children's nontemporary alterations of educational placements or services constitute a change in the child's Individualized Education Program and should thus follow the procedures and protections required.








<li>	Recognize that children vary in the degree and manner in which they come into contact with other children and school staff.
<li>	Provide education staff with the necessary information, training, and hygienic resources to provide for a safe environment for students and educational staff.
<li>	Provide students with appropriate education about infectious diseases and hygienic measures to prevent the spread of such diseases.
<li>	Provide, where appropriate, infected children with education about the additional control measures that they can practice to prevent the transmission of the disease agent.
<li>	Enable educational personnel who are medically at high risk to work in environments that minimize such risk.
<li>	Provide educational personnel with adequate protections for such personnel and their families if they are exposed to such diseases through their employment.</ol><p>


The Council believes that special education personnel preparation programs should:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>	Educate students about infectious diseases and appropriate methods for their management.
<li>	Counsel students about how to determine their level of medical risk in relation to certain diseases and the implications of such risk to career choice.</ol><p>

The Council believes that the manner in which policies for managing infectious diseases are developed and disseminated is important to their effective implementation.  Therefore the following must be considered integral to any such process:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>	That they be developed through the collaborative efforts of health and education agencies at both the state, provincial and local levels, reflecting state, provincial and local educational, health, and legal requirements.
<li>	That provision is made for frequent review and revision to reflect the ever-increasing knowledge being produced through research, case reports, and experience.
<li>	That policies developed be based on reliable identified sources of information and scientific principles endorsed by the medical and educational professions.
<li>	That such policies be understandable to students, professionals, and the public.
<li>	That policy development and dissemination be a continual process and disassociated from pressures associated with precipitating events. (Chapter 03, Para. 19)</ol><p>



<b>Students with Special<br> Health Care Needs</b><p>

The Council for Exceptional Children believes that having a medical diagnosis that qualifies a student as one with a special health care need does not in itself result in a need for special education.  Students with specialized health care needs are those







 who require specialized technological health care procedures for life support and/or health support during the school day.  The Council believes the policies and procedures developed by schools and health care agencies that serve students with special he







alth care needs should:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>	Not exclude a student from receipt of appropriate special education and related services.
<li>	Not exclude a student from receipt of appropriate educational services in the least restrictive environment.
<li>	Not require educational agencies to assume financial responsibility for noneducationally related medical services.
<li>	Define clearly the type, nature, and extent of appropriate related services to be provided and the nature of the appropriate provider.
<li>	Assure that placement and service decisions involve interdisciplinary teams of personnel knowledgeable about the student, the meaning of evaluation data, and placement options.
<li>	Promote a safe learning environment, including reasonable standards for a clean environment in which health risks can be minimized for all involved.
<li>	Provide assurance that health care services are delivered by appropriate and adequately trained personnel.
<li>	Provide appropriate medical and legal information about the special health care needs of students for all staff.
<li>	Provide appropriate support mechanisms for students, families, and personnel involved with students with special health care needs.
<li>	Provide appropriate and safe transportation.</ol><p>


The Council for Exceptional Children believes that special education personnel preparation and continuing education programs should provide knowledge and skills related to: (1) the nature and management of students with special health care needs; (2) exem







plary approaches and models for the delivery of services to students with special health care needs; and (3) the importance and necessity for establishing support systems for students, parents/families, and personnel.<p>
Recognizing that this population of students is unique and relatively small, The Council for Exceptional Children still believes that the manner in which policies are developed and disseminated related to students with special health care needs is critica







lly important to effective implementation.  In development of policy and procedure for this low-incidence population, the following must be considered integral to any such process:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>	That it be developed through collaborative efforts of health and education agencies at state, provincial, and local level.
<li>	That it reflects federal, state, provincial, and local educational, health, and legal requirements.
<li>	That it provides for frequent review and revision of intervention techniques and programs as a result of new knowledge identified through research, program evaluation and monitoring, and other review mechanisms.
<li>	That policies are supported by data obtained from medical and educational professions.
<li>	That policy development is easily understandable by students, professionals, and the public at large.
<li>	That policy development and dissemination should be a continual process and disassociated from pressures associated with precipitating events. (Chapter 03, Para. 23)</ol><p>

<center><b> <a name="11">Community-Based Services</b></center><p>

<b>Prerequisites</b><p>

Significant nationwide trends, both to reduce the populations of institutions and to improve the services provided for those who are institutionalized, necessitate comprehensive public policies on community-based services. Numerous exceptional children an







d adults reside in institutions.  The quantity and quality of education and other service programs provided in these facilities vary greatly.  Considerable evidence, however, has been collected demonstrating that many institutions for exceptional citizens







 have failed to meet the needs of their residents.  Institutionalization, in many instances, has violated basic individual rights and fostered inhumane deprivations.  Rights violated include the opportunity to live in a humane environment and be provided 







with individual programs of treatment designed to allow each person to develop to the greatest degree possible. <p>
    Despite public and professional awareness of deplorable institutional conditions, person with exceptionalities who could not live in natural homes were routinely placed in institutions.  Alternative service arrangements were usually not available and 







an implicit assumption was  made that some persons with disabilities were incapable of growth.  The lack of quality services and the stigma of negative attitudes must be changed.  <p>
    The Council, recognizing the necessity for community-based services, maintains that the human services system must adhere to the principle of normalization to avoid destructive individual and societal consequences and adhere to the following prerequis







ites:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Central to a person's growth and dignity is a right to live within the community, with access to high quality and appropriate services.
<li>A legal mandate with fixed responsibility must exist providing community services for all persons, including those now institutionalized.
<li>the goal of community services is to assure the greatest developmental gains on the part of the in individual through maximum flexibility in all services.
<li>The ongoing process of normalizing the service system requires developing a continuum, of community-based living environments and the selective use of the full range of services available to the entire community.  
<li>Multiple and diverse methods of safeguarding program quality are essential at every level of responsibility.
<li>All programs provided to exceptional persons must include written standards governing service delivery.
<li>When a state restricts an individual's fundamental liberty, it must adhere to the principle of least restrictive environment and, further, absolutely guarantee due process. (Chapter 06, Para. 1)</ol><p>

<b>Characteristics</b><p>
A comprehensive community-based service system for exceptional persons should reflect the following characteristics:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Services must meet the needs of persons of all ages, must accommodate the problems of individuals possessing all degrees of disabilities, and be available when needed and where needed by the individual.
<li>Services must be appropriately located in populous neighborhoods and should be compatible with the surrounding community.
<li>Services must be based upon a systematic plan for continuity that interrelates with other established services.
<li>Services must have a legally vested authority that enables the fixing of responsibility and accountability with implementation power.
<li>Services must be designed to permit the placement of exceptional persons in high quality programs in the least restrictive environment.
<li>Services must be economically sound in meeting human development needs.  (Chapter 06, Para. 2)</ol><p>

<b>The Need for Flexibility<br> and Development</b><p>
Because of rapid changes and developments  in the environmental factors that influence the characteristics of children and the conditions of their lives, special education should maintain a flexibility that permits it to adapt to changing requirements.<p>








    Some of the events and changes that have had major impact on special education in recent years are the following: a rubella epidemic, discovery of preventatives for retrolental fibroplasia, increasing  numbers of premature births, increasing awareness







 of the deleterious effects of poverty and malnutrition, new techniques in surgical intervention, invention of individual electronic hearing aids, and adaptation of low-vision aids.  Changes and developments in public health, medicine, technology, and soc







ial programs may have only a small total effect on school systems, but they frequently have major impacts on special education are quickly reflected in other aspects of the field as, for example, the rapid development of day school programs for children w







ith exceptionalities which has been reflected in a more severely disabled population in residential schools.<p>
    Special educators must seek to be highly flexible in the provision of services and the use of technology and techniques to meet the changing needs of children with exceptionalities.
    School administrators and special educators have particular responsibility for sustaining their professional awareness and development as a basis for changing programs to meet changing needs. (Chapter 06, Para. 3)<p>

<b>Prevention of Disabling Conditions</b><p>
Increasing knowledge of the biological and social causes of many disabling conditions now makes some conditions preventable.  The Council believes that appropriate prenatal counseling and care and intervention services could prevent or reduce the severity







 of many disabling conditions.  Therefore, The Council believes that there should be substantial governmental attention and resources devoted to prevention and the amelioration of the impact of disabling conditions including:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Research and development.
<li>Public awareness.
<li>Prenatal services.
<li>Child-and family-centered early intervention services.
<li>Family and parenting education and support programs for teenagers and other high-risk populations.
<li>Reduction of social and environmental factors that cause disabling conditions.  (Chapter 06, Para. 4)</ol><p>

<center><b><a name="12">Testing</b></center><p>
<b>Group Intelligence Testing</b><p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Psychological tests of many kinds saturate our society and their use can result in the irreversible deprivation of opportunity to many children especially those already burdened by poverty and prejudice.
<li>Most group intelligence tests are multileveled and standardized on grade samples, thus necessitating the use of interpolated and extrapolated norms and scores.
<li>Most group intelligence tests, standardized on LEAs rather than on individual students, are not standardized on representitive populations.
<li>In spite of the use of nonrepresentative group standardization's procedures, the norms are expressed in individual scores.
<li>Most group intelligence tests, standardized on districts which volunteer, may have a bias in the standardization.
<li>Many of the more severely disabled and those expelled or suspended have no opportunity to influence the norms.
<li>Group intelligence tests are heavily weighted with language and will often yield spurious estimates of the intelligence of non-English speaking or language different children.
<li>A group intelligence test score, although spurious, may still be a good predictor of school performance for some children.
<li>School achievement predicts future school performances as well as group intelligence tests, thus leaving little justification for relying on group intelligence tests.
<li>One of the most frequent abuses of group intelligence tests is the use of such tests with populations for which they are inappropriate.</ol><p>
    The Council goes on record in full support of the recommendations of the "Classification Project" (Nicholas Hobbs, The Futures of Children, 1975, pp. 237-239)pertaining to group intelligence testing as follows:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>"...That there be established a National Bureau of Standards for Psychological Tests and Testing."
<li>That there be established "minimum guidelines with respect to the utilization of psychological tests for the classification of children."
<li>"That organizations that make extensive use of educational and psychological tests...should establish review boards to monitor their testing programs."</ol><p>
    Until these three recommendations are accomplished, The Council encourages a moratorium, on the use of group intelligence tests by individual school districts for the purpose of identifying children with exceptionalities. (Chapter 03. Para. 13)<p>


<b>Minimal Competency Testing</b><p>

While most students with exceptional needs have been assured of their right to public education along with their peers, they have not been similarly assured of the opportunity to complete their education, graduate and receive a diploma signifying their ac







hievement.  There exist considerable variations and inconsistencies within and among the states and provinces regarding graduation requirements for pupils with exceptional needs and the procedures for their receiving, or not receiving, a diploma.<p>
An emerging issue that compounds these variations and inconsistencies is the minimal competency testing movement, which uses established test results as standards for the granting of diplomas or for the determination of grade placement.  Unless educationa







l policies in this area are formulated in order to resolve these inconsistencies, eliminate potentially discriminatory practices, and assure that graduation and grade placement requirements are equitably applied to all students, many of the educational ga







ins made by pupils with exceptional needs could be threatened or delayed.<p>
The Council believes that educational policies governing minimal competency testing and graduation and/or grade placement requirements for pupils with exceptional needs should be developed at the state, provincial, and local levels.  These policies should







 incorporate the following principles:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Every pupil with exceptional needs should have available the opportunity to demonstrate minimal competency.
<li>Alternative methods of minimal competency testing and the demonstration of minimal competency should be available to pupils with exceptional needs to assure that the competency level is being tested rather than the exceptionality.
<li>The Individualized Education Program (IEP)should be the vehicle for individually addressing the method by which each pupil with exceptional needs may demonstrate minimal competency standards and/or any differential standards that may be used.
<li>The application of minimal competency testing programs to pupils with exceptional needs should provide for adequate phase-in periods and educational preparation time.
<li>A minimal competency testing program for students with exceptional needs should provide successive opportunities to demonstrate competency, as well as adequate and appropriate remedial programs to address areas in which competency is not sufficiently 







demonstrated.
<li>Only one type of diploma should be granted to all students, and it should be accompanied by grade transcripts and/or course-of-study description.
<li>The successful implementation of a minimal competency testing program, including its application to pupils with exceptional needs, requires the cooperative efforts of regular educators, special educators, and parents in its planning, application , and







 evaluation. (Chapter 03, Para 14)</ol><p>

<center><b><a name="13">Ethnic and Multicultural Groups</b></center><p>

<b>Preamble</b><p>
The Council believes that all policy statements previously adopted by CEC related to children with and without exceptionalities, as well as children with gifts and talents, are relevant and applicable to both minority and nonminority individuals.  In orde







r to highlight concerns of special interest to members of ethnic and multicultural groups, the following policy statements have been developed. (Chapter 08, Para. 1)<p>

<b>Ethnicity and Exceptionality</b><p>
The Council recognizes the special and unique needs of members of ethnic and multicultural groups and pledges its full support toward promoting all efforts which will help to bring them into full and equitable participation and membership in the total soc







iety. (Chapter 08, Para. 2)<p>

<b>Identification, Testing,<br> and Placement</b><p>
The Council supports the following statements related to the identification , testing, and placement of children from ethnic and multicultural groups who are also exceptional.<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Child-find procedures should identify children by ethnicity as well as type and severity of exceptionality or degree of giftedness.
<li>Program service reporting procedures should identify children by ethnicity as well as exceptionality or degree of giftedness.
<li>All testing and evaluation materials and methods used for the classification and placement of children from ethnic and multicultural groups should be selected and administered so as not to be racially or culturally discriminatory.
<li>Children with exceptionalities who are members of ethnic and multicultural groups should be tested in their dominant language by examiners who are fluent in that language and familiar with the cultural heritage of the children being tested.
<li>Communication of test results with parents of children from ethnic and multicultural groups should be done in the dominant language of those parents and conducted by persons involved in the testing or familiar with the particular exceptionality, fluen







t in that language, and familiar with the cultural heritage of those parents.</ol><p>
    All levels of government should establish procedures to ensure that testing and evaluation materials and methods used for the purpose of classification and placement of children are selected and administered so as not to be linguistically, racially, o







r culturally discriminatory. (Chapter 08, Para. 3)<p>

<b>Programming and<br> Curriculum Adaptation</b><p>
The Council supports the following statements related to programming and curriculum adaptation for children from ethnic and multicultural groups:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Long-term placement should be avoided unless students are reevaluated at prescribed intervals by individuals qualified in assessing such students with the most appropriate culture-free assessment instruments available.
<li>All school districts should take necessary steps to ensure that both students and their parents fully comprehend the implications of and the reasons for proposed programming decisions, including the nature and length of placement.  Parents should be f







ully involved in the decision making process.
<li>Culturally appropriate individualized education programs should be designed that include the child's present level of educational performance, annual goals, short-term objectives, and specific educational services to be provided.  
<li>It is of utmost importance to identify children's relative language proficiency so that language appropriate special education programs may be provided (e.g., bilingual special education and special education programs incorporating English-as-a-Second







-Language instruction).
<li>Children with exceptionalities who are members of ethnic and multicultural groups should have access to special cultural and language programs provided to nonexceptional group members, with the necessary program adaptations to make the program benefic







ial to the exceptional child or youth.
<li>Culturally appropriate educational materials should be readily available in ample quantity so that all students, including those from ethnic and multicultural groups, may benefit from their content.
<li>Curriculum should be adapted or developed to meet the unique needs of children  from all cultural groups.  Curriculum should include a multicultural perspective that recognize the value of diverse cultural traditions to society as well as the contribu







tions of all cultural groups of American and Canadian society.
<li>  It is critical for teachers to recognize individual language and cultural differences as assets rather than deficits.  Furthermore, those assets should be utilized to enhance education for all children, including those from ethnic and multicultural 







groups. (Chapter 08, Para 4)</ol><p>

<b>Technical Assistance and Training</b><p>
Special and unique concerns of Council members from ethnic and multicultural groups that are related to technical assistance, training, and services will receive the attention and support of the Special Assistant to the Executive Director for Ethnic and M







ulticultural Concerns. (Chapter 08, Para. 5)<p>

<b>Special Projects</b><p>
<ol type=a>
<li>The Council will continue its interests in projects that meet the needs and concerns of all its membership.  Furthermore, The Council will actively search for projects that include special concerns of members from ethnic and multicultural groups.
<li>Projects that include special and unique concerns of members from ethnic and multicultural groups to be considered for development and implementation will receive the combined attention and support of various Council staff and the Special Assistant to







 the Executive Director for Ethnic and Multicultural Concerns.
<li>All projects of The Council will include opportunities for perspective and participation by ethnic and multicultural groups in formulation, implementation, and evaluation phases. (Chapter 08, Para. 6)</ol><p>
<b>Cooperation with Organizations, Disciplines, and Individuals</b><p>
<ol type=a>
<li>The Council will support efforts to explore with other organizations mutual concerns and issues related to ethnic and multicultural children and their families.  In the process, The Council will take care not to intervene in the internal affairs of an







y of the other organizations.
<li>The Council will support efforts to work cooperatively with other organizations in activities and services related to children with exceptionalities from ethnic and multicultural groups and their families.  (Chapter 08, Para. 7 )</ol><p>

<b>Migrant Exceptional Students</b><p>
Exceptional students who are mobile due to their parents' migrant employment, experience reduced opportunities for an appropriate education and a reduced likelihood of completing their education.  Child-find and identification policies and practices, desi







gned for a stationary population, are inadequate for children who move frequently.  Incomplete, delayed, or inadequate transfer of records seriously impedes educational continuity.  Interstate/provincial differences in special education eligibility requir







ements, programs and resources, minimum competency testing, and graduation requirements result in repetition of processing formalities, gaps in instruction, delays in the resumption of services, an inability to accumulate  credits for graduation, and othe







r serious inequities.  In addition to the disruption of learning, mobility disrupts health care, training, teacher-student rapport, and personal relationships.<p>
    The Council believes that educational policies and practices should be developed at federal, state/provincial, and local levels to improve access to education for migrant children and youth with exceptionalities.  these policies should include:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>A national system for the maintenance and transferal of special education records for migrant students with exceptionalities.
<li>Intrastate/provincial and interstate/provincial cooperation in the transfer of records and of credits.
<li>Flexibility in high school credit accumulation for migrant students with exceptionalities.
<li>Joint planning, coordination, and shared responsibility among special education, migrant education, bilingual education, and related programs.
<li>Funding patterns that adjust for variations in enrollment.
<li>Flexible scheduling and other programming options that adjust for student mobility.
<li>Routine monitoring of activities undertaken to identify the migrant exceptional student and to ensure educational continuity.  
<li>Ongoing research efforts to promote, improve, support, and evaluate the education of migrant students with exceptionalities.
<li>Personnel training.
<li>Parent and family information programs to facilitate record transfer. (Chapter 02, Para. 11)</ol><p>

<center><b><a name="14">Career Education<br> and Transition</b></center><p>
<b>Responsibilities for Providing <br>Continuing Education Services <br>to Exceptional Youth</b><p>
The Council believes that education is a lifelong process and that, instead of age, competency and maximal development should be the terminating factor with regard to formal schooling.  It also believes that individuals with learning problems, particularl







y exceptional youth, frequently need education and periodic reeducation beyond the traditional school attendance ages to encourage their continuing development.  These options might include post secondary education, vocational education, job training, emp







loyment counseling, community living skills, and placement services in order to maximize their ability to contribute to society. (Chapter 02, Para. 10)<p>

<b>Career Education</b><p>
Career education is the totality of experience through which one learns to live a meaningful, satisfying work life.  Within the career education framework, work is conceptualized as conscious effort aimed at producing benefits for oneself and/or others.  







Career education provides the opportunity for children to learn, in the least restrictive environment possible, the academic, daily living, personal-social and occupational knowledge, and specific vocational skills necessary for attaining their highest le







vels of economic, personal, and social fulfillment.  The individual can obtain this fulfillment though work (both paid and unpaid) and in a variety of other social roles and personal lifestyles, including his or her pursuits as a student, citizen,  volunt







eer family member, and participant in meaningful leisure time activities.<p>
    Children with exceptionalities (i.e., those whose characteristics range from profoundly and severely disabled to those who are richly endowed with talents and/or intellectual giftedness) include individuals whose career potentials range from sheltered







 to competitive work and living arrangements.  Children with exceptionalities require career education experiences which will develop to the fullest extent possible their wide range of abilities, needs, and interests.<p>
    It is the position of The Council that individualized appropriate education for children with exceptionalities must include the opportunity for every student to attain his or her highest level of career potential through career education experiences. 







 Provision for these educational experiences must be reflected in an individualized education program for each exceptional child that must include the following:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Nondiscriminatory, ongoing assessment of career interests, needs, and potentials which assures recognition of the strengths of the individual which can lead to a meaningful, satisfying career in a work-oriented society.  Assessment materials and proce







dures must not be discriminatory on the basis of race, sex, national  origin, or exceptionality.
<li>Career awareness, exploration, preparation, and placement, experiences in the least restrictive school, living, and community environments that focus on the needs of the exceptional individual from early childhood through adulthood.
<li>Specification and utilization of community and other services related to the career development of exceptional individuals (e.g., rehabilitation, transportation, industrial and business, psychological).
<li>Involvement of parents or guardians and the exceptional student in career education planning.</ol><p>
    Career education must not be viewed separately from the total curriculum.  Rather, career education permeates the entire school program and even extends beyond it.  It should be an infusion throughout the curriculum by knowledgeable teachers who modif







y the curriculum to integrate career development goals with current subject matter, goals, and content,  It should prepare individuals for the several life roles that make up an individual's career.  These life roles may include an economic role, a commun







ity role, a home role, an avocational role, a religious or moral role, and an aesthetic role.  Thus, career education is concerned with the total person and his or her adjustment for community working and living.  (Chapter 03, Para. 20)<p>

<b>Special Education's Responsibilities <br>to Adults with Disabilities-Preamble</b><p>
The Council believes that most students can learn to become contributing citizens, family members, employees, learners, and active participants in meaningful vocational, recreational, and leisure pursuits.  We believe, therefore, that it is an important p







urpose of education to assist students in the attainment of such outcomes.  Further, we believe that education from early childhood through adult education should focus on assuring that students with exceptionalities attain such outcomes. (Chapter 09, Par







a. 1)<p>

<b>Collaborative Responsibilities</b><p>
In order to assist students with exceptionalities to become productive workers and independent adults, special education should work in collaboration with adult service agencies to influence the provision of needed services from such agencies.  Collaborat







ion should include:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Working with postsecondary vocational/technical institutions, adult education, rehabilitation, and independent living centers that assess, train, and places persons with exceptionalities in meaningful work situations.
<li>Interaction and collaboration to provide  relevant information to agencies and organizations that will assist them to conduct job site assessments, training follow-up, and continuing training or education for persons with exceptionalities. 
<li>Assisting appropriate special educators to become knowledgeable about their community's labor market needs and build close working relationships and partnerships with the business and industrial sector so that receptivity toward potential employees wi







th exceptionalities is increased.
<li>Promotion of adult and continuing education and literacy service opportunities for adults with exceptionalities.
<li>Conducting systematic follow-up studies on former students so that curriculum and instruction can be appropriately modified to be responsive to employment and independent living needs.
<li>Advocating the elimination of attitudinal and physical barriers that reduce the ability of these individuals to fully participate in society and increase vocational, recreational, and leisure opportunities.
<li>Supporting the participation of special educators on advisory committees and in staff development and inservice training programs of agencies. organizations, and the business and industrial sector that address the needs of adults with exceptionalities







 and how they can be met.
<li>Promoting an early, close working relationship with adult service agency personnel, so secondary students can be provided more successful transition from school to adult life, and advocating for the provision of needed adult services by these agencies

	The Foundation for Exceptional Children (FEC) is a national organization committed to improving the 
lives of children and youth with disabilities.  For 26 years, the Foundation's mission has been to design 
and implement programs that help to improve the quality of life of children and youth with disabilities.  FEC, 
through the administration of several national programs and through personal contact with organizations 
participating in these programs has recognized a pattern of need.<p> 
<b>Organizational Background and Capacity</b><p> 
	The Foundation for Exceptional Children was created as a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization 
in June, 1971.  The mission of the Foundation is to encourage, enhance and empower children and youth with 
disabilities and/or gifted and talented children to obtain their greatest potential.  The Foundation's objectives are: 
to encourage children and youth with disabilities to achieve to the best of their abilities and to recognize the 
achievement of these persons; to promote quality education and assist youth with disabilities to successfully 
make the transition from school to adult life and to succeed in competitive employment, independent living and a 
higher quality of life; to raise the awareness of the general public to the value, worth and abilities of children and 
youth with disabilities and to strive toward empowerment of persons with disabilities to attain a high quality of 
life through removal of barriers, better education, advocacy and involvement in general social activities.<p> 
	The Foundation is an organization small in staff numbers but large in national impact. It has initiated 
and administered many programs to achieve its objectives including:<p> 
	<b>Conference on the Culturally Gifted Child</b>--a national conference to develop guidelines for 
creation of programs which would help all gifted children reach their greatest potential with a special sensitivity 
for the need and abilities of gifted children from minority groups.<p> 
	<b>A Primer on Individualized Education Programs for Handicapped Children</b>-developed and 
published a text in order to provide special and general educators with an understanding of the elements of the 
Individualized Education Program (IEP) for handicapped children as required by Public Law 94-142.  The 
Education for All Handicapped Children Act.<p> 
	<b>Incarcerated Handicapped Youth Project</b>-a technical assistance 
project in two penal institutions 
in the Washington, D.C. area for the purpose of improving educational programs for 1500 local youth 
incarcerated in juvenile facilities<p> 
	<b>"Yes I Care!"</b>-recognizes adults for their special commitment and achievement in support of all 
disabled youth.  Senators Harkin and Dole have received the award in recognition of their sponsorship of the 
ADA legislation.<p> 
	The <b>"Yes I Can!"</b> program provides International awards for 
achievement in academics, the arts, 
independent living, athletics, community service, employment, and 
extracurricular activities.  This International 
program has been funded by the Shell Oil Company Foundation, Fearon Corporation, and the Neil Smith 
Foundation.  The budget includes a replica of a statue designed by a nationally known sculptor, Michael 
Naranjo, which is presented to each of the winners.  The nominees are recruited through the media and print 
journals.  The winners are chosen by a committee and are invited to the 
national convention of the Council for 
Exceptional Children, an organization for teachers of special education. The statues are presented in a special 
ceremony which often includes television and cinema personalities as well as professional athletes.  A reception 
is held to honor the winners, parents and teachers of the winners.  All students nominated are recognized with a 
certificate from FEC.  At this time more than 20,000 children and youth have been recognized through this 
program.<p> 
	<b>Team Work </b>is a national program which helps prepare and find jobs for youth with disabilities 
by pairing them with volunteer mentors from business and industry.  The $250,000 start up budget was funded 
by four foundations with continuing support from more than 50 corporations and foundations.  Some major 
contributors were the Pew Trust, Dole Foundation, Knight Foundation and the Mitsubishi Electric America 
Foundation.   It was designed to be replicating and self-sustaining.  The project is presently on going at 10-12 
different sites across the nation, and is used as management model for the YESS Program.<p> 
	The <b>Scholarship Program</b> administered by FEC annually awards 
scholarships of $500-$1,000 
each to students with disabilities.  This program has been funded by General Motors Corporation and by private 
donations.<p> 
	<b>Minigrants</b> is a national program which provides funds to schools, community groups, and 
other centers of learning for innovative educational programs.  The Dreyfus Foundation and the Union Carbide 
Corporation, among others, support the program.  Between 20 and 30 grants are awarded annually.<p> 
	The FEC is partnered with the University of New Mexico to act as a <b>Clearing house for Funding 
Sources in Special Education</b>, and to assist predominantly minority colleges and universities.  The FEC 
prepared and published a book which describes foundations and organizations that fund projects for special 
education.  The book is regularly updated.  It was through personal contact with organizations participating in 
the TEAMWORK project and other organizations using the clearinghouse that FEC recognized a pattern of need 
among disabled youth.  The University of New Mexico project is federally supported at the rate of 
approximately $1.3 million dollars per year.<p>

<b>General Information and Eligibility Requirements</b><p>

Post-secondary education or training includes two and four year undergraduate college programs or vocational, technical or fine arts training programs.<p> 
 
The <b>Stanley E. Jackson Scholarship Awards</b> honor Stanley E. Jackson.  Mr. Jackson was a pioneer and leader in the special education community.  The <b>Infinitec Scholarship Award</b> is sponsored by Infinitec, Inc., a joint project of United Cerebral Palsy Association of Greater Chicago and UCPA, Inc., the national organization.  The aim of Infinitec, Inc. is to enable people with disabilities to gain access to technologies that advance independence.<P>

<b>Applicants must be anticipating enrollment for the first time in full-time, post-secondary education or training during 1996-1997 and provide evidence of financial need.  </b>Different recipients will be selected for

	group, such as Afro-American, Hispanic, Native American or 			Asian.<p> 
<b>Award #5:</b>	Applicant must use an augmentative communication device or other technology-based alternative to oral communication.  Qualifying communications devices and systems range along a continuum from simple picture boards to highly complex computer-based systems.<p>

following material:<p> 
<ul> 
<li>	Completed Scholarship Application form (2 copies)

All materials must be <b>postmarked no later than February 1, 1997 
</b>and sent to the Foundation for 
Exceptional Children, 1920 Association Drive, Reston, VA  20191.<p> 
	 
The confidentiality of all information provided will be respected.  All applicants will be notified as to the 
outcome of their application. <b> None of the application materials will be returned.  Additional materials (e.g.,
art work, samples of writing, tapes, videos etc.) will not be considered in the process of evaluating the 
application.</b><p> 
 
Multiple scholarship awards will be made in each of the following categories.<p> 
 
Award #1:	Scholarship Award for Students with Disabilities<br> 
Award #2:	Scholarship Award for Ethnic Minority Students with 			
	Disabilities<br> 
Award #3:	Scholarship Award for Gifted/Talented Students with

By completing this application a student will receive consideration for one of the five scholarship categories 
whose eligibility criteria are met. <b> APPLY IN ONLY ONE CATEGORY.</b>  Different recipients will be 
selected for each award category.  No person will receive more than one award.<p> 
  
<b>ASSEMBLE  INFORMATION  INTO  TWO  COMPLETE  SETS:</b><p>

statement, and each transcript.  If transcripts are being sent separately by an institution, the Foundation will 
attach the transcripts.)<p>

categories), applicants should complete only those questions which are relevant to their circumstances, or to the 
category of award to which they are applying.<p>

1997  Program</center><p> 
 
<b>Purpose:</b>		The Foundation for Exceptional Children established the Yes I Can!  
			program in 1981 to acknowledge the achievements of children and 
			youth with disabilities; to overcome barriers caused by disabilities or 
			public misconceptions; to encourage children and youth with disabilities 
			to seek their highest potential; and to increase public awareness of the  
			abilities, aspirations, and personal qualities of disabled people.<p> 
 
			Each year children and youth with disabilities are recognized for their 
			accomplishments through the international Yes I Can! program.<p> 
 
<b>Recognition:</b>		Nominees for the Yes I Can! Award Program will be recognized in one 
			of the following categories:<p> 
		<ul> 
		<li> Academics		<li> Arts		<li> Athletics (to include Motor Skills) 
		 
		<li> Community Service    <li> Employment    <li> Extracurricular Activities 
 
		<li>  Independent Living Skills (include Self Care Skills)</ul><p> 
 
Thirty-five international award winners will be recognized and given special awards at the CEC Annual 
Convention in the Spring of 1997 in Salt Lake City, Utah.<p> 
 
<b>ALL PERSONS NOMINATED FOR THE YES I CAN! PROGRAM WILL RECEIVE A CERTIFICATE 
OF ACHIEVEMENT PERSONALLY INSCRIBED WITH HIS/HER NAME.</b><p> 
 
<b>TO NOMINATE:</b>	Nominees for the Yes I Can! Award program must be 2-21 years old. 
		Each nominee is eligible in one ONE category.  Both nominators must  
		select the same category or nomination will be considered incomplete by 
		the Yes I Can! Selection Committee.<p>

YES  I  CAN!  GUIDELINES</b></center><p> 
 
 
If you would like to nominate a youth or child with a disability for a Yes I Can! Award, please follow the 
directions below:<p> 
<ol> 
<li>	Each applicant must be nominated by TWO people.  Each nomination form must  
	be individually completed and should provide specific information about the  
	nominee.  A form completed by one person and duplicated as the second 
	form will not be accepted.  One of the nominators should be other than a family 
	member. <p> 
 
<li>	Nominee must be selected in one category only and in the same category by 
	both nominators.  Failure to do so will result in an incomplete form and will not 
	be judged by the Selection Committee for the international awards. <p> 
 
 
<li>	Please print or type all information.  It is extremely difficult for the Selection 
	Committee to judge forms that are not legible. <p> 
 
 
<li>	Answer ALL questions. <p> 
 
 
<li>	Photos and news clippings which help to support the nomination are encouraged 
	and may be submitted.  Please do not send video or cassette tapes.  Due to 
	the large volume of nominations received, the Selection Committee does not have 
	the time to view these tapes.  None of the additional material submitted with the 
	application will be returned. <p> 
 
 
<li>	Please be sure to check the box on the nomination form that will indicate which 
	nominator should receive the certificate to present to the nominee.  Certificates 
	will not be sent directly to the nominee. <p> 

 
<li>	Nomination forms must be postmarked no later than January 6, 1997. <p> 
 
 
<li>	Whenever possible, both nomination forms should be returned together.

<H3><CENTER> <b><I> Submitting Documents to ERIC </b></I>
</center></H3><P>
If you have recently written a paper related to the education of the gifted or of people
with disabilities, your work can be made available through ERIC.  We are interested in
receiving all types of substantive documents, including research reports, program
descriptions or evaluations, literature reviews, curriculum guides, and conference
papers.  <p>

<B> Why Submit Your Document to ERIC? </B><br>
Contributors of documents to ERIC can benefit in the following ways:
<ul><li> <b>Announcement</B>--Documents accepted by ERIC are announced to
some 2,000 organizations receiving the abstract journal <I> Resources in Education
</I> (RIE).<p>
<li> <b>Publicity</B>--Organizations that wish to sell their own documents in original
copies can announce availability and price information in RIE, thus publicizing their
product.  After the document is sold out at the original source, it is still available through
EDRS (ERIC Document Reproduction Service), if ERIC has received permission to
reproduce it.<p>
<li> <b>Dissemination</B>--Documents accepted by ERIC are reproduced on
microfiche and distributed to more than 900 groups that subscribe to the ERIC
microfiche collection. </I> <p>
<li> <b>Retrievability</B>--ERIC citations can be retrieved by the thousands of
subscribers to online information retrieval services such as Knight-Ridder (DIALOG),
OCLC, and CD+.  In addition, thousands of locations offer ERIC searches via
CD-ROM.<p>
<li> <b>Always "In Print"</B>--Once a document is on microfiche at EDRS, it never
goes out of print.  Copies can be made on an on-demand basis.</UL><p>

<B>What Kinds of Documents Can You Submit to ERIC?</B><br>
ERIC welcomes documents on nearly any aspect of education to satisfy its
broad audience, which includes teachers, administrators, supervisors, librarians,
researchers, media specialists, counselors, and every other type of educator, as well as
students and parents.  The following are examples of the types of materials ERIC
collects: <P>
<TABLE WIDTH=600 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>

<TD WIDTH=275> 
Bibliographies, Annotated Bibliographies</td> <TD WIDTH=275>

<tr><td> Vocabularies, Dictionaries, Glossaries, Thesauri </tr></table> <P>

ERIC has recently begun to accept nonprint materials (such as audiotapes, data files,
films, software, videotapes).  Formerly, such materials were not collected
either because they were copyrighted and could not be reproduced, or their storage
and duplication posed problems.  However, ERIC now accepts various
nonprint items, as long as they are available from a reliable source.  ERIC itself
does not reproduce or distribute such nonprint materials. <P>

<B>How Are Documents Selected for the ERIC Database?</B><br>
Documents submitted to ERIC are evaluated by subject experts according to the
following criteria:<P>

<TABLE WIDTH=600 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH=275> 
<tr><td>Substantive information (5 pages or more)</td>
<td>Contribution to knowledge </td></tr>
<tr><td>Comprehensiveness</td>
<td> Clear writing style</td></tr>
<tr><td> Timeliness</td>
<td> Sound methodology (for research)</td></tr>
<tr><td> Adequate references</td>
<td>Effectiveness of presentation</td></tr>
<tr><td>Relation to current priorities </td>
<td>Intended audience</td></tr></table> <p>

<b>Legibility and Reproducibility</B><BR>
Your documents may be typeset, typewritten, photocopied, or otherwise duplicated.  They
must be legible and easily readable.  If possible, please submit documents on standard 8" x 11" white paper. <P>

We'll need two copies of your document: one for processing into the system and
eventual filming, and one for retention and use while
processing is taking place.<P>

<B> Reproduction Release </B> <BR>
For each document you submit, we'll need a formal signed <a href="reprofrm.htm"> Reproduction
Release Form</a> indicating whether or not ERIC may reproduce the document.  

For further information, please contact <a

<h3><CENTER><B><I>The ERIC/OSEP Special Project </B></I></CENTER></h3>

Through ERIC EC, CEC also operates the ERIC/OSEP Special Project, which
disseminates special education research through a variety of publications and
conferences.  Audiences include teachers and related services professionals, trainers,
administrators, policymakers, researchers, families, and others who are involved in the
development and delivery of special education services. <P>

The ERIC/OSEP Special Project tracks current research, plans and coordinates
research conferences, and develops publications that summarize recent research on
critical issues and topics.  These publications include an <a href="rsrchdir.htm">annual directory of research
projects</a> as well as publications that synthesize research efforts. <P>

Each year, the Special Project hosts a conference for directors of OSEP-sponsored
research projects.  Throughout the year, research forums and work groups are held that
bring together experts on emerging topics of interest.  Focus groups representing the
Special Project's audiences are held to inform OSEP and the Special Project of
information needs and to enhance the utility of publications produced by the Special
Project and other dissemination groups. <P>

The ERIC/OSEP Special Project is funded under a three-party contract among The
Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), the Office of Special Education Programs
(OSEP), and the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI), U.S.
Department of Education.  Under this contract, OSEP funds the ERIC/OSEP Special
Project, and OERI funds the ERIC Clearinghouse on Disabilities and Gifted
Education.<P>

Each year, thousands of children are identified as having a learning disability, and many more fail in school because of difficulties in learning to read.  A new analysis of decades of research about how young children can best learn to read indicates that, in most cases, these difficulties can be prevented, according to the National Center  to Improve the Tools of Educators (NCITE), based at the University of Oregon. 
The results of the synthesis funded by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) have been released through the <I><B>Learning to Read, Reading to Learn</b></i> public awareness campaign.<P>

The ERIC Clearinghouse on Disabilities and Gifted Education (ERIC EC), its host organization, The Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), and the ERIC Clearinghouse on Reading, English, and Communication (ERIC CS) at Indiana University are among the 25 partner organizations that will provide information about this reading research.<P>

A network of researchers who can act as resources has been established.  These researchers can provide technical assistance for schools trying to create an effective reading program for children with learning disabilities.  A list of these researchers is also provided. <P>

Some of the materials included in the information kit are listed below:<P>

<H3>About <I>The Life Centered Career Education Curriculum (LCCE)</H3></I>
<I><BR> 
LCCE </I>is an education system designed to provide special education and other "at risk" students with the 
important skills needed to function successfully as productive workers in the school, home, and community. The 
LCCE materials are grounded in 15 years of research. They have been field-tested in schools across the country 
and adopted by many school districts as the preferred transition curriculum.<BR> 
     <BR> 
The LCCE approach addresses the question, "What skills must the individual have to become a participating 
member of society?" Based on extensive and continued research, 22 major skills or competencies have been 
identified as critical for students to acquire for adult success. The 22 competencies fall under one of three 
curriculum areas: <BR> 
     Daily Living Skills, <BR> 
     Personal-Social Skills, <BR> 
     Occupational Guidance and Preparation.<BR> 
     <BR> 
Instruction of the 22 competency areas is organized into four stages of career development in a scope and 
sequence that begins with career/self-
awareness and continues through career exploration, preparation, and assimilation. Although much of the 
instruction will occur in school, considerable home- and community-based experiences are emphasized. The 
curriculum includes over 1,100 lesson plans. Knowledge and Performance Batteries have also been developed to 
assess student performance.<BR> 
     <BR> 
The LCCE competency units satisfy functional objectives that are an important part of Individualized Education 
Programs and Transition Plans for students with disabilities. In addition, the specificity of the lesson plans 
enables teachers to easily implement the Life Centered Career Education approach in their communities and 
classrooms. <p>

Special education professionals participate with other professionals and with parents in an interdisciplinary effort in the management of behavior. Professionals:<BR>

The professional will not be required to administer medication.<BR>
<li> Professionals note and report to those concerned whenever changes in behavior occur in conjunction with the administration of medication or at any other time.<P>

Parent Relationships<P>
Professionals seek to develop relationships with parents based on mutual respect for their roles in achieving benefits for the exceptional person. Special education professionals:<BR>

<li> Recognize that the relationship of home and community environmental conditions affects the behavior and outlook of the exceptional person.<BR>
</ol>
Advocacy<p>
Special education professionals serve as advocates for exceptional students by speaking, writing, and acting in a variety of situations on their behalf. They:<BR>

</ol>
Assignment and Role<BR>
<ol>
<li> Professionals should receive clear written communication of all duties and responsibilities, including those which are prescribed as conditions of their employment.<BR>
<li> Professionals promote educational quality and intra- and interprofessional cooperation through active participation in the planning, policy development, management, and evaluation of the special education program and the education program at large so that programs remain responsive to the changing needs of persons with exceptionalities.<BR>

<li> Adequate supervision of and support for special education professionals is provided by other professionals qualified by their training and experience in the area of concern.<BR>
<li> The administration and supervision of special education professionals provides for clear lines of accountability.<BR>

</ol>
Professional Development<BR>
<ol>
<li> Special education professionals systematically advance their knowledge and skills in order to maintain a high level of competence and response to the changing needs of persons with exceptionalities by pursuing a program of continuing education including but not limited to participation in such activities as inservice training, professional conferences/workshops, professional meetings, continuing education courses, and the reading of professional literature.<BR>
<li> Professionals participate in the objective and systematic evaluation of themselves, colleagues, services, and programs for the purpose of continuous improvement of professional performance.<BR>

<li> Special education professionals take an active position in the regulation of the profession through use of appropriate procedures for bringing about changes.<BR>
<li> Special education professionals initiate, support, and/or participate in research related to the education of persons with exceptionalities with the aim of improving the quality of educational services, increasing the accountability of programs, and generally benefiting persons with exceptionalities.

<ol>
<li> Recognize and acknowledge the competencies and expertise of members representing other disciplines as well as those of members in their own disciplines.<BR>
<li> Strive to develop positive attitudes among other professionals toward persons with exceptionalities, representing them with an objective regard for their possibilities and their limitations as persons in a democratic society.<BR>
<li> Cooperate with other agencies involved in serving persons with exceptionalities through such activities as the planning and coordination of information exchanges, service delivery, evaluation, and training, so that duplication or loss in quality of services may occur.<BR>
<li> Provide consultation and assistance, where appropriate, to both regular and special educators as well as other school personnel serving persons with exceptionalities.<BR>
<li> Provide consultation and assistance, where appropriate, to professionals in nonschool settings serving persons with exceptionalities.<BR>

CEC Common Core of Knowledge and Skills Essential for All Beginning Special Education Teachers<p>
Preamble<P>
The standards of the profession of special education are a formally codified set of beliefs. These belief statements represent the special educator's principles of appropriate ethical behavior and are based on several assumptions.<p>
One assumption is that special education has within its heritage the perspectives of advocacy for persons with disabilities and of embracing individual differences. These differences include the traditional consideration of the nature and effect of exceptionalities. As the community of exceptional children, youth, and adults has become increasingly diverse, these perspectives have been broadened to include other characteristics that significantly influence their quality of life. To maintain their ability to successfully function as advocates for their multicultural clients, special educators must broaden their perspectives to ensure vigilant attention to the issues of diversity. Current demographic trends clearly indicate that:<BR>
<ul>
<li> The numbers of children and youth from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds served in public schools are growing rapidly.<BR>
<li> Cultural and linguistic diversity is expected to continue as well as to increase.<BR>
<li> The number of professionals who are culturally and linguistically diverse entering the special education profession has been declining even as the numbers of students who are culturally and linguistically diverse are rising.<p>
</ul>
Given the pervasive nature of diversity, professional standards are needed that guide professional practice in ways that are relevant to the multicultural populations served in special education. Specifically, these standards reflect the premise that, to design effective interventions, special educators must understand the characteristics of their learners, including factors such as culture, language, gender, religion, and sexuality. This premise has been addressed in two ways. First, most statements are inclusive in nature; that is, they identify knowledge and skills essential to effectively serve all exceptional learners, including those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Second, selected items address the most critical aspects of diversity and are infused throughout the model.<p>
Another assumption is that the sustained involvement of families and the larger community is fundamental to delivering high-quality educational services to individuals with exceptional learning needs. The knowledge and skills contained in this document should be interpreted broadly to include learners of all ages, beginning with infants and preschoolers and extending to young adults who are exiting the school program. Similarly, the term families should be interpreted broadly to include, as appropriate to given situations, biological mothers and fathers, adoptive parents, legal guardians, foster parents or primary caregivers, siblings, and extended family members. Finally, while not specifically stated, it is assumed that special educators may provide learning opportunities in a variety of learning environments, including the home, preschool, school, and community settings, as well as in both specialized and integrated environments.<p>
This document focuses on the unique set of knowledge and skills needed to practice in special education, not on specific areas of exceptionality or age groupings, general educational methods, or subject matter content. Special educators who practice in a specific area (or areas) of exceptionality or age grouping must possess the exceptionality-specific knowledge and skills adopted by CEC in addition to the Common Core. Also, it is assumed that a special educator who is required to teach specific subjects or content areas (such as science, social studies, foreign languages, vocational education) has additional preparation, practicum experiences, and expertise in those areas.<p>
An additional assumption is that this Common Core of Knowledge and Skills will change over time. As with the adoption of the CEC Code of Ethics, time should be provided for continuing examination, debate, and further articulation of the knowledge and skills for entry-level special educators.<p>
A final assumption of this Common Core of Knowledge and Skills is that the professional conduct of entry-level special educators is governed foremost by the CEC Code of Ethics. Special education professionals<p>
<ul>
<li> Are committed to developing the highest educational and quality of life potential of exceptional individuals.<BR>
<li> Promote and maintain a high level of competence and integrity in practicing their profession.<BR>
<li> Engage in professional activities that benefit exceptional individuals, their families, other colleagues, students or research subjects.<BR>
<li> Exercise objective professional judgment in the practice of their profession.<BR>
<li> Strive to advance their knowledge and skills regarding the education of exceptional individuals.<BR>
<li> Work within the standards and policies of their profession.<BR>
<li> Seek to uphold and improve, where necessary, the laws, regulations, and policies governing the delivery of special education and related services and the practice of their profession.<BR>
<li> Do not condone or participate in unethical or illegal acts, nor violate professional standards adopted by the Delegate Assembly of CEC.</ul><p>
It was through significant professional and personal commitment that the members of CEC crafted this product. In the process we learned not only about knowledge and skills but also about each other and developed a deep mutual respect. May those who use this Common Core of Knowledge and Skills experience that same mutual respect from all who serve children and their families.<P>

One article from every issue of <i>TEC</i> will be highlighted for electronic discussion among authors and readers on the World Wide Web. We anticipate this innovation will merge the best attributes of print publication and electronic communications technology to provide <i>TEC</i> readers with an important new benefit.<p>    The authors of our first <i>TEC</i> Author Online event are Pam Campbell, a professor at the University of Connecticut, and Jack Tierney, Executive Director of Educational Technologies, Inc. Their article <a href="campbell.htm">"How Teachers Can Use Technology to Collaborate on Teaching Effectively"</a> appears on pp. 4 to 8 of <i>TEACHING Exceptional Children</i>. We encourage everyone to read the article first, then join the authors and other readers online. We've designated November 4-22, 1996, as the dates for this online event.<p>    During this 3-week electronic event, visit the site as often as you like. We look forward to having you share your comments and experiences with authors Pam and Jack, as well as other <i>TEC</i> readers. We'll report on this historic event in a future issue of <i>CEC Today</i>.<p>

<h1>Careers in Special Education<BR>and Related Services</h1>

<hr><blockquote>
<b>"My greatest satisfaction is seeing the children in my class make real gains and knowing that I
have helped them get to where they need to be."</b><br><br>
<b>"The biggest challenge to me is working with so many different kids with such a variety of
needs."</b><br>
<b>- Ib‚ Crawley, Preschool Special Educator</b><br><p></blockquote><br>
<hr>
<em>Do you want to make a difference in the lives of students with special
needs?</em> Do you like working with children and youth? Are you searching for a career
that is a calling and not just a job? If you are interested in an opportunity to improve the lives of
children with disabilities, consider becoming a special education teacher or a related services
professional.<p> 
Professionals who teach and provide services to children with disabilities have challenging yet
rewarding careers. These professionals include special education teachers, school psychologists,
physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, school counselors,
school nurses, and school social workers. <p>
<b>The Students.</b> Students who receive special instruction and services vary greatly in their
needs.  Like all children, they differ from one another in ability, age, learning style, and
personality.  Such students have unique learning needs that may require special teaching
approaches, the use of adaptive materials, and other support services such as speech-language
therapy. Students with disabilities come from all cultural backgrounds and may even speak
another language.<p>
Some students have cognitive impairments, such as mental retardation, which can range from
mild to profound. Others have specific learning disabilities that are manifested in specific
cognitive impairments. Yet other students may have physical disabilities that limit mobility and
may require the use of wheelchairs or other assistive devices. Some students' impairments are
strictly sensory, such as hearing loss and vision impairments. Chronic health problems and
multiple disabilities can complicate learning potential for many of these youngsters.<p>
<b>The Professionals.</b> Special education and related services professionals in the public
schools provide specially designed instruction to individuals with disabilities from ages 3 to 21.
Some public schools also make available direct services to infants and toddlers, ages birth to 3. In
addition to the special education classroom teacher, there are school-based and/or contracted
physical therapists, speech-language pathologists, audiologists, occupational therapists, school
psychologists, and school social workers.  Their specialized services can also be provided in
hospitals, medical centers, private practice environments, and the child's own home.<p>
<b>The Law.</b> Federal legislation, reauthorized in 1991 and now called the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), requires that public schools provide appropriate instruction
and supportive services to meet the education, social, emotional, and vocational needs of students
with disabilities. To qualify for special education services, a student must have a unique learning
need that differs from other similarly aged students. This need is individually determined through
an interdisciplinary assessment, and the education and services to be provided are planned jointly
by the child's parents, teachers, other school professionals, and the students themselves if they are
able.<p>
<hr>
<h2>Consider a Professional Career in Teaching or Clinical Service</h2>
The following information provides an introduction and overview of careers that involve
working with youngsters who have disabilities. For more detailed information on a given field or
specialization, see the contact information for professional associations at the end of this article.
Even though these professions have been described separately, it is rare that these professionals
work with students with special needs independently. All of these professionals work with
families as a team to plan and implement the appropriate educational programs for their
students.<p>
<b>Audiologists</b> identify, assess, and provide treatment for hearing, balance, and related
disorders.  They also recommend and evaluate hearing aids and other types of assistive hearing
devices.  While the work is mainly diagnostic, some audiologists have experience with sign
language and  lip reading and can provide ongoing therapy/aural rehabilitation.<p>
<b>Occupational Therapists</b> are concerned with an individual's ability to fully participate in
desired life tasks and roles including school and/or work, self-care, and play/leisure, as
independently as possible. Using purposeful and age-appropriate activities the occupational
therapist assists children with disabilities to achieve important life tasks. Occupational therapists
also consult with families, teachers, care givers, and others to help facilitate the child's growth and
development within all of the environments in which children live.<p>
<b>Physical Therapists</b> provide treatment to relieve pain, limit or prevent permanent physical
disability, and improve the mobility of people who have an injury or a disease. Physical
therapists evaluate a person's medical history; test and measure their strength, range of motion,
and ability to function; and develop written treatment plans. Appropriate treatment could include
therapeutic exercise, joint mobilization and range-of-motion exercises, therapeutic massage, and
ambulation training. Traction, ultrasound, electrotherapy, hydrotherapy, and cold therapy may
also be a part of treatment programs. Physical therapists implement the appropriate treatment
plan, document progress, conduct periodic reevaluations, and modify treatment if necessary.<p>
<b>Rehabilitation Counselors</b> provide vocational services to students with disabilities in
order to enable that person to secure and retain suitable employment. These services can include
vocational counseling and guidance, vocational training, and selective job placement.<p>
<b>School Counselors</b> work with students, teachers, parents, and administrators to help
ensure that students' educational, vocational, and emotional needs are being met. School
counselors provide crisis intervention services and individual and group counseling to help all
students develop their educational, social, career, and personal strengths and become responsible
and productive citizens.<p>
<b>School Nurses</b> promote and monitor the health status of children. They identify
health-related problems that can be barriers to the learning process and assist in the removal of
these barriers.  School nurses focus on the prevention of illness and the early detection and
correction of health problems. They provide health assessments and develop and implement health
plans, such as initiating referral procedures and providing health counseling. They also implement
school health protocols, such as administering medications to children with special health
needs.<p>
<b>School Psychologists</b>  provide consultation to teachers and families, psychological
counseling, student assessments, crisis intervention, and other direct services to children with
learning, behavioral, and emotional problems, and their families. They also provide preventive
services to improve the climate for learning. In many cases, psychologists work with classroom
teachers to develop a behavior management plan for an individual student or for an entire
class.<p>
<b>School Social Workers</b> provide a link between home, school, and community. This
service enables students and their families to overcome social and personal problems which
impede learning. School social workers provide individual and group counseling, consultation to
teachers, and other services which help students cope with their disabilities. They collaborate
with community agencies and provide case management for students and families requiring
multiple services.<p>
<b>Special Education Teachers</b> provide instruction and adapt and develop materials to match
the learning styles, strengths, and special needs of each student. They work to ensure that students
with educational disabilities reach their learning potential. There are several specialty areas within
special education. These areas of specialization, which vary across the country, are
usually classified by disability category, such as teacher of students with learning disabilities or
teacher of students with physical disabilities. In some places, special education teachers are
categorized by the age of the child they serve, such as preschool special educator. In some
schools, special education classes may be made up of students who have different disabilities; in
others, the class may be designed for students who all have the same disability to varying
degrees. Now that more children and youth with disabilities are being served within the general
education classroom in their neighborhood school, special education teachers are also acting as
consultants to general education teachers, or are coteaching classes with them.<p>
<b>Speech-Language Pathologists</b> identify, assess, and provide treatment for communication
and swallowing function and their disorders. They evaluate overall speech, and receptive and
expressive language communicative abilities. They provide early speech-language intervention as
well as speech, language, and voice therapies. Pediatric communication disabilities are seen, for
example, in youngsters with developmental delays, cerebral palsy, learning disabilities, cleft lip and
palate, and traumatic (closed) head injury, among others.<p>
<hr>
<h2>Employment Opportunities are Excellent</h2>
There are shortages of special education teachers and related services professionals across the
nation.  In most states the demand for qualified teachers and related services professionals
exceeds the available supply. These shortages are projected to grow over the next
decade.<p>
Figure 1 (below) shows the number of teachers needed as of 1991-92 (the most current data
available), to work with students with various disabilities. As can be seen, the most serious
shortages are for teachers of children with specific learning disabilities, teachers of children with
speech and/or language impairments, teachers of students with mental retardation, and teachers of
students with serious emotional disturbances. <p>

Shortages of special educators and related services personnel have continued to rise over the
last few years, including shortages of qualified professionals available to provide services to young
children (ages birth to 5). Vacancies vary by state, according to the type of teacher-professional
needed and the regions within the state. Generally, rural areas have need for professionals across
all areas of special education and related services. There is a need in all areas for culturally and
ethnically diverse professionals, particularly in urban areas; there is also a high need for
professionals who are bilingual. To try to minimize personnel shortages, many states operate
employment clearinghouses or placement services that match professionals looking for jobs with
educational settings that have positions available. Information about these services is available
from the<a href="mailto:ncpse@cec.sped.org"> NCPSE</a><p>

<h2>Working with Young Children - The Multidisciplinary Team</h2>
A variety of professionals provide services to children with disabilities from birth to age five.
They include early childhood special education teachers, physical therapists, occupational
therapists, speech-language pathologists, nutritionists, psychologists, physicians, and nurses.
These professionals work together as a team with young children who have early developmental
delays and their families. Early intervention aims to prevent or lessen the educational impact of
these disabilities. <p>
<h2>Working with Older Students - Preparing for Life After High School</h2>
Some school personnel work with secondary school students with disabilities to prepare these
students to transition into life after high school.  Career education, vocational education,
work-study programs, transition planning, college-planning, and community-based training are all
programs designed to help students with disabilities move into independent living. Federal
legislation mandates that every eligible student have transition services as part of their program
no later than age 16 and when appropriate, beginning at age 14 or younger. <p>
<h2>Preparation </h2>
Becoming a special education or related services professional requires specialized professional
education and skills.  At least a bachelor's degree is required to become a special education
teacher. To be licensed in some states, a graduate (master's) degree may also be required.
Professional preparation includes course work, clinical and field experience with children with
disabilities, and student (practicum) teaching. The types of professional preparation programs
offered in colleges and universities can vary widely but generally lead to eligibility for special
education teacher certification in the state where the program is offered. However, not all special
education specialty areas are offered by all university special education programs. Information
about specific programs can be obtained from the National Clearinghouse for Professions in
Special Education. You should also contact the department of special education in the college or
university of your choice to discuss course and career options open to you.<p>
Professional preparation requirements for any of the related services professions varies
somewhat. Table 1 lists the degrees required for some of these professions. Preparation includes
course work and extensive clinical practicum experience in providing services to children and
adults. Interested persons should contact the professional association(s) directly. (See listing at
end of article) That association will also have information on college and university training
programs and requirements for certification and licensure.<p>
Some special education and related services specialties have "paraprofessional" level positions
available for those individuals who want to work in a supervised capacity with children and
youth with disabilities, and/or cannot afford or make time for the comprehensive schooling
required of the certified professional. Paraprofessionals work under the supervision of the
specialist, supporting and providing selected services to the children. In some professions,
paraprofessional positions may be the first step on a career ladder, and with further education and
training may lead to full certification as a professional.<p>
<h2>Deciding on a Career </h2>
The best way to learn more about careers in special education and related services professions is
to talk to professionals already practicing in the field. You should feel free to contact special
education and related services professionals in your local school system as well as faculty at
nearby colleges and universities. Find out what they do, why they chose their professions, and
what they find challenging and rewarding about their work. The more you know about careers
focused on children and youth with disabilities, the better able you will be to make an informed
career choice. <p>
If you have never worked with an individual who has a disability, you may want to test your
interest through volunteer activities that can provide hands-on experience. Depending on your
availability and interests, you may choose to become involved in a one-time event, a short-term
project, or a long-term commitment. For example, you may choose to tutor students in the
classroom or after school. Or you may want to be a "buddy" to someone with a disability by
going out to lunch or dinner, seeing a movie, or just visiting with each other. <p><br>
Contact your local school district or special education consortium to participate in special
events and to provide volunteer services. Volunteers are often needed for play groups, individual
tutoring assistance, after school care programs, etc. The volunteer bureau for organizations in
your area may also be contacted to obtain information about organizations and agencies that offer
volunteer experiences. The National Clearinghouse for Professions in Special Education also has
lists of national organizations seeking volunteers. <p>
<h2>Careers that Make a Difference</h2>
Professionals who teach and provide services to students with disabilities have challenging yet
rewarding careers. A career in special education or one of the related services professions offers
an opportunity to work in partnership with students, parents, professional colleagues, and the
community. It is an opportunity to have a positive, lasting impact on the lives of children and
youth with special needs. <p>

DESCRIPTION.  A subdivision is a state, province, or Canada-wide unit composed of members of a specific 
international division.  The two parts of a subdivision's name consist of (a) the state, province, or Canada (if 
Canada-wide) and (b) the international division.  OH-CASE is comprises all CASE members in Ohio.  <P> 
A subdivision is responsible to both its parent division and federation (or Canadian CEC if Canada-wide).  It can 
be considered for CEC unit status only after receiving endorsement by both groups.<P> 
Subdivisions should not be referred to as "divisions" or "chapters."<P> 
Most subdivisions sponsor federation-level conference sessions; they also provide subject-specialty technical 
assistance, promote networking within their focus area, and provide a voice to enhance policy development 
across a state, province or Canada.<P> 
MEMBERSHIP.  According to CEC Delegate Assembly requirements, subdivisions must maintain unified 
membership--i.e., all CEC members who belong to the international division and whose memberships are located 
in the federation or in Canada are recognized as members of the subdivision.  Only members may vote and hold 
office.  No others are to be granted membership nor the privileges of membership.  Non-members may attend 
meetings, pay a non-member registration fee for conferences or other activities, and/or subscribe to publications 
(e.g., the newsletter), but great care must be taken to prevent the awarding or assumption of membership by 
anyone who is not a CEC and division member.<P> 
STEPS IN ORGANIZING A NEW SUBDIVISION.  Information for organizing a subdivision may be obtained 
from the Division Manager at CEC Headquarters.  The procedures are:<P> 
a.     Contact CEC Headquarters to request the requirements and procedures for official unit recognition, any 
additional requirements of the division and/or the federation, and the list of proposed subdivision members (e.g., 
division members affiliated with the federation).<BR> 
b.     Schedule a meeting to which all division members and other interested persons from the federation (or 
Canada if Canada-wide) are invited.<BR> 
c.     Ensure that there is a minimum of 15 members in the federation (or Canada if Canada- wide) to start the 
subdivision.<BR> 
d.     Appoint or elect officers and establish the committees necessary to meet the requirements established by 
CEC, the international division, and the federation.<BR> 
e.     Send the subdivision application form, the proposed constitution and bylaws, and all other attachments to 
the international division president for signature, to the federation (or Canadian CEC if Canada-wide) president 
for signature, and to CEC Headquarters to receive applicant subdivision status.<BR> 
<BR> 
REQUIREMENTS.  To function as an official subdivision of CEC, an organized group of CEC members must 
meet the following requirements which are specified in the CEC Articles of Incorporation and Constitution and 
Bylaws or have been legislated by the CEC Delegate Assembly:<P> 
a.     Maintain a minimum membership of 15 persons.<BR> 
b.     Maintain unified membership.  Subdivision members must be members of the international division and, 
thus, of The Council for Exceptional Children.<BR> 
c.     Recognize, as members of the subdivision, all CEC members who belong to the international division and 
whose memberships are located in the federation (or in Canada if it is a Canada-wide subdivision).  No others 
are to be granted membership.<BR> 
d.     Refrain from collecting subdivision membership dues, although fees for conference registration, 
publications, or for other subdivision services or activities may be charged of both members and nonmembers.  
Nonpayment of such fee(s) by a member shall <B>not</B> deprive him/her of privileges of membership, such 
as receipt of ballots and voting privileges.<BR> 
e.     Abide by all official decisions of the international division's and sponsoring federation's (or Canada's if 
Canada-wide) governing bodies as well as the CEC Delegate Assembly.<BR> 
f.     Operate under a constitution and bylaws that has been approved by CEC Headquarters (and that 
incorporates any additional requirements established by the international division and the federation) and that 
shows the name to be congruent with the name of the international division and federation (or Canada if Canada-
wide) with which it is identified.<BR> 
g.     Show in professionally appropriate ways, including on stationery and in publications, following the name of 
the subdivision:  "A Subdivision of [The Name of the Division] of The Council for Exceptional Children."<BR> 
h.     Inform CEC Headquarters of any amendments to the constitution and bylaws; CEC Headquarters will send 
a copy to the international division and to the federation.  An up-to-date copy should be on file with CEC 
Headquarters and the international division at all times.<BR> 
i.     Conduct all business transactions within the framework of provisions established by the officially adopted 
constitution and bylaws.<BR> 
j.     Select an executive body of not less than three officers.<BR> 
k.     Conduct a broad professional program in keeping with the general purposes of CEC, the international 
division, the federation (or Canadian CEC if Canada-wide), and its own special purposes.<BR> 
l.     Conduct, at regular intervals, activities that include both professional and business meetings.<BR> 
m.     Submit an annual report to CEC Headquarters, the international division, and to the federation (or 
Canadian CEC if Canada-wide).<BR> 
<BR> 
The international division and the sponsoring federation may have additional, non-conflicting requirements.<P> 
When writing/reviewing your constitution and bylaws:<P> 
*     DO make sure that you have included all of the elements required by CEC Delegate Assembly policy (listed 
above).  <B>All</B> of these elements are required for approval of your constitution.<BR> 
*     DO refer to your unit as a subdivision--not a division or chapter.<BR> 
*     DON'T provide for membership dues or membership fees.  You cannot collect money in this way, but can 
have fees for meeting or conference registration or a newsletter subscription fee.  The fees for non-members can 
be higher than for members.<BR> 
<BR> 
Be sure to provide an updated copy of your constitution to your division and federation (and CEC Headquarters 
if you are a unit of CEC) whenever you make changes to your constitution.<P> 
HOW TO OBTAIN CEC UNIT STATUS.  After your subdivision has received official recognition from both 
the international division and the sponsoring federation, you may file for CEC unit status.  The procedures 
are:<P> 
1.     Review your constitution and bylaws to ensure they meet the specified requirements.  If not, they should be 
updated.<BR> 
2.     Complete the CEC Unit Application for Subdivisions.  Send this form to your federation president (or 
Canadian CEC if Canada-wide) and international division president for signature.  If you need their addresses, 
please call us at the toll-free number.<BR> 
3.     After both signatures have been obtained, send the subdivision application form and your constitution and 
bylaws to:  Susan Simmons, Division Manager, Membership Department, The Council for Exceptional Children, 
1920 Association Drive, Reston, VA 22091-1589.<BR> 
<BR> 
CEC Headquarters staff will review your application and supporting documents, then contact you.<P> 
PRIVILEGES.  A subdivision exercises autonomy of operation within the framework of the CEC Articles of 
Incorporation and Constitution and Bylaws and the regulations adopted by the Delegate Assembly and may:<P> 
a.     Plan its own professional programs and develop its own projects.<BR> 
b.     Determine its own financial program.  A subdivision is autonomous in deciding how its income is to be 
spent.<BR> 
c.     Include in its constitution and bylaws provisions that will strengthen the subdivision.<BR> 
d.     Receive a charter upon fulfillment of the requirements.<BR> 
<BR> 
The international division and the sponsoring federation may provide additional privileges and support as 
outlined below.<P> 
CEC UNIT PRIVILEGES FOR SUBDIVISIONS.  A subdivision can be considered for CEC unit status only 
after receiving endorsement by both its parent division and federation (or Canadian CEC if Canada-wide).  
Subdivisions who are units of CEC automatically receive their quarterly membership rosters, the 
<I>Membership Bulletin</I> newsletter, and other information and materials sent throughout the year to 
units.<P> 
DIVISION SUPPORT.  Examples of practices by international divisions to advance the relationships with their 
subdivisions are:<P> 
&iuml;     Distribute a summary of the meetings of the division's board of directors to the presidents of the 
subdivisions.<BR> 
&iuml;     Request input from the subdivisions on division programs, publications, activities and services.<BR> 
&iuml;     Highlight activities of the subdivisions in the division's newsletter.<BR> 
&iuml;     Provide annual membership rebates.  It should be noted that the divisions are not required to provide 
rebates.  Those that do set the rebate amount, qualification requirements, and deadlines.<BR> 
&iuml;     Provide seed money, grants or loans for conferences, publications, or other subdivision 
activities/services.<BR> 
&iuml;     Host a meeting of the subdivision representatives at the CEC annual convention.<BR> 
&iuml;     Invite subdivision officers and members to serve as division delegates at the Delegate Assembly.<BR> 
&iuml;     Inform the subdivision presidents of the identities of the other subdivision presidents.<BR> 
&iuml;     Solicit nominations of subdivision officers for division offices.<BR> 
<BR> 
FEDERATION SUPPORT.  Examples of practices by federations to advance the relationships with their 
subdivisions are:<P> 
&iuml;     Some federations include a representative from each recognized subdivision in their governing body 
(e.g., board of directors).  Most of these representatives receive full voting privileges and are full participants on 
the board.<BR> 
&iuml;     Devote one issue each year of their newsletter to the subdivisions or regularly provide space in their 
newsletter for subdivision news.<BR> 
&iuml;     Provide seed money, grants or loans for conferences, publications, or other subdivision 
activities/services.<BR> 
&iuml;     Provide time and space at the federation's annual conference for subdivision business and membership 
meetings.<BR> 
&iuml;     Allocate session time slots to subdivisions to select sessions for the federation's annual 
conference.<BR> 
&iuml;     Co-sponsor conferences and/or conference activities (speakers, social events, etc.).<BR> 
&iuml;     Provide rebates to subdivisions for their members attending the federation's annual conference.<BR> 
<BR> 
CEC HEADQUARTERS SUPPORT.  In addition to the benefits extended to subdivisions who are units of the 
Council, subdivisions may also call upon the Division Manager and the Membership Department at CEC 
Headquarters for assistance and materials.  The Division Manager is the subdivision's contact for membership 
lists, mailing labels (3c per name plus 10% for handling and 1st class postage; minimum charge of $5.50)--useful 
for newsletter mailings and membership development activities, and CEC and division membership brochures 
and applications.  Call the CEC Membership Department toll-free at 1-800-845-6232, or FAX us at 703/264-
9494.<P> 
THE ANNUAL REPORT AND OFFICER LIST.  At the end of their term of office, the outgoing President 
should submit their annual report plus the officer list for the upcoming year.  CEC Delegate Assembly policy 
requires that all subdivisions submit an annual report to their division and federation.  Those subdivisions who 
are units of CEC must also submit their annual report and officer list to CEC Headquarters.  The forms are sent 
to unit Presidents each Spring; or call the CEC Membership Department at the toll-free number to obtain these 
forms.

In 1992, the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) was awarded a grant by the Office
of Special Education Programs (OSEP) of the U.S. Department of Education entitled A
Continuing Education Program on Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. The goal of
the 3-year grant was to enhance the knowledge and skills of special and general
educators to better serve children with attention deficits. Four training modules were
developed that drew from CEC's Task Force on Attention Deficit Disorder,  the
synthesis efforts of the federally funded research centers, and other field research and
practice-based initiatives. <P>

Since the project's inception, the training content was developed, revised, and delivered
by leaders in the four module topic areas. A variety of professional development
activities were conducted over the course of the project, including full-day workshops,
conference sessions, and conference strands. Content was revised and updated based
on evaluations by workshop participants and developments in the knowledge base.  
Descriptions of the modules follow. <P>

<ul><li><b>Module I:  Characteristics and Identification</b><br>
<font size=2><i>Ron E. Reeve, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Education<br> and Director, Curry
Programs in Clinical and School Psychology, University of Virginia <br>
James V. Wright, Ed.D., Associate Professor, Department Head, Counselor,
Leadership and Special Education, Auburn University at Montgomery</i></font><P>

This module provides a brief historical background of ADHD, followed by a clinical
description of children with the disorder. Current definitions of ADHD are also
presented. A model for the assessment process is offered, which takes into account
emerging "best practice." Information is presented regarding the important cultural and
ethnic issues that must be considered in the assessment and intervention process.
</ul> <P>

<ul><LI><B>Module II:  Model School Programs</b><BR>
<font size=2><i>Mary Spessard, Director, Curriculum and Instruction, <br>Coloma Community Schools,
Coloma,    Michigan</i></font><P>

The second module addresses the issue of school reform and its impact on service
delivery to children with ADHD. This module explores the rationale for a collaborative
teaching approach between general and special educators and important features of
this approach. Specific components necessary for success are included.  Attention is
given to ways of structuring classrooms that will honor diversity a theme introduced in
module I while maintaining high expectations.</ul><P>

<ul><li><b>Module III:  Effective Classroom Interventions</b><br>
<font size=2><i>Ron Walker, M.A., Educational Consultant, Walker Educational Consulting, Inc.,
Gainesville,         Georgia<br>
Ann B. Welch, M.A., M.Ed., Educational Consultant and Resource Teacher, Virginia
L. Murray      Elementary School, Albemarle County Public Schools, Charlottesville,
Virginia</i></font> <P>

This module focuses on specific classroom practices.  Modules II and III take the
position that, in many cases, administrative, instructional, and management changes
beneficial for students with ADHD are beneficial for everyone. When a teacher adds to
his or her repertoire of skills to meet the needs of students with ADHD, those new skills
can be used to benefit all students. </ul><P>

<ul><li><b>Module IV:  Policy and Administrative Issues</b><br>
<font size=2><i>Ron Reeve, Associate Professor of Education<br> and Director, Curry Programs in
Clinical and      School Psychology, University of Virginia<br>
Judy Schrag, Ph.D., V. President, VSA Educational Services, Learning Systems
Group,     Washington, DC<br>
Ron Walker, M.A., Educational Consultant, Walker Educational Consulting, Inc.,
Gainesville,    Georgia</i></font><P>

Module IV covers the legal, administrative, and policy issues that are critical in
designing and implementing appropriate programs for students with ADHD.  The legal
requirements for schools under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (504), and the Americans with Disabilities
Act of 1990 (ADA) are explained and compared.</ul><P>

A video and manual were developed for use together.  Following each module in the
manual, questions are presented that correspond to the content in the video and
manual. These questions can be used to guide and facilitate discussion in a workshop
format.<P>

Since 1975, special education law has required the states to have a comprehensive system of
personnel development (CSPD).   Each state must develop a system to ensure that personnel
involved in special education are adequately prepared and receive continuing education.  This
helps teachers by ensuring that they are trained to do their work and guards against serious
personnel shortages. <P>

The goals of the National Institute of Comprehensive System of Personnel Development
(CSPD) are to provide the training and support to leaders of State Education Agencies
(SEAs), Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs), and Local Education Agencies (LEAs) and
other significant stakeholders who are collaborating to establish and organize the state's
special education CSPD as an effective vehicle for change.<P>

Since 1990 the National Institute for CSPD Collaboration has had the opportunity to work with
over 40 states and territories in developing a CSPD strategic plan. Through our involvement
with these teams, we have consistently noticed that the core of a successful state CSPD is a
dynamic state-level stakeholder leadership CSPD committee   one that effectively
determines the needs of personnel and meets those needs through strategic planning.<P>

Since PL 94-142 was enacted, the components of a CSPD have been viewed as separate
pieces (i.e., preservice, evaluation, needs assessment, collaboration, dissemination, technical
assistance, and continuing education).  Even though these elements are the foundation for
developing a CSPD, states frequently do not integrate the parts into a working whole that
creates a comprehensive system. With the addition of CSPD regulations for Part H and
vocational rehabilitation, states now have the opportunity to create a CSPD that successfully
addresses training issues from birth through adulthood.<P>

To accurately assess personnel development needs throughout the state, some states are
moving toward regionalizing their CSPD. Regional CSPD teams, based on the regional
configuration of any given state, are modeled after the state committee. Each region may have
representation on the state CSPD committee. Each region will develop a strategic plan based
on the needs of the region. Each region will submit its strategic plan to the state committee
which will become the basis for assessing the state professional development needs. In some
cases the state will have a level of funding to assist the region in implementing its plan. The
regional needs, plus the state agencies' needs, will form the basis for the state CSPD plan,
which will become part of the state plan.<P>

A statewide CSPD strategic plan is a vehicle that will allow local and statewide professional
development efforts to become a continuous process of change. A coordinated, focused
CSPD committee that embraces leadership and change through statewide professional
development activities is the backbone of systemic change.<P>

The National Training Program for Gifted Education at The Council for Exceptional Children is
funded under the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program, U.S.
Department of Education.  This 3-year project has provided continuing education opportunities
for teachers, administrators, and other professionals who are involved in the education of gifted
and talented students.  Specific goals included:

<ul><li>Advancing the education of gifted students by providing research-based, state-of-the art
training and materials that increase the capability of school systems and personnel to identify
and provide educational services to this population.<P>

<li>Advancing the education of all students by making the pedagogy of gifted education more
accessible to professionals in the broader education community.<P>

<li>Extending the options available to trainers in gifted education in state, regional, and local
educational agencies, and in other institutions by providing an organized base of training
materials and informational products for use in new or established training programs.</ul><P>

<b>PROJECT ACTIVITIES AND FOCUS</b><P>

The <i>National Training Program</i> used the following formats for the delivery of training
activities to diverse audiences:

<ul><li><i>Leadership symposia</i> convened leaders in the field of gifted education to
examine policy and practice in the field and interact with colleagues in general education,
government, and business.<p>

<li><i> Institute Trainings </i>provided in-depth continuing education for teachers, teacher
educators, administrators, supervisors, and other personnel involved in preservice and inservice
education.<p>

<li>A <i>Video-based</i> continuing education series extended opportunities to an audience of
practitioners nationwide.</ul><P>

CEC has developed related informational and training materials for dissemination to the
professional education community nationwide. <P>

<B>Guidelines for publishing in <I>Exceptional Children</b></I>
(approximately 4 printed pages)<br>
Journal of The Council for Exceptional Children<p>
<b>Purpose of <I>Exceptional Children</I></b>
<I>Exceptional Children</I> is the research journal of The Council for Exceptional
Children. It
presents research and analyses on:<br>
<ul> <li>Education and development of exceptional infants,
toddlers, children, and youth. <br>
<li>Professional issues and policies relevant to exceptional
infants, toddlers, children, and youth.</UL><p>
 All research that is published in <I>Exceptional Children</I>
should have implications for practice, and these must be stated in the article.
Manuscripts
that focus on practical methods and materials for classroom use should be submitted to
<I>TEACHING Exceptional Children,</I> the CEC journal that is specifically for
teachers of children
with disabilities and children who are gifted. <P><I>Exceptional Children</I> does
not accept poetry,
accounts of personal experiences, or nondatabased reports on innovative techniques,
programs, or models. Surveys of opinions, correlational studies of assessment
instruments,
and outdated studies are rarely accepted. <P>
<b>Writing for <I>Exceptional Children</I></b><P>
 While <I>Exceptional Children</I> is the research journal, its articles are read by a
much broader
audience, than just researchers. Therefore, articles written for <I>Exceptional
Children</I> need
to be written for this broader audience. Articles should not be viewed as shortened
versions
of dissertation or technical reports, but rather as a way to inform other researchers,
school
administrators, state department personnel, service providers, teachers, parents, and
others
about your research and its implications for practice. Articles must be clear and concise.
To best meet the needs of the broader audience, consider the following questions as you
prepare your manuscript: <P>
<I>Introduction</I><P>
<ul> <li>Why is your research needed?<br>
<li>What are 2 to 3 key points the reader needs to
understand before reading about what you did?<br>
<LI>Is the tone positive?<br>
<li>Have you
successfully communicated in less than 5 pages, and ideally in 2 to 3 pages?
</UL><P>
<I>Methodology</I><br>
<ul> <LI>Have you provided enough general information in a way that a lay
reader can
understand what you have done?
<LI>Have you provided a source of further information
about methodology for the researcher who wants to replicate your research?
</UL><P>
<I>Results</I><br>
<ul> <LI>Have you organized your results in a way that promotes the
understanding of your
findings?      <LI>Have you provided the necessary details for the researcher without
making
it difficult for others to read? </UL><p>
<I>Discussion</I><br>
<ul><LI> What are the 2 to 3 key points that need to be made about your
findings?   <LI>What
limitations are there on your research and its findings?    <LI>What are the practical
implications of your findings?     <LI>What are the next steps to be taken? <P>
<B>Manuscript Requirements</b></UL><p>
 Manuscripts sent to <I>Exceptional Children</I> are submitted to a review process
only if they
meet the following criteria:  <ul> <LI>Content is original, not previously
published (in whole
or in part), and not under consideration elsewhere.    <LI>Format conforms to the
standards
in the <L>Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association</L> (4th
edition, 1994),
with two exceptions:     (1)  footnotes should not be used  (2)  reproductions
of figures (rather than professionally prepared figures) may be sent for the review
process.
<LI>Language conforms to the recommendations outlined in Guidelines for Reporting
and
Writing About People with Disabilities (Research and Training Center on Independent
Living, 4th edition, 1995). 
<LI>Four copies are submitted, with authors identified only
on the title page, along with a cover letter stating that the manuscript is original work,
not
previously published, and not under consideration elsewhere.
<LI>While under review
(until the author receives word of a decision from <I>Exceptional Children</I>), the
journal has
exclusive options on possible publication. The manuscript should not be submitted
elsewhere.</UL><P> 
<B>Review Process</B><P>
Selection of manuscripts for publication is based on a blind peer review process.
However,
all manuscripts are screened first. Those manuscripts that do not meet the manuscript
requirements, or that are not consistent with the purpose of the journal, are not
forwarded
for peer review. The author either is notified that the manuscript is not acceptable for
<I>Exceptional Children</I>, or is requested to make changes in the manuscript so
that it meets
requirements. Copies of the manuscript are not returned to the author in either
case.<P>
Manuscripts that are not screened out and that are consistent with the purpose of the
journal are sent out for peer review. Reviewers will not know the identity of the
author.<P>
Manuscripts are evaluated by reviewers on several criteria. The field editor evaluation
form
that is used is shown on page 4. <p>Based on the blind reviews, the Associate editors
and/or
co-editors will communicate the results of that review to the author. The decision that is
communicated to the author will be one of the following:    <P>
<UL><LI> Acceptable, with routine
editing   <LI>Acceptable, with revisions indicated by editor   
<LI>Unacceptable</UL><P>
When a decision
is made that a manuscript is unacceptable for <I>Exceptional Children</I>, it may
be
recommended that it be sent to a journal of one of the CEC Divisions. This
recommendation
does not mean that the manuscript would be automatically accepted by a Division
journal;
the manuscript would have to go through the review process again. The following are
the
CEC Division periodicals and the focus of each:        <P>

<b><i>Articles</b></i><p>

<ul>
<li> <i>School-To-Work Components That Predict Postschool Success for Students with and Without
Disabilities</i><br>
Michael R. Benz, Paul Yovanoff, and Bonnie Doren<br>
Student and parents interviews for students with and without disabilities provided general 
support for the school-based and work-based instructional components envisioned as part of 
comprehensive school-to-work programs.<p>

<li><i>Strategy Instruction in Planning: Effects on the Writing Performance and Behavior of Students with Learning Difficulties</i><br>
Susan De La Paz and Steve Graham<br> 
Following instruction on a retrieve and write strategy, students wrote essays that were longer, provided more support for their premise, and were qualitatively better.<p>

<li><i>Importance of Social Support in the Adjustment of Children with Learning Problems</I><br>
Melodie Wenz-Gross and Gary N. Siperstein<br>
Although 4th through 6th grade children with and without learning problems did not differ on the size or composition of their social networks, or on the negative features of friendships, children with learning problems used their network differently for support.<p>

<li><i>Collaborative Problem-Solving to Promote the Inclusion of Young Children with Significant  Disabilities in Primary Grades</I><br>
Christine L. Salisbury, Ian M. Evans, and Mary M. Palombaro<br>
A collaborative problem solving process was found to be implemented appropriately and to be viewed positively by teachers, as well as to promote outcomes valued by district stakeholders.<p>

<li><i>Family Perspectives on Inclusive Lifestyle Issues for People with Problem Behavior</I>Ann P. Turnbull and Mike Ruef<br>
Interviews with families of children, youth, and adults with problem behavior suggest extremely scant and tenuous inclusive life-style supports for these individuals and their families.<p>

<li><i>Promoting Interactions Among Preschoolers with and Without Disabilities: Effects of a Buddy Skills-Training Program</I><br>
Kris English, Howard Goldstein, Karin Shafer and Louise Kaczmarek<br>
Increases in interactions among preschoolers with and without disabilities following training support the benefits of peer training for promoting peer interactions, considered a prerequisite for the development of friendships in integrated preschools.<p>

<li><i>Self-Determination and Positive Adult Outcomes: A Follow-Up Study of Youth with Mental Retardation or Learning Disabilities</i><br>
Michael Wehmeyer and Michelle Schwartz<br>
Students who have high self-determination ratings before leaving high school were found to have achieved several more positive adult outcomes than their peers who lower self determination ratings.<p>

<li><i>Styles of Thinking, Abilities, and Academic Performance</i><br>
Elena Grigorenko and Robert J. Sternberg<br>
Thinking styles were found to play a significant role in the academic performance of gifted students, with equally able thinkers of different styles performing better in different assessment settings.<p>

<li><i>Characteristics and Practices of Sign Language Interpreters in Inclusive Education Programs</i><br>
Bernhardt E. Jones, Gary M. Clark, and Donald F. Soltz<br>
Information on educational sign language interpreters in the K-12 public school system raises several questions about the dependence of students who are deaf or hard of hearing on the educational interpreter support system.<p>

<li><i>Becoming Architects of Communities of Learning: Addressing Academic Diversity in Contemporary Classrooms</i><br>
Carol Ann Tomlinson, Carolyn M. Callahan, Ellen M. Tomchin, Nancy Eiss, Marcia Imbeau and Mary Landrum<br>
The preservice experiences of novice teachers suggest several guidelines for expanding the acceptance of diversity and differentiating instruction for academically diverse learners.</ul>

<B>Guidelines for Publishing in <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children</b></I><br>
(approximately 5 printed pages)<br>
August 1996<br>
Journal of The Council for Exceptional Children<p>

<I>TEACHING Exceptional Children (TEC),</I> published six times per year, is a
journal designed specifically for teachers, administrators, and other practitioners who
work with children and youth with disabilities or who are gifted.  As the largest special
education practitioner journal, <I>TEC</I> is received by all members of The
Council for Exceptional Children thereby reaching over 60,000 individuals,
organizations, and libraries around the world. <p>The following information is
designed
to assist authors in preparing materials to
submit to <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children.</I>  This document replaces all
earlier versions.<p><B>Is <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children</I> an
appropriate
journal for
publishing my work? </B><P>
The purpose of <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children</I>  is to advance the
professional
development of the personnel in the
field and provide practical information, resources, and tools for improving the education
and services for children and youth
with disabilities or who are gifted.<P>
Consistent with our purpose, we seek to publish articles that deal with practical
methods and materials for use in a wide
variety of educational settings.<p>
<I>TEC</I> has an open submissions policy and seeks manuscripts from the field on
a
wide variety of practical issues
confronting special education teachers and administrators.  We encourage submissions
that include multiple authors
representing the diversity of professional roles within the field.  <p>
We seek to publish original work that describes:  action research; research with an
applied focus; specific instructional
and management interventions; works that help us understand under-represented
points of view (i.e., children, youth,
families) concerning exceptionality, schooling, or special education;  issues in reform of
service delivery, curriculum, and
roles; strategies for fostering professional development; information pertaining to state
and federal legislation, rules, and
regulations; and issues related to the effectiveness of special education or specific
practices.  Manuscripts on these and similar
topics will be accepted at any time.<p>
<I>TEC </I>will also consider the following types of
manuscripts:<p><b><I>Letters to
the Editor</B></I><p>
Letters to the editor may involve reaction to material appearing in <I>TEC</I> or an
issue in
the field of special education.  Letters are limited to two double-spaced typed pages
with no tables,
figures, footnotes, or references.    Letters are subject to editing and condensation by
the editorial
staff.<P>
<B><I>Product Reviews</B></I><P>
Individuals interested in submitting reviews of books or media should first contact the
editor to
determine <I>TEC's</I> interest and whether a review is already in preparation. 
Evidence of
the reviewer's expertise in the area will be requested.  Reviews are typically limited to
2-4 pages
(including cover page).<P>
<B><I>Topical Series</b></I><P>
Topical Series are composed of 4-6 feature articles by different authors relating to a
single topic.  A topical series is
conceptualized and coordinated by an author with extensive experience and expertise
in the area.  Authors who wish to
assemble a topical series of articles should first contact the Editor to determine
<I>TEC's</I> interest in the specific topic
and whether a similar topic is already in preparation.<P>
Authors are encouraged to be mindful that the purpose of a professional journal is not
to publish all manuscripts having
merit but to select those having the greatest merit given the aims and scope of the
journal within the limitations of available
space.  If you have any questions about the appropriateness of <I>TEACHING
Exceptional Children</I> for publishing
your work, please contact our editorial offices (1-414-229-5260).<p><B>What should
I
know about <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children</I> before I
prepare my manuscript?</b><P>
Authors are encouraged to consider the following guidelines relative to style, format,
length, and person-first language in the
development of a manuscript for <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children.</I><P>
<B><I>Style</B></I><P>
The hallmark of manuscripts accepted for publication in <I>TEACHING Exceptional
Children</I> is their focus on the practical application of knowledge.  We encourage
authors to
avoid jargon and "academic-prose" in favor of a style of writing that engages the reader. 
As
suggested by the literature on improving practice with research, we seek articles that
impact how
teachers think about their work and  provide teachers with tools for improving their
practices.<P>
We seek manuscripts that have a central message and strongly encourage the use of
sidebars or
gray boxes that contain valuable supplementary information (i.e., frameworks,
guidelines, readings
for further study, profiles of the participants, quotes or viewpoints of individuals with a
major stake
in the intervention described).  The editorial staff views these design elements as
essential for three
reasons. <p>
<ol><li>Gray boxes and sidebars allow authors to feature quotes, viewpoints,
or
profiles of individuals from groups that have been under-represented in the literature. 
We are
particularly interested in increasing the number of voices in <I>TEC</I> to reflect
the
diversity
of the children and youth we serve as well as the diversity of professional roles that
provide
services. <p>
<li>Research on adoption of innovation indicates that individuals are at a variety of
levels in
their interest and understanding of an innovation.  As a result, we want to encourage
authors to
recognize this continuum of knowledge and skill and use gray boxes and sidebars to
provide
information that will enable self-directed readers to advance their knowledge and skill
about the
topic whether they are a novice or already fairly well-informed about  the topic. <p>
<li>These tools are essential in preparing visually interesting layouts in the journal.
</ol><p><B><I>Format</b></I><P>
<ol><li>Manuscripts should be well-organized and concise.  They should be
written
in a direct, clear, and
reasonable style.<p>
<LI>All material must be double- spaced, including quotations and references. 
<I>TEC</I> requires that all
manuscripts be double-spaced with 10- or 12-point text in an appropriate font and
one-inch margins. <p>
<LI>Preferred positions of tables and figures should be indicated in the
manuscript.<p>
<LI>For rules governing references and general format, consult:<I> The Publication
Manual of the American
Psychological Association</I> (4th ed., The American Psychological Association,
1994).  In
case of questions concerning style
considerations, authors are encouraged to depart from APA in favor of the
<I>TEC</I>
style guidelines noted above.<p><B><L>Length</b></l><P>
Manuscripts submitted for publication in <I>TEC</I> are usually of two lengths:
<ul><LI>4 double-spaced pages for a one-page feature.  An additional page is
allowed for the cover page as well as the abstract.<p>
<LI>12 double-spaced pages for a feature article.   Indicates total manuscript length,
including the cover page, abstract,
figures, and references. </UL><p>All material must be double-spaced, including
quotations and references.<P>
<B><I>Person-First Language</B></I><P>
Authors are encouraged to write using "person-first" language:  the person precedes
the disability, both figuratively and
literally.  This standard will result in terms such as "people with disabilities" rather than
"the
disabled."<P>
<B>What should I know about submitting my manuscript to <I>TEACHING
Exceptional Children?</b></I><P>
Manuscripts will be accepted for review provided:<P>
<ol><LI>The cover letter indicates that the manuscript has not been published
in
whole or substantial part by
another publisher.<p>
<LI>The manuscript is not being considered concurrently in whole or substantial part
by
another publisher.<p>
<LI>The journal has exclusive option on possible publication for a period of 6 months
following receipt of the
manuscript.<p>
<LI>The author assumes responsibility for publication clearance in the event the
manuscript was presented at a
professional meeting or is the direct product of a project financed by a funding
agency.<p>
<LI>Authors are responsible for the authenticity of all quoted material and
bibliographic
citations from the original
source for quotes in excess of 150 words or for tables or figures reproduced from
published works.<p><LI>The Council for Exceptional Children and the Editor
assume
no responsibility for statements or opinions expressed
by contributors in articles published in <I>TEACHING Exceptional
Children.</I><p><LI>The Council for Exceptional Children retains literary
property rights
on copyrighted articles. Up to 100 copies of
the articles in <I>TEC</I> may be reproduced for nonprofit distribution without
permission from the publisher. All other
forms of reproduction require permission from the
publisher.</OL><p><B><I>Manuscript Submission Checklist</B></I><P>
Prior to mailing your manuscript to <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children,</I> review
the
following checklist.  Have you: <P>
<UL><LI>Prepared a cover letter?<p>
--Authors must provide assurances that  the  manuscript is an original work that has not
been previously published and that
the manuscript is not being considered concurrently in whole or substantial part by
another publisher.<p>
--Include the name, address, phone number, fax number, and E-mail address (if
available) of each author.<p>
<LI>Included a title page?<p>
--The title page should include the manuscript title,  author(s) names, title, affiliation,
and running head. <p>
<LI>Included an abstract?<p>
--The first page of the manuscript should repeat the title of the manuscript and include
an abstract of no more than 150
words.  The name(s) of the author(s) should not appear on this or any subsequent page
of text.<p>
<LI>Included a disk?<p>
--Label the disk with the computer format (IBM/compatible or Macintosh [high density
only]).<p>
--Indicate the name and version of the program (i.e., WordPerfect 6.1) used to create
the file(s).<p>
--Include on the disk files that contain the manuscript, tables, references, and
figures.<p><LI>Assembled four copies of the complete  manuscript?<P>
--Be sure to retain a copy of the manuscript for your files.<p>If all of these items check
out, mail the materials to:  Dave L. Edyburn, Editor, <I>TEACHING Exceptional
Children,</I>
Department of Exceptional Education, 667 Enderis Hall, University of Wisconsin-
Milwaukee, 2400 E. Hartford Ave.,
Milwaukee, WI  53201-0413.</UL><p><B>What happens to a manuscript once it
is
received
in the <I>TEC</I>
offices?</b><P>
When a manuscript is delivered to the <I>TEC</I> offices, the editor reviews the
manuscript and decides whether or not
to accept the manuscript for peer review.  Some of the reasons a manuscript may
not be accepted for review involve
(a) the focus of the manuscript is outside the focus of the journal; (b) failure to follow
the
manuscript guidelines concerning
length, format, and style; or (c) articles on this topic were published within the past 2
years or are slated for publication in
the near future.  Manuscripts that are not accepted for peer review will be promptly
returned so that the author can
seek other avenues for publication.<P>
Each manuscript accepted for peer review is assigned a unique identification number
that is used for tracking the
manuscript through the review and publication process.  The receipt of each manuscript
accepted for peer review is
acknowledged in a letter with the manuscript ID number and detailed information about
the expected timelines for the peer
review.  Authors are encouraged to contact the editorial offices any time during the
review process regarding questions about
the status of their manuscript. <p><B>What should I know about the peer review
process used by <I>TEACHING
Exceptional Children?</I></B><P>
Manuscripts submitted to <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children</I> go through a
blind
review process (that is, the author's
identity is unknown to the reader) for selection.  Typically, four reviewers, with
expertise
in the areas addressed by the
manuscript,   will evaluate the manuscript on the basis of (a) the importance of the
topic, (b) originality, (c) clarity, (d)
accuracy and validity of the content, (e) value of the contribution to the professional
literature, (f) implications for special
education, and (g) quality of the writing.  Each reviewer  will  make a recommendation
for or against publication.  Typically,
this process takes 4-6 weeks.<P>
<B>What happens after a manuscript is reviewed by the peer reviewers?</b><P>
The recommendations of the reviewers are forwarded to the editor.  After reviewing
these recommendations, the editor will
make a decision concerning the manuscript:  (a) decline the opportunity to publish, (b)
request a revision with a stipulation
for further peer review, (c) request a revision subject to additional review by 
<I>TEC</I> staff, or (d) accept as is. <P>
The editorial decision and rationale will be communicated in a letter to the first author. 
Copies of the peer reviews will
be included as well. <p>
Like most journals, almost all manuscripts submitted to <I>TEC</I> involve some
level
of additional revision (b or
c) prior to publication.<p>
<I>Grievance Procedure: </I>Authors who believe that their manuscript was not
reviewed
in a careful or timely manner
and in accordance with The Council for Exceptional Children's procedures should bring
the matter to the attention of the <a href="mailto:fredw@cec.sped.org">
Senior Director of Publications</A>.<p><B>What happens if
a
manuscript is tentatively accepted for publication?</b><P>
If a manuscript receives a favorable review from reviewers and the editor concurs with
the decision, a tentative
recommendation for publication is made.  This recommendation is conditional upon
specific revisions that must be made
as well as the submission of supporting materials (described below).  The information in
this section describes the process
and timelines related to revisions, technical editing, production, and publication.
<p><B><I>Revisions</b></I><P>
Final decision to publish a manuscript is made after the satisfactory completion of
revisions as outlined in the
correspondence.<P>
When a manuscript is accepted for publication, author(s) will be requested to provide a
final-version electronic copy of
their manuscript, tables, references, and all figures (camera-ready copies of tables and
figures may be requested prior to
publication).<p><B><I>Technical Editing</B></I><P>
The editorial staff of <I>TEC</I> reserves the right to make editorial changes that do
not materially affect the meaning
of the text.<P>
<B><I>Production</B></I><P>
To protect the works of authors and The Council for Exceptional Children, CEC
copyrights all of its publications.  Once a
manuscript is scheduled for publication, the authors are notified in writing and sent a
Copyright Release Agreement Form
assigning literary rights to CEC.  Rights and permissions regarding the use of
CEC-copyrighted materials are handled by the
CEC Publications Unit. <P>
Authors who wish to use material, such as figures or tables, for which they do not own
the copyright must obtain written
permission from the copyright holder (usually the publisher) and submit it to CEC with
their manuscripts.  Signed releases
must also be submitted from all individuals appearing in photos submitted for
publication.<p><I>TEC</I> publishes photographs/slides with many of its articles.
To
obtain photo guidelines and release forms contact the
<a
href="mailto:cathym@cec.sped.org">Manager of Periodicals Production</a>.<P>
Accepted manuscripts are copyedited and manuscripts are typeset into page proofs. 
Authors are asked to read proofs
for errors in typesetting and other defects. 
<p><B><I>Publication</B></I><P>
Upon publication of a manuscript in <I>TEC</I>, the author(s) receive five copies of
the
journal.  In the case of multiple
authors, the first author receives 10 copies to distribute among the authors.<P>

<b>Instructional Classroom Management<br>
A Proactive Approach to Behavior Management<br></b>
Edward J. Kameenui and Craig B. Darch<p>
The primary difference between an instructional approach to classroom management and all other approaches is that before an action or problem occurs, the teacher, carefully and strategically, teaches all that is required so that students will have the information necessary to behave appropriately. The authors offer a 180-day plan or curriculum for teaching appropriate behavior. Teachers will learn how to use effective teaching procedures in social and behavior skills instruction.<p>

<STRONG>
<A NAME="house">In the House. </A></STRONG> Representative Bill Goodling (R-PA), Chairman of the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, and Rep. Frank Riggs (R-CA) have indicated that working on the reauthorization of IDEA will be one of their first priorities once the 105th Congress reports to work early next year.  Congressman Riggs is expected to assume the chairmanship of the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families.  According to Riggs' office, he traded positions with Rep. Randy "Duke" Cunningham (R-CA), who was chair of the subcommittee in the 104th Congress.  Cunningham will now serve on our appropriations subcommittee (Labor, HHS, and Education). The switch will not be official, however, until Congress officially votes on it early next year.<P>

It is not known whether the new Congress will simply pick up where the 104th left off in the reauthorization process, or whether completely new bills will be introduced. Since the House passed its version of the bill last year, it's possible that it will attempt to pass an identical or very similar bill.  If that occurs, the pressure would be placed back in the Senate, where its reauthorization bill never came up for a vote in the last Congress.<P>

Rep. Riggs' office said the subcommittee tentatively plans to introduce a House bill to reauthorize IDEA on January 7, which is the first day of the 105th Congress. In addition, two hearings are tentatively scheduled to obtain input on several issues, including discipline, disruption, and cessation of services for students with disabilities.  No provisions concerning cessation of educational services for students with disabilities who violate school rules on weapons and drugs are planned to be included in the initial legislative language.  Riggs' office did not say whether a separate bill will contain these provisions. A full committee mark-up has been planned during the second week of March, 1997.<P>

We've included, for your information, the members of the <STRONG>House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities</STRONG> (25 Republicans, 20 Democrats; new members are listed in italics).<P>

  CEC has heard that the Senate will no longer have a Subcommittee on Disability Policy. This subcommittee has long had jurisdiction over such pieces of legislation as the Rehabilitation Act and the IDEA.  This means that, when IDEA reauthorization is taken up in the Senate, the full Committee on Labor and Human Resources will be initially responsible for working on the bill.  This would decrease the number of hurdles for the bill to clear and would increase the number of members who will be working on this bill early next year.  Following is a list of Senators who sit on the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources.  If your senator is on this list and you have not yet developed a relationship with his or her staff member responsible for education issues, CEC recommends that you to make an initial contact as soon as possible.  If you do have a relationship, it's not too late to send a holiday greeting card!<P>

<CENTER><H3><B>IDEA Reauthorization Process Has Ended for the 104th Congress
</H3><BR></B> </center>


Reston, VA -- All further consideration of the reauthorization of IDEA has now come to
an end for this Congress.  A formal statement to that effect has been issued by Sen.
William Frist (R-Tenn.), chair of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy,
dated September 30, 1996 (see below). <P>

CEC appreciates the Congress declining to take final action on this complex
reauthorization, given the fact that insufficient time remained for a careful and thorough
preparation of a final House/Senate bill.  CEC observes that as far back as July 4, all
parties concurred that time had even then nearly run out, since it was estimated that a
minimum of six weeks was needed to resolve differences between the two bills in a
House/Senate conference. <P>

For their leadership throughout the reauthorization process, CEC wishes to express
deep gratitude to both the House and Senate chairs and ranking members, in the
Senate most especially Sen. Frist, Sen. Tom Harkin, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, Sen. Ted
Kennedy, and the majority leader, Sen. Trent Lott; in the House, Rep. Randy
Cunningham, Rep. William Goodling, and Rep. Dale Kildee.  Further, many other
members in both Chambers made significant positive contributions to whom we will
express our thanks. Also, CEC expresses its sincere thanks to key staff, both majority
and minority, on both sides of the Hill for their tireless efforts in a most difficult
reauthorization process.  Our best way of thanking you will be our determination to pitch
in and assist you in the 105th Congress. <P>

CEC's Department of Public Policy<P>

<hr>

Following is Senator Frist's statement:<P>

<H3>IDEA REAUTHORIZATION DIES AS CONGRESS ADJOURNS FOR YEAR</h3>

WASHINGTON, DC -- For the last year-and-a-half, I have worked closely with
Congressional Republicans and Democrats, as well as disability organizations and
education groups, to create a comprehensive reauthorization of the 21-year-old
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  What emerged was a compromise
bill that took a giant leap forward in easing educators' bureaucratic nightmares and
financial burdens while preserving the right to a free, appropriate public education for
our children with disabilities.  In striking such a delicate balance, this compromise would
have ensured that our children with disabilities' needs would be met and that our
educators could do what they do best -- teach our children and expand their
horizons.<P>
     
But as time began to run out for the 104th Congress, there were some obstacles that
we just could not overcome. While I am disappointed that we couldn't bring IDEA to the
Senate floor before the close of the session, I hope that the common-sense changes in
the IDEA Amendments of 1996 will serve as a foundation for future efforts.<P>

Activities section from which you can find the IDEA HOME PAGE. <P>
     
Thank you.<P>

<CENTER><H3><b>Great News!!! IDEA Programs Receive Large Increase in FY
1997! </H3><BR></B> </center>


Reston, VA -- Late last month, Congress added almost $800 million to IDEA programs
under an omnibus appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997, which started on October 1. 
In total, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS), and Education
will receive about $71 billion under the legislation, an increase of almost $8 billion over
the FY 1996 levels.  The omnibus bill would finance nine Cabinet-level departments,
including Commerce, Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Labor, Interior,
Justice, State and Treasury, averting the possibility of another government shut down. 
The additional funding has been offset by auctioning off broadcast frequency bands
and dipping into a recapitalized insurance fund for savings and loans and other financial
institutions.<P>

IDEA programs will receive more than $4 billion in funds under the omnibus bill, an
increase of $791 million over FY 1996 levels. Following are the funding figures under
H.R. 4278 (in millions):<P>

<CENTER><H3><B>SENATE SET TO VOTE ON IDEA</H3><BR></B> </center>


Reston, VA<P>


Amendments to IDEA may be passed by the Senate this week by unanimous consent
(without debate or a formal vote).  Over the weekend, a package of amendments was
put together in response to House and Senate members.  This package is based upon
the Senate bill, but also takes language from the House bill.  Once the Senate passed a
bill with the new amendments included, the House could pass the same bill without any
further amendments.  The amendments would change the Senate bill's provisions
on:<P>

<ul><li>records transmission
<li> limits on attorney's fees
<li> initial mediation without attorneys
<li> evaluation
<li> IEP contents
<li> membership of IEP team
<li> review and revision of IEPs
<li>"seriously disruptive" children
<li> discipline
<li> notice of intent to file due process
<li> data collection</ul><P>

There is too little time for children, family, and education experts to analyze the revised
bill.  There is far too little time for Congresspersons and/or their staff to fully come to
understand the bill in order to make an educated vote.   <P>

Many members of Congress have demonstrated excellent leadership in developing the
House and Senate bills.  It would be a terrible shame for all of their careful work and
effort to result in a law developed by a quick cut-and-paste process, rather than the
normal procedure of a thoughtful, line-by-line analysis and conference agreement. <P>

We are optimistic that members of Congress who care about the interests of children
and education will NOT support passage of this bill.  We would rather work another year
for a strong bill than to pass a bill that has not had the benefit of careful scrutiny by
administrators, teachers, or parents.<P>

Our most recent information is that the bill may get Senate action late this afternoon
(Tuesday) or early Wednesday morning.  If this occurs, look for House action between
Wednesday afternoon and Friday.  Your Senators can be reached by calling
800-962-3524 or 202-224-3121, and your Representatives can be reached at
800-972-3524.<P>

<b>ACTION NEEDED</b>: Urge your Senators and Representative  to oppose any
further action on the reauthorization of IDEA in this Congress. <P>

<CENTER><H3><B>TWO AMENDMENTS TO INTERIOR <br>WOULD RESTORE EDUCATION FUNDING</H3><BR></B> </center>



Two amendments to the Interior appropriations bill would add back $2.3 billion to
education programs, including IDEA, that Republicans had cut from these programs
earlier in the year.  This restoration would match President Clinton's proposed spending
for schools.  <p>

The first amendment, offered by Senators Trent Lott (R-MS) and Arlen Specter (R-PA),
would add $752 million to IDEA/Part B, $110 million for Vocational and Adult Education,
but nothing for either the Javits Gifted and Talented Program or Goals 2000 (President
Clinton had requested that the Javits program be appropriated $10 million, up from its
current $3 million).  This amendment was agreed to by the conferees on the Interior bill.<P>

The second amendment, which Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) would like to offer, contains
a restoration of $2.327 billion to education programs.  While this amendment would add
$289 million to IDEA/Part B, it also would add $136 to Goals 2000, $78 million to
Vocational and Adult Education Programs, and $9 million to other programs, including
the Javits Gifted and Talented Program.  While this amendment has not yet been
offered, the Democrats do want an opportunity to have it considered by the conferees.<P>

While both amendments would restore much needed funding to a variety of education
programs, neither will mean anything unless the Interior bill is passed.  Its passage is
currently threatened by some issues involving immigration.  <P>

CEC supports any amendment that would increase funding for education programs,
including IDEA.  However, we would hope that any final amendment would include
increased funding for the Javits program.<P>

<b>ACTION</b>:  We need to thank Senators Specter, Lott, and Harkin, for their efforts
to increase funding for education.  Please let them know how grateful we are for their
efforts on our behalf.  But we do need to point out that the Interior bill needs to pass in
order for the increased funding to take effect.  In addition to the above Senators,
contact your congressmen in both the House and Senate and urge them to support any
amendment that would increase funding for education.  Stay tuned, and we'll let you
know what happens with these proposals!!!<P>

<CENTER><H3><B>HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM/MENTAL HEALTH PARITY 
<BR>
</CENTER></H3><BR></B> <p>


Reston, VA -- President Clinton has sent a letter to Congressman Newt Gingrich
(R-GA),
Speaker of the House, urging the House to quickly enact several important health
reform
provisions that were passed by the Senate last week.  One that is of extreme
importance to 
children with exceptionalities is entitled the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 (S. 2031). 
Sponsored by Senators Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Paul Wellstone (D-MN), the
provision
would prohibit health plans from establishing separate lifetime and annual limits for
mental
health benefits than those limits that exist for physical health services. This provision
has been
added to the HUD/VA appropriations bill that is currently being considered by
Congress.<P>

<b>Original Parity Provision Dropped in Conference</b><P>

A previous mental health parity provision was originally included in the Senate's version
of
the health insurance reform bill that was recently signed by President Clinton.  The
original
provision would have prevented insurers from imposing any cost-sharing requirements
or other
limitations on mental health coverage that they do not impose for physical illnesses.
Business
groups complained that the cost of this change would make it impossible for them to
afford
health coverage for their workers. Senator Domenici, one of the primary sponsors,
offered a
compromise to prohibit lifetime caps or annual limits, which was supported by the
mental
health community. Yet even this compromise was unacceptable to the business
community.  It
was passed by the Senate, but then stripped off the health insurance bill by the
House/Senate
Conference Committee. <P>

Since the House expressed strong opposition to the previous mental health parity
amendment,
it will probably be extremely difficult to keep this new provision from being stripped from
the
HUD/VA bill as well, even with President Clinton's written support of the proposal. <P>

Stay tuned!<P>

<CENTER><H3><B>   LITTLE TIME LEFT TO HOLD COMPREHENSIVE
CONFERENCE ON IDEA<BR>
</CENTER></H3><BR></B> <p>

Reston, VA -- With only 10 legislative days left on the congressional
calendar, it's becoming doubtful that there will be adequate time for Congress to hold a
comprehensive, thorough conference on the House and Senate IDEA reauthorization
bills. <P>

As we have posted several times over the past few months, there are a variety of
issues in both
bills with which CEC has serious problems.  Those problems need to be carefully sorted
and
removed from any final legislation.  There are also some strong features in each bill
which need
to be carefully incorporated into a final version.  In order to do both in a thoughtful
manner,
however, Congress must hold a joint House/Senate conference. <P>

Some of the central concerns which CEC has raised are contained in the following letter
from
July:<P>

CEC Letter To Senate and House Committee Members<br>
July 11, 1996<P>

This letter, from the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC),  is on behalf of 52,000
educators,
researchers, parents, and others who advocate on behalf of children with disabilities
and gifted
children.  As we approach the long-awaited conference on the reauthorization of IDEA,
CEC is
compelled to remind you once again about the remaining issues about which we have
major
concerns.  We ask your assistance in working with us as we support your efforts in the
completion of this reauthorization. <P>
  
As you well know, CEC has worked in good faith with you throughout the last several
years on
this very difficult reauthorization process.   We appreciate all the effort that you and
your staff
have invested in this important legislation.  It certainly has not been easy, and while we
have
sometimes disagreed, we have all been united in our belief in the value and importance
of IDEA
to America's children and families. <P>

CEC is well aware that this process has been one of compromise on everyones' part,
including
ours.  Be assured that, at this point, we remain committed to the process.  In fact, CEC
is pleased
about a number of IDEA changes included in the current Senate and House bills.  We
must say,
however, that commitment to the process is becoming increasingly difficult as we
proceed and
issues of paramount importance to our membership remain unresolved.  These major
issues
include:<P>

<ul><li><b> Discretionary Programs</b> - The discretionary programs included under
Parts C-G of the
     act are the foundation and support of efforts to ensure the availability of services for
all
     children with disabilities.  These efforts include research, demonstration, training,
     technical assistance and other support activities which assist in ensuring that the
goals of
     IDEA are met.  Widespread support exists for maintaining current law in this area.
This is
     clearly CEC's preference.  However, working with existing bills, the Senate language
     provides a thoughtful organizational structure that could be strengthened if language
is
     added to ensure support for all existing authorities across all age ranges of children.
<p> 
<li><b>     FAPE</b> - The most important principle of the IDEA is the guarantee of a
free appropriate
     public education to ALL children with disabilities.  Over the last 20 years, the courts,
up
     through the Supreme Court, have supported the concept of "all children" without
     exception.  CEC is strongly opposed to any exception to this guarantee and
therefore
     opposes provisions in both bills that allow the cessation of services for some
children. 
     While CEC is firmly committed to strong disciplinary provisions to keep our schools
     safe, our members do not believe it is ever good public policy to deny children an
     education.<P>

<li><b>     Qualified Personnel</b> - Special education, related services and early
intervention always
     should be provided by qualified personnel.  To accomplish this, CEC believes in the
     state's responsibility to set and ensure professionally recognized standards for
individuals
     providing such services.  These standards may include paraprofessionals, or other
career
     ladders within specific disciplines, as long as staff in these positions have the
necessary
     training, perform tasks for which they are qualified, and have the appropriate level of
     supervision.  CEC does not support the use of waivers to address personnel
shortages.  In
     addition, CEC is committed to retaining current IDEA language that allows only
those
     institutions that have professionally recognized standards to receive discretionary
funds
     under IDEA.<P>

<li><b>     Paperwork Burden</b> - CEC is deeply disturbed that both bills, if
implemented as now
     drafted, will require greater paperwork for all participants in the educational process. 
     Many, if not most, of these changes to IDEA are clearly "good practice" particularly
     those that further the parent-professional partnership.  However, current law allows
these
     practices which represent effective implementation strategies that many school
districts
     have already adopted.  The balance required here is to encourage good practice
and
     address difficulties in implementation with the overwhelming desire not to increase
     paperwork and administrative burden.  To encourage the practices addressed in
these
     changes, CEC recommends that appropriate language be included in the
conference
     report and that targeted technical assistance be made available to states and local
school
     districts.<p>

<li><b>     Disruptive Behavior</b> - CEC is strongly opposed to any proposals to
amend IDEA that
     would allow unilateral placement changes for children with disabilities as a
consequence
     of "disruptive behavior".  Provisions as contained in both the House and the Senate
bills
     go significantly beyond any reasonable considerations of safety. Behavior is an
     instructional issue which can be appropriately resolved through the IEP process by
the
     parents, student and school personnel within the provisions of the current statute. 
No
     change is necessary.     Further, terms such as "disruptive behavior"as specified in
the
     Senate bill or as descibed  in the House bill are vague and subject to multiple
individual
     interpretations.  This would lead to significant increase in litigation that would be
     necessary to define this subjective term. 
     Further, CEC is most concerned that changes under consideration in the Senate
could
     result in students being placed in an alternative education placement based upon a
     subjective determination of "disruptive behavior".  In many cases, we fear this would
be
     an inappropriate home placement.  We must insist that protections of the child's right
to
     the availability of FAPE in the least restrictive environment be maintained.  
Placement
     options must include the full continuum and decisions about placement must be
based
     upon the student's needs in accordance with the IEP.<P>

     Maintaining behavior conducive to learning is necessary to meet the goal of an
effective
     instructional program for all children.  The question becomes, given the undefinable
     nature of "disruptive behavior", how could this new provision be applied to children
with
     disabilities without establishing a double standard, raising civil rights concerns. 
While
     disruptive behavior is a problem for schools across the country, there is no evidence
that
     this problem can be attributed disproportionately to children with
disabilities.</ul><P>

In conclusion, CEC asks for your continued support as a member of the authorizing
committee to
work with us in ensuring that the final IDEA bill protects and enhances this important
legislation.
Be assured, we are continuing to offer assistance to staff to help resolve these major
problems
with the current bills and to address other smaller but important issues still unresolved. 
Please
contact us at your convenience for any information or assistance we can provide. 
CEC's
members are committed to protecting IDEA and appreciate your support for programs
for
children with disabilities and their families. <P>

Sincerely,<P>

Nancy Safer<br>
CEC Executive Director<P>

<hr>
As we mentioned earlier, given the short amount of time left in the legislative calendar,
it would
be extremely difficult for Congress to hold a thorough conference.  Nonetheless, there
must be a
thorough conference in order to work out the complex, detailed issues involving both
bills.<P>

<center><b>ACTION: Please contact your Representatives and Senators <br>and urge
them not to accept any
legislative proposal that would eliminate <br>a vitally needed House/Senate
conference!!!!</b></center><P>

<br>PASSES SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE</H3><BR></B> </center>


Reston, VA -- The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor,
Health and Human Services, and Education passed our appropriations bill for FY 1997
yesterday.  The subcommittee added $16 million more to IDEA programs than the
House did,
for a total of $3.262 billion.  Additional monies under the Senate bill were added to Part
B
($10 million), Innovation and Development ($2 million), Personnel Development ($2
million),
and Parent Training ($2 million).  The Senate kept the additional $900,000 that the
House
appropriated for Media and Captioning Services over FY  96 levels.  All other programs
received level funding under both bills.  The full Committee was expected to consider
the bill this afternoon.<P>

<CENTER><H3><B>FY 1997 APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS<BR>
</CENTER></H3><BR></B> 



The FY 1997 Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill (H.R. 3755) was not taken by
the Senate subcommittee before Congress recessed early last month.  Now that Congress is
back in session through the beginning of October, the Senate will hopefully mark up the bill
relatively quickly.  However, because there are several funding bills that are still not ready for
President Clinton's signature -- including the Labor, HHS bill -- it seems very likely that an
overall continuing resolution (CR) will be passed to keep these programs funded through
October 1, which is the beginning of the next fiscal year. The passage of a CR would trigger
release of the $1.3 billion that Senator Trent Lott set aside for such an occurrence. Once the
$1.3 billion is released, it is possible that some of this could be added to the Labor, HHS bill. 
Stay tuned!   <P>

<b>IDEA Reauthorization:</b><p>

As you know, the House has passed its reauthorization bill (H.R. 3268), while the Senate's
bill (S. 1578) has not yet been brought to the floor.  With only a few weeks left to complete
the reauthorization process before Congress recesses for the year, something drastic needs to
happen in order for both houses to agree on common legislation that would also be acceptable
to President Clinton.  Should the Senate overcome its current deadlock and pass a bill, it
would need to conferenced with the House's version (the two are quite different in several
areas), and both houses would then need to pass the compromise bill. The Senate bill is
currently stuck due to controversy surrounding several issues: funding, attorneys' fees, and
discipline (see earlier updates for more information). <P>

It is possible for this process to be completed before Congress adjourns in early October, but
the time frame is exceedingly tight.  Realistically, the Senate bill will probably need to be
acted upon during this first week of September in order for the process to be completed in
time.     <P>

A relatively uncontentious conference committee could somewhat accelerate and ease the
reauthorization process.  Throughout the August congressional recess, House and Senate staff,
along with CEC and other groups, have attempted to develop a package that would be suitable
to both houses of Congress.  If a compromise bill can be agreed upon, the House and Senate
could then concurrently pass this bill, thereby replacing their current proposals.  CEC will
continue to closely monitor and participate in the ongoing process, and we'll provide updates
as they develop. <P>

<CENTER><H3><B>MESSAGE FROM CONGRESSMAN PORTER RE: IDEA FUNDING<BR>
</CENTER></H3><BR></B> 


In response to concerns about the possibility of IDEA programs not receiving funding if
a
reauthorization does not go through this year, CEC received a statement from Rep.
John Porter
(R-IL), the Chair of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education
Appropriations
Subcommittee, concerning funding for IDEA programs for FY 1997, but does not
specifically
discuss FY 1998.  Following is his office's statement:<P>

<dd>    "I serve as Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee which funds
     IDEA.  For Fiscal Year 1997, I included a total of $3.246 billion for special
     education programs for children with disabilities in the annual appropriation bill. 
     This funding level is significantly above the amount provided in fiscal year 1996. <P>
     
<dd>     I strongly support reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education
     Act (IDEA).  I am hopeful that the Congress will complete consideration of the
     IDEA reauthorization bill this year and that President Clinton will support this
     legislation.<P>
     
<dd>    Regardless of whether IDEA is reauthorized, I will continue to appropriate
     funding for IDEA through the subcommittee which I chair."<P>
     
In response to this statement, CEC put together a letter to the congressman's office, as
follows:<P>


August 21, 1996<P>


The Honorable John Porter<br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
Washington, D.C. 20510<P>


<dd>     Dear Representative Porter:<P>
     
<dd>     I was very pleased to read your recent statement of support for appropriations
     under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  Your leadership
     has been essential and will be necessary again this year.<P>
     
<dd>     The many parents and professionals who make up CEC are deeply concerned
     about IDEA reauthorization.  There will be a reauthorization: it is just taking
     longer than anticipated. Unfortunately, while the dialogue on reauthorization
     continues,  the discretionary programs face increasing risk due to their lack of
     authorizing legislation.  Your recent statement of support for funding these
     programs regardless of the reauthorization timetable provides important
     reassurance that you will continue to work for the best interests of children with
     disabilities and their families.<P>
     
<Dd>     Regardless of when reauthorization is completed, CEC appreciates your
     Congressional leadership in recognizing the importance of each of the
     discretionary programs in providing the infrastructure and R&D functions
     essential to accomplishing the mission of IDEA. <P>
     
     Sincerely,<P>
     
     
     
     Nancy D. Safer<br>
     Executive Director<P>

<CENTER><H3><B>SUBSTITUTE BILL WOULD INCLUDE MAJORITY OF COALITION'S RECOMMENDATIONS<BR>
</CENTER></H3><BR></B><P>

Following is a letter which CEC delivered to Senate and House Committee Members to inform
them of the issues in reauthorization which with we still have major concern, and which
constitute our "bottom-line issues."<P>

<b>CEC Letter To Senate and House Committee Members<br>
July 11, 1996</b><P>

This letter, from the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC),  is on behalf of 52,000 educators,
researchers, parents, and others who advocate on behalf of children with disabilities and gifted
children.  As we approach the long-awaited conference on the reauthorization of IDEA, CEC is
compelled to remind you once again about the remaining issues about which we have major
concerns.  We ask your assistance in working with us as we support your efforts in the
completion of this reauthorization.  <P>
  
As you well know, CEC has worked in good faith with you throughout the last several years on
this very difficult reauthorization process.   We appreciate all the effort that you and your staff
have invested in this important legislation.  It certainly has not been easy, and while we have
sometimes disagreed, we have all been united in our belief in the value and importance of IDEA
to America's children and families.  <P>

CEC is well aware that this process has been one of compromise on everyones' part, including
ours.  Be assured that, at this point, we remain committed to the process.  In fact, CEC is pleased
about a number of IDEA changes included in the current Senate and House bills.  We must say,
however, that commitment to the process is becoming increasingly difficult as we proceed and
issues of paramount importance to our membership remain unresolved.  These major issues
include:<P>

<ul><li><b>Discretionary Programs</b>.   The discretionary programs included under Parts C-G of the act are the foundation and support of efforts to ensure the availability of services for all
children with disabilities.  These efforts include research, demonstration, training, technical
assistance and other support activities which assist in ensuring that the goals of IDEA are met. 
Widespread support exists for maintaining current law in this area. This is clearly CEC's
preference.  However, working with existing bills, the Senate language provides a thoughtful
organizational structure that could be strengthened if language is added to ensure support for all
existing authorities across all age ranges of children. <P> 

<li><b>FAPE</b>.   The most important principle of the IDEA is the guarantee of a free
appropriate public education to ALL children with disabilities.  Over the last 20 years, the
courts, up through the Supreme Court, have supported the concept of "all children" without
exception.  CEC is strongly opposed to any exception to this guarantee and therefore opposes
provisions in both bills that allow the cessation of services for some children.  While CEC is
firmly committed to strong disciplinary provisions to keep our schools safe, our members do not
believe it is ever good public policy to deny children an education.<P>

<li><b>Qualified Personnel</b>.   Special education, related services and early intervention
always should be provided by qualified personnel.  To accomplish this, CEC believes in the
state's responsibility to set and ensure professionally recognized standards for individuals
providing such services.  These standards may include paraprofessionals, or other career ladders
within specific disciplines, as long as staff in these positions have the necessary training, perform
tasks for which they are qualified, and have the appropriate level of supervision.  CEC does not
support the use of waivers to address personnel shortages.  In addition, CEC is committed to
retaining current IDEA language that allows only those institutions that have professionally
recognized standards to receive discretionary funds under IDEA.<P>

<li><b>Paperwork Burden</b>.   CEC is deeply disturbed that both bills, if implemented as now
drafted, will require greater paperwork for all participants in the educational process.  Many, if
not most, of these changes to IDEA are clearly "good practice" particularly those that further the
parent-professional partnership.  However, current law allows these practices which represent
effective implementation strategies that many school districts have already adopted.  The balance
required here is to encourage good practice and address difficulties in implementation with the
overwhelming desire not to increase paperwork and administrative burden.  To encourage the
practices addressed in these changes, CEC recommends that appropriate language be included in
the conference report and that targeted technical assistance be made available to states and local
school districts.<P>

<li><B>Disruptive Behavior</b>.   CEC is strongly opposed to any proposals to amend IDEA
that would allow unilateral placement changes for children with disabilities as a consequence of
"disruptive behavior".  Provisions as contained in both the House and the Senate bills go
significantly beyond any reasonable considerations of safety. Behavior is an instructional issue
which can be appropriately resolved through the IEP process by the parents, student and school
personnel within the provisions of the current statute.  No change is necessary.     Further, terms
such as "disruptive behavior"as specified in the Senate bill or as descibed  in the House bill are
vague and subject to multiple individual interpretations.  This would lead to significant increase
in litigation that would be necessary to define this subjective term. <P>

Further, CEC is most concerned that changes under consideration in the Senate could result in
students being placed in an alternative education placement based upon a subjective
determination of "disruptive behavior".  In many cases, we fear this would be an inappropriate
home placement.  We must insist that protections of the child's right to the availability of FAPE
in the least restrictive environment be maintained.   Placement options must include the full
continuum and decisions about placement must be based upon the student's needs in accordance
with the IEP.<P>

Maintaining behavior conducive to learning is necessary to meet the goal of an effective
instructional program for all children.  The question becomes, given the undefinable nature of
"disruptive behavior", how could this new provision be applied to children with disabilities
without establishing a double standard, raising civil rights concerns.  While disruptive behavior
is a problem for schools across the country, there is no evidence that this problem can be
attributed disproportionately to children with disabilities.</ul><P>

In conclusion, CEC asks for your continued support as a member of the authorizing committee to
work with us in ensuring that the final IDEA bill protects and enhances this important legislation.
Be assured, we are continuing to offer assistance to staff to help resolve these major problems

<strong>IDEA listed in Unfunded Mandate Document</strong><P>

The U.S. Advisory Committee on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR) Commission
voted against accepting their own final report, by a vote of 7-13.  CEC -- along with a
number of disability, education, and citizen's rights groups -- had opposed the report,
which was charged with making recommendations on changing laws that are unfunded
federal mandates.  Although the report was voted down and probably will never be
distributed, it is important for us to consider what was said about IDEA.  These
comments may resurface later.<P>

The recently released ACIR draft report included recommended changes to IDEA, in
spite of the fact that IDEA is neither unfunded nor a mandate.  Participation in IDEA is
voluntary and is not based upon Congressional fiat, but on Constitutional grounds. 
Although the draft final report of the ACIR pointed out that IDEA is voluntary, it
nevertheless included IDEA in the draft report.  For a copy of the complete
ACIR draft language relating to IDEA, please contact <a
href="mailto:jackib@cec.sped.org"> Jacki Bootel </a> at CEC.<P>

While CEC recommended many of the changes that were included in the draft report
(full funding at 40% of excess costs, cutting back on unnecessary paperwork,
increasing use of alternative dispute resolution), we were very concerned about efforts
to limit the private right of action, any infringement on due process protections, and the
inclusion of IDEA in an unfunded mandate document.<P>

<strong>Federal Circuit Court Upholds FAPE After Expulsion</strong><P>

The Department of Education has long held that schools cannot deny educational
services to students who are expelled for reasons unrelated to their disabilities.  This
opinion was upheld by the 4th Federal Circuit Court in <em>Virginia Dept of Ed v
Riley</em>.   The Commonwealth of Virginia challenged the Department policy when it
refused to provide services to students who had been expelled or suspended.  When
the U.S. Department of Education called for a hearing in order to withhold funds from
Virginia, the case came to national attention.  IDEA clearly states that all children with
disabilities have a right to FAPE.  CEC has always supported the continuation of FAPE
and is pleased with the court's decision. <P>

<strong>America Goes Back to School</strong><P>

The Department of Education, along with CEC and hundreds of other organizations,
schools, businesses, community groups, etc., have joined in the "Partnership for Family
Involvement in Education."  Among its other efforts, the Partnership members will be
holding back-to-school activities all over the country early this fall.  It's very important
that educators, parents, and advocates of exceptional children are involved in these
events.  If you are planning back-to-school events in your community, the Department
of Education would like to know about them.  For a copy of the "America Goes Back to
School" form, please contact <a href="mailto:agbts@ed.gov">Jennifer Ballen </a> at
the U.S. Department of Education.<P>

<strong>Talking Points for Local Meetings & Campaign Events</strong><P>

<ul><LI>Changes in welfare and federal education funding will result in local schools
receiving less support from Washington than in years past.  Do state/local
officials/candidates intend to let local children absorb the losses by passing on these
cuts, or how do they intend to make up the difference?<P>

<li>Inclusion has led to increasing numbers of children with disabilities being served in
regular classrooms.  How do school board members and/or administrators intend to assure
that regular education teachers have the training and support they need to effectively
serve all children?<P>

<li>Technology has opened up a world of information to students who have access to it. 
Are your local schools wired?  If not now, when?  How do leaders plan to provide basic
technological education to those who need it while assisting those who are already
proficient in refining and expanding their skills and knowledge?<P>

<li>Discipline has become a very important topic in education.  What alternative
programs do local leaders/school officials have in place (or intend to develop) so that
children who are currently dangerous to themselves or others can get the quality
education they need in an alternative setting until their skills and behaviors are
appropriate for a regular classroom setting? </ul><p>

<strong>Rehabilitation Act Reauthorization Meetings</strong><P>

The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is a major civil rights law that has many implications for
children with disabilities.  Section 504 of the Act protects the rights of  "any person who
(I) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such
person's major life activities, (ii) has a record of such an impairment, or (iii) is regarded
as having such an impairment."<P>

The Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) will be holding
public meetings to solicit comments on possible improvements in the law.  The
meetings will be in Atlanta, Georgia, on September 17; in Chicago, Illinois, on
September 19, and in Bellevue, Washington, on October 29.   Written comments are
also being accepted.  For further information about the meetings or on sending written
comments, call us at CEC's Department of Public Policy or contact Beverlee Stafford at
the U.S. Department of Education at (202) 205-8831.<P>

<strong>Javits Receiving Increasing Attention from Administration</strong><P>

Although the Javits Gifted and Talented program is a very small commitment, in federal
terms, it is getting more attention in the FY97 budget rhetoric than it received in FY 96. 
The Department of Education, in its chart comparing appropriations and the President's
1997 requests, includes Javits in spite of its small size.  The Department's July
Community Update listed only six "major" education programs on its comparison chart,
including Javits.  Perhaps this increased interest on the part of the administration,
coupled with advocacy from groups such as CEC, will result in this program regaining
some of the more than 60% of its funding that was cut from the initial appropriation in
1995 through 1996.  Congress needs more education about how much this very small
program has improved the education of the nation's more than 5 million gifted and
talented children.<P>

<strong>Completion of IDEA Reauthorization Becomes Problematic <br>
Due to Time Constraints</strong><P>

With each passing day, it is more and more unlikely that reauthorization will be
completed this year.  As this update was completed, the Congress had just recessed
for its annual month-long August break, so nothing more will happen until after Labor
Day.  The Senate failed to give final approval to its version of IDEA reauthorization prior
to this recess.<P>

The Senate is scheduled to reconvene on September 3, and the House a day later. 
With only a few short weeks from Labor Day until the anticipated adjournment of the
104th Congress,  the prospects for completion of the reauthorization of IDEA this year
look grim indeed.<P>

The bill is still being held from Senate floor action by three Senators - Mr. Gorton
(R-WA), Mr. Gregg (R-NH), and Mr. Ashcroft (R-MO).  These members have asked that
a time-limited debate occur on the Senate floor to address their remaining issues which
include:  discipline, attorneys fees, and cost.  The Democrats have rejected the plan to
have a time-limited debate on the Senate floor.  It is generally believed that any such
debate would not result in any improvements to the existing bill. <P>

Regardless, Senate committee and subcommittee staff and members are still
attempting to move the bill along.  In mid-July, Senator Frist (R-TN), chairman of the
Subcommittee on Disability Policy, and Senator Harkin (D-IA), Ranking Democrat on
the subcommittee, asked members of the consensus group that developed the House
IDEA compromise measure to meet to develop a few amendments that could be added
to the current Senate bill that might result in agreement from all sides.  The consensus
group, with representatives from the disability, special education and general education
communities, met several times but no progress was made. <P>

In addition, Senators Frist and Harkin recently have been attempting to negotiate a
"manager's package" to address the remaining areas of disagreement.  No details on
the pieces of this package have been available to the community, which is a cause for
concern at this point.  If agreement is reached by committee members, this package
would be inserted into the bill prior to the floor vote.  The "manager's package" does
offer an opportunity to negotiate remaining issues while avoiding a potentially long and
bitter debate on IDEA on the Senate floor. <P>

As you know, the House bill, H.R. 3268, passed the full House on June 10, 1996.  If
and when  S. 1578 passes the Senate, the conference committee faces a difficult task
of resolving the differences in the two bills to create a final bill that can pass both
houses of Congress before the October 4 projected adjournment.<P>

<strong>Welfare Reform Legislation</strong><P>

In mid-July both houses of Congress passed welfare reform bills that will end this
country's 61-year history of promising support to the impoverished.  President Clinton
signed the compromise bill, saying that it was a good first step, but need some
refinement.  It is estimated that the bill will save $55 billion over six years over the
estimated cost under the current system.   CEC did not support passage of the bill
because of its likely impact upon children and especially upon children of immigrants. 
While giving states wide discretion to develop their own programs, the legislation
requires states to:<P>

<ul><li>limit lifetime welfare to five years<br>
<li>require able adults to work after two years (up to 20% may be exempted)<br>
<li>end food stamps and financial assistance to convicted drug offenders (their families
would still be eligible)<br>
<li>allow Medicaid to be given to families on welfare and for one year after work is
resumed<br>
<li>limit food stamps for childless adults (18-50) to three months every three years
(unless they are working)<br>
<li>prohibit food stamps and Supplemental Security Income to most legal immigrants
who have not become citizens</ul><P>
    
Along with CEC, many groups (i.e., Child Welfare League, Children's Defense Fund,
and Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities) believe this bill will be very detrimental for
children.<P>
  
<ul><li>Many children with serious disabilities will lose Supplemental Security Income
due to changes in eligibility<li>
<li>Children older than 13 who have disabilities and are cut from SSI will lose their
Medicaid support<br>
<li>Most children whose parents lose their welfare will also lose their assistance<br>
<li>An estimated 1.1 million more children will become impoverished as a result of
decreased or lost federal support than under current law. </ul><P>

A House amendment that would have provided vouchers for basic services to children
whose parents had lost their eligibility was defeated. Although he has promised to sign
the bill, the President said that it will push too many children into poverty.  He vowed to
write legislation next year that will provide more protection for both children and legal
immigrants.<P>
 
A House provision that would have required nonprofit organizations (but not for-profits)
to print disclaimers on all advocacy efforts was taken out of the final bill.  This provision
had nothing to do with welfare.  It was once a separate bill that could not pass on its
own and was subsequently attached to this bill.  Its major result would have been an
increase in paperwork and paper use for nonprofit organizations like CEC.<P>

<strong>Health Care Reform</strong><P>

The bill designed to make it easier for people to keep their health insurance when they
switch jobs or lose their job passed both houses of Congress in early August and
President Clinton promised to sign the bill into law.  The general goals and provisions of
the bill received widespread support, but negotiations were very careful on two key
issues:<P>
<ul><li>Medical Savings Accounts (the size and scope of a test of these accounts is
unresolved)<br>
<li>Mental Health Parity (most, if not all, protections in this area were
removed)</ul><P>

The primary goal of this bill is to increase the availability of insurance to people who
lose their jobs, switch jobs, or who have prior medical conditions.  CEC strongly
supported efforts to improve mental health parity for children and adults.  Due to the
recency of final passage of this bill, we have not yet received the final version.  We will
update you further in upcoming postings.<P>

<strong>FY  97 Appropriations</strong><P>

The House passed a fiscal year 1997 appropriations bill for Labor, Health and Human
Services, and Education on July 11 by a 216-211 vote.  The House bill would authorize
$27.4 billion in education spending, down from $30.3 billion allocated in 1996.  The bill
would authorize level-funding of part B of IDEA, which would neither account for
increased numbers of students nor inflation.  Discretionary programs under IDEA and
the Javits Act would also be level-funded (with the exception of a much-needed
$900,000 increase in Media and Captioning Services).<P>

The Senate subcommittee responsible for education appropriations is not expected to
meet until September, after Congress returns from its summer recess.  The proposed
Senate bill currently authorizes $850 million less for education than the House-passed
bill.  It is possible that this number could be increased from $1.3 billion in budget
authority that Majority Leader Lott set aside for later distribution.<P>

<CENTER><H3><B>FY97 LABOR, HHS, EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS BILL<BR> PASSES COMMITTEE
</CENTER></H3></B> <P>


The House Appropriations Committee adopted the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill for FY 1997 on Tuesday, June 25.  The bill passed along party lines, 27-17.  Overall, the bill is $400 million below the FY '96 enacted level for discretionary education programs.  No changes were made to education funding levels during the committee markup.<P>

If you'll recall, the House Subcommittee mostly level-funded programs (kept the same funding level as in FY 1996)  under IDEA, with one exception: adding $900,000 to the Media and Captioning Services program. The full Committee agreed to those same funding levels.  <P>

The bill is expected to go to the House floor after the July 4th recess.  The Senate Labor, HHS, Education appropriations subcommittee is expected to act after July 16.<P>

We'll keep you updated!!!<P>

<CENTER><H3><B>HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE <BR>
MOSTLY LEVEL-FUNDS IDEA FOR FY  97
</CENTER></H3></B> <P>


The House Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations subcommittee
completed action on its FY 1997 appropriations bill early Friday morning, June 14.  Compared
to last year's House markup, which in effect originally zeroed out many of the support programs
under IDEA, the subcommittee level-funded all IDEA programs except for one, the Media and
Captioning Services program, which received a $900,000 boost over FY  96 levels.  Of course,
level funding does not take into account inflation or increased student enrollment under IDEA. 
The House also did not adopt President Clinton's recommendation that the 14 support programs
be consolidated into 5 programs. <P>

During the subcommittee markup, Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD) offered an amendment to
"Maintain Commitment to Local Schools," which would have added a total of $2.6 billion to
several programs.  Under this amendment, Part B of IDEA would have received an additional
$300 million.  Unfortunately, the amendment was defeated on a party line vote.   <P>

The Javits Gifted and Talented Students Program was also level-funded at $3 million, down two-thirds from its 1995 authorized level.  <P>

Following are the amounts that each IDEA program would receive under the subcommittee's FY
 97 bill:<P>

Thursday, June 20.  Stay tuned!!!<P>

<CENTER><H3><B>IF IDEA REAUTHORIZATION IS TERMINATED<BR>
</CENTER></H3><BR></B> 


The consequence of terminating the reauthorization process now in motion under S. 1578 and
H.R. 3268 would be:<br>

<ol><li>IDEA Parts C through H (the secretary-discretionary support programs and the Early
     Intervention Program) would be without authorizations, thus subject to complete
     termination.<P>
<li> New bills would need to be introduced in the House and Senate for the reauthorization
     of Parts C through H.<P>
<li> These new bills would need to travel through the decision-making process of
     subcommittee, full committee, full chamber in both the House and Senate, and then a
     House/Senate conference, all to be done without controversial attachments which might
     bog them down.<P>
<li> All of this would need to be done in the relatively few remaining "legislative days" of
     June, July and September (August is a recess period).<P>
<li> These reauthorizations could be for a time period of as many as five years, or for one
     year only.<P>
<li>If one year only, the entire reauthorization process of IDEA as we are experiencing it
     now could start from scratch again in the next Congress.  We would then be well into
     the fourth year of the current unfinished reauthorization process.<P>
<li> Whether the current reauthorization ceases or not, it is generally agreed that there will
     be an amendment to IDEA to deal with discipline, even if it is attached to some other
     legislation.</OL><P>

<CENTER><H3><B>HOUSE PASSES IDEA LEGISLATION<BR>
</CENTER></H3><BR></B> 


At about 4:00 p.m. EST, the full House approved H.R. 3268, the IDEA Improvement Act of
1996.  The House considered the bill under suspension of the rules; a process that prohibits
amendments, limits debate to 40 minutes, and requires a two-thirds majority vote for final
passage.  So, the bill has not changed from the Committee-passed version.<P>

The full Senate may take up the bill this week.  Once a bill is passed, a conference committee --
made up of both House and Senate members -- will convene, and iron out the differences
between the two bills.<P>

CEC will update you as events occur.<P>

<CENTER><H3><B>SUMMARY OF CHANGES FROM ORIGINAL H.R. 3268<BR>
</CENTER></H3><BR></B> 

                                
<center><b>Summary of Changes from Original H.R. 3268 as Passed by the Full U.S. House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee
</b></center><P>


The House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities completed its
markup of the IDEA reauthorization on May 30 at approximately 6:00 P.M.  The bill is
now officially reported to the full House.  Key amendments from the chairperson, U.S.
Rep. William Goodling (R-PA) are included in the following summary of changes.<P>

<ul><li><b>Professional Development.</b> The substitute bill would add a new
subsection authorizing activities for professional development.  <P>

<li><b>National Activities.</b>  The Secretary is authorized to make grants to support
activities of national significance, including: the development, evaluation, demonstration
or dissemination of effective personnel preparation practices for personnel to work with
children with disabilities; promoting the transferability of licensure and certification of
teachers and administrators among State and local jurisdictions; developing and
disseminating models that prepare teachers with strategies, including behavioral
management techniques, for addressing the conduct of children with disabilities that
impedes their learning and that of others; and supporting HBCUs and IHEs with
minority enrollments of at least 25 percent for the purpose of preparing personnel. <P>

<li><b>Low Incidence and Early Intervention Personnel.</b>  The Secretary may make
grants to support the preparation for personnel who provide educational and related
services to children with low-incidence disabilities and personnel who will provide early
intervention services to infants and toddlers with disabilities.  Funds for scholarships,
with necessary stipends and allowances, are authorized under this part. <P>
     In order to receive funds under this section, an application must propose to provide
preparation that addresses a significant need, as shown by letters from one or more
States stating that the State intends to accept successful completion of the proposed
personnel preparation as meeting State personnel standards and needs personnel in
the areas or areas of preparation as identified in the State's CSPD or the State
improvement plan.<P>

<li><b>Leadership Personnel.</b>  The Secretary may make grants to prepare
educational, related service and early intervention leadership personnel, including
teacher-preparation faculty, administrators, researchers, supervisors, and principals. 
Activities include the preparation of personnel at the advanced graduate, doctoral, or
post-doctoral levels and professional development of leadership personnel.  Funds for
scholarships, with necessary stipends and allowances, are authorized under this part. 
The Secretary will give preference for grants to IHEs that have successfully integrated
the professional development of general and special education personnel.<P>

     For the low incidence/early intervention grants and the leadership personnel grants,
the applicant must ensure that individuals who are prepared under the proposed project
will subsequently perform work related to their preparation or repay all or part of the
cost of the preparation.    <P>

<li><b>Outreach. </b> The Secretary will develop a plan for providing outreach
services to HBCUs and other IHEs whose minority student enrollment is at least 25
percent, nonprofit and for profit agencies at least 51 percent owned or controlled by one
or more minority individuals, underrepresented populations, and other eligible
institutions.  The Secretary is authorized 1 percent of the funds appropriated for the
professional    development subpart to implement this plan.<P>

<li><b>Report. </b> The Secretary must submit to Congress a final report on the
progress toward meeting the goals of this section not later than January 31 of each
year.<P>

Other provisions under Part D relating to professional development for low incidence
disabilities are deleted.<P>

<li><b>Minority Language.</b>  The substitute bill would reinsert the extensive minority
language found in the Findings section of current law.  <P>

<li><b>Developmentally Delayed.  </b> The substitute bill changes language allowing
States to use the term "child with a disability" for children experiencing developmental
delays for children aged 3 to 9 to also require the LEA to approve the use of this
definition.  <P>

<li><b>IEP. </b> Several changes are made to the IEP language in the substitute bill,
including: changing the term "impairment" to disability throughout this section;  having
"involvement and progress in" the general curriculum replace "participation and
progress in..." throughout this section and the bill;  "annual objectives" is changed back
to "annual goals";  the substitute would include "benchmarks or short term objectives";
"developmentally" is deleted from "appropriate activities" for preschoolers in this section
and throughout the bill; language is modified on the attainment of annual goals from "to
attain" to "progress toward the attainment"; and clarifies language that when a child is
at least one year before reaching the age of majority he or she has been informed of
his or her rights that will transfer to the child on reaching the age of majority. <P>

<li><b>IEP Team. </b> Language is clarified that at the discretion of the parent or the
agency, other individuals who have special expertise or knowledge regarding the
abilities and disability of the child, including, as appropriate, related services personnel
who are or who will be working with the child, can be included on the IEP Team.  Also
changes language requiring a team member who has the authority to commit resources
to a member who is knowledgeable about the availability of resources.<P>

<li><b>Development of the IEP. </b> The development of the IEP portion of the bill is
changed to: delete "duration of early intervention program" as a component to consider;
adds interventions and strategies to help the child behave in an appropriate and
responsible manner conducive to learning; and adds language that states that in the
case of a child who is deaf, hear-of-hearing, blind or communicatively disabled,
consider the language and communication needs of the child. <P>

<li><b>No Additional Paperwork. </b> The substitute bill includes language stating that
nothing in this subsection is to be construed to decrease the amount of information that
a parent receives concerning the progress of the child or to increase the amount of
paperwork for the teachers, related services personnel and administrators of the
child.<P>

<li><b>Related Services.  </b> The substitute bill deletes curriculum specialists from
the related services definition.<P>

<li><b>Special Education. </b> The substitute bill deletes "related services" from the
definition of special education.<P>

<li><b>Supplementary Aids and Services.  </b> The substitute adds a definition of
supplementary aids and services and defines the term as aids, services and other
supports that are provided in regular education classes and other education-related
settings to enable children with disabilities to be educated with nondisabled children to
the maximum extent appropriate in accordance with the LRE section.<P>

<li><b>Indian Education. </b> The percentage the Secretary of the Interior is provided
to provide special education and related services for Indian children with disabilities is
changed from not more than 1 percent to an amount equal to 1.226 percent for Part B. 
For the Part H program the percentage is changed from 1 percent to 1.25 percent. <P>

<li><b>State Allotment. </b> The substitute adds language on State minimum allotment
that subject to the availability of appropriations for FY 1997 and following fiscal years,
the amount to each State shall not be less than an amount equal to one-third of one
percent of the remaining amount after  funds to the territories  and to the Secretary of
the Interior have been distributed.  The substitute bill also includes State maximum
allotment language that authorizes funds not more than an amount equal to the sum of
the number of children with disabilities multiplied by 40 percent of the average per-pupil
expenditure in public elementary and secondary schools.<P>

<li><b>State Set-aside.  </b> The substitute bill bumps up the State set-aside from 10
to not more than 25 percent or $450,000 whichever is greater for State activities for
State grants and preschool grants, as in current law.  States must submit a description
of how the funds will be used, how the funds will be allocated to meet State priorities
based on input from LEAs, and what percentage of the funds will be distributed to LEAs
by formula.  The State may use up to 3 percent of these funds for State administration.
<P>

<li><b>Child Find. </b> Language in the child find provisions is changed to read all
children with disabilities residing in the State, including children with disabilities
attending private schools, regardless of the severity of such disabilities, and who are in
need of special education and related services, are identified, located, and evaluated
and that a practical method is developed and implemented to determine which children
with disabilities are currently receiving needed special education and related services. 
This constitutes a return to current law.<P>

<li><b>Transition from Part C to Preschool Programs. </b> The substitute bill adds
provisions that requires the LEA will participate in transition planning conferences by
the designated lead agency.<P>

<li><b>CSPD. </b> The substitute bill reinstates provisions requiring the State to
establish and implement a comprehensive system of personnel development (CSPD). 
CSPD provisions are also added back in to the Part H program.<P>

<li><b>Personnel Standards.</b>  Language on the "exception" portion of the
personnel standards is modified for both Part B and Part H to allow the State to
temporarily suspend the standards consistent with State law, for the purpose of
recruiting and hiring for such shortage areas the most qualified available individuals
who are making progress in applicable coursework and for a period not to exceed 3
years.<P>

<li><b>Incidental Benefit. </b> The substitute modifies language to allow the LEAs to
use funds for the costs of special education and related services provided in a regular
class or education related setting to a child with a disability in accordance with the IEP,
even if one or more nondisabled children benefit from those services. <P>

<li><b>LEA Waivers. </b> The waiver program proposed in the passed subcommittee
bill that would have allowed waivers to 10 LEAs or groups of LEAs is eliminated in the
substitute.<P>

<li><b>Evaluation Procedures.</b>  Each LEA must ensure that the child is assessed
in all areas of suspected disability.<P>

<li><b>Eligibility. </b> The substitute bill will allow the determination of whether the
child is a child with a disability to be made by a team of qualified professionals and the
parent of the child.  The child shall not be determined to be a child with a disability
based on lack of instruction, including instruction in reading or math, limited English
proficiency, cultural or environmental factors, and economic disadvantage.<P>

<li><b>Reevaluation. </b> The substitute allows other qualified professionals, as
appropriate, to be a part of any reevaluation.<P>

<li><b>Parental Notice. </b> The substitute deletes previous language that would have
excepted parental notice for minor modifications to the child's education.<P>

<li><b>Notice of Complaint. </b> The substitute would require the parent or the
attorney to provide notice to the SEA or LEA prior to filing a complaint.  The notice must
include the name of the child, his or her address and the name of the school, a
description of the nature of the problem including all relevant facts, and the proposed
resolution.  The SEAwould be required to develop a model form to assist parents in
filing a complaint.<P>

<li><b>Procedural Safeguards Notice. </b> Language is changed to require a copy of
the procedural safeguards available to parents be given at a minimum upon initial
referral for evaluation, upon each notification of an IEP meeting and upon reevaluation
of the child, and upon registration of a complaint. <P>

<li><b>Mediation.</b>  The substitute bill would allow mediation to be terminated by
either the parents or the school after a good faith effort has been made.  The State will
determine whether or not attorneys may attend or otherwise participate in the mediation
process after offering the opportunity for parents and representatives of school districts
to participate in the mediation process without attorneys present prior to any due
process filing.<P>

<li><b>Attorney's Fees.  </b> The substitute states that attorneys' fees may not be
awarded relating to any meeting of the IEP Team unless such meeting is convened as
a result of a judicial action or proceeding.  A reduction in the amount of attorneys' fees
awards may occur if the attorney did not provide to the school district the appropriate
information in the due process complaint required (see notice of complaint). <P>

<li><b>Discipline. </b> The substitute adds language that clarifies that a child with a
disability is allowed to be moved to an appropriate interim alternative educational
setting for the same amount of time that a child without a disability would be subject to
discipline but for not more than an additional 45 school days if the child carries a
weapon to school or a  school function, possesses or uses illegal drugs or sells or
solicits the sale of medications or illegal drugs at school or a school function, or causes
serious injury while at school or at a school function.  The substitute also adds
language that states that where application of the relevant disciplinary procedures
would result in the expulsion of the child without the receipt of educational services, the
child may be expelled only if the child carries a weapon to school or to a school
function, or possesses or uses illegal drugs or sells or solicits the sale of medications or
illegal drugs while at school or a school function.   <P>

The substitute bill also changes language on asserting the child has a disability after
the provoking incident.  The substitute states that for a child who has not been
determined to be eligible for special education and related services and who has
engaged in behavior that violated any rule or code of conduct of the LEA may assert
any of the protections if the LEA had knowledge that the child had a disability before the
behavior.  An LEA will be deemed to have knowledge if the parent has expressed
concern in writing (unless the parent is illiterate or has a disability that prevents
compliance), the behavior of the child demonstrates the need for such services, the
parent of the child has requested an evaluation, or the teacher or other personnel of the
LEA has expressed concern about the behavior of the child to the director of special
education or to other personnel.  If there is no knowledge that the child has a disability,
the child may be subjected to the same disciplinary measures as others.  If a request is
made for an evaluation it will be done in an expedited manner.  Pending the results of
the evaluation, the child will remain in the educational placement  determined by school
authorities.<P>

The substitute adds language that clarifies that nothing in the language will be
construed to prohibit an agency from reporting a crime committed by a child with a
disability to appropriate authorities or to prevent State law enforcement and judicial
authorities from acting.<P>

Finally the substitute adds definitions of illegal drug, serious injury (an injury that
involves substantial risk of death, extreme physical pain, obvious or protracted
disfigurement, loss of the use of bodily members or organs, broken bones, or significant
endangerment to an individual's emotional health or safety that is the result of a
physical or verbal assault), and weapon.<P>

<li><b>Data Gathering.</b>  The substitute would require each State to provide data
each year to the Secretary on the number of children who received FAPE or early
intervention services, participated in various settings, stopped receiving special
education, and removed to an interim alternative educational setting categorized by
race, ethnicity, gender, and disability.   The substitute bill also requires each State to
determine if significant disproportionality based on race is occurring in the identification
of children as children with disabilities and the placement of such children.  If the State
finds a significant disproportionality, the State must provide for the review and, if
appropriate, revision of the policies, procedures and practices used in identification or
placement.    <P>

<li><b>Part H Responsibility. </b> Language is added to the responsibility provisions in
Part to require a single line of responsibility in a lead agency designated or established
by the Governor for carrying out the resolution of intra- and inter-agency disputes, and
a policy pertaining to the contracting or making of other arrangements with services
providers to provide early intervention services in the State, consistent with the
provisions of this part, including the contents of the application used and the conditions
of the contract or other arrangements. <P>

<li><b>Part H State Application and Assurances.  </b> The substitute adds language to
the State application provisions that requires a designation of a person responsible for
assigning financial responsibility among agencies and requires that prior to the
adoption of the State of any other policy or procedure that there are public hearings,
adequate notice of the hearings and an opportunity for comment by the general public.  
<P>
 
<li><b>Part D Eligibility.  </b> The substitute adds language to Part D that prohibits a
State, SEA, LEA, educational service agency or other public institution or agency from
receiving a grant which relates exclusively to programs for children aged 3-5 unless the
State is eligible to receive a grant under the Preschool program.<P>

<li><b>Higher Education for Students with Disabilities. </b> The substitute adds
"projects to assist IHEs in appropriately serving students with disabilities, including deaf
students" to the list of activities that can be funded under Part D.  <P>

<li><b>Parent Training.  </b> The substitute adds language in the Parent Training
section that allows the Secretary to make additional awards to parent organizations in
each State and allows additional awards to be provided in a manner that ensures that
low-income parents, parents of children with disabilities, and parents with disabilities
have appropriate training and information.</ul><P>

Other actions taken in full committee:<P>

<ul><li> An amendment to prohibit cessation of services for any child under the
discipline provisions was offered by Rep. Scott of Virginia.  It was defeated on a straight
party-line vote by 21 to17.  All Democrats voted for the Scott amendment; all
Republicans voted against it.<P>

<li>An amendment was offered by Rep. Greenwood of Pennsylvania to incorporate the
language on disruptive children developed by the Consensus Group into the bill.  It was
agreed to by all members on a voice vote.<P>

<li>An amendment was offered by Rep. Andrews of New Jersey to return to the formula
for distribution to the states in current law based on relative number of children served
(rather than proposed census distribution).  It was defeated on a roll call vote.<P>

<li> An amendment was offered by Rep. Miller of California to require review by a
hearing officer when there is the possibility of cessation of services.  The amendment
was agreed to by voice vote.</ul><P>

Those Congresspersons who voted against reporting the bill to the full House are:<br>
<ul><dd>Martinez (D-CA)<br>
  <dd>Owens (D-NY)<br>
  <dd>Andrews (D-NJ)<br>
  <dd>Roukema (R-NJ)<br>
  <dd>   Romer (D-IN)</ul><P>
Further information will be forthcoming as analysis continues.<P>

<CENTER><H3><B>"CHAIRMAN'S MARK"<BR>
</CENTER></H3><BR></B> 


<center><b>Substitute Bill Would Include Majority of Coalition's
Recommendations</b></center><P>

As mentioned in a previous message, the mark up of the House's IDEA reauthorization
bill by the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities has been postponed
until next Thursday, May 30, so that the Congressmen could focus on the minimum
wage issue.<P>

As you know, a coalition of education and disability groups have been working on a
variety of proposals to amend the current House bill.  Committee staff have reported
that approximately 95% of the changes recommended by the coalition were accepted,
and Committee Chair Rep. Bill Goodling (R-PA) will reportedly begin the mark up next
week with a substitute bill.<P>

This "Chairman's Mark" would include the following issues.  Keep in mind that this is
still a fluid process, and changes to the "Chairman's Mark" could still be made before
next week's mark up. <P>
<HR>

<center><B>Accepted from Education/Disability Group Proposal </b>
</center><P>

<OL><LI><B> DISCIPLINE--</b>Federalizes the definitions of IDEA's discipline
provisions.  "Weapon" and "drug" definitions are taken from the Federal sentencing
guidelines and the Federal Controlled Substances Act. <p>
The definition of "serious injury" was proposed by the education/disability group and is
much broader than the term it replaced in H.R. 3268, "assault and battery."  "Serious
injury" is defined as "an injury that involves substantial risk of death, extreme physical
pain, obvious or protracted disfigurement, loss of use of body members or organs,
broken bones, or significant endangerment to a person's emotional health or safety,
that is the result of a physical or verbal assault."<P>
     Expressly provides that schools may report a crime committed by a child with a
     disability to the appropriate authorities.  This language, frequently referred to as the
     Chris L. Case language, is also in the 1994's Improving America's Schools Act, but
     has been ignored by the Federal court in Chris L. for IDEA children.<p>
     Adds a constructive knowledge exception to the general rule limiting IDEA
protections  to students previously identified as disabled.<p>
     Provides that educational services may be ceased, consistent with local law, for only
     weapons or drugs cases in the cases where such action is not related to the child's
     disability.  H.R. 3268 currently also includes "assault and battery" in this category. 
     The Education/Disability Group did not come to consensus on this issue.<P>

<li><b>   ATTORNEY'S FEES</b> -- This language keeps the standard for determining
which claims merit fees at current law.  It will prevent fees for IEP meetings, except
where such meetings are ordered by a court in due process.<P>

<LI><B>   MEDIATION</B> -- The language creates "pre-due process" mediation that
would be obligatory for both parties and would not include attorneys for either side. 
Either side may waive such mediation after making a "good faith effort."  Mediation after
this point would be consistent with state law for attorney's fees and attorney
participation.<P>

<li>  <B> IEPs</b> -- Individualized Education Programs will now include either short
term objectives or benchmarks in addition to annual measurable goals.<P>

<li> <B>  STATE-LOCAL ALLOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES</b> -- This language
will require the Governor to establish interagency agreements detailing the
responsibilities for providing and paying for related services in LEAs.<P>

<LI><B>  MODIFICATIONS OF PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS</b> -- This provision
sets additional limits on the modifications which are agreeable to both the education
groups and the disability groups.  These are: in accordance with state law, who are
making annual progress in applicable course work, and for a period not to exceed three
years.<P>

<LI> <B> STATE SET-ASIDE</b> -- The provision returns the allowable percentage of
state-retained funds to 25% but keeps the administrative funds at 3%.  The provision
also will require states to report how the money was spent.<P>

<li><B>   SUPPLEMENTARY AIDS AND SERVICES</b> -- A definition for
supplementary aids and services will be included in H.R. 3268.<P>

<li><B>  ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE</b> -- This provision from
current law is being reinstated.  It prohibits the Secretary from making a grant under the
discretionary programs relating to 3-5 year old children to any agency or institution in a
state which does not have a 619 (preschool) program.</ol><P>

<b>Other Changes</b><P>

<ol><LI><B>PART C SERVICE DELIVERY IMPROVEMENT DEMONSTRATION
PROJECTS</b>  -- This section will allow the Secretary to make grants to up to 3 State
agencies for demonstration projects to develop innovative new mechanisms for
improving the quality of services and controlling the costs of services delivered to
infants and toddlers with disabilities.  This item was not part of the proposal from the
coalition but is being included at the direction of Mr. Goodling.<P>

<LI> <B> COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM OF PERSONNEL DEVELOPMENT
(CSPD)</b>-- The provision inserts a requirement for a comprehensive system of
personnel development similar to that which is in current law.  The management of the
program from the Federal level will be less than current law.<P>

<li><B>  EDUCATIONAL MEDIA ACTIVITIES</b> -- After 1998, this provision limits
captioning and descriptive video to educational, news, and informational materials. 
     Education/Disability Group wanted to maintain current law, which would allow
unlimited captioning.</ol><P>

<B>Recommendations not taken/Items dropped</b><P>

<OL><LI><B>10 LEA PROJECT</b> -- This project would have allowed up to 10 LEAs
or groups of LEAs to request a waiver from specific provisions of Part B from the
Secretary in order to demonstrate new and innovative ways of providing special
education and related services.<P>

<LI><B>   DISCRETIONARY PROGRAMS</b> -- The Education/Disability Group
recommended going back to current law and the 14 separate programs.  The
Administration's bill condensed these programs down into five programs and H.R. 3268
condensed them into three.  The compromise reached with the Democrats provides for
four discretionary programs.<P>

<li> <B>IN-STATE FUNDING FORMULA</b> -- The Group recommended that the
in-state funding formula mirror the federal formula.<P>

<LI> <B> STATE MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT</b> -- The Group recommended that a
provision be included mandating that the States maintain the current level of
expenditure on special education.<P>

<LI> <B> COLLECTIVE BARGAINING</b> -- Language prohibiting anything in this law
from having an impact on collective bargaining agreements.</ol><P>

<HR>

<B>            Amendments to Be Offered at IDEA Markup</b><P>

<ul><LI><b>Republican Amendments:</b><BR>

     Greenwood -- Incorporating Consensus Group's Agreement on Disruptive
Students<BR>

<CENTER><H3><B>IDEA AMENDMENT WOULD LIMIT PART H IN THREE STATES<BR>
</CENTER></H3></B> <P>

Reston, VA -- The House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities will
be marking up (discussing and voting on) IDEA reauthorization tomorrow, May 23. We
have just been informed that the bill will include a provision authored by Committee
Chairman Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania that will significantly weaken Part H (early
intervention) under IDEA. <P>

Specifically, this proposal would allow up to three demonstration states (which must
currently receive over $40 million and have substantial disparities in service levels
within the state) to explore ways to limit publicly funded early intervention services by
conducting demonstration projects on Part H.  This bill was negotiated by Pennsylvania
administration representatives, along with Rep. Goodling.  It just so happens that
Pennsylvania meets the restrictive criteria mentioned above.<P>

The amendment would allow these selected states to be exempt from two very
important mandates under the guise of *improving* "the quality of  services delivered to
infants and toddlers under this part, while controlling costs."  First, it allows the state to
*require* private insurance to pay for services up to $2,500.  Second, it allows the state
to "establish limitations on the duration and frequency of early intervention services,"
regardless of the needs of the child.<P>

Families need their private health insurance to pay for health care.  They should not be
forced to exhaust their annual benefits for a particular service or worry about exceeding
life-time limits in order to access appropriate early intervention services for their child. 
Many families already use their insurance to supplement early intervention services. 
Moreover, the use of existing health insurance coverage for early intervention services
would cause families to incur additional financial burdens due to copayments and
deductibles. <P>

There is no telling what the impact of this amendment could be. One thing is for sure, it
will not be positive!  If passed, it is certain to catch the attention of every state!<P>

Since Mr. Goodling is the Committee chair, the amendment will carry great weight. Only
a strong bipartisan opposition will defeat it.<P>

The Part H Demonstration Project must be defeated!!  Call, e-mail, and fax YOUR
REPRESENTATIVE on the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee
(see list below) and CHAIRMAN GOODLING immediately!!!. They can all be reached
by calling the Capitol Switchboard at 202/224-3121 and asking to be connected to their
office.  In addition, family advocates have set up a toll-free number to the Capitol
Switchboard.  That number is 800/962-3524.  Our message is simple:<P>

<ul><li> Oppose the Part H Demonstration Project proposal<p>

<li> Families of infants and toddlers must not be forced to use their private
insurance<p>

<li> Duration and frequency of services should be determined by the needs of a
child</ul><P>

While you're at it, tell your Representative not to do anything that would weaken IDEA
or hurt children and families.  IDEA is a good law which only needs fine tuning; not
gross overhaul.<P>

Thanks for your help in this critical matter!!!<P>

<B>June 28, 1995</B><P>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>FY 1995 RESCISSIONS</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
     As of June 26th, a compromise on the rescission package had not yet been reached.  While Congress continues deliberations with the White House on reaching a deal in which enough FY 1995 spending will be cut to retain the votes of Republicans and not too much to draw another veto, education advocates hope no deal will be reached that will cut education programs.  CEC applauds President Clinton for his veto of the rescission package that included $4.6 million in cuts to the Javits gifted program, and continues to oppose any cuts in education programs.  <P>
As part of our advocacy efforts on behalf of the Javits gifted program, CEC joined with the National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC) in a letter to every member of Congress.  We will continue to work with NAGC and other education advocates opposing the rescissions.  Please see the attached letter (<B>Attachment 1</B>). <P>
<CENTER><B>FY 1996 FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS FOR EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
     On June 22, the House and Senate agreed to a compromise budget resolution.  The budget resolution sets out a seven year blueprint for the Nation's budget.   As passed, the plan calls for a total of $245 billion in tax cuts, while reducing discretionary spending by $190 billion through program terminations, consolidations, and "returning program management back to the States".   Although discretionary funding will be cut, it is unclear at this point what the final funding level will be for "Function 500", the category that includes education, training, employment and social services.  In contrast, President Clinton has introduced an alternative budget resolution that calls for a $40 billion in increased funding  in education over seven years.  Budget resolutions are passed by both houses, conferenced and the conferenced version must be passed in each house again.  The final budget resolution does not need to be signed by the President; although the 13 appropriations bills that implement the provisions in the budget resolution, do require Presidential signature.   Please see the attached letter to Congress on the FY 1996 budget resolution (<B>Attachment 2</B>). <P>
The FY 1996 appropriations bill for labor, health and human services, and education is scheduled to be marked up in subcommittee on July 10.  The full Committee on Appropriations is expected to follow with its mark up on  July 20.  Because of the overall spending cuts outlined in the budget resolution, the subcommittee is expected to cut appropriations for FY 1996 by $10-12 billion.  This means that education programs can be expected to absorb a cut in funding of at least $4 billion in the next fiscal year!  The next two weeks will be critical in persuading House legislators to retain funding in IDEA special education programs and in the Javits gifted program.  <P>

After final House action, the Senate subcommittee will begin its mark up of the FY 1996 appropriations bill for education programs.    Please see the attached CEC letter thanking President Clinton for calling for an investment in education programs (<B>Attachment 3</B>). <P>
<CENTER><B>REAUTHORIZATION OF IDEA</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
     On May 9th, the House and Senate held a joint hearing to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  The hearing was chaired by Chairman Cunningham (R-CA) and was very well attended.  Testifying were Sen. Paul Simon (D-IL) and Senator James Jeffords (R-VT) as well as advocates, lawyers and parents that were instrumental in the passage of IDEA in 1975.  Included among those testifying was Fred Weintraub, CEC Director of Publications who was head of CEC's Governmental Relations in 1975.  Fred was able to point out the uniqueness of  the individualization of education embodied in the IEP process, and IDEA's ability to get teachers and parents to work together like never before.         <P>
<B>Senate Action.  </B>The Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy also held hearings on May 11th and 16th.  CEC was fortunate to have Matty Rodriguez-Walling and Sharon Gonder, two former Clarissa Hug Teachers of the Year, testify on May 11th.  Both brought regular education teachers with them and testified on how special education teachers can work together with regular education teachers to benefit children with disabilities.   All the teachers did a wonderful job of letting the Senators know what is actually happening in classrooms across the country.   Their realism will no doubt assist the Senators in making positive decisions during the reauthorization of IDEA.  Please contact the CEC Department of Public Policy for a copy of their testimony.<P>
Chairman Frist has introduced a bill to extend the authorization of the discretionary programs under IDEA.  The one year extension will allow for these programs to continue to operate if the reauthorization of IDEA is not passed by October 1.   In future action, the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy is scheduled to hold a hearing on discipline and children with disabilities on July 11.  It is expected the Senate will have a bill to reauthorize IDEA sometime in July.  <P>
<B>House Action</B>.  On June 20, the House held its first hearing on IDEA (during this Congress).  Those testifying included U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley on the first panel and parents of children with disabilities on the second panel.  Secretary Riley spoke of two goals the administration has during the reauthorization of IDEA: focusing on what actually happens in the classroom rather than on the process itself, and allowing for more flexibility to parents and schools.  Within that framework he outlined six principles:  improving teaching and learning, including cutting down on paperwork and having an effective balance on safety and discipline; aligning the IDEA with state and local education improvement efforts; addressing individual needs in the LRE for the student; providing families and teachers with the knowledge and training to support students' learning, including using mediation; having high 
expectations for children with disabilities and access to regular education; and emphasizing early intervention.<P>
During his testimony, Riley stated the Department is looking to expand the so-called Jeffords amendment that amends the stay put provision in IDEA to allow for a 45 day alternative education setting for a child with a disability who brings a gun to school.  According to Riley, the Department will be recommending extending the definition of weapon to include other weapons such as knives.  Please see attached copy of Secretary Riley's testimony (<B>Attachment 4</B>). <P>
In future action, the House has scheduled an IDEA hearing for July 27.  Among those testifying will be CECer Marlise Stieglitz, a special education teacher from Spencerville, Indiana.  The House is expected to introduce a reauthorization bill sometime this summer.  <P>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>REAUTHORIZATION OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
     On June 21, the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources passed S. 143 which would consolidate 91 education and training programs into 1 block grant.  The committee passed the legislation by a 10-6 vote, with Senator Pell (D-RI) the only Democrat voting for the bill.  The bill would authorize $9.1 billion in FY 1996, a decrease in the overall current funding of existing programs.  Of the funds available, 93 percent would be allocated to States in block grants to Governors.  The block grant must designate a minimum of 25 percent to fund workforce employment activities and at least  25 percent for workforce education, including activities currently authorized under the School-to-Work Opportunities Act and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act.  The remaining funds, 50 percent, are to be in a "flex fund" that States could decide to spend in either category.  While coordinating vocational rehabilitation with other provisions in the Act, the bill would keep the funding for vocational rehabilitation separate. <P>
The House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities marked up its version of job training consolidation on May 24.  The Consolidated and Reformed Education, Employment and Rehabilitation (CAREERS) Act, H.R. 1617, would consolidate over 100 federal education and training programs into 4 block grants:  a Youth Workforce Preparation Consolidation Grant, a Vocational Rehabilitation Consolidation Grant, an Adult Training Consolidation Grant, and an Adult Education and Literacy Consolidation Grant.  The bill authorizes $2.3 billion for the Youth Workforce Preparation Consolidation Grant which includes School-to-Work and the Perkins Vocational Education activities.  Of that amount, Governors must allocate 40 percent for serving in-school youth, 40 percent would be allocated for activities for at-risk youth, 10 percent for incentive grants to be used for either category and the remaining 10 percent  to be used for either purpose.<P>
CEC is concerned that any vocational education legislation require access for students with disabilities in all school-based vocational education programs.  Legislation must also include language in the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education and Applied Technology Act that requires recipients of funds to provide the supplementary services needed to students with disabilities to make it possible for them to fully participate in programs.  We will be working with both the House and the Senate to ensure provisions are included in the final legislation that will address these concerns. <P>

<CENTER>1995 CEC CONVENTION!!<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
It was great to see everyone who was able to attend the CEC Convention in Indy!  The PAN meeting provided all with a sense of where we are and where we are going.  PAN Coordinators continue to work on meeting with U.S. Senators and Representatives in their home districts.  PLEASE REMEMBER TO SEND IN YOUR REPORTING SHEETS!<P>
<CENTER>FY 1995 RESCISSIONS<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
Upon returning from their April recess, the House and Senate have turned their attention back to the FY 1995 rescission package.  The House and Senate conferees on H.R. 1158 met on May 2 for a pro forma meeting and will meet again the week of May 8 to try to reach a compromise between their two very different rescission bills.  The rescission bills would go back into the FY 1995 program accounts and cut funding.  The House bill would cut $1.7 billion from education programs and the Senate bill would cut $405 million from education programs.  However, <B>as passed by both the House and the Senate, $4.6 million would be rescinded from the FY 1995 funds for the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act.<P>
</B>We urge all CEC-PAN Coordinators to contact the conferees identified in our alert to communicate our opposition to cuts in any education program and especially in the Javits gifted program.  As the only federal program designed to address the education of gifted and talented children, the Javits program fulfills an important role in meeting the needs of our students.  <P>
CEC has written a letter to the conferees (for a copy call CEC at (703) 264-9498, and refer to the May PAN-O-GRAM).  The conference is expected to be long because of the differences between the two  bills.  Some are speculating whether any agreement will be able to be reached.  We will continue to keep you updated as the rescission package moves forward (or hopefully STOPS!). <P>
<CENTER>REAUTHORIZATION OF IDEA, PART 1<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
Congress is beginning efforts to reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act this year.  On May 9th, there is a kick-off joint House and Senate hearing to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the passage of the Education of all Handicapped Children Act, which later became IDEA.  Expected to testify are those staffers and advocates who helped craft the original legislation.  CEC's own Fred Weintraub, Assistant Executive Director for Publications will be testifying on CEC's role in the initial legislation.<P>
Following the May 9th hearing, the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy will hold an extensive hearing on IDEA on May 11th.  Those testifying will include students with disabilities, parents, and teachers.  We are pleased to have both Matty Rodriguez-Walling and Sharon Gonder, former Clarissa Hug Teachers of the Year testifying on the importance of special education and regular education collaboration, and the need for training and support for teachers.   Another Senate hearing on the reauthorization of  IDEA is scheduled for the 16th of May.  Testifying will be administrators, researchers and others.  The Senate is planning on developing their reauthorization bill in the fall, with passage before Thanksgiving.  In the meantime, they expect to pass an extension bill to ensure programs under IDEA with continue to be authorized after the October 1 deadline.  <P>
The House has not yet scheduled hearings on IDEA other than the joint hearing on May 9th.  House staff  have indicated they plan on having hearings in June, have a bill reported to the full committee by the August recess and hope to pass their bill by October 1.  The House bill is expected to focus on measurable achievements of students receiving services, greater parental involvement, reducing litigation by offering alternative ways to settle disputes, and consolidating discretionary programs.<P>
<CENTER>REAUTHORIZATION OF IDEA, PART 2<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
The Administration has released its second "Vision Paper" outlining their recommendations for the reauthorization of IDEA.  The paper includes recommendations such as:<P>
*     replacing the current eligibility definition with the functional definition "a child who has a physical or mental impairment and who by reason there of requires special education";<BR>
<BR>
*     changing the formula for State Grants to provide funds beyond the FY 1995 level to States on the basis of total number of children in the State;  <BR>
<BR>
*     including children with disabilities in State and district assessments, with few exceptions;<BR>
<BR>
*     amending the IEP to: <P>
     -     include the student's achievement in relation to the general curriculum and include a statement of the services needed to be provided to students with  disabilities in order to attain the annual objectives or participation in the general curriculum;<BR>
<BR>
     -     replace short-term objectives with measurable annual objectives;<BR>
<BR>
     -     amending the IEP to require at least one regular education teacher participate in the IEP meeting; and<BR>
<BR>
     -     require transition planning beginning at age 14.<BR>
<BR>
*     modify regulations governing initial and triennial evaluation to increase focus on instructionally relevant information;<BR>
<BR>
*     allowing school districts to provide special education services in the regular classroom without having to track whether benefits might accrue to non-disabled students as long as certain conditions are met;   and<BR>
<BR>
*     consolidate the 14 discretionary programs into five programs: Research to Practice, Technology Development and Media Services, Parent Training, Professional Development, and State Improvement Activities.<BR>
<BR>
The Administration is expected to submit a legislative proposal in early June.  For a copy of the Vision Paper, call CEC at (703) 264-9498, and refer to the May PAN-O-GRAM.    <P>
<CENTER>OSEP'S QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON THE DISCIPLINE ISSUE<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
The much awaited <I>Questions and Answers on Disciplining Children with Disabilities</I> was released by the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) on April 27.  The paper is meant to clarify what school districts can do to discipline children with disabilities and comply with the protections under IDEA.<P>
The document answers sixteen questions ranging from "What steps should school districts take to address misconduct when it first appears?" to "What immediate steps can school districts take to remove a student with a disability who brings a firearm to school?"  The paper also addresses amendments made to IDEA in the Improving America's Schools Act last year that amends the "stay put" provision to allow students with disabilities to be placed in an interim alternative education setting for up to 45 days if they have brought a firearm to school.  OSERS have interpreted the 45 days to mean 45 <I>calendar </I>days.   For a copy of the document, call CEC at (703) 264-9498, and refer to the May PAN-O-GRAM.<BR>

<B>March 28, 1995<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>EDUCATION RESCISSIONS<BR>
</CENTER></B><BR>
     On March 16, the House passed H.R. 1158 that would rescind $1.7 billion in education funding for FY 1995, and would rescind $4.6 million in the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act, the only federal program that specifically targets the education of gifted students.<P>
     The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up its rescission package bill on March 24, rescinding over $700 million in education programs; unfortunately, the Committee's bill would also rescind $4.6 million in the Javits gifted and talented program.  The bill will go to the Senate floor sometime early this week.    We continue to urge CEC members to contact their Senators and Representatives and urge that funding for the Javits gifted and talented programs be restored when the Senate and House bills are conferenced.  <BR>
  <B><BR>
<CENTER>CHILD NUTRITION BLOCK GRANTS<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
</B>     As part of the overall welfare reform efforts in the House, the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities reported H.R. 999 on March 10. The bill would consolidate 10 federal food and nutrition programs into 2 block grants.  The school-based nutrition block grant would consolidate funding from  school breakfast and lunch programs, low cost milk, part of Child and Adult Care Food programs, and part of the Summer Food program. A family nutrition block grant would consolidate funding for WIC, part of the Child and Adult Care Food program, part of the Summer Food program and Homeless Children Nutrition Program. <P>
     The consolidation will significantly change the way the current school breakfast and lunch programs operate.  The funding for the programs will be combined and will not be allocated on a per meal basis.  Instead, the school-based nutrition block grant will operate as a "capped entitlement."  State allocations will be based upon previous year's participation in first year, and then based on number of meals served compared to other states.  The bill would fund the block grant at $6.7 billion for FY 1996. The block grant will allow a funding increase of 4.5 percent a year for a total of $7.8 billion in FY 2000. Unfortunately, the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the block grant would need to grow at an increase of 5.2 percent to keep pace with the number of children who will qualify for school-based meals. States will only be required to use not less than 80 percent for low-income children.<BR>
     <BR>
     The provisions in H.R. 999 are part of the "Personal Responsibility Act," H.R. 4, which passed the House on March 24.  The Senate will now be taking a look at  the House bill.<P>

<CENTER><B>SSI FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES</B> <BR>
</CENTER><BR>
     Another part of the welfare reform package would drastically change assistance to low-income children with disabilities.  The Personal Responsibility Act, H.R. 4, would change the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program for children.<P>
     Currently, low-income children who are blind or have a severe disability or a chronic illness can receive monthly checks of up to $458, depending on family income.  Almost half of the States provide additional cash to children who qualify.  Most children are also eligible for Medicaid, food stamps, and other social services. A family of four can earn up to $30,168 a year and still be eligible for SSI.  The number of children receiving disability benefits under the SSI program has more than doubled (from 296,298 to 624,000) since the Supreme Court decision in the <I>Sullivan v. Zebley</I> case in February of 1990.  That decision changed the criteria under which children with impairments are evaluated for disability benefit eligibility.  <P>
     The <I>Zebley</I> decision requires the Social Security Administration (SSA) to go beyond previous disability criteria and to assess the child's ability to do things that another child of a similar age can do. The definition of disability for SSI eligibility currently requires that a child have a physical or mental impairment that is expected to last at least one year and substantially reduces the child's ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively when compared with other children of the same age, or is expected to result in death. If a disability cannot be found solely on medical grounds (meeting a listing), the SSA must evaluate how the impairment affects the child's ability to function.  This is called an individualized functional assessment.  If the assessment shows that the child does much less than expected in one area or is moderately restricted in several areas of development or functioning, the child is considered disabled and can be eligible for SSI.  Parents can provide evidence from doctors and teachers to determine eligibility.  This made it possible to go beyond the specific requirements of SSA's listing of impairments.<P>
     Amid calls of fraudulent claims and television programs profiling questionable recipients of SSI, Congress passed legislation last year that established a Commission to look into the SSI program and report to Congress by November of 1995.  Instead of waiting for the Commission's findings, the Republican leadership has crafted legislation that will severely change the program.  The changes in H.R. 4 include:<U><P>
</U>&iuml;     instead of the SSA providing direct benefits to eligible recipients, the bill creates a block grant program to give grants to States that would then provide medical and non-medical services to low-income children with disabilities.  States could choose which services to finance from a list of allowable services;<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     the bill eliminates the Individualized Functional Assessment as a basis for eligibility; <BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     in order to be eligible for services, a child who is currently receiving services would have to have an impairment that meets or equals an impairment specified in the SSA listing of impairments to continue to receive services;<BR>
&iuml;     for new recipients to receive cash benefits, a child with a disability must have an impairment that meets or equals an impairment specified in the SSA listing of impairments, <U>and</U> has a disability so severe that the child is institutionalized or would require institutionalization if the child were not receiving personal assistance required by the impairment.<BR>
<BR>
     According to the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates, there will be 500,000 child recipients of SSI cash benefits in FY 2000 as a result of the above changes to SSI, in contrast to 1.25 million children if SSI was left unchanged.<P>
     CEC is urging Congress to wait for the Congressionally established Commission to report its findings on possible SSI fraud.  Despite media reports of SSI malfeasance, federal reports on the SSI program convey little evidence of fraud.  CEC believes Congress was acting responsibly to establish a Commission to look at the overall program and needs to wait for the results of the investigation before making substantial changes in the SSI program that could result in denying children with disabilities critical benefits.          <U>     <BR>
</U>       <BR>
 <B>PROPOSAL TO CONSOLIDATE DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION AND LABOR<BR>
</B><BR>
     On February 15, Congressmen Steve Gunderson (R-WI) and Bill Goodling (R-PA)introduced a proposal to consolidate the Department of Education, the Department of Labor, and the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC)into one Department of Education and Employment. According to the sponsors, the proposal would save over $21 billion over five years through administrative and program reduction made possible through consolidation.<P>
     The Department would be organized around three basic functions:<P>
*     Workforce Preparation and Policy:  incorporates most education and adult training<BR>
     programs;<P>
*     Civil Rights: incorporates all aspects of enforcement of employment discrimination laws;<BR>
     and<P>
*     Workplace Policy: focuses on safety, employee benefits, and workplace modernization. <P>
     Education functions under the Workforce Preparation and Policy would be organized into three offices: Office of Basic Education, Office of Higher Education, and Office of Workforce Preparation and Life-long Learning. No separate office would be maintained for students with exceptionalities.  No action has been scheduled at any level in either the U.S. House or Senate on restructuring of the current Departments of Education and Labor as this PAN mailing went to press.<BR>
<B><BR>
<CENTER>REAUTHORIZATION OF IDEA<BR>
</CENTER></B><BR>
     The Senate Subcommittee on Disability has released a schedule for the reauthorization of IDEA.  The plan is to immediately introduce a simple one-year extension of IDEA, Parts C through H so that they do not expire on October 1, 1995.  Part B is permanently authorized and will not expire.  In May, the subcommittee will conduct two days of informational hearings on the education of students with disabilities.  There will also be four days of informational briefings for the staff of Members in June.  The briefings will be conducted by interest groups, experts, and federal officials on issues that should be addressed during reauthorization.  In the fall, a bill to reauthorize IDEA will be introduced and the subcommittee will have two days of hearings on the specify bill.  The bill is expected to pass the Senate floor by Thanksgiving recess.<P>
     The House is expected to begin considering the reauthorization in May.  It is unclear at this point whether the House will also pass an extension bill before considering a reauthorization bill.  Stay tuned...<B><BR>
<CENTER> </B><BR>
<B>REGULATORY REFORMS<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
</B>     Included in the <I>Contract With America</I> is proposed legislation that would drastically reform the regulatory process.  The House has acted on two bills that would affect regulations. The House bill, H.R. 450, would impose a regulatory moratorium that would be retroactive to November 25. The Senate has a companion bill, S. 219, that had passed the Governmental Affairs Committee.  The bills would bar federal agencies from proposing or issuing most regulations before December 31 or whenever a comprehensive regulatory overhaul bill is enacted. S. 219 would also be retroactive to November 9 and would only apply to regulations expected to cost $100 million or more.  <P>
     Another regulatory reform bill passed by the House is H.R. 1022, which would require risk assessments and cost benefit analyses before federal regulations are issued. The Senate companion bill, S. 343, is expected to be voted on the Senate floor after the Easter Recess. The regulatory proposals in the bills will make it much more difficult for regulations to be issued. <P>
<CENTER><B>UNFUNDED MANDATE LEGISLATION</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
     The conference version of unfunded mandate legislation passed both the House and Senate earlier this month, and was signed into law by President Clinton on March 22, P.L. 104-4.  <P>
     The law requires a bill or amendment imposing a federal mandate of more than $50 million on a state or local government, or $200 million on the private sector, to include an estimation of the cost and specify the money or taxes to pay for it.  If the bill is to be paid for with a subsequent appropriation, the bill must stipulate that the mandate will expire if it is not funded or will be scaled back if the appropriation is less than anticipated.  Legislation that is brought to the floor and does not include these provisions will be subject to a point of order.  If a point of order is brought against the bill, a majority of Members would have to vote to continue to consider the legislation; otherwise the bill would be sent back to the originating committee.  <BR>
     The law would only affect prospective legislation.  Legislation that is reauthorized will not have to comply with the provisions in the bill, unless funds are reduced for existing mandates, or new mandates are added that will cost a net increase of $50 million on state or local governments, or $200 million on the private sector.  Also included in the bill are provisions that exempt any legislation that "enforces Constitutional rights of individuals; or establishes or enforces any statutory rights that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, national origin, or handicapped or disability status".<P>
<CENTER><B>PAN MEETING AT INDY!</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
     As we mentioned in previous mailings, we'll be holding a PAN meeting during the CEC Convention in Indianapolis.  The date?  <B>April 6, 1995</B>.  The time?  <B>12:30 to 2:00 p.m</B>.  The place?  <B>Grand 3, 2nd floor of the Westin Hotel. </B> <P>
     At the meeting, we'll provide you with any updates on legislation that occurs after you receive this PAN mailing.  And, since everyone should already have completed his or her Congressional Visits, we'd like to discuss the PAN Congressional Visits Campaign, and get your input about whether you thought the Campaign was successful.  If you had trouble arranging your visits, let us know why.  If you thought the Campaign in general wasn't successful, please be ready to discuss some possible reasons -- as well as some possible solutions!<P>
<CENTER><B>SESSION ON THE <I>CEC Special Education Advocacy Handbook</I> AT INDY!</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
<B>REMINDER</B>:  On Saturday, April 8, from 3:45 to 4:45 p.m. in Room 212 of the Convention Center, Jacki Bootel, DPP's Policy Specialist for Field Operations, will be conducting a session to help familiarize you with the new <I>CEC Special Education Advocacy Handbook</I>.  She'll discuss how you can fit the <I>Handbook'</I>s contents into your current training programs, and will give you an opportunity to let her know what other types of training materials you might need in order to more effectively teach CEC members to be more effective advocates!  Join Jacki for this helpful session -- and bring your federation/division officers or any interested members as well!<P>
<CENTER><B>SUMMER PAN COORDINATORS MEETING</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
     We hope you are enjoying a beautiful spring, but it is time to begin focusing on another summer meeting of the CEC-PAN network!  You will once again have the opportunity to experience summer in our Nation's Capital during our <B>PAN WASHINGTON WORKSHOP</B>.  <P>
     We have a number of legislative issues pending in the Congress this year that will affect you, and the students with exceptionalities that we advocate for (e.g., the future of the Javits gifted and talented program, IDEA reauthorization, FY 1995 and 1996 budget issues, rescission bills, unfunded mandates legislation, and welfare reform [including the SSI program]).  As usual, the Workshop will not only provide additional opportunities for training and idea/information exchange, but will also give us yet another opportunity to interact with our lawmakers and public officials on behalf of exceptional children.<BR>
     We have set <B>July 23-25, 1995</B> -- Sunday through Tuesday -- as the dates for the meeting.   Please check your calendars and see if you'll be free during this time.  Please plan to attend the workshop!!  Mark your calendars NOW!!!

<CENTER>HOW ARE YOUR CONGRESSIONAL VISITS GOING?</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
Well, by now, we are sure most of you (and your PAN networks!) have either completed your visits to your new Representatives and Senators, or you're very close to it -- right?!!!  If you haven't started yet, there's still time; but not a lot!  We're hoping that all visits will be completed by the end of this month.  <P>
As you know, now is an especially crucial time to get to know your policymakers.  You, as a constituent, have the strongest pull with your elected officials (isn't it nice to be so powerful?!!).  And, they need to know where you stand on issues affecting students with exceptionalities.  Here in Washington, we're closely monitoring a variety of topics, including a Constitutional amendment that would implement a balanced budget; a bill that would relieve states from the effects of "unfunded mandates;" as well as the President's proposed FY 1996 budget for special education and gifted programs and how it will impact exceptional students.  Information on all of these proposals can be found in this PAN mailing.  You and your network need to be involved in these issues!!  We will provide all the information and the tools you need to actively participate at the state and local levels.  <P>
Please let us know if you're having any trouble arranging your visits.  We'll help you find some alternatives if necessary.  Remember, if you absolutely cannot schedule an appointment with your legislators, it's perfectly fine to meet with their education staff.  Also, <B>don't forget to send us all of your reporting forms! </B>They can provide us with crucial information on what your members of Congress think about special education and related issues.  <P>
Thanks again for your support of this massive education mission.  Please know that we appreciate your efforts, and so will the population of students that we represent and advocate for.<BR>

<CENTER><B>EXECUTIVE BRANCH NEWS<BR>
</CENTER></B><BR>
<B>Administration's FY 1996 Budget Request</B><P>
On February 6, President Clinton released his budget proposal for FY 1996.  The Administration's proposal was sent to Congress and marks the official "kick-off" for the FY 1996 budget year.  In the coming weeks the House and Senate Budget Committees will hammer out their 5-year budget plan and decide the overall funds for budget categories.  Using the total amount of funds allocated, appropriators will then decide the line-by-line funding for education programs. <P>
For the Department of Education, President Clinton has proposed $24 billion for discretionary education program, an increase of $878 million, or 3.8 percent, over FY 1995. The major increases proposed are: Goals 2000 (an increase of $347 million, for a total of $750 million in FY 1996); Title I programs for the disadvantaged (an increase of $302 million for a total of $7 billion in FY 1996); and Title II professional development programs (an increase of $415 million, for a total of $735 million for FY 1996).   <P>
<B>Part B State Grant and Preschool Grant.  </B>For Special Education, Clinton is proposing an overall increase of $89.3 million, a 2.7 percent increase.  The entire increase would be for the Part B State Grant program and/or the Preschool Grant program.  The Administration has not provided a distinct appropriation line for the two grant programs.  Instead the Administration has<BR>
requested an appropriation of $2,772.5 million for both the Part B programs, an increase of 3.3 percent for FY 1996.  President Clinton proposes freezing the Part H program at $315.6 million for FY 1996.  <P>
<B>Special Purposes Funds. </B>(Also known as the IDEA discretionary programs.)<B>  </B>President Clinton proposes collapsing the 14 special purposes programs into 5 main categories and freezing the funds at $240 million for FY 1996.  The five main categories are:<P>
<B>Research and Demonstrations</B> is proposed to receive $63 million. Of the funds available, $41.5 million would be used for the continuation costs of current research projects and related activities; $21.5 million would be available for new <BR>
awards.  <P>
<B>Technical Assistance and Systems Change</B> is requested to receive $50 million for FY 1996 for technical assistance, dissemination, and systems change activities.  Of the $50 million, $36.9 million would be used for continuation costs for current activities.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>Professional Development</B> is proposed to receive an appropriation of $97 million, of which $82.9 million would be used for the continuation of current activities. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Parent Training</B> would receive $14.5 million under the Administration's proposal.  The funds would support at least one center in each State to provide parents with training and information.  Of the funds, $11.1 million would be for the continuation of current activities.<BR>
<BR>
The last broad discretionary program proposed is <B>Technology Development and Support.  </B>The Administration proposes $29.5 million in FY 1996 for a variety of media-related purposes, and for research and development for the application of new technologies.   Of the funds, $18 million would be for the continuation of current activities.<BR>
<BR>
Currently, there is no formal legislative proposal from the Department of Education fleshing out their consolidation proposal.  CEC is concerned that if the Department is moving toward consolidation that it does so with caution and with necessary input from those communities that would be affected.  As you know, CEC has outlined its criteria for any consolidation of education programs in its January 5, 1995 IDEA Recommendations.  <P>
Further, CEC is urging the budget and appropriations leadership in the Congress to work only from the 14 program designations currently in law until such time as the reauthorization of IDEA is completed.  To do otherwise would break with established Congressional rules, and would not allow for thorough consideration of consolidation proposals.  We will continue to keep you informed on this issue.<B><P>
Javits Gifted and Talented Program. </B>The Administration requested $9.5 million for the Javits program for FY 1996, the same level as appropriated in FY 1995. While this appears to be a  freeze on the Javits program, it is actually a cut when inflation is taken into account.  <P>
Unfortunately, many believe the Administration's request to be the "high water" mark for education programs in FY 1996.  CEC, however, will be working hard with CEC-PAN to ensure that Congress surpasses the Administration's funding request for programs for exceptional children.  <P>
<CENTER>-----------------------<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER><B>CONGRESSIONAL ACTION</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
<B>House Budget Update<P>
</B>The House strategically delayed its rescission package until after the President's budget request was released.  The Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, HHS, and Education will be taking up two rescission bills.  The first one will be legislation to cut FY 1995 funds in order to provide supplemental funds for defense.  It is our current understanding that $300 million will need to be cut from the labor, HHS, and education budgets.  The second rescission bill will total a cut of $7 billion, 30 percent of the cut will need to come out of our subcommittee.  It is expected to be voted on on the House floor the week of Feb. 24.  <P>
Although we do not have any formal information, we have been assured that IDEA programs and the Javits gifted and talented program will not be included in either of the House rescission bills.  We will keep you posted as this legislation moves forward. <BR>
<B><BR>
Unfunded Mandate Legislation</B><P>
Unfunded mandate legislation passed the House on January 31 by a vote of 360-74.  Similar legislation passed the Senate last week by a vote of 86-10.  It is now headed for conference where conferees will iron out the minor differences between the two versions.  <P>
The House and Senate bills require a bill or amendment imposing a federal mandate of more than $50 million on a state or local government, or $200 million on the private sector, to include an estimation of the cost and specify the money or taxes to pay for it.  If the bill is to be paid for with a subsequent appropriation, the bill must stipulate that the mandate will expire if it is not funded or will be scaled back if the appropriation is less than anticipated.  Legislation that is brought to the floor and does not include these provisions will be subject to a point of order.  If a point of order is brought against the bill, a majority of Members would have to vote to continue to consider the legislation; otherwise the bill would be sent back to the originating committee.  <BR>
Both bills would only affect prospective legislation.  However, it was initially unclear whether a reauthorization or an amendment to an "old law" would make that law subject to the unfunded mandate provisions.  During debate in the Senate, Senator Glenn (D-OH) successfully sponsored an amendment that clarifies S.1's affect on reauthorizations.  Legislation that is reauthorized will not have to comply with the provisions in the bill, unless funds are reduced for existing mandates, or new mandates are added that will cost a net increase of $50 million on state or local governments, or $200 on the private sector.  The final House bill includes similar language.  <BR>
      <BR>
Also included in both bills are provisions that exempt any legislation that "enforces Constitutional rights of individuals; or establishes or enforces any statutory rights that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, national origin, or handicapped or disability status".<P>
It is CEC's understanding that both the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) will not be affected by this legislation.  The reauthorization of IDEA will not be affected unless any "unfunded federal mandates" are added to the legislation.<P>
<B>Balanced Budget Amendment<P>
</B>Another piece of the Contract With America that is currently moving in Congress is the Balanced Budget Amendment.  The BBA would amend the U.S. Constitution to require the Federal government to balance the budget by 2002.  To make such an amendment to the Constitution, the BBA has to pass the House and Senate by a 2/3rds majority vote and then be ratified by 3/4ths of the States (38).   The House has passed the legislation but it has run into trouble in the Senate.  Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV) is leading the opposition in the Senate by questioning the wisdom of amending the Constitution for this purpose.  <BR>
 <BR>
While requiring a balanced budget, the proposed legislation does not specify the necessary funding cuts that would be required to achieve a balanced budget in 2002.  The bipartisan Congressional Research Service estimates Congress will need to find over $1.2 trillion in savings to balance the budget.  Without the specifics on the Federal programs Congress will cut to achieve a balanced budget, it is difficult for education advocates to support such legislation. The bill would amend the Constitution to enforce a budgetary mechanism but leave the hard choices for later.  <P>
CEC is concerned that programs for children with disabilities and gifted children may be significantly cut if this balanced budget amendment is passed.  With such dramatic cuts necessary to balance the budget, we believe that domestic programs such as education initiatives will face extreme funding cuts.  We also believe that this type of funding constraint will, at the very least, prohibit any significant new investment in education programs.  With the  current federal share of spending for IDEA at 8 percent instead of the promised 40 percent, enactment of the currently proposed balanced budget amendment would make it more difficult, if not impossible, for the federal government to meet its commitment to children with special needs. <P>
Without the specifics on how the necessary funding cuts will be achieved, CEC believes the legislation only gives half the story.  Hard decisions will have to be made in order to balance the budget and the American people should know exactly what will be sacrificed.  While CEC supports the objective of a balanced budget amendment, CEC firmly believes that we cannot afford to cut or eliminate programs that will significantly better the future of our children and the nation. <P>
<B>Committee Lists<P>
</B>Attached are relevant committee lists for both the House and the Senate.  We have included appropriations, budget, and education committee membership.  We hope the lists will be useful for you  throughout the year.  <P>
<B>House Panel Examines Cash Benefits of Children's SSI Program</B><P>
The current system of providing monetary benefits for children determined disabled under the Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI) is completely out of control, and is abused by many families whose children don't really need to be covered, said a member of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources last month.  According to Subcommittee member Rep. Jim McCrery (R-LA) during a January 27 hearing on the SSI issue, the number of children covered by the program has more than tripled since 1989, and without restrictions on how the money awarded is used, many families are taking advantage of the program.  <P>
<B>Background</B>:  The SSI program, which was established in 1974, is administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA).  The program provides the families of children with disabilities with a monthly check; the maximum each child can be awarded each month is $458.  Before 1989, the growth in child beneficiaries had been relatively low.  However, over the last 5 years the number of children receiving SSI benefits has grown from almost 300,000 to almost 900,000. <BR>
According to the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), most of the growth is likely due to concerted outreach efforts as a result of the <I>Zebley</I> decision and subsequent major changes in eligibility criteria for children.  <P>
In the 1990 Supreme Court decision in <I>Sullivan v. Zebley</I>, the Court ruled that SSA had to go beyond its previous disability criteria and assess a child's ability to do things that another child of a similar age can do.  The definition of disability for SSI eligibility requires that a child have a physical or mental impairment expected to last at least 1 year and to substantially reduce the child's ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively when compared with other children of the same age.  If a disability cannot be found solely on medical grounds (meeting a listing), the SSA must evaluate how the impairment affects the child's ability to function, known as an individualized functional assessment (IFA).  If the assessment shows that the child does much less than expected in one area or is moderately restricted in several areas of development or functioning, the child is considered disabled and can be eligible for SSI.  <P>
<B>Charges Against the Program</B>:  The House panel's concern is not focused on those children who are truly disabled, McCrery charged.  He alleges that parents tell their children to "act crazy," so that they could qualify for SSI.  Another of the panel's concerns is that parents don't have to use the money for therapeutic or medical aid.  They can spend it in any way they wish, as long as they can prove that it benefits the child in some way.  This opens the way for purchases of cars, household goods and clothing, even a television set and video games, McCrery stated.  "The key problem (with the SSI program)," added Rep. Gerald Kleczka (D-WI), "is that it fails to adequately state what providing assistance to these children is meant to achieve.  Lacking clear direction, the program often fails to serve a constructive purpose."<P>
The government's lack of program oversight could conceivably allow the families who currently receive SSI payments for their children to continue to receive them during the child's entire life, without adequate follow-up to determine whether the children are still disabled, the panel noted.    <BR>
In an attempt to remedy the situations of fraud and abuse, and to ensure that the "system targets services directly to the needs of qualifying children," the House panel is seriously considering several alternatives to the current system of cash benefits.  Rep. McCrery said he intends to offer an amendment to the Personal Responsibility Act (which was introduced under the Contract with America), which would drastically change the children's SSI program.  <P>
<B>Proposed Changes to the Program</B>.  McCrery's amendment would limit cash benefits only to families who, in the absence of such assistance, would have to institutionalize their child.  The federal funds that now pay for benefits to all other children -- estimated to be about 90 percent -- would be converted into a block grant to the states.  Each state Medicaid agency would design a set of services based on a treatment plan for each SSI child and, in some way, arrange for the family to receive the services.<P>
McCrery's amendment would also change the eligibility standards by eliminating the individualized functional assessment (IFA), which was originally mandated by the <I>Zebley</I> decision.  Children would only be eligible on the basis of the listings.  It is expected that his proposal would make that change applicable to children now receiving SSI benefits who were determined eligible through an IFA.<P>
If SSI changes from an entitlement program to a block grant, it will probably be capped at a reduced level.  In order to stay under the cap, Congress would have to make major changes in the program's eligibility criteria, rules, and benefit levels, such as those outlined in McCrery's proposal.  Other alternatives mentioned include replacing the cash benefits with vouchers, which could be limited in their use to medically related items or services.  The panel has also considered providing assistance only to seriously disabled children (which they did not define); requiring, in most cases, a redetermination of eligibility every 5 years.<P>
<B>The Disability Community Speaks Up</B>.  The disability community, citing a recent SSA report, testified that a majority of the fraud charges are unfounded.  "It is nearly impossible for children to feign disabilities to qualify for benefits," insists the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD).  "The severity of a child's disability must be so fully documented that children with minor physical or behavioral problems cannot qualify for SSI."  The Consortium noted that of the more than 600 random cases that SSA examined, not one case of alleged coaching was found that resulted in a benefit award.<P>
In addition, some have pointed out that the proposal to eliminate cash benefits in lieu of a block grant or service voucher would drastically affect the ability of families to keep their children with disabilities at home.  "Families use cash payments to cover expenses such as medications and physician visits to regulate medications, children's wheelchairs, and family counseling," explained Barbara Otto of the SSI Coalition.  "These are all medical related costs that are not covered by either private or public health insurance.  Some use the benefits to offset their loss of income because a parent must remain unemployed or under-employed to care for a child with disabilities." <P>
Without the financial assistance and the flexibility to use the money, CCD notes, some families could be  forced to surrender custody to guarantee proper care for their children, either through the foster care system or in state institutions at a higher cost to taxpayers.  <P>
<B>CEC Response</B>.  CEC has urged the Subcommittee to wait to make drastic changes to the program until more information about its effectiveness -- and abuses -- are better known.  Congress has established a Commission on the Evaluation of Disability in Childhood, which has been charged with conducting an extensive study on SSI benefits.  The Commission is expected to report its findings by November 1995; therefore, CEC urged Subcommittee Chairman E. Clay Shaw in a letter to wait for the report's findings before beginning any action that may unnecessarily restrict SSI benefits for children with disabilities.<P>
We will update you on this issue as any changes or actions arise.<P>
<B>Key Legislators, Key Contacts</B><P>
Following is a list of very important federal legislators who can have a great deal of impact on programs that affect students with exceptionalities.  We need to make sure that we have a CEC member in each of the legislators' state and/or district who can initiate and maintain access with  the legislators' office.  If that person is not yourself, he or she should be familiar enough with the legislative process to make an impact with the legislator should the need arise.<P>
Rep. Bill Goodling (R-PA)               Rep. Randy "Duke" Cunningham (R-CA)<BR>
Rep. Ernest Jim Istook, Jr. (R-OK)     Rep. Bob Livingston (R-LA)<BR>

TWO ADVOCACY TRAINING SESSIONS HELD DURING CONVENTION</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
In order to supplement the advocacy training you all do in your federations/divisions, CEC's Department of Public Policy will be holding two sessions during the Indianapolis Convention.  The first is our Second Annual Public Policy Workshop, entitled "Making A Difference: Taking Charge of the Political Process."  This all-day workshop, held on Wednesday, April 5 from 8:30 to 4:00, is for any CEC member who is unfamiliar with the political process, but is interested in finding out!  DPP staff and other leaders in the advocacy field will present on topics such as "How a Bill Becomes a Law," an overview of the federal regulatory process, how state legislatures differ from Congress, how to establish coalitions, and how to create or expand your own political action network.<P>
This workshop is not intended for PAN Coordinators, or those who already have a great deal of experience in the political arena.  It is a very basic session -- an "Advocacy 101" if you will! -- and our goal is to help you create a cadre of CEC members who become more active and interested in the political process.  <P>

If you know of anyone in your federation or division who is interested in learning the basics, or just brushing up on their rusty advocacy skills, please let them know about this interactive, informative Workshop!<P>
<CENTER><B>Session on the <I>CEC Special Education Advocacy Handbook</I> at Indy!</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
On Saturday, April 8, from 3:45 to 4:45 p.m., Jacki Bootel, DPP's Policy Specialist for Field Operations, will be conducting a session to help familiarize you with the new <I>CEC Special Education Advocacy Handbook</I>.  She'll discuss how you can fit the <I>Handbook'</I>s contents into your current training programs, and will give you an opportunity to let her know what other types of<BR>
training materials you might need in order to more effectively teach CEC members to be more effective advocates!  Join Jacki for this helpful session -- and bring your federation/division officers or any interested members as well!<P>

<CENTER><B>LEGISLATIVE UPDATE</B><BR>
</CENTER><P>
<B><U>Reauthorization of IDEA</B></U> -- <B>LATE BREAKING NEWS!!</B><P>
Of course, as soon as your faithful DPP staff had finished the last edits on the CAN mailing, we got our hands on the new House draft of the reauthorization of IDEA.  While the new draft maintains most of the House's original proposals, this second draft poses additional and significant changes to IDEA.<P>
<B><U>Under Parts A and B</B></U><P>
*     continues to propose changing the funding formula over a ten-year period from a per-child distribution to one based on population of children aged 3-21 with a poverty factor;<BR>
<BR>
*     adds "neurobiological brain disorder" to the definition of child with a disability;<BR>
<BR>
*     changes from 25 percent to 10 percent the amount of Part B funds a State can use for State activities -- 90 percent of funds must pass through to the LEAs; a similar provision governs funds for preschool grants; <BR>
<BR>
*     eliminates the prohibition barring States from commingling IDEA funds with<BR>
     other funds, and broadens waiver authorization on supplanting funds; <P>
*     removes requirement in Part B for States to have a Comprehensive System of<BR>
     Personnel Development (CSPD);<P>
*     includes an authorization level for Part B State Grants of $2,323,837,000 for FY 1996 and such sums for following years; for Preschool Grants $360,409,000 for FY 1996 and such sums;<BR>
<BR>
*     requires parental consent for an initial evaluation to determine if a child qualifies as a child with a disability; if the parent refuses, the agency can continue to pursue an evaluation by utilizing mediation and due process procedures;<BR>
<BR>
*     changes language regarding parental notices by allowing agencies to send information concerning procedural safeguards in the initial parental notice, IEP meetings, when a parent files a complaint, and when parents ask for it; and<BR>
<BR>
*     changes discipline language to allow a hearing officer -- to the same extent as a court -- to order a change in placement of a child with a disability to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting for not more than 45 days if the child carries a weapon or drugs to school, the child engages in violent acts, or if the maintenance of the current placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others; if the behavior was found not to be an manifestation of the child's disability, the relevant disciplinary procedures applicable to children without disabilities shall be applied.<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Part C (Early Intervention)</B></U><P>
*     includes an authorization of $315,754,000 for Part C (early intervention);<BR>
<BR>
*     changes early intervention grants from 3-year grants to 5-year grants; and<BR>
<BR>
*     eliminates the Federal Interagency Coordinating Council required under Part H<BR>
     of IDEA;<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Part D</B></U><P>
*     continues to consolidate the discretionary programs into 3 main parts: <B>Subpart I</B> --General Provisions and National Activities; <B>Subpart II</B>--State Program<BR>
     Improvement Grants for Children with Disabilities; and <B>Subpart III</B>--Parent<BR>
     Training;   <P>
*     further consolidates authorities under Subpart I by replacing separate sections addressing professional development, technology, media, and research, into a condensed list of activities the Secretary may fund;<BR>
<BR>
*     eliminates provisions on IDEA clearinghouses;<BR>
<BR>
*     reduces provision on indirect costs from 25 percent to not more than 10 percent; <BR>
<BR>
*     authorizes $135.6 million for Subpart I; eliminates funding floor for projects addressing children with serious emotional disturbance and for children with severe disabilities; keeps funding floor for children with deaf-blindness and for addressing postsecondary needs of individuals with deafness;<BR>
<BR>
*     changes language governing required participants for developing the State Improvement Plan, under Subpart II, to make IHEs optional participants;<BR>
<BR>
*     under Subpart II, requires SEAs to make subgrants only to LEAs, who may then award subgrants to any person; does not include an authorization level for Subpart II, promising it will be supplied; and<BR>
<BR>
*     changes the authorization level for Subpart III--Parent Training from $15 million to $13,535,000 for FY 1996 and such sums through 2001.       <BR>
 <BR>

     The Senate has not yet released its draft bill for the reauthorization of IDEA.  The draft is expected to be released by November 15.  Chairman of the Subcommittee on Disability Policy, Senator Frist (R-TN), has stated his intention to keep the current per child allocation formula for the Part B<BR>
State Grant program.  Talks between regular education organizations and the disability community continue on issues surrounding the discipline of children with disabilities and IDEA's procedural safeguards.  <P>
     It seems more and more likely that with the end of the year approaching and Congressional time taken up with serious budget issues, the reauthorization of IDEA will continue through next year.  <BR>
We will be updating our comparison of the different proposals for the reauthorization of IDEA and will make it available as soon as possible.
<B><U>FY 1996 Appropriations, the Saga Continues</B><P>
     </U>When we last left our heroes and heroines,  a continuing resolution (CR) had been passed extending funding authority for education appropriations until November 13.  The Senate has still not passed its version of the FY 1996 appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education.  In order for funding to continue past November 13, one of three things has to happen:  an extension of the current CR, a new CR, or passage and Presidential signature of the FY 1996 appropriations bill.  At this point, a new CR that will fund programs through November 29 or December 5 seems most likely, giving House and Senate appropriators more time to work out FY 1996 appropriations.  House Republicans have promised that the next CR will not be as "kind" as the first one, which prohibited cutting a programs' funding more than 10 % below the FY 1995 level.<BR>
 <BR>
     CEC is continuing its communication to Congress and to the President stressing the need for continued support for special education and gifted education.  We urge CAN coordinators to continue their networks' communication to their Senators and Representatives in their States.  <BR>

<B><U>Reconciliation Bill</B></U>       <U><P>
     </U>As you know, in order to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002 and thus enact a large part of the "Contract with America," Republicans have proposed drastic cuts to federal spending.  To reach this target that was passed in the FY 1996 Budget Resolution, funding can be cut two ways: through individual appropriation bills for discretionary spending, and by cutting spending for entitlement programs.  Savings can also be attained by changing the tax code.  In a nutshell, entitlement programs are programs in which a certain criteria is set out in law and anyone meeting that criteria is guaranteed benefits.  Congress estimates how much will be spent for entitlement programs for budgeting purposes, but the funds will rise or fall depending on how many people have qualified for the program.  Examples of entitlement programs are the Medicare program, Medicaid, and student loan programs.  To achieve savings through entitlement programs Congress must go back into the law and change the criteria for which people qualify or otherwise change the authorizing language to cut estimated spending.  Changing the authorizing language governing entitlements and changing the tax code occurs through the process called "reconciliation."  Congress does not need to enact a reconciliation bill every year or any year, only when changes to entitlement programs and the tax code are desired.  This is such a year.   <U><P>
     </U>The House passed its version of the reconciliation bill on October 26 by a vote of 227-203. The Senate followed suit on the 28th by a vote of 52-47.  The votes were mainly on party lines, with Republicans voting for passage and the Democrats voting against.  CEC opposed passage of the bills and sent letters to both the House and the Senate protesting the changes that would be enacted as a result of the proposed legislation.  Specifically the reconciliation bills include:<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Overall discretionary funding caps that would cut education funding 33 percent over seven years;<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Changes to Medicaid that would block grant funds to States and no longer allow reimbursement for schools for related services to Medicaid eligible children with disabilities;<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Changes to Medicaid that would no longer guarantee Early Periodic Screening and Diagnostic Testing (EPSDT) services for Medicaid eligible children; and<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Further changes to Medicaid that would strip the guarantee of currently eligible people with disabilities of Medicaid coverage (see following Medicaid article for more details).<BR>
<BR>
     Please see the attached letter to Congress (<B>Attachment I</B>).  We will continue to fight against these changes.  President Clinton has announced he will veto the Republican proposals; however, it is expected that after the veto some compromises will be made.  We urge you to be in contact with members on the importance of the proposed changes.<BR>

<B><U>Vocational Education</B></U><P>
     Both the House and the Senate have passed legislation that will consolidate more than 80 job training and education programs, including the Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act.  CEC's main concern with the consolidation of vocational education is the continued access to vocational education by students with disabilities.  The House and Senate versions of the consolidations have crucial differences.  CEC has sent letters to the conferees on the bills expressing our recommendations for the final legislation.  Included in our letter are the following recommendations:<P>
&iuml;     CEC recommends the final legislation keep the current within-State formula for grants that takes into consideration the number of children with individualized education programs being served in the locality;<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     CEC recommends the conferees adopt the House definition of at-risk students that includes students with disabilities.  Throughout the legislation special consideration is made for at-risk students.  We believe children with disabilities should be included in the definition;<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     The Senate bill includes inclusive language that speaks to educating all students and sets up benchmarks to measure the progress of different populations, including students with disabilities.  This language should be retained in any final legislation; and<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     The House bill includes language that would allow localities to fund supplementary services for special populations.  CEC strongly believes this language should be retained.<BR>
<BR>
     The conferees have not yet met to iron out the differences between the two bills  but are expected to do so soon.  We will keep you updated as the legislation moves forward.   Please see the attached letter to the conferees (<B>Attachment II</B>).  <BR>

<B><U>Restrictions on Advocacy Activities for Non-Profit Organizations </B></U><P>
<B>     </B>House Republicans are trying to further restrict lobbying from non-profit organizations.  Representative Istook (R-OK) has successfully attached an amendment to the House Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill that would drastically alter current regulations governing advocacy activities from 501(c)(3) organizations.  Currently, non-profit organizations who receive federal grants are prohibited from using any of the grant money for advocacy activities.  "Advocacy" is narrowly defined as direct lobbying activities.  Rep. Istook, along with Rep. McIntosh (R-IN), would like to change the current prohibition on federal grantees to further restrict nonprofits ability to conduct advocacy activities.  <P>
     Rep. Istook so far has been unsuccessful in getting his amendment to final passage.   The original  "Istook Amendment" would prohibit any organization that receives a federal grant to spend no more than 5 percent of its overall budget on advocacy activities and  greatly widened the definition of advocacy to include such things as the costs of newsletters, if included in the newsletter is a call for political action, has been modified in an attempt to win passage.  The current amendment, which is expected to be voted on separately during the debate on the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government appropriations bill, would impose tight limits on privately-funded advocacy by organizations that get more than one-third of their income from the federal government.  The amendment would also reduce permitted privately-funded advocacy expenditures for all organizations with budgets in excess of $20 million.  The amendment would also keep the widened definition of advocacy.  Also, if Organization (A) received federal grants, fell under the Istook amendment, and  was a member of Organization (B) who conduced advocacy activities, Organization (A) would have to report all of the activities of Organization (B) if Organization (B) spends more than 15 percent of its budget on advocacy.  This provision would stifle associations from forming coalitions to impact legislation by requiring mountains of paperwork.   <P>
     CEC strongly opposes the Istook amendment and is working with a coalition of organizations called "Let America Speak" to ensure that nonprofits are able to continue their advocacy efforts.  CEC believes that the current prohibition against using federal grant money for direct lobbying addresses concerns regarding the use of taxpayer money and should not be used as leverage to silence an organization from communicating its views to Congress.  Interestingly, the amendment does not address federal contractors.<P>
<B>Status</B>:   The original Istook amendment is currently on the House version of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education appropriations bill and will thus be a part of any conference with the Senate bill.  Rep. Istook's modified amendment will be voted on separately when the conference report for the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government appropriations bill is voted on in the House and Senate. In the meantime, Rep. McIntosh has been holding hearings in which he has had nonprofit organizations, such as the YMCA, testify as to their advocacy activities.  CEC will continue to keep you apprised of the progress of this legislation.    <P>

<B><U>English as the Official Language</B><P>
     </U>There have been bills introduced in Congress that would mandate English as the official language of the United States.  Hearings are being held in the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families about the legislation.  H.R. 1005, sponsored by Rep. King (R-NY), Rep. Istook (R-OK), and Rep. Johnson (R-TX), would declare English as the official language, require government publications -- including income tax forms and informational materials -- to be printed only in English, and repeal the Bilingual Education Act.   The bill would also mandate all public ceremonies in which the oath of allegiance is administered to be conducted in English only.  H.R. 739 sponsored by Rep. Roth (R-WI) and 25 other Representatives would also include those provisions, but would additionally require an English language proficiency standard for all applicants for citizenship.<P>
     CEC is very concerned that this legislation would repeal the Bilingual Education Act and thus terminate all federal funding for bilingual education programs.  While we understand the goal of English proficiency, terminating the funding for programs used by schools to teach children English seems to be contradictory.  As always, we will keep you apprised of continuing developments.<P>

<B><U>Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act</B><P>
     </U>On October 26 a House hearing was held on legislation introduced by Representatives Largent (R-OK) and Parker (D-MS) in the House, and Senators Grassely (R-IA), Lott (R-MS), Helms (R-NC), and Cochran (R-MS) in the Senate, that would establish protections for families from "intrusive" government action.  S. 984 and H.R. 1946 would establish the right of parents to direct the upbringing of a child, including: directing or providing for the education of the child; making a health care decision for the child; disciplining the child, including reasonable corporal discipline; and directing or providing for the religious teaching of the child.  The legislation does make an exception for parental decisions that will result in danger or serious physical injury to the child, or behaviors by the parent that constitute abuse or neglect as defined by State law.  The bill prohibits Federal, State, or local government from interfering with or usurping the right of a parent to direct the upbringing of their child.  In order for the government to interfere, the government must be able to demonstrate, by appropriate evidence, that the action is essential to accomplish a compelling governmental interest and that the action is the least restrictive means of accomplishing the compelling interest. <P>
     Proponents of the legislation argue that overly zealous child protection services and schools have usurped the rights of parents in dealing with their children and there is a need to further establish the rights of parents and protect families from intrusive governmental agencies.  Alarmingly, as examples of "intrusive" behavior of governmental agencies, proponents brought up school counseling without the consent of the parent.  Opponents of the legislation, including the National PTA, argue that the legislation is too broad, very vague and will result in a "chilling effect" that will allow more victims of abuse and neglect to go unprotected.  <P>
     CEC strongly supports the rights of parents in raising their children; however, CEC also believes in the rights of children to free, appropriate, and public education.  It is also the right of a child to be raised in a safe and nurturing environment.  The legislation as currently drafted seems to further restrict government agencies from ensuring the safety and well-being of children.  Furthermore, children need to be able to consult with a school counselor unimpeded by a requirement for parental consent.  Children having problems within their families may not feel comfortable asking for such permission before seeking advice and assistance from a school counselor.  We will keep you posted as this legislation moves forward.   <U><BR>

<B>Medicaid</B></U><P>
     Medicaid funding is used by families and schools to provide needed medical services to low- income families, children, and children with disabilities. Currently, if a child is eligible for Medicaid, schools can file for reimbursement for school-based health services.  Some of these services are required by IEPs and would need to be paid for under IDEA funds or locally if not funded by Medicaid.  Chicago Public Schools serve as an example of effective use of Medicaid funds to assist school children.  Last year they billed more than twice as much to Medicaid as they did to IDEA.  Loss of Medicaid funds would devastate Chicago Public Schools and they children they serve.  How will the potential losses hit your school?     <P>
<B>Current Medicaid Law  </B>--  Medicaid is a joint federal/state matching entitlement program that pays for medical services for low-income persons in certain categories, including the aged, families with dependent children, certain pregnant women, children, and individuals with disabilities.  At least 50% of allowable state Medicare costs are reimbursed by the federal government. This federal cost nearly doubled between 1990 and 1994.  Under current law, this spending would be likely to continue increasing rapidly.  A valid criticism of current law is that reimbursement is so complex that some schools don't utilize the resources.  There are stories of districts paying 15-20% of billable reimbursements to consultants to have them set up reimbursement programs.<P>
     Eligibility for Medicaid funding is means-tested based on income and resources.  The standards vary among states.  Current federal law mandates Medicaid to cover certain groups, while states determine from a list of others which populations will be granted eligibility.  States set their own payment methods and rates within federal guidelines.     <P>
     A key provision in current law is the requirement that Medicaid reimburse for Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) services.  States have some discretion in allowable EPSDT expenses, but they have been used for physical exams, immunizations, laboratory tests, vision and hearing screening and services, dental services, and case management.  Neither of the Congressional plans require states to offer EPSDT services.<P>
<B>The Current Status of Medicaid Reform Efforts</B> -- The House and Senate passed their budget reconciliation bills at the end of October (see earlier article on reconciliation).  These vast pieces of legislation will attempt to cut federal spending for FY 1996 through 2002.  As one part of the reconciliation bill, Congress' goal is to limit Medicaid funding growth.  However, the potential positive effects of limiting the growth -- weighed against the potential harm to needy individuals -- has made the Medicaid provisions a prominent part of the budget battle this year. Both the House and Senate bills eliminate the requirement that states offer EPSDT reimbursement.  A conference committee will iron out the differences in the House and Senate bills.<P>
<B>Differences in the bills</B> --  An amendment offered by Senator Chafee (R-RI) restored in the Senate bill language assuring coverage for children under 13, low-income persons with disabilities, and pregnant women.  There has been some concern raised in the disability community that the language in this amendment may not be strong enough to have the effect of fully restoring the entitlement for these groups, but it is a positive step that we hope will be built upon in conference.  Both bills allow states much broader latitude in determining who qualifies and what services will be funded.  President Clinton <BR>
has vowed to veto any bill that eliminates the safety net for children and cuts welfare spending too deeply.  He has vowed to veto either version of the bill as they stand.   <P>
<B>Welfare Reform</B> -- The House has opted to eliminate Federally run welfare programs in favor of six block grants to states, saving an estimated $90 billion over seven years.  The Senate version includes only two block grants, at an estimated savings of $66 billion.  The federal savings in the two bills would be used to reduce the federal deficit and to make up for tax cuts also included in the budget reconciliation bill.   The Senate bill requires states to continue welfare spending at at least 80% of current levels, while the House bill makes no such provision.  While some welfare provisions are currently being negotiated separately, they are expected to be put back into the overall budget reconciliation bill.<P>
<B>The Message -- </B>Many education groups and other service providers hope Congress will get the message that <I>sick kids don't learn</I>.  Although the extent to which Medicaid funding is utilized varies greatly by state and district, services provided by Medicaid assist students in all communities.  In some cases, a school's nurse is funded fully through Medicaid.  In other cases, immunization and screening programs (such as vision and hearing) are funded under the current program.  These types of services would be at great risk under either Congressional plan.   Many Part H (infant and toddler) programs are funded in large part by Medicaid.  They would be in jeopardy if either these bills were to pass as is.<P>
     Although the data are not available to do a state-by-state breakdown of the educational effects of these bills, it is known that a large number of districts receive more Medicaid monies than IDEA monies.  It is estimated that in 1994 New York City schools received over $80 million dollars in Medicaid assistance and that Chicago schools received $40 million.  Given the fiscal and social challenges faced by many urban school districts, the end of federal entitlements for needy children could have a tremendous consequences.  <P>
     A great number of families of children with disabilities or chronic health problems receive Medicaid-funded services at home or in their communities.  These services often make it possible for a child to live at home rather than in a residential facility.  If communities and families lose these services, schools may see a rise in costly residential placements.  This would be counter to all of the efforts to keep families together and to inclusion.      <P>
     If block grants are the future of Medicaid funding (and it looks like this is the case), two provisions have been suggested which could be added after the anticipated veto would be very helpful in saving the safety net for children: <P>
&iuml;     retain entitlements for children<BR>
&iuml;     entitle school districts to file claims directly for block granted money<BR>
<BR>
     Currently, billing for services is so complex that some have reported years of preparation before a district can begin filing claims.  Consequently, the percentages of school districts receiving Medicaid funds vary greatly.  It has been reported that in 1993 only 31% of Pennsylvania districts filed for Medicaid monies, while 90% of South Carolina districts were billing.   Entitlements for children are essential to providing families, schools, and communities with the support they need.  A well-devised direct billing option could greatly simplify the billing process and might result in more districts taking advantage of Medicaid funds.  <P>
<B>Further Complication</B> -- Block grants will result in many constituencies fighting for the same state- controlled dollars.  Advocates for children will be pitted against those who rightly are concerned with the needs of senior citizens, persons with disabilities, and those who are poor.  These bills will literally pit children against their grandparents.  Who will convince state lawmakers to protect children if we can't collectively succeed in saving their safety net on Capital Hill?  <P>
     Cuts directly effecting children include health care, education, supplemental security (SSI), Head Start, food stamps, school lunch and WIC, child care, and more.  An estimated 900,000 children qualify for Medicaid by virtue of their SSI: 150,000-200,000 children will lose SSI eligibility under the plans.  The safeguards of IDEA may help children at school, but without support for their families it has been suggested that some families will not be able to keep their disabled or medically fragile children at home. Institutional placements, which are very expensive and separate families, may be on the increase.       <BR>
<CENTER><B>EXECUTIVE BRANCH UPDATE </B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
<B><U>17th Annual Report to Congress</B></U><P>
     The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) <I>17th Annual Report to Congress on the Implementation of IDEA</I> was released this week.  It contains data regarding all aspects of special education and is available through the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), or contact OSEP at the U.S. Department of Education, 600 Independence Ave., SW, Switzer Building-Third Floor, Washington, DC 20202-2644.  <P>
<B>Summary</B> -- In 1993-94,  5,373,077 children were served under Part B and Chapter 1.  The 4.2% increase from the prior year represents the largest yearly increase in the history of IDEA.   Students with learning disabilities once again account for more than half of students with disabilities.  The fastest growing categories include traumatic brain injuries, autism, and other health impairments (including ADD).  The department reports a decrease in resource room use and an increase of regular classroom placements by almost 10% over the last 5 years (see <B>Attachment III</B>).<P>
     National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS) data indicate that nearly all youth with disabilities had access to vocational education in secondary school.  The American Council on Education reports that 8.8% of entering college freshman in 1991 had disabilities.  This proportion has quadrupled from 2.2% in 1978. <P>
     Look for further reports on this important document in future CAN mailings.<P>

Administration Prints Two Booklets on Budget Effects on Children</B></U><P>
     On October 23, the administration released two documents on the effects on children of the Republican budget and the President's budget. The first, entitled <I>Impact of the Republican Budget Cuts on Children,</I> offers a state-by-state analysis of the effects upon children of the Republicans' budget.  See <B>Attachment IV</B> for the Florida analysis.   The second, <I>A Balanced Budget that Puts Children First</I>, outlines the President's budget (see<B> Attachment V</B>).  Among the many claims made by the administration is that its bill:<P>
&iuml;     "preserves the Medicaid program as a guaranteed safety-net for all children"<BR>
&iuml;     "continues initiatives to reduce infant mortality..."<BR>
&iuml;     "maintains full funding for the Vaccines for Children program"<BR>
&iuml;     "maintains cash benefits for all eligible disabled children"<BR>
&iuml;     "adds 32,000 new Head Start children next year."<BR>
<BR>
     If the President carries out his veto threat, he and Congress will need to come to closer agreement.  We need to inform the White House as well as our members on Capitol Hill that any budget acceptable to the American people will need to be responsive to the needs of children.<P>

<B><U>Million Man March Addresses Education Issues</U> </B><P>
     According to an article in <I>Education Week</I>, educational concerns were frequently raised in the speeches given at the recent Washington march of hundreds of thousands of African American men.  The Reverend Jesse Jackson and Rep. Donald M. Payne (D-N.J.) were among those who mentioned the poor educational showing of black males and called the nation to task for not developing the talent of this huge population.  Federal programs designed to develop talents of the nation's undereducated (from Head Start to the Javits Gifted and Talent Act) have taken a beating in 1995.<P>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>IN THE COURTS</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
<B><U>Pennsylvania</B></U>: Pennsylvania's Eastern District Court has certified that a population of school age students do constitute a class and therefore suit can be filed on behalf of the class against the state department of education.  The claim of the students, parents, and advocacy groups comprising the plaintiffs is that the state has failed to provide adequate services, supplementary aids, and training to personnel.  The class has been identified as all present and future Pennsylvania school age children with disabilities who have not been given the option for FAPE in regular classrooms or who have been placed in regular educational classrooms without the instruction, accommodations, and services needed to succeed.  <P>
<I>Implications</I>: This challenge to Pennsylvania's special education practices could have widespread influence as a precedent. The complaint is common that students are placed in inclusion settings without support services or under the supervision of teachers or staff without sufficient training or support to provide FAPE.   <P>
<CENTER><I>Information</I>: For reports of the court rulings on this case, consult 23 IDELR 61, 22 IDELR 789, and 22 IDELR 702.

<B>Additional Lobbying Tips</B><P>
     All of you have read -- and memorized -- both the 1993 PAN Handbook and the <I>CEC Special Education Advocacy Handbook</I>, right?!!!  Well, here are a few other tips that you might find helpful.  Some of it repeats what's in the <I>Handbook</I>, and some of it may give you a different spin on lobbying techniques.  Either way, we hope you find it helpful.<P>
<B><I>     Note</B></I>: Please refer to the PAN Handbook and/or the <I>Advocacy Handbook</I> for further detail about the following issues.  The information below was adapted from an e-mail received from Terry Roth over the L-HCAP listserv.  <BR>
<CENTER><B>------------------------------</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
     You don't need to have lots of money or a political action committee (PAC) behind you to be an effective lobbyist.  You have other things that your legislator needs, things like:<P>
&iuml;     information<BR>
&iuml;     praise and constructive criticism<BR>
&iuml;     a sense of community sentiment<BR>
&iuml;     identification of special community groups<BR>
&iuml;     votes<BR>
<BR>
<B>WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO LOBBY?</B><P>
     All of us lobby every day when we try to influence other people's decisions.  Some people are paid to try and influence legislative decisions.  But there are lots of others who at one time or another have a need to lobby for or against a bill -- either for themselves, or for the groups they represent.  <P>
     Just as not all of those who lobby are paid, so not all lobbying happens in the Office of Hearing Rooms on Capitol Hill.  It happens in local offices; in people's living rooms; through phone calls, letters, e-mail, faxes, and telegrams; at social events; and at community meetings.<P>
<B>WHAT ARE THE LOBBYING GROUND RULES?</B><P>
     Paid lobbyists and those who spend money on lobbying must follow specific legal requirements (these requirements may change if the Istook Amendment passes -- see "Restrictions on Advocacy Activities for Non-Profit Organizations" on page 7).  The rest of us need to use our knowledge and concern about "our" issues, our common sense, and our courtesy.  Some basic rules to follow are:<P>
&iuml;     Never give bad information.  If you lose your credibility, you lose your power.  If someone asks a question and you don't know the answer, tell them you'll find out and get back to them by a specific time.  (This goes hand-in-hand with "Don't make promises you can't keep.")<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Plan in advance, and be concise.  Legislators are very busy people.  Whenever possible, schedule meetings in advance and be on time.  Plan in advance to: introduce yourself, describe the group (if any) that you're representing and tell how many members there are, explain very clearly what your issue is and why you think he/she should support you, tell exactly what you want her/him to do.  Arrange for a follow-up with the legislator or with a specific staff member.  <BR>

     Leave your name, address, phone number, and any written information that<BR>
     you have on the issue.<P>
&iuml;     Do your homework.  Remember that legislators review thousands of bills each session.  You are more than likely more of an expert on the issue than he/she is.  Make sure you've thought about arguments against your position and are prepared to respond to them.  Learn more about the legislator (her or his profession, business interests, legislative and community committees, voting record on related issues, etc.).<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Develop working relationships with staff members, including secretaries.  Don't make the mistake of ignoring people who can be very helpful.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Be positive.  Confrontations aren't usually useful, except as a last resort.  It's best to find some point of agreement.  If she/he won't support your position entirely, would he/she be willing to go part of the way?  Think through in advance how far you and your group might be willing to compromise and be prepared to give a little.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Get supportive legislators to talk to other legislators for you.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Don't always call just when you need something.  As often as possible, call just to say hello or say thanks.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     If you're doing media work or community meetings, offer to include supportive legislators.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Develop both quantity and quality of contacts.  Some legislators value 100 postcards on the issue.  Others prefer one or two well-written letters.  The key is to generate both.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     GET INVOLVED IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS!!!  As an individual (or if possible, as a group), work for the re-election of your legislative supporters.  If you feel that your interests are unrepresented, get involved in party policy committees and even consider running for office yourself.<BR>
<BR>
<B>WRITING YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS</B><P>
     Depending on timing and the particular issue, telephone calls, e-mails, mailgrams, postcards, and petitions are all appropriate methods of communicating with legislators.  But in general, the most effective way to get your legislator's attention, convince him/her of your concern, and get his/her vote, is through timely, thoughtful, well-written letters.  <P>
     You don't need to be an expert on an issue, either.  Thoughtfully expressing your views as a concerned citizen and constituent can have an impact.  Even a handful of letters can win the support of a Senator or Representative who is wavering on crucial legislation.  Here are a few tips on writing effective letters:<P>

<CENTER><B>How to Address Your Letter</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
The following forms should be used for communicating with State Officials:<P>

For the name and number of your U.S. representatives, call CEC's Department of Public Policy at (703) 264-9498.<P>
<CENTER><B>How to Make Sure Your Letter Counts</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
&iuml;     Write about one issue only.  If you're writing about a specific bill, try to give the bill number or the name the bill is known by (e.g., IDEA Amendments of 1995).<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Write on your own personal stationery, unless you've been asked to write a letter as the spokesperson for your organization.  If you are the spokesperson, write on the organization's letterhead and try to give an approximate number of people in the organization.<BR>

<BR>
&iuml;     Make your letter brief and easy to read.  It should almost never be more than two pages.  One page is best.  Stick to the main points.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Tell your position on the issue and why you hold that position.  Your reasons are very important.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Share your personal experiences.  Tell how the bill or the action will affect you, your relatives, friends, or neighbors.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Ask for the legislator's position on the issue in addition to urging specific action.  Ask for a commitment.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Be as positive as you can.  If you disagree, make constructive suggestions on how the bill or problem can be improved or eliminated.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Write follow-up letters if necessary: to confirm the legislator's position, to ask questions if his/her letter was unclear, etc.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Always write thank-you letters when your legislator has taken the right position or done something you appreciate.<BR>

We are pleased to announce we have a new policy specialist in CEC's Department of Public Policy.  Mr. Jay McIntire joined us in September and will be focusing on the executive branch, as well as providing updates on important court cases around the country.   Many of you may have met Jay at the recent summer CAN Workshop held in Washington, DC.  Jay comes to us from CEC's Department of Professional Advancement (DPA), where he directed CEC's grant in gifted education.  Prior to that, Jay worked as a special education teacher, as well as a local director of special education in Maine.  He will be splitting his time between DPA and DPP until December when he will move full-time to DPP.  Welcome aboard Jay!<P>
<CENTER><B>CONGRESSIONAL ACTION</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
<B><U>Appropriations</B></U><P>
Although the Senate was scheduled to vote on its bill appropriating funds for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education on September 28, Senator Bob Dole (R-KS) pulled the bill after he realized there were not enough votes to end a Democratic filibuster.  Congress will be in recess during the week of October 2nd, with both houses returning on October 10.  We are not sure when -- or <BR>
if -- the Senate will vote on the bill.  <B><I>(NOTE</B></I>: Because of the filibuster, Senator Jeffords did not have the opportunity to offer an amendment to restore education funding.)  <P>
There are several scenarios that could happen over the next few weeks: <B>1)</B> It is possible that the funding for various FY 1996 appropriations bills that have not yet been signed into law, including the Labor/HHS/Ed bill, will be "thrown into one big pot," and then reallocated according to negotiations between Congress and President Clinton.  The compromise then would have to be passed by both houses and signed by the President.  If a reallocation occurs, our message to every member of Congress should be to give additional resources to education programs, including special education, during the negotiation process.  <P>
<B>2)</B>  If, however, the Senate does end up passing the Labor/HHS/Ed appropriations bill as it was passed by the Senate Appropriations Committee, Congress would have to hold a conference to come up with consensus figures.  The Senate bill as currently written would cut education funding overall by over $2 billion for FY 1996.  The bill cuts Title I by almost $700 million, Goals 2000 by $62 million, and Bilingual Education by $34 million.   For special education, the bill would appropriate a total of $3.25 billion, which is $153 million more than was appropriated by the House.  Although the Senate bill would cut $7.4 million overall from the FY 1995 funding level for special education, no support programs were eliminated. <P>
The Senate adopted the House's slight increases in the State and local grant program, Preschool grants, and Early Intervention program, for a total of $3 billion, an increase of $1.12 million for FY 1996.   The bill does, however, cut funding from some of the special purposes programs.  The following would be cut under the Senate bill:  Innovation and Development (-$6.6 million), Technology (-$869,000), Special Studies (-$333,000), Clearinghouses (-$173,000) and RRCs  (-$577,000).   Deaf-Blindness, Serious Emotional Disturbance, Severe Disabilities, Early Childhood Education, Secondary and Transitional Services, Postsecondary Education, Media and Captioning Services, Personnel Development, and Parent Training were frozen at the FY 1995 level under the Senate bill.  The subtotal for the special purposes funds in the Senate bill is $245.45 million for FY 1996.   <P>
The Senate appropriated $3 million for FY 1996 for the Javits gifted program.  This is the same level the House appropriated.  Because both the House and the Senate have proposed the same funding level, the Javits gifted program will probably not be a conference issue.  However, because it is such a small program (and getting smaller!!) it is important to continue to strongly advocate for the need for funding.  As you know, a lot of deals are made in conference and members are looking for funding sources.  See <B>Attachment I</B> for an updated appropriations chart.<BR>
 <BR>
As mentioned above, if the Senate passes its appropriations bill, the House and Senate would have to conference the two bills.  It is of the utmost importance that CEC members continue to contact their Congressional members, especially those who sit on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees.  Our message to the members is the 1) importance of special education special purposes programs for training, research, information and technology, and 2) the need for federal involvement in the research and development of gifted programming.  We must convince members to support the higher Senate funding numbers for special education and not simply split the difference between the two houses.  <P>
We will keep you updated on what happens with the appropriations process.  Stay tuned!!!<P>
<CENTER><B>Continuing Resolution Agreed Upon</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
The start of the fiscal year begins October 1st.  Without appropriations bills enacted by then (see above), there would be no available funding to continue federal programs.  To extend the "deadline" for pushing the appropriations bill through, Congress and the Administration have agreed on a plan, called a Continuing Resolution (CR), that would enable the continuation of funding for programs until November 13.  The CR would take the average of the House and Senate numbers for each individual program, and then subtract 5% from that average.  Programs such as the Part B State grants that received proposed increases, or have the same funding level in the House and Senate, would also be cut 5% from the proposed FY 1996 funding level.  However, no program can be cut more than 10% from the previous year's (FY 1995) funding level.  This floor will also apply to programs that the House voted to terminate, such as the seven support programs that the House targeted for elimination under IDEA.  <B><U><P>

Reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)</B></U><P>
As of early October, neither the House nor the Senate Republicans have introduced a bill to reauthorize IDEA.  The House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities is expected to release a second draft bill for comment before introducing the "real thing."  In the Senate, the Subcommittee on Disability Policy is expected to have a draft ready for circulation the week of October 15.  It is unclear whether the House and the Senate will be able to pass legislation this year or will run out of time.    <P>
<B>House Action.  </B>In addition to the release of a draft for Parts A, B, and C (the old Part H), which was described in the last CAN mailing, the House Committee has released a draft of "Part D" that would consolidate the current 14 special purposes programs into one part.  Part D would be divided into three subparts: State Program Improvement Grants for Children with Disabilities (75 percent of funds would have to be used for professional development); Parent Training, Innovation and Research, Evaluations and Professional Development; and General Provisions.  The draft bill requires the same minimum funding for State improvement grants as the Administration's bill, requiring States to receive at least $400,000 each.  The draft also has the same minimum funding requirements as the Administration's bill for addressing the needs of: children who are deaf-blind ($12.8 million), have a serious emotional disturbance ($4.2 million), or have severe disabilities ($10 million) or deafness ($4 million).   For the Parent Training program, States must receive at least $150,000 or the amount that was allocated the previous year, whichever is greater.  Finally, for research and improvement, the House draft authorizes the Secretary to reserve up to 10 percent of the amount appropriated for the Office of Education Research and Improvement (OERI) to carry out these activities but does not require funding.<P>
CEC has voiced concern over the House Committee draft.  While CEC understands current pressure to consolidate Parts C through G of IDEA, CEC believes the House proposal would not meet the goals or purposes of these critical programs.  The funding of the programs also seems to be in jeopardy in the draft language.  CEC is proposing language that would consolidate the 14 programs into four main authorities: <I>Improving Professional Practice for Children with Disabilities and Their Families; Developing Professionals for Children with Disabilities and Their Families; Informing and Assisting Parents, Consumers, and Professionals; and Improving State and Local Service Systems for Children with Disabilities and Their Families, </I>but would include minimum levels for certain groups served under the current authorities.  For CEC's proposal for the consolidation and for specific positions on the House draft of the new Part D program, please see <B>Attachment II</B>.<P>
<B>Senate Action.  </B>The Senate is moving at a slower pace than the House on the reauthorization.  As we mentioned earlier, the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy has not officially released a draft of its proposal for reauthorization.  The first draft is expected to be released in mid-October.  There is, however, language on the discipline issue that is currently being considered by key members of the Senate.  Please see <B>Attachment III</B> for a summary comparison of the Administration's, the House draft, and the Senate draft language on discipline. <P>
To aid your comparison of the different major legislative proposals, as well as what CEC's positions are on each issue, please see <B>Attachment IV</B>.  This document will continue to be updated as more information becomes available. <BR>

<B><U>Welfare Reform</B></U> <P>
After contentious debates and numerous compromises, the Senate passed its welfare reform bill (S. 1120)  on September 19 by a vote of 87-12.  The final version did not include the Workforce Development Act, a consolidation of over 90 job training and education programs that includes the Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act.  The Act had been briefly attached and could have resulted in funding for vocational education being used to shore up job training in welfare programs.  The education community strongly advocated separating the Workforce Development Act from the larger welfare reform package and was pleased when the provisions were dropped from the bill.  <P>
On the Senate floor, an amendment passed that would increase the funds available for child care.  Also passed was an amendment that would authorize $10 million over five years for demonstration projects that establish community-based learning centers in schools. Unlike the House bill, the Senate bill does not prohibit increased benefits for mothers receiving assistance who have additional children or cash benefits to unwed teenagers.   Provisions on child nutrition and on the SSI program for children with disabilities remained the same (see the last CAN mailing).  The bill will now be conferenced with the House version, which passed in March.    <BR>
<B><BR>
<U>Vocational Education</U><P>
</B>On September 19, the House passed the Consolidated and Reformed Education, Employment, and Rehabilitation Systems Act (CAREERS) by a vote of 345-79.  The bill would consolidate more than 100 programs into block grants for youth workforce development, adult literacy, and dislocated workers.  On the House floor, an amendment by Representative Gene Green (D-TX) to delete the provisions in the bill relating to vocational rehabilitation was successful.  Although one of four separate block grants in the CAREERS consolidation, many in the disability community were concerned about vocational rehabilitation remaining a part of a larger consolidation bill and the changes in the system that were proposed.  The Senate Workforce Development Act continues to have vocational rehabilitation provisions.<P>
Now that the Senate bill, S. 143, has been separated from welfare reform, it is expected to be debated on its own in mid-October.<P>

CEC's Clarissa Hug Teacher of the Year, Brenda Robbins, was in town on September 18 and 19 to meet with key Department of Education officials and Congressional members.  A music therapist from Tallahassee, Florida, Brenda was able to educate and inspire U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley, William Frist, who is Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy, and others, on the needs of children with exceptionalities.  The Department of Public Policy was honored to showcase such a great advocate for children!<BR>

What happens to special education students when a school district runs out of money and closes early?  </B>Last year, all schools in the District of Columbia were closed early due to a fiscal crisis.  Some private providers of services to special education students were notified that the District of Columbia school system would no longer pay tuition or provide transportation after June 9, 1995.  The district argued that, since <U>all</U> district students' school years were being shortened, students with disabilities were receiving equal treatment. The district court ruled that the district's action violated IDEA by making a unilateral change in a child's placement without proper procedural safeguards and by illegally shortening the student's school year without considering the unique needs of the students involved.  The court ruled that (a) once the IEP is developed, the school is required to provide an education that meets the needs of the student as spelled out in the IEP, and (b) the district entered into contracts or other agreements with outside providers and that the district was obligated to pay for those services. The school district was ordered to fund placements and related services until the conclusion of the school year and make full payment within 14 days.  <I>Petties, et al v. District of Columbia, et al: 22 IDELR 853</I><P>
<B>Can a special education student receive a FAPE while on suspension?</B>  The U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Alabama ruled that a school did NOT violate a student's right to FAPE by failing to offer special education services during a short-term suspension (5 days), even though the suspension was due to misconduct related to the child's disability.  The court found that the IEP in place was adequate, that the suspension satisfied the purposes of punishing the student and serving as a notice to other students, and that the school system had a right and obligation to follow its disciplinary code.  <P>
It was ruled that (a) the existing IEP <B>did</B> provide an opportunity for the student to benefit meaningfully from his educational experience, and (b) the out-of-school suspension <B>did not</B> deny the student the opportunity to benefit meaningfully from his public education.  If either of these had not been the case, the defendants may have been found guilty of denying FAPE.  <I>Eric J. v. Huntsville City Board of Education: 22 IDELR 858<BR>

<CENTER><B>IN THE WHITE HOUSE</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
On September 11, President Clinton wrote an open letter to the students of the United States.  In it, he criticizes the "drastic cuts" in education being proposed by "the Congressional majority."  Mr. Clinton claims that his balanced budget plan would achieve the same aim as the Republican plan, but would take more time and would continue the Federal commitment to fund scholarships, student loans, national service, preserve the environment, and provide Medicare.  President Clinton claims that his plan would eliminate both the budget deficit and the education deficit by balancing the Federal budget in seven years while increasing the Federal investment in education by $40 billion over the same period.<P>
<B>Other issues being tracked by DPP</B>:<BR>
The proposed cuts in Medicaid could have profound effects upon children and adults with disabilities.  Look for more on this issue as it develops!<BR>

<B><U>8 Student CAN Coordinators Named!!</B></U><P>
As many of you know, we're trying to get our Student CEC members much more involved in all CEC activities, including grassroots advocacy.  In our ongoing attempts to have a Student CEC CAN Coordinator in each state that there is a student Association (there are currently 30 active Associations), we now have 8 that have agreed to be Student Coordinators!!!  They represent: Texas, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and CCBD.  <P>
We need your help to make sure that all other states (and divisions) with Student Associations identify and establish a Student CEC Coordinator.  If you received a letter from Jacki Bootel during the summer, please follow-up by contacting your state's Association President.  The students are willing and eager to get involved in the political process, if only someone would ask them!!  If you have any questions, contact Jacki at the Department of Public Policy, (703) 264-9437.<P>
<B><U>New Way to Send E-Mail to Congressmen!!!</B></U><P>
We thought that those of you who have access to e-mail over the Internet might find the following service interesting.<P>
This is a notice about a new service that the group Justice for All is providing.  IMPORTANT: Please read the entire message before using this service!!<P>
<CENTER>Justice For All<BR>
justice@tnet.com<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
According to this new disability advocacy group,  "We're pleased to announce a new and improved way to e-mail Senators and Representatives.  Thanks to a generous donor we have expanded our hardware to keep up with the huge volume of messages that this service generates.  It's a wonderful tool for Justice For All subscribers to use to educate Congress on our issues."<P>
<B>CONGRESSIONAL MAILBOT SERVICE</B><BR>
This service is provided to make it easy for you to get your message to all members of the House or Senate that have e-mail addresses.  By sending a single message to the service addressed to HOUSE@MAILBOT.COM and/or SENATE@MAILBOT.COM, your single message will be expanded and resent to all members of those specified houses as if YOU had e-mailed each and every one of them yourself!!<P>
Any e-mail responses to your inquiries will be sent directly back to your own e-mail address.<P>
--> WHERE DO I SEND MY E-MAIL TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN?<BR>
     In order to use this service, you need to address your e-mail to one or both of the<BR>
     addresses listed below.<BR>
FOR MEMBERS OF THE U.S. HOUSE: House@Mailbot.com<BR>
FOR MEMBERS OF THE U.S. SENATE: Senate @Mailbot.com<P>
--> WHO WILL RECEIVE THIS E-MAIL?<BR>
     Your incoming message is sent to all currently known members of Congress that have <BR>
     e-mail addresses.  The Congressional Mailbot System updates its list of members of both<BR>
     houses every 30 days.  At that time, new e-mail addresses are added to the Mailbot<BR>
     Server.<P>
--> WHAT TO INCLUDE IN YOUR MESSAGE?<BR>
     Most members of Congress do not have the staff to deal with replies via both regular mail<BR>
     and e-mail.  Most would prefer to reply to your specific request by way of regular postal<BR>
     mail.  In order for them to do that, you need to include your NAME, ADDRESS, CITY &<BR>
     STATE so that they can send you a response.<P>
--> WHAT NOT TO INCLUDE IN YOUR MESSAGE?<BR>
     Basically, your message should be short and to the point.  It is not wise to include large<BR>
     amounts of text from other sources.  If you want to point out to them about such sources,<BR>
     simply tell them where you saw it.  Imagine getting hundreds of e-mail messages<BR>
     containing the same material over and over!!  The meaning gets lost.  Make your message<BR>
     clear and easy to read.<P>
<B>!WARNING!</B>  Each member of the House or Senate which receives a message from you will result in A LOT OF E-MAIL INTO YOUR MAILBOX!!<P>
If for example, at the time you send your request to the Mailbot, there are 99 members of the specific Body (either the House or Senate) you select that have e-mail addresses, you will get back 99 reply messages from those members when they receive your message.  Currently, the automatic replies are about 750 bytes in size and only contain a header with no message body.  These replies are sent to let you know that the Congress person you sent the message to has received it in their e-mail box.  Some users use systems that only allow so much e-mail per month for free, and then charge for e-mail sent/received after that!!!<P>
IF YOU CANNOT HAVE THIS AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC IN YOUR MAILBOX, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!!<P>
--> WHAT IF I WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE TO A SPECIFIC CONGRESS PERSON?<BR>
     Then,<B> you should not use this service!!</B>  This service is for e-mail intended for ALL<BR>
     members of the House and/or Senate.  Individual messages to specific Congress persons<BR>
     should be sent by other means.<P>
--> LIMITATIONS:<BR>
     This is a very popular tool...Several rules need to be enforced to ensure that this service<BR>
     does not overburden the systems that are connected to it.  The following rules are in<BR>
     place:<P>
&iuml;     The Mailbot will reject any message that is larger than 5,000 bytes in size.  This provides you with a total of 66 lines of 80 columns per line for your message, which is a whole page of information to make your point.<BR>
&iuml;     Please limit usage of the Mailbot to no more than one message per 72-hour period (one each to House and Senate is OK).<BR>
&iuml;     Abusive and obscene messages violate the purpose and spirit of this service and WILL place the originator of such messages on a rejection list. <BR>
<BR>
Users who cannot abide by the above limitations will be placed permanently on a rejection list and all further attempts to use the service will result in that user's messages being rejected by the service.<P>
--> PROBLEMS OR QUESTIONS?     <BR>
     If you have any problems or questions about this service, please direct them to the<BR>
     following e-mail address: Mailbot@Mailbot.com<P>

--> TELL A FRIEND??<BR>
     If you should tell a friend or colleague about this service, PLEASE INCLUDE THIS<BR>
     MESSAGE.  This will save them time in knowing what is permitted and will keep<BR>
     questions about the service down to a minimum.  <P>
The service is provided by: MAILBOT SERVICES OF ARIZONA<BR>

<CENTER>UNFUNDED MANDATE LEGISLATION</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
Welcome to 1995!!  As you've been warned, the Contract with America is moving at a fast pace!  The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act (with a name like that how can you be against it!) contains provisions dealing with unfunded mandates.  Unfunded mandate legislation was scheduled to be marked up in the Senate Committee on Government Affairs and the Committee on the Budget on January 9.  <P>
According to the legislation, a bill or amendment imposing a federal mandate of more than $50 million on a state or local government has to include an estimation of the cost and specify the money or taxes to pay for it.  If the bill is to be paid for with a subsequent appropriation, the bill must stipulate that the mandate will expire if it is not funded or will be scaled back if the appropriation is less than anticipated.  Legislation that is brought to the floor and does not include these provisions will be subject to a point of order.  If a point of order is brought against the bill, a majority of Members would have to vote to continue to consider the legislation.  The bill would affect prospective legislation.  It is unclear, however, whether a reauthorization or an amendment to an "old law" would make that law subject to the unfunded mandate provisions.  The Act currently does make an exception for any legislation that "enforces Constitutional rights of individuals; or establishes or enforces any statutory rights that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, national origin, or handicapped or disability status."  However, we are concerned that with the Heritage Foundation and others calling IDEA an unfunded mandate, programs for children with disabilities could be at risk.  The Americans with Disabilities Act could also be in danger as an unfunded mandate.  The gains we have made for individuals with disabilities could be lost. <P>
We urge you to begin contacting your Senators and Representatives by letters, telegrams and <U>phonecalls</U> to tell them to oppose any unfunded mandate legislation that would affect special education programs under IDEA, or ADA.  There has been a great deal of office-shuffling so dial (202) 224-3121 and ask to speak to your Senator or Representative.  We have heard time and time again that Congress will be listening to <B>their constituents</B>.  Make sure they hear from you!!! <P>
Tell them:<P>
*     Special education is critical to children with disabilities.  It helps children learn and become productive, independent members of society;<BR>
<BR>
*     A penny invested now in the education of a child with a disability, saves dollars later;<BR>
<BR>
*     IDEA is not an unfunded mandate!  The obligation of states to provide education to children with disabilities was established in court cases before IDEA.  States would have to provide special education even without IDEA; and<BR>
<BR>
*     Tell them about a child with a disability who has been helped through special education!<BR>
<BR>
Please let headquarters know of any information you are able to glean from your Representative's or Senator's office.  We will continue to keep you informed as the legislation moves forward.     <P>
<CENTER><B>BUDGET UPDATE<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
</B>As the FY 1996 budget year unfolds, Congress will first be looking at FY 1995 appropriation levels.  The House is scheduled to mark up a rescission bill on January 27; the bill should be on the House floor the first week in February.  The rescission bill will cut already appropriated funds for FY 1995.  It is our understanding that the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education will have to come up with $1.5 billion in savings out of the FY 1995 appropriation levels.  At this time, we have been assured programs for children with exceptionalities will not be included in the rescission package.  Stay tuned...    <P>
<CENTER><B>THE BUDGET BOOKS ARE HERE!!!</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
Over the past few PAN mailings, we've been telling you about the need to be proactive in educating the new members of Congress about the importance of special education and early intervention.  As the information above indicates, it's possible that IDEA and the ADA could be at risk of being considered an "unfunded mandate" (even though they're not!).  We need to let Congress know how critical special education is to children with disabilities.  Our <I>FY 1996 Federal Outlook for Exceptional Children</I> (also fondly known as our Budget Book!!) provides you a wonderful entree to the new Representatives' and Senators' offices.  Congress needs accurate information in order to understand the importance of IDEA -- the CEC Budget Book provides that information.  We have provided you with a list of "talking points" to guide you during your visits <B>(Attachment I).</B><P>
Enclosed with this PAN mailing are enough copies of our FY 96 Budget Book for you -- our esteemed PAN Coordinators -- to hand out to all the new Congresspeople  (including freshmen and sophomores) that are now part of the 104th Congress (185 total).  Please see the attached list <B>(Attachment II)</B> for those elected officials that you should be targeting as part of our massive education effort!<P>
We have also enclosed reporting forms for you to fill out after each of your visits, and return to us in the postage-paid envelopes.  Again, nothing precludes you from visiting any Congressperson in your state, but we need to first focus on the new members.  If you want, you can send anyone in your Network, but please make sure that a reporting form is filled out for each visit made, and <B>returned to us by the end of February</B>.  If for any reason you cannot conduct a visit to any particular Congressperson, please notify us so that we can assist in making alternative arrangements for contact with that individual.  <P>
<CENTER><B>"No Recess" for the House</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
The House Republicans have said they will not recess at all during the first 100 days of Congress (beginning January 4), which may make meeting with your Congressman a bit difficult -- after all, if he or she is stuck here in Washington, how can they make it back to their home districts?!!  But don't worry!  If you can't set up a meeting with your Congressman, it's just as acceptable to meet with his or her top staff people and present our issues.  This is a great opportunity for you and your Network to become familiar with these "staffers," which can be a great help in communicating our issues to their bosses.  Since our congressional representatives cannot be expected to know everything about every issue they encounter, the staffers often know more about our issues than our elected officials do!!  So, don't look upon a meeting with a staffer as a disappointment.  Look on it as a great opportunity to speak to someone who may be extremely knowledgeable and sympathetic to our cause!!!<P>
If you have any questions about the visits, the Budget Book, or anything else concerning this massive education campaign and what we need you to accomplish, please call us in DPP at (703) 264-9498.  Thanks again for all of your help!!<P>

<CENTER><B>COMMITTEE/SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS UPDATE<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
House: </B>The House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities has released the subcommittee assignments for the 104th Congress.  The Subcommittee on Select Education and Civil Rights and the Subcommittee on Human Resources were eliminated, and a new subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations was established.  The Individuals with Disabilites Education Act (IDEA) will be under the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families chaired by Rep. Duke Cunningham (R-CA).  The ranking member of that subcommittee will be Rep. Kildee (D-IL).  <P>
<B>NOTE:</B>  The Democratic Caucus recently passed a rule which states that if a representative is the ranking member of a full committee, he or she cannot be the ranking member of a subcommittee under that full committee.

<CENTER><B>CEC MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS ON IDEA REAUTHORIZATION</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
And finally, if you thought you didn't have enough materials to read, we have included our recommendations on the reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act!!!  The statements include general comments on such issues as funding, diagnostic definitions and categories, and mediation; as well as additional recommendations on professional preparation and standards; and early childhood.<P>
Our latest information on the reauthorization is that Congress will be concentrating first on welfare reform and vocational education, and may not get to IDEA until some time this summer.  We will keep you informed of any further developments concerning the reauthorization.<P>
If you have any questions or comments about our recommendations, please call us at (703) 264-9498.<BR>

<CENTER><B>TALKING POINTS FOR YOUR VISITS</B><BR>
</CENTER><P>
1)     <B>IDEA/Gifted Funding</B> <P>
<BR>
&iuml;     Refer to the funding recommendations chart in the Budget Book; go over some of our recommendations for FY 1996.<BR>
&iuml;     The Congress originally promised that the federal government would contribute 40% of the average per pupil expenditure (APPE) to help the states fulfill their obligation to education children with disabilities; however, the federal government is currently contributing only 8%.  CEC's recommendation to add $1 billion to the current Part B (State and Local Grant Program) allocation, for a total of $3,322.9 million for FY 1996, would raise the federal government's APPE to 11%.<BR>
&iuml;     Currently, the federal government gives states approximately $400 per child receiving special educations services.  However, that amount fails to come near covering special education expenses -- from $7,000-$10,000 per student.  Therefore, states are having to pick up most of the costs of educating students with exceptionalities because of the lack of federal funds.  Without IDEA, even that small amount of $400 could be threatened.<BR>
&iuml;     We need to increase the amount of funding for Part H of IDEA, the Early Intervention Program.  Congress enacted this program after evidence showed the importance of the earliest possible intervention for infants who are developmentally delayed or at risk of becoming so.  Funds invested now in the education of a child with a disability saves a lot of dollars later!<BR>
&iuml;     The Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act is the only federal program designed to address the education of gifted and talented students.  The program places a priority on students who are disadvantaged, limited English proficient, and gifted children who have disabilities.  Under the current funding level, the Education Department can only fund 5% of the proposals it receives.  Therefore, CEC seeks an appropriation of $20 million for FY 1996 (an increase of $10.48 million).<BR>
<P>
2)     <B>IDEA Reauthorization</B><P>
&iuml;     The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is up for reauthorization in 1995.  While Part B is permanently authorized, programs like Early Intervention and Personnel Preparation must be reauthorized this year OR they would not receive further funding.<BR>
&iuml;     Special education is critical to children with disabilities.  It helps them learn and become productive, independent members of society.  When a student with a disability receives an appropriate education, as required by IDEA, that student has a better chance of going on to postsecondary education or entering the work force, and becoming full taxpaying members of society.  Without the special education services provided under IDEA, students would not learn the skills they need to live as independent adults.<BR>
&iuml;     Talk about CEC's recommendations to the Congress to further strengthen services to children with disabilities; especially, reinforce the Parent/Professional Partnership.<BR>
<BR>
3)     <B>Unfunded Mandates</B><BR>
&iuml;     IDEA is not an unfunded mandate!  The obligation of states to provide education to children with disabilities was established in court cases before IDEA.  States would have to provide special education even without IDEA.  Therefore, the federal government is not "mandating" services to children with disabilities.  IDEA was drafted to help states meet the financial burden of meeting their Constitutional responsibilities.<BR>
<BR>
4)     <B>Personal Stories</B><P>
&iuml;     Tell the congressional member about an exceptional child in their district.  Try to bring close to home the beneficial effects that special education can have for children with exceptionalities.<BR>

<B><P>
</B><BR>
February 8, 1996<P>
U.S. Senate <BR>
Washington, D.C.  20515<P>
Dear Senator Gregg:<P>
On  behalf of the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), the largest professional organization of teachers, administrators and parents who are concerned with the education of children with disabilities and/or giftedness,  I am writing to express our strong opposition to the current Continuing Resolution (CR) that if extended through the fiscal year would cut $3.1 billion in education programs--the largest cut in education in history!<B><P>
The bill would cut $40 million in programs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and severely impact critical programs including: professional development, innovation and development, clearinghouses that provide information on the education of children with disabilities, early childhood education, special education technology, the regional resource centers and special studies on the education of children with disabilities. </B><P>
The CR would cut the IDEA professional development program by 25 percent!  With States reporting a shortage of special education teachers of more than 27,000, the need for professional development in special education has never been greater.  Every child with a disability should be educated in a school staffed by capable, well-prepared professionals.  The inclusion of more children with disabilities into the regular classroom places an additional demand on the need for quality training of our classroom teachers.  The cut in funding for the IDEA professional development program is short-sighted and will result in the lack of adequate training for those on the front line of education.<P>
Funding would also be reduced by 25 percent for the Innovation and Development program under IDEA.  This program supports the backbone of research in the education of children with disabilities.  Part E of IDEA provides new knowledge and develops improved approaches and products to better the education of children with disabilities.  As issues regarding the education of students with disabilities shift from access to education to the quality of the education provided, it becomes increasingly imperative that there be a continual investment in research and innovation activities that help teachers improve the quality of the services to children with disabilities.  Research, however, is useless without the dissemination of the information obtained.  That is why IDEA authorizes three clearinghouses to provide current, reliable information to parents, teachers, and others on the education of children with disabilities.   The clearinghouses help translate special education research into an understandable format that can be used by parents and professionals and should be at least funded at the FY 1995 level.<BR>
<B><BR>
</B>The Early Childhood Education program funds outreach projects and research activities to address the special needs of children aged birth through eight that have disabilities.  The Part G technology program funds projects designed to discover technology breakthroughs that will help children with disabilities learn.  The regional resource centers and the special studies program work to conduct large scale national research projects that the regional resource centers can use to assist States in addressing challenges in special education.  All of these small but critical programs are cut 25 percent!   <B><P>
We urge you to support education programs.  With only 2 percent of the federal budget dedicated to education, surely we can afford to at least maintain the federal commitment to the education of our children.  Please restore funding to at least the FY 1995 level for special education programs and all programs that benefit the education of children.<BR>
</B><BR>
Sincerely, <P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
B. Joseph Ballard<BR>
Assistant Executive Director<BR>

Talking Points For Your Visits With Congress</B><P>
<BR>
1)     <B>IDEA/Gifted Funding</B> <P>
<BR>
<li>Refer to the funding recommendations chart in the FY 1996 Federal Outlook for Exceptional Children (available through CEC); go over some of our recommendations for FY 1996.<BR>
<li>The Congress originally promised that the federal government would contribute 40% of the average per pupil expenditure (APPE) to help the states fulfill their obligation to education children with disabilities; however, the federal government is currently contributing only 8%.  CEC's recommendation to add $1 billion to the current Part B (State and Local Grant Program) allocation, for a total of $3,322.9 million for FY 1996, would raise the federal government's APPE to 11%.<BR>

Under the current funding level, the Education Department can only fund 5% of the proposals it receives.  Therefore, CEC seeks an appropriation of $20 million for FY 1996 (an increase of $10.48 million).<BR>
<li>Preschool programs for children with disabilities (IDEA Part B -- Sec. 619) must be funded separately.  Blocking preschool funds together with state grant funds for children and adolescents through age 21 years would likely result in devastating and unacceptable cuts to preschool programs, and would threaten the very existence of preschool services in many states.<BR>
<li>The research training, technical assistance and demonstration program (EEPCD) should be maintained as a discreet, intact program.  This program has been evaluated as one of the best examples of research-to-practice in the federal government.  It provides innovative practices which feed the field with more effective ways of serving infants, toddlers, and preschoolers with special needs and their families.  The consolidation of this program together with other programs is likely to result in a substantial decreased emphasis on very young children and their families.<BR>
<li>The President's proposed consolidations into five programs of the current 14 IDEA support programs should be considered only within the context of regular IDEA reauthorization, and should not provide a basis for budget and appropriations action before reauthorization has occurred.<P>
2)     <B>IDEA Reauthorization</B><P>
<li>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is up for reauthorization in 1995.  While Part B is permanently authorized, programs like Early Intervention and Personnel Preparation must be reauthorized this year OR they would not receive further funding.<BR>

States would have to provide special education even without IDEA.  Therefore, the federal government is not "mandating" services to children with disabilities.  IDEA was drafted to help states meet the financial burden of meeting their Constitutional responsibilities.<P>
4)     <B>Personal Stories</B><P>

House Panel Examines Cash Benefits of Children's SSI Program</B><P>
The current system of providing monetary benefits for children determined disabled under the Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI) is completely out of control, and is abused by many families whose children don't really need to be covered, said a member of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources last month.  According to Subcommittee member Rep. Jim McCrery (R-LA) during a January 27 hearing on the SSI issue, the number of children covered by the program has more than tripled since 1989, and without restrictions on how the money awarded is used, many families are taking advantage of the program.  <P>
<B>Background</B>:  The SSI program, which was established in 1974, is administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA).  The program provides the families of children with disabilities with a monthly check; the maximum each child can be awarded each month is $458.  Before 1989, the growth in child beneficiaries had been relatively low.  However, over the last 5 years the number of children receiving SSI benefits has grown from almost 300,000 to almost 900,000.   According to the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), most of the growth is likely due to concerted outreach efforts as a result of the <I>Zebley</I> decision and subsequent major changes in eligibility criteria for children.  <P>
In the 1990 Supreme Court decision in <I>Sullivan v. Zebley</I>, the Court ruled that SSA had to go beyond its previous disability criteria and assess a child's ability to do things that another child of a similar age can do.  The definition of disability for SSI eligibility requires that a child have a physical or mental impairment expected to last at least 1 year and to substantially reduce the child's ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively when compared with other children of the same age.  If a disability cannot be found solely on medical grounds (meeting a listing), the SSA must evaluate how the impairment affects the child's ability to function, known as an individualized functional assessment (IFA).  If the assessment shows that the child does much less than expected in one area or is moderately restricted in several areas of development or functioning, the child is considered disabled and can be eligible for SSI.  <P>
<B>Charges Against the Program</B>:  The House panel's concern is not focused on those children who are truly disabled, McCrery charged.  He alleges that parents tell their children to "act crazy," so that they could qualify for SSI.  Another of the panel's concerns is that parents don't have to use the money for therapeutic or medical aid.  They can spend it in any way they wish, as long as they can prove that it benefits the child in some way.  This opens the way for purchases of cars, household goods and clothing, even a television set and video games, McCrery stated.  "The key problem (with the SSI program)," added Rep. Gerald Kleczka (D-WI), "is that it fails to adequately state what providing assistance to these children is meant to achieve.  Lacking clear direction, the program often fails to serve a constructive purpose."<P>
The government's lack of program oversight could conceivably allow the families who currently receive SSI payments for their children to continue to receive them during the child's entire life, without adequate follow-up to determine whether the children are still disabled, the panel noted.   In an attempt to remedy the situations of fraud and abuse, and to ensure that the "system targets services directly to the needs of qualifying children," the House panel is seriously considering several alternatives to the current system of cash benefits.  <P>
<B>Proposed Changes to the Program</B>.  On February 15, the Subcommittee completed its work on the Republican welfare reform proposal, the Personal Responsibility Act.  The full Ways and Means Committee passed the measure in early March.  Under Title IV of the Act, the Committee approved the following major changes to the children's SSI program:  <P>
&#128;The Individualized Functional Assessment (IFA) would be eliminated for children who do not meet the medical "listings," essentially overturning the effects of the <I>Zebley</I> decision.<BR>
&#128;Cash benefits for future recipients would be eliminated, except for those individuals who meet the listings and who, without the cash payment, would have to be institutionalized.  Those children who are found eligible under the listings but are not eligible for cash benefits will qualify for services through a block grant to the states.<BR>
&#128;For children who currently receive cash benefits, if they qualified on the basis of the medical listings, they will continue to receive cash benefits (grandfathering).  However, if they qualified on the basis of the IFA, they will lose eligibility and cash benefits six months after the law is enacted.<BR>
&#128;States would receive a block grant from the Social Security Administration, which could be spent only on authorized medical and non-medical services.  States would decide who to serve and which services to provide from a prescribed list.  The states would receive funds based on a formula which essentially allocates an amount equal to only 75 % of the average SSI benefit for each child who does not receive cash.  The funds are intended to cover additional services to children who are eligible for cash benefits (grandfathered or otherwise would be institutionalized) and those who are disabled by a condition in the medical listings but who are not receiving cash (newly eligible).  Children would continue to be eligible for Medicaid in those states which automatically cover SSI-eligible children.<P>
<B>The Disability Community Speaks Up</B>.  The disability community, citing a recent SSA report, testified that a majority of the fraud charges are unfounded.  "It is nearly impossible for children to feign disabilities to qualify for benefits," insists the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD).  "The severity of a child's disability must be so fully documented that children with minor physical or behavioral problems cannot qualify for SSI."  The Consortium noted that of the more than 600 random cases that SSA examined, not one case of alleged coaching was found that resulted in a benefit award.<P>
In addition, some have pointed out that the proposal to eliminate cash benefits in lieu of a block grant or service voucher would drastically affect the ability of families to keep their children with disabilities at home.  "Families use cash payments to cover expenses such as medications and physician visits to regulate medications, children's wheelchairs, and family counseling," explained Barbara Otto of the SSI Coalition.  "These are all medical related costs that are not covered by either private or public health insurance.  Some use the benefits to offset their loss of income because a parent must remain unemployed or under-employed to care for a child with disabilities." <P>
Without the financial assistance and the flexibility to use the money, CCD notes, some families could be  forced to surrender custody to guarantee proper care for their children, either through the foster care system or in state institutions at a higher cost to taxpayers.  <P>
<B>CEC Response</B>.  CEC has urged the Subcommittee to wait to make drastic changes to the program until more information about its effectiveness -- and abuses -- are better known.  Congress has established a Commission on the Evaluation of Disability in Childhood, which has been charged with conducting an extensive study on SSI benefits.  The Commission is expected to report its findings by August 1995; therefore, CEC urged Subcommittee Chairman E. Clay Shaw in a letter to wait for the report's findings before beginning any action that may unnecessarily restrict SSI benefits for children with disabilities.<P>

<B>SCHOOL-TO-WORK OPPORTUNITIES ACT<P>
</B>On May 4th, President Clinton signed the School-to-Work Opportunities Act into law.  The law authorizes $300 million for FY 1995 to develop and establish school-to-work transition programs.  CEC played an integral role in crafting the law by promoting recommendations that were eventually incorporated into the final legislation.  CEC's main concern centered on the inclusion of children with exceptionalities in the school-to-work transition programs.  It was critical to ensure programs were designed in such a way to provide the support and accommodations necessary for children with disabilities to fully participate.  <P>
Following is a brief summary of provisions in the law that will encourage the participation of students with disabilities:<B><P>
Definition of All Students.  </B>Similar to Goals 2000, the law defines the term "all students" to include students with disabilities and academically talented students.  Throughout the legislation, the term all students is used to ensure programs are designed in such a way to ensure the opportunity to participate is extended to the entire student population. <B> <P>
School Site Mentor. </B> The transition programs will provide each student with a school site mentor to act as a liaison among the student and the employer, school, teacher, school administrator, and parent of the student.  The school site mentor will work in consultation with both teachers and related services personnel.<B>  </B><P>
<B>Work Experience.  </B>The House version of the bill required <B>paid</B> work experience to be apart of any transition program, while the Senate just required work experience.  Many believed that by requiring paid work experience, job opportunities would be limited.  The final legislation does not require paid work experience.      <B> </B><P>
<B>Career Awareness and Exploration.  </B>Every transition program must provide career awareness and career exploration and counseling.  The Senate required these services to begin prior to the 11th grade.  The House began these services much earlier, requiring the services begin no later than the middle school grades.  CEC strenuously advocated the need to begin early.  The law now calls for services to begin no later than 7th grade.<P>
<B>State Programs.  </B>For a State to receive a development grant, the State is required to describe in its State Development Plan how it will provide opportunities for students with disabilities and academically talented students in the school-to-work programs.  For an implementation grant, a State must submit a State Implementation Plan that describes how the State will ensure "effective and meaningful opportunities" (language taken from the ADA) for all students to participate in programs.  <P>
A State is also required in both the State Development Plan and in the State Implementation Plan to describe the manner in which the State has obtained and will continue to obtain the participation of teachers and related services personnel in the planning and development of the transition program.  States must also describe the State's strategy for providing training to  teachers and related services personnel.         <P>
<B>Graduation Assistance.  </B>With the funds provided to States through implementation grants, States will provide subgrants to local partnerships.  Local partnerships may use the funds for a variety of school-to-work activities including a graduation assistance program to assist at-risk students, low achieving students and students with disabilities in graduating from high school, enrolling in postsecondary education, and finding or advancing in jobs.<P>
<B>Professional Development.  </B>Local partnerships are authorized to design local strategies to provide adequate planning time and staff development activities for teachers, school counselors and related services personnel for the implementation of school-to- work programs.<P>
<B>Assessments of Programs.  </B>The Secretaries of Education and Labor will make grants to establish a system of performance measures for assessing State and local programs on a range of issues including the outcomes of participating students and school dropouts, by gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, LEP, and the disability of the participants and whether the participants are academically talented students.

FY 1996 Reconciliation Bill <P>
Reston, VA -- October 26, 1995 -- The FY 1996 reconciliation bill is now on the floor of both the House and the Senate.  The bill is the legislative implementation of the Republicans' goal to balance the budget by the year 2002.  It contains a variety of other pieces of legislation, including changes in taxes [the bill provides for $245 billion in tax cuts], spending caps for discretionary spending -- including education -- cuts in student loans, and changes in<BR>
Medicare and Medicaid. <P>
Following is a letter CEC sent to various members of the House, describing the disastrous effects the reconciliation bill would have on the provision of services for children and youth with disabilities.<P>
Please call your Representatives and Senators and urge them to oppose this reconciliation bill.  You can use the information in the letter as talking points to support our position.  Also, please contact the White House at (202) 456-1414 and urge President Clinton to not compromise on this issue, and fulfill his promise to veto the legislation. <BR>
Thanks for your help!!!<P>
                    -------------------------<P>
October 18, 1995<P>
U.S. House of Representatives<BR>
Washington, D.C. 20515<P>
Dear Representative:<P>
On behalf of the 54,000 members of the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), an organization of teachers, administrators, parents and others concerned with the education of children with disabilities and the gifted, we urge you to oppose the FY96 reconciliation bill.  The bill would cut education programs, eliminate Medicaid provisions allowing schools to be reimbursed for costs associated with the education of children with disabilities, and eliminate<BR>
currently required Medicaid Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment Program services.  <P>
<B>Cuts in Funding for Education Programs</B>.  The FY96 reconciliation bill would cut education programs and impose discretionary program funding caps that would cut education an estimated 33 percent over the next seven years.  Our nation needs a well-educated populace to carry us into the next century.  Rolling back the federal commitment to our children is shortsighted and will result in students less prepared to enter the workforce and financially unable to enter postsecondary institutions, and will result in less research and development being conducted that will generate better ways to educate our young.  Special education serves over 5 million children.  The Federal government has promised to pay 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure to assist with the costs of providing education services to children with disabilities.  Currently, the Federal government is contributing a mere 8 percent. CEC urges the Congress to strongly reject further cuts in education and support an increased<BR>
investment in our children.  <P>
<B>Elimination of Medicaid Provisions Allowing Reimbursements for Schools</B>.  Schools provide a wide range of services to children with disabilities in order to further educate and prepare them for life after school.  Going on to further education, having a job, living independently, and getting along in the community are all goals of children with disabilities and the teachers that teach them the necessary skills.  Currently, if a child is eligible for Medicaid services, schools are allowed to seek reimbursement for school-based health services they provide.  To financially strapped schools, these Medicaid reimbursements allow school funds to be stretched for other services and purposes.  Under the FY96 reconciliation bill the provisions allowing schools to seek reimbursement would be eliminated.  CEC asks Congress to support schools and reject the elimination of these provisions!<P>
<B>Elimination of Medicaid Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment Services</B>.   Currently, Medicaid requires States to provide Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) services.  These comprehensive services ensure that low-income children receive physical exams, appropriate immunizations, laboratory tests, vision tests, dental services and hearing services.  These services are critical for identifying children with disabilities and promoting early intervention.  The IDEA Part H early intervention program is also able to receive Medicaid reimbursement for the services provided to eligible infants and toddlers.  The earlier an infant is identified as having a disability the earlier we can provide necessary services and prepare the child for school!  Early intervention is the key to lessening the lifelong impact of a disability on a child.   Because the reconciliation bill would eliminate these services, we urge Congress to oppose the elimination of EPSDT and ensure low-income children EPSDT services in any Medicaid legislation.      <P>
For all of these stated reasons, the Council for Exceptional Children opposes the FY96 reconciliation bill and urges you to vote "no" on final passage.   Please do not hesitate to contact CEC for additional information.<P>
Sincerely,<P>
<BR>

<BR>
October 4, 1995<P>
<BR>
Ms. Krisann Pearce<BR>
Committee on Labor and Human Resources<BR>
Washington, D.C.  20510<P>
Dear Ms. Pearce: <P>
Thank you for your inquiry on the Individual Education Program (IEP) in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  The reauthorization of IDEA is an opportunity to increase our commitment to provide quality educational services to children with disabilities by well-trained professionals.  We hope that by the end of the reauthorization children, parents, teachers and others will agree that we have legislation that further meets the twin goals of providing a free, appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment for all children with special needs.<P>
As you are well aware, the IEP is a critical component in providing children with disabilities with individually tailored educational services.  It is an important document for various reasons: it embodies the school's commitment to educating a child with a disability consistent with his or her needs, it symbolizes the partnership between the parents and schools, the IEP assists teachers in measuring the progress of the child throughout the year, and it acts as a written agreement among parents, teachers and others on the best course of action in the education of a particular child. The IEP is meant to be developed with the parents of the child and to promote dialog between the school and family.   <P>
CEC fully supports the revolutionary concept and goals of the IEP and worked vigorously for inclusion of the IEP in P.L. 94-142.  As written in statute however, there have been unexpected consequences to the IEP.  Special education teachers have noted the increasing amount of time they are having to devote to "paperwork", time taken from teaching and preparation.  Furthermore, with more inclusive placements, special education teachers report they need additional time to jointly plan, consult and collaborate with regular education teachers.   CEC has urged Congress to eliminate the "short-term objectives" currently required in the IEP that were causing unnecessary documentation of lesson planning.   We are pleased that S. 1075 and the House draft bill would eliminate this requirement.  We have been very concerned, however, that both the Administration's bill and the House draft bill would expand existing requirements in the content of the IEP and add new components.  Both bills would also add factors that should be considered in the development of the IEP.  <P>
CEC is also very concerned with language in S. 1075 that would require justifications for any other placement other than the regular classroom.  There is also added IEP requirements throughout S. 1075 and the House draft that suggest that only the general education curriculum can challenge students to meet high standards.  While CEC wholeheartedly supports the regular classroom and the general education curriculum for the many children with disabilities for whom it is appropriate, there are also children with disabilities who benefit from other settings and life skills curriculums.  Indeed, there is already strong language in IDEA that requires the education of a child with a disability to occur with his or her nondisabled peers unless the nature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.<P>
We urge the Senate to respect the continuum of placements of children with special needs in the least restrictive environment in which they can receive an appropriate education.  The additional requirements in S. 1075 and the House draft unnecessarily require justifications and explanations for other types of placements and curriculums and should be eliminated.  While the goals of the additional language supports the need for greater inclusion, the additional burden of this documentation will result in less time for the critical collaboration, consultation, and
planning between special education and regular education teachers that research shows makes inclusive placements work.        <P>
We urge the Senate to return to the content required currently in an IEP with three main changes:<P>
1)<B>Eliminate the Requirement for Short Term Objectives</B>.  CEC believes that by eliminating this requirement there will be a significant increase in the time educators have to teach by reducing labor
intensive paperwork.  The IEP should focus on the annual goals (written in measurable terms) and a clear articulation on what the special education and related services will be to achieve those goals.<P>
2)<B>Specify the Extent of Student Participation in National and State-wide Assessments.</B>       Many children with disabilities have been uniformly excluded from participating in the various national and state-wide<BR>
<DL><DD>assessments administered to their non-disabled classmates.  As a result of these exclusions, assessment result are skewed and children with disabilities are not held to the same high standards and expectations as their peers.  Thus, CEC believes the past exclusion from assessments, warrants a new IEP component that would require a statement describing the extent of student participation in national and state-wide assessments and the accommodations and/or modifications needed for such participation.</DL><BR>
3)<B>The Age in Which Transition Planning Should Begin Should be Changed from 16 to 14.  </B>Currently, a transition plan must be developed by the IEP team by the time a student is 16, or when determined appropriate for the individual, beginning at age 14 or younger.  The majority of IEP teams, however, do not approach the subject of a student's transition from school into his or her adult life until the team is required to at age 16.  Unfortunately, many students with disabilities drop out of school before they reach 16 and do not have transition plans.  Lowering the age for mandated transition planning will increase our ability to keep students with disabilities in school by providing students with an opportunity to understand that they are learning skills that will lead to a job, to further education and to living independently. <P>
We believe that other factors including the transfer of rights at the age of majority, braille literacy, and behavior management plans may be factors that need to be considered in the development of the IEP but not required to be apart of every child's IEP.  We also believe that in developing any IEP the IEP team should consider the child's strengths, parental concerns and the results of the initial evaluation or most recent reevaluation.  <P>
Thank you again for providing CEC with an opportunity to express our support for the IEP process and our recommended changes.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further assistance.<P>
<BR>
Sincerely,<P>
<BR>
<BR>

Assistant Executive Director<BR>

</center>
<B><CENTER> SUMMARY OF ADMINISTRATION, HOUSE, AND SENATE IDEA PROVISIONS ON MAJOR ISSUES WITH CEC POSITION</B><BR>
</CENTER><P>
<U>Provisions</U>
<U>Various Positions</U>
Federal Commitment
<B>Administration's bill:</B> The Administration's bill would eliminate provisions in the current IDEA that entitles States to funds equal to 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure (APPE) for every child served under IDEA.  The funds are to help States meet the excess costs of educating a child with a disability.<P>
<B>House draft bill:</B> The House draft bill would also eliminate these provisions.<P>
<B>Senate draft bill:</B> The Senate retains the current IDEA language.<P>
<B>CEC position</B>: Although the current Federal funds to States equals only 8 percent of the APPE, CEC strongly supports retaining the original 40 percent commitment encased in IDEA.  IDEA is meant to be a partnership between the Federal government and the States to educate children with disabilities.  This commitment to the States must continue.   
State Formula
<B>Administration's bill</B>: H.R. 1986 would ensure States receive an amount equal to the amount it received under FY 1995; for funds appropriated above the FY 1996 level, the current formula would change from one based on the number of children with disabilities served to a formula based on the population of children aged 3 through 21.   <P>
<B>House draft bill:</B> The House has released a draft bill that would institute a 10
year transition from a "head count" to a population-based formula (aged 3-21) with a factor for child poverty.<P>
<B>Senate draft bill</B>: The Senate draft bill would keep the current child count formula for grants to States.<P>
<B>CEC position</B>: CEC supports the current child count formula and opposes moving toward a population-based formula at this time.<BR>

Local Formula
<B>Administration's bill:</B> H.R. 1986 would change current law that requires States to make grants to LEAs based on the number of children with disabilities they serve, to allow States to make grants based on population, school enrollment, population of children receiving FAPE, allocations for previous fiscal years, any two or more of the previous factors, or poverty in combination with one or more of the other factors.<P>
<B>House draft bill</B>: Same as H.R. 1986. <P>
<B>Senate bill</B>: The Senate draft bill would keep the current child count formula for grants to LEAs.<P>
<B>CEC position</B>: CEC supports the current law that requires States to make grants to localities based on the number of children with disabilities served.<BR>

Eligibility
<B>Administration's bill:</B> The bill would change the definition of "child with a disability" to a child who has a physical or mental impairment and who, by reason of that impairment, needs special education and related services.  The bill then defines physical or mental impairment to include the current disability categories.  The bill does, however, change "serious emotional disturbance" to "emotional disturbance."  The bill would continue to allow States the option of using "developmental delay" for children aged 3 through 5.<P>
<B>House draft bill: </B>The bill would keep current language on eligibility but would add "neurobiological brain disorder" to the categories included under the definition of "child with a disability."  The draft would also expand the option States now have to use developmental delay for children aged 3 through 5 to children aged 3 through 9.<P>
<B>Senate bill: </B>The Senate draft bill would keep the current categories of children with disabilities.  The bill would continue current provisions that allow States the option of using "developmental delay" for children aged 3 through 5.<P>
<B>CEC position:</B> CEC supports retaining the current categories and expanding the State's option to include using developmental delay for children aged 3 through 8.  CEC advocates for changing "serious emotional disturbance" to "emotional or behavioral disorder."
<BR>
IEP Team
<BR>
<B>Administration's bill</B>: The bill would require at least one special education provider and at least one regular education teacher, who are, to the maximum extent feasible, individuals who interact with children with disabilities on a daily basis, to participate on the IEP team.<P>
<B>House draft bill</B>: The House draft should require at least one regular education teacher, if the child is or may be participating in the regular education environment, and a special educator or provider to participate in the IEP team.<P>
<B>Senate draft bill</B>: The Senate draft would require a special education provider as well as a regular educator if the student is, or may be, participating in the regular education environment.  The Senate draft would also require on the team an individual who is qualified to interpret the instructional implications of evaluation results.  This requirement may be filled by existing members of the team if they are qualified.<P>
<B>CEC Position</B>: CEC supports language that requires both a special education teacher and a regular education teacher to be a part of the IEP team. 
<BR>
IEP Components
<BR>
<B>Administration's bill:</B> The bill would expand existing components required in the IEP and adds the following new components: a statement of any individual modification in the administration of State or district-wide assessments of student achievement, or if the child will not participate in a particular assessment, a statement of why and how that child will be assessed; and beginning at least one year before the child reaches the age of majority, a statement concerning the rights that will transfer to the child.  The bill would omit short-term objectives in the IEP.   <BR>
<B><BR>
House draft bill:</B> The House bill also expands existing components required in the IEP and includes the additional components called for in H.R. 1986.  The House also requires, where appropriate, a description of behavioral management and behavior modification techniques to be employed to help the child behave appropriately.  The draft bill would omit short-term objectives in the IEP.  <P>
<B>Senate draft bill</B>: The Senate draft language would expand existing requirements and include the following new components: a statement of the extent to which the child will participate with nondisabled children in the general curriculum, in the regular classroom and in extra-curricular and other non-academic activities; and participation in general assessments, including any needed modifications.  The IEP must also include how the child's parents will be regularly informed of the child's progress. For secondary-aged students the IEP must include transition provisions and, at least one year before the age of majority, a statement about the rights that will transfer to the student on reaching the age of majority.  The Senate bill would also omit short term objectives.  The Senate separates other concerns such as behavior management, language needs, communication needs, and braille literacy into a separate section of factors the IEP team should consider. <P>
<B>CEC Position:</B> CEC is concerned that in expanding requirements for the IEP, the bills would result in more burdensome paperwork for the classroom teacher and local administrators.  While CEC fully supports the need for an individualized written program, we understand that the more time spent in addressing different factors in the document, the less time the teacher has to teach or to plan lessons.  For this reason, we urge Congress to limit written requirements in the IEP while outlining additional factors to be considered in the development of the IEP.<P>

Flexibility and Waivers
<B>Administration's bill:</B> The bill would allow States to use 25 percent of the amount allocated under the State grant program for State activities for a broader range of activities and without regard to the prohibition on commingling or supplanting of IDEA funds.  The Administration's bill would allow funds to be used for the costs of special education and related services provided in a regular class to a child with a disability in accordance with the child's IEP, even if one or more nondisabled children benefit from those services.  The bill would also allow an LEA to use not more than 5 percent of funds to develop and implement a coordinated services system.    <P>
<B>House draft bill:</B> The House draft bill would allow States to use only 10 percent of the amount allocated under the State grant program for State activities for a broader range of activities.  The draft would eliminate the prohibition on commingling funds and allow waivers to the prohibition against supplanting funds if the Secretary determines that the State has provided clear evidence that all children with disabilities in the State have available a free appropriate public education (current law) or that such a waiver would allow the State to improve the delivery of special education and related services to children with disabilities in the State.  The bill would also allow an LEA to use not more than 5 percent of funds to develop and implement a coordinated services system.    <P>
The draft authorizes the Secretary to modify any requirement under Part B for 10 designated LEAs.  The House bill would also allow the Secretary to make "modifications" to requirements of Parts B and the early intervention program if a State has at least one LEA that has a demonstration project under the new part D program.  Finally, the House draft bill would include IDEA as one of the education programs whose funds can be commingled in a "school-wide project" allowed under Title I of the ESEA.<P>
The House bill includes similar provisions allowing for incidental benefit for nondisabled children.<P>
<B>Senate draft bill:</B> The Senate bill would continue to allow States to use 25 percent of their funds for State activities. The Senate bill also expands the activities States are allowed to fund.  The draft keeps the current prohibition on commingling of funds and current language governing waivers.  The bill authorizes LEAs to use funds to permit individual schools to design, implement and evaluate "school-based improvement plans."  It  is unclear whether participation in the school improvement program will result in the allowance for waivers.  The bill allows LEAs to use an undetermined (as of the current draft) of funds for a coordinated system.<P>
Similar to the House and the Administration, the Senate draft includes language allowing for incidental benefit to nondisabled children and children covered under ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. <BR>
<B><BR>
CEC position:</B> CEC opposes allowing funds to be used without regard to the prohibition on commingling or supplanting funds.  States should use IDEA funds for activities that improve the State's capacity to meet the educational needs of children with disabilities.  CEC is also strongly opposed to any additional waivers of requirements in IDEA.  Current requirements are important to ensuring educational services to children with disabilities and should not be able to be waived.  Finally, CEC opposes provisions that seem to shift the burden of coordinated services to IDEA rather than to share specified funding for coordinated services across all education programs.  <P>
CEC supports the incidental benefit language that permits children without disabilities and children covered under ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to benefit from services provided to children with disabilities.  
Consolidation of Special Purposes Programs
<B>Administration's bill:</B> For FY 1997, the bill would consolidate the 14 categorical programs funded under Parts C through G of IDEA into 5 new authorities: State Improvement Grants (50 percent of funds for professional development), Professional Development, Research to Practice, Parent Training and Information, and Technology Development and Educational Media Services. <P>
For State Improvement Grants, States must receive at least $400,000 each.  If the total amount appropriated for Parts C through G is at least $254 million, the bill requires the following funding: at least $12.8 million to address the needs of children with deaf blindness: $4.2 million to address the needs of children with emotional disturbance; $10 million to address the needs of children with severe disabilities; and $4 million to address the postsecondary, vocational and adult education needs of individuals with deafness.   For the Parent Training and Information program, States must receive at least $150,000 or the amount that was allocated the previous fiscal year, whichever is greater.  For other existing IDEA authorities such as the clearinghouses, the RRCs, and research and technology, the bill allows the Secretary to expend funds but does not require the Secretary to do so.   <P>
<B>House draft bill:</B> The draft bill would further consolidate the 14 programs into one new Part D.  Part D would have 3 subparts: Subpart I: General Provisions and National Activities; Subpart II: State Program Improvement Grants for Children with Disabilities (75 percent of funds for professional development); and Subpart III: Parent Training. <P>
The House draft bill does not require a minimum funding for State improvement grants.  The House draft includes the same minimum funding requirements for children who are deaf-blind and to address the postsecondary needs of individuals with deafness but does not have a floor for children who have a serious emotional disturbance or have severe disabilities.  The draft authorizes $135.6 million for Subpart I, has not released an authorization level for Subpart II and has an authorization level of $13.5 million for Subpart III.  The bill contains language similar to the Administration's bill that allows the Secretary to expend funds for other purposes but does not require it.   Unlike the Administration's bill, however, the House draft would eliminate any reference to the clearinghouses in language authorizing activities the Secretary may fund.<P>
<B>Senate draft bill:</B> The bill would consolidate the discretionary programs into three main parts: Part C Promoting State Systems Change; Part D Research and Personnel Preparation; Part E Research and Technology Development.  Part C authorizes $30 million for competitive grants to States to support systems change initiatives.  The planning grant cannot exceed $100,000.  For the implementation grant, the minimum grant is $450,000.  For Part D, $56 million is authorized for research and demonstration grants and $81 million for personnel preparation.  Under Part E, there is $13.5 million authorized for parent training and information and $43.4 million for coordinated technical assistance and dissemination, including clearinghouse activities.  Finally, Part E authorizes $30 million for technology development and media activities.  The sum of the proposed authorizations equals the FY 1995 level of funding for current discretionary programs.  The Senate bill does not include the floors for specific categories of children who are included in the Administration's and the House's bill.      <P>
<B>CEC Position</B>: CEC believes that any consolidation of the special purposes programs needs to ensure that the original goals of the programs continue to be addressed.  CEC believes that guaranteed floors and earmarks need to be included for particular priority areas.  The criteria for any consolidation should be: prioritized need areas represented by the current statutory authorities should be maintained; programs with demonstrated effectiveness as they are currently structured should not be restructured; and the worthy objective of greater flexibility in addressing immediate and emerging needs should not take precedent over the obligation to earmark resources for populations and activities that would otherwise be neglected.  CEC is also very concerned that the three national clearinghouses continue to be specifically funded in order to develop and disseminate crucial information on the education of children with disabilities.  Furthermore, CEC is opposed to reducing the level of funding for the discretionary programs and urges inclusion of authorization figures which reflect the current fiscal commitment and allow for at least modest growth.      
Professional Development
<B>Administration's bill: </B>  H.R. 1986 would require each State to have in effect a Comprehensive System of Personnel Development (CSPD).  The bill would require the SEA to establish and maintain standards to ensure that personnel, including paraprofessional personnel, are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, including standards that are consistent with any State-approved or State
recognized certification, licensing, registration or other comparable requirements that apply to the area in which they are providing services.  To the extent the standards are not based on the highest requirements in the State, the State must indicate the steps the State is taking to require the retraining or hiring of personnel that meet appropriate professional requirements in the State.   The Administration's bill requires 50 percent of funds under the State Improvement grants to be spent for professional development.<P>
<B>House draft bill:</B> The House draft bill would eliminate the CSPD requirement in Part B.  The bill would specifically require the SEA to establish and maintain standards to ensure that personnel are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained.  Like the current law, the standards must be consistent with any State
approved or State-recognized certification, licensing, or other comparable requirements that apply to the professional discipline.  To the extent the standards are not based on the highest requirement in the State, the State must specify the steps the State is taking to require retraining or hiring of personnel that meet the appropriate professional requirements in the State (same as in H.R. 1986 and in current law).  The House includes this exception: if, however, a State determines that there is a shortage of appropriate personnel, and the agency has taken steps to recruit and hire such personnel, the State may, subject to public comment and review, temporarily modify the standards for any agencies affected.  The bill also allows paraprofessionals who are appropriately trained and supervised, in accordance with State law, regulations, or written policy, to be used in the provision of special education and related services.  The draft bill requires 75 percent of funds under the State Improvement grants to be spent for professional development.  There are also authorized professional development activities allowed under Part D, Subpart I.<P>
<B>Senate draft bill:</B> The Senate draft would continue the requirement that States have a CSPD.  The bill would keep current language governing the "highest standard" provisions.  The Senate does not include the exceptions that the House does or paraprofessional language.  Personnel preparation continues to be funded under a new Part D that would address: personnel needs for children with high
incidence disabilities, leadership personnel, personnel for children with low
incidence disabilities; and projects of national significance. <P>
<B>CEC Position:</B> CEC opposes any removal of the requirement that each State has a CSPD.  We encourage a cautious and practical approach to the issue of improving in-State professional development capacity.  CEC is further concerned that any personnel development plan be developed through a process that promotes linkages among all involved State agencies, institutions, and organizations that are concerned with a continuing supply of qualified personnel to serve children with disabilities.  Also,  CEC supports efforts to address the "highest standards" issue in IDEA and the assignment of responsibility for establishing and maintaining standards to the SEA.  We believe the foundational role of the professions in setting standards is important and would use the term "professional standards" throughout the highest standard provisions.  We do not believe a proposed highest standard exemption is necessary and oppose this amendment.  Finally, while the House draft language addressing paraprofessionals clarifies those who are qualified to provide services to children with disabilities, we believe this clarification should be made within a broader framework defining different levels of personnel within disciplines.   <BR>

Discipline<P>
<B>
Administration's bill:</B> The bill would replace the current "a firearm" with "a dangerous weapon," allowing any child with a disability that brings a dangerous weapon to school to be placed in an interim alternative educational setting (IAES) for not more than 45 days.  The bill also allows a hearing officer to order a change in the placement of a child with a disability to an IAES for not more than 45 days if the public agency demonstrated by substantial evidence that maintaining the child in his or her current placement is substantially likely to result in injury to self or to others.<P>
<B>House draft bill:</B> The bill would allow a hearing officer to place a child with a disability who brings a weapon or drugs to school, or has committed a violent act, or if the maintenance of the current placement is  substantially likely to result in injury to self or others, into an IAES for not more than 45 days.  Finally, the House would allow the cessation of educational services for a child with a disability whose behavior was not a manifestation of the disability.  If parents begin due process proceedings, the child will continue to receive educational services during proceedings.      <P>
<B>Senate draft language:</B> The Senate draft bill has much more extensive language that addresses the determination of manifestation, disruptive children, and children who have a disability but who have not yet been determined eligible for special education.<P>
For suspension of a child with a disability for longer than 10 school days, the Senate draft would require the IEP team to determine if the child's behavior was not a manifestation of the child's disability and if such policy is applied to all children who engage in the behavior.  If the behavior is found not to be a manifestation of the disability, the child may be disciplined in the same manner as other children; however, the child will continue to receive educational services unless the child was involved with dangerous weapons or drugs and the policy of the agency is to cease services to any child involved with dangerous weapons or drugs.   If the parents disagree with the determination, they may request an expedited due process hearing.  During the pendency of such procedures, the child shall continue to receive educational services.<P>
If a child with a disability has a dangerous weapon; engages in the illegal use, possession or distribution of drugs; or engages in behavior that results in or is substantially likely to engage in behavior that would result in serious bodily injury, the child may be placed in an IAES regardless of whether the behavior is a manifestation of the disability.  In order to place a child in an IAES within 10 days of when the behavior occurred or when the behavior became known to the principal, the principal, after consultation with individuals knowledgeable of the child's disability and the chair of the IEP team, and, if appropriate, the agency's director of special education, must determine in writing that the child engaged in the behavior.  The child's IEP team must then assess and identify modifications in the child's IEP that are necessary for placement in an IAES consistent with the provision of FAPE.  The placement of a child in an IAES must, to the maximum extent feasible, be made within these 10 school days.   In no case shall the placement of the child in the IAES occur later than 20 days.  If the principal's determination and the IEP team's actions do not occur within the time frame, the child's placement shall be the one described in the child's current IEP, unless the parents and the agency agree otherwise.<P>
If the parents disagree with the principal's determination, they can request an expedited hearing.  During the pendency of the due process proceedings, the child shall remain in the IAES, unless the parents and the agency agree otherwise. <P>
For a child with a disability who engages in ongoing serious disruptive behavior that significantly impairs the education of the child, the education of other children, or the ability of the child's teacher to teach, the child may be placed in an IAES if the principal, in consultation with individuals knowledgeable about the child's disability, the chair of the child's IEP team, and if appropriate, the  the agency's director of special education, determines in writing that the child's current placement would significantly impair the education of the child, the other children or the ability of the teacher to teach.  In order for the principal or a hearing officer to determine that the child is engaging in ongoing serious disruptive behavior, there must be a cumulative record over an extended period of time. The child's IEP team then develops a placement in an IAES consistent with FAPE.  If the child was disciplined for a period of up to 10 days, the principal's determination and the IEP team's actions shall occur within such time period, not to exceed 10 school days.  If the parents disagree with the determination, a hearing officer, within 10 school days of the child's parents communicating disagreement to the principal, shall rule on whether the placement of the child in an IAES was justified.  If the decision is not rendered within 10 school days, the child's placement shall be the one described in the child's IEP, unless the parents of the child and the agency agree otherwise.    <P>
A child who has not yet been determined eligible for special education may be eligible for the authorized protections if the agency had knowledge that the child has a disability before the behavior occurred.  The agency is considered to have knowledge of a child's disability if:  the child's parents expressed concern, in writing if practicable, to agency personnel about the child's behavior, including but not limited to a parental request for an evaluation; or the child's teacher, or other personnel expressed concern about the child's behavior to the agency's director of special education.  If the agency did not have knowledge of the child's disability, the child may be subject to the same disciplinary procedures as other children.<P>
<B>CEC Position:</B> CEC  believes that an IAES should be allowed for no more than 45 days for a child with a disability who is a "danger to self or others."  However, placement in the 45-day setting must, like any change of placement procedure used to move a child, be the least restrictive placement possible.  The IDEA requirement for FAPE must be upheld regardless of the setting in which the child is placed.  CEC believes that current law adequately addresses disruptive behavior from a child with a disability and oppose additional provisions which may have unintended negative consequences.  Further, CEC believes that no child should be permanently expelled from school.
<BR>
Procedural Safeguards
<B>Administration's bill:</B> The bill would require States to provide parents with the option of using mediation to resolve disputes.  The bill would also significantly expand requirements for parental notice.<P>
<B>House draft bill: </B>The House would also require States to provide parents with the option of using mediation but prohibits attorneys from attending; however, the House does allow the parent to bring a non-attorney representative.  Also, the mediation would not be considered part of administrative proceedings.  The House also would expand requirements for parental notice but would limit the number of times the agency has to send out information on procedural safeguards.  The draft bill also includes language stating that "a minor change of instructional strategies to carry out the IEP of the child shall not be considered to be a change requiring a notice to the parents...."<P>
<B>Senate draft bill</B>: The Senate draft would also require States to provide parents with the option of using mediation.  Unlike the House, however, the Senate bill would not prohibit attorneys from attending and does not state that mediation would not be considered part of administrative proceedings.   The Senate bill would also greatly expand parental notice requirements.<P>
<B>CEC position: </B>CEC has been at the forefront of calling for mediation to be included in IDEA.   CEC supports the House draft language that limits the number of times an agency has to send out the same information on procedural safeguards.  CEC also supports the House language that does not require parental notice for minor modifications to instructional strategies.   CEC is concerned, however, that all three of the proposed bills on reauthorization would result in more paperwork for schools and will continue to result in parents being overwhelmed by the length and amount of technical information included in the basic notice. 
Early Childhood
<B>Administration bill:</B> Continues authorization of the Federal Interagency Coordinating Council (FICC).  <B><P>
House draft bill: </B>The House draft would eliminate the FICC.<B><P>
Senate draft bill:</B> The Senate bill would continue authorization of the FICC.<B><P>
CEC Position:   </B>CEC continues to support the goals of the FICC, and urges that the requirement of an FICC be retained in the law.  Especially at a time when there is the prospect of further constraints on other federal resources available to assist in meeting the objectives of Part H, having an FICC to coordinate the collective federal effort becomes even more necessary. <B><BR>

<BR>
SUMMARY OF THE ADMINISTRATION, HOUSE, AND SENATE LANGUAGE ON<BR>
 THE  DISCIPLINE OF CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES  IN IDEA<U><BR>
</U>(October 2, 1995)<U><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
I.  DRAFT DISCIPLINE LANGUAGE IN SENATE:</B></U><P>
<B>Four Categories Allowed for Placement in Interim Alternative Education Setting (IAES).  </B>A child with a disability can be placed in an IAES for not more than 45 days if the child:<P>
1.     Has a dangerous weapon in his or her possession (a weapon is defined as a weapon, device, instrument, material or substance, animate or inanimate, that is used for or is readily capable of causing death or serious bodily injury);<BR>
<BR>
2.     Sexually assaults another individual;<BR>
<BR>
3.     Engages in behavior that results in [life-threatening/serious] injury or is substantially likely to result in [life-threatening/serious] injury to another individual, where [life-threatening/serious] injury is defined as an injury involving a substantial risk of death, loss or substantial impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ or mental faculty, or a serious and protracted disfigurement; or<BR>
<BR>
4.     Engages in the illegal use, possession or distribution of drugs.<P>
<B>Additional Requirements for Sexual Assault or Life Threatening Behavior</B>.   For sexual assault or behavior that is likely to result in [life-threatening/serious] injury, there must be a written finding by a superintendent, in consultation with the special education director of the agency, other individuals with knowledge of the child and the child's disability, and the chair of the child's IEP team, that the child's behavior met the criteria for removal to an IAES.<P>
<B>Disruptive Behavior</B>.  If the agency and the child's parents do not agree to the removal of a child with a disability to an IAES because of the child's serious disruptive behavior, a hearing officer, to the same extent as a court, may order a change in placement to an IAES for not more than 45 days if the agency demonstrates that maintaining the child in the current placement is so seriously disruptive as to significantly impair the education of the child or other children.  In order for a hearing office to determine that a child is seriously disruptive, there must be a cumulative record over a [significant/reasonable] period of time describing behaviors exhibited by the child that frequently and contemporaneously prevent the child, classmates or teacher from engaging in activities; and there must be documented evidence of efforts such as reconvening of the IEP team to consider the appropriateness of the current IEP, the provision of special education and related services, the use of supplemental aids and services and strategies, including the use of behavior management plans that have been properly implemented over a [significant/reasonable] period of time and have failed to eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the behaviors of the child that were seriously disruptive.<P>
<B>Manifestation Determination.  </B>To determine the manifestation, the following factors <U>shall</U> be considered:<P>
1.     The appropriateness of the child's IEP and placement;<BR>
<BR>
2.     The extent to which the child's IEP has been implemented and has included the provision of special and related services, and the use of supplementary aids and services, strategies and interventions, and behavior management techniques; and<BR>
<BR>
3.     The extent to which the child's disability prevented the child from understanding the impact and consequences of the behavior.<BR>
<P>
<BR>
The following factors <U>may</U> be considered:<P>
1.     The extent to which the child exhibited similar behavior in the past;<BR>
<BR>
2.     Evaluation and diagnostic results, including any results supplied by the parents of the child;<BR>
<BR>
3.     Observation by a person knowledgeable about the child and the child's disability, including to the extent possible, an observation in the environment in which the behavior occurred;<BR>
<BR>
4.     The context in which the behavior at issue arose; and <BR>
<BR>
5.     The extent to which the child's disability impaired the child's ability to control the behavior at issue.<BR>
<BR>
The determination of manifestation shall be made by a group of individuals, including the child's parents, knowledgeable about the child's disability, including knowledge about the manner in which the disability is affected by the environmental factors. <B><P>
No Manifestation</B>.  If the child's behavior is found not to be a manifestation of the disability and the child has had a dangerous weapon in his or her possession or has engaged in the illegal use, possession or distribution of drugs, then the child shall be subject to the same disciplinary procedures and access to educational services as a nondisabled  child according to State and local laws.  If parents do not agree, a due process hearing may be initiated. During the pendency of the procedures, the child will continue to receive educational services.<BR>
<B><BR>
Timing and Effect of Assertion of Child's Disability.  </B>A child who has not yet been determined to be eligible for special education and related services, and who engaged in the behaviors, may assert the protection under these provisions if the State and local education agency had knowledge that the child was disabled before the behavior that precipitated disciplinary action occurred.  The following factors will be considered to determine whether the agency had knowledge about the disability:<P>
1.     The child's parents expressed concern to the agency, in writing if practicable, about the child's behavior; including but not limited to a parental request for an evaluation of their child to determine the child's eligibility for special education and related services; or<BR>
<BR>
2.     The child's teacher or other personnel expressed concern about the child's behavior to the agency's department of special education. <BR>
<BR>
If the agency had no knowledge of the child's disability, the child may be subjected to the same disciplinary actions as other children who commit comparable offenses, provided that, if a request is made for an evaluation of the child, it be done on an expedited basis.  If the child is determined to have a disability, the agency will provide special education and related services.<P>
<B>Persons Involved in the Determination of IAES.</B>  The IAES shall be decided by individuals knowledgeable about  evaluation data pertaining to the child and others knowledgeable about programming, services and placement options, which may include individuals on the IEP team, and shall include the child's parents.  The IAES shall be consistent with the right of the child to FAPE. <P>
<B>Child's Placement During Pendency.  </B>If a parent of a child with a disability requests a due process hearing, the child will remain in the IAES during the pendency of any proceedings unless the parents and LEA agree otherwise. <P>
<B>Comparability of Services.  </B>A child with a disability who is found to have engaged in the listed behaviors will have access to the same due process and educational services as children without disabilities who exhibit similar behaviors, to the extent that such due process does not conflict with, or educational opportunities are less, than those specified. <P>
<B>Referral to Juvenile Authorities.  </B>Nothing in these provisions prohibits an agency from reporting a crime committed by a child with a disability to police or juvenile authorities or to prevent State juvenile and judicial authorities from exercising their responsibilities with regard to the application of juvenile or criminal laws to crimes committed by a child with a disability. <P>
<BR>
<B><U>II.  CURRENT ADMINISTRATION/DEMOCRATIC BILL LANGUAGE ON DISCIPLINE (H.R. 1986)</B><P>
<B></U>Bringing a Weapon to School</B>.  The Administration replaces the current "a firearm" with "a dangerous weapon," allowing any child with a disability that brings a weapon to school to be placed in an IAES for not more than 45 days.   <P>
<B>Dangerous Behavior Likely to Occur</B>.  The bill also allows a hearing officer to order a change in the placement of a child with a disability to an IAES for not more than 45 days, if the public agency demonstrates by substantial evidence that maintaining the child in his or her current placement is substantially likely to result in injury to himself or herself, or to others.  If a parent requests a hearing, the child shall remain in the IAES during the pendency unless the parents and the SEA or LEA agree otherwise.<P>
<B><U>III.  HOUSE REPUBLICAN DRAFT LANGUAGE</B></U><P>
<B>Dangerous Behavior Likely to Occur</B>.  The House bill would allow a hearing officer to order a change in the placement of a child with a disability to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting for not more than 45 days if the agency demonstrates by substantial evidence that maintaining the child in his current placement is substantially likely to result in injury to himself or to others.  In ordering a change in placement, the hearing officer shall consider the appropriateness of the placement and the implementation of specific behavior management techniques identified in the child's IEP.  If the parents requests a hearing, the child would remain in the IAES during any pendency, unless the parents and the SEA or LEA agree otherwise.<P>
<B>Bringing a Weapon to School or Violent Acts.  </B>The House bill also allows a child with a disability who brings a weapon (as defined by State law or State policy) to school or has committed a violent act at school, to be placed in an appropriate IAES for not more than 45 days.  The IAES shall be determined by the IEP team.    If the parents request a hearing, the child would remain in the IAES during any pendency, unless the parents and the SEA or LEA agree otherwise.  <P>
<B>Manifestation of a Disability</B>.  If a change in placement or disciplinary proceedings are contemplated, a review shall be conducted within 45 days into the relationship between the child's disability and the behavior which might warrant expulsion or other appropriate disciplinary action.  In carrying out a review, the individuals shall consider appropriate factors, including:<P>
1.     The appropriateness of the child's placement;<BR>
<BR>
2.     The implementation of specific behavior management techniques identified in the IEP; <BR>
<BR>
3.     Evaluation and diagnostic results, which may include any such results supplied by the parents or guardian of the child; and<BR>
<BR>
4.     Observations.<P>
If the result of the review is a determination that the behavior of the child with a disability was a manifestation of the child's disability and the parents of such child agree with such determination, the educational placement of the child may be changed.  If the parents do not agree with the determination, an immediate appeal may be made to a hearing officer to determine whether the child's placement should be changed.  Any party aggrieved by the findings of the hearing officer may initiate a due process hearing.<P>
If the behavior was not a manifestation of the disability, the relevant disciplinary procedures applicable to children with disabilities shall be applied in the same manner in which they would be applied to children without disabilities.  If the parents do not agree, a due process hearing may be initiated.  During the pendency of the due process procedures, the child shall continue to receive educational services.

House Issues Discussion Draft of IDEA Reauthorization<P>
<BR>
Reston, Aug. 1, 1995 -- The House Committee on Economic and Educational<BR>
Opportunities is circulating a "staff discussion draft," which is dated July 27. <BR>
According to House staffers, they plan to mark up this bill sometime in<BR>
September, after the August recess.  The draft only discusses recommendations<BR>
for Parts A (Administrative), B (State grants), and C (Infants and toddlers,<BR>
formerly Part H).  Following is a brief summary of the draft's summary:<P>
Categorization/Eligibility:  The House wants to allow a more flexible approach<BR>
to providing special education and related services for young children.  They<BR>
have adopted CEC's recommendation to allow states to extend use of<BR>
"developmental delay" definition for children up to age 9.<P>
Funding formula:  The House proposes to phase out the "head count" formula,<BR>
and ease in a population-based formula over the next 10 years.<P>
LRE:  States will be required to have "placement neutral" funding formulas.<P>
Discipline/Stay-put:  Student's IEP will include behavior management<BR>
techniques; allow hearing officer to remove a potentially dangerous student and<BR>
place in an alternative placement for up to 45 days (same as Dept. of Ed's bill);<BR>
allow removal from classroom for 45 days for students that engage in violent<BR>
acts or bring weapons to school (same as ED bill and CEC's recommendations).<P>
PLUS:  If action is not disability-related, any school discipline policy applied to<BR>
non-disabled students may be equally applied to the disabled students.  CEC is<BR>
opposed to this, and believes that even if a child with a disability is expelled,<BR>
the school must still provide a FAPE in the LRE possible.<P>
Mediation:  States must provide voluntary mediation to parents. CEC made this<BR>
recommendation also.<P>
Attorneys' fees:  maintain current law on attorneys' fees allowance for parents<BR>
that prevail; allow judge to withhold attorneys' fees if parents do not give<BR>
schools 10-day advance writen notice of their concerns before filing complaint;<BR>
when multiple issues are in dispute, allow judge to award attorneys' fees only<BR>
for issues in which parents prevailed.<P>
Policy Letters vs. Regulations:  Certain policy interpretations with broad<BR>
applicability should be subject to public comment and review.<P>
Part C (formerly Part H):  continue current law policy allowing states to serve<BR>
at-risk children, but do not create any new requirements relating to at-risk (CEC<BR>
agrees with this).<P>
The House is asking for comments by Thursday, August 3; additional comments<BR>
will be accepted until August 28.  They should be addressed to the attention of<BR>
Deanna Waldron, Room 2181 Rayburn House Office Building, Washington,<BR>
DC  20515.<BR>

<B><I>Impact on Children with Exceptionalities</B></I><U><BR>
</U><BR>
While all of these bills, if enacted, will ultimately affect children with exceptionalities and their families, some provisions could have immediate repercussions on education programs for children.  Unfortunately, only the "American Dream Savings Account" proposal in the <B>American Dream Restoration Act</B> would directly encourage investment in education.  Even then, the only benefit to such a savings account would be that a family would pay income taxes on the amount deposited but not on the amount withdrawn.   The funds could be used for education expenses at a postsecondary institution (college or training institution) for self, spouse or dependent child.<P>
Alarmingly, the contract does include several budgetary proposals that could have a detrimental effect on education programs for children with exceptionalities.  For example, the balanced budget amendment would cause severe cuts in federal spending.  Given that the contract also includes proposals to increase funding for law enforcement and prison construction by $20.5 billion and will cut taxes, the question the education community needs to ask is, "Where are the funding cuts going to come from to balance the budget, and how is the country going to pay for the new initiatives?"  <P>
The Contract also proposes reestablishing the "firewalls" around the defense budget.  This provision would prevent any redistribution of funds from defense needs to domestic needs.  This would make it even harder to gain funding increases in the education arena.  <P>
Finally, in the <B>Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act</B>, there are a series of regulatory "reforms" that could affect laws for individuals with disabilities.  CEC will continue to monitor these legislative initiatives and keep you informed.

<B>FACT SHEET<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
NUMBER OF CHILDREN SERVED UNDER PART B CONTINUES TO RISE; <BR>
Over Half Identified as Having LD</B><P>
The number of students served under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Chapter 1 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) has steadily increased since IDEA's inception in 1975.  For the school years of 1992-93, 5,170,242 children from birth through age 21 were served; an increase of 3.7 % from the previous year.  Of those served, over half (52.4%) of the students age 6 through 21 were identified as having specific learning disabilities.  <P>
These figures were reported in the U.S. Department of Education's (DoE) <I>16th Annual Report to Congress on the Implementation of IDEA.</I> The report is the largest comprehensive study of how students with disabilities are currently being served under the Act.  Educators look to the annual report to find out how the IDEA is being implemented, and what the outcomes are of those served. Following are some of the report's findings:<P>
<CENTER><B>Students Served, Placement and Exiting Patterns,<BR>
and Personnel Shortages</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
&iuml;     Despite annual increases in the number of teachers and other staff employed to serve school-age children during 1991-92, <B>there was still a shortage of approximately 27,000 teachers and more than 5,400 teacher aides</B>, a 1.3% increase over those needed during the previous year.<BR>
<BR>
     Teachers of students with specific learning disabilities are most in demand, followed<BR>
     by teachers specializing in speech or language impairments and those trained to teach<BR>
     students with SED.  For 3- through 5-year-old students with disabilities, 2,288<BR>
     preschool teachers were needed during the 1991-92 school year, 11.2% fewer than in<BR>
     1990-91.<P>
&iuml;     For FY 1993, $2.053 billion was distributed to States to provide special education to children with disabilities through Part B of IDEA, with an average allocation of $411 per child, up $1 from the previous year.  At 1992-93 spending levels, DoE says, Congress provided approximately 8.3 % of average per child expenditures under Part B. <B> In order to meet the 40% target authorized under the Act, Congress would have had to allocate approximately $9.7 billion in funding for special education</B> -- a difference of over $7 billion!<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     More children are being placed in more integrated settings than ever before, DoE states.  Approximately 95% of students with disabilities received education and related services in regular school buildings in 1991-92. Of those, 34.9% were served in the regular classroom (includes students with disabilities receiving special education and related services outside the regular classroom for less than 21% of the school day), 36.3% in a resource room within the school (includes the receipt of special education and related services outside the regular classroom for at least 21% but no more than 60% of the school day), and 23.5% were served in separate classes but still within the regular school building.  Only 5.3% were served either in separate schools, residential facilities, or were in homebound/hospital programs.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Students ages 6 through 21 with speech or language impairments made up 21.6% of those served under Part B and Chapter 1 (SOP); those with mental retardation, 11.5%; serious emotional disturbance, 8.7%; and multiple disabilities, 2.2%.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Of the 229,368 students who exited the educational system during 1991-92, 43.9% received a standard high school diploma, and 13.5% received a certificate of completion or other form of modified diploma. Although 22.4% dropped out of school during this year, the dropout percentage for students with disabilities has decreased steadily over the past 5 years, and the graduation percentage has shown a general upward trend, DoE says.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>Infants, Toddlers, and Preschool Children</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
&iuml;     As of July 1, 1992, 18 states and jurisdictions were in full implementation status of  Part H of IDEA, which provides grants to states for early intervention programs for infants and toddlers with disabilities, ages birth through two.  By the close of the FY 1992 award period, a total of 41 states and jurisdictions had been awarded grants for full implementation.  Congress appropriated $175 million in Part H funds for the states in FY 1992, and $213.3 million in FY 1993.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Under Chapter 1 (SOP), 76,449 infants and toddlers with disabilities were served in 1992-93, a 15% increase over 1991-92.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     FY 1992 was the first year all states were required to provide a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) for all 3 to 5-year olds with disabilities.  Approximately $325.8 million was appropriated in FY 1993, nearly $6 million more than in FY 1992.  However, the number of preschoolers rose to 441,748 from the previous year's figure of 398,757, so the increase in funding was offset by the increase in number of children served.  The per child allocation under the Section 619 Preschool Grant Program in FY 1993 was $738, down from $804 in the previous year.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>Secondary School Programs</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
The <I>Annual Report</I> reiterates information from the National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS) funded by the DoE's Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) which states that students with disabilities who attended regular schools had higher absenteeism and dropout rates, and lower grades than the general student population.  Poor results were disproportionately experienced by students in the largest disability categories -- those with learning disabilities, mental retardation, and serious emotional disturbance.  The Study also found that students with disabilities who completed four years of high school earned a cumulative GPA of 2.3, compared to a national average of 2.6.<P>
<CENTER><B>Students with Serious Emotional Disturbance</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
&iuml;     Under Part B, the percent of students served in 1992-93 is 8.3%.  Data suggests that a high proportion of SED students identified are from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, or from minority or culturally and linguistically different backgrounds.  <BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Students with SED have lower grades and higher dropout rates than any other group of students with disabilities.  About 17% of youth with SED go on to college compared with 53% of students without disabilities.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Students with SED are far more likely than any other group with disabilities to be served in special education programs outside regular schools.  In the 1991-92 school year, almost 20% of students with SED were served outside regular schools, compared to 5% of students with other disabilities.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>Educational Results</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
The National Center on Educational Outcomes (NCEO) has been working since 1990 to address issues related to assessing educational results for students with disabilities.<P>
&iuml;     Students with disabilities are proportionately excluded from both state and national assessments for a variety of reasons. Guidelines about inclusion and exclusion, where they exist, are inconsistently applied.  Students may be excluded for reasons that are only incidental to their disability -- for example, telephone surveys usually exclude people who are deaf or use telecommunication devices.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>Native American Children with Disabilities</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
&iuml;     About 44,000 students receiving special education are Native American.  This ethnic group is more likely to receive special education services than all other racial/ethnic groups, except for African Americans.  Provision of special education services to Native American students with disabilities can be challenging due to high numbers of students with limited English proficiency, cultural differences, and residence in rural areas.  Assessment of these students is also complicated by the limited number of instruments which might be useful for students from different languages and culture groups.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Native American children with disabilities attending schools administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) are more likely to receive special education services in a resource room.<BR>
&iuml;     There is an acute shortage of personnel qualified to provide special education services to Native American students with disabilities.  During school year 1990-91, BIA schools needed to increase the number of special education teachers employed by about 60%, compared to a need of 9% for the nation as a whole.<BR>

December 6, 1995<P>
Dr. Patricia Morrissey<BR>
Staff Director<BR>
Subcommittee on Disability Policy<BR>
422 Dirksen Senate Office Building<BR>
Washington, DC 20510<P>
Dear Dr. Morrissey:<P>
We have completed our initial review of the committee staff draft documents prepared for the pending reauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  We congratulate the staff for having developed an excellent policy document, bold in  its attention to future policy directions and thoughtful in its attention to the primary matters at issue in this important reauthorization.  CEC is pleased to endorse both the general directions and the basic content of this draft as a solid and dependable vehicle for consideration of all reauthorization issues.<P>
CEC is pleased that a proper balance has been struck in the draft between a continuing commitment to the basic foundations of the IDEA and an effort to facilitate emerging directions in American education as they relate to children with disabilities, i.e. school reform, in-state partnerships, and coordinated service systems.<P>
However, as may be readily observed in our attached comments, there are a number of changes, refinements, and clarifications which CEC recommends to the Senate committee.  Given the openness of Senate staff throughout the process, which we appreciate, the Council knows that these remaining matters at issue in this reauthorization will be addressed in a manner which will benefit children with disabilities, their families, and the persons who serve them.<P>
Sincerely, <P>
<BR>
<BR>
Nancy D. Safer<BR>
Interim Executive Director<P>

<CENTER><B>Comments on the Senate Draft Bill on the<BR>
Reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</B><BR>
</CENTER><P>
<B><U>UNDER PART A:</B></U><P>
<B>Findings</B>.  CEC commends the Senate for the positive statements on special education in the findings section of the draft bill.  We also believe including statements regarding the constitutional basis for IDEA is a worthy initiative.<P>
<B>Definitions.</B>   We support the Senate's decision not to add additional categories to the 13 eligibility categories already listed under IDEA.  We urge the Subcommittee, however, to adopt the Administration's proposal for changing the term "serious emotional disturbance" to "emotional disturbance."  The term "serious" is pejorative and unnecessary.   Finally, we recommend the Senate allow States the option of using the term "developmental delay" for ages 3 through 8 to allow children with disabilities to be served in the primary grades without the need for the designation of a diagnostic category.  We believe that this option would allow services to those children who clearly are eligible for special education but for whom it is difficult to pinpoint the specific disability at an early age.<P>
<B>Administrative Provisions</B>.  We are unclear as to the intent of the limitation of the use of funds in Sec. 610(c)(3).  We are also concerned that the Subcommittee would authorize only standing panels to review grant applications.  While CEC affirms the potential value of standing panels for some uses, only authorizing standing committees may not be practical given the number and range of applications received by the U.S. Department of Education.  Some flexibility may be needed in the review process.<P>
CEC is concerned that Sec. 610(e)(D) seems to allow authority for grants under Part D and E for activities addressing the needs of low-achieving students, underserved populations, children from low-income families, children with limited-English proficiency and unserved and underserved areas.  While we agree that projects in these areas are important, we oppose using scarce resources available under Parts D and E for populations other than the originally intended population, namely children with disabilities.<P>
<B><U>UNDER PART B:</B></U><P>
<B>Federal Commitment to Children with Disabilities</B>.  CEC commends the Senate for retaining language specifying the federal financial commitment to children with disabilities.  Even though the Federal government has never met its commitment to provide States 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure for every child with a disability, it is extremely important to work towards this goal.  By keeping the commitment language, the Senate reaffirms the basic IDEA partnership between States and the Federal government.<P>
<B>Formula to States. </B> CEC supports the retention of the current formula for State grants.   A formula change could cause large shifts in the amount of funds States receive to assist in providing services to children with disabilities.  We also believe that a formula change may penalize States which have worked diligently to identify and serve all students with disabilities.  <P>
<B>State Activities.  </B>CEC supports the Senate draft's retention of language allowing States to use 25 percent of funds  for State level activities.  States use these IDEA funds for statewide activities that continuously improve the State's capacity to meet the educational needs of  children with disabilities by providing inservice training, responding to concerns identified in federal monitoring, and in providing direct and support services to children.  <P>
<B>CSPD.  </B>CEC is pleased that the Senate draft would retain the requirement that each State maintain a comprehensive system of personnel development.  CEC remains concerned, however, that any personnel development plan be developed and promoted through a process that promotes linkages in each State among all involved State agencies, institutions and organizations that are concerned with a continuing supply of qualified personnel to serve children with disabilities.  CEC observes that the concept of in-State partnerships is a major feature of the new proposed Part C of the Senate draft, and we applaud the inclusion of that feature.  We look forward to continuing discussion of how that concept may be specifically applied to the CSPD, and will continue to encourage a Professional Development Coordinating Council (PDCC) charged with the specific task of developing and implementing the in-State CSPD.<P>
<B>Personnel Standards</B>.  We note and approve the retention of the current statute respecting personnel standards commencing on page 22 of the draft.  We continue to urge, as portrayed in our formal testimony,  the inclusion of three important modifications with respect to the "highest requirement" provisions.<P>
We believe that the statute must specifically assign responsibility for establishing and maintaining standards to the State education agency. Further, we believe that the foundational role of the professions in setting standards is vital and would use the term "professional standards" throughout this section.<P>
Finally, we recommend inclusion of the following language in the statute:  "Establishment and Use of Levels of Personnel Within Disciplines.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, nothing prohibits the establishment and use by the State education agency of different levels of personnel, including paraprofessionals, within specific occupations or disciplines if the State also specifies appropriate roles and responsibilities, training, and direct and indirect supervision by certified professionals for each level."<P>
<B>Prohibition on Commingling Funds and Waiver on Supplanting of Funds.</B>   CEC supports the Senate draft's retention of the prohibition on commingling of IDEA funds with other funds.  IDEA funds are meant to provide services to children with disabilities and should continue to be for that purpose only.  We also support the current language, retained by the Senate, on supplanting of funds.  With limited federal funds supporting services to children with disabilities now, CEC believes allowing IDEA funds to be supplanted or commingled would leave funds for services for children with disabilities extremely vulnerable.  CEC strongly urges the Subcommittee to restore these prohibitions. <P>
<B>Allowing a Reduction in Expenditures for LEA.  </B>CEC recognizes the circumstances behind provisions in Sec. 612(a)(3)(E) allowing for an LEA to reduce its level of expenditures if there is a departure from the LEA's system of particular students with higher service needs, or there are one-time expenditures by the LEA in the preceding fiscal year, as legitimate reduction of special education expenditures and therefore, concur with these exceptions.  We have concerns, however, with exception (I) which could be used to justify replacing experienced, qualified staff with lesser qualified personnel simply to reduce costs and we oppose this exception as written.<P>
<B>Coordinated System.  </B>While we believe that the coordinated service system authorized in Sec. 612(f) is desirable, it is unclear how costs will be shared among programs.  The amendment seems to allow LEAs the ability to use IDEA funds to develop and implement a coordinated services system to improve results for children and families without requiring either funds from other sources or provisions that the IDEA funds used are proportionate to the number of children with disabilities likely to be served.  <BR>
<B><BR>
Incidental Benefit.</B>  CEC strongly supports the progressive language in the Subcommittee's draft bill in Sec. 613(a)(4) that allows local funds to be provided to a child with a disability in a regular class, even if one or more nondisabled children benefit from those services, or children covered under ADA or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.   These common sense provisions will go a long way in allowing teachers and related services personnel to provide services to IDEA eligible children without regard to the incidental benefit to other children. <P>
<B>School-based Improvement Plan</B>.  CEC observes the section providing for a school-based improvement plan which is focused on specific schools, seeks to improve the educational and transitional results for children with disabilities, and is linked to authorized activities under the new Part C.<P>
CEC has no quarrel with the worthy objective, but has some questions.  Would these authorized arrangements allow waivers or modifications of any of the provisions of Parts A and B, such as any rights guarantees or provisions prohibiting supplanting and commingling of funds?  Would this section allow more than one school in a district to participate, and, correspondingly, could all schools in a district participate?  Would the establishment of such arrangements encourage a concentration of Part B funds on the particular school(s) in question?  Finally, what precisely is being authorized that school districts and their schools cannot do now?<P>
<B>Re-evaluation</B>.  Among the many features of the Senate draft which CEC strongly supports is the stipulation that re- evaluations occur every 3 years <U>or</U> at key transition junctures in the educational process, for instance at the time of transition from elementary school to middle or junior high school. This stipulation coupled with provisions related to situations in which additional data is not needed will promote far more useful and appropriate re-evaluations.<P>
<B>Individual Education Program.  </B>CEC reaffirms its support for the Subcommittee's efforts to clarify IEP language in meeting the child's needs in relation to the general curriculum and for the overall refinements made in the IEP section.<P>
<B>Discipline.  </B>CEC looks forward to reviewing the Subcommittee's language regarding any changes in the discipline of children with disabilities.  CEC believes that alternative procedures should be authorized for an immediate threat to classroom safety.  We strongly believe, however, that no child should be permanently expelled and that children with disabilities and who are suspended should continue to receive FAPE.  <P>
<B>Parental Notice. </B> While CEC supports the Subcommittee's attempt to clarify the content of parental notices, we are very concerned that the provisions of Sec. 615(c) will result in more paperwork for schools and will continue to result in parents being overwhelmed by the length and amount of technical information included in the basic notice.  CEC believes that the House Committee's second draft provides a framework that guarantees parents necessary information but does not require the entire packet of information to be sent every time the parents are notified of a change.    <P>
<B>Notification of School of Intention to File a Complaint.</B>   CEC supports the Subcommittee's language requiring parents to notify the school of their intention to file a complaint at least 10 days prior to the date of filing if parents have new information or if the LEA is unaware of the nature of the complaint.  We believe this provision will assist schools and parents in working together to solve problems before the need for litigation.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Mediation.  </B>CEC supports the Subcommittee's provisions that would require SEAs to provide mediation as an option to parents.  However, while CEC affirms the need for parents to have the support they need for mediation and a role in structuring the mediation, we are concerned that the process as structured does not result in an adversarial process as sometimes results in the current due process procedures.  We prefer the House Committee's draft language in this section.  <P>
<B>Policy/Regulations</B>.   CEC supports the subcommittee's inclusion of language that would prohibit the Secretary from establishing a new rule without following the public comment and review requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act.  We also support the requirement that the Secretary publish in the Federal Register a list of correspondence from the Department of Education and include a description of the interpretation of the Department.  The Subcommittee may want to clarify that this requirement only applies to new issues that are addressed by the Department.<P>
<B>Preschool Program.</B>  CEC supports the retention of the current formula for the Preschool program and commends the Subcommittee for its long standing commitment to the program.  We are concerned, however, that the coordination language does not have the 1 percent cap that is included for State-level coordination activities under the larger Part B program.  CEC urges the Subcommittee to institute a similar cap.<P>
<B>Support Programs</B>.  CEC wishes to acknowledge, with appreciation, the manner in which the Senate provides a sound basic framework for the vital support programs of IDEA as presented in the draft primarily under Parts C, D, and E. While the number of appropriation line-items would be reduced, major, proven components of the existing support programs would be retained with the overall proposed funding level constant in relation to the current level of fiscal support.  Further, the support programs would continue to be administered at the federal level, as CEC has urged, since they comprise appropriate national activities, and require national direction, coordination, and dissemination. Finally, though this consolidation differs in some respects from that proposed by CEC, the differences are generally at the margins.<P>
However, CEC believes that guaranteed floors and earmarks need to be included by the Senate for particular priority areas, and CEC will continue to urge the Senate to address this issue. We base this recommendation on CEC's criteria for any consolidation which we previously shared with you.  Included among those criteria were the following: Prioritized need areas represented by the current statutory authorities, where important needs must still be met, should be maintained.  Programs with demonstrated effectiveness as they are currently structured should not be restructured simply because change is the fashion of the moment.  And, the worthy objective of greater flexibility in addressing immediate and emerging needs should not take precedent over the obligation to earmark resources for populations and activities that would otherwise be neglected.<P>
We believe that a number of programs fit these criteria, examples being the authorities under the current Part C for early childhood, children with severe disabilities, children with deaf blindness, and children and youth with serious emotional disturbance.<P>
Further, the current approach in the draft directing that the Secretary <U>may</U> direct funds into critical areas should be changed to <U>shall</U>.  CEC understands that instances occur where <U>may</U> is the appropriate approach, but we must guard against giving near total flexibility to the department respecting annual allocations and leaving too many unknowns in the annual agency budget process.  Many of the functions covered through the support authorities are critical services, and the disruption caused by on-again, off-again funding would be significant.<P>
CEC looks forward to working with the Senate Subcommittee on these and other remaining issues respecting the support programs.<P>
<B>Indexing of the Support Programs</B>.   CEC observes that precedents are now in place which affirm the principle of indexing support activities within both Part B and Part H.  Specifically, page 92 of the Senate Part B draft with respect to studies and evaluations and Page l5 of the Senate Part H draft with respect to the FICC include indexed functions.<P>
CEC believes that the time has come to index all of the IDEA support programs within Parts B and H of the Act.  We know that this is a controversial proposal in some quarters.  However, we have witnessed this year how severely these programs can be threatened in actual appropriations, which threat has precipitated a forceful national reaffirmation of the vital importance of these support functions.  These support programs are the infrastructure of the IDEA, breathing life into the quality of programs for children with disabilities.<P>
It goes without saying that funding for the Part B and H programs which provide direct services are critical.  However, to deliver these services effectively we equally need trained professionals, research, innovation and development, technology, nationwide technical assistance, and on-going information sharing.  We are reminded again that the support programs are integral to the functions of Parts B and H, and should be so designated in future budget deliberations of the Congress.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>UNDER PART H:<P>
Early Intervention.  </B>CEC endorses the recommendations made by the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities Early Childhood Workgroup.<B> </B> In addition, we question the need for the amendment to Section 679 on the uses of funds.  It is our understanding that the use of Part H funds for child identification, evaluation, and referral is already an allowable use of funds and that, in fact, many States so use their funds for this purpose.  If there is confusion about this issue, it should be clarified in report language, not the statute.  The proposed language may actually serve to limit the intended uses of funds, since it refers only to States not serving at-risk children.  A number of States serving at-risk children have narrowly defined the eligible population.  The proposed language might be interpreted as prohibiting them from using funds to evaluate and refer other at-risk children.

Dr. Pat Morrissey<BR>
Subcommitee on Disability Policy<BR>
422 Dirksen Senate Office Building<BR>
Washington, D.C.  20510<P>
Dear Dr. Morrissey:<P>
The Council for Exceptional Children commends the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy for their dedication and thoughtfulness in crafting a reauthorization proposal for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  CEC appreciates the Subcommittee's openness and accessibility to the disability and education communities in its deliberations on complex and difficult issues.  We have forwarded our comments on the overall reauthorization draft and hope that they were constructive and helpful to you.  In responding to the discipline language that the Subcommittee has recently released, we are hopeful that our comments will again be taken into serious consideration when crafting the final reauthorization bill.<P>
CEC was pleased to have been invited and taken part in numerous discussion groups on the issue of the discipline of children with disabilities.  It was beneficial to have both leaders in the disability community and in the education community to discuss a delicate and highly controversial issue as a group.  Because we are both disability advocates and primarily school-based, CEC has always promoted the interaction between these two overlapping communities.  We thank the Subcommittee for proposing the forum and providing necessary leadership.   CEC hopes that the forum model will be used throughout the reauthorization of IDEA to discuss important issues affecting the education of children with disabilities.<P>
Although CEC believes that progress has been made in addressing the discipline of children with disabilities in the Senate's draft language, we continue to have major concerns with some of the directions taken.  CEC has been in the forefront of addressing the need for amendment language to allow alternative procedures for disciplining children with disabilities who pose a safety concern in the classroom.  In our January 1995 document <I>Recommendations for the Reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act </I>we called for an expansion of the existing alternative procedures for children with disabilities who bring firearms into school, to include a 45-day alternative education setting for a child with a disability who is a "danger to self or others." <I> </I> We continue to believe that there needs to be alternative procedures for children with disabilities who bring a weapon to school or present a danger to self or others.  We commend the Subcommittee for addressing these issues; however, we strongly oppose portions of the Subcommittee's draft language that may have unintended negative consequences.  Following are our major concerns:<BR>
   <I>      </I><BR>
o<B>     Expansion of Behavior that Would Elicit Alternative Procedures.</B>  As mentioned above, CEC strongly supports alternative procedures for disciplining children with disabilities who present a danger in the classroom.  The Subcommittee language, however, would go much farther by allowing alternative procedures to be used for children with disabilities who bring drugs into the classroom or who are "seriously disruptive."  CEC believes that current provisions under IDEA provide adequate procedures for children with disabilities involved in these behaviors.  We believe that the term "seriously disruptive" is vague and could be misused to pull children with disabilities out of appropriate educational environments.  For instance, to have a successful inclusion program, schools must provide the necessary support to<BR>

teachers to include a child with a disability in a regular classroom.  Assisting a child with a disability to adapt to a new setting takes time, patience, and understanding.  We are afraid that if a placement setting is not immediately successful, the alternative discipline procedures could be used to terminate the placement precipitously.  For those students for whom the placement is clearly not appropriate, IDEA currently provides a framework for parents and schools to work together to find an appropriate setting. <BR>
<BR>
o<B>     Cessation of Educational Services</B>.  The Subcommittee language would allow the cessation of educational services for a child with a disability who is determined to be involved with dangerous weapons or drugs.  CEC opposes any language that calls for the cessation of educational services to children with disabilities.  We strongly believe that a child with a disability remains entitled to a free, appropriate public education whether or not the child is being disciplined.  In fact, to those who argue that there should not be a dual system that treats a child with a disability differently from a child without a disability in this area, we heartily agree.  No child should be expelled from school and unable to receive educational services, whether the child has a disability or not. <BR>
<BR>
o<B>     Involvement of Local School District Director of Special Education</B>.   The Subcommittee draft language would require a principal to determine if a child with a disability has been involved with dangerous weapons, drugs, behavior resulting in serious injury, or is seriously disruptive, in consultation with individuals with knowledge of the child's disability, the chair of the child's IEP team and, <I>if appropriate</I>, the agency's director of special education.  CEC strongly believes that the local school district's director of special education should be required to be a part of this determination process.  The expertise and knowledge the special education director would bring to the process will be invaluable and will promote sound and balanced decision-making.<BR>
<BR>
o<B>     Manifestation Determination</B>.  CEC is concerned with the Subcommittee's draft language addressing the  manifestation determination of a child with a disability.  Our members who are involved in such determinations currently have indicated how difficult it is to determine whether the behavior of a child with a disability stems from that disability.  It is extremely problematic, even with the best expertise, to separate the behavior of a child with a disability from the disability itself.  For this reason, CEC opposes amending the current statute to require that such a manifestation determination take place.  We join with the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities in believing that the ultimate result of attempting to make such a determination will be children with disabilities inappropriately denied educational services, as well as an escalation of wasted time, funding and other resources.<BR>
<BR>
CEC hopes that our comments and concerns will be helpful to you in crafting the final legislation.  Once again, we wish to state our admiration for the Subcommittee's leadership and endurance on this very difficult issue.  CEC  continues to believe that the final modifications to the 20 year old IDEA will be beneficial and will assist in furthering the education of children with disabilities.  We look forward to continuing to work with you on the discipline issue and any other issues involving the education of children with exceptionalities.<P>
Sincerely,<P>
<BR>
<BR>
B. Joseph Ballard<BR>
Assistant Executive Director

<CENTER>The Council For Exceptional Children's<br>
Recommendations for the Reauthorization<br>
of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act<BR>
</CENTER><B><P>
I. OUTCOMES AND EDUCATION REFORM<P>
A.     The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Should be Linked to Education Reform Efforts Implemented in Goals 2000: Educate America Act.<BR>
<BR>
Issue:  </B>On March 31, 1994, the President signed the Goals 2000: Educate America Act.  The disability community worked diligently to ensure students with special needs would be fully included in education reform efforts, including initiatives involving standards and assessments.  IDEA needs to reflect the linkage between services for students with disabilities and the overall education goals that are applicable for all students.   <P>
<B>Recommendation:  </B>A statement needs to be included in the purposes section of IDEA to reiterate Congress's intent to include children with disabilities in the Goals 2000 education reform programs.  Services available to students with disabilities through IDEA will allow all students to aspire to the high standards set in Goals 2000. <B>     <P>
B.     The Statutory Intent Should be Strengthened to Emphasize that Part B has the Objective of Improved Student Performance Along with the Guarantee of FAPE (Free, Appropriate, Public Education).</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Issue:</B>  The provisions of Part B need to place greater emphasis on the objective of improved student performance along with the guarantee of FAPE, with appropriate mechanisms for monitoring outcomes for students.  This change would allow IDEA to run in tandem with the development of voluntary national content and performance standards for all students in the recently passed Goals 2000 legislation.<BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation:</B>  Increased emphasis must be placed on outcomes for students receiving the support of special education and supplementary aids and services.  The purposes section of IDEA should be amended to emphasize the need for positive outcomes through the delivery of special education programs/services.  The annual report to Congress on IDEA should also include information on how students with disabilities do after school.   <P>
<B>II.     FLOW AND USE OF FUNDS</B><BR>
  <B><BR>
A.     The National Policy Should be Adjusted to Encourage State Special Education Funding Formulae to be Placement Neutral.</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Issue:</B>  The Federal government distributes funds for the Part B State grants on the basis of the number of children with disabilities in the State compared with the number of all children with disabilities.  The Federal formula does not differentiate funding based on a child's placement in a regular classroom or in a different setting.  Many States, however, do award funds to local education agencies based on the child's placement.  In some cases, the local education agency is allocated more funding for a child who is in a separate classroom for children with disabilities than for a child who is integrated into a regular classroom.  Unfortunately, this may act as an disincentive for placing the child in the regular classroom.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  CEC strongly believes that State funding formulae should be made to be "placement neutral."  In that context, it should be reiterated that the Federal funding formula is "placement neutral."  IDEA clearly states that to the maximum extent appropriate a child with a disability should be educated with children who do not have disabilities.  To award additional funding for placement of children with disabilities outside of the regular classroom works against the principles of IDEA.  To the other extreme, incentives should not be provided for removal of students from special education programs.  The Federal government should require States to ensure their State funding formula is "placement-neutral" in their State plan.  To do so would not prohibit placements along the continuum. <P>
B.<B>     The Current Federal Formula For Allocating Part B Funds Should Not  be Changed. <BR>
</B><BR>
<B>Issue:  </B>Funds under Part B are currently allocated to the states and to the Local Education Agencies (LEA's) and Intermediate Education Units (IEU's) within each state based upon the relative number of children receiving the support of special education and related services.  This approach was developed in an era when a very large number of children were estimated to be wholly excluded by the schools or inappropriately served without necessary special education support.  Thus, the current allocation arrangement was intended to encourage closing the gap between served and unserved.  An argument can be made that the allocation formula should become service-neutral, i.e. neither promoting nor discouraging the provision of special education services to children.  Proponents of change have suggested, as one approach, the inauguration of a funding formula state-by-state based solely on each state's relative population of all children ages three to 21 years, with a similar approach for in-state allocation.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  While CEC is philosophically supportive of changing the formula to a more census-based approach rather than a child count, we oppose changing the formula during this reauthorization.  A formula change could cause large shifts in the amount of funds states receive to assist in providing services to children with disabilities.  There would be some states that would lose funds and other states that would gain.  Thus, CEC believes the possible benefits derived from a formula change do not outweigh the disruption that could occur if formula changes are sought.  We also believe that a formula change may penalize states which have worked diligently to identify and serve all students with disabilities.  We are further concerned that a census-based formula may lead to an under-count of the population of children in urban areas who are in need of special education services. <P>
<BR>
CEC does recognize, however, the problems with using a formula that relies on a child count.  As more schools attempt to develop  inclusive programs we are seeing the potential for un-intended consequences.  One of the common service delivery models in inclusive schools is the use of co- or team-teaching.  It has been reported that when there is a special educator teaching in a regular classroom, the rate of referrals to special education decreases.  Such an outcome would appear to be both logical and desirable.  However, when funding is based on a child count the consequence of a reduced child count is reduced funding.  When funding is reduced the monies to support the special education staff working in the regular classroom are also reduced.   Clearly there is a need for research in the possible effects that  inclusion has on  reduced referral and thus, a reduction of funds for providing special education services.   <P>
<B>C.     Part B Funds Should Not be Included in "Schoolwide" Programs Authorized Under Title I of the Improving America's Schools Act (IASA).</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Issue:</B>  During the IASA reauthorization a proposal was made to include the use of IDEA, Part B funds in the schoolwide programs under Title I.  There are some in the education community who would still advocate amending IASA schoolwide provisions to include Part B funds.  The objective of allowing such funds to be used in a schoolwide program would be to assist special education students through needed schoolwide instructional improvement, with the added objectives of promoting inclusive schools and discouraging unnecessary barriers in the in-school coordination of separate federal support programs.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  While CEC recognizes the good intentions of those who would advocate allowing Part B funds to be used in schoolwide programs, we oppose such a move.  The federal government promises states 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure (APPE) to assist in the costs of educating a child with a disability.  Today, the federal government appropriates only 8 percent of the APPE.  Therefore, with limited funds to provide critical education services to children with disabilities, CEC believes we need to maintain the visible audit trail of Part B funds.  There is a need to ensure that all students receiving the support of special education continue to have full implementation of their IEP's with the limited dollars available.<P>
We also believe, however, there are some unnecessary barriers in the in-school coordination of federal programs.  The audit trail of funds should not be a barrier to serving children with disabilities in the least restrictive environment.  Where funds are used for accommodations and supplemental services "incidental benefit" to other children is something we would expect and fully support.  Such a prohibition against incidental benefit would lead to unnatural boundaries in classrooms where the intention is for students with disabilities to be full participants.  IDEA should be clarified to allow for "incidental benefit" to regular education children.  <P>

<CENTER><B>III.     ASSESSMENT FOR ELIGIBILITY</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
<B>A.</B>     <B>There Should be a Stronger Link Between Assessment and Intervention</B><P>
<B>Issue:</B>  P.L. 94-142 and subsequent reauthorizations of the Education of the Handicapped Act, including IDEA, have guaranteed a right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) for all students with disabilities.  This right has led to an emphasis in federal and state regulations on a categorical model of special education which promotes assessment for eligibility determination and classification.  Although it is imperative to continue this right to FAPE for all eligible students with disabilities, there have been a number of on-going concerns with regard to current policy and practice in the implementation of a categorical model of special education.  For example, assessment to determine categorical eligibility often does not provide information that either identifies student competence or is directly linked to appropriate interventions or supports.  In addition, many assessment measures used to determine categorical disabilities have not been found to be reliable or valid for the purpose for which they are used.  The emphasis of assessment on determination of student eligibility for services also restricts the time that professionals can allocate to other essential activities.  <BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation:  </B>Changes within IDEA should clarify the purpose and intent of the law to minimize the use of assessments to categorize children within particular categories, and instead to place an emphasis on the determination of eligibility and be based on the educational, emotional, and vocational needs of students and on assessment of student progress.  Changes in the law as well as federal and state regulations could thus deemphasize the current medical model, and clearly support a service delivery system that is driven by the identification of student competence, instructional need, and student growth.<P>
<B>B.     There is a Need to Make Statutory or Policy Changes that More Clearly Support Functional, Curriculum-based, and Performance Assessments.</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Issue:</B>  Re-conceptualization of the special education assessment process is compatible with key concepts within the general education restructuring movement, accountability, and the increased emphasis on demonstrable student outcomes.  It is also consistent with the knowledge that many of the standardized assessment instruments and procedures being used are not technically adequate for the purpose for which they are being used, nor are they linked to curriculum and instruction.  Additionally, there exist numerous professional concerns regarding the inappropriateness of such standardized tests for culturally- and linguistically-diverse exceptional children.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  CEC recognizes that functional, curriculum-based, and performance assessment instruments and procedures are currently allowed under federal law.   However, there are words and phrases used in the federal regulations that seem to reinforce and support the use of standardized instruments and procedures; e.g., the requirement that tests be valid for the purpose for which they are used, etc.  Perhaps a change in federal law is not needed; however, sometimes a re-statement of purposes of assessment and the range of possible alternatives can be beneficial to shifting "mindsets" and resulting practice.  Rather than making a change in federal law, Congress could clarify the variety of possible assessment procedures in report language.  It would seem important that inquiry regarding the special education assessment process be done at the same time that such inquiry is being carried out with other educational assessment procedures within the school restructuring process.  The emphasis of assessment should be on identifying current functioning levels, educational needs, and assessing the impact of the program and services on students.<P>
<B>C.</B>     <B>There is a Need to Clarify the 3-Year Re-evaluation Process.</B><P>
<B>Issue:  </B>The regulations governing the IDEA require a child with a disability who is receiving special education services to be re-evaluated every three years, or more frequently if conditions warrant, or if the child's parent or teacher requests an evaluation.  Although the regulations do not specify the components of the re-evaluation, they do require the procedures to be based on the initial evaluation procedures.  In practice, this has resulted in some confusion with schools conducting the same numerous assessments they initially administered to the child to find out if he or she was eligible for special education services.  <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  CEC believes every child being served under IDEA should be evaluated for services during the annual IEP process.  The three year re-evaluation, however, has often resulted in unnecessary eligibility testing of children with disabilities.  Time that could be spent on instruction and learning is currently wasted on unnecessary repetitive testing.  The regulations should be clarified to discourage schools from conducting repetitive testing unless specifically asked for by the parents or teacher.  Correspondingly, parents should be allowed to waive any particular test(s) at time of the re-evaluation.  CEC does believe, however, that a more thorough evaluation should be conducted at natural transition points for the student.  We urge Congress to consider requiring re-evaluations to be conducted at these transition points: at the 4th grade level, before entry into middle/junior high school, and before entry into high school.<P>
<B>IV.     DEFINITIONS</B><P>
<B>A.</B>     <B>Additional Diagnostic Definitions Should not be Added to the Law.</B><P>
<B>Issue:</B>  There seems to be a marked consensus in professional educational circles that no new diagnostic categories be added to the definition of the eligible population under the IDEA, with the point being made that more refined diagnoses are not appropriate for an educational law.<BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation:</B>  The contention is made that the existing categories are already too great in number, and that any further diagnostic refinements can be accommodated within the existing categories.  Too much time is spent on the sorting process; and further diagnostic categorization runs counter to the inclusive school and community movement, and to the need to focus on the whole child.<BR>
<B><P>
B.     Diagnostic Categories Should not be Required for the Primary     Grades.<P>
Issue:</B>  CEC has a strong preference for removing the federal requirement to report by diagnostic category those children receiving the support of special education.  This may, however, not be the right moment to contemplate moving to a single definition of disability that would apply to all children in determining eligibility for special education support.  We do believe, however, that a strong case can be made for allowing one broad category for the majority of children from kindergarten through the third grade.  The same logic applies which allows the schools to use one broad category for the federal preschool program for children with disabilities.  Namely, diagnostically-governed categorization for most children in their early childhood years is inappropriate and not helpful in determining appropriate instruction.  CEC defines early childhood as birth through age eight, as does IDEA, Part C, the Early Education for Children with Disabilities Program.<P>
The primary grades represent the time when a great many reading and behavior problems begin to develop; at this point they don't require designation of a diagnostic category.  These problems, however, require immediate and effective intervention by trained educators.  An increased focus on effective intervention in the early grades could avoid the need for special education support for many children in the later years.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  CEC recommends that the states be given the option of using for the majority of children ages six, seven, and eight the definition which they now have the option of using for children ages three, four, and five.  <P>
Permit us to quote that definition, Section 602(a)(1)(B) of IDEA:<P>
          (i) experiencing developmental delays, as defined by<BR>
          the State and as measured by appropriate diagnostic<BR>
          instruments and procedures, in one or more of the<BR>
          following areas: physical development, cognitive<BR>
          development, communication development, social or<BR>
          emotional development, or adaptive development; and<BR>
          (ii) who, by reason thereof, need special education<BR>
          and related services.<P>
<B>C.     The Term "Serious Emotional Disturbance" Needs to be Changed to<BR>
      "Emotional or Behavioral Disorder."</B><P>
<B>Issue:</B>  Use of the term "serious emotional disturbance" has resulted in a number of problems in efforts to serve the population of children who have emotional and behavioral challenges.  "Serious emotional disturbance" is the only one of the ten categories of children eligible to receive IDEA services that includes the term "serious."  Further, the regulatory definition of "serious emotional disturbance" is narrow, based on criteria that have never been supported by research on subtypes of children with emotional or behavioral disorders.<BR>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  If children with disorders of this nature are to be accurately identified, so that they can access appropriate education and services, the term "serious emotional disturbance" must be changed in statute to "emotional or behavioral disorder."  Characterized by behavioral or emotional responses so different from appropriate age or cultural norms that they adversely affect educational performance, "emotional or behavioral disorders" must involve exhibition of inappropriate responses in at least two different settings.  The term "emotional or behavioral disorder" is less demeaning than the current "serious emotional disturbance" and would permit more accurate identification of children and youth with disabilities who require special interventions.  This is also the recommendation of the Mental Health/Special Education Coalition.<P>
<B>V.     PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS</B><P>
<B>A.</B>     <B>The Age for the Entitlement of IDEA Services Should be Clarified.</B><P>
<B>Issue:</B>  Part B of IDEA states special education services must be provided for eligible students who are aged 3 through 21.  It is unclear as to what "through 21" really means.  This has created confusion in the provision of services.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  There is general agreement that a clarification of the eligible age for Part B services is needed.  The regulations should clearly state that the student will be eligible for services through the school year in which the student turns 21.<BR>
<B><BR>
B.</B>     <B>Mediation Should be Required as an Option for Parents Prior to the Initiation      of Due Process Hearings or Court Cases.</B><P>
<B>Issue:</B>  The due process procedures in IDEA provide necessary protections for parents of students with disabilities.  It is often, however, the only recourse parents have available to use in settling disputes with school officials.  This has sometimes led to overly legalistic and costly proceedings.  The due process procedures have in many cases caused some animosity between school officials and parents.  Parents should have the right to choose to have their differences with the school settled through mediation.  <BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation:</B>  CEC believes states should be required to make mediation available to parents.  While mediation is now available to parents in some states, it is not available to all.  By amending IDEA to require mediation be made available, all parents would be allowed to choose an alternative way of settling disputes.  While CEC strongly believes that parents have the right to proceed directly to due process proceedings, mediation should be made available to those who wish to try to work out their differences with the school.  Safeguards, however, would have to be put in place to assure parents who choose mediation that they can proceed to the formal due process procedures at any time.  Parents must also be assured that mediation does not delay the established timetable for resolution of due process procedures.      <P>
<BR>
IDEA may also need the inclusion of Sec. 513 of the Americans with Disabilities Act which reads " Where appropriate and to the extent authorized by law, the use of alternative means of dispute resolution, including settlement negotiations, conciliation, facilitation, mediation, factfinding, minitrials, and arbitration, is encouraged to resolve disputes arising under this Act."  The inclusion of this provision would help to encourage other means of conflict resolution between parents and schools.      <B> <P>
C.</B>     <B>Parents Should be Required to Meet with School Officials to Discuss Concerns      About the Evaluation Performed by School Officials Before Obtaining an            Independent Evaluation.<P>
Issue:</B>  Under IDEA, parents who disagree with the school's evaluation of a student may obtain an independent evaluation at school district expense if the school district's evaluation has been determined to be inappropriate or discriminating.  Parents' rights to an independent evaluation should be maintained.  However, if the school has an opportunity to address the concerns of parents before an independent evaluation is sought, additional funds may be saved.  In addition, by requiring parents to meet with school officials before obtaining an independent evaluation, parents can be provided an opportunity to air grievances or concerns about the school's evaluation.  A meeting of this nature would also provide school officials with an opportunity to address these concerns, and may prevent the need for an independent evaluation.<BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation:</B>  By requiring parents to meet with school officials before obtaining an independent evaluation, schools and parents are provided a chance to work together to address issues regarding the evaluation of a student.  If nothing is resolved during the meeting, parents can still obtain an independent evaluation at school district expense.  Requiring a meeting between parents and school officials facilitates communication between the two parties and may resolve any disagreement.  However, such a meeting should occur immediately when the parents indicate the desire for an independent evaluation, and should not be allowed to delay the parents right to proceed expeditiously.<BR>
<B><BR>
D.</B>     <B>Parental Notification Requirements Should be Streamlined.</B><P>
<B>Issue:</B>  The current parental notification requirements under IDEA require too much paperwork, consume large quantities of valuable instructional time and can act as a disincentive for progressive educational programs.  In addition, current approvable forms (e.g. parental rights, in special education) are too lengthy and often are not readable by the parents.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  By clarifying parental notification requirements, schools would know that they are not required to notify parents every time there is a change in the instructional strategies used to implement the individualized educational program of a child.  Teachers would be allowed the flexibility needed to vary the instructional approaches used to continue the individualization of a child's education program without the bureaucratic disincentives.  Parents will continue to be notified of any change in the child's identification, evaluation, and individualized education plan and placement but they will not be confused by the barrage of documents coming from the school for other related issues.<P>
<B>E.</B>     <B>Schools Should not Have to Reimburse State/Federal Attorneys.</B><BR>
<B><BR>
Issue:</B>  Protection and advocacy for students with disabilities is a necessary and much-needed component of IDEA.  The Federally funded Protection and Advocacy Services (P. & A.'s) that exist in every state provide families with legal representation they might not otherwise be able to afford.  The annual separate appropriation specifically for this legal representation enjoys widespread support from advocates from the disability community.  The issue raised, however, is whether state/federal attorneys, already having been publicly funded, should also be entitled to taxpayer reimbursement of legal fees at the local level.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  For state/federal attorneys to be reimbursed at the local level after already receiving public funds seems to be paying twice for the same service.  With local school districts already strapped for funds, it does not seem fair to reimburse the legal fees of someone already being paid from the public purse.  By changing the statute, schools would not have to reimburse state or federally funded attorneys but would continue to reimburse the costs of private attorneys.  <BR>
<B>F.     The Immediate Refiling of a Hearing Request Regarding the Same Issue Should be Prohibited.</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Issue:</B>  There is concern that after an expensive and time-consuming due process procedure in which a decision has been made, parents can immediately refile a hearing request regarding the same issue.  This can lead to additional costs and time spent on an issue that the school and the parents have already addressed.  After a hearing officer rules on an issue, neither party should be able to immediately start the process all over again.  Parents are allowed to appeal the decision of the hearing officer and should take this route if they feel the decision is unjust.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  A prohibition on the immediate refiling of a hearing request regarding an issue that was just decided would alleviate the unnecessary time and funds spent to decide the same issue.  IDEA guarantees adequate protection for parents by allowing parents to appeal the hearing officer's decision.     <BR>

VI.     INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAMS</B><P>
<B>A.</B>     <B>The IEP Should Be Made More Relevant to Parents, Teachers, and the            Learning Needs of Children.</B><P>
<B>Issue:</B>  Is the IEP, as it has evolved, as relevant as originally intended?  Is it a meaningful document that explains the program provided to the student?  Is it a useful document for monitoring student progress?  Is it a useful document for monitoring for state officials? Is it meaningful for parents? Is there real dialogue taking place in the development of the IEP?  There seems to be consensus that the IEP for too many students is no longer meeting the original intent of the framers of the statute and has become cumbersome and, in many instances, meaningless paperwork.  <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  CEC believes that the IEP is one of the cornerstones of IDEA.  An argument can be made that a simplified IEP, which met the original intent of the law, would be more meaningful to teachers and parents.  Such an IEP might also be a more useful document for monitoring purposes and for monitoring student progress.  A revised IEP might also promote the original intended dialogue between parents and school personnel and result in truly individualized instructional programs being developed for students with disabilities.  Of course, this revised IEP would contain the needs of the child, the special education programs and services provided, and the projected initiation and termination of these services. <P>
<B>B.       The Required Components of the IEP Document Should be Changed<BR>
     by Eliminating the Requirement for Short-Term Instructional Objectives.</B><P>
<B>Issue:</B>  When the law and its implementing regulations were originally passed, there was a strong belief that we needed to include in the IEP document not only the current level of a student's performance but also a series of annual goals and corresponding short-term instructional objectives.  There are a number of educators who strongly believe that the current focus on student performance and annual goals remain critically important within the IEP.  However, there appear to be a majority who believe the short-term instructional objectives are not as valuable as originally anticipated and could (and should) be dropped from the statute and regulations.  It appears that both teachers and parents do not gain enough value from the inclusion of short-term instructional objectives to make them worth including in the IEP process, due to the IEP teams' time and effort involved to develop them.<BR>
  <BR>
<B>Recommendation:  </B>Eliminating this requirement will significantly increase the time educators have to be able to teach, while at the same time helping significantly to reduce the labor-intensive paperwork.  Some educators believe eliminating the short-term instructional objectives will improve the communication process between parents and school officials, since they will not be required to focus on the instructional objectives that many parents find confusing and of limited value.  The IEP should focus on the annual goals (written in measurable terms) and a clear articulation on what the special education and related services will be to achieve those goals.<P>
<B>C.     IEPs Need to Specify the Extent of Student Participation in National and <BR>
     State-wide Assessments.<P>
Issue:</B>  Many children with disabilities have been uniformly excluded from participating in the various national and state-wide assessments administered to their non-disabled classmates.  Various reasons account for these exclusions including vague participation guidelines, unwillingness to accommodate exceptionalities, high-stakes incentives for exclusions, and altruistic motivation.  As a result of these exclusions, assessment results are skewed, not accurately portraying the diversity of our school populations.<P>
<B><BR>
Recommendation:</B>  The purposes of developing an IEP include team determination of relevant instructional goals and identification of specific educational services needed to achieve the stated goals.  In line with these purposes, CEC recommends the addition of a statutory requirement to the IEP - a statement describing the extent of student participation in national and state-wide assessments.  Those individuals assembled to develop an IEP would be required to consider the appropriateness of student participation, as well as to formalize the accommodations or modifications necessary for each child's assessment administration.  CEC strongly believes that such accommodations or modifications should accurately reflect those provided to the child in his or her daily instructional program.  Addition of this assessment participation statement on the IEP would do much to increase the number of students with disabilities who participate in nation-, state- and district-wide assessments, thus providing the students, the schools, and the public with more accurate data, representative of all children.<P>
<B>D.     The Individualized Education Program (IEP) should be more Family Focused,<BR>
     Particularly for Children in the Elementary Grades.<BR>
</B><BR>
<B>Issue: </B> Family involvement in the provision of special education and related services to children with disabilities has always been an essential underpinning if meaningful results for the student are to be achieved, particularly in the early childhood and elementary school programs.  Special educators have always considered the family members to be their core partners in the special education enterprise.  Further, one of the universal characteristics of school reform across the country has been the movement toward greater parent involvement in the neighborhood school, both from the standpoint of policy and overall monitoring of the school program and from the standpoint of involvement in the instructional program of their particular child.<BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation:</B>  One school of thought has been arguing that the Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) should eventually replace the IEP for all children.  We do not feel that this would be appropriate policy, since the IFSP focuses on an array of co-equal services and involves multiple agency jurisdiction.  The IEP is school-based and focuses on special education and the necessary related services in order to make that special instruction possible and meaningful.  However, we recommend that the underlying philosophy of the IFSP, which is centered on the strengths, needs, and concerns of both the child <U>and the family</U>, be built into the IEP.  Further, we recommend that recognition of the cultural and linguistic diversity of families become a focus of the IEP, in keeping with the ever more varied tapestry of American families as we enter the 21st Century.<P>
<B>E.     The Teacher(s) who Participates in the IEP Meeting Must Work<BR>
     with the Child on a Regular, Daily Basis.<P>
Issue: </B>Although the regulations clarify that the participants in a student's IEP meeting include "the child's teacher," it appears that in some cases, the teacher who attends the meeting is not necessarily one who has regular, daily contact with the student.  There are a variety of reasons for this, but one commonly cited involves situations where a child is being served in a non- public setting. <BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation: </B> In order to best represent the child's present performance and needs, the teacher or teachers who have regular, daily instructional contact with the student must be the individuals who fulfill the teacher requirement for IEP meeting participation.  CEC recommends the addition of a regulatory note further clarifying the selection of the "child's teacher" as one who works with the child on a regular daily basis.  Further, it is important to note that in many cases, more than one teacher may work with the child on a regular daily basis and be familiar with the student's disability.  When and where appropriate, more than one teacher should participate in the IEP meeting, in that multiple sources strengthen the information sharing and decision making process.  However, this recommendation should not be interpreted as requiring all teachers who have contact with the student to attend a student's IEP meeting.  Nonetheless, all teachers having contact with the student should receive copies of the IEP.<P>
<B>VII. CULTURALLY- AND LINGUISTICALLY-DIVERSE POPULATIONS</B><P>
<B>A.     The Annual Report on IDEA Should be Required to Address the Issue of Disproportionate Representation of Children From Diverse Backgrounds in Special Education.</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Issue:</B>  The question of disproportionate representation of children from culturally- and linguistically-diverse backgrounds, including limited English proficient students, in special education continues to be a major national concern.  Periodic data surveys have shown higher percentages of minority children, particularly African-American children, classified as needing special education services as compared to other children.  However, there is a notable lack of hard data and information on the extent of the over- and under-representation and the causes.  Moreover, there is little available data regarding issues of referral and identification for special education.  The "Special Studies" section of IDEA (section 618) calls for a study that examines "(i) the factors that influence the referral and placement decisions and types of placements, by disability category and English language proficiency, of minority children relative to other children, (ii) the extent to which these children are placed in regular education environments, (iii) the extent to which the parents of these children are involved in placement decisions and in the development and implementation of the IEP and the results of such participation, and (iv) the type of support provided to parents of these children that enable these parents to understand and participate in the educational process."  Unfortunately, this critical study has never been funded and policy makers still do not have necessary data on the numbers and percentages of children from diverse backgrounds in special education programs.  In order to provide information on the issue of disproportionate representation, the <I>Annual Report to Congress on the Implementation of IDEA</I> should be required to address the issue.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  By funding the study and requiring the <I>Annual Report</I> to include data on representation of culturally- and linguistically-diverse students in special education, federal policy makers, would provide educators and parents with  crucial information on the identification of children with special needs.  Regular annual information on the causes of disproportionate representation could lead to policy/practice changes that will not occur without the necessary data.<BR>
<B><BR>
B</B>.<B>     Additional Federal Resources Must Focus on Improving Instruction and<BR>
     Methodology for Educating Children with Disabilities who are Culturally- and<BR>
     Linguistically-Diverse.<P>
Issue: </B>Children with disabilities who are culturally- and linguistically-diverse have historically been subject to limited, and often inappropriate, instruction and services.  While the few longitudinal studies conducted reveal very poor post-school outcomes, including exceptionally high unemployment for this population, only limited federal resources have been targeted to research, develop, and disseminate information on proven instructional practices and methodology.<BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation: </B>In light of the challenge that lies before educators in addressing the unique needs of children and youth with disabilities who are culturally- and linguistically-diverse, CEC strongly recommends the dedication of Federal resources to focus specifically on effective instructional practices.  This could be achieved through competitive preferences in the currently authorized programs or through directed priorities, or through other strategies.  While the need for data collection and statistical/causal research in the area of culturally- and linguistically-diverse children and youth with disabilities is key, so is the development and dissemination of real-life practical strategy and methodology.  Solid, proven strategy and methodology will assure the delivery of a free, <U>appropriate</U> education to those children with specialized linguistic and cultural needs.  If, as the recent Goals 2000 education reform legislation promises, every student is to have a true opportunity to learn, the Federal government must take an active role in contributing to instruction which is appropriate and responsive to the needs of all students, including those of culturally- and linguistically-diverse backgrounds.<BR>
 <B><BR>
VIII. IDEA DISCRETIONARY PROGRAMS, PARTS C THRU G<P>
A.       Greater Flexibility Should be Built into the IDEA Support Programs,<BR>
     Parts C through G Without Resorting to Consolidation.<P>
Issue:</B> CEC wishes to affirm the vital role that the support programs operated directly by the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) have played throughout the years in providing research, development, and technical assistance which has enriched the special education enterprise and benefited children in many demonstrable ways.  Nonetheless, the contention is made that the support programs have become too fragmented over the past fifteen years, with many individually authorized programs and numerous earmarks within the individual programs.  Some feel that long history of these programs have contributed to substantial variation in activities, terminology, and funding requirements.  It is argued that is difficult for a recipient to assemble a significant funding package necessary to achieve statewide systemic change.  It is further argued that OSERS/OSEP is too constrained in meeting identified national needs by funding limitations, a situation which is further exacerbated by low appropriation levels over many years. <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  While CEC acknowledges the theoretical logic supporting a move to consolidate resources from different programs, it is important to examine such proposals from a realistic and historical perspective.  All of the discretionary authorities were established to address a genuine need; many of these needs have not yet been adequately met.  CEC recommends against moving toward an undefined consolidation of these important programs; many of the underlying concerns which support a more consolidated approach can be addressed through less drastic means. <P>
For example, we recommend that applicants be allowed to make joint applications under more than one support program as long as the Congressional intent is met for each of the individual discretionary programs involved in the joint application.  We also recommend making the language regarding eligible applicants, the types of authorized activities, etc. more consistent across the different programs which would encourage a more flexible and coherent approach for those applicants interested in seeking support under more than one program.  <P>
Finally, we recommend that as new funds become available, Congress enlarge the currently very modest authority and provide greater resources to allow OSERS/OSEP to provide individual states technical and other assistance to bring about systemic changes needed to improve outcomes for children.<P>
If, however, consolidation does proceed, CEC believes that the following criteria should apply in all consolidation deliberations:<P>
.     Prioritized need areas represented by the current statutory authorities, where important needs must still be met, should be maintained.<BR>
<BR>
.     Programs with demonstrated effectiveness as they are currently structured should not be restructured simply because change is the fashion of the moment.<BR>
<BR>
.     Any program that is deemed in some quarters to be currently unneeded or ineffective should be thoroughly and objectively examined in its current operation before alteration is proposed.<BR>
<BR>
.     The worthy objective of greater flexibility in addressing immediate and emerging needs should not take precedent over the obligation to earmark resources for populations and activities that would otherwise be neglected.<BR>
<BR>
.     All constituencies served or supported by the current discretionary authorities and sub- authorities should be fully consulted in any consolidation deliberations.<BR>
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>B.     Research Programs must Remain within Jurisdiction of the Office of Special<BR>
     Education Programs.<BR>
</B>     <BR>
<B>Issue:</B>  Research efforts in the education of individuals with disabilities, provided under IDEA, are essential to meeting the goals of the Act.  The research and demonstration projects are unlike some other Education Department research grants, in that the IDEA grants stress practical research, aimed at direct application of the data and knowledge to the delivery of special education, most importantly, at the classroom level.  These programs are administered by the Office of Special Education Programs, maintaining a strong connection between the research and the instructional components of special education and related services.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  The authority for the IDEA research components must remain in the Office of Special Education Programs.  This vital connection between instructional practice and related research must be maintained.  Removal of the research in the education of children with disabilities component from the Office of Special Education Programs would jeopardize the link to applied research connections.<BR>
<B><BR>
C.     An Authority must be Established in Part E: Research in the Education of            Individuals with Disabilities to Support Research-Based Model Demonstration      Programs which Address the Needs of Children with High-Incidence and Single-     Sensory Disabilities.<P>
Issue: </B>The current statute does not provide for development of model demonstration programs which support the translation of research findings into effective practices in the schools for students with high-incidence disabilities (specific learning disabilities) or those with single-sensory impairments (visual impairments, hearing impairments).   As a result, practices or instructional methods that are developed and tested through the research activities funded under Part E may not be used in the schools because there are no tested models or procedures for implementing them.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> A new Part E authority must be established to support the adoption of exemplary research-based models and practices in the education of children and youth with high-incidence disabilities and single-sensory disabilities.  These model demonstration programs would facilitate the smooth translation of research knowledge into practice by encouraging the development and demonstration of innovative methods, approaches, techniques, etc. appropriate to the education of children with learning disabilities and single-sensory disabilities.  The Office of Special Education Programs needs to further disseminate information on special education research projects and how to access such projects.   This authority, however, must be accompanied by sufficient appropriations to ensure funding for these activities.  Research implementation should not come at the expense of new innovations and research.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>IX. TRANSITION</B><P>
<B>A.      Lower the Age When Transition Plans are Required to be Developed.  </B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Issue: </B>Currently, a transition plan must be developed by the IEP team by the time a student is 16, or when determined appropriate for the individual, beginning at age 14 or younger.  The majority of IEP teams, however, do not approach the subject of a student's transition from school into his or her adult life until the team is required to at age 16.  Unfortunately, many students with disabilities drop out of school before they reach 16 and do not have transition plans.   <BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation: </B>Lowering the age for mandated transition planning will increase our ability to keep students with disabilities in school.  Students will be better able to see and believe that they are learning skills that will lead to a job, to further education, and to living independently.  As Congress made clear in the School-to-Work Opportunities Act, we need to prepare students much earlier for their transition from school into the work place.  CEC urges the Congress to amend IDEA to require the IEP team to develop a transition plan for students with disabilities beginning at age 14 or younger.      <P>
<B>X.     PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION AND STANDARDS<BR>
</B><BR>
<B>A.     The Primary Grant Program Under Section 631 of Part D Should be Focused on <BR>
     State-of-the-Art, Innovative Professional Preparation.<P>
Issue:     </B>CEC believes that the long-standing grant program for professional preparation (Section 631(a)(1)) which is directed primarily to the institutions of higher education (IHE's) should be maintained, and that support to the IHE's should continue to be provided directly by the U.S. Department of Education on a competitive basis.  Many believe the limited federal preparation dollars are distributed across too many programs, thus restricting the prospects for success in any single program.  Further, there is a concern that the projects funded under this priority be tied more closely to the professional needs of the school districts and other agencies providing services for children with special needs in this period of innovative reform.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>     CEC recommends that this vital competitive grant program to the IHE's and other non-profit agencies have a baseline objective of supporting <U>innovative</U> and <U>state-of-the- art</U> personnel preparation projects, primarily for high incidence disabilities.  This baseline objective should include innovative approaches in meeting the need for new, highly-qualified special education professionals in all disability areas.  CEC further recommends that projects funded should have a strong link to the research base for instruction/intervention and professional preparation and should be coordinated with designated local education agencies (LEA's) and other agencies serving infants, toddlers, and preschoolers toward the promotion of research into practice in professional preparation.  Success measures for these projects should focus on the quality of the projects and graduates and should focus on the degree to which these projects promote change and innovation in the instructional settings of the schools and other developmental settings.<BR>
Projects supported under this authority would coordinate with the Professional Development Coordinating Council (PDCC, as described under Part C) in the states where the projects occur so that the PDCC entities are informed of the potential opportunities which could accrue to the particular states.  Projects would be funded for three years, with the potential of two years of further funding for demonstration and dissemination.  Dissemination should also be state-of-the-art, utilizing such vehicles as distance learning.<P>
CEC further recommends that Part D, Section 631, continue to include a separate funding priority for the preparation of leadership in special education and the related disciplines.  Leadership should continue to be comprehensively defined to include special education supervision and administration, special education research, and special education personnel preparation; and would be directed to serving both the high and low incidence populations.  Advanced graduate, doctoral, and post-doctoral training opportunities should be supported, as well as faculty institutes which would allow faculty to upgrade their knowledge and skills.<P>
CEC also wishes to stress emphatically the importance of an innovative baseline which would emphasize the development of cultural competencies and which would promote the ethnic and cultural diversity of the professional pool.<P>
<B>B.     A Foundation Program Should be Established for the Preparation of Personnel to<BR>
     Serve Children and Youth with Low Incidence Disabilities.<P>
Issue:</B>     Critical shortages are developing in the professional workforce of those providing special education to children and youth with low incidence disabilities.  Professional preparation programs are difficult for individual states to support, given the relatively low enrollments and relatively high costs.  Further, professional preparation programs on a state-by-state basis may not be justified given the demographics of low incidence.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>     CEC believes that the unique characteristics of low incidence makes this need area a special federal responsibility.  CEC recommends the establishment of a permanent foundation program for the preparation of professionals to work with the population of children with low incidence disabilities.  Preparation programs would be supported on a long-term, sustained, basis, for at least five year periods, and would be based upon supply needs and quality of program.  CEC further recommends that this foundation program be organized on a regional basis to allow for agreements across states, perhaps utilizing the geographic divisions already existing for the regional resource centers (RRC's) authorized under Part C of the IDEA.  The same foundation program should also be directed to another area of critical emergency need, namely, related services personnel.<P>
<B>C.     The Comprehensive System of Personnel Development (CSPD), as Required in<BR>
     Parts B and H, Should be Strengthened Through Reorganization.<P>
Issue:     </B>CEC believes that there should be a thorough restructuring of the current comprehensive system of personnel development (CSPD) now required of the states.  Currently, CSPD is far too much a paper exercise between states and the federal government.  Further, while commendable activity is now occurring in some of the states, with effective technical assistance provided with federal support, the system is ragged or nearly non-existent in other states.  Importantly, nothing in federal law or regulation <U>requires</U> the maintenance of any in-state entity for the planning, development, and implementation of the CSPD.  The emphasis has been placed on planning, rather than the actual delivery of training.<P>
CEC believes that a meaningful reform of CSPD at the state level could and should become the primary vehicle in meeting professional supply and demand needs in the particular states.  But such a reform would necessitate, as an essential, the regular commitment and involvement of all interested parties.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>     In pursuit of a better-coordinated and more productive infrastructure, CEC recommends that the federal government require through the IDEA the establishment in each state of a Professional Development Coordinating Council (PDCC).<P>
<B><I><U>Authority:</B></I></U>  In order to provide maximum empowerment for the PDCC, its membership should be appointed by the chief state school officer, in consultation with the state director of special education and the head of the lead agency under Part H of IDEA.  If a separate authority exists for postsecondary education in the state (i.e. Chancellor for higher education) that individual should act jointly with the chief state school officer in the appointment of the membership.<P>
<B><I><U>Responsibilities:</B></I></U>  The PDCC would have the responsibility for planning, development, and implementation of all the components of the CSPD as determined in this reauthorization of the IDEA, as well as promotion of the quality of professionals practicing or preparing to practice, facilitation of interdisciplinary preparation, promotion of professional development in the context of school reform, and the coordination of any professional development systemwide change project in the state.<P>
The PDCC would also work with the PDCC's of other states on a regional basis as appropriate, for instance, on questions of reciprocity in certification and the pooling of professional development resources in such areas as low incidence.<P>
<B><I><U>General Education:</B></I></U>  Though its primary responsibility would be directed to the preparation of special education and related services personnel, the PDCC will assist in the preparation of general education professionals to work with children and youth with disabilities and assist in the collaborative preparation of all specialized and general education professionals by interfacing its activities with any appropriate state-level panel having responsibilities for professional development, and specifically any panel authorized for school reform purposes, including any required under "Goals 2000: Educate America Act."<P>
<B><I><U>Membership:</B></I></U>  All organizations and groups in the state involved in or having an immediate interest in pre and continuing professional preparation would be represented in the membership of the PDCC, including public and private institutions of higher education (IHE's), the state education agency, (SEA), the local and intermediate educational agencies (LEA's), the interagency coordinating council and lead agency under Part H, other appropriate state agencies, certifying bodies, parents and consumers, professional organizations, and any appropriate state and local reform entities.<P>
<B><I><U>Reporting and Accountability:</B></I></U>  The professional development plan would be given the status of a major, on-going portion of the overall state plan required under Section 613 of Part B of the IDEA and the annual application required under Section 678 of Part H of IDEA.  That plan would be developed and implemented by the PDCC, and reviewed and revised annually by the PDCC.  The state advisory committee under Part B and the interagency coordinating council under Part H would be required to submit comments at the time of original development and each annual review.  Annual review would place emphasis on progress made in meeting professional personnel needs in the state as well as lack of progress, with attention to barriers and remedies.<P>
<B><I><U>Lead Agencies and Resources:</B></I></U>  The state education agency and the lead agency under Part H would act as lead agencies to the PDCC in its planning, development, and implementation functions.  These agencies would be administering agencies for activities authorized toward implementation of the state-wide professional development plan.  Nothing, however, would preclude these agencies from taking any action toward the promotion of professional development they deemed necessary, whether approved or not by the PDCC.<P>
The current program of grants to the state education agencies under Section 632 of the IDEA would be retained and enlarged with new funds to provide greater support for the actual delivery of in-state professional development, especially at the LEA and other local agency level, under the reorganized approach.  The use of funds under this authority would be directly tied to implementation of the professional development plan as established by the PDCC.<P>
<B><I><U>Special Note:</B></I></U>  Finally, CEC recommends that the national clearinghouse on the professions in special education, authorized under Section 633(d) of IDEA, be refocused to provide information to entities involved in professional preparation and standards in each of the states.  Information provided should include professionally recognized standards, state-by-state certification and licensure standards, approaches to performance-based assessment, and alternative certification paths and strategies. <P>
<B>D.     Clarification Should be Made in the "Highest Standard" Provision Contained<BR>
     in Part B and Part H.<P>
Issue:</B>     Under the current Part B statute, Section 613, States are required to submit a State Plan that:<P>
"(14) set forth policies and procedures relating to the establishment and maintenance of standards to ensure that personnel necessary to carry out the purposes of this part are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, including--<BR>
     (a)  the establishment and maintenance of standards which are consistent with any State <BR>
     approved or recognized certification, licensing, registration, or other comparable <BR>
     requirements which apply to the area in which such personnel are providing special<BR>
     education or related services, and<P>
     (b)  to the extent such standards are not based on the highest requirements in the<BR>
     state applicable to a specific profession or discipline, the steps the State is taking to<BR>
     require the retraining or hiring of personnel that meet appropriate professional<BR>
     requirements in the State."<P>
Identical language exists in Part H, Section 676(13), in the requirements of the statewide system, except for the use of the term "early intervention services," rather than "special education or related services."<P>
CEC affirms the "highest standard" requirement contained in the law, but believes that clarifications are needed with respect to what constitute <U>appropriate</U> highest standards or requirements for professionals practicing in both early intervention and special education and related services.  CEC agrees that all professionals should have appropriate entry level academic and practical experience for delivering quality services to children with disabilities.   CEC disagrees, however, that current standards of clinical competence characterized by assumptions of a medical model of service delivery are necessarily the appropriate standard by which to judge the highest qualified standard for a service provider in an educational setting.  IDEA is a law which mandates a structure for the provision of early intervention and special education and related services.  Hence, IDEA is an educational law, not a medical or para-medical law; and standards recommended for its implementation should be specific to this purpose.<P>
Further, special education is experiencing dramatic changes in the manner in which services are delivered to children and their families, with increasing focus on natural, community, and inclusive educational settings rather than traditional clinical environments.  Appropriate emphasis is being placed on professional competencies for service delivery that are home- based/family-centered or classroom centered rather than clinic centered, and which include demonstrated cultural competencies.  Further, the failure of current certification standards to allow greater variability in the determination of specific occupational levels within disciplines has contributed seriously to current shortages in certain disciplines.  At the same time, the tremendous variance across states in the standards required for professionals in the same occupational categories often results in personnel certified in one state not meeting the certification standards in another state, resulting in unnecesssary emergency certifications and personnel shortages.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>     CEC believes that the bodies which adopt and enforce training and certification standards for educational and early intervention services, i.e. the state education agency and the lead agency under Part H, should be responsible for adopting the certificates by which highest qualified standards of professionals providing educational and early intervention services to children with disabilities under their jurisdiction are to be judged, and CEC recommends that the statute so state.  CEC further recommends that "specific profession or discipline" to which standards apply be further delineated to allow adoption of standards which apply to varied job or role levels within a specific profession or discipline.  The law should permit each SEA and lead agency under Part H to determine the specific occupational levels required to provide particular early intervention, special education, and related services and to revise or expand these levels as needed.  Further, the professions or disciplines, as well as specific sub-functions, defined by the SEA and Part H lead agency should not be limited to traditional occupational categories.<P>
At the same time that necessary flexibility is allowed to the state education agency and the lead agency under Part H to respond to emerging needs for children and families and corresponding trends in needed professional competencies, the professions and disciplines themselves have exercised and must continue to exercise a foundational role in the development of professional standards, including professional teaching standards; as well as in the academic, practicum, and supervisory requirements within a profession or discipline.  In that context, CEC recommends that the term "standards" as it appears in the language previously quoted in Parts B and H be changed to "professional standards."  Further, the word "area" in (a) should be changed to "profession or discipline" for consistency.<P>
<B>XI.     EARLY CHILDHOOD<P>
</B>The CEC Division for Early Childhood has focused on IDEA's impact on early  intervention and early childhood special education and has endorsed a package of recommendations.  CEC concurs with their recommendations which include:<P>
&iuml;     The continuation or initiation of service coordination for families of 3-5 year old children under Part B should occur if determined appropriate by the IEP/IFSP Team.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     The current census-based funding formula for distribution of federal Part H funds should be maintained.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     The noncategorical eligibility category of "developmental delay" should be extended from birth through the end of the school year in which the child turns eight years old.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     The states should be required to set outcomes and report on progress in serving under- represented populations of children and families.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Various other adjustments in national policy should occur to guarantee a seamless delivery system for children birth through eight and their families.<BR>
<BR>
This package of CEC-endorsed, DEC recommendations is available from both CEC and DEC headquarters.<P>
<BR>
<B>XII. OTHER ISSUES<BR>
</B><BR>
<B>A.</B>     <B>Statutes Need to Clarify and Strengthen Responsibilities and<BR>
     Accountability Related to Interagency Agreements.<P>
Issue:</B>  There appears to be a great disparity among and between states regarding both the degree to which interagency agreements are in effect and the extent of efficacy of those agreements.  In some states, there appear to exist effective interagency agreements, while in other states, few or no such agreements exist.  In these latter situations, the schools, as holder of the "first dollar," are assuming the responsibility for, and the cost of, most or all related and transition services.  The question centers on whether the IDEA and/or other statutes can or should be further strengthened to reflect shared responsibility, accountability and cost for wrap-around, related, and transition services.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  Changes to the IDEA statute could strengthen the requirements for development and use of interagency agreements.  While CEC recognizes that all agencies, including education, health, mental health, juvenile justice, and social services, are struggling with financial concerns, more effective interagency agreements can serve as a vehicle for sharing the fiscal, personnel, and administrative responsibilities.  Further, we know that collaboration and cooperation between agencies are an effective method of service provision to children and youth with disabilities.  Model efforts, such as those funded by the Education Department's Program for Children and Youth with Serious Emotional Disturbance and the Child and Adolescent Service System Program, or CASSP, supported by the National Institute of Mental Health, bear witness to the effectiveness of programs that "wrap" a comprehensive array of services around the child.  If all children and youth with disabilities are to be provided a genuine opportunity to benefit from a seamless delivery of multi-agency services, statutory requirements for establishing, maintaining, and monitoring interagency agreements must be strengthened.<BR>
<B><BR>
</B>We also wish to reference the current Part H provisions for interagency programs of early intervention services.  These policies and procedures provide a strong model for extending effective interagency agreements to all children and youth with disabilities.<B><P>
B.     Issues Related to School Discipline Should be Clarified, Consistent with FAPE.<P>
Issue:</B> Public and professional concern has been heightened by an increase in school violence.  As more students with disabilities are educated in general education classrooms with their nondisabled peers, teachers and school administrators are concerned that there appear to be two sets of rules regarding student's behavior and discipline.  In addition, schools are increasingly trying to take strong measures to address school violence, but believe they may not apply the same disciplinary measures to students with disabilities.<P>
Resolution of this issue will promote inclusionary practices since building administrators will be more willing to include students on their campus if they believe they retain the right to determine appropriate discipline without being in violation of FAPE.   Increased school safety will clearly benefit all students and school personnel.  It may be argued that violent behavior which is of concern today was not the type of behavior presenting itself at the time of the framing of P.L.94-142 and that different strategies are needed to address new problems.  Great care must be exercised, however, in the framing of these strategies to ensure that the original concerns of behavior related to the disability, and perhaps not under the student's control, are still appropriately addressed.  <P>
<B>Recommendations:</B> CEC strongly encourages careful examination of the issues related to school discipline and students with disabilities in a context much broader than the specific, last-resort factors of suspension and expulsion.  Efforts to foster preventive, proactive practices, appropriate behavior management, and school-community partnerships to address the special needs of children with disabilities are vital to effective, long-term solutions to the challenge of violence in the schools.   Cessation of educational services for any child is an unsound practice.  CEC recommends that Congress and the U.S. Department of Education clarify the intent of IDEA to include research, development, and dissemination of model programs and practices effective in the prevention and reduction of violent acts perpetrated by and against students with disabilities.  The Federal government must also accompany it's commitment to ensuring safety in the country's schools with adequate resources, necessary for the provision of appropriate services to children and youth with disabilities.<P>
CEC recommends that the principles of free appropriate public education (FAPE) and least restrictive environment (LRE) be the guiding forces behind any decision involving the disciplinary removal of a child with a disability from one setting and placement in another.  We clearly support the need to maintain the health and safety of students and staff in a school building; the Note under 34 CFR Section 300.513 clarifies that the so-called Stay-Put provision, as prescribed by IDEA Section 615(e)(3), does not preclude an agency from using its normal procedures for dealing with children who are endangering themselves or others.  This "danger to self or others," CEC believes, is a vital criteria upon which disciplinary action must be based, in line with the IDEA requirements of FAPE and LRE.<P>
CEC further recommends the establishment of a 45-day alternative educational setting which would be implemented upon the filing of a complaint consistent with Section 615 provisions, in cases where the child's behavior constituted a "danger to self or others."  However, placement in the 45-day alternative educational setting must, like any change of placement procedure used to move a child, under parental complaint or not, be the least restrictive placement possible for that child.   We reinforce that 45 days is a sufficient amount of time to complete an impartial due process hearing.  The IDEA requirement for a FAPE must be upheld regardless of the setting in which the child is placed; a complete cessation of services for any child with a disability is a violation of the basic tenets of IDEA.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>C.     School District Responsibilities Need to be Clarified for Students Being Served in      Private Settings (not publicly placed in private settings.)<P>
Issue:</B>  There is confusion regarding the extent of responsibility of the public schools to students who qualify for special education and related services and who are attending private schools.  In some states/LEAs, there appears to be an understanding that the student can receive benefit up to the dollar amount generated from federal dollars.  In other states/LEAs, there appears to be an understanding that the student shall receive the same benefits as he/she would if attending public schools.  In all cases, there is a lack of clarity about the definition of "genuine opportunity."<BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation:</B>  As the system is currently operating, there appears to be considerable disparity, depending on geography, as to the special education and related services benefits a student enrolled in private school is entitled to receive.  Because this places parents in the potential role of "shopping" for appropriate services, clarification and more uniform application of the statute and regulation would benefit parents and students.  Clarification would also benefit all parties by reducing the potential for litigation.<P>
Numerous OSERS policy letters, as well as the Education Department's amicus brief in the recent <U>Tribble v. Montgomery Co. (AL) Board of Education</U> Circuit Court of Appeals case have made clear, in the ED interpretation, that statute and regulation do not make an individual entitlement to services for parentally-placed private school students with disabilities.  However, under regulation school districts do have an obligation to provide benefits to a class of individuals.  Clarification of these interpretations in both statute and regulation is necessary for practical application of this provision.<P>
<B>D.     There is a Need to Focus Increased Resources on Adjudicated Children and <BR>
     Youth who have Disabilities.<P>
Issue:  </B>Over the course of one year, 450,000 delinquent youth in the US are placed in juvenile detention centers and state training schools, while another 300,000 spend some time in adult jails.  Children and youth with a variety of disabilities constitute a considerable number of those served by the juvenile corrections system.  The relationship between youth identified as having learning disabilities, mental retardation, and behavior disorders and juvenile delinquency, though not causal, is strong, up to 60% of youthful offenders in certain correctional facilities have been enrolled previously in special education programs in public schools.  Unfortunately, the numbers of incarcerated youth are growing.  The incarcerated population in state juvenile facilities increased 14% over a five year period.  Further, recent longitudinal research data reflect poor outcomes for students with disabilities who have been incarcerated, including low rates of high school completion and limited employment success.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  While the statistics appear bleak at first glance, it is important to recognize that many innovative, effective models for serving adjudicated youth with disabilities show great promise.  Practices that support meaningful special education programs in juvenile correction facilities include functional assessments, curricula and instruction; transition services; and collaborative linkages among community agencies.  However, without a greater investment in these innovative models and practices, incarcerated youth with disabilities may continue to struggle.  Additional resources must be dedicated to both research and instruction of this troubling population.  This could be achieved through competitive preferences in the currently authorized programs, or through directed priorities.<BR>

<CENTER><B>CLARIFICATION SHOULD BE MADE IN  THE "HIGHEST STANDARD" PROVISION CONTAINED IN PART B AND PART H<BR>
</CENTER><P>
<BR>
Issue:</B>     Under the current Part B statute, Section 613, States are required to submit a State Plan that:<P>
"(14) set forth policies and procedures relating to the establishment and maintenance of standards to ensure that personnel necessary to carry out the purposes of this part are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, including--<P>
     (a)  the establishment and maintenance of standards which are consistent with any State <BR>
     approved or recognized certification, licensing, registration, or other comparable <BR>
     requirements which apply to the area in which such personnel are providing special<BR>
     education or related services, and<P>
     (b)  to the extent such standards are not based on the highest requirements in the<BR>
     state applicable to a specific profession or discipline, the steps the State is taking to<BR>
     require the retraining or hiring of personnel that meet appropriate professional<BR>
     requirements in the State."<P>
Identical language exists in Part H, Section 676(13), in the requirements of the statewide system, except for the use of the term "early intervention services," rather than "special education or related services."<P>
CEC affirms the "highest standard" requirement contained in the law, but believes that clarifications are needed with respect to what constitute <U>appropriate</U> highest standards or requirements for professionals practicing in both early intervention and special education and related services.  CEC agrees that all professionals should have appropriate entry level academic and practical experience for delivering quality services to children with disabilities.   CEC disagrees, however, that current standards of clinical competence characterized by assumptions of a medical model of service delivery are necessarily the appropriate standard by which to judge the highest qualified standard for a service provider in an educational setting.  IDEA is a law which mandates a structure for the provision of early intervention and special education and related services.  Hence, IDEA is an educational law, not a medical or para-medical law; and standards recommended for its implementation should be specific to this purpose.<P>
Further, special education is experiencing dramatic changes in the manner in which services are delivered to children and their families, with increasing focus on natural, community, and inclusive educational settings rather than traditional clinical environments.  Appropriate emphasis is being placed on professional competencies for service delivery that are home- based/family-centered or classroom centered rather than clinic centered, and which include demonstrated cultural competencies.  Further, the failure of current certification standards to allow greater variability in the determination of specific occupational levels within disciplines has contributed seriously to current shortages in certain disciplines.  At the same time, the tremendous variance across states in the standards required for professionals in the same occupational categories often results in personnel certified in one state not meeting the certification standards in another state, resulting in unnecesssary emergency certifications and personnel shortages.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>     CEC believes that the bodies which adopt and enforce training and certification standards for educational and early intervention services, i.e. the state education agency and the lead agency under Part H, should be responsible for adopting the certificates by which highest qualified standards of professionals providing educational and early intervention services to children with disabilities under their jurisdiction are to be judged, and CEC recommends that the statute so state.  CEC further recommends that "specific profession or discipline" to which standards apply be further delineated to allow adoption of standards which apply to varied job or role levels within a specific profession or discipline.  The law should permit each SEA and lead agency under Part H to determine the specific occupational levels required to provide particular early intervention, special education, and related services and to revise or expand these levels as needed.  Further, the professions or disciplines, as well as specific sub-functions, defined by the SEA and Part H lead agency should not be limited to traditional occupational categories.<P>
At the same time that necessary flexibility is allowed to the state education agency and the lead agency under Part H to respond to emerging needs for children and families and corresponding trends in needed professional competencies, the professions and disciplines themselves have exercised and must continue to exercise a foundational role in the development of professional standards, including professional teaching standards; as well as in the academic, practicum, and supervisory requirements within a profession or discipline.  In that context, CEC recommends that the term "standards" as it appears in the language previously quoted in Parts B and H be changed to "professional standards."  Further, the word "area" in (a) should be changed to "profession or discipline" for consistency.

<BR>
As negotiations continue between the White House and Congress on the seven year balance budget plan contained in the reconciliation bill and on the six remaining appropriations bills, it is important that we keep up our communication with Members and the Administration on the need for education funding.  There is increasing pressure on Congress and the Administration to reach a budget deal by Christmas.  This means that this week is crucial for advocates of education funding to be heard. It is particularly important that Senator Dole (R-KS), Senator Domenici (R-NM), Representative Kasich (R-OH) and Representative Gingrich (R-GA) are contacted.            <B><U><BR>
</B></U>Before you leave for Christmas vacation, call your Representative or Senator at (202) 225-3121.  You can reach the White House by calling (202) 456-1111.  Tell them:<P>
*     I oppose Congress's proposed cuts in education programs.  Education funding is important!  The IDEA and Javits gifted program support services needed for the education of exceptional children.<BR>
<BR>
*     In my school district, children with disabilities (or gifts) have been helped through (your own success story about a child with exceptionalities). <BR>
<BR>
*     Please tell the Congressional leadership you want investment in education, not cuts in education funding.<B><U><BR>

<CENTER></U>LEGISLATIVE UPDATE<U><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
          </U>                   December 21, 1995<U><P>
FY 1996 Appropriations (the saga continues....)<P>
</B></U>As of December 18, the budget impasse between the President and Congress continues.  The second continuing resolution that funded the government through December 15 has ended and Federal departments that do not have an signed appropriation bill for FY 1996 are closed.  The closed departments include the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.  Thus, FY 1996 appropriation levels for IDEA programs and the Javits gifted program have not yet been designated.  <P>
The philosophical differences between President Clinton and the Congress, particularly the House  Republicans, continue to block progress on the reconciliation bill and the remaining appropriation legislation.  The six appropriation bills that have not been enacted contain controversial measures that have blocked their passage.  The Congressional leadership has so far refused to grant another continuing resolution to extend appropriations for programs not yet funded, without a Presidential agreement on their plan to balance the Federal budget in seven years, contained in the reconciliation bill.  With the reconciliation bill calling for drastic cuts over seven years in Medicare ($270 billion), Medicaid ($163 billion) and discretionary programs such as education ($440 billion), the President has refused to agree to the bill and the proposed cuts (please see following piece on the reconciliation bill for more information).  Clinton has responded with his own proposal for reaching a balanced budget in seven years that would cut Medicare by $124 billion, Medicaid by $54 billion and discretionary spending by $250 billion.  So far, no agreement between the two sides has been reached and thus, we are in the middle of another shutdown of those Federal agencies and programs that do not have an appropriation bill enacted. <B><U><P>
</B></U>As the attached alert indicates, this week is a crucial week for the education community.  The President and Congress are negotiating what will be the final outcome for the reconciliation package and the remaining appropriations bills.  Our education funding for FY 1996 and in future years could be decided this week as pressure mounts to have a budget agreement by Christmas.  Please stay in contact with your Congressional members on the importance of education funding.<B><U><BR>

Reauthorization of IDEA<P>
</B></U>On November 20th, the Senate released its draft bill that would reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  The draft includes several changes to IDEA.  Following is an overview of some of those changes, as well as CEC's responses to the proposals.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B><U>KEY FEATURES OF SENATE DRAFT</B></U><BR>

<B><U>CEC's RESPONSE</B></U><BR>

</CENTER><B>Definitions<BR>
</B><BR>
The Senate draft does not add new disability categories to the 13 categories already listed under IDEA.<BR>

<P>
CEC supports the Senate's decision, but urges the Subcommittee to adopt the Administration's proposal to change the term "serious emotional disturbance" to "emotional disturbance."<P>
CEC recommends the Senate allow states the option of using the term "developmental delay" for ages 3 through 8, to allow children with disabilities to be served in the primary grades without the need for the designation of a diagnostic category.  Currently, children ages 3 to 5 may be served under this term.<BR>

<B>Grants to States</B><P>
The draft proposes to: simplify eligibility requirements; increase local flexibility in the use of funds and program innovation; continue the current funding formula based on the number of students receiving special education services; and maintains the 40% average per-pupil expenditure authorization level.<BR>

<P>
CEC supports retaining the current formula for state grants.  A formula change could cause large shifts in the amount of funds states receive to assist in providing services to children with disabilities.  Also, a formula change may penalize states that have worked diligently to identify and serve all students with disabilities.<P>
CEC also supports retaining language specifying the federal commitment to children with disabilities.  Even though the federal government has never met its commitment to provide states 40% of the average per pupil expenditure for every child with a disability, it is extremely important to work towards this goal.<BR>

<B>Incidental Benefit</B><P>
The draft allows local funds to be provided to a child with a disability in a regular class, even if one or more nondisabled children benefit from those services.  The draft also allows incidental benefit to children covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.<BR>

<P>
CEC strongly supports this language, as these common sense provisions will go a long way in allowing teachers and related services personnel to provide services to IDEA eligible children without regard to the incidental benefit to other children.<BR>







<B>Re-Evaluation</B><P>
The draft stipulates that re-evaluations occur every three years OR at key transition junctures in the educational process, such as the transition from elementary school to middle or junior high school.<BR>

<P>
CEC strongly supports this stipulation, and believes that it, coupled with provisions related to situations in which additional data is not needed, will promote more useful and appropriate evaluations.<BR>

<B>Notification of School of Intention to File a Complaint</B><P>
The draft requires parents to notify the school of their intention to file a complaint at least 10 days prior to the date of filing if parents have new information or if the local education agency is unaware of the nature of the complaint.<BR>

<P>
<BR>
CEC believes this provision will assist schools and parents to work together to solve problems before the need for litigation.<BR>

<B>Mediation</B><P>
The draft requires state education agencies to provide mediation as an option to parents.<BR>

<P>
While CEC affirms the need for parents to have the support they need for mediation and a role in structuring the mediation, we are concerned that the process does not result in an adversarial situation as sometimes results in the current due process procedures.<BR>

<B>Preschool Program</B><P>
The draft retains the current formula for this program.<BR>

<P>
CEC supports the retention of the formula.  We are concerned that the coordination language does not have the 1 percent cap that is included for state-level coordination activities under the larger Part B program, and urge the Subcommittee to institute a similar cap.<BR>

<B>Support Programs</B><P>
The draft's Part D, Research and Personnel Preparation, provides a program section and budget authorization for research and innovation activities under the areas of: New Knowledge Production; Integration of Research and Practice; and Improving the Use of Professional Knowledge.  The draft also provides a program section and budget authorization for personnel preparation activities under the areas of: High Incidence Disabilities; Leadership Preparation; Low Incidence Disabilities; and Projects of National Significance.<P>
The support programs would continue to be administered at the federal level.<P>
The draft directs that the Secretary <U>may</U> direct funds into critical areas.<BR>

<P>
CEC acknowledges that the Senate provides a sound basic framework for the vital support of IDEA programs.  While the number of appropriation line-items would be reduced, proven components of the existing support programs would be retained with the overall proposed funding level constant in relation to the currently level of fiscal support.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
CEC has long proposed this continuation. <P>
<BR>
This approach should be changed to <U>shall</U>.  CEC understands that instances occur where <U>may</U> is the appropriate approach, but we must guard against giving near total flexibility to the department respecting annual allocations.  Many of the functions <BR>


covered through the support authorities are critical services, and the disruption caused by on-again, off-again funding would be significant.<BR>

<B>Indexing of the Support Programs</B><P>
The draft establishes precedents that affirm the principle of indexing support activities within both Part B and Part H.  Specifically, portions of the Part B draft with respect to studies and evaluations and portions of the Part H draft with respect to the FICC include indexed functions.<BR>

<P>
CEC believes all of the IDEA support programs should be indexed within Parts B and H of the Act. While a controversial proposal, we have witnessed this year how severely these programs can be threatened in actual appropriations, precipitating a forceful national reaffirmation of the vital importance of these support programs.<BR>

<B>Early Intervention</B><P>
The draft includes an amendment on the uses of funds, which states that "...in any State that does not provide services for at-risk infants and toddlers...to strengthen the statewide system by initiating, expanding, or improving collaborative efforts related to at-risk infants and toddlers..."<BR>

<P>
CEC questions the need for such an amendment.  It is our understanding that the use of Part H funds for child identification, evaluation, and referral is already an allowable use of funds and that, in fact, many States so use their funds for this purpose.  The proposed language may actually limit the intended uses of funds, since it refers only to States not serving at-risk children.  A number of States serving at-risk children have narrowly defined the eligible population.  The proposed language might be interpreted as prohibiting them from using funds to evaluate and refer other at-risk children.  If confusion exists, it should be clarified in report language.  <BR>

<B>Policy/Regulations</B><P>
The draft prohibits the Secretary of Education from establishing a new rule without following the public comment and review requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act.  The draft also requires the Secretary to publish in the <I>Federal Register</I> a list of correspondence from the Department of Education and include a description of the interpretation of the Department.<BR>

<P>
CEC supports both of these proposals.<BR>

<B>Personnel Standards</B><P>
The draft retains the current statute respecting personnel standards.<BR>

<P>
CEC urges the inclusion of three important modifications with respect to the "highest requirement" provisions: the statute must specifically assign responsibility for establishing and maintaining standards to the state education agency.  Further, we believe that the foundational role of the professions in setting standards is vital and would use the term "professional standards" throughout this section.  Finally, we recommend inclusion of the following language in the statute:  "Establishment and Use of Levels of Personnel Within Disciplines.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, nothing prohibits the establishment and use by the <BR>


State education agency of different levels of personnel, including paraprofessionals, within specific occupations or disciplines if the State also specifies appropriate roles and responsibilities, training, and direct and indirect supervision for each level."<BR>

<B>CSPD</B><P>
The draft retains the requirement that each state maintain a comprehensive system of personnel development. <BR>

<P>
CEC remains concerned that any personnel development plan be developed and promoted through a process that promotes linkages in each State among all involved State agencies, institutions, and organizations that are concerned with a continuing supply of qualified personnel to serve children with disabilities.  <BR>

The draft also includes the concept of in-state partnerships as a major feature of the new proposed Part C.<BR>

CEC favors the inclusion of this feature, and look forward to discussing how that concept may be specifically applied to the CSPD and will continue to encourage a Professional Development Coordinating council (PDCC) charged with the specific task of developing and implementing the in-state CSPD.<BR>


<BR>
In its draft, the Senate also addressed the issues surrounding disciplining students with disabilities.  The draft addresses not only children who bring a dangerous weapon to school, it also comments on students who use, possess or distribute drugs; or engages in a behavior that may cause serious injury.  The draft also takes a step further and addresses students who engage in serious disruptive behavior. <P>
Both the House and the Senate are expected to introduce bills early next year.  The Senate is predicting floor action by the end of March.  House staff is still planning to link the IDEA reauthorization with the unpopular Education Reform Consolidation Grant in the introduced legislation.  For  further understanding of the differences between the Administration's bill, the House and Senate draft bills, and CEC's positions, please see the updated comparison of major provisions (<B>Attachment 1</B>).  Also see <B>Attachment 2</B>, for a summary of Parts C, D, and E of the Senate's draft.<BR>

<B><U>Reconciliation Bill</B></U><P>
On December 6, President Clinton vetoed the Republican's reconciliation bill that would balance the Federal budget by the year 2002.  The package included proposed cuts in several programs including: Medicare, Medicaid, the SSI program and other social welfare programs.  The final legislation included the following proposed changes:<P>
<B>Medicaid.</B>  Many in Washington think that the disagreements between the President and the Congressional majority on Medicaid may be the most difficult points for negotiation.  Currently, there are 3 proposals.  The Republican-backed proposal (passed by the Senate/House Conference Committee) eliminates entitlements and would allow states to determine who is eligible for services and what services to offer. (Wording that suggests that entitlements would continue for children 12 and under, pregnant women, and the disabled is so weak that many consider it irrelevant.)   Federal funds would be distributed to states in the form of block grants.  This plan would save $163 billion over 7 years.  A proposal by moderate Democrats (so-called "Blue Dogs") would retain entitlements (would not utilize block grants) and would save about $65 billion over 7 years.  Neither the Republican plan nor the "Blue Dog" plan include Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment Services (EPSDT) that are widely used to reimburse costs for school and community health services for children.  The President's proposal retains entitlements (no block grants), includes EPSDT, and would save $54 billion over 7 years.  For a side-by-side comparison of the Administration's plan and the Senate/House conference plan (Republican plan), see the attached paper prepared by the National Academy on Aging (<B>Attachment 3</B>).  Also attached is a chart showing estimated state-by-state Medicaid cuts under the Republican plan (<B>Attachment 4</B>).  It must be realized that <B>all</B> of these plans will mean significant cuts.   <BR>
<BR>
<B>SSI</B>.  The legislation would have changed the eligibility requirements for low-income children with disabilities to receive services under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. In order for a child to be considered disabled under the bill, the child must have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, which results in marked and severe functional limitations, and which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than a year.  The bill would eliminate the use of the individualized functional assessment (IFA) in determining eligibility.  The legislation would also eliminate references to maladaptive behavior among medical criteria for evaluation of eligibility.  <BR>
Once a child meets the definition of disability, there is other criteria to meet before drawing benefits.  For a child under age 6, the child must have a medical impairment that severely limits the ability to function in a manner appropriate to his age and who, without special personal assistance, would require specialized care outside the home.   For a child who is aged 6 and above, the child must require personal care assistance with at least two activities of daily living, continual 24-hour supervision or monitoring to avoid causing injury or harm to self or others, or the administration of medical treatment.  If the child did not receive such assistance the child would require full-time or part-time specialized care outside the home.  Children who meet this criteria will receive 100 percent of the benefit amount.  Children who do not meet this criteria will receive 75 percent of the benefit.<BR>
<BR>
The reconciliation bill would also require the Government Accounting Office (GAO) to conduct a study on the extra expenses incurred by families with a child receiving SSI benefits.  <BR>
<BR>
     <B>Child Nutrition Programs. </B> The legislation would cut proposed funding for child<BR>
     nutrition programs by $6 billion over 7 years. <P>
Additional changes in child nutrition programs are contained in the Welfare Reform bill that Congress has passed but not yet sent to the President for his signature.  Senator Lugar (R-IN) has refused to sign the conference report because of his opposition to the changes called for in the child nutrition programs.  The propose changes would allow 22 States in FY 1996 and in succeeding years, all States, to have the option of receiving funds to carry out programs offering school breakfasts and lunches for all school children under a block grant.  Under the block grant, States will be allowed to provide their own minimum nutritional requirements for meals and  set their own income eligibility limitations but must provide access to free meals to students from families that are below 130 percent of the poverty level.<BR>
<BR>
Because President Clinton vetoed this legislation and Congress has not attempted to override the veto, these proposed cuts will not take place unless they are included in new legislation that gains Presidential approval.  It is important, however, to understand the proposed changes as Congress attempts to work out a compromise with the Administration.<BR>

<B><U>Report on Education Spending</B></U><BR>
   <BR>
The Economic Policy Institute has recently released a report titled <I>Where's the Money Gone? Changes in the Level and Composition of Education Spending.</I>  The report seeks to refute the assertion that per pupil expenditure for elementary and secondary education spending has doubled in the last quarter century and that there has been no noticeable improvement in student performance.  The document reports the findings of researchers who examined nine "typical" school districts.<P>
The study makes the case that the increases in education spending are not for  regular education expenditures and that other costs such as serving special populations are receiving most of the increases in spending.  The findings of the study show that for the assessed school districts, that the share of expenditures going to regular education decreased from 80 percent to 59 percent between 1967 and 1991.  In the same period, expenditures for special education increased from 4 percent to 17 percent.  Of new funding for education spent in 1991, the report states 26 percent went to regular education and 38 percent went to special education.  Finally, per pupil expenditures for regular education grew an average of 1 percent a year during this quarter century for a total of only 28 percent.    <P>
The study acknowledges that severely disabled students would not have been in schools at all in 1967 and would have been cared for at home or in other institutions.  The study further points out that advances in medical science have allowed children who would have died before reaching school age, to survive and attend school. The release of the report is sure to resonate in the education community.   CEC strongly believes that funding currently spent to provide children with disabilities a free, appropriate public education, results in more independent, taxpaying citizens that will substantially contribute to the welfare of society.  While the report does not suggest a realignment of funding priorities, CEC is concerned that some will see an either/or proposition between regular education and special education.  We reject that proposition; funding should be available to improve the education of all children.  CEC will continue to work to make education funding a national priority.                                                                                              <P>

<CENTER><B>FEDERAL UPDATE<U><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
How Federal Agencies Operate Under Continuing Resolutions</B></U><P>
Last week (December 11-15), the President requested that Congress pass another continuing resolution (CR) that would keep the government open until January 23rd.  By then, the President hoped that he and Congress would have passed all the parts of the 1996 budget.  As of December 18, no CR has been passed, so all federal agencies and departments without passed budgets are again closed except for essential employees.  These agencies and departments include Commerce, Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, Labor, State and Veterans affairs, Environmental Protection, and NASA.  One of the possibilities that has been discussed if no agreement is reached is for Congress and the President to pass a long-term continuing resolution until the end of 1996, allowing the voters to settle the difference in November (by voting for the party whose budget priorities they support).  Because of this possibility and the multiple continuing resolutions already utilized this fall, you may want to know more about this process.  Below is an in-depth look at how one department (education) handles paying its bills under a CR. <P>
While agencies work under a CR, they only have access to funds allocated for that period.  In the meantime, their expenses continue and bills must be paid.  Bills come in from utilities and merchants; from staff salaries; and from grants, contracts, and research funded through the agencies and departments.  Do all the bills get paid?  If not, how are priorities set?<P>
According to a U.S. Department of Education employee with expertise in these matters, payments are rarely stopped, but at times money can be delayed or temporarily reduced on a case-by-case basis.  Following are some of the steps and decisions as they are made in the Department of Education:<P>
&iuml;     Each Department receives an allocation of a certain amount of funds under a CR.  If a  CR encompasses 9% of the fiscal year, each department under the CR is allocated 9% of the funds that were authorized for the year. (The actual dollar amounts may be below authorized levels if the CR specifies the allocation of only a proportion of authorized funds.)<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     As bills are received, the Department pays as many as it can afford with the money that has been allocated under the CR.  Complete and timely payments are made as long as the total bills submitted for payment are no more than the amount allocated under the CR (9% of fiscal year budget in this case).   <BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Department employees look ahead to see if any major expenditures fall into the CR period that would result in more funds being billed than are available under the CR.  If this is the case, some payments may be delayed or payments may not be made in full until further funds are allocated.  (We have been assured that most of the time under CRs all bills are paid in full and on time.)  <BR>
 <BR>
&iuml;     In order to cut expenses at the Department to ensure that all expenses can be paid, sometimes the funding for new projects or initiatives is delayed so that continuing work can be completed.<BR>

<B><U>Federal Support for Education</B></U><P>
According to the U.S. Department of Education, President Clinton based his 7-year budget on maintaining funding for education.  He calls all Department of Education expenditures in his bill investments in America's future.  In spite of pressure from the majority party in Congress and from other federal departments and agencies whose budgets are also in doubt, President Clinton has stood firmly behind maintenance of funding for the major education programs.  Sources say that the President insists on funding all education programs at the levels he specified in his original budget.  Major ED programs are outlined below:<BR>

Attached are Department of Education fact sheets comparing federal support for education in each state under the President's proposal and under the House proposal (see <B>Attachment 5</B>). The Senate's proposal is about $3.5 billion dollars lower than the President's budget and $1.5 billion higher than the House's proposal. <BR>

<B><U>OSEP Extends Deadline for Research Grant Applications</B></U><P>
The deadline for the Field-Initiated Research Projects Competition has been extended from November 17, 1995 to March 29, 1996. The reason for this change is to allow competitors to consider any changes in funding or priorities that might be made by Congress.  There are currently proposals in Congress to severely diminish funding for these projects or eliminate them entirely.<P>

<B><U>Higher Rates of Inclusion for Students with Disabilities in NAEP</B></U><P>
The U.S. Department of Education has been working for some time with the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) to increase the number of students with disabilities included in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). This will address a long-standing problem of limited data for assessing the scholastic achievement and progress of children with disabilities. Currently, only 40% of children with disabilities are included in the NAEP.  Officials expect that proportion to increase to at least 70% in the next year.   The goal of the Department is to assess at least 98% of children with disabilities using the NAEP.     <BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Gun-Free Schools Act Update</B></U><P>
According to the U.S. Department of Education, in the year since the Gun-Free Schools Act was passed into law, 47 states and the District of Columbia have passed their own laws or enacted policies of zero tolerance for guns.  These policies and laws mandate expulsion of at least one year for students who bring guns to school.  CEC supports efforts to make schools safe for children and staff.   <P>
CEC has been active in discussions involving discipline, but does NOT support expulsion as a general practice.  Years ago, people felt that many students with disabilities were not educable, had no place in schools, and had no right to an education.  We feel that expulsion for at least a year is tantamount to giving up on students by denying them an education.  CEC does not support mandatory expulsion for ANY children, regardless of whether or not they have disabilities.   <P>
At November's National Association of State Directors of Special Education (NASDSE) Conference, Thomas Hehir, Director of the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), voiced similar concerns.  He has been credited with saying, "We don't support excluding kids from education."  <P>
<B><U>Does your school meet ADA standards?</B></U><P>
The U.S. Department of Education has published a guide that schools can use to determine their compliance with ADA.   It is entitled <I>Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act: A self- evaluation guide for public elementary and secondary schools.</I> Each school district can receive one free copy.  Additional copies are $21.00.  It can be ordered by calling the U.S. Government Printing Office at (202) 512-1800.<P>

<B><U>Results of Pilot PASS Test</B></U><P>
The Performance Assessment for Self-Sufficiency (PASS) system was developed to provide a way to collect, synthesize, and report service needs of students after they have exited the educational system.  Results of a field test on the PASS system, conducted in 1991-1992, are reported in OSEP's <I>17th Annual Report to Congress on the Implementation of IDEA</I>.  Based upon data collected from 10 states, it was found that 80% of the students with disabilities in this sample required case management services.  Of the 16 services studied, this was the most common need.  The field test also concluded that only 3% of students with disabilities did not need primary additional services.  This raises two important questions:<P>
&iuml;     Are federal, state, and local governments prepared and equipped to provide these services?<BR>
&iuml;     Can schools be said to be providing FAPE if 97% of these students have primary needs that must be addressed in order for them to function?   <BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Department Issues Its Semiannual Regulatory Agenda</B> </U><P>
Twice a year, the U.S. Department of Education publishes its regulatory agenda.  The items included in the agenda are either (a) in the proposed rulemaking stage, (b) in the final rule stage, or (c) recently completed actions. The agenda gives us an overview of the Department's current activities.  Following is a sample of regulations currently in the rulemaking process that, once implemented, will effect certain professionals and parents of children with exceptionalities.  If you would like further information about any of these, please contact Jay McIntire at (703) 264-9418.  We'll make sure you are kept up to date on any issue of specific concern to you. <P>
<I>34 CFR 099</I> <B>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act</B><BR>
Proposed changes would specify requirements regarding disclosure of information in educational files, the right of parents to review files, and the maintenance & disclosure of disciplinary files. <P>
<I>34 CFR 345</I> <B>State grants program for the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act</B><BR>
Proposed regulations are designed to implement the Act and also authorize NIDRR (National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research) to provide state grants for supporting systems change and advocacy activities for implementing comprehensive statewide programs of technology-related assistance.<P>
<I>34 CFR 371</I> <B>Vocational rehabilitation service projects for American Indians with learning disabilities</B><BR>
Proposed changes would provide greater funding continuity for effective tribal projects.<P>
<B><U>World AIDS Day, 1995</B></U><P>
President Clinton has proclaimed November 30 as World AIDS Day.  In a statement, the President noted that more than 500,000 Americans have been struck by AIDS and that more than 300,000 of these have since died.  It is estimated that each year, 10,000 to 12,000 teenagers contract HIV.  The President pointed out that more than 90% of all children with AIDS receive assistance from Medicaid and called for continued funding of the Medicaid program.  The President mentioned recent encouraging research progress and reaffirmed his commitments to battling AIDS and to offering compassion to adults and children afflicted with HIV or AIDS.<P>

<B><U>NCTM Comments</B></U><P>
Although many groups have completed curriculum standards, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' (NCTM) standards seem to be the most widely used and to have had the greatest effect on curriculum in schools.  NCTM's three volumes include <I>Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics</I>, <I>Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics</I>, and <I>Assessment Standards for School Mathematics</I>.  NCTM wants to hear your opinion on the standards and how they work (or don't work) in your schools and with your students.  They are seeking responses to three questions.  <P>
     <B>1</B>.   Do you think the Standards documents would benefit from specific clarifications,<BR>
     expansions or additions, or deletions?  (Please elaborate and be as specific as<BR>
     possible.)<P>
     <B>2</B>.   What strategies do you suggest for bringing about these changes in the Standards?      <BR>
        <B>3</B>.   What steps should NCTM take to make the ideas in the Standards more widely       used and implemented?<P>
NCTM seeks replies by January 15, 1996.  Send your comments to<I> Futures, NCTM, 1906 Association Drive, Reston, VA 22091-1593</I>.  (E-mail responses to <I>future@nctm.org</I>)  If you send comments to our friends in math education, please also send a copy to CEC's Department of Public Policy.  We want to know how NCTM's standards are working for exceptional children.  <P>
<B><U>Preventing Disabling Conditions: The Center for Disease Control & Prevention Perspective</B></U><P>
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention [of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)] has published the proceedings of its 1994 national conference on preventing disabling conditions.  The conference, which was held in September in Washington D.C., focused on the role of the private sector.  <I>Healthy People 2000</I> is HHS's plan for improving public health by the turn of the century.  This plan was started in 1987 by the U.S. Public Health Service and is made up of 300 specific objectives.  Nine of these are directly related to improving health status, reducing risk, or improving service delivery for children and youth with disabilities.  They are:<P>
&iuml;     increase the proportion of people with disabilities who engage in regular leisure time physical activity <BR>
&iuml;     decrease the proportion of people with disabilities who are overweight<BR>
&iuml;     increase the proportion of people with major depressive disorders who obtain treatment<BR>
&iuml;     provide access to quality preschool programs for all disadvantaged children & children with disabilities<BR>
&iuml;     reduce the incidence of secondary disabilities associated with head & spinal cord injuries<BR>
&iuml;     reduce trauma deaths and long-term disability (expand EMS systems and improve trauma systems)<BR>
&iuml;     increase the proportion of newborns screened for genetic disorders and the proportion receiving treatment for such disorders<BR>
&iuml;     increase to all states a service system for children with, or at risk of, chronic and disabling conditions<BR>
&iuml;     increase the proportion of people with disabilities who receive recommended clinical prevention services (screening, immunizations,...) <BR>
<BR>
The progress toward meeting these goals is widely varied, but the National Center for Health Statistics reports that 6% of the 300 objectives have been achieved.  It is likely that changes in Federal priorities will increase the variability across states.  Fortunately, 38 states and D.C. have published their own year 2000 objectives.  You may want to check and see if your state has established its goals.  If it has, find out to what extent the objectives consider the needs of children with disabilities and whether or not the state's efforts are succeeding.  If you find that the state is not meeting its health goals for these children, it may give you more leverage if the states take greater control over public health care via block grants.  If your state does not have any goals, it's time to start writing some.   (The information reported here is adapted from a chapter in CDC's proceedings based on a presentation by Drs. McGinnis & Rothstein of DHHS.) <P>
<B><U>Javits Grants for FY96</B></U><P>
As you may remember, funds for the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students' Education Program were cut by 48% in last summer's rescissions.  As a result of this setback, hard decisions had to be made by the U.S. Department of Education with respect to funding of projects.  The Department decided to continue funding the National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented.  Its organization has changed somewhat, but further work will come out under most of the same names and institutions that have produced the fine work of the last five years.  In terms of demonstration grants, top priority went to providing continuation monies for grants already underway.  (CEC's Javits grant will be completed early in 1996.)  <P>
After planning for these expenditures, there was only enough money remaining to fund one new project from the 1995 competition. Congratulations go to The College of William and Mary.  Their project, to be led by Dr. Joyce VanTassel-Baska, was judged to be the best of the crop.  In her new grant, Dr. VanTassel-Baska and her team will continue to develop curriculum.  This time, their focus will be on problem-based, multidisciplinary curricula. <P>
The good news for the field of gifted education is that, as of December 14, the President's 7-Year Balanced Budget plan includes $9,521,000 for Javits in 1996.  His plan calls for increases every year through 2002 based upon inflation.  <P>
<B><U>IDEA-Part B and Preschool grants for FY97</B></U><P>
Due to likely changes in IDEA during reauthorization, the Department of Education has decided to change the procedure for FY97 grants for certain states.  States with plans from FY94-96 will be given the option to continue operating under those plans for 1997, rather than submit new plans.  All states will need to submit the regular<I> ED Form 80-0013</I> and complete an <I>Annual Data Report</I>.  For states with fully approved Part B plans, public participation requirements for any significant changes must be met and then <B>only</B> the changes need to be submitted to the Department for approval by March 1, 1996.  States with conditional approval need to provide information demonstrating that conditions warrent full approval before the FY97 extension option can be applied. This information must be submited by May 1, 1996. For more information, see September 6th's <I>Federal Register</I> or contact Ruth Ryder at OSEP at (202) 205-9018.<BR>

<CENTER><B>MISCELLANEOUS CAN INFORMATION      </B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
<B>CAN Workshop, Summer of 1996</B> -- Well, the dates have been chosen for our next summer CAN Workshop!!!  Mark your calendars now for July 14-16, 1996; the summer Workshop will be held at the ANA Westin Hotel, 2401 M Street, NW, in Washington, D.C. (it's near Georgetown!).  We're looking forward to a very busy year in D.C.!!!<P>
<B>CAN Has Proven It Does Make a Difference!!!</B> -- If you will all think back to the beginning of this year, we informed you of the need to educate the many new members of Congress who were not familiar with the variety of issues surrounding the education of students with exceptionalities.  Among the many pieces of information DPP created in order to assist you in your endeavors, we updated our annual "Budget Book." The book, which provides information on each of the programs under IDEA, was updated to include personal success stories of students who have greatly benefited because of IDEA.  We asked you to meet with your congressmen to not only give them a copy of the book, but let them know of any state-specific information you wanted to impart.  <P>
You may ask yourselves if your visits and CEC information did any good.  Well, stop asking yourselves!!!  There have been several special education "successes" that affirm the difference that you all have made. Following are just a few:<P>
&iuml;     Unfunded Mandate Legislation -- Part of the Contract with America, the Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act, dealt with unfunded mandates.  Although there was an exception in the Act for any legislation that protected against discrimination, CEC was concerned that organizations such as the Heritage Foundation might succeed in getting IDEA included as an unfunded mandate.  Ultimately, the Heritage Foundation scaled back its criticisms of IDEA, and the final law excluded such legislation as IDEA and the ADA from its coverage.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution -- Another piece of the Contract with America would have amended the U.S. Constitution to require the Federal government to balance the budget by 2002.  While CEC supports the objective of a balanced budget amendment, we believe that we cannot afford to cut or eliminate programs that will significantly better the future of our children. The Amendment was defeated, thanks to the multitude of calls received from the field.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     FY 1995 Rescissions Bill -- The rescission package that was passed by both the House and Senate this past year would have cut $874.5 million from education programs for FY 1995 (the House had originally proposed cutting $1.7 billion!).  With the help of input from the field about these harmful cuts, President Clinton vetoed the bill. Another rescission package was ultimately passed, but cuts to education programs were considerably smaller than originally proposed.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Child Nutrition Block Grants -- The Congress proposed to consolidate federal food and nutrition programs into block grants during the past year.  Because of input from the education field about the effect block grants could have on the number of low-income children who would qualify for school breakfast and lunch under the revised programs, Congress may drop this proposal altogether!<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Proposals to eliminate or consolidate the U.S. Department of Education -- There have been several congressional proposals introduced that would either consolidate the Education Department with another cabinet-level department, or eliminate it altogether.  Because of the efforts from the education grassroots community, many congressmen still believe in the importance of a national presence in education.  <BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     The IDEA has generally had bipartisan support in both houses.  Indeed, despite our concerns, there is proof that many congressmen (freshmen and veterans alike) support federal education programs -- including the IDEA.  Nothing spells this out better than an article in "Exceptional Parent" written by Rep. Randy "Duke" Cunningham (R-CA) -- a third-term Congressman, and thus a relatively new member of the House!  In the article, entitled <I>"Special Ed Deserves Special Emphasis</I>," the Chair of the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families notes that "IDEA helps fulfill our nation's moral commitment to educating America's children with disabilities.  Education transforms individuals who were once thought to be helpless, into productive, working, taxpaying citizens."  Cunningham adds that while the cost of educating these students is considerable, "this expenditure makes excellent fiscal sense.  Our investment of time and resources into education for thse students spare the financial cost of lifetime institutionalization, which might cost from $15,000 to 80,000 a year for each child.  It also preserves the important contributions people with disabilities make to society."  We couldn't have said it better ourselves!!<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     FY 1996 Appropriations -- As you know, the House passed an appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, HHS, and Education that would cut $162 million from special purposes programs funded under IDEA, eliminating funding for 7 of the 14 support programs.  The House also appropriated only $3 million for the Javits gifted and talented program for FY 1996.  Thanks to all of your calls and letters to your Senators, the Senate appropriated $153 million more for special education than under the House bill.  Also, although the Senate bill would still cut special education $7.4 million from the FY 1995 funding level, no support programs were eliminated!!<BR>
<BR>
So, as you can see from the above examples, your phone calls, letters, and personal visits to your congressperson really do have a positive impact on legislation that effects students with exceptionalities.  Keep up your support...we still have a long way to go until IDEA is reauthorized and the funding process for our programs is completed.  But know that you are a very valuable part of this process, and we in DPP appreciate your efforts!!!

<CENTER><B>Urge Your Senator to Reauthorize IDEA This Year!!</B><BR>
<B>It may be put off until next year unless Congress hears from you!</B>  <BR>
</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
All of us in the special education field know how important the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is to ensuring that the rights of students with exceptionalities are upheld.  However, there are some members of the Senate that may not be aware of this law's great importance -- that this law provides the foundation through which the basic principles of educating students with disabilities are preserved.<P>
Because of the lack of knowledge, an enduring budget crisis, pressing legislation, and a shortened congressional schedule due to the election this year, there is a real possibility that the reauthorization of IDEA may be delayed until next year.  While Part B of IDEA that contains the State grant program and the preschool program is permanently authorized, the rest of the programs under IDEA need to be reauthorized.  The authorization for the discretionary programs expired in 1994 but was automatically extended for a year.  Without reauthorization or an extention, these programs could face an elimination of funding in the coming fiscal year.  Furthermore, critical improvements needed in Part B and other parts of IDEA would be put off for at least another year.<P>
Although staffers from the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources insist that an official reauthorizing bill will be introduced by the end of this month, they're indicating that although they've heard from the field regarding a variety of issues surrounding IDEA (discipline, IEPs, funding formulas, etc.) -- they have not gotten messages from us regarding the importance of reauthorizing the law THIS YEAR.  <P>
For those of you who have Senators that reside on the Committee, please rally your networks to contact these 16 Senators over the next few weeks and URGE THEM TO COMPLETE REAUTHORIZATION THIS YEAR!!  We need to stress that the reauthorization process has been delayed for a year already; delaying it further sends a message that the safeguards that are grounded in IDEA are simply not important.  The members of the Senate Committee are as follows:<P>

<CENTER><B>Help Save Education From Unprecedented Cuts!!!!</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
As the attached CAN-O-GRAM points out, programs that are funded by the FY 1996 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill have been existing from continuing resolution (CR) to CR, wondering under what sort of funding parameters they would be working.  This type of unsteady funding pattern -- not knowing what funding levels the programs will be operating under during the next CR -- does not allow these programs to operate at their full potential.<P>
<B>IN FACT</B>, the current CR, if extended through the entire fiscal year, represents a cut of approximately $3.1 billion for education programs -- the largest cut in education in history!!!  For IDEA programs, the cut would be equal to $40 million, or a cut of 13% in IDEA discretionary funds!!  <P>
We have until <B>March 15</B> (when the current CR expires) to stop these unprecedented cuts from going into effect for the full year.  The President and members of Congress NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU AND YOUR CAN NETWORKS -- tell them that the cuts to education funding are UNACCEPTABLE, and stress that an adequate investment in education should be of the <U>highest priority</U>!!! <P>

<CENTER></U>LEGISLATIVE UPDATE<U><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
The 4th Continuing Resolution and More Horror Stories<P>
     </B></U>On January 26, the Congress passed and the President signed legislation to extend appropriations for Departments that have not yet had appropriations bills signed into law.  Under the 4th Continuing Resolution (CR) programs under the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education are required to receive funding at the House passed level or the FY 1995 level, whichever is lower.  With the exception of 10 education programs that both the President and Congress had proposed eliminating, no program can receive less than 75 percent of the FY 1995 level.  Funding is authorized through March 15. The funding cut, if extended through the entire year, represents a cut of approximately $3.1 billion for education programs.  This would be the largest cut in education in history!!<P>
      For IDEA programs, 7 programs that were proposed to be eliminated in the House and were mostly restored by the Senate committee, are cut 25 percent through March 15.  If extended through the entire year, the cut would be equal to $40 million, or a cut of 13 percent in IDEA discretionary funds!  Because of the limit of 25 percent cut, however, the Javits gifted program is funded at $3.7 million under the current CR instead of the proposed House and Senate FY 1996 funding level of $3 million.  For a complete list of IDEA and Javits gifted appropriations, please contact DPP at (703) 264-9498.<P>
     By March 15 another CR must be passed or the education appropriations bill enacted to prevent another shutdown of the Department of Education.  Another deadline that is quickly approaching is March 1st when the federal government will go into default if a bill isn't passed that would raise the debt ceiling, according to the Administration.  It is expected that some limited agreement on appropriations could be attached to a debt ceiling bill.  Thus it is very important for our grassroots to maintain the constant drumbeat on the importance of education funding to Congress and the Administration. <P>
     Because FY 1996 appropriations have not been decided, the time line for the FY 1997 budget process has been severely pushed back.  The President is required by law to submit a budget request for FY 1997 by February 5.  Unfortunately, without the FY 1996 numbers, federal departments have been unable to project necessary spending for FY 1997.  Therefore, instead of a "line-by-line" request for each education programs, the President sent Congress a thematic statement outlining budget priorities.  The President is expected to release a more thorough budget the week of March 18.  Please see related story under EXECUTIVE BRANCH INFORMATION section of this CAN mailing entitled "<B>President's FY '97 Budget Unveiled."</B> <P>
<B><U>Reauthorization of IDEA<P>
</B></U>     Neither the House or the Senate Republicans have introduced a bill to reauthorize the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act.  The Senate is expected to introduce its bill on February 26, mark-up the bill during the month of March, and have the bill through the Senate by Memorial Day.  The House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities have not yet set a schedule for the reauthorization.<P>
     It is very important that the reauthorization of IDEA is done this year.  The authorization for IDEA discretionary programs was originally extended for a year and have now expired.  Particularly in the Senate, there is increasing concern that the reauthorization will be put off again as other pressing matters demand congressional attention.  In order to move ahead with the many improvements we would like to see in special education, CEC strongly urges Congress to reauthorize IDEA this year  (please see<B> attached Alert</B>).  The House Committee is still planning to link IDEA reauthorization legislation with a controversial education reform consolidation grant proposal.  This may delay reauthorization in the House.  CEC believes the reauthorization of IDEA has always been bipartisan in nature and that it should move through Congress quickly and independently.<P>
     Stay tuned for more information on the latest version on the reauthorization.  We will let you know as soon as possible when any new drafts (or actual bills!!) come our way.  In the meantime, please use the December CAN mailing side-by-side attachment for a comparison of the Administration bill, the Senate draft, the House draft, and CEC's position.  <BR>

Hearing on "What Works in Public Schools"<P>
</B></U>     On January 31, the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities held a hearing on "What Works in Public Schools".  The hearing was held to highlight the positive results of public education.  Chairman Goodling (R-PA) began the hearing by contending that too often Congress hears what is not working in public schools and he wanted to hear what was working.  He went on to state that the most important ingredients for a successful school are quality results and local control.  A strong local commitment to education, high academic expectations, and committed parental involvement are also necessary according to Chairman Goodling.<P>
     Testifying at the hearing were representatives from the Even Start program, a program that Chairman Goodling sponsored, Charter School representatives, the president of the Council for Chief State School Officers and others, that spoke eloquently about the successes they have seen in public education.  The consensus of the speakers echoed the sentiments of Chairman Goodling's initial remarks stressing the need for an emphasis on high standards and community and parental involvement.  A major theme from all of the speakers, however, was the need for continued professional development of our nation's teachers.  <P>
     No further education hearings are scheduled at this time.    <B><U>     <P>
<BR>
Lobbying Reform<P>
     </B></U>The lobbying reform legislation that was passed last year will require more lobbyists to register with the federal government than ever before.  Following are the guidelines you should use in deciding whether you too are a LOBBYIST and need to register:<P>
*     Lobbying firms must register.  A lobbying firm is an entity with one or more employees (including self-employed individuals) who act as lobbyists for outside clients.  A lobbying firm is exempt from registration for a particular client if its total income from that client for lobbying activities does not exceed and is not expected to exceed $5,000 in a semiannual period.<BR>
<BR>
     *     An organization employing in-house lobbyists must also register.  The organization is exempt from registration if its total expenses for lobbying activities do not exceed or are not expected to exceed $20,000 in a semiannual period.<BR>
<BR>
Registration is required no later than 45 days after a lobbyist first makes a lobbying contact or is employed or retained to do so, whichever is earlier.  Registration form LD-1 may be obtained by contacting the Senate Office of Public Records, 232 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC 20510 or calling (202) 224-0758.       <P>
<B><U>ACIR Report on Unfunded Mandates</B></U><P>
     In compliance with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 passed last year, the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR) has released a preliminary report on<I> The Role of Federal Mandates in Intergovernmental Relations</I>.  The ACIR is made up of 24 members including Secretary of Education Richard Riley; Senators Graham (FL), Kempthorne (ID), and Thomas WY); Representatives Moran (VA) and Payne (NJ); Governors Carlson (MN), Dean (VT), Leavitt (UT) and Miller (NV); and others.   <P>
     The report calls for  repealing provisions covering State and local governments in the following laws: <P>
Fair Labor Standards Act                    Family and Medical Leave Act<BR>
Occupational Safety and Health Act               <BR>
Drug and Alcohol Testing of Commercial Drivers<BR>
Metric Conversion for Plans and Specifications       <BR>
Medicaid: Boren Amendment<BR>
Required Use of Recycled Crumb Rubber<P>
     The Commission names the Clean Water Act, IDEA and ADA as other mandates that it finds are necessary because national policy goals justify their use.  However, the ACIR states that the federal share of the costs should be increased or the stringent requirements and deadlines imposed on state and local governments by these mandates should be relaxed.  The ACIR recommends retaining these mandates with modifications to accommodate budgetary and administrative constraints on State and local governments.   Concerning IDEA, the Commission specifically recommends increasing federal funding to the 40 percent authorized level or relieve States from prescriptive and costly administrative mandates.  The Commission further recommends IDEA be modified to remove funding provisions that encourage and reward the over classification and segregation of students with disabilities.  The ACIR further recommends alternative dispute resolution practices should be required, and any court challenge based on the federal law should be brought by State or federal agencies, not by individuals.<P>
     Finally, the ACIR names the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Air Act and Davis-Bacon Related Acts as mandates that are related to acceptable national policy goals but should be revised to provide greater flexibility in implementation procedures and more participation by State and local governments in development of mandate policies.  <P>
     CEC takes issue with some of the report's findings on IDEA.  While we agree that the federal government should live up to its promise of providing States 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure (APPE) for every child eligible under IDEA, we disagree with any proposal that would roll back protections for children with disabilities.  We also believe that the Commission's statements that State and local financial incentives to "label" more students as special education students are driving up the size and cost of the system are completely erroneous.  Finally, using the term "segregation" to define certain settings seems to deny the value and benefits that different placements have in providing children with a free and appropriate and public education.<P>
     We urge you to let the ACIR know what YOU think about its recommendations!!!  The ACIR is accepting public comments on the report's findings until March 15.  Send your comments to: Mr. Philip M. Dearborn, ACIR, Suite 450 South, 800 K Street, NW, Washington, DC 20575.  202/653-5540 (phone), 202/653-5429 (FAX).<P>

</CENTER><P>
President's FY97 Budget Unveiled<P>
</B></U>President Clinton was required by statute to submit a 1997 budget to Congress on February 5.  Usually, such a document is huge, with proposed expenditures for every line item in the government.  Because the 1996 budget is still not complete, and the President hoped to use it as a baseline for calculating his 1997 recommendations, he submitted a brief outline of priorities instead of the usual tome.  He plans to offer his full budget during the week of March 18.<P>
In his outline, the President wrote that his budget has two aims:<P>
&iuml;     to balance the budget in seven years; and<BR>
&iuml;     to "maintain our commitments to economic growth and to protecting the most vulnerable Americans, including senior citizens, working families, and children."<BR>
<BR>
Among the programs affecting children, the President stated his budget will reduce spending on:<P>
&iuml;     Medicaid by $124 billion;<BR>
&iuml;     welfare by $40 billion; and<BR>
&iuml;     discretionary programs by $297 billion.<BR>
<BR>
The President's budget continues to prioritize education and technology.  His outline specifically mentions the importance of investments in Head Start, Safe and Drug-Free Schools, Goals 2000, an educational technology initiative, and Americorp.  The outline also specifies expanding work-study opportunities, charter schools, and merit scholarships.  No specific funding recommendations are listed for these programs in this general document.  According to the U.S. Department of Education, the fact that Title I is not specifically mentioned does not mean that the President intends to diminish this large program, which has been targeted for major cuts in the 1996 Congressional budget.    <P>
CEC is pleased with the President's introduction of merit-based scholarships, an idea unveiled at his recent State of the Union Address to Congress.  These scholarships will serve as an incentive to some high-achieving gifted students and may also encourage some underachievers to strive more diligently.  The Administration also continues to support the reauthorization of IDEA and maintenance of funding.  The fact that it was not specifically mentioned in this document is not seen as a sign of wavering on the part of the President.  <BR>
<B><U><P>
Clinton Vetoes Welfare Bill</B></U><P>
     President Clinton vetoed the compromise welfare reform bill passed by the House and Senate.  The bill originally passed by the Senate would have ended the Federal entitlement to the poor as we know it and block-granted money to states to distribute according to their own guidelines.  The House version (and compromise version) included provisions making it even less palatable to the President, including cuts effecting disabled children, legal immigrants, and food stamp recipients.  Work continues to revise welfare reform in such a way that both Congress and the President will approve.  We'll update you on the status of this very important legislation in upcoming CAN mailings.<P>

California Eliminates Expulsion</B></U><P>
     All too often a school district's response to students who bring weapons or drugs to school or who otherwise endanger themselves and/or others has been to expel the students.  Expulsion is the equivalent of giving up on students.  When CEC began, many students with exceptionalities were given up on and received little or no education.  We don't ever want to have that happen again, for any children.  <P>
     California is taking an approach that may prove to meet the safety needs of schools without denying children the chance to meet their learning needs.  The state is devising alternative programs, so that students aren't expelled onto the streets, but are "expelled" <I>into</I> an alternative educational environment.  Districts are currently developing plans, which should be put into effect over the summer.  While other states and LEAs have devised similar programs, California's will be the largest effort of its kind.<P>
<B><U><BR>
Parent Involvement in Education</B></U><P>
     There is a great deal of talk these days about increasing the connection between parents and schools.  The parents of children with disabilities and/or gifts and talents are well-known (if not always well-loved) for their school involvement.  Look for growing local opportunities to have productive relationships with schools in addition to the PTA.  <P>
     One example of increasing parent focus is <I>Education Today</I>, a parent-oriented newsletter of the Education Publishing Group (EPG). It is distributed to hundreds of thousands of parents around the country.  Its aim is to inform parents about schools and to promote productive collaboration by parents and schools.  A Spanish version of <I>Education Today</I> also has been well received.   <P>
     EPG (with support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Mothers Against Drunk Driving [MADD], Reading Is Fundamental [RIF], American Association of School Administrators [AASA], KIDSNET, and the Challenger Center for Space Science) is in the process of developing a computer network for parents and children.  It will offer online seminars, homework help, organized access to the Internet, educational forums, and more.  For more information about EPG, call them at (617)-542-6564.<BR>

State Vocational & Rehabilitation Services Program</B></U><P>
     The U.S. Department of Education has put out its proposed regulations for state vocational & rehabilitation services programs.  These are based upon changes to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 made by 1992 and 1993 amendments.  This program supports state efforts to run "comprehensive, coordinated, effective, efficient, and accountable" programs to "assess, plan, develop, and provide" vocational rehabilitation services to persons with disabilities in order to prepare them for "gainful" employment. The overall goals and some specific regulatory plans are below.  The new regulations are more than 50 pages long, so anyone who wants detailed information should consult the December 15<I> Federal Register</I>.  Public comments are due by February 23.  The proposed regulations are designed to:<P>
&iuml;     increase the influence of persons with disabilities in the development, implementation, and evaluation of state rehabilitation plans;<BR>
&iuml;     ensure that both voc ed training and employment take place in integrated settings to whatever degree this is possible;<BR>
&iuml;     ease the process for determining eligibility for state voc ed programs<BR>
by requiring use of existing information<BR>
by instituting 60-day time limit for eligibility determinations;<BR>
&iuml;     improve and expand the quality of services<BR>
            by requiring state strategic plan<BR>
by requiring a system of personnel development<BR>
by requiring development of standards and indicators for evaluation (to be announced later); and<BR>
&iuml;     expand and improve services to certain groups of persons with disabilities<BR>
 <BR>
     The regulations seek to increase the employment outcomes of education.  An employment outcome is defined as one that is consistent with an individual's "strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice."<BR>

<B><U>Guidebook on Managed Care for People with Developmental Disabilities</B></U><P>
     HSRI (The Human Services Research Institute) and NASDDDS (The National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities) have published a guidebook on managed care.  Managed care systems are increasingly being used to care for Medicaid recipients.  Current Federal plans to limit growth of Medicaid expenses is likely to accelerate this trend.  The guidebook offers an overview of managed care, information about state usage of managed care, and an in-depth exploration on the applications and implications of managed care for people with developmental disabilities.  It also offers suggestions on developing long term support systems within a managed care system.  For further information or to purchase a copy, contact NASDDDS at (703) 683-4202.<P>

<B><U>Regulatory Reform Efforts</B></U><P>
     In 1995, efforts were made in Congress to revamp the government's role in developing and enforcing regulations.  Strategies include cutting back on mandates, limiting the quality or amount of oversight, creating cumbersome processes for writing regulation, or eliminating entirely the departments with oversight responsibilities (including the department of education).  <P>
     Citizens for Sensible Safeguards (CCS), a group of organizations representing citizen interests in education, environmental concerns, and public health and safety, is concerned that some of the proposals would result in limiting public protection.   A number of existing regulations provide safeguards for America's children of today and tomorrow, including:<P>
&iuml;     environmental protection for clean air and water;<BR>
&iuml;     antidiscriminatory laws for those with disabilities as well as those of varying racial or cultural heritage or religious belief;<BR>
&iuml;     safeguards for the food supply and for overseeing the safety of new drugs and treatments; and<BR>
&iuml;     Free Appropriate Public Education and due process for children and youth with disabilities<BR>
<BR>
     Public protection in these areas has widespread popular support, but CCS is concerned that the financial interests of private industry or others may take precedence over public protection in revising federal regulatory safeguards.  Many of these safeguards were developed because any unwise local or state action in these areas would have negative effects far outside its borders.  For example, if some states allowed dumping of waste in rivers (which would be a great financial savings to industry), people downstream would be adversely effected.  Similarly, IDEA provides assurances that students with disabilities will receive an education regardless of where they reside in the U.S.  Local districts could save a great deal of money if IDEA protections were softened or rolled back.  While it is important not to hamper growth through overzealous regulation, it may be useful for CAN members to be attentive to the effects of regulatory reform on protections for the rights of children.   <P>
<B><U><BR>
Proposed Amendments in<I> Projects With Industry</I> Regulations</B></U><P>
     The U.S. Department of Education has posted proposed changes in the Projects With Industry (PWI) program.  PWI is a grant program of the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS).  The goal of this program is to create and expand job opportunities for individuals with disabilities by establishing partnerships between grantees and private industry.  <P>
     The objectives of the revision include clarification of statutory intent, reduction of burden, enhancing accountability, and addressing certain implementation problems.  One of the major revisions involves a new selection criterion focussing on "the extent to which a project has established a working relationship with private industry."  The full text of the revisions can be found in the January 22 <I>Federal Register</I>.  Comments on the proposed revisions are due by March 22.<P>
<B><U><BR>
The National Educational Goals Report, 1995</B></U><P>
     Based upon the 1995 report, it appears that the U.S. will fail to reach any of its eight national educational goals by the year 2000.  Statistically significant improvements are few, and given the large number of analyses, it would be expected that some changes of significant magnitude would occur by chance, regardless of any intervention.  <P>
     The educational goals are broken down to 34 specific objectives.  "Significant" improvements are reported for seven of these objectives, but the probability criteria used for defining "significance" was not specified.  In contrast, the results for another seven of the objectives were "significantly" worse than when baseline data were collected.  For the other objectives, there were no significant changes or no comparative data were available.<P>
     The report also provides data on a state-by-state basis.  Some of the states that appear to be making progress on multiple goals include Colorado, Iowa, Mississippi, and Texas.  Among the states showing disappointing results are Hawaii, Maine, and Wyoming.  <P>
<BR>
<B><U>Personnel Preparation Grants</B></U><P>
     The status of federal monies for personnel preparation is in doubt.  The House has recommended eliminating the program, and the Senate has recommended funding it at the 1995 level.  Meanwhile, potential grant-seekers wonder if and when requests for proposals will be posted.  <P>
     According to a U.S. Department of Education source, they are moving forward internally with preparations for holding the grant competitions.  The process has been somewhat slowed by furloughs and by a desire to hold off competitions until it was determined that there would be money for which to compete.  Given the ongoing budget struggle, the requests for proposals (RFP) may be issued before funding is appropriated.  If competitions are held, the first would be a modified "careers" competition.  This RFP could be issued before the end of February.  The second competition would be in the low incidence area, with an RFP possible before the end of March.  There is no guarantee that either of these competitions will be held, but we remain hopeful. <P>

U.S. Supreme Courts Refuses to Review Civil Rights Case</B></U> <BR>
     The Supreme Court, by refusing to hear a case involving an alleged civil rights offense against a student with cerebral palsy, upheld a lower court ruling that the school had not taken any official action to deny the student her rights.  The case involved a girl who was seriously injured while attempting gymnastics moves in a physical education class.  The school was accused of not providing adequately trained personnel or support services to ensure FAPE in physical education.  In order to prove a civil rights case, it must be shown that there was an official policy or accepted custom that led to the denial of rights.  <P>
<B><U>Monetary damages under IDEA?</B></U><P>
     <I>W.B. vs Matula</I>, 23 IDELR (3rd U.S. Circuit).  Although no monetary damages have yet been awarded for IDEA violations, a recent ruling by the Third Circuit Court bears watching.  After finding section 504 and IDEA violations, the court found no restriction under IDEA of monetary relief.  The circuit court sent the case back to the district court for a determination of monetary or other damages.  The circuit court suggested that although monetary damages were an option, other types of relief were also available, including "compensatory education beyond a child's age of eligibility, or reimbursement for providing at private expense what should have been offered by the school...."     <BR>

<B><U>A Quick Thank You!</B></U><P>
     DPP would like to thank all of you who "rallied your troops" time and again during this most hectic year.  As we mentioned in the last update, you've done a tremendous amount to inform and education Congress on the myriad of issues that CEC is concerned with surrounding the education of students with exceptionalities.  Thank you, too, for providing us with all of the wonderful "success stories" that involve REAL students in REAL schools to share with Congressional members.  It really helps to bring home to Congress that we're talking about actual students, not fictional ones.<P>

     Along with the field, CEC is advancing in its technical capabilities too, enabling us to do a better job of keeping you informed!  By April, we expect to have up and running our own web site!!  One of the pages within that site will focus on Public Policy and Legislative/Regulatory issues.  You will be able to access this site through the Internet, and be updated on the issues we in DPP are working on at any hour of the day!!!  Even at 2:00 in the morning, if you're so inclined!!  We hope this will also become an interactive site, with CEC members sharing local-based information with each other; Division CAN Coordinators corresponding with each other; and Federations sharing their concerns and triumphs with each other!  We will give you additional information about how to access this site at the CAN meeting during Convention, as well as in upcoming CAN mailings.

The staff of the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy recently released a draft for the reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The draft includes several changes to IDEA. Following is an overview of some of those changes, as well as CEC's responses to the proposals.<P>
<CENTER><B><U>KEY FEATURES OF SENATE DRAFT</B></U><BR>

<B><U>CEC's RESPONSE</B></U><BR>

</CENTER><B>Definitions<BR>
</B><BR>
The Senate draft does not add new disability categories to the 13 categories already listed under IDEA.<BR>

<P>
CEC supports the Senate's decision, but urges the Subcommittee to adopt the Administration's proposal to change the term "serious emotional disturbance" to "emotional disturbance."<P>
CEC recommends the Senate allow states the option of using the term "developmental delay" for ages 3 through 8, to allow children with disabilities to be served in the primary grades without the need for the designation of a diagnostic category.  <I>Currently, children ages 3 to 5 may be served under this term</I>.<BR>

<B>Grants to States</B><P>
The draft proposes to: simplify eligibility requirements; increase local flexibility in the use of funds and program innovation; continue the current funding formula based on the number of students receiving special education services; and maintains the 40% average per-pupil expenditure authorization level.<BR>

<P>
CEC supports retaining the current formula for state grants.  A formula change could cause large shifts in the amount of funds states receive to assist in providing services to children with disabilities.  Also, a formula change may penalize states that have worked diligently to identify and serve all students with disabilities.<P>
CEC also supports retaining language specifying the federal commitment to children with disabilities.  Even though the federal government has never met its commitment to provide states 40% of the average per pupil expenditure for every child with a disability, it is extremely important to work towards this goal.<BR>

<B>Incidental Benefit</B><P>
The draft allows local funds to be provided to a child with a disability in a regular class, even if one or more nondisabled children benefit from those services.  The draft also allows incidental benefit to children covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.<BR>

<P>
CEC strongly supports this language, as these common sense provisions will go a long way in allowing teachers and related services personnel to provide services to IDEA eligible children without regard to the incidental benefit to other children.<BR>

<B>Re-Evaluation</B><P>
The draft stipulates that re-evaluations occur every three years OR at key transition junctures in the educational process, such as the transition from elementary school to middle or junior high school.<BR>

<P>
CEC strongly supports this stipulation, and believes that it, coupled with provisions related to situations in which additional data is not needed, will promote more useful and appropriate evaluations.<BR>



<BR>
<B>Notification of School of Intention to File a Complaint</B><P>
The draft requires parents to notify the school of their intention to file a complaint at least 10 days prior to the date of filing if parents have new information or if the local education agency is unaware of the nature of the complaint.<BR>

<P>
<BR>
<BR>
CEC believes this provision will assist schools and parents to work together to solve problems before the need for litigation.<BR>

<B>Mediation</B><P>
The draft requires secondary education agencies to provide mediation as an option to parents.<BR>

<P>
While CEC affirms the need for parents to have the support they need for mediation and a role in structuring the mediation, we are concerned that the process does not result in an adversarial situation as sometimes results in the current due process procedures.<BR>

<B>Preschool Program</B><P>
The draft retains the current formula for this program.<BR>

<P>
CEC supports the retention of the formula.  We are concerned that the coordination language does not have the 1 percent cap that is included for state-level coordination activities under the larger Part B program, and urge the Subcommittee to institute a similar cap.<BR>

<B>Support Programs</B><P>
The draft's Part D, Research and Personnel Preparation, provides a program section and budget authorization for research and innovation activities under the areas of: New Knowledge Production; Integration of Research and Practice; and Improving the Use of Professional Knowledge.  The draft also provides a program section and budget authorization for personnel preparation activities under the areas of: High Incidence Disabilities; Leadership Preparation; Low Incidence Disabilities; and Projects of National Significance.<P>
The support programs would continue to be administered at the federal level.<P>
The draft directs that the Secretary <U>may</U> direct funds into critical areas.<BR>

<P>
CEC acknowledges that the Senate provides a sound basic framework for the vital support of IDEA programs.  While the number of appropriation line-items would be reduced, proven components of the existing support programs would be retained with the overall proposed funding level constant in relation to the currently level of fiscal support.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
CEC has long proposed this continuation. <P>
<BR>
This approach should be changed to <U>shall</U>.  CEC understands that instances occur where <U>may</U> is the appropriate approach, but we must guard against giving near total flexibility to the department respecting annual allocations.  Many of the functions covered through the support authorities are critical services, and the disruption caused by on-again, off-again funding would be significant.<BR>

<B>Indexing of the Support Programs</B><P>
The draft establishes precedents that affirm the principle of indexing support activities within both Part B and Part H.  Specifically, portions of the Part B draft with respect to studies and evaluations and <BR>

<P>
CEC believes all of the IDEA support programs should be indexed within Parts B and H of the Act. While a controversial proposal, we have witnessed this year how severely these programs can be <BR>

portions of the Part H draft with respect to the FICC include indexed functions.<BR>

threatened in actual appropriations, precipitating a forceful national reaffirmation of the vital importance of these support functions.<BR>

<B>Early Intervention</B><P>
The draft includes an amendment on the uses of funds, which states that "...in any State that does not provide services for at-risk infants and toddlers...to strengthen the statewide system by initiating, expanding, or improving collaborative efforts related to at-risk infants and toddlers..."<BR>

<P>
CEC questions the need for such an amendment.  It is our understanding that the use of Part H funds for child identification, evaluation, and referral is already an allowable use of funds and that, in fact, many States so use their funds for this purpose.  The proposed language may actually limit the intended uses of funds, since it refers only to States not serving at-risk children.  A number of States serving at-risk children have narrowly defined the eligible population.  The proposed language might be interpreted as prohibiting them from using funds to evaluate and refer other at-risk children.  If confusion exists, it should be clarified in report language.  <BR>

<B>Policy/Regulations</B><P>
The draft prohibits the Secretary of Education from establishing a new rule without following the public comment and review requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act.  The draft also requires the Secretary to publish in the <I>Federal Register</I> a list of correspondence from the Department of Education and include a description of the interpretation of the Department.<BR>

<P>
CEC supports both of these proposals.<BR>

<B>Personnel Standards</B><P>
The draft retains the current statute respecting personnel standards.<BR>

<P>
CEC urges the inclusion of three important modifications with respect to the "highest requirement" provisions: the statute must specifically assign responsibility for establishing and maintaining standards to the state education agency.<BR>
Further, we believe that the foundational role of the professions in setting standards is vital and would use the term "professional standards" throughout this section.  Finally, we recommend inclusion of the following language in the statute:  "Establishment and Use of Levels of Personnel Within Disciplines.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, nothing prohibits the establishment and use by the State education agency of different levels of personnel, including paraprofessionals, within specific occupations or disciplines if the State also specifies appropriate roles and responsibilities, training, and direct and indirect supervision for each level."<BR>

<B>CSPD</B><P>
The draft retains the requirement that each state maintain a comprehensive system of personnel development. <BR>

<P>
CEC remains concerned that any personnel development plan be developed and promoted through a process that promotes linkages in each State among all involved State agencies, institutions, <BR>


and organizations that are concerned with a continuing supply of qualified personnel to serve children with disabilities.  <BR>

The draft also includes the concept of in-state partnerships as a major feature of the new proposed Part C.<BR>

CEC favors the inclusion of this feature, and look forward to discussing how that concept may be specifically applied to the CSPD and will continue to encourage a Professional Development Coordinating council (PDCC) charged with the specific task of developing and implementing the in-state CSPD.<BR>


<P>
As reported in previous CAN mailings, the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities has released two drafts on the reauthorization of IDEA, and CEC commented on these proposals as well.  It is not yet known when either house will issue an official bill; however, the disability and education communities hope that the reauthorization process will be completed by next spring.  We will keep you updated on the status of the reauthorization process.

October 11, 1995<P>
<BR>
The United States Congress<BR>
Washington, D.C.  20515<P>
Dear Conferee:<P>
On  behalf of the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), the largest professional organization of teachers, administrators and parents who are concerned with the education of children with disabilities and/or giftedness,  I am writing ask for your support for funding for special education programs.  The House appropriations bill for FY 1996 would cut special education programs by $160 million, the Senate would cut special education programs by $7.4 million.  <B>We urge conferees to accept the lesser of two evils and support the Senate funding levels for programs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).<BR>
</B><BR>
The House bill would cut $160.4 million in programs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and would wipe out funding for critical programs including: professional development, innovation and development, clearinghouses that provide information on the education of children with disabilities, early childhood education, special education technology, the regional resource centers and special studies! <P>
<B>Professional Development.</B>  With States reporting a shortage of special education teachers of more than 27,000, the need for professional development in special education has never been greater.  Every child with a disability should be educated in a school staffed by capable, well-prepared professionals.  The inclusion of more children with disabilities into the regular classroom places an additional demand on the need for quality training of our classroom teachers.  The elimination of the funding for the IDEA professional development program is short-sighted and will result in the lack of adequate training for those on the front line of education.  The Senate bill restores funding for teacher training to the FY 1995 level.  The funds for the training of teachers of special needs children should be increased, but at the very least should be frozen at the FY 1995 level.<B>  Please support special education teacher training and support the Senate funding level.</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Innovation and Development and Clearinghouses.  </B> Under the House bill, funding would also be eliminated for the Innovation and Development program under IDEA.  This program supports the backbone of research in the education of children with disabilities.  This program provides new knowledge and develops improved approaches and products to better the education of children with disabilities.  As issues regarding the education of students with disabilities shift from access to education to the quality of the education provided, it becomes increasingly imperative that there be a continual investment in research and innovation activities that help teachers improve the quality of the services to children with disabilities.  Research, however, is useless without the dissemination of the information obtained.  That is why IDEA authorizes three clearinghouses to provide current, reliable information to parents, teachers, and others on the education of children with disabilities.   The clearinghouses help translate special education research into an understandable format that can be used by parents and professionals and should be funded.  The Senate cut funding for research by $6.6 million and for the clearinghouses by $173,000.  <B>We ask that the conferees fully restore the funding for these critical programs.  Without the necessary research and dissemination we will beunable to advance our knowledge of reaching and teaching children with disabilities.</B>  <BR>
<BR>
<B>Early Childhood Education. </B> The Early Childhood Education program complements the Part H Early Intervention program and the Preschool program by developing models of best practice for preschool and early intervention programs and by improving statewide program development.  The program supports demonstration, outreach and research activities to address the special needs of children aged birth through eight that have disabilities.  It is the primary mechanism for providing families, agency administrators, and service providers with information, resources, and technical assistance in early intervention and preschool education.  The House bill would eliminate funding while the Senate bill would fully restore funding for the Early Childhood Education program.<B>  We urge you to support the Senate funding level that would restore funding for this program.</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Technology Applications.</B>  A major part of helping children with disabilities learn, is taking advantage of the current technology available to teach children with exceptional needs.  With the use of technology, children who otherwise would be unable to communicate are able to fully participate in the regular classroom.  The research and design of new technology to serve children with disabilities is of critical importance not only to future children who will benefit, but also to society who will benefit from their ability to communicate.   This is a program where a modest federal investment can make a substantial difference in the lives of children with disabilities.  The House would eliminate all funding for this program while the Senate would cut $869,000.<B>  Please fully restore funds to the IDEA technology program.       </B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Javits Gifted Program.</B>  Also cut in both the House and Senate bills is the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act,  the only federal program designed specifically to address the education of gifted and talented children.  The Javits gifted program demonstration projects also allow new ideas, practices, and services to be field-tested.  These practical, real-world tests are critical in improving practices and understanding of gifted children.  The National Center for Research and Development in the Education of Gifted and Talented Children and Youth, also funded through the Javits program, provides invaluable information on gifted education to local communities.  Cut to a FY 1996 level of $3 million in both bills, the Javits gifted program will be devastated by these cuts.<B>  We ask that the conferees restore the cuts in the Javits program to the pre-recission FY 1994 level of $9.5 million.</B><P>
The House bill would also eliminate funding for IDEA Special Studies and the Regional Resource Centers, while the Senate would cut funding.  Please support the higher level of funding in the Senate bill.<P>
<B>We urge conferees on the Appropriations bill for Labor, Health and Education to support special education programs.  It is not enough to split the difference between the House and the Senate bills on these important programs.  IDEA authorities help to train teachers of children with disabilities, provide support for crucial research in educating children with special needs and enable the dissemination of critical material.  We ask that Congress support our continuing progress in addressing the needs of children with disabilities and fully restore funding to special education <P>
Sincerely, <P>
<BR>
<BR>

Interim Executive Director<BR>
