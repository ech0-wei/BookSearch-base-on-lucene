<H2><CENTER><I>What do YOU think about Sex & the Internet?</I></CENTER></H2>
<H4>
<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_MYSEX -->
<LI>nice to know that it's here
<LI>it's over rated
<LI>Interactive
<LI>great
<LI>I like sex on the internet however there should be no child pornography and if it is found it should be abolished by force if necessary
<LI>It rules
<LI>people who tune in do so because the want to
<LI>Hey, it's safer than a condom! More fun than abstinance.
<LI>basically thought provocing
<LI>Parents/guardians should be responsible for their children.  I think that the open discussion of sex is fine. And that private discussion should remain totally private.
<LI>i feel i have a right to access adult info via the ent
<LI>There isn't too much, but rather just enough to sastify the people that want to be satisfied
<LI>it should be as free as speech i loove the sex found on the net
<LI>Sex is everywhere (Net, TV, Magazines, etc), it is the most motivational tool ever.  If you're offended by sex on the Net, then don't look at it.  Duh!
<LI>Web browsers should be equipped with a "child lockout" function wherein the web server could send a code in the header of any pornographic HTML documents which the browser would see and disallow the user access to the page if the prowser's "lockout" is enabled.  Bingo!  Lots of problems solved in one fell swoop!
<LI>An exciting facet to a larger world
<LI>I think it is valuable as long as children are not subjects
<LI>this is great, I hope it is put to good use
<LI>It's GREAT!!!
<LI>It`s great!
<LI>WANTING SOMEONE TO MASTERBATE WITH ON INTERNET 
<LI>I love the Internet.  It's one of the best places to get off.  It's given me many new and exciting ideas about sex, and made me very much more in touch with my own sexuality.  I'm looking forward to losing my virginity, I'm just waiting for the right person to come along.  (though i have given and had oral sex given to me)
<LI>its getting there
<LI>so far it did not turn me on.
<LI>I like it
<LI>love it, safe and fun and I can meet my personal sex needs
<LI>it is great
<LI>Great way to find free porn...
<LI>I hope it will improve my marriage and make my wife more open minded towards some of the other types of sex, such as threesomes and moresomes.
<LI>I think it is up to the person what he or she wants to view or get into, no one else should have the right to tell anyone person what they can or can not do
<LI>I purposely looked for an internet provider that didn't censor.  I think the Net is a great way to anonymously hook up with sexual sites and also a great way to order sexual devices without the embarassment of being seen by store clerks.  NO CENSORSHIP PLEASE!!!!
<LI>I wish I could see more of it.
<LI>A new resource of information, stories, photos etc
<LI>I like it. No one forces me to look at it, and I don,t force anyone to look at or to not look at pornography.
<LI>i think that there is no getting rid of it.
<LI>harmless
<LI>Great
<LI>I THINK IT SHOULD BE FREE TO ALL, NO MEMBERSHIP CHARGES
<LI>Why not?
<LI>Fantastic
<LI>Parents should be in charge of their children.  Not the Government or any agency.
<LI>Sex is a part of living through open communication education takes place which provides makes people more responsible sexually.
<LI>The internet is a virtual world, to reflect all portions (good and bad) of the physical world.  Sex is one of the most important aspects of human life.  It has its place on the Net, just like anything else.
<LI>I've only heard about it-no contact
<LI>Looking forward to it!
<LI>I like it.  I work, the wife works.  Schedules.  Sheeeesh.
<LI>enjoy open form and exchange with likemided others
<LI>Being in the telecommunications business, I believe that censorship is up to the individual.  It is not constitutional to censor any media.  The regulation must be individual!!!
<LI>I like to look at the pictures posted
<LI>It's fun and harmless.
<LI>There used to be tons of it, and it was good, and it was free. Now there's ten times as much talk about it, there's less of it, and most of wgat is there costs.
<LI>There need to be some kickboxing-as-sex web sites and newsgroups
<LI>internets cool sex is fuckin great
<LI>Still surfing. . .  I enjoy the open communmication
<LI>Need more hardcore porn
<LI>yer mamma
<LI>where & when?
<LI>I believe that it is the parents responsiblility to watch over their children  I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE IDEA OF THE GOVERNMENT INTERVENING AND TAKING SEX OFF THE INTERNET.  I THINK THAT WITH TELEVISION VIOLENCE, IF PARENTS DON'T LIKE WHAT THEIR KIDS ARE EXPOSED TO,THEN THEY SHOULD NOT ALLOW THEIR CHILDREN TO BE EXPOSED TO SUCH MATERIAL!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>i think its great because i wouldn't feel comfortable taking to my parents about sex so i learn this way.
<LI>It has been an enlightning experience for me
<LI>There isn't enough.
<LI>Plentiful, but too comercial.
<LI>Should be better organizated and linked
<LI>boring/shallow/makes me giggle
<LI>I love it
<LI>i think it keeps sex in the home where it should be, behind closed doors
<LI>I have no time to spend these ones!!
<LI>Whatever the medium, sex will be there. People should be able to judge for themselves and monitor their own families for their own comfort level of sexual explicitness. I am for a rating system which could make it easier for people to decide what they wan
<LI>It's there if you want it.  What isn't?  It should stay like that, too.
<LI>Sex is great most of the time, not tried on the internet tho
<LI>i like it
<LI>Could be better - not enough good free stuff
<LI>No strong feelings about sex on the internet.  Sex is a part of life and people are very interested in it so it should be available uncensored.
<LI>3 words: more, more MORE!
<LI>I think it should be uncensored but internet service providers should offer parents suggestions on how to control what their children see, as well as where they can purchase the software that censors material available on the net.
<LI>I don't hve any problems with sex ion the internet.
<LI>I believe that sex is very much a human function, but parents must take an active role in safeguarding children from sex, as they would with television, or other media.
<LI>it should be more accesable to the people who want it.
<LI>yes
<LI>I'm perverted, so I love it!
<LI>Sex on the net surpizes me how many people are so horny.
<LI>Okay if kids are not involved
<LI>FUCKING BRILLLANT
<LI>great outlet
<LI>People are too obsessed with sex. I think sex should be private with the particular parties involved.
<LI>it opes the world to the users
<LI>For many people it's an interesting new way to find more about their sexual interests, and nothing is strange anymore.. Great!
<LI>its ausome babe
<LI>I have no opinion, never looked before.
<LI>Let youths, like myself, learn about sex and sexuality via the internet before they end up in a predicament.  Easier for a youth to rummage through all of this information rather than try to ask a parent or teacher at school what something like a dental dam is for.
<LI>Fantastically accessible
<LI>I am constantly wondering why people seem to get so freaked out about this subject. BBSes and Telecommunication services have had similiar things going on for more than a decade now and society has yet to collapse.
<LI>I love it.  Its all good!
<LI>I like it
<LI>I want to see more hard core sex on the net
<LI>Ilikeit
<LI>curious, but don't know how to find it. just found this
<LI>It is great.  
<LI>I don't know too much about it because I really haven't looked.
<LI>I feel it's healthy
<LI>it costs to much
<LI>over rated, really. Some of us have areal life.
<LI>it should cotain a huge database with SS#'s so you can check for children
<LI>no comment
<LI>I think that it is good for people who are curious or embarrassed to ask certain questions.
<LI>Thank god they haven't taken it yet
<LI>Sex and pornography on the internet are no different from sex and pornography off the internet.  The immorality, pervisity, or artistic quality of these things in not so much determined by the medium as the individual taking advantage of that medium.
<LI>good!
<LI>love it and think it's good
<LI>Just like everything else on the net, lots of and easy to find for those who want it! 
<LI>great wish we had more!!!!
<LI>I think that sex and the internet has been conveniently vilified by people who are unwilling to take responsibility for their children's activities and behavior. This type of vilification is common and has been used against all forms of media by people who don't take the time and energy to be aware of their children and their children's habits and what they have access to.
<LI>interesting, a great way to find out about other people and sex
<LI>I think it is GREAT!!!
<LI>freedom is what this coutry stands for freedom and openness
<LI>It is fun.  I gets you going without having to worry about mr limpy.  Please keep it on and don't take away all of our fun.
<LI>I think that it is cool to find stuff to check out
<LI>I think that it should be easer to find and more
<LI>I think That sex is much better in real life, however, the net can sort of prepare you for relationships by having read and chatted on line stuff about it without being embaressed!
<LI>Not experience yet
<LI>i think is fine, if a person wants to look up sex let them
<LI>Harmless pastime for adults
<LI>stupid!!!!
<LI>It's cool
<LI>WE NEED MORE STORIES WITH SEXUAL CONTENT
<LI>Get the thrice-cursed government out of content. 
<LI>I like it very much.
<LI>Pretty much a non-issue. I've always been able to deal with sex and sexuality without trouble.
<LI>I believe there is actually less of it than some seem to say.
<LI>It is a wondrful thing to have an open forum for anything at all, however, children should not have access. this is a parent's job, not the state. No one should be able to tell me what I will and won't watch. It is free speech among consenting adults...
<LI>If your answer to 'protecting the children' is always to ban/regulate the 'issue of the day', you'll create a world that no adult will want to inhabit. Protect children in a more traditional way, guide and shelter them until they are ready to handle the o
<LI>I wish I could find more erotic sex stories-heterosexual  
<LI>In the US, we have a first amendment which forbids government interference with the free exchange of ideas. We need to hold their feet to the fire with regards to this God given right. Nobody is in any position to tell me what I can or cannot read, nor look at, either in print or in electronic form. People need to take responsibility for their children as regards sex on the internet. Too many people want the government to be their mommies and daddies, grow up people, take responsibility for yourselves.
<LI>Good for people that can't get any in real life
<LI>great, need more hardcore
<LI>sex is goooooooooood!!!!!!!!
<LI>it압 up to the surfer to access it or not.
<LI>an old game.
<LI>A woman is a lot more effective.
<LI>This inquiry will have no or little effect on theses issues in the legislating bodies
<LI>The public is to blame, and the public must regulate itself.  What rigth does our government have to govern a world body such as the internet?!?!
<LI>there is nothing there that can't be found at the local news stand.
<LI>I love it
<LI>internet show us good sex
<LI>funny
<LI>like it
<LI>It's cool!
<LI>I think that it promotes a healthy sex imagination.
<LI>I think it is great. I'm trying to meet a partner.
<LI>Anonymous fun
<LI>I think it's a good idea. I mean kids have to see the real world plus, it's fun for the older people.
<LI>I don't see any thing wrong with it at all. If some people don't want to view it they have a warning of what they are about to see so they can get out and go some other place and quit there bitching!!
<LI>I saw how to access sex from the national news and decided to have a look to see for myself.  I haven't seen too much yet that one wouldn't have to pay for.
<LI>blah!  it's not that great.  just more crap.  go get a life and actually fuck someone
<LI>great
<LI>i want to, so why not.The U.S. are so frigid 
<LI>I think it is great, only it is On-Line, too bad.
<LI>enjoyable
<LI>After a recent study on the internet and sex, I have written about how the services are in violation of the law and not the people.  Most of the outrageous and sick images are from overseas and that is where the main problem is located.  We have to stop the US based internet providers to giving access to those areas, but over all the internets sexual areas are a human emotion being search out.  I am however concerned with the goverment stepping in and allowing the FBI to do raids on the bases of presum
ion.  I think if someone send you a image that is of not legal, you must allow the users a means of disposial before charges.  There is no protection for the inocent receipts of such filth.  Thank you....
<LI>IT'S AGREAT OUTLET FOR A BISEXUAL MARRIED PERSON WHO WISHES TO STAY FAITHFUL TO HIS WIFE AND CURRENT STRAIGHT LIFESTYLE
<LI>its great...i think there should be no censorship. people, should be able to see whatever they want
<LI>It's like Playboy if you don't want to see it don't look at it.  If you don't want your kids seeing it don't bring it home, or keep it underlock and key.
<LI>harmless fun
<LI>it's great
<LI>Sex is extremely fun and I think it should remain on the internet
<LI>It's great.  It is useful for my school work.
<LI>I think it is a good way to communicate ideas that have been kept silent by people enforcing their own morality.
<LI>I wouldn't know it was here or have had the incilnation tro look for it but for the nightly news. They not only let me know it was here, but a demonstration on-screen of how to get here.
<LI>It gives people a chance to lose their inhibitions.
<LI>It's very interesting.  Pretty good actually.
<LI>It's one of the areas that I enjoy surfing
<LI>I think it is fine for adults.
<LI>It is an interesting and fun experience but there needs to be some way to restrict children from accessing
<LI>I've learned a lot.
<LI>I wish I could find a human
<LI>It's interesting the things that you find...not sure yet.
<LI>I think sex is wonderful and even better on the internet,  you can have sex on your lunch hour on the net and be relaxed and ready to work in the afternoon.
<LI>I think that the Internex is a good forum that can be used for individual taste to explore the many varied aspects of sex in privacy.
<LI>I like Sex and the Internet, they both keep me amused.
<LI>anus!
<LI>It's.. how can I put this.. G R E A T !
<LI>it's necesary in the net
<LI>Its there if you want it..if not,don't go to it!
<LI>I really just dont get into it...
<LI>I would like to see more of it, I just dont know where to go!
<LI>Its cool, I can be me and no one knows who I am, very few people know that I am bi, my wife and a few close friends ie people I have had sex with. So the net mets a need. 
<LI>orgasmic
<LI>wonderful
<LI>It is nice think. I Would like to find more. It helps to have fun and have nice time.
<LI>I think that people are to over pretective and should let people do what they want within reason.
<LI>The porn is erratic and hard to find, but occasionally worth the effort.
<LI>It's great
<LI>wouldnt know...never done it, just person to person for me.
<LI>I don't mind it. It's a free country & we should have the choice of either looking at it or not.
<LI>I like it!!!!
<LI>Cheezy, lotta people need to find a real OUTlet.
<LI>Sex is great, and adults should have the internet as a way to enjoy that too. However I feel that children should not be allowed near this material.
<LI>Sex is good!!!  The internet is good!!!
<LI>An opportunity to fantasize. Healthy even when outrageous.
<LI>it should be open for everyone, and if there are children at home it is work of the parents to watch that they don앖 do wrong. 
<LI>It's always fun to find new sexual innovations
<LI>exciting
<LI>Keep government, including the Radical Right and Gingrich away from the Internet!
<LI>grrreat
<LI>It's a larger marketplace for sex products than local department stores.
<LI>Adults should have open access, sites should be flagged so that children's activities can be limitted to varying degrees by their parents ( nude pics vs hard core penetration, S/M , and less accepted behaviours)
<LI>more!  more!!!  more!!!!!
<LI>I think that sex on the net is fun and enjoyable
<LI>I have no problem with sex on the Internet.  If some people are offended by sex on the net, then they should not go to those sites.
<LI>I do not mind it at all.  I do not want it banned
<LI>It seems to be way overblown by the "crusaders" that seem to feel its their god given duty to mind everyone elses business. This is America and although I do not think child  and animal type pornography  should be readily available to the net , other types of pornography is o.k.
<LI>sexual pictures
<LI>It's wrong, and if I didn't have access too it, I wouldn't do it.
<LI>I think it is a great expirence that everyone should see!
<LI>Censorship condones ignorance
<LI>Some good stuff. Other than that nothing much to talk about.
<LI>Haven't had it.
<LI>Don't waste your time when the real thing is away from the computer!
<LI>It is fun to jump online and talk, read and look at sex
<LI>Why not?  If someone is offended by something, they shouldn't go there.  Just don't try to take away the rights of those who enjoy it.
<LI>I lik it alot.
<LI>Just like the BBSes of old, there should be some method of proving age at the time of sign-up and registration.  Passwords were invented for the purpose of keeping unauthorized persons from 'sensitive' areas.  The individual web/ftp sites could install an 'age verification" feature based on the signal sent by the requester.
<LI>great but there should be better close ups of the pussy and clitoris
<LI>It's interesting -- a bunch of people hiding behind handle talking dirty and not admitting to anything...
<LI>If you are looking for it, it's out there
<LI>There should be more instructive materials that are explicit to attract readers and viewers, so that they can be more educated about their own sexuality.
<LI>I'm glad it's available
<LI>OK
<LI>I really enjoy it! I am a responsible adult & can handle it.
<LI>I think that net sex is perfectly ok....do it often!
<LI>I don't see any problem with it as long as people are able to act maturely and responsibly, personally I think it's great.
<LI>It's fine and a personal choice
<LI>it`s a good thing, it`s just pictures and stories, nobody suffer from that
<LI>I'm interested in finding a person to experiment with and or other.
<LI>it takes away embarrassment of being seen buying sexually oriented material in public. This is good.
<LI>I am for adults being allowed access to adult only services. Providers need to control access using cryptography to those that have ID certifying correct age. Then it become the local community's standard for adult entertainment.
<LI>The media hype is very unhelpful.
<LI>I don't let my son play in the street or wander through bad neighborhoods by himself; why would I let him surf alone?
<LI>I think it is really stupid that people are charging money to access some sights on the net
<LI>its great
<LI>i think it's a very healthy and inexpensive medium to explore sexually.
<LI>Good use of a Great Idea.
<LI>I like it, I love it, I want more of it
<LI>i think that it is just a fun thing to play with on the internet, and i do not see it as damamging, however, i do feel that it should not be at the disposal of very young children.  And i see  that as the parents job to censor.
<LI>If one wants to find it, it's there for the getting, on the other hand, responsible parents who are concerned about what their children see and do on the net should take the responsibility for their siblings actions instead of crying wolf.
<LI>interesting but tends to be too sleazy/commercialized
<LI>I feel sex on the net is a great idea.  It is a safe means of entertainment on a vast variety of topics.  I feel that searching through the sex sites has made me more open with my girlfriend, willing to try new things, and self-assured, knowing that there are other people out there that see things the same way
<LI>Like many areas personal responsibility is needed (children)
<LI>Providers should block any site not self-rated as "clean." Law provide punishment for sites with nudity that self-rate as clean.  This is a start.
<LI>It's great!  I love it.
<LI>I look up as many sex pics as I can find.  Some of them are pretty sick, especially the ages of say 4-17.
<LI>its not the problem people are so concerned about...
<LI>if you dont want to see it dont go looking for it and if you do find it leave.  there are and parents should use pornography stopping programs.
<LI>Give me more
<LI>I'd Like to see more of it.
<LI>Just a past time for me.  As for children getting into links with sexual content, I STRONGLY think that it should be up to the parents to monitor their childrens activities on the net.
<LI>good
<LI>New to the internet, having problems finding "hardcore" material
<LI>I'm still a virgin to the net
<LI>provides a discreet way to find information that might be embarassing to ask somebody in person
<LI>I belive it gives good information on taboo subjects with ease.
<LI>There does not appear to be much chance of someone accidentally accessing 'hard-core' pornography, but it is available for those who seek it.
<LI>It should be available if wanted or blocked if not wanted like 900 calls on the phone.
<LI>I think it really let's one know what others like.
<LI>Approproiate at any level for adults, need screen from children
<LI>it is the best thing in the net
<LI>I think it's healthy and great
<LI>NOT GOOD IDEA!!!!
<LI>It's great!
<LI>It's wonderful!  A convenient way to participate in a wholesome activity.
<LI>To everyone their own
<LI>No censoring! Concerned users shouldn't force values on others.
<LI>i wish there was more and easier to find
<LI>If you can't take the heat... Get out of the fire !!!!
<LI>Sex is ollover the world, why not in the internet too?
<LI>It's necessary
<LI>MORE OPEN SEX TO INTERNET!!!!
<LI>horny geeks started the net, and they will *always* exist. Long line the anarrchy! The only safety is to keep it too big to control...:)
<LI>Restrictions only raise the price and lower quality, they don't stop ANYTHING.  The more info you have, the more accurate your model will be.  Hiding sex creates inaccurate models of sexual activity.
<LI>The net is helping our sexually suppressed society.
<LI>we should have more of it so we can teach are kids at an early age .
<LI>Where's the hard core stuff??
<LI>weak
<LI>I think that it is blowen out of sight by the news. I have been one for three years and i have not found any big bad things. It's much to do about nothing TED
<LI>I think that the internet is a place where people can expresses themselves sexually.  Its great because people on the internet are much more open to discusion on such topics as bisexuallity and masturbation.
<LI>there is nothing on the internet that cannot be obtained just down the street.  it's cleaner than some of the real life situations
<LI>it gets me excited
<LI>There shouldn't be any regulations. but,secret passwords should be given by servers for access.
<LI>It's an easy, benign safe way to enjoy/explore sexual interests.  It should remain!!  For those with children, it is THEIR parental responsibility to protect their kids; not the responsibility of any net provider to have to protect them.
<LI>the two don't mix!!
<LI>I don't care
<LI>it's great
<LI>I wish there were more ways to post and read without exposing my email address to strangers.
<LI>I love it!  Pictures & stuff I haven'tt seen anywhere else.  A few idiots here & there, however have given a few senators the urge to play parent with the rest of us, though.
<LI>The more of it the more I enjoy.
<LI>Let it be...
<LI>I would be interested in finding something pornographic!!
<LI>it should be up to the user not the government!
<LI>Think that there should be a combination of some type rating system and a prevention method to keep younger children from 'stumbling into' a sex related site...particularly of porno type material.
<LI>Theres not enough, censorship sucks......
<LI>I think that sex on the net is just fine. I think that parents should be responsible for keeping their kids away from it, if they so please, and I think that the government should keep their noses out of where it doesn't belong--the net.
<LI>It's enjoyble and harmless  
<LI>i love it
<LI>disappointing
<LI>Stinks and yet entertaining to me.  unhealthy for kids.  Encourage immorality.  But is entertaining to me!
<LI>Sex on the net is a perfectly benign way to excite oneself.  Often times I find the material hardly erotic-well maybe, that has to do with the fact that its hard to get off behind a keyboard.
<LI>I've had net sex.  It does nothing for me.  I'd rather wait and have the real thing with the guy I fall in love with.
<LI>Cool! Keep it up
<LI>sex is great and so is the internet!
<LI>Not as good as the real thing
<LI>let it be educational,and needs constant supervision for minors
<LI>OK
<LI>I think it is great.  It gives me somrthing to do.
<LI>Like meeting at an out of the way restaurant or in the middle of a crowd, the net is just another facet of human social activity.
<LI>I love it!
<LI>sex rules! i'm masturbating right now.
<LI>disappointing, too much subcription
<LI>too commercial
<LI>Sex is great.  The internet is cool.  I want more of both.
<LI>It's such a good time!
<LI>awesome!
<LI>I think it is a very good education.
<LI>I think anyone should be able to talk about what they want on the net including sex!
<LI>I think that if a person wanted to discuss sexual activities with someone on the net or have the opportunity to read or view pictures, that is his or her business.  As for kids, parents are the ones responsible for censoring the childs activities -- not the administrators of these sex sites.  I do wish there were more ways for people who do not have the latest computer equipment to access sex areas.
<LI>no comment
<LI>is good
<LI>fine
<LI>A great way to waste time!
<LI>No comment at this time.
<LI>Sex is an important part of life, and the internetlike any other source of information, is not inherently dangerous; only "harmful" (a grey area itself) uses of this information are dangerous.
<LI>KEEP IT!!!
<LI>I'm still learning about it
<LI>I am 67 years old, it has renewed my sexual interest and activity with my wife
<LI>1000000 sexual urges randomly thrown together; who can tolerate it all?
<LI>super
<LI>1000000 sexual urges randomly thrown together; who can tolerate it all?
<LI>I love it!  
<LI>More the Merrier!! Truly, we need to get government out, guardians to take responsibility, and people to be mature.  We don't need little brother (corp. goons) censoring sites that may or may not have sexual material on them, and making money from this se
<LI>I THINK IS IS GREAT, STIMULATING FOR CONSENTING ADULTS TO USE THE MATERIAL AS RELATIONSHIP ENHANCING DEVICE.
<LI>I think it gives people a place to express themselves openly.  You can't get pregnant or an STD from the computer.
<LI>I need .
<LI>As a member of the minority on the Internet (women) I am not surprised that pornographic material is available.  I do not know if it is rampant however, as I have not found any such sites on my travels.
<LI>sex is great provided it압 done with care and the "right" person (definition압 up to yourself). The Internet is a new medium, and therefore people like to expreiment out there (check the first movies: it was baout the same there) Love!
<LI>it could have more sex acts
<LI>Internet do not replace a woman for me.
<LI>net is good sex is good its fuckin great dont change a thing 
<LI>One area that I feel very strongly about, is that government should not get involved in our personal lives and that any form of government regulation is censorship - plain and simple.
<LI>different
<LI>It's Great fun 
<LI>I don't
<LI>I think sex is great...and on the internet it should be unrestricted (except for pedophilia or "kiddie porn") unless it leads to obsessions that induce deception on the part of one of the partners in a committed relationship thereby creating strain between the partners; this can and does lead to the alienation of the nonobsessed partner (most often the female) from the partner who is obsessed.  This alienation then, can and does, at times, become an "excuse" for an escalation of the obsession into be
avior destructive to the relationship.  
<LI>We need to end censorship!! Let us have what we want to see.
<LI>I see the potential for sex offender's and other pervert being able to have access to the young undeveloped mind of a child, however, like television parents should closely monitor what information our children have access to.  As a parent I accept that resonsibility, but I acknowledge the fact that as my children get older they will become more clever and somehow find a way to get into this type of information.  Remember hiding the "Play Boy" magazines from your parents...especially your mother.
<LI>IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR AND IT CAUSES NO PROBLEMS
<LI>I think nobody should be able to regulate the PUBLIC'S WANTS, If you dont like it, dont look at it. I dont know why people who dont like it look for it. They just want something to complain about I guess.
<LI>Unfortunately you can't moderate it without getting into censorship and you don't really want government getting involved in it.  I wish people would spend their time and effort elsewhere.  Sex should be sacred and traditional...as God intended it to be.
<LI>I don't think there is anything wrong with it. I am glad I have get to choose wether or not I want to look at it. 
<LI>Sex is a part of life - live with it!
<LI>haven't used it much but i'm interested
<LI>it's overrated 
<LI>Should be easy to access
<LI>I love it. If you dont want to see it dont look.
<LI>If there is much sex on the Internet, I have not yet found it.
<LI>the internet is about as erotic as calculus
<LI>It's a good source of info and entertainment but like everything man will fuck it up
<LI>more needed
<LI>It's very good!
<LI>well, there is sex in real-life (thats the reaseon why we are here and sex is one of the most important things in human life) if people want to talk about it, or enjoy pictures or whatsoever , i don`t care, cause i don`t do it in reallife, but if government thinks, that they have to control something which has nothing to do with thei contry, this makes me angry
<LI>It's fun,I think it's one of the popular thing on the net
<LI>I love it! It's my only chance to see naked men without the possibility of getting arrested or a disease.
<LI>its great
<LI>Feds should mandate ratings codes so parental-control browsers can block out porn.
<LI>Overdone.
<LI>to mutch commercial sites, to little public sites
<LI>it's everybodys right to talk/ get information about sex
<LI>Fucking Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Great!
<LI>I don't care
<LI>Great!
<LI>There seems to be mostly material directed towards men. what about having more material for women het and get?
<LI>Regulation is for the parents
<LI>Its there, I wish it wasn't because it is a temptaion for me!
<LI>I THINK IT'S A WOUNDERFULL SERVICE
<LI>Sex is very easy to find on the inernet and it is very arousing at times.  Sometimes i wish there wasn't people around so I could have more fun with it than I do now.
<LI>I think that its a good and fun expression for something that should be concidered a natural thing
<LI>I don't like computer sex much... I keep falling off the screen.
<LI>i have no problem with it. children should not have access but that is the parents responsibility.
<LI>great
<LI>It allows me to find out what different women do while masturbating
<LI>good open forum (as it should be); controls are lacking
<LI>I BELIEVE SEX WILL ALWAYS DOMINATE LIVES AT CERTAIN STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT.  I ALSO BELIEVE AN OPEN HONEST SEXUAL EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN IS ESSENTIAL.  IF PARENTS OR LEGAL GUARDIANS ALLOW CHILDREN ACCESS TO THE INTERNET THEY MUST BE FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR I
<LI>It helped me with a paper I was doing for class.
<LI>There are not enough pictures of naked men!!!!!
<LI>Good for mature questions, block children with software that parents can setup.
<LI>Sex is hapenning all over the World, Not against it but not adultry and the Internet is a great medium of information.
<LI>it good
<LI>I have no real problems with it. It will always be on the Net, and unless you go looking for it you will have no problems.
<LI>it`s really good i loooooove it
<LI>I think that sex should be in the net on an even greater level
<LI>Good i liked it wery much
<LI>I love what I've found but would desire to have more conversation on the subject without being charged.
<LI>Love it! Just don't like those commercial teasers.
<LI>That its a pretty good thing!!
<LI>I would like to know where I can experience more free stuff
<LI>a new world of exploration
<LI>GOOD
<LI>I think that the amount of sexual material on the Internet is very cool!
<LI>Sex on the Internet should not be censord and should be open for your viewing pleasure.
<LI>Great idea
<LI>I find it interesting and amusing.
<LI>i dont know,yet
<LI>Better than Televsion
<LI>I wish that I had more access to sexual material online.
<LI>it has taught me as lot
<LI>it's not very sexy, and what are you doing with responses?
<LI>I enjoy being able to discuss& view man's most pleasurable pastime
<LI>I've always been a porno guy.  So I'm for a little sex on the net.
<LI>It allows people to engage in behavior that they wouldn't normally engage in in public...as far as strangers are concerned.  It is better than having sex and exposing yourself to STDs.
<LI>I think it's okay.  Maybe there should be more.
<LI>i am only on line two weeks so i do not know yet!sorry.
<LI>I like it.  It is anomynous, you can explore different areas
<LI>very good
<LI>interesting way to learn about the world and the people in it
<LI>need more open free sights
<LI>Anybody need sex!
<LI>I enjoy finding stimulating material on the net, but it concerns me that the same information is avalible to my under aged child when he uses the net.
<LI>its okay...no value but okay
<LI>i think sex is just great especially when you have acess to information that helps better educate you.
<LI>I think that the Sex and the internet is great.
<LI>over rated
<LI>I don't want to see sex vanish from the Internet, I would very much like to see sites rated so that schools could block R & X sites if they so desired!
<LI>I don't know!
<LI>Not enough of it - Need more pantyhose.
<LI>I think isp's and parents/legal guardians are responsible for who sees what.  I also know that if you don't want to see it you don't have to
<LI>Fun. Tiny % of info has to do w/porn.Politicians well known for kneejerk overeaction to stuff they don't understand or fear
<LI>Bad idea
<LI>i am looking foward to it
<LI>Don't censor, let parents do their job.
<LI>stimulating and allows as a vent for sexual frustration
<LI>I love it and thats all I look for on the Internet.  Otherwise I find the Internet to be boring.  All I look for is anything dealing with sex and sex chatlines.
<LI>Sex should be a private act between one man and one woman who are married. Anthing else, inclduing homosexuality is perversion and an abomimation in the eyes of God!
<LI>In this day of AIDS;  safesex is Cybersex.
<LI>It's COOL!!!!
<LI>Great toy at lunch!
<LI>I think that it may be helpful for some people.  I am a singel male that is not in a relationship an hasn't been for quite some time.  It sometimes help me enjoy someof those things without haveing to go out into public to do so.
<LI>That's it?  I was expecting more detailed questions.  Note:  for gay men, questions like "when did you lose your virginity?" can be ambiguous.  Don't you want more details?
<LI>it's healthy!  Parents should monitor their own children instead of asking the government to do it for them.  We all lose that way.
<LI>Communication is communication. Censorship is censorship.  Never should the two meet!
<LI>I think you can find what you look for.  I don't see pornography or sex forced on those who don't seek it.  I feel strongly that censorship by any group is WRONG!.  I think it is the responsibility of parents to monitor what material children see.

<LI>it's very good choice
<LI>sex is great with a bisexual person enjoy threesomes
<LI>Free sex!
<LI>real porn is hard to get into on net
<LI>God punishes perverts
<LI>it shows how far society has really fallen
<LI>Good start, long way to go.. in both directions!
<LI>Interesting, but not very exciting
<LI>i Belive that any adult should be able to acess anything they want.
<LI>i think there is and should be a place for art forms.
<LI>haven't tried it too often
<LI>interesting
<LI>don't know how to find any of the good stuff...help!
<LI>I love it...
<LI>I think sex on the net is cool!  
<LI>The net is like a giant newsstand or library.If you see something you aren't looking for you pass by.or if you are looking for something you will find it.
<LI>I  find  it  an  easier  and  more  efficient  way  to  look  at  things  that  intrest  me  then  an  adult  bookstore.Also  i  hope  i  can  meet  people  throuh  placing  personal  ads  on  the  net.
<LI>it kicks ass
<LI>If you don't like it, DON'T LOOK AT IT!!!  'Nuff said.
<LI>I Have no opinion!!!
<LI>I wish it was a little easier to find hot chat, something I'd like to try
<LI>it fun and dose not cost anything for me
<LI>It serves the same purpose as pornagraphy on tv and phone
<LI>It is sometimes difficult to find sex on the internet-photos etc.
<LI>I love it and I think there should be more. (especially more graffic)
<LI>Too little!!!
<LI>I think that there should be only parental regulation of sex on the internt. All adults should have access to whatever imfomation that they desire.
<LI>I love sex on the internet.  While I'm at work and need to relax, it is very easy to distract myself for a few moments with help of the internet.
<LI>I like the freedom of choice and I like the idea of it being here when I want to veiw it..
<LI>I don't think it mhurts, as long as it's not taken too far, interupts with your life, or is hurtful, or if it gets into the wrong hands! It is supposed to be fun after all.
<LI>OK
<LI>It압 a part of the life today
<LI>people should take into considderation what they do
<LI>I like it. It seems harmless to me.
<LI>Sex is good. To suppress it in any form is perversion.
<LI>I love it..it is a place to act out my fantasies and explore new options that I might be afraid to do in person.
<LI>On the net or on the street, it's going to get found.
<LI>i think its great
<LI>great
<LI>I love sex, the internet is much bigger than sex though don't you think?
<LI>excellent resource area for individual quirks
<LI>I want more
<LI>Its Hear for the Folks that wnat it But for kids Well We had better keep them off untill they are 18.
<LI>It's a load of hogwash.  Who even cares if an 8 year old "bumps into" a picture of a naked woman?  It won't scar him for life.  As someone with virtually no interest in any sexual "perversions", I find this all a ridiculous attempt of the religious right 
<LI>Itz Co0l.. huhuh
<LI>Sex is a part of every aspect of life, the internet is just one aspect of many lives and of course sex is included.
<LI>I like it.  I wish it were available when I was 18 years old.
<LI>no coment
<LI>hmmmmm.!
<LI>I think it's no different from sex in magazine stores, video stores and television.  I also think that parents need to take more responsibility for the actions of their children as far as sex on the net.
<LI>It's mainly for men and their juvenile fantasies
<LI>i think it is like everything else, it is a  service that has a veery large market.
<LI>I think sex on the net is overrated and has been blown out of proportion by the media and the religious right
<LI>I think It is great if you find the right stuff
<LI>Its a good place to be honest about it
<LI>I think sex should be more available to net users.   to tell you the truth I've been net surfing for nearly a year before I found any sexuallly oriented topics
<LI>if people dont want to look at sex they should not look at sex!!!
<LI>For an adult, it's entertainment in private. BUT the Internet cannot monitor the perverts that will obsess all day and then go out and molest/rape. It's dangerous, and promotes moral decline by it's accessability.
<LI>It's overated and much easier to just get a video or mag.
<LI>Sex has been around since the first cell on Earth figured out how to multiply. Every Priest is the result of passionate sex between his parents (fortunately for him!). Every person who has ever lived has experienced sex 100's or 1000's of times.  We all do it and all love doing it. I'm tired of this nonesense that dates back to the Church's desire to dominate morality for their own enrichment. Sexuality is our most intimate and wonderful traits as human beings. Our problem is not our sexuality, our soc
etal problem is the failed attempts to regulate something that has always defied regulation. It should always be up to parents to teach their children about morality, sex, sexuality, love, idendity and self. Leave the Internet alone, it's a marvelous tool that must not be hampered.   
<LI>it's awesome!
<LI>Adults should be able to access whatever they choose especially if they are paying for the service.  Parents have the responsibility of monitoring their children's activities on the net just as they do in everything else.  It is a parent's responsibility to take the time to monitor and discipline their children, not the government or a censoring body.
<LI>more sites w/ porno material should be founded w/ free access (w/ password access only)
<LI>i believe that sexual communication whether in written or graphic pictorial display is a more positive thing than negative.  I do feel however that the access that children have now is too readily available-not enough restrictions.
<LI>I think it is perfectly alright because you can get it on T.V. you can get it in print so what is the difference if it is on the net.
<LI>what a turn-on!
<LI>there is lots of pictures it is kind of like a magazine
<LI>I have found that there are quite a few sites that discuss sexuality, but then require payment and proof of age before access to any pornographic material is allowed.  I understand the need to screen out minors and limit access, but am not happy about the "pay for play" attitude.
<LI>I have no problem with it
<LI>I enjoy it every now and then,  yet I do not think children should be allowed access.  Parent/guardian regulation should interceed,  and would be made aware of such content of a site by establishing a rating system not unlike the one used for today's music.
<LI>I think it is cool
<LI>I wish I could find Hard Core Pornography that did not cost me any money.  I can't find any anywhere.
<LI>It's damn satisfying!!!!!
<LI>Y knot!
<LI>Mooore!
<LI>Too less girls
<LI>OK!
<LI>Without this ready outlet, I think I'd be a much more tense person than I am.
<LI>I think sex on the net is very good for those that are:1-Very curious. or2-Have no other outlet.
<LI>I think it's great!
<LI>Fun to see your fantasies in print...totally harmless when used properly.  Can be abused but if users are careful about the information they submit there is no problem
<LI>If people don't like having sex on the Internet then they should not go looking for it!
<LI>Sex Should be a gift inside of marriage!
<LI>I really enjoy it.  
<LI>I like it! More, More, More
<LI>I think sex is a normal, healthy and it's great that we can access it on the internet
<LI>It sucks and has hurt me!!with the lord!!!
<LI>I think that it is a great outlet and that it has helped with my personal sex life and made me open to other options.
<LI>its fun
<LI>I had sex first with when I was 7 with my brother. I masturbate thrice a day. Fucking is fun, especially with boys 11 years or so.
<LI>I Think It's Great!
<LI>I THINK THAT HONEST COMMUNICATION ABOUT SEX HAS TAKEN A TURN FOR THE BETTER.
<LI>IT IS FINE, IF PEOPLE WANT TO SEE IT THEY WILL ACCES IT AND IF THEY DONT THEY  WONT.
<LI>Not enough!!!!
<LI>I think it is our right to view, exchange, and download explicit material among adults as long as it doesn't violate any federal or state laws.  I think we as adults should have the option of choice whether we agree or not to its contents.  Limit government interference.  Come on, enough is enough!
<LI>sexual content is on the internet but it is also in other aspects of everyones lives. if you can't get it there they will get it somewhere else. just regulate it.
<LI>It's simply a reflection of what we are.
<LI>Cybersex ain't sex!!!
<LI>I love sex and the internet.  Many sites are dissapointing or want money for real access.  Too many boring graphics cost me and ny modem money.
<LI>I have not realley seen any that was in bad taste.
<LI>It should be there for those that want it. Let parents be responsable for what their children see.
<LI>I think that sex on the internet is no different than sex magazines in gas stations and bookstores.  It's just as accessible and promonent in movies, on cable, and even public prime time.  Why should the net be any different???
<LI>Good source for those not able to explore elsewhere
<LI>Why not? we need to get over our Puritanical heritage in this country
<LI>I have not had too much experience with it on the net, but like anything else in this world, if you want to find it you will.  You really can't keep secrets, especially from the curious minded.
<LI>it's great ,but hard to get real stuff for free
<LI>Great outlet for anything people are into. If you don't want to see it, don't look for it
<LI>love it
<LI>I think it is fine Parents should block sex at home on Pc
<LI>People should lighten up.  Parents should be responsible
<LI>It's overrated

<LI>parents should either install one of the many programs to sensor out the material or keep their kids off the net!!
<LI>DEVELOP VOLUNTARY LOCKOUT SOFTWARE AS IN CABLE TV
<LI>Only child pornography should be censored
<LI>the groups should stop telling others how to live their lives!
<LI>LET WHOEVER WANTS TO "HAVE SEX" ON THE NET BE PERMITTED TO DO SO
<LI>Make parents resposible for their children, not the goverment.  You can not legislate morality.
<LI>complety open
<LI>open but to the selected few of age and by proof
<LI>let stay open but its 99% crap anyway
<LI>parental involvment/supervision/software
<LI>ISSUE NET AGE ID CARDS
<LI>It is up to parents to determine what their children do on the net.
<LI>The net should be completely open with optional censorship by those who do not want their children to see it.  Also schools.
<LI>parents take responsibility and monitor thier kid
<LI>do nothing but have everything free
<LI>Crypto Controlled Access for Adults to Adult matter.
<LI>Parental supervision software, plus existing laws on the making of pornography. The net cannot be realistically controlled without the loss of freedom of speech on other matters.
<LI>Should be parents job-lock outs are a out there
<LI>get rid of those groups, bosnia needs troops
<LI>I love it
<LI>make screening software more accessible
<LI>Each person to decide their own involvement.
<LI>Fuck that
<LI>parentally controlled restricted access for children
<LI>No government should try to regulate morality
<LI>give away free copies of personal cernsoring software
<LI>if you dont like it then FUCK OFF!!!!! AND DONT SPOIL IT FOR OTHERS!!!!!!
<LI>passwords preventing certain searches ie "sex"
<LI>be self regulating
<LI>Let the perants handel thier kids and leave everyone eles alone. If a perant doesn't want thier kids seeing sexual content on the internet then don't have it in your house or keep the computer locked up and only let your kids use it when supervised. But leave the rest of us alone and let us make choices for ourselves!
<LI>there has to be some limits
<LI>Don't do anything
<LI>The net should be completely open for all, because that is our chance to comunicate in future. we have to come togehther without any damned force from governments 4 example the americans (remember what they`ve done in the past because of their belief to better the world-let them educate their own people first) the Net will starve without communication around the world : NO CENSORSHIP ANYWHERE (by the way: who gives them the right to enforce morality standards? Bullshit! let their be life in net!!!
<LI>Browsers should have a software equivalent of the parental-control V-chip.
<LI>find a way to control accesibility of age groups
<LI>Warning page prior to exposure.
<LI>Remove violent, degrading porn
<LI>Keep Children off, or empower the parents
<LI>Social customs evolving on the Net provide the same sort of self-regulation found in society as a whole.
<LI>Any rating suystem should be in the form of a warning, not censoring.
<LI>people should be able to censor the internet at home.
<LI>completely open net; restrictions at user front-end
<LI>SUBSCRIBER PASSWORDS
<LI>Enhanced software to block sex if requested.
<LI>Let it be at the descretion of users anything outragous should be voted on.  Somewhat of a self-governing subsociety.
<LI>completely open only if requested and with proof of age.
<LI>use passwords
<LI>Shut down the winer's
<LI>promote child-proof software/shareware products
<LI>netnanny,other screening programs,mandatory code inclusion
<LI>Some type of system that can "lock out" undesirable material would be of great benefit.  I think this would solve the censorship issue.
<LI>Some type of system that can "lock out" undesirable material would be of great benefit.  I think this would solve the censorship issue.
<LI>self censorship
<LI>If you dont like it turn it off and watch your kids
<LI>FUck 'em and suck 'em
<LI>let people do what they feel
<LI>Some screen should be developed for parents
<LI>A democratic body to rate sites, not linked to any government or state but independently elected on the net
<LI>lets Take care of it at Home 
<LI>let commercial programs censor if you buy them
<LI>don't like , don't look !
<LI>If they don't like it, they shouldn't be looking.
<LI>something else, but don't know what
<LI>1st amendment - nuff said
<LI>just do what you want when you are ready
<LI>Rate the areas, and provide parental control features
<LI>Ban child pornographers and cut their nuts off.
<LI>sites only to be accessed via e-mail address & special password
<LI>somehow limit the availability that children i.e. under-18 persons have.
<LI>allow individual servers to monitor
<LI>If you not like it, shut it off
<LI>The worst thing about censorship is     .
<LI>Encourage Parental monitoring
<LI>Child Porn is BAD The rest is fine

<H2><CENTER><I>What do YOU think about Sex & the Internet?</I></CENTER></H2>
<H5>
<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_MYSEX -->
<LI>All the sexual topics do not interest me, therefore I indulge only the areas that do.
<LI>if one is of age they should be able to see what they want
<LI>we need more free site of sex
<LI>What adults do with this is their own business, but there is way too much sexually related material in my own opinion
<LI>very good
<LI>IT'S FUNNY, BUT IT IS TOO EASY TO ACCESS.  BY NO MEANS AM I FOR CENSORSHIP.
<LI>I think that it sucks kinda because it has made me horny and I don't think that it right  I wanted to save myself until I got marriied now I am not sure if I will...
<LI>I personally don't care about the sleaze, if someone wants it they can find it here or anywhere else. Those who have no idea give the impression that the net is one big orgy... puhleeze! Now, open access to quality information is a need that should be accessible. Censorship=ignorance!
<LI>Its great
<LI>Glad that you are collecting this anonymous data.  Now I want to see your survey CGI script so I can copy it for my own projects.
<LI>I don't mind. Sometimes it makes the internet kinda fun! 
<LI>i dont now were those sights are
<LI>Sex should be open and freely discussed and viewed.  Children should learn about sex through the internet.
<LI>Sex stuff is quite easy to access, all one has to do is perfrom a "search" on it and there it is!!
<LI>free things arent free, fufilling fantisies difficult
<LI>certain factions mostly religous, try to impose their values on everyone.  Parentnts use the 'Net to baby sit their kids and blame everyone else for the sites the kids enter.  Society in general has to realize that this information is available anyhow and the net is a tool to explore our sexuality without embaresment.
<LI>I find that I use the Internet to look for sex a lot
<LI>It adds a level of appeal to it.
<LI>I think the internet is a wonderful place to give out sexual education to people who may be otherwise too embarassesd to ask elsewhere.  As far as the "pornography" part.  I, and many other people don't find the human body, or things done with it, offensi
<LI>I think that with alot of the sites actually costing money that it makes it hard to get good pornography off the net.
<LI>freedom of speech
<LI>Just keep the government out of it.
<LI>The society is mixed up about sexuality.  The net is an expression of that confusion.  Each person is special and sugnificant and therefore should be treated with respect.  that respect sould include sexuality.....
<LI>IT'S FUN. I HAVE A GOOD TIME JUST CHECKING OUT THE LINKS PAGES JUST TO SEE WHAT I CAN FIND.
<LI>i don't have an answer for this question
<LI>Parents should control the content of any thing their children see, watch and hear. If left up to the government out kids would be worst off, look at what the politicians have done to socialize us now.
<LI>i'de like to learn more about the opportunities
<LI>Sex on the internet is great!  It's healthy and gets your mind and imagination working.  And it's safe!
<LI>It's safer then having sex in the real world. No worry of comminisable diseases.
<LI>I think that the xtian assholes need to mind there own fake lives if you don't like it don't do it ! Hipocrats
<LI>I feel it's a safe outlet for sexual fantasies
<LI>I think it's great !
<LI>They need more fetish archives.
<LI>i don't think anything. It was just something I did to kill time.
<LI>sex should be available for those who want it. Therefor it is a parents responsibility to moniter their children on the internet. 
<LI>I met my fiance on irc. We are in a long distance relationship and being on-line has helped our relationship grow. It is much easier to talk about things (especially intimate/personal things) on-line than face-to-face. 
<LI>I think the first amendment should be upheld in that sexual content should be allowed on the internet. Unfortunataly, since many parents are clueless to their childrens actions, the government does need to somewhat regulate material on the internet.
<LI>Open sex on the internet is great!
<LI>I really think that it is the responsibility of parents - it really is no different than pornograghic magazines...kids will look at it no matter what you do.  It is up to their parents to try an restrict it, however.
<LI>The survey asks good questions and accepts that gays may well be answering as well, let down however by the line of scantily clad women at the bottom of the survey; not to my taste!! 
<LI>I wish it was easier to get free sexual content on the Internet including free sexual samples and other sexually explicit materials.
<LI>I think that sex is wonderful and it was made for mankind.  The internet is a way for people who are not open to sex to learn or get a thrill out of sex.
<LI>Sex on the internet is no worse than Penthouse or Playboy ... it should be used responsibly 
<LI>It is good, but I would like to see more articles about anal sex amongst heterosexual african americans.
<LI>More sex on the interenet less violence on tv and movies I'll go for that tradeoff
<LI>Too few girls around and too many guys pretending to be girls.
<LI>Wish there were more free pictures of GREAT looking women!
<LI>At this point and time I do not have a lot of experience on the net. However I was able to secure some valuable info on a lifestyle I'm interested in pursuing.
<LI>its a great way to get answers to things you were afraid to even mention to your best friend
<LI>I am in favor of more open forums on sexual behavioral and educational material for teenagers.  Information could help teenagers make more intelligent decisions.
<LI>good
<LI>Sex is good, sex is great, let us ALL participate.
<LI>The Internet is a reflection of humanity.  What happens here happens in society.  If we censor it, we are just an ostrich hinding our head in the sand.  
<LI>Sex exists everywhere.  The internet is just another outlet.
<LI>good
<LI>Love sex, and like to see mild sexual content. Educational content OK for kids
<LI>I have found that the vast range of sexual content on the Internet has helped me discover what I am really "in" to, rather than uninformed fantasy.  I no longer hanker after things that I probably wouldn't have enjoyed anyway. Information is a great thing.
<LI>I'd like to see educational information, quizzes, surveys and personal issues rather than the pornography.  BUT...I also believe "to each his own" AND I believe porn should be regulated by offering a service to parents to exclude such access to children.  And ABSOLUTELY NO PERVERSION such as Child porn or animal sex, etc.  Only regulated porn like Playboy and more REALLY INTERESTING sites that would attract some honest places to find out if you're "normal", what an orgasm really is, how many times a we
k is "normal".  You get the picture.  More fun, less pictures.
<LI>Saved my sanity ;-)
<LI>The internet allows the freedom for adults to learn about sexuality in their own privacy.
<LI>Relatively harmless; The really nasty stuff costs money, so most people won't bother
<LI>Although I like it a lot, but I'm must confess that I look for pornography when I look for gay "issues".
<LI>The Internet is a very open and free medium (which is a good thing) so there is bound to be a lot of sexual material on it. It would be impossible to censor the Internet so it should be up to childrens' parents to guard them from things they shouldn't see.
<LI>the people should be responsible for regulating themselves.
<LI>I have always been a fan of sex.  And I think that showing sexual stuff on the net is ok.
<LI>Well, as I said above, I feel that the parents should be responsible for their own children and that there are too many people wanting it done for them
<LI>As I said in No.13 better to have this outlet for your sexual desires than enflict them on other people (willing or not so willing
<LI>Children should be monitored by the parents when accessing the Net
<LI>i LOVE sex on the net.
<LI>no comment
<LI>There are already laws on the books protecting children. Minors can't smoke, drink, stay out all night, or view naked ladies on the NET. If the parents can't stop little Johnnie from doing these things ....why do I have to suffer?? (censorship)
<LI>People are becoming more and more afraid of the sexual content of the Internet, or the Internet in general.  The media continues to put a bad stereotype upon  users of the Internet and the Internet as a whole.  Until we as a society better understand the Internet, and understand that we have a responsibility to ourselves and our children, then this stereotype will continue to plague the Internet.
<LI>I think it's good that there is sex on the Net, most people want to sex and why shouldn't it be on the Net? Of course people who doesn't want to see it shouldn't be forced to anything!
<LI>It really opens a lot of eyes in that people feel there are others with the same thoughts, thus they are not at all alone in this world with these "bad" thoughts.
<LI>It is very rare to see pornographic images or material on the net unless you make the choice to open such a site. If you stumble across some by accident it is usually rather obvious and the back key can take you away before you get offended. But really I think it is childish to get offended and indicates that the person has no emotional control. If some are worried about children deliberately sccessing such sites they will find plenty of censoring software in computer shops. But maybe you just got a ho
ny kid if you find they are accessing porn sites often. So what..long as you talk to them about it and express your own views.
<LI>I think there is not enough sex for Straight women on the net. There is tons of stuff for men and gays...
<LI>I believe in the right of adults to access and view any material without government intervention.
<LI>rate sites, provide browsers and blocking, parents are responsible for kids.
<LI>I have no problem with sex on the internet, as long as all are consenting adults!
<LI>There should be no regulation other than parent/guardians for moral standards.  Think about it regulated freedom...it's an oxymoron..freedom can't be regulated.  I do however support a ratings system to guide the guardians and unsuspecting individuals of the content of a site before entering.
<LI>Parents should not allow children to wander alone on the Internet.
<LI>Too public
<LI>Adults should be able to decide for themselves.
<LI>The whole pornography/cybersmut hysteria is a result of Christoon Coalition election politics.
<LI>                                                                
<LI>It is safe sex!
<LI>As long as it doesn't hurt anyone...Go for it!!!
<LI>You need to be your own person and do what you think is right.  
<LI>Properly used it can be very liberating, and open up a closed mind.
<LI>Very exciting.  Very safe, if its kept on the cyber realm.  Can greatly improve the relationship between two people if properly approached
<LI>I thank the so called "GOOD Sites" charge to much money.
<LI>It has been wonderful for me.
<LI>no regulation, free speech!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Give us freedom!  Life is short - we should have fun in the Internet!  So what if some people love those steaming pictures!  If they don't get it online, they get it somewhere else! 
<LI>The internet is a sexually liberating force in a very puritanical age.
<LI>I think that all sexual preferences should be allowed on the net.  There should be not banning at all for some material.
<LI>Hello, we live in the U S A! remember that freedom of speech thing. We should leave sex on the net alone.
<LI>open minded people should have acess without government interfernce or censorship
<LI>It's a shame when people in the media harp on about it and try to use it as an excuse to shut down or censor the net, the positive aspects of the net far outway the couple of idiots caught for downloading child porn.
<LI>my hardrive is starting to look like a cunt
<LI>Enjoy a good discussion
<LI>Too difficult to find. Need better instructions on how to get there. Also, an index providing chat rooms, exchange of phornography, explicit sex stories, etc.
<LI>It is very interesting to see how people interact on the Net.
<LI>One is a computer the other is emotion, the don't mixed.
<LI>I enjoy having it available, but I think solutions should be found to sensor material from children, without making it unavailable to adults.
<LI>no view yet, new user
<LI>Ithink people should mind their own business. It's up to the individual, and if people worry about their kids, then they should regulate THEM more not the Internet
<LI>I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH IT. I BELIVE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN ACTIONS NOT ANYONE ELSE
<LI>a must
<LI>i like it fuckers!
<LI>I would not be in favour of having an official governing body telling me what I can and cannot watch. As time goes on, the sexual slant of the net should decrease (percentage wise anyway) in the same way that photography itself evolved in content. Parents of any minors who happen across "unpleasant" should discuss the issues raised in an adult manner without trying to censor everything for their "benefit". 
<LI>It's an excellent form of safe sex. 
<LI>I'm so horny now!!!!
<LI>over rated, People who are looking for it will find it... People who are just curious will find it...  Government should not regulate the internet becouse it is a society of pure democracy; the people decide what is appropriate and what isn't.  For example:  junk e-mail is not wanted, and people (hackers mostly) try there best to stop it... often it doesn't last long...
<LI>WHO IS ASKING THESE QUESTIONS? WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE MAD ANIMAL LOVE TO ME .  I AM SO ALONE.
<LI>it's pretty great, cuz u can know a bit more about it...i mean sex
<LI>It will never replace actual sex.
<LI>Stop it !
<LI>The Internet can be an educational resource which has great use in  teaching people about things such as safe sexual  practices,prevention of STDs,and serving as a  device for those who are not sexually active to satisfy some of their needs in this area.
<LI>It fills the needs of individuals to geeky to feel comfortable elsewhere.
<LI>i don't know. it doesn't bother me, but i don'r look for it every time i am on here.
<LI>Good form of entertainment and should be accessible to those that want it.
<LI>A good way to meet people with the same interests as yourself
<LI>They should have more things such as this to find out people think about sex and the net.
<LI>I think there are many more important subjects for a half way intelligent person to concern himself or herself with. Hell, if you have a child using the "net" for purposes that you don't like, just stop paying the ISP's bill.
<LI>its pretty cool
<LI>A LOT OF VERIETY
<LI>Real Sex is a lot better....yeah
<LI>I use the net both for a safe, unadulturous way to fulfill some desires.  No one is hurt with interactive sex.
<LI>The internet decency act is just another way in which the US government is trying to tell the whole world what to do.
<LI>I love it baby, all the way, can't get enough, it's what I live for, yum yum give me some, long live porno
<LI>It only really becomes a problem when children (or those who think like children) surf without supervision.
<LI>I need it in internetand & in my life/Thanxs
<LI>It's great!  I want more!
<LI>sex rules !!! all kinds of sex is great if you take the proper precautions. I think the internet is a very powerfull weapon for sexual education
<LI>Not  a problem to those of us who enjoy it.
<LI>I would rather look at a video
<LI>why not?  americans have few privleges and less freedom.  what happened to freedom of speech and the persuit of happiness.
<LI>Sex is sacred and should be dealt with as such on the internet and elswhere!
<LI>I must say the pediofiles concern me-that's all though. Turn the channel if ya don't like it!
<LI>It's great!!!
<LI>I think the site that do offer pictures, products, etc. Do a good job of posting warnings before entering their pages. Also most pages that have sexual material have to either be accessed by a password or paid for with a credit card.
<LI>wish i could find out how to get to the pages of sexual content
<LI>Is it real?
<LI>Sex on the net is as varied as who puts the sex on the net.  I always prefer finding a small, personal erotic site with mild porn than a commercial hardcore site.
<LI>forget the site charges.  i would spend alot of time looking for the free stuff before paying.  the age verifaction services are alright i guess but still a pain.
<LI>I love it. Hiding it from public's eyes is only counter-effective. The more laws will be broken and more preversities posted. Let the people choose what they want see, not some old politicians. Freedom is the key. Thanks and good luck!
<LI>Real people and genuine experiences are far more interesting.
<LI>it's very good
<LI>has been rewarding, educational, sometimes moving, always facinating,,,,,actually a learning and growing experience rather than  self indulgent
<LI>GIVE ME MORE GIVE ME MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Keep it coming. (So to speak)
<LI>if that's what people are into...it's their choice
<LI>it sucks
<LI>no matter what you click, you're still ultimately masturbating
<LI>looking at pictures is  okay,but beyond that wrong
<LI>PLEASE SOMEONE SUCK ME!!!
<LI>Nice to see
<LI>Sex is the esscense of humanity, it is not dirty nor should it be hidden, used properly it is the stuff that wonderful memories are made of and does not have to be contaminated by feeling of guilt and remorse whether or not it is with one partner or many. It is as individual as fingerprints.
<LI>i enjoy it along with my husband
<LI>people shouldn't decide for others if it's not harmful to someone
<LI>its alright if you are looking 4 some, but it is 2 highly publicesed.
<LI>I love it!
<LI>some stuff are quite good, but unfortunatly there is also a lot of rubbish
<LI>It's a bit of a laugh, occasionally enlightening!
<LI>?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
<LI>I enjoy it. It's reawakened my imagination and that's good.
<LI>It's basically disgusting!  Surely, these people have something better to do!
<LI>its hard to find unless you pay
<LI>I think it's a big money making deal. Nothings for free.
<LI>sex on the net is not as bad as every one says
<LI>Personally, I just can't get turned on by a computer monitor
<LI>It's almost every where you go.  I actually just bumped into this site.  I was not even looking for sex related things.  If you want to view sex stuff on your computer and that's how you get your kicks then more power to you.  I frankly find it distasteful, unless, I get arroused and my husband and I do something about it.
<LI>its good
<LI>The internet is a multi-national computer network of users, it should be treated as such.
<LI>it's an interesting way to learn what happens out in the world be it perverted or not.
<LI>They're nuts to think I'm gonna pay the fees 
<LI>It is good for some.
<LI>The First Amendment RULES!  Parents, not government, are responsible for their children.  Adults who do not wish to see sex on the internet do not have to look for it.
<LI>The Internet is a free expression of people around the world and that right should be cherished.
<LI>The Internet should be completly open. If we can't take the bad with the good and regulate, soon there will be no good either.
<LI>It's ok when you are curious
<LI>Morality is a personal thing.  Parents need to take responsibility for their children, instead of expecting government, media, etc. to govern what they are exposed to.  I think the Internet has opened a lot of people's minds, and for those with more obscure tastes, the Internet has probably helped them to feel they are not alone.  Sex is good; violence is what we should be concentrating on eliminating.
<LI>I love it , it beats Telephone sex.
<LI>I wish it were more pervasive, chats personals etc.
<LI>I think that it should be open for all adults to access , without government, state or local interference of any kind.
<LI>It`s cool
<LI>I've met so many great guys here!
<LI>It's totally overrated. Mostly girlie pics, which incidentally I find more offensive than pics of plain ole naked folks.
<LI>i get a better view of sex issues using the net, cost wise, it is cheap and the internet is private 
<LI>Sex on the Internet is great for those people able to handle it and bad for those who get lost in it.  Yet it is a persons responsibilty to police themselves.  If you don't like it or can't handle it.. stay out of it!!
<LI>i get a better view of sex issues using the net, cost wise, it is cheap and the internet is private 
<LI>Sex is a part of life.  If we truly believe in freedom of speech then let us pratice it.  Why should my entertainment be curtailled because some parents can not control their children.  It is the parent's responsibility to monitor their kid's activities.
<LI>I think the ultimate responsibility lies with the parents...censorship of the Net is a waste of time
<LI>I enjoy it very much, but it is too easy for children to access. The situation is improving though.
<LI>I believe that the Internet should be an open forum for communication, and that no form of censorship should be allowed-except by parents on their own children.
<LI>FIne with me!
<LI>Great.
<LI>Hell, I found this site easily enough....
<LI>Cool
<LI>freedom of speech should let everyone read or look at anything on the net
<LI>it's great
<LI>NO EXPERIENCES---YET
<LI>more very free horny pictures
<LI>you are new frontier
<LI>I love sex on the net and I do it as much as possible!!!
<LI>no coment
<LI>This is another area where the Republican Jesunatzi's are trying to control the USA.  They say they are trying to protect kids, however they are against any form of sexual expression on the NET ...serious or not.  There are a number of ways for parents to screen f or adult areas and porno areas are not freely open for kids to stumble on.  The problem is with those who get upset just knowing someone is having sex right now and probably enjoying more then thry are.
<LI>Great!!!I like to look at dirty pictures, but keep the children away
<LI>I have no real opinion. Sex is a much over rated thing. I don't see why people can't simply accept their animal natures and just on with it.
<LI>Whats wrong with it
<LI>Interesting to see/read about sexual practices I haven't/don't/wouldn't indulge in except in fantasy.
<LI>its fine by me as long as the person or persons involved are concenting 
<LI>Erotic stories are cool, but I don't care much for the gross pictures.
<LI>I believe that it is a good thing since it is a function of life.  Europeans have no problem displaying sex in any form.  Nudity on beaches is normal behavior in many countries. Sex on the internet can be a form of education and may eliminate the need for molestation and rape in society.
<LI>There is a great deal of perversion, but it can be easily avoided by those who do not wish to view it.
<LI>I think it's a great way for adults to express themselves like never before and to learn about issues they had previously been denied access to.  This "access" hasn't necessarily been denied by someone/something but by social standards that can make it very embarrasing for some to explore thier individual sense of sexuality FREELY.
<LI>I enjoy it.  It provides me with a safe and inexpensive sexual outlet.
<LI>Sex is a beautiful, natural act and if people choose to post it on the internet that should be okay. I've posted pictures of myself naked. People like to see pictures of my naked 12-year-old body. I get email all the time about it.
<LI>As far as censorship goes, I believe tht education is the only way to ensure that people who have sex, which they will do anyway, as soon as they are ready for it, do it safely. The net is a particularly helpful, supportive place for groups which suffer prejudice, such as non-heterosexuals, polyamorists and sadomasochists, and it promotes greater understanding and equality.
<LI>It isnt the goverments place to tell us what our kids do or see.
<LI>I like it
<LI>Harmless, this generations playboys, and they didnt hurt anyone did they?
<LI>It is very intriguing but not mesmerizing.  Sex on the net is like frosting on the cake...just a little bonus added to something already good!
<LI>There's too much controversy about it & any censorship of it is wrong.
<LI>it is great
<LI>I think it's great!  I found pictures that I can't find anywhere in the "real world".  I'm very happy with it, and I don't want it to be censored.
<LI>we don't have enough free sex sites on the Net, we should have access to more pictures and sex scenes. 
<LI>I THINK THE NET IS AN INFORMATION HIGHWAY NOT THAT SHOULD NOT BE BOUND BY GOVERNMENT.  PARENTS ETC SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CENSORING WHAT THEIR SHILD WATCHES.  
<LI>Why do so many people have a hang up about sex?  Let's all grow up and accept our bodies and sex.
<LI>Still exploring.  It's my first look.
<LI>I feel that sexual material on the net should be made more available and censorship needs to stop.
<LI>I'm 13, and have had cybersex 3 times. So what? What is wrong with someone like myself (under 18) exploring their own sexuality? No one has come up with a legitamite answer.
<LI>I have no problem with sex on the Internet.  The whole point is that you do not have to look at it if you don't want to.  Those in power seem to think that the general public are unable to think for themselves and therefore need to told what to and what not to do with their minds.  But I also believe that a child who is not emotionally ready to view any material regarding to sex, should be supervised by parent/guardian while on the Net (or a program, such as Nanny, be operational just in case).
<LI>I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
<LI>For myself & my family, it is not welcome...but everyone should be able to choose for themselves, not controlled by govt.
<LI>I like it alot, but needs more use of goats in leather
<LI>good thing
<LI>An easily found area of interest, like any other, that should be availabe to those that wish to participate without restriction (assumed of age or with parental guidance_
<LI>highly overstated
<LI>i belive in freedom
<LI>people use the internet to make loads of money selling pictures and other sex-related services
<LI>I think there is a lot of duplication and little originality but an accurate reflection of society in general.
<LI>it's about time that adults can access and view what they want in the privacy of their own home. It's illegal and obsurd for the government to in any way censor what we may see or speak abouton the net. 
<LI>SHOULD ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE NO CENSORSHIP
<LI>it's almost impossible to connect with kindred sexual spirits in the "normal" world,but careful searching through the net may allow fine tuning of who you relate with. i think it's an answer to a life-long desire and need for me.
<LI>I think that sex is as common and uncommon on the 'net as anywhere else. BTW: This survey *should* have prompted people to input their current age.
<LI>Sex is GREAT... However the consenting persons choose to partake... The net is great it allows choice... If you don't like or are offended by something choose not to get involved with it...!
<LI>It's great!!!!!!!
<LI>I'd like to know when i'm being charged for access if at all
<LI>It's getting harder to find good sites...all the sites I happen upon are filled with ugly women and I feel it's a waste of my time as of late.
<LI>We all are tryin to get some... kids too. Didn't you ever play house when you were a kid? I think sex on the net helps open up dialogue. Lord knows we need to be a little less stressed about sex.
<LI>The internet has given me great access to all kinds of stuff that makes me really horny.  I think it's great.
<LI>fine with me, better to learn about it over the computer than go out an experience it and get pregnant or diseased.
<LI>The Internet is a wonderful cyber tool, but sex is so much better in "real life."
<LI>Might encourage 'perversion' from person who doesn't have lot's of life experience (especialy sexual experience
<LI>great
<LI>I find that you can find others who share the same interest
<LI>I am for it 100%
<LI>It's what people want.  I don't see anything wrong with it if it is consented to.
<LI>All the furor over porn on the net is ridiculous - on a scale of one to ten in terms of how important an issue it is, I rate it sub-zero. Parents who don't want their kids accessing dirty stuff should take the responsibility themselves. I wish the politicians would let go of this non-issue and deal with some REAL problems.
<LI>Singapore has the internet servers regulating sites...it is harder and harder to reach even newsgroups discussing about the subject.....a crying pity
<LI>Leave it on the net!!!!!!!! It is a safe place for it,
<LI>See my response to 13.  The government should require the placement of codes on pages with pornagraphic material, and provide free software that will see the code and censor IF THE PERSON USING THE BROWSER So DESIRES.
<LI>I don't believe in infringement of any rights whatsoever. If we don't stand up to them (US Gov.) now, we won't have any rights later!
<LI>great
<LI>Great for adults
<LI>Of course, most sites are pay-only, but the under18 warnings don't work.
<LI>I'm sorry, this appears to be a very biased survey: there are little or no positive choices under #9; what about letting people know that what they feel is ok, that other people feel the same?  What about alt.sex.abuse.help?  This is far from impartial, and very dissappointing.
<LI>The only way you can get at it,
<LI>Internet help secure sex
<LI>I likeit, there is nothing wrong with it its is completly natural anyone who is ignorant enough to not see that it does no harm can kissmy ass
<LI>It is very disguisting and  I  think these people need REAL SEX!!
<LI>It's neato
<LI>the real sicko 's should have an area of their own. ther are some real sick puppies out there.
<LI>There is some sick shit (other than sexual) on the Internet
<LI>I think it is great
<LI>It's good for the society
<LI>I think it's an outlet for the frustrated people.  The government wouldn't have to worry about censorship, if parents would regulate what their children do with their computers.
<LI>Not much. I've tried to make swingin' contacts, but to no avail !
<LI>need more!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Personally, I think that it is pathetic.......To me, it's like phone sex.  I'm all for masturbation, but when you bring in a total stranger, there's something wrong.  I can handle the trading of pictures.....I do it just to see how many I can get, I think it's funny.
<LI>i am not too interested in downloading sexual pictures, though i have downloaded a few before. unfortunatley, theres trillions of sexual sites. id ont find it offensive, it just doesnt interest me much. as for children, i think cybersurf and other programs are probably benficial. i am only 24 and do not have any children. i think having net sex or masturbated to x/r rated sexual photos from the net isnt bad..its the safest form of sex around. it shouldnt be banned, it should just be regualted a little 
it better.
<LI>great and fun
<LI>I am interested in pictures only.  Regular pornographic pictures are easy to obtain but I have been unable so far to view pictures of 8 to 18 year old girls.  I would never think of molesting a child.  The effects are obviously so devastating that any such sexual activity should be punished severely.  Therefor I wopul be thankful for easier access to pictures (or drawings).  To be honest though, I am still a beginner as far as net use is concerned.  I have not yet figured out how to get access to the u
ergroups in Dyrc's lists.
<LI>It is very hard to find sites that have content for straight women. We have to go to gay men's sites to find pics of men.
<LI>There's a lot of it, but so what. Popularity, I think, is based on the interactivity of working with computers. A new medium will exploited in everyway...one of them sexually.
<LI>Great!
<LI>some times i think it is hard to get what i want on the enternet
<LI>It's great. You can find anything here, really easy
<LI>Just like life, it is there if you want it.  Parents should stop surrendering their responsibilities to the government, while they still can!
<LI>I think it is good for mature adults...
<LI>Interesting
<LI>I'm glad it's there... I'm too shy to purchase magazines in person so I'm glad I can have access to it on the internet and anonymously (sort of)
<LI>Allows viewing of sexual material in the privacy of your own home
<LI>I am kinda interested in inchanging fantasies with some women out there
<LI>sex is big at any media, the net is just an other media
<LI>Sex is a great gift and should be enjoyed freely, though not completely without supervision as there are sick individuals around. Internet is only one more channel to get and enjoy sex, if one wants to censor the net then magazines and private mail comes short after that.
<LI>COOL
<LI>Useful
<LI>It's a good thing
<LI>i don't konwn, i did not find anything
<LI>Its sick
<LI>It cah be a healthy outlet if kept in the proper perspective. Parents should make themselves more aware of what their children do on the net. Net screening software is available and should be used.
<LI>dying to find hotter and heavier and even wetter
<LI>i think it should all be for free, no registration crap
<LI>Thanks
<LI>Like everything...use in moderation.
<LI>I find that it makes me quite horny, and in return I go howm and have wonderful sex.  I've met some interesting people on the net I think it's a blast and I really enjoy it.  If people are against it they shouln't participate.  Sex is everywhere and it's 
<LI>KEPT OPEN AND MATURELY ITS FINE. SEX IS A FACT OF LIFE
<LI>Cyberporn is a form of free-speech. Let technology create its own device to protect children from it.  And leave the responsibility to parents!!!
<LI>WISH I COULD FIND IT
<LI>I love sex and am glad it is on the net.  I don't think any of it should be banned.
<LI>accessible, abundant, stimulating
<LI>I think its awesome, wish there was more hardcore pics!
<LI>I believe parents should strive to control what comes into their homes, regardless of whether it comes from the internet or it's hidden in their child's backpack.
<LI>I think it can get a little disgusting espiecally if your not on the net to talk dirty to anybody. If I was looking for a date, I wouldn't talk to a bunch of people who were probably all just a bunch of pathetic losers that have no life.
<LI>I think it is just fine that it is out there.  People can't be sheltered from reality forever.
<LI>sex on the net is open and available everywhere, parents need to educate their children appropriately and correctly about sex. Sex is not dirty or perverted, it is only those who induldge in those activities that gives sex a negative image. Sex is positive and the internet takes advantage of hunamities interest in sex. Parents need to explain and discuss sex, hopefully the kids will understand and they will eventually grow up and can make their own decisions.
<LI>Mild pornography is easily come across but hardcore needs mor work to find.
<LI>Haven't seen much yet. Probably will haave to reserve my opinion until I see more of it.
<LI>can't control it. can't fight it. use your brains. learn about the "off" button.
<LI>IT'S COOL!!!
<LI>it is o.k.
<LI>Sex on the net should be an extremely minor consideration when it comes to determining what should be on there.  My kids are on the net when I'm in the house, and often when I'm in the room with them.  They cannot be on the net when I am not home, and this is a very easy rule to enforce and even easier to see if it's been followed.  Parents who don't monitor their kids are loser parents.
<LI>I LIKE IT!  FREEDOM OF SPEECH!
<LI>It think it is a great outlet for people to seek out their curiosites HONESTLY, about their sexual preferences, frustrations, etc.
<LI>I think it is good for people who desire to use it (sex on the net)
<LI>Sex on the Net is still about information (where it is, how to get it, etc) , and any censorship should be left to the individual about how to deal with it, or to the parents/guardians of minors.
<LI>I run a relationships site, and the net & sex were made for each other
<LI>It's hard to do with just a mouse, and it keeps shorting out my keyboard
<LI>It's ok for adults but i feel it is the parents/guardians responsibility to monitor their children's viewing.
<LI>Clean and safe
<LI>I THINK IT WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF ALL IF PARENTS WERE TO DECIDE WHETHER THEIR CHILDREN SHOULD OR SHOULDNT SEE SEX, SINCE IT WOULD NOT ONLY PREVENT US THAT WISH TO SEE IT TO FIND CENSORED SITES, AS IT WOULD CUT THE PAYING SITES, AND BETTER YET, EACH PARENTS COULD DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHAT WOULD BE BEST FOR THEIR KIDS.
<LI>ok
<LI>I believe it is great. We need more erotic pictures on the net. It needs to be monitored more closely by parents and teachers to make sure children aren't looking where they shouldn't.
<LI>sex is great; American prudishness is a perversion. sexual relationships online is 'simulator training' and satisfaction. Go sex!
<LI>infomative
<LI>I think that is for everyones best intrests,  keep it on the net
<LI>Just like everything else in life, it is best in moderation. It's a way for people to address their curiosity in a fairly safe way. You find what you look for, but we should be free to choose for ourselves.
<LI>Sex and internet does not correlate to each other directly, however, what to do to prevent abuse of the net is to monitor it's activity. One example is for parents to monitor their child activity. It might help to do that. Starting from good communication may help.
<LI>I love it. I do it all the time and masturbate to it. Everyone should do it.
<LI>Terrific!
<LI>It is what people make it. When people are moral, it is...When they are not, it is not.
<LI>Tghe internet should not be censored as a whole but monitored either by parents or specific ISP's that cater to those offended by pornography. Also parents can monitor pornography through one the the many freely available software monitoring systems.
<LI>Love it...full filling
<LI>cool
<LI>I think that sex on the net has helped me to pleasure my partner better.
<LI>I think sex is everywhere. It is up to society to teach and promote understanding, oppenness and educate, not to limit or censor. If a child is in a home with a computer, it is up to the parents to monitor the child. There is nothing wrong with curiosity, and if the child is aiming to find something, they will find it somewhere other than the Internet.  One should not censor, one should educate. 
<LI>There are many benefits to the "openess" of the sexual content of the net.  Many people can express their desires in a manner that is safe and free.
<LI>Freedom of speech, o.k with me
<LI>awesome
<LI>I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH IT AND IF OTHERS DO THEN THEY SHOULD JUST STAY AWAY FROM IT.
<LI>ok
<LI>I enjoy it because in a release for me beings I am unattached at the moment and it is a lot safer than going out and meeting some for a short while
<LI>I believe that, regarding sex on the internet, it is an individual's right to find whatever they want. Parents should monitor their children and be aware of what they are surfing and not blame the internet but themselves if the kids find"inappropriate mat
<LI>The internet is akin to the phone system. Users have the right to discuss and display whatever they want to. I am in favor of having <I>select</I> providers which block explicit material. </I> 
<LI>I wish I Knew how to access more online sex chat and contacts relevent to my area so I might meet someone 
<LI>I Love It!!!
<LI>want to find out more about beastiality
<LI>Aint seen much yet
<LI>I think its ok to have sex stuff on the net. Some of it is actually educational...
<LI>its great place, wish it wasn't so protected
<LI>great
<LI>sex is a basic need and internet can be media for better sex
<LI>i love sex and\on the net
<LI>i don't mind it, parents should be aware of what they're kids are doing.
<LI>Don't know much about it, but ain't nothing like the real thing.  For those that find it good for them, enjoy.
<LI>The amount of sexual material is surprising.
<LI>KEEP IT CLEAN AND LEAGL.....
<LI>I don't care one way or the other
<LI>It's good but a little time consuming. 
<LI>USA must realise that they have no mandate to enforce their dubious morality on the rest of the world.
<LI>Love it, It is not harmful and I believe that it promotes healthy communications
<LI>I met my current girlfriend through IRC.  
<LI>the net should not be regulated ,free speech is part of our constitution
<LI>Mixed feelings..Adults should have access, but better controles are a must.
<LI>Censorship begins and ends at home
<LI>i am interested in infantilism not much to show??
<LI>it had better days
<LI>sex is the internet
<LI>A great way to bring sex out into the open.
<LI>Sex is just a part of life... like the rest of the internet... so stop having a cow!
<LI>I don't really understand the concept of Cybersex.  It seems too silly to me, I'd rather be up close and personal, but some people prefer distance, and it is safer, so I don't think it's neccessarily wrong.  I don't really care if there is pornography on the net, because you do have be more specific when you look it up, and there are warnings when you get there.  I am very against children witnessing pornography, but some sex sites should be availiable for kids, especially teens who may have questions 
hat they don't feel comfortable asking someone they know.  Sometimes it's easier to ask a perfect stranger.  So, I'm 18, and still a virgin.  It doesn't bother me to be a virgin; i'd like to have sex, but I can't just do it with anyone.  I'm not saving myself for marriage or anything, just someone who I would feel comfortable giving a peice of my life to.
<LI>for it but parents need to regulate it
<LI>People need more sex. the US is very sexually deprived and most people are bitter and full of smame about sex.
<LI>I think sex on the net is wholesome for our own sexuality,  coming to grips with who we are!
<LI>I think sexual material on the internet is basically harmless. People should just lighten up and take responsibility for they're own actions.
<LI>I thinks its great!!!!!
<LI>It's nice to act out all fantasy with out fear of ridicule
<LI>It a perfect place to see and read things you want to know.
<LI>I HAVE NO IDEA!
<LI>what is the big deal it is on tv radio and in the movies too.
<LI>It is reflective of our actual society
<LI>LITTLE IF ANY VALUE IN LOCATING PEOPLE OR SUBJECTS 
<LI>I think it is fine
<LI>I think it is good for people that need this kind of material to have a safe way of accessing it.
<LI>I like it. It gives me thing's to try with my wife.
<LI>I love sex on the net, althought it has cost me my marriage by my wife meeting someone on the net and had a affair
<LI>No comment.
<LI>It is good for those who pursue it!
<LI>hot
<LI>There are several sites that encourage the making of destructive devices and explain how to use them to hurt people. I would rather have a kid looking at a nude female rather than learning how to kill and mame people.
<LI>OK by me, I enjoy it, but a simple lock out for children should be intiated.
<LI>It's not a big deal
<LI>I applaud the efforts taken so far to limit access. I would like to see very hard material available more but with coding of sites as to content.
<LI>it's good!
<LI>I think that sex is there and if you want to find it, OK, if not dont access it.
<LI>--------------------------------------------
<LI>I wish there were more pictures.But I'm an adult and can do what I like. Children looking at porn on the Internet is another matter. It should be regulated.Less naked women,more naked men Yeh!
<LI>Cool. This is the way information should be. Free, safe, and exciting. Regulation should be considered akin to book burning and a violation of our civil rights in America.
<LI>Might be interesting.  I'm new to the net and still exploring.  Always open for new adventures.
<LI>the internet was provided so that people could communicate and sex has alot to do with communication i dont think that porn or other sex related things should be banned they should just be rated and as for the audience of such things if a child is smart enough to get on the internet and get into contact with the pages which contain sexual content then i think their old enough to see what the internet has to offer
<LI>sex is very personal and not up to anyone to say yes or no except those participating on a consensual basis.
<LI>It's fun, harmless, & I'll continue as long as I can
<LI>To each their own.
<LI>Parents need to raise their kids, not the government
<LI>i love it it helps me out
<LI>too cool, let it keep comming.
<LI>I think it's a great way to access materials that you'd not normally view or purchase elsewhere.
<LI>For informational purposes, usefull.  To support vices, destructive morally to the individual and thus society as a whole.
<LI>Dont know much, would like to
<LI>I think sex on the Internet is something good; I know that I have opened myself up to ideas and fantasies that I hadn't thought about before, and I have accepted that I _have_ those feelings and fantasies, rather than surpressing them at all costs.
<LI>The Internet is a microcosm of society...it reflects what true freedom is and should be...parents and guardians should live up to their responsibilities and safeguard their children from harm in any given situation, whether it's the Net or just crossing the street.
<LI>Go look at the news groups
<LI>it is like magazines
<LI>good idea
<LI>What's the problem? Repressed Anlo-Saxon hangups overridden
<LI>I think sex and the internet is a grate learning tool..
<LI>i don't have a problem with it
<LI>I think that it is great that there is a place for people to expresses themseles. It only needs to be regarded for what it is. 
<LI>I think its fine for single people.  But, after a lot of soul searching I decided (for me anyway) that it is really no different than adulterly.  Not in deed but in intent.
<LI>i love masturbating to it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I think it's good and should be easily limited by the person who owns the PC or is the subscriber
<LI>Cool!
<LI>Sex is a beautiful thing that should be shared by two people that love each other. With pornograpy as ramped on the internet as it is today, I fear what the next generation will be like socially. No one will everhave to meet in person just a bunch of mindless perverts that get all sexually frustrated and run out and rape the first woman they see.
<LI>I think that sex on the internet is not necessarily a bad thing.  It is all in how you look at it.  For some it is a way to get rid of sexual tension instead of visiting a prostitute or maybe raping a woman.  I would rather think of a man getting his kicks by masterbating to an unknown voice and getting rid of the tension instead of stalking young girls to get rid of it.  I think people need to wake up and realize that it really is a good outlet.  It beats just shutting our eyes and pretending that per
erts don't exsist.
<LI>I LIKE IT 
<LI>It should be allowed to remain protected as free speech.  On the other hand, the onis of reggulation should be left to the parents, and not a governmental body.
<LI>i think it`s wery good, but i haven`t found a picture of a girl in wet pants yet. I am sure it`s here somewhere.
<LI>It has no value to society--should it be protected
<LI>Its great
<LI>It is the same as if you watch something on television, you must "change the channel" to obtain  sexual content material.  It does not just out at you when you plug in a computer.
<LI>its fun just trying to hunt it down
<LI>the same as: sex and life....
<LI>wow
<LI>I like it occasionally. It makes me masturbate and get a hard-on! I haven't "cum" yet, but I want to! But, since I fell I am too young to have sex, and I have no girfriend, I masturbate alot. I wish my penis was bigger, though, but I'm only 15 and I get the job done. I am curcumsized. I think Sex and the Internet should be free speech, but parents/legal guardians should restrict access of this nature to their children.
<LI>i think it is great and i should be more easy acsess
<LI>Quality material is hard to find. Services that have good tast (moderate pornography) are hard to find
<LI>i think it is a great sexual outlet and information tool
<LI>To each his own
<LI>I wish there was more
<LI>i really like it
<LI>it's great should be more!!!!
<LI>Sex is in the eyes of the beholder, and should be left open to the public.  There are enough programs out there for parent to download for free, to keep their children from looking at sexual materials.
<LI>I think that sex on the Internet is out of hand, but is a right of the surfer to have it availible and not censored. People who take offence to such material are not forced to look at it or to find it, thus it is the responcibility of the browser to determine what is appropriate for themselves.
<LI>Can be very informative and entertaining.
<LI>It's a cool easy way to access porn and talk to sex people
<LI>I think these people are perverted
<LI>it is MY responsibility to stop MY children from viewing pornography on the internet.  NOT THE GOVERNMENT !!!
<LI>It is very stimulating, you can see things out of the ordinary and it is exciting!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I love it. I get off every night!!
<LI>nothing wrong with it should stay
<LI>My boyfriend likes looking up sex stuff better than me.
<LI>I think it's become very commercial
<LI>It's a healthy addition to a relationship and a good source of arousal when you haven't got one!
<LI>if it comes to the real thing you have to pay for it
<LI>I honestly think its a great way to have safe sex
<LI>It's quite interesting
<LI>If taken with a grain of salt and the right speriat then leave it a lone. Let the partents take back the controll of the family and keep outsiders out
<LI>it is great but i wish i could see more hard core porno!!
<LI>There are times I enjoy the access and feel that I should have the choice of what I view.
<LI>ITS GREAT,SAFE,AND FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>IT SHOULD NOT BE FOR SALE
<LI>I love sex. Anywhere.
<LI>Nothing wrong
<LI>Its great!!!!
<LI>It could be better, wish there was more of it I enjoy it.
<LI>I think it is great, it has awoke something I thougth was gone...
<LI>LOVE IT !!!1
<LI>The only way to overcome local "community standards" controls of the right wing fundamentalists
<LI>Great place to let off a little frustration and to explore areas that I've been curious about.
<LI>I think of sex on the internet as I think of a sleeze porno book store ... :-)
<LI>Too accessible.
<LI>Can be a fun way to get off when you didn't find the right partner at the bar or are too tired to go out!
<LI>I find it ironic that the people who are most easily offended are also the ones that try the hardest to find the things that offend them. Freedom isn't just for people you approve of, it's for everyone. Be careful what you wish for, you just might get more than you were ready for...
<LI>I like it, its a great way to pass time.
<LI>I think that sex is a private matter, and it should be kept that way.  Who really wants to hear about the good time everyone else is having?
<LI>good
<LI>It is great.
<LI>Yes, I've had sex with someone I met on the Internet, but it wasn't right away.  We dated for 1 month beforehand and we are now engaged to be married.
<LI>Highly Addictive
<LI>non event
<LI>Cheaper than porno movies and magazines.
<LI>Its AWESOME, LETS YOU EXPLORE ANYTHING THAT TURNS YOU ON!AWESOME, ALOWS YOU YOU TO EXPLORE ANYTHING THAT TURNS YOU ON!
<LI>open to consenting adults.  Parents control their own beliefs. 
<LI>it is a good and private source of fun/entertainment for all
<LI>I think it is a safe way for people who have diverse appetites to find a way to satisfy their desires without harming anyone.  I would never approve of harming or forcing children into sex, but I started at 8 yo and have had a fulfilling sex life and have raised two children who are normal hetereosexuals.
<LI>It is kind of fun. Hardcore is pretty boring but erotic stories are nice.
<LI>Personally, I think that sex through the Internet is probably one of the only safe ways of having sex anymore withough the worries of getting AIDS or other STD's.  I think that it is a great way to express one's inner desires and true feelings, without having to really "face" others.  We can use it like a "mask" that allows us to be more true to our sexual instincts and desires.  I don't think that children should be exposed to it, especially the young.  Although, I think that it should be made availab
e to those who want it for personal purposes.  I believe that it can lead to the "demoralization" and "degregation" of others if used improperly.  Of course, a spoon could also be considered a dangerous thing if put in the wrong hads and used improperly.
<LI>I'm all for both.
<LI>should be more free porn and no age checking
<LI>It's there, it won't go away and it's not a big deal
<LI>There are too many sex phoneline advertisements.
<LI>more free ads ,less 900 #s
<LI>i think its a good place for people to experience their fantasies in a virtual situation, its good for chatting, and learning more about yourself.  i personally love it
<LI>My wife and I both enjoy looking for sex on the internet
<LI>I've been disappointed with what I've found (or not found)
<LI>It's great. If you don't want it, don't find it.
<LI>good
<LI>Sex is everywhere in'Chat' places--you can usually distinguish the kids from the adults there, it's just that no one is usually watching (the webmasters) to censor this.  I can get onto a movie chat, and there will be no talk of movie, only sex.  Sometimes people add nude pictures onto it--it's too easy for kids.  But then again they do have to learn it all from somewhere...
<LI>Wish it were not so hard to find.
<LI>it압  great 
<LI>I think it is great!
<LI>it shouldn't be censored because of different standards in different contries. Maybe applications like surfwatch and the like are the answer.
<LI> i use nets to get all the animals i have sex with
<LI>The issue is blown way out of proportion to reality.
<LI>How many % of the worlds children speak english? and even if they do they should be able to HAVE FUN on the net. The only disadvantage with this  line of thought is that your computer won't be available to yourself anymore. 
<LI>I would love to do it so manybe I would find someone that would love my ways 
<LI>I've learned alot about sex that my parents never taught me.  I've also took what I've learned and played around w/ it (so to speak) and I think me and my boyfriend are closer and have more fun.  The Internet is a good way to express your self in a way that you can't in society.
<LI>IT'S OK, BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE TO SUBSCRIBE TO IT & PAY
<LI>It's Great
<LI>to soon to tell- i am a new user
<LI>I think its turned this country into a immoral nation... that is spiritually sick!
<LI>Would buy some materials(considered taboo, if I knew that it was not a police sting
<LI>I believe that censership should be left up to the individual.  Parent should be responsible for their children.
<LI>for the most part it is harmless.  there are a few exceptions that can be ignored.  if it becomes too much of a problem most services have options to suspend offensive users.
<LI>It's safer I guess, but a little ridiculous as well.  It cannot compare to real sex.
<LI>Children should not have access to porn. Parents do your job, know what your children doing.
<LI>the foot fetish stuff is great a real revelation that there are so many of us.
<LI>I'm sure it's there if any one looks hard enough, but it's probably easier to find as 'traditional' magazines, videos, phone lines etc.
<LI>I have an active sex life and enjoy women and images the Internet provides.
<LI>It is only there if you want to see it and if you want to see it why not have a look - kids and animals is a bit wierd though and should not have services provided for - this sounds like a restriction on freedom but then both are illegal anyway
<LI>hailarus
<LI>i love it
<LI>I love it!  The more the better! Keep it 'up' I always say. ;-)
<LI>All for it. The net started as a free exchange of ideas. Don't muzzle it for any reason!
<LI>I MASTERBATE TO IT AND USE THE PICTURES AS A MODEL TO MY SEX
<LI>Although mind expanding, and allows people to explore their own sexuality, I think some form of restriant is needed.  It allows people to be a little too free with their experimentation and almost encourages people to push the limits.
<LI>the sex is in mind / age is not important / frbidding smth. makes it underground and uncontrolled (I mean psychos etc)
<LI>The net should be free access to any sex related items.  A rating system might help.  Also, if sex is on the net, then it should not be sold like so many addresses are when requiring a subscription.
<LI>I enjoy it thouroughly
<LI>Cool.  I found my marriage mate through the net.
<LI>I keeping with the idea that the 'net' should be an open forum and sex is as part of nature as eating and breathing, I feel that no goverment censorship should exist among the net.
<LI>I THIMK THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE MORE STUFF FOR WOMEN WHO ENJOY NOTHING BUTT NAKED MEN AND ENCOUNTERS WITH MEN AND WOMEN. THEY SHOULD ALSO GET STUFF FROM PLAGIRL AND THE CHIPPENDALES SO THEY CAN PLASTER ALL OVER THE INTERNET. I THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH MATERIAL WITH NOTHING BUTT NAKED WOMEN TO LAST A LIFETIME. REAL WOMEN WANT MORE MEN THAT WE CAN GET TO EASILY AND QUICKLY!!
<LI>love it
<LI>The internet is probably the easiest place for parents to monitor their children's activity--stop trying to make ME babysit other people's kids!
<LI>I don`t involve myself with it at this point in time
<LI>It isnt a big deal, parents should take the responsibility and the government should stay out!
<LI>IT is great that you can find difference of opions
<LI>Nowhere near the real thing, thank God!
<LI>very interesting
<LI>I want to have it! But no children-sex!
<LI>Leave it there
<LI>Great
<LI>its natural act that should not be hidden away an inquiring mind
<LI>Interesting and intriging
<LI>Great source of knowledge
<LI>Well, it takes people out of reality for a while.... its just too irresponsible right now, a government body shouldn't have to regulate this shit, if these people were so smart they would do that themselves 
<LI>It is just like buying a steamy noval or the nude magazines
<LI>I enjoy  it
<LI>I think there should be more free hardcore sites on the net
<LI>I think its great and there should be more!
<LI>Rather overdone
<LI>I never knew that there were so much material about Infantilism here! WERY GOOD!!!
<LI>I feel it is a great outlet & no one can get hurt. 
<LI> think it is a ideal mechanism for meeting people anonimously
<LI>it is what one makes of it, no one should be told they cant, those who say that are the biggest ones who do use it and dont want others to have the right to, ( they like to control people)
<LI>sex should be on the internet it is america and it is part of life
<LI>There's not enough Rush Limbaugh porn
<LI>I love it.  My husband works long hours and I regularly converse with a man overseas.  It's safe and harmless and allows me to burn off a little frustration.
<LI>I think it's sooo great!  The only reason that I wanted to get on the Internet was so I could download things to masturbate to.  It's great because now I can get ANYTHING that I want to look at.  I tell you, there's not a night when I'm at home when I don't jack-off to something I got on-line.  And my mom doesnt' even care!
<LI>You have to pay for the good stuff.
<LI>The only thing that worries me is the fact that pedophily is too largely allowed.  Children need more protection, being lax on the net about this might unfortunately reduce the importance of children sex abuse in some peoples minds.
<LI>Interisting, but could be much better.
<LI>It's overrated by religous zealots.  Perhaps they want to keep it to themselves!!
<LI>I think censoring the internet violates the 1st Amendment 
<LI>It's a great idea for adults.
<LI>awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>the net should be free of cencership because the public pays for it, not the government
<LI>I think it's great.I have been calling "sex sites" for years and will continue to do so.
<LI>I think it can be fun.
<LI> i find it very interesting and exciting
<LI>it sucks
<LI>I haven't seen too much, but I hope you don't have to download everything!
<LI>Fuck the CDA! ;>
<LI>Its great to see such wide openess, without stuffy politicians sticking their noses in !
<LI>good!!!!
<LI>most of whats there is no worse than kids could get from their friends or buy from a convenience store.  Cybersex with a stranger is kind of wierd, though.
<LI>TOO MANY BAIT ADS WITH NO SUBSTANCE OR FOR MONEY
<LI>LOVE SEX, INTERNET=Open Minded Intelligent, GOOD!!!
<LI>Sex and Internet? A media'story !
<LI>It is fantastic!
<LI>I enjoy it.  I wish I could find a good cyber lover.
<LI>I think that sex on the internet is just another way people can express themselves.  No government or provider should tell us what it is right and wrong, it's up to the individual.
<LI>I like being able to sit down at the computer and be able to view pictures and read stories with sexual content.  It's cheaper than buying dirty mags and just as fulfilling.
<LI>You can't get AIDS on the Internet.
<LI>Educational.  Entertaining.  Outlet for sexual frustration.
<LI>wasted time
<LI>I think you can find things if you are looking for it, but it is not easy.
<LI>I think that sex is perfectly natural, and if the government wants to censor something censor violence
<LI>Sex can be a wonderful thing, But our right wing christian groups want to take any and all things that bring enjoyment to the masses away. Why ? Because they are closet perverts and are anal retentive.
<LI>if i want to see it, it is there and i enjoy looking
<LI>It should all be free!  I'm not going to pay for anything like that.  That would be prostitution!  That's bad!
<LI>I think it's great,I'm recently divorced and not having much luck finding a new partner because I'm over-weight.  The internet gives me an outlet for my sexual frustration.  After 23 years of marriage, it's rough being without a sex partner.
<LI>I believe that as adults anyone should be able to put any type of pages up that do hurt others. Cotroled by some code system to alert guardian software.
<LI>You should put a few men next to those women down there.
<LI>Just beginning to find out
<LI>harmless to the majority, as with any subject extremists expolit the weak
<LI>almost as good as real life
<LI>In a way, it's like the magazine rack. Don't pick it up if you don't want to look at it. But unfortunatley, pages don't always have a "cover" that lets you know what your getting into. That's why I would favor a rating system.
<LI>too general need specific input sites
<LI>Ask a question about incest!
<LI>it is a good change to look at once in a while
<LI>It is a good tool if you are the shy type.
<LI>Great,but would like to see more for women to enjoy.
<LI>Human Sexuality is everyones instinct. Knowledge promotes responsibility. Would rather see violence off the Net than sexuality. Promote love, not hate.
<LI>i love it
<LI>IT IS GRRRREAT!!!!!!
<LI>I don't see why so many people are worried about it. unless you know where to look, you don't see it.  If you have people around whom you don't want accessing that type of info, then prevent that from happening with either a censor or whatever.  It causes no problem to be made available for those who want it, and know how to look for it.
<LI>The Internet should remain an open source for all kinds of information. Children will find what they want if parents do not take an active part in their lives. The only people that miss consored material are older folks who don't know how to get around it. Keep goverment out!
<LI>hard to find.would like to explore it.
<LI>Content control at the server level at user's request.
<LI>Most of the sex on the internet i OK and should be legal.
<LI>Well, I know there's a lot of porn out there and that a lot of people are outraged about that.... SO WHAT!? I don't like hardcore porn either... SO I DON'T GO TO PAGES THAT HAVE IT. About cyber-sex I find it a bit ridiculous, but hey, it's a free world out there.
<LI>Interesting
<LI>educational, but don't want sicko's to go out and harm people.
<LI>I think it's great!
<LI>very entertaining if that is what you are looking for.
<LI>meeting whit other girls for sex
<LI>I find nothing wrong with it. I have found that it has given me a chance to explore subjects I would not or could not explore in public. 
<LI>need more hard core sex talk one on one!
<LI>if you NEED to find sex on the internet your a real loser
<LI>This Telecommunication Act of 1996 is a bunch of hooey!
<LI>I can't find personal ads.
<LI>As long as we have freedom in this country, you should have the right to look at anything you want as long as you don't offend someone who's with you. If a person doesn't want to look at sex on the net or in public they don't have too. I have seen warnings in every net and in magazines saying that if you are offended: DON"T GO ANY FARTHER:  Of course if they didn't look then they couldn't BITCH!
<LI>I think: If you want to find it you will...but there is no way of finding it unless you want to.  There should be a law against pedofilia and other related newsgroups on the net!
<LI>good start 
<LI>Not all people like it but I am against censorship of any kind.
<LI>If you're over 18, and it's your choice, viva la difference!
<LI>right on
<LI>Sex is great!!!
<LI>I think sex on the chat lines gets a gross. People come on to chat with names that belong to the genitalia. It's kinda gross. 
<LI>I think it is good for those looking for it, those who are into a lifestyle that uses the content, and those who are curious of such a lifestyle
<LI>I think the govt needs to stay the fuck out of peoples business 
<LI>it's information that shouldn't be put aside
<LI>I think it's a good, healthy thing. I think anything should be available (labelled appropriately with warnings), and that children should not be allowed access to the *whole* internet without parental consent.
<LI>I think that it incourages masturbation skills and helps children with their sexual idenity
<LI>Not why I tried Internet, but the reason why I stayed, mostly.
<LI>i like it
<LI>I think its great...if these lazy-ass parents would watch their kids instead of waiting for everyone else to raise them, there wouldn't be all of these old FUCKS, who don't know what the hell a computer even is, killing the freedom of the net!!!
<LI>I think that the moral majority is turning the access to the internet, and a few places that do offer the pern, ar getting raked over the coals about it.  It is the person who operates the mouse whou should dictate where they go, and not have interference place upon us by the government.  Things are regulated too much allready, and this is another tactic by beaurocrats to tie up one of our freedoms in a court litigation, etc.
<LI>I am able to scratch an itch that I haven't been able to before.  
<LI>I think that if things like racism are not banned on the net, why should sex be!  It is a free world!
<LI>I'm from the old school -- it belongs behind closed doors between the two participants only.
<LI>it ok
<LI>I don't see much because I really don't look for it.  I'd hate to sse a lot of it on the internet, because most of it would be submitted by people who are frustrated and unhappy, and this is NOT the kind of sexual material that has any value.
<LI>IT GREAT AND GIVES ME A WOOD
<LI>Withhold comment until I have had more time to explore the services offered. Initial "cold eyes" observation is that I like having the option to go where I want, when I want and I do not feel the least bit "judged" by the values of others! I have found that I am not alone in my sexual desires!
<LI>Sounds like fun.
<LI>Leave it on the internet. It is parents and legal guardians' responsibilities to montior children's activities on the net.
<LI>It should be available to adults but not to children and that does not mean physical age but emotional age as determined by parents. It's time in this country for parents to take responsibillity for their childrens actions instead of school,police&court systems to do their job for them. Please pardon my spelling.
<LI>some informative/alot very stupid
<LI>Overrated
<LI>It can encourage positive things: very safe sex, open communication...but its just interactive pornography, nothing REAL, and people shouldn't take it too seriously. At the most, its only talking dirty.
<LI>No censorship- the net should be completely open.  Parents can control their children with special filtering software; everything else should be an adult's choice.
<LI>I'm mostly housebound these days & would love it if someone came up with a way to have PHYSICAL stimulation over the net!
<LI>KOOL
<LI>There wouldn't be so much controversy if people were not interested in sex.  Sex is human, natural and fun (yes, dangerous, but you have to regulate risks).  Sex and the Net is inevitable, people need to just get over their inhibitions and let everyone else enjoy their life.
<LI>Mostly ok... but do not approve of sexual material which includes minors...
<LI>I liked it the way it was!
<LI>The true value of the internet lies in its non-regulation. As soon as censorship becomes normal on the net, much of its use will disappear.
<LI>No censorship!!  If someone doesn't want to see something, then don't look at it.  If you don't want your kids to see it then watch over them or get a censorship chip.
<LI>while entertaining, it could cause problems for young children and their new problems that are occuring around them.  They are especially prone to do things are somewhat abnormal because of their age.
<LI>I REALLY LOVE IT
<LI>Have to pay too see the good sites.
<LI>There are too many naked women and not enough males.  
<LI>I like it
<LI>great
<LI>i love it!
<LI>Sex on the Net is great... it's completely safe and it's fun.  It's nowhere near the real thing, but it doesn't have any drawbacks or concerns that you have to worry about such as preganancy or STD's.
<LI>Good
<LI>It's been great for me to get answers to some areas of sexual interest that I have.  I have new ways to explore my feelings and desires that I've always had but never understood.
<LI>It is too difficult to find and view exotic sexual material.  Otherwise it is pretty fun!
<LI>it's hot
<LI>Men, transexual, bisex
<LI>I think SEX ON THE NET is a topic that is much too early to 
<LI>sex is something that doesn't go out of style it should be dealt with by adults
<LI>I am dialing from the US where sex is considered a terrorist act
<LI>It압 easy, no embarrasment involved, since only I know what I앐 really doing. It압 good, as long as children don앖 get their hands on really discusting stuff. But that is their parents problems, not the authorities.
<LI>Too perversion orientated, too little emphasis placed on the erotic
<LI>I think sex and the internet are pretty cool but I can't seem to find any good sex online communications to talk to someone live but over the computer
<LI>sex on the inter net is a help to maney teen boys thay do not get ronge info thay get the true info on sex to make up thare own mind
<LI>Don't people realize that government  regulation of the net is one step towards losing individual freedom? The government  will be parents to our children . that's our job.
<LI>Can provide a wonderful pasttime.
<LI>I think that sex on the net should be allowed as an outlet and as simple enjoyment.
<LI>It helps to keep fire burning
<LI>I think that the Internet is a great place to discover, view, and talk about things that you wouldn't normally.  I hate censorship, and think that the Net should be open.
<LI>All for it.
<LI>I think it is immoral and most discusting.  I think it is just sick!!
<LI>take it for what it is.....an area to experiment
<LI>over rated
<LI>Too bad, the dark side of human nature seems to get glorified.
<LI>I think it's a great idea. It has helped many people I know to reveal what they are really looking for in sex. It's not embarrassing
<LI>It RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
<LI>Love it, want more
<LI>why push for reality when fantasy is soo satisfying?
<LI>Where humankind goes, so goes sex. Why should the net be different?
<LI>I think the GOV should keep their hands out of my businessss!
<LI>I believe that is shold be banned from the Internet, it serves no value at all.
<LI>I think its an individual's right to see what they want.
<LI>i like it!!!!!!!!!!1
<LI>Any attempt by American politicians to censor, or otherwise inhibit communication on the Internet is useless. Period.  The Internet is not a U.S. entity.  There is no reason to create new laws to deal with the Internet, since there are already laws govern
<LI>It's amazing how much there is. But you do have to lok for it.
<LI>Its there like in any other place too. One has to go and find where it is, if one wants to look at it. And anyway what's so bad about it? There are things that are worse.
<LI>No comment.
<LI>I don't see any problem with sex on the Net.  Let people have their fu
<LI>Lots around.  Parents need to practice 'Parenting' to keep their kids off of the sex stuff on the internet.
<LI>I was very surprised by the question about sexual activities on the Net. I see very little, am online quite a bit. Judging from the other questions, I have a really boring sex life.
<LI>that's okey
<LI>I think its great
<LI>I think the government should stay out of the bedroom.
<LI>yeah, yeah.  More, more.
<LI>works for me
<LI>Mr. Harris likes it
<LI>IT is a private, in-your-own-home way to find new things! 
<LI>i love it and hope it stays
<LI>I have no problems or complants about sex on the internet; it should be the parents/guardians responsiblity to monitor, watch what their children do on the internet.
<LI>No real big deal; not any worse than dable T.V. here in .ca land...
<LI>I seem to have a hard time finding the things I'm interested in.
<LI>I  am  totally  against  censorship  of  sexual  content  on  the  internet.
<LI>It can be very scary.  I mean look around.  I've seen topics such as death/snuff sex.  Thats scary.  On the other hand, netsex can be fun and exciting.
<LI>a let down!
<LI>I like sex. I like internet.
<LI>A nice complement to RL sex
<LI>Sex on the Internet is a great release for older people.
<LI>Humans are sexual creatures. The net is a HUGE melting pot of humanity. I have no problem with any of it.
<LI>I see no problem in continuing to contain graphic material on the internet.
<LI>sex on the internet keeps disease out the bedroom!!
<LI>It is very interesting!

<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_SOL -->
<LI>The net should be completely open and get the government out of our lives.
<LI>If you dont like what you see, dont look.
<LI>Programs to put an adult lock on adult sites available through internet providers (preferably for free) and let PARENTS monitor what their children see!!!
<LI>home monitoring and enforcement of undesired subject matter
<LI>It's very simple. If they don't like it, don't look at it.
<LI>if you don't like it don't look for it ! you gotta put in an effort to find it !!
<LI>Free porn for everyone!!!!!!!!
<LI>parents could buy SurfStreet browser for $30!
<LI>X Rated Material Should be allowed on the net! 
<LI>Incarcerate the whining morons trying to run our lives.   ( ! )
<LI>Open net - those opposed need not subscribe ie Parental control
<LI>I feel that the individual should be responsible for what is seen on  the net.  And that parents be responsible for their own children.
<LI>Let it continue.  Better let socially uncorrect and unaccepptible acts happen here in cyber space than in reality where they do damage and you can not as easerly switch it off if it gets too much 
<LI>Increase the use of (and increase the security of) adult verification schemes such as AdultCheck, etc.
<LI>If people don't want to see it, then don't go looking for it.
<LI>Create a "Kiddie-Net" and get children off the Internet
<LI>Do not censor, encourage use of filtering software & services.
<LI>Provide software for parents to "lock" certain sites
<LI>Parent should be responsible for their children
<LI>launch a heavy political campaign against censors
<LI>Individuals should regulate their exposure, and their children's exposure, to content they found offensive.  A rating system *may* help, but is ultimately harder to enforce than establishing house rules for each individual's household.
<LI>OY, I'M A PERVERTED OLD MAN WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? 
<LI>allow parents to lock out sites to thier own children
<LI>I think most "mature" adults can make thier own decisions on what they want to access on the "net", as far as children are concerned, I think you should ask one of the child's parents.(hopefully they'll be one of the "mature" adults I spoke of earlier)
<LI>THEY SHOULD NOT VISIT SEX SITES IF IT BOTHERS THEM
<LI>I want to see it all baby
<LI>parents need to decide for their kids-other than that-it's a free world & it should stay that way
<LI>deal with it!!!
<LI>Cnvince the whiners that their concerns are paranoid/luddite delusions
<LI>password-protected sites ? 
<LI>parental controll of their childern
<LI>if they don't like it, keep them and their own children out of it and don't make my decisions for me
<LI>better sensorship to prevent underaged's access
<LI>THE PARENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Monitor your own children
<LI>Parents need to take the responsibility and not request the government to parent for them.
<LI>Adult sites should require age verification and pass word to get on.
<LI>Make parents legally responsible for childrens behavior/viewing on the net
<LI>the only thing that i am opposed to is the kiddyporn it should be banned  
<LI>Net Nanny type regulations; free choice, that's it.
<LI>I like the 'rating system' idea but there should also be parental blocks available to ALL "questionable" sites
<LI>i think that pornography is a beautiful thing and that pedophilia should be legalized because it's erotic to watch young children being fucked by older men with large throbbing penises
<LI>If you don't want you, your wife or your kids to look at it... then don't!
<LI>more whipping boys going down on goats
<LI>The ultimate decision is up to the parent
<LI>Let those who detest sexuality on the 'net avoid sexual 'net sites:
<LI>If you don't want it... Don't open it...!
<LI>Let all be up to the discretion of the user and/or parent with use of such programs as CyberWatch or NetNanny
<LI>tell parents that they need to start being parents again, instead of expecting society to watch the children for them
<LI>Be open but impose a monitoring software where internet is available to children
<LI>Should be a parental responsibility, no one else's.
<LI>Individual choice
<LI>Place a code of random letters on each explicit page that censoring software could regonise, thus keeping censorship up to the individual and avoiding the problem of programs censoring things like breast cancer sites.
<LI>I'm against infringement of rights of any kind.
<LI>parental lock-out codes
<LI>Fuck the Government
<LI>Let parents use SurfWatch or something like that
<LI>establish an difficult method in obtaining sexual content, therefore separating the people who really want the material and the people who do not.
<LI>If you don't like a tv program, you don't watch it, right?  If you don't like broccoli, you don't eat it, right?  If you don't like pornography, yoy probably don't have a subscrition to Buff magaine, right?  If you can't stand the heat then get out of the kitchen!
<LI>Leave people alone and let them have fun
<LI>FUCK THOSE ASSHOLE "GROUPS"
<LI>parents concerned should monitor the activities of their children on the net. They should consider purchasing available screening software.
<LI>tough question. perhaps a separate "web" where anything is ok, and a more restricted one for lusers who "can't handle the truth". people would then self-censor or be e-bombed to death.
<LI>Parents should watch there children not the government
<LI>Provide that info with a password only
<LI>Let each person decide whether it is right for himself
<LI>shut down hard-core, violent pornography (civil rights violations against women)
<LI>There is always going to be porn.  Get a fuckin helmet.
<LI>Allow home users to select and block sites from their machines. 
<LI>parents need to restrict what there children have access to
<LI>parents should monitor their children
<LI>Each person will just have to choose what they want to look at and view...the govt. or whoever can't screen out all pornography just like they will never get all of the drugs off the street. It will always be here.
<LI>Let the individual owner have the technology to censor their individual computer.
<LI>don't make people suffer because of bad parenting!!!!!
<LI>It suould be up to the parents
<LI>completely open, but have safe guards against access to children and schools
<LI>Users need to regulste their own computers
<LI>Blocking devices to exclude children
<LI>parental responsibility
<LI>make them keep bouncing checks........
<LI>ID Porno users for age 
<LI>Let people regulate themselves
<LI>Encourage parents to monitor their children's activities.
<LI>create a system that easly allows users to restrict there own Pc
<LI>Let people keep out of sites they don't like and use the available software to keep their kids out. A rating system would help the software keep new innapropriate sites unavailable.
<LI>Get rid of the internet, it is a tool of the devil. 
<LI>tell them to get a nanny for themselves and leave other people and their rights alone
<LI>completely open, yet with ratings
<LI>Parents should monitor their own children
<LI>only censor at the request of the user (e.g. for sake of children) - otherwise, the NET should be censorship free
<LI>get more for me to see for free
<LI>Teach parents to use cyber patrol or take a interest in what their children are doing on the net!!!!!
<LI>Software should automatically filter out sexual nets but enable a method for adults to over-ride.
<LI>Hello Big Brother and all his agents. ...  PARENTS must be PARENTS !
<LI>If you have censorship it shouldn't matter
<LI>Adult ID to restricted sites
<LI>programs such as SurfWatch.
<LI>Make it harder for kids to access without parents knowledge.
<LI>majority rules (fuck em)
<LI>If you don't like it don't go there!  It's your choice, no one is forcing anyone to read any sexual content. And the parents can restrict what the kids see through Net Nanny, etc.
<LI>YOU SHOULD HAVE TO SUBSCRIBE AND PAY FOR IT
<LI>parental+software guidance for children only
<LI>anyone who opposes opennes on the net may move to another planet
<LI>I am ademently against child porn geared towards the lowest of life forms 
<LI>Everyone who uses the net should have to apply for a licence or register thier page, they should have the right to have access to these pictures, but they should also be held responsible
<LI>Parents should purchase a password protection
<LI>personal software that blocks usage
<LI>Allow parents to turn off certain sites if they so desire
<LI>use the sysems already developed to have the monitoring be done by they individual household
<LI>Open within legal restrictions
<LI>Censor your kids yourself!
<LI>Send in Id and prove your age ( but what is a fair age ? )
<LI>Have parents watch children.
<LI>Parents should monitor thier children and take advantage of internet censoring software.
<LI>v-chip style software
<LI>Parents Responsibility
<LI>Parents need to control their children
<LI>maturbate on their keeboards
<LI>FUCK THE GOV.
<LI>Get government out of our lives
<LI>Adults: Don't look for it.  Children: should be monitored by their parents.  Rest: No restrictions. 
<LI>parental responsibilty
<LI>If you don't want to see it, don't look at it
<LI>Parents should be in control of their children use of the internet.
<LI>by use of passwords etc. regulate access to legimatie adults
<LI>Rating System along with "Net-Nanny" type software
<LI>Parental internet-control software
<LI>get parents to do their job.  Leave everyone else out of it!!!
<LI>should have passwords to get into certain sites
<LI>make the net secure so that young children can't easily access the info
<LI>I think that people shouldn't post a site advetising sex and offer no sex what so ever sex is harmless it's alot of the people who use it that is dangerous
<LI>shot the blue noses my body is mine i do as i please and will not tollatre interfince in my sex life espacaly sice its tottaly by consent ive had yes than my partner said no wheen i wass hafe my dick in and i stoped and thock my dick out !
<LI>The internet is a monster no one can control it.
<LI>freedom of speech, save for already illegal activities (i.e., kiddie porn)
<LI>Parents should monitor their children's net use.
<LI>password for over 21 surfers
<LI>leave up to individual to go there
<LI>I feel it will eventually take care of or destroy itself.
<LI>parents should parent their children, and not let them parent themselves

<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_MYSEX -->
<LI>the best!
<LI>Sex on Internet can be educating
<LI>Don't look at it if you don't like it. Parents should take responsibility for their kids, and everyone else can kiss my ass.  I don't like republicans, but i can't @%#&! ban them.
<LI>i love every bit of it
<LI>Sex on the net is like sex in life, either you are looking for it or you are not.It doesn't find you! Chat areas are more easliy abused and in need of monitoring more than the net itself.
<LI>Sex exists.  What do you think caused the boom in VCR's?  If it wasn't for Adult videos there wouldn't be one in every house, and Blockbuster would never have existed.  The big "problem" is noone has figured out how to make money on Sex.net at a corporate
<LI>Politicians need to get a grip of their own sexuality!
<LI>no comment
<LI>It's no big deal. Sex is everywhere, just turn on a T.V. talk show. Maybe if people would face reality they would realize it's a part of life and most often a healthy way to have some fun.
<LI>Open mindedness and freedom of choice
<LI>Sex is great, but not on the net.
<LI>it should be free to access by adults and manture indivusals
<LI>it's odd, i don't have a lot of experience with it, but it's intriguing.
<LI>haven't had much experience there. kind of strange, though. how do type and masterbate, that must be a good trick! also i think it's a way to avoid real contact and real responsibility. but to each his/her own.each his own
<LI>I'm a libertarian. The government should keep its nose out
<LI>great to have cybersex on the IRC
<LI>I think that sex on the net could act as an educational tool as well as a very good entertainment tool.
<LI>The Internet has been, and should continue to be, the truest example of free speech in the world.
<LI>it's ok
<LI>keep the net free
<LI>It's cool
<LI>I think sex and the internet should go hand in hand!  It is very appropraite, it keeps kooks and wackos off the streets and in their homes...
<LI>Extraordinary- jibber jibber kerplunk kerplunk whoops
<LI>If all sex related sites were required to have some sort of flag, then parents or teachers could block out access to these sites for underage viewers.  To flag your own site would have to be a law enforced by some observing commission (volunteer internet, local government, state government, or maybe federal).  The flags could come in levels of exposer G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17 and  X.  G stands for suitable for very young children, say age 8 and below, where PG stands for suitable viewing between ages 8 a
d 13 (puberty).  All of the URL's or FTP sites would then be assigned a sutiable flag by the monitoring body just like the motion picture monitoring body.  Then access to certain flags could be blocked out.   
<LI>I love it....if it weren't for it, I probably wouldn't be on it!!
<LI>I think adults should be allowed to view what they like.
<LI>Parents need to control access to sexually explicit material concerning their children.
<LI>it's fine as long as it's available to only adults
<LI>it's kinky and I love it.
<LI>it totally kicks ass
<LI>I like sex on the net. I like the privacy on viewing in my own home. I can view what I want and when I want it. I'm just curious about certain things and I can look them up.
<LI>IT's Entertaining.
<LI>it's sad if people have to use it instead of real sex
<LI>it's great
<LI>The majority are been opressed by the right - as usual
<LI>It works to my advantage because I can find out about other people other than myself and in that way improve myself.
<LI>As far as children gaining access, I believe that it really is a non-issue.
<LI>It is highly encouraged.
<LI>Needs more stuff about foot fetishes
<LI>Pointless
<LI>sex is a wonderful thing
<LI>I think it is a personal thing.  I'm sure there is some way to limit under age persons from seeing the pornography but curiosity gets most people
<LI>i think it is silly once you've seen pictures it not that exciting,hard to find specifics
<LI>screw till you puke
<LI>i think some people take it too far
<LI>Rock on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I love it, it gives me a hardon
<LI>No different than walking into your corner store and buying Playboy or Penthouse
<LI>Almost everyone likes sex, so it is natural to find it on th Net
<LI>Too commercial, promotes sex as a business, not as the wonderful experience it can be.
<LI>it is by my observation ok...i do think that children should be able to learn about sex via this but not have access to anything other than ed
<LI>Having sex related sites on the internet is healthy for a variety of reasons. It can be enlightening, entertaining and purely decadent. There is, of course, material that is highly offensive (necrophilia, pedophila and bestiality, for example), but the bad must be taken with the good. The internet may be the most important way to understand sociey as a whole. We can't censor society, so why censor the internet?
<LI>more action videos!  But seriously, hard core pornography is not really all that accesable (I know, I tried!!!!)
<LI>It's cool!
<LI>Not enough surveys, as they are very enjoyable!
<LI>Get the government out of the business of legislating "morality". That power must rest with the individual. It is the Parent's sole resposibility to monitor their own children. 
<LI>I love it - its not easy to go into a shop and buy sex-related stuff - this is much more fun!
<LI>They are both educational and necessary.
<LI>Not enough
<LI>A rating system for parents to block stuff would work like that of satelite TV.
<LI>I think that censorship of any kind is wrong. We should be able choose if we are capable of handling the sexual material on our own.
<LI>I can't get enough!!!
<LI>I think it is not wholesome or productive.
<LI>its there if you have a credit card handy!
<LI>Sex is a part of our being and groups trying to hide it have greater things to hide.
<LI>I love to download beastiality photos on the net
<LI>great
<LI>Easy way to waste alot of time and not accomplish anything
<LI>sex-good. internet-good. sex on the internet-better
<LI>wish there was more.
<LI>I like pictures, wish there were more that were free to view
<LI>Graphic, honest, and liberal
<LI>I want more hard porn, some teens would be nice too.
<LI>The stories are great, but if I want pics I앏l buy a mag or watch a movie.
<LI>freedom of speech is a right - censorship sucks!
<LI>just look
<LI>Listen, if it helps to keep the access available, great, I HATE the thought of ANY government agency watching out FOR ME.  I'll take care of myself.
<LI>basic information
<LI>boring!!!!!!!
<LI>I don't see the harm in sex! What's the big deal here? Sex is as natural as anything else we do.  I don't seem to understand why it would be worse to watch nudity than violence (seen a movie lately?). Watch Kama Sutra with you partner and enjoy the plesure of love and sex...
<LI>I like the most of it...
<LI>I like it a lot
<LI>All I can say is thanks it exists, I can't bring myself to buy playboy or penthouse at the newstand!
<LI>boring
<LI>Too many pay sites. Should be free <grin>
<LI>You can find it on the Net
<LI>let the shit fly!!
<LI>Sex: great!  Internet: I'm not impressed!
<LI>need to be open
<LI>It adds an exciting dimension to crusing the internet
<LI>Sex is part of human culture and I think its ridiculous to try to hide that fact.  I would rather that parents be held responsible for controlling their childrens access to ANY aspect of the NET.  Given a choice I would even let my children look at sex sites than violent sites.  I would also rather them look at playboy than listen to a closed minded religious broadcaster.  He or she can believe what they want but I have the same right!
<LI>It's OK, I cannot understand, why we have to talk so much about this...
<LI>I think that sexual content on the internet is ok.  I think that PARENTS should watch what their kids do.   I mean there is programs that censor the ponographic webb sites.  So, I think that everything should be put back on the net as before.
<LI>it압 okay
<LI>I've done a little research and some of what I've seen is disgusting. But, I do not believe in censorship under any circumstances.
<LI>it is enjoying and open for all who want to have access to it not those who don't like it.
<LI>i think it is a great supply of entertainment
<LI>Its great! You can meet people who just want to fuck your brains out and I LOVE talking dirty to them.
<LI>it has improved my masturbation sessions, isn't really hard to find but hidden enough to give people a free choice of seeing it or not. The only problem is that as a REAL female, loving sex, there too many frustrated guys. I could write a whole story or  opninion about what i would like and what kinda people and chats, but that would take to much space. You can find nice guys, have fun with them and masturbate but they are rather a minority.
<LI>I think its ok ;)
<LI>I thinkthe internet is great, there is always bad mixed in the good
<LI>I think it is wonderful!!
<LI>It,s fine for adults,who can choos to use it.
<LI>I whish i could find more on it i have not found too much
<LI>It is very interesting
<LI>Drugs, budget problems, health care, racial tension, underemployment, education... there are so many more pressing and more difficult issues.  So the politicians gotta have an easy target to make it look like they are doing something....
<LI>I think its perversion, but the government needs to let people make their own decisions.
<LI>It appears to be harmless fun, so far
<LI>I find the general search for companionship a socially acceptable aspect of the net, so since sex is part of that whole, I disagree with censorship. But I find some of this (bestiality, pedophilia and hard core S & M) unwarranted, unnatural and disgusting.
<LI>don't know yet, will find out
<LI>Internet is only a new media, with more possibility
<LI>no comment
<LI>It's a great experience.  It allows me to say things that I wouldn't be able to someone face-to-face.  My wife gets more sleep this way..
<LI>I think its there if you want it
<LI>I'm new at this.  I've found nothing "free" of porographic nature.  The few areas I've searched are (justifiably) asking one to buy a membership. Seems as though this should control  the situation.
<LI>It is a freedom that should be left up to the person or parents, not the gov. or others
<LI>yippee
<LI>Nothing is done on the internet that isn't done in the real world!
<LI>The fear of sex on the net is a case of mass hysteria
<LI>Think ppl looking for cybersex have no life!
<LI>an easy way to have discreet cahts with people that wish to do the same.
<LI>don't think much of it
<LI>great
<LI>Against all form of censorship on the net or usenet.
<LI>freedom of speech
<LI>It is a great way to releave fustrations without any string attached
<LI>It is nice to be able to live out my sex life safely and enjoyabley
<LI>I wish more personal home pages would warn you of sexual content before displaying it.
<LI>I believe that it is the public's right to view this material if they so choose.
<LI>It has been a wonderful improvement to my masturbation!!!
<LI>It's a matter of choice for the individual; To read or not to read that is the question
<LI>Sex is a natural thing and should not be hiden behind closed doors
<LI>what is inappropriate for a teenager on the net?  there is really nothing here that they cannot find somewhere else! 
<LI>I think Internet should be fully open for everybody and everything, Kids should be protected by there parents.
<LI>I love it, although sometimes I spend far too much time scanning around instead of working
<LI>the bill that just passed is horrendous
<LI>As in real life, I think consenting adults should be allowed to do what they wish. As for the children, I feel the government should let mommy and daddy do the parenting.
<LI>we should not fear any human behavior
<LI>interesting
<LI>it wouldn't be a problem if parents would get a clue, and do what they are supposed to do... watch their kids, and make sure they grow up right.  it's the parents fault the kids grow up F##KED in the head
<LI>a good alternative for some people
<LI>I belive that it is generally good. For inhibited married couples it is a great learning experience!!
<LI>usefull
<LI>I love it!
<LI>too 'hot' a topic/rather irrelevant inn light of other societal ills/net access is limited and particularly restricted by socioeconomic factors/if it was a 'poor' people issue, it would not receive the attention
<LI>The sex on the net is not very important so let it be !!!!
<LI>It is there, big deal.  People put too much emphasis on the taboos of sexuality in the United States.  That taboo itself is more damaging than the material.  Regulation is a terrible idea.
<LI>Porn could be scrambled ,and be uns
<LI>I'm glad many of the resources are out there and while I don't generally get into NetPorn much I don't think it should be censored for mature adults
<LI>What the fuck could I say - let us see more ...
<LI>It is being used properly at present.
<LI>It is fine with me.  Parents need to take some responsibility and maybe teach their kids a few things.  Why should my rights be deleted because some parents are upset that their kids saw pornography on the net cause the parent did not regulate and watch their kids?  It is not nessasary the fact it is sex.  No the thing that bugs me is that the gov. is again, shrinking our rights.  What will ie be next, a manual on how to talk politicaly correct?  I hate censorship, no matter what the maturial is.  
<LI>I think parents should start acting like parents and start taking care of there kids. I'm not a kid any more and I resent the government telling me what I can view or read when I am of legal age to see sexually explicit material if I wish.
<LI>I'm glad it's there--which is different from saying it's everywhere.
<LI>good for when there's no one else around
<LI>you gotta love it man!
<LI>It should be left alone! If kids want it, they'll find it. Here, or on the smut magazine under their dads bed. Where's the difference? The net should be left open to all aspects!
<LI>It's kind of fun once in a while!
<LI>Sex is wonderful between a MAN and a WOMAN.  Enjoy it and shut up!
<LI>It allows for privacy in one's own home for people to get information about all aspects of sex and related topics concerning safe sex and diseases.  It is great for shy people who would never ask the questions or buy books to get the information they need.
<LI>It's not all it's cracked up to be. Some pictures and a lot 
<LI>It's there, and you can't really stop it.  I don't care for it, but you can't really do anything at all.
<LI>You have to search to find it.  There is too much hype about nothing.  Those yelling the loudest are probably those who don't even search for Sex on the internet
<LI>Some of it goes a little to far!
<LI>I believe that censorship of any kind is wrong.
<LI>Wish there was more. Government needs to keep out!!!
<LI>It's good, why not.
<LI>thank you...from me and my lover!
<LI>I think the goverment should just let it be.
<LI>Great thing!
<LI>Sex online is like most things in life as good or as bad as the people who use or abuse the system.
<LI>it's  O.K.
<LI>I believe that we are only begining to see a whole new set of laws coming into effect reguarding the internet and soon enough there will be laws about what oyu can post on you r pages about sex, drugs and other usually non public information, but how do we expect our kids to learn about these subjects if parents aren't willing to take time to exlain these topics.
<LI>ok
<LI>I want to experience what there is to offer but I can't access it I don't have any spacific addresses
<LI>It is the parents' responsibility - and theirs only - to raise their children and to instruct them about sex and the associated risks/resposibilites.  This is NOT, nor should it be, the role of Government!  The internet, at long last, provides the necessary catalyst to open the lines of communications between parents and their children about the subject of sex.  The loud, repressive, voices of the Radical Right does NOT represent the opinion of most Christians (we are Catholic) and indicates merely the
r own inadequacies when dealing with their own children on the subject of sex.
<LI>As is the case with almost everything in life, there are advantages and disadvantages to Sex on the Internet.  I see the Internet as a mega library.  All information (for and against specific social issues) should be available.  Explicit material not suitable for young eyes should be rated as such to inform parents of what this site contains and it is up to the parents to decide whether or not their child is old enough or mature enough to visit this site as is done at movie theatres.  We cannot stop, h
wever, those perverted parents from sexually abusing their children and using the Internet as a means to say "see, this is okay".  Only education (in school or otherwise) can stop these monsters from corrupting our youth, not the government, not censorship, not a "regulating body".
<LI>it is alright and it is exactly like TV was a long time ago with censorship it needs time thats all
<LI>Love it !
<LI>I don't think it be gov. regulated.
<LI>too much restrictions on sites in the US
<LI>child pornography in any form should not be on the net
<LI>People need to take responsibility for themselves and their progeny.We do NOT need more government interference in our lives.Where does censorship end? Ban sex and what's next, political ideas etc... If one's sensibilities are compromised by sex (or anything else for that matter) avoid it but one should not have the right to censor another.
<LI>Good for ADULTS but need to pay attention for the kids..
<LI>I think that Sex is a very wonderful thing and I enjoy it all the time.  I do not think that ANYONE should be disallowed the right to see or read what they would like over the Net.  However, I think that if you are under age (18 or younger) then you shoul
<LI>PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE. LIVE AND LET LIVE.
<LI>just a way to fell free
<LI>it is very realistic
<LI>I think it's an adults perogative whether he or she wants to interact sexually on the Net. What is not appropriate is for children to see graphic pornography on the Net.  If the new packages like Surfwatch, Net Nanny etc. can keep children away from sexually explicit sites than I don't think there's a problem with the existence of the material on the Net.  If these packages or others like them do not work, then unfortunately I believe that regulation is required.
<LI>It'll be here wether we or someone else tries to censor it.
<LI>Sex is good no matter where I get it.Except the anal
<LI>The government can't control crime. Or the speed limit! How do they expect to enforce arbitrary rules of morality?
<LI>Nobody is FORCED to use it!
<LI>no problem
<LI> If I can find it I like it
<LI>well...iwouldn't know because I really didn't found anything yet....
<LI>It's great.
<LI>It is too hard to find pictures of naked men!  Most of the pictures are of women.  I do not want censorship on the net.
<LI>The experience one gets out of the Internet depends a lot on the intellect which is attempting to use it.
<LI>more beastiality picts. HARDCORE!
<LI>Sex is great and the Internet too
<LI>I DON`T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT IT YET.
<LI>Just another form of communication and commerce.
<LI>Perhaps, the Internet allows interfacing of cultures and life styles which lead to understanding and tollerance!
<LI>It is very easy to find any kind of "sex" on the internet.  I personally do not agree with censorship, but do feel that someone (mainly guardians) should take some responsiblility in keeping children away from Sex on the Internet.
<LI>Some times pretty funny, some times too commercial, some times VERY stupid
<LI>good
<LI>excellent learning experinces
<LI>You should show the survey taker how they compare to others
<LI>Groovey
<LI>kewl
<LI>Good pass time that my wife and I enjoy
<LI>i think you should be able to see it if you want to
<LI>I'm fond of it.
<LI>it would be cool if someone on the net could blow me.
<LI>Not enough real stuff
<LI>it is a safe and confidential way to get info
<LI>Between consenting adults sex is fun and people shoud relate both socially and sexually
<LI>I think it is good, but the passwordes to places is bad.
<LI>Why the fuss? If a person wishes to view it let him. What harm does a little knowledge do?
<LI>its comes down to freedom of speach
<LI>Should NOT be restricted; Only exception -- the children stuff is OUT!
<LI>No answer
<LI>Well, from what I have seen over the past few years, I find that the Internet can be a great place to learn about sex.  Especially since many people on here, as well as easily obtained documented souces, can help ease talking about this subject.  As for pornography, it's far easier in real life to get it than it is on here, to be honest.
<LI>It rules.
<LI>Just because some parents are unable to keep their kids out of R movies "we" haven't closed them down.  Why should "we" limit access to sexual expliciate material just because parents can't supervisor their children. 
<LI>Right on Due!
<LI>I'll take it!
<LI>It sucks.
<LI>I can rent a video for a couple of bucks, and know what I'm getting.  The adventure of the net is cool, but the sexual satisfaction is crap.
<LI>should be excesible but controled for minors
<LI>I don't think it hould be banned.
<LI>Only just connected just laerning
<LI>I have not really looked for it but it seems to be abundant and caters for every level of perversion.
<LI>happy
<LI>Congress should not regulate internet.
<LI>Like any other type of material -- should be left up to the viewer to determine whether it is appropriate or inappropriate.
<LI>I think quite a lot of sex.  I also rather enjoy the Net (though not at all to the same degree).  As for putting the two together...   
<LI>It's safe and does bother anyone not looking for it
<LI>If humans can figure out a way to draw, carve, write, sculpt, or otherwise imply sex or sexual subjects in any medium, they will do so.  Any censoring is bound to be counterproductive and fruitless.  But, by the same token, humans have been seeking to censor sex and sexual subjects ever since those subjects were written, carved, sculpted, or implied.  This tit-for-tat cycle is a natural struggle that is destined to be repeated forever, with neither side gaining the advantage for very long.  Rather amus
ng, actually, and absolutely unstoppable.
<LI>a great way to explore the psychological aspects of sex
<LI>good idea but not in french
<LI>Good Stories, Something must be done about flaming and posting inmaterial stories.
<LI>hi ! MY NAME IS JIM G. I LIKE PORNOS, AND LITTLE CHILDREN  
<LI>i don't think that it should be regulated by the government. the government is given too much power over us already.
<LI>I think it is a benign pastime which cannot really hurt any adults.  After all we all have a choice of what we access.  I would consider it the ultimate "Safe Sex" the perfect "Zipless Fuck" as it were...
<LI>Great
<LI>it's ok
<LI>i think its fun and entertaining
<LI>Same as in the adult stores, or shops.  You gotta be 18 to enter.
<LI>ITS INTERSTING
<LI>wicked stuff!
<LI>Good, but should be less accessible to minors
<LI>I love it...
<LI>I feel that information on the Net should be freely exchanged.  The Users and parents of minors that use the Net should censor them from their end.  The 1st amendment MUST be defended!
<LI>I think they go together like bread and butter
<LI>I'm doing a senior thesis on the percieved need for ethical content regulation on the net.  Just passing through...
<LI>bad news!
<LI>The net just wouldnt be the same without it!!!
<LI>It really makes me feel good and horny. Feellike I could get up and fuck anything after a while.  Drives me crazy. Love it!!
<LI>Information should be available to those that want it...
<LI>good
<LI>I LIKE IT A LOT AND ITS ALL AROUND AND ON ME.
<LI>great
<LI>It's doesn't kill anybody.....
<LI>It is very new to me.  I think it is all an outlet for sexually deprived people. Or, those who access the internet for sexual gratification could be just a coward and afraid to approach a real person.
<LI>I find  it very stimulating and do not oppose it att all. I feel that sex on the net should be governed by each individual...if you don't want to b exposed to it stay away from it. I find the only way you end up seeing it is if you purposely look for it. In my opinion you can't accidently "bump" into it.
<LI>Senator Exon can go straight to hell.
<LI>I don't think that there is anything wrong with it.  After all I do belive it is called freedom of expresion
<LI>It is great!  I love the pictures of men and gay sex on "Men on the Net."
<LI>I think that the government should stay out of it.  I feel that if you don't want to see a "dirty picture" then don't look at it.
<LI>If I could find someone to talk with I would really enjoy it.
<LI>haven't seen enough to know
<LI>It is a poor substitute for the real thing.
<LI>Good clean fun !!!
<LI>JUST STARTING TO EXPLORE THIS
<LI>I AM JUST STARTING TO EXPLORE THIS 
<LI>I enjoy sex on the internet!
<LI>interesting
<LI>I think that anything between CONSENTING ADULTS is fine...i don't agree with any form of kiddie sex or anyone being forced to do something they do not want.
<LI>Educational; I see how I was dominated before I got divorced
<LI>sure why not!!!!!
<LI>WWW not much for sexual content, but you can dig up a lot in IRC if you try
<LI>I have enjoyed exploring erotica on the internet,  It is very interesting to find the great variety  of things that turn people on.  My fantasies are very prosaic
<LI>more, more, more
<LI>At my age it's no big big concern
<LI>love it
<LI>love it
<LI>Hard to find the right information
<LI>I like it!!!  Too bad I'm not smart enough to decode binaries.
<LI>It's great
<LI>One can encounter many aspects of life on the Net, sex is just another aspect of life.  I beleave that to attempt to take sex of the Net is similair to attempting to take it out of mags and other publishings.  You don't find it unless your looking for it so it's hard for me to understand how someone can be offended by it's existance on the Net--how did they encounter it?
<LI>threshhold first ammendment issue
<LI>I think parints/guardians should preview what a minor wants to see but adults should not be restricted.
<LI>It is really fun since it is difficult, if not impossible, to get this type of material in my home town!
<LI>real sex is better!
<LI>its great!!!!!
<LI>Easy to find.  Some of it's good, some bad, like with all media.
<LI>just started 
<LI>it uses a lot of bandwidth, but I enjoy it
<LI>It`s good, nurds can watch naked vomens
<LI>It all must be free and think by users themselves.
<LI>SHOULD BE LEFT TO EACH INDIVIDUALS LIKING
<LI>I don't have a problem with it as long as it's for adults only
<LI>the porn on the net really sucks. buying porn from a conveince store is much easier
<LI>Hands Off!!!  Use software to prevent access, if needed.
<LI>Almost every time I am on the internet,my pussy is wet!!!!
<LI>It's like going to a bar you can get it if you want to, and if you're under 18 - stay the fuck out!!!!!
<LI>I think it's great to have sexual content on-line
<LI>It is a voyueristic outlet and inlet and very time consuming and addictive (to Me)
<LI>wonderful
<LI>Sexual material on the internet is just that. It isn't real and shouldn't be regarded as such... If there is to be ANY regulation of the internet, it should start at home.
<LI>It is good
<LI>i would would like to see more than adds!
<LI>safe,should be able to block if needed by parents
<LI>It seems like it all about making money. Nothing is for fun.
<LI>good
<LI>i want more of it
<LI>Non-harmful if viewed with an open mind
<LI>This a good idea.  Thanks
<LI>More free pictures
<LI>EDUCATIONAL
<LI>The openess of the net has greatly improved my sexlife with my wife and helped open our relationship up in other ways as well
<LI>safe,good,pleasurable
<LI>It's a wonderful way to learn and experiment with new sexual experiences.  It should be for adults only, but NOT restricted from adults in ANY WAY!!!!
<LI>Sex is the primary human activity, the net is the new frontier.
<LI>I like it and I wish the government would but out.
<LI>I've had at least 15 blind dates with people from the internet.  I've had some *very* interesting encounters, erotic and romantic.  It's been fun.
<LI>It seems that the NET was one of the few places where information was truly free... It was wonderful. I'm angry and frustrated with attempts to censor. 
<LI>they both rule!
<LI>leave it alone the government should not have the power to 
<LI>it's the best thing that happein
<LI>I said that, sex in the net is ok. How about you, masturbator?
<LI>i think it is great. parents should be able to controle their own kids. i dont see how the american government can try to controle something that is WORLD WIDE if parrents dont know enough about the net then dont let your kids on the computer...and thats my oppinion
<LI>Great!
<LI>It is educational and exciting!
<LI>Boring
<LI>I think it's a great way for people to find out what they always wanted to know about sex!
<LI>I really want to do it 
<LI>I think it is a good Idea.
<LI>wish i could see more that my server denies
<LI>its ok
<LI>Adulte should be able to access any materials that they want to on the net.  Parents should be responsible for what their children have access to.
<LI>As any other subjects I think there should be a place for "Sex" on the Internet as well. People that want it should be able to find it. Children should be under their parents jurisdiction. Otherwise there are a lot more damaging effects from other aspects of human life, compared with Sex. After all Sex promotes life. Wars and other conflicts tend to extinguish it. The survey for all it's worth seems excellent. Congratulations !!
<LI>NOT TO EXPLICIT, JUST PICTURES, YOU CAN ONLY FIND IT IF YOU LOOK FOR IT.
<LI>i think that companies need to give parents the resources to censore or block off what the do not want there childeren to see.
<LI>A damn fine idea - just avoid dicks misleading others
<LI>IT IS SO EASY TO SEE PORNOGRAPHY
<LI>Too much filth and weird sex
<LI>No Answer
<LI>Benign source of pleasure but kids should be prevented from access.
<LI>Sex is out there.  I think that it should be openly talked about and I think that legal guardians should be in charge of what gets seen, not the government
<LI>I love it.
<LI>I THINK IT IS GREAT
<LI>I love sex, and I love the Internet.  The Internet should *not* be censored.  It is up to parents to monitor their own children. I don't need the government or anyone else to make my choices for me.  How *dare* they think they know what is ok for me to see!  What makes would-be censors think there judgement is any better than mine?  Those would would attempt to censor the Internet are busybodies who should mind their own business.  I razed two moral, intellegent children without busybodies moralizing. 
As adults they have the right to raise their own children without government or other busybodies telling them what they can see!
<LI>I haven't really looked that hard but I am grateful there is somewhere to get advice and information.
<LI>sex - the best thingyou can do
<LI>just do it
<LI>just do it
<LI>I want MORE....I want YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>it's addictive
<LI>I THINK IT IS A NEAT THING TO BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT OTHERS ARE DOING AND THINKING ABOUT SEX.  WE CAN NEVER LET ANYONE STAND IN OUR WAY OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND PRESS.
<LI>interesting questions. well developed in form and content.
<LI>MAKE IT DIRTIER
<LI>I think sex is less dangerous than war, rape, hard crime etc. that is flooding the news and the net!!!
<LI>devine
<LI>Iiiiii Like It !!!!!
<LI>it's a good thing with it
<LI>GREAT
<LI>Nice place to visit, wouldn't want to live there!
<LI>I want to experience beastiality
<LI>Am just starting to become involved
<LI>I find that it has helped me discover other sexualities out there, and whether one can approve or disaprove of sex on the net, we all are apart of sexually driven society and its apart of everyone's lifestyle at almost any age "these days"
<LI>Parents should monitor their children's actions on the net.
<LI>It's saved me a lot of money on pornography.
<LI>I LOVE SEX!!!!  THE INTERNET RULES!!!!
<LI>i think it's the newest form of safe sex
<LI>Don't approve, but sexual, non-tittilating, conversation should be fine.
<LI>No special opinion to date
<LI>I like sex on the net, because I can see what I am never going to have up close and personal!!!
<LI>Sex on the Internet is fun for adults.  A great fantasy outlet.
<LI>Lets see some more!!!!!!!!
<LI>I don't know much.  I feel kids should be able to see a limited amount of exual information.
<LI>I think it is an excellent way for people to be honest with sexuality without having someone right there to judge them.
<LI>wonderfull
<LI>no big deal.
<LI>The Internet is merely a reflection of the wants of its users.
<LI>ENTERTAINING
<LI>not for me
<LI>Its a potential homewrecker...that's for sure!
<LI>the internet doesn't affect much in the sex department, It's just like buying a magazene.
<LI>It's fun, can't catch anything, get horny and go to the bedroom
<LI>Sex on the internet is cool for those who want to see it.  I believe that parents should show tighter control over the homeplace and censor pornography instead of waiting for someone else to take the responsibility!!!
<LI>I love sex and the Internet
<LI>sex on the net is great.  it has really done a lot for me.
<LI>you don't have more sex than any other institution
<LI>I like it very much!!!!!!!!
<LI>Too far and few between good sites ...
<LI>Its there and I'm not surprised
<LI>its cool
<LI>There is a few real pornography in internet, it is a pity
<LI>It can be healthy but, also harmful in some situations.
<LI>While it is very important for there to be the free exchange of ideas and information, efforts should be made to self-regulate (in the very least) the net, or a government will do so.
<LI>I want hardest sex in internet
<LI>very good!
<LI>it is great and very personal and cheap....no one know you are doing it!!
<LI>I think Sex is something that should be kept behind closed doors. NOT ON THE INTERNET!
<LI>it's pretty cool
<LI>Sex is what you make it...
<LI>I think it's great, just another form of people sharing ideas and stuff...If people like it why stop just because some people don't?
<LI>they are both part of daily living 
<LI>it can be an enhancement.....the problem is those who seek replacement of off line life.....
<LI>just do it!
<LI>Sex on the internet has become an issue which is completely blown out of proportion.
<LI>just do it!
<LI>I find it quite fulfilling.  It allows me to enjoy reading about a wide spectrum of sexual topics in the privacy of my home.
<LI>I think sex is a good idea. I think my idea of sex is a good idea for me. I don't think I have any right to tell anyone what to do, or how to do it. And, I think that, like what a child eats, what a child has access to on the net is up to the parents. It is not up to Internet to be a free babysitter.
<LI>If the Internet is going to be completely open, whatever one wants to supply should be able to be found on the Internet.
<LI>Very poor quality.  Easier to go to video store.
<LI>No Comment
<LI>The obligation of online providers is to develop a system whereby parents are "able" to selectively censor the net, without restricting other users.  AOL has made the first attempt at this, and I like it.
<LI>it's ruining my marriage
<LI>I love it
<LI>Sex is "GREAT !" and internet is like a drug
<LI>Using chat, it allows me to frankly ask other people about some of my fantasies, and to see if they have expeienced it.  If they have I can find out what is was like for them.
<LI>YES
<LI>interesting
<LI>Safe sex on the NET
<LI>Sex is fnatasy
<LI>I think that when i am on the internet I could be missing out on sex in the next room...
<LI>it is sick
<LI>i think that it should be available to those who are of legal age and wish to view it
<LI>I believe it is another forum to degrade the sanctity of something a lot more special than the NET.
<LI>Its frustrating to have to wait while it comes up
<LI>It should be accessed by all who want to see it.
<LI>It's good!!!
<LI>haven't seen any, but not because I haven't tried
<LI>I love sex & the internet is a get away like tv... just a little more interactive. 
<LI>GOOD INFORMATION RESOURCE
<LI>Some good information.
<LI>I would like to get information for contacts
<LI> I feel sex on the internet has done nothing and will do nothing to make a child or younger person have sex.  People have sex because they want to, not because a computer program told them to.  I feel sex is a great way to relieve stress and a great form of entertainment.  I wouldn't stop reading about it or doing it--even if I had to.
<LI>I think its great, but there needs to be more hardcore stuff
<LI>It's OK -  Fun!
<LI>I like it, it is a goood and safe way to read and see this material
<LI>I find that downloading a few erotic images makes a satisfying short break from work.
<LI>I think its Great
<LI>I think if parents think it's O.K., than we have no buisness making a law saying they can't.
<LI>its cool
<LI>well it does nothing for me
<LI>It's fine, and it's the parent's responsability to monitor their children. The net is a rescource and a tool for educating and informing ourselves. I've learned more over the net than I've learned from my parents or teachers. The only place I could say I learned more about sex than the net is with my partner.
<LI>Freedom of pictures, sex is great, censorship is ludicrous
<LI>no answer
<LI>I think it's ok just not for children.
<LI>I believe it is destroying marriages and encourages deception
<LI>I think it's fine that it's there, and I use it at times.  I do not think it should be regulated.  If parents don't want the children to see it, keep an eye on them.  If adults are offended by it, then tough shit. Deal with it.  No one is shoving it in their faces.
<LI>The net allows for communication of ideas at a rapid pace, some of these are sexual. It acts as an outlet for several types of pesonalities that are discouaraged in traditional cultures, if this prevents rape, incest and the like then it is good if not th
<LI>I think it's fine that it's there, and I use it at times.  I do not think it should be regulated.  If parents don't want the children to see it, keep an eye on them.  If adults are offended by it, then tough, deal with it.  No one is shoving it in their faces.
<LI>I don't see a great problem w it. 
<LI>I really use the Internet a lot, but I am not interested in Sex on the Net. I still prefer - and hopefully always will- the real thing.
<LI>GRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAATTTT!!!!!!!!
<LI>It's great!!!
<LI>i think it is great bcause it allows to explore different types of sexuality and ways to make your relationship better. anyone that is againsy sex on the net well fuck you and your mother.
<LI>Its inevidable. Attempting to stop it only strangles the rest of the net.
<LI>Entertaining, benign
<LI>I THINK ITS GREAT AND NOW I WANT TO HAVE MORE SEX WITH ANYONE 
<LI>could be better
<LI>Http://www.sec
<LI>Internet is the most useful and universal telecommunications tool our civilization has ever seen.  Also, sex is a natural part of our existence.  I feel Internet plays a splendid role in disrupting cultural taboos, as well as serving other vital communications functions.
<LI>It's mixed, good and bad
<LI>It's great!  Both of them...
<LI>A good idea
<LI>I think taht sex on the internet must be open for everyone. Ofcourse children must not seem real hardcore sex, but I don't want to be punished because some parents can't handle their children. I am old enough to speak for myself!!
<LI>Love it
<LI>i think its very informative, and a place to find a kindred spirt who shares the same tates in sex with out cencership
<LI>Sex is a part of our basic nature. But it is hidden and made perverse my old religious ideals. The internet has allowed our species to explore all aspects of sexuality and I believe will allow the impressionable to make a choice about sex. 
<LI>no opinion
<LI>if it is consenting adults viewing then i have no ptoblem with it
<LI>it is okay for me
<LI>unsure at this time.  
<LI>Im 22 years old and i think i can make my own choice.
<LI>Its a fun way for concenting adults to have safe sex
<LI>sex is great. its my life. the net is ok for gifs and such..
<LI>SEX ON THE INTERNET SUCKS
<LI>It is entertaining and quite erotic.  Good old fashion fun!!
<LI>Fun and lushess
<LI>it압 good
<LI>People need to concern themselves with real problems and not the symptoms.
<LI>What's wrong with sex?  Your mother had it didn't she?
<LI>Needs to be made more accessible!
<LI>I enjoy it's presence
<LI>it's hard to find free good sex pictures
<LI>9-14 yearold boys
<LI>for the people who put beautiful pictures of the huamn body i praise your art!  To those who pollute the 'net with your garbage pictures your perverted shits!!!!
<LI>sex is awesome and so is the internet. they go hand in hand.
<LI>I think the Internet provides an excellent outlet for sexual expression of all kinds.
<LI>they go hand in hand for some and thats fine, but i dont really get off on computer picts.
<LI>I think that sex on the internet is very abundent on the internet . And sometimes it does get rather annoying with every search item you select theree is something about sex brought up
<LI>could show more of my fetishes(up the skirt) Needs parental approval more for kids(over 16 and no access to anyone under 16)
<LI>I'm 20, and I think that most sites that limit access to 21 and older are violating my rights to "ADULT ENTERTAINMENT."
<LI>it is ok
<LI>It's nice to see there are others who share similar interests
<LI>I like it!
<LI>OK, freedom of speech, and freedom of press reign here.
<LI>It is good.  
<LI>I would like to tryt it.
<LI>OK over 18 years - old enough to die for our country!
<LI>its not bad...it promots safe sex
<LI>HI!!  Brent Young if you would like to chat call 1-405-373-4639 or write 924 Polk  Piedmont,OK.  I'd like to hear from anyone!!!
<LI>I THINK THAT PARENTS NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT THEIR CHILDREN SEE AND HAVE ACCESS TO.
<LI>Mostly lame and capitalistic, yet sometimes, hot
<LI>Sex is great, the internet is equally as great, put them together and it is iressistible.
<LI>Rock on!
<LI>another form of venting sexual frustration for adults
<LI>It's never too late to open your mind--adventure.
<LI>only one way of finding sexual material, but private
<LI>I find it is a great place to talk about taboo subjects.  IT's real educational.
<LI>The only thing unnatural about sex is the desire to hide it from society.
<LI>Verry Different
<LI>It's part of life and is therefore part of the Internet
<LI>I Love It!!!!! can't get enuff
<LI>Geared toward a teenage male geek mentality.  Real men don't need cybersex! 
<LI>Not Having any children, I feel I cannot judge sex on the net as negative.  I believe it seems to be all-male oriented sites which discourages me.  Don't we have enough material that glorifies a woman's body?  I would like to see some virile, young men!! 
<LI>I think it allwows some true informatin to be aired.
<LI>i think that it is here and that it isn't going anywhere.  parents need to control what their children are viewing/reading and that it the govt has no right to control what is avaliable.
<LI>LIKE TO SEE MORE OPEN
<LI>Pathetic.  Serious information/discussion is almost impossible to find compared to commercial pornography.
<LI>I'm new to the internet, but from what i see, i like.
<LI>Party on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>It is appealing but should probably be restricted.
<LI>I'm just discovering the internet and sex and can't wait to see where it leads.
<LI>I am a new user of the internet and am still just checking it out.
<LI>More realtime sites (chatting, videos etc)
<LI>I hear about kiddie porn being a problem but have yet to see any
<LI>I think it's great!!!
<LI>its great just have all net software thats new have a parental lock and have updates to upgrade old software. The net should be able to provide all leagal sex materials to people 21 and over freely
<LI>its whatever you want it to be.
<LI>I Like Sex
<LI>Works for me..... Other than that, I have Zero to say...
<LI>for any one of legal age..it's a fine thing
<LI>I think its great.  
<LI>more is better
<LI>It is not all to bad.  It really helps some people to explore there feeling with out being ashamed of it.  I guess that I am a Zoophile and now I am comfortable with the feeling.
<LI>It is clean fun.
<LI>it is no different than sex on TV (HBO, playboy channel, etc...)- let parents apply restrictions as the parent deems necessary. 
<LI>It is a basic catalogue for whatever you would like to see, purchase, or use. Beyond that it is up to the individual to find sexual interests. thanks
<LI>I think the government should worry more about themselves
<LI>i think it will be great
<LI>Not at all exciting.  I've not seen any graphics.
<LI>giving a child unsupervised net access is just as bad as giving them cigarettes and beer
<LI>it's pretty cool
<LI>sex on the internet should be open and regulated in the household
<LI>OK
<LI>It's great.
<LI>whats better than sex???the internet is a good outlet and a possible meeting place for people with the same ideas.
<LI>more free stuff!  It does have the potential to aid the community [cyberporn/sex] and hopefully this will be developed.
<LI>it's a curiosity thing
<LI>Sex, porno(all forms) and other fantasy material should not be censored. We all have a right to see, read and admit info that we like. no one should stop this!
<LI>on the net Iam able to explore areas of interest from the privacy of my home
<LI>too much time to find too little viewing
<LI>very interesting and informative
<LI>need more lesbian sites, too many dorky male sites.  
<LI>I enjoy it very much.  It's fascinating and entertaining.
<LI>it very hot, you can see a lot of thing
<LI>I am frustrated by not being able to find what I want - child pornography
<LI>Great educational/entertainment resource. Terrific for meeting new friends and potential partners.
<LI>it's ok... A rating system and electronic screening should be available with parental control
<LI>Fuck it
<LI>need more nude pictures to download 
<LI>Finding sex on the Internet is no more (and no less!) difficult than finding it a 7-11.  If you are looking for an adult magazine, the plastic wrap doesn't hide the fact that the material is available.  Just like attempting to censor the net will only result in a false "facade" offering little real security from sex, but perhaps a little emotional security for the prudish.   This box needs to be bigger so I can read all of my text at the same time!
<LI>Keep it on
<LI>Big whoop....who cares.  Nothing beats the real thing.
<LI>I like the pictures of naked and half-naked men.
<LI>It's okay!  We all have "certain inailiable rights" (1st ammendment) of the Constitution
<LI>ok
<LI>Lots of fun, a real eye opener!
<LI>it satisfies curiosity when u can find it
<LI>it's great. the more open, the better.
<LI>I think that there should be sex on the internet
<LI>I think that there is nothing wrong with it-- it can help people fulfill some of their fantasies to an extent, without risking contact with things like STD's...
<LI>I think it's great. This society (America) is too damn repressed for it's own good. The people complaining probably fantasize about worse than you can find on the net!          
<LI>Self Regulation and Guidelines Should prevail
<LI>It's a part of our life
<LI>I want some pictures of it.
<LI>Happy that it exists.
<LI>There is a place on the internet for anything. 
<LI>Make it "Hotter"!
<LI>I think that it is the best 
<LI>ALL KIND OF PROSTITUTION HAVE TO BE AVOIDED
<LI>I think it is a produkt of the society`s technological development and must be accepted. The future may come to show that this was just the beginning of "the era of free accsess to sexual fantasies for Everyone" tasiessess
<LI>It's fun!
<LI>I wonder why the government has taken it upon themselves to decide who is old, or mature enough to view sexual material.. I'm 15, but a lot more mature than some adults! Why is someone that's 21 more suited to see sexual material than a 15 or 16 year old?
<LI>easily acessed. largely perverse. needs more security. Currently kids can get in easily if they want to.
<LI>it can be better
<LI>not very exciting
<LI>Myself I enyoy it, but I am over 21 and I am very opened minded about sex. I am not ashamed of what I like to view.
<LI>i think its fine if you dont like it dont look
<LI>It's great and it definitely helped my marriage!
<LI>i wish there were more on line sex chat lines if any are out there
<LI>havent seen mutch yet
<LI>Personally, I believe that it is an uncontrollable source of immorality for adults and children alike.  It would be better if all- yes, all sexual content (meaning pornography) be kept behind coded "screens".  I find no problem with sex education, ect. but I strongly oppose pornography on the internet.
<LI>I'd love to find ways on the net to meet people in my area that enjoy sexual encounters, orgies, etc.
<LI>HARMLESS TO ADULTS, HARMFULL TO CONFUSED LONLEY KIDS
<LI>it is a new and very exciting area that I have found really fun and exciting and fun> no really I think it is harmless and I have enjoyed the freedom it allows people to explore bizarre fantaies with out anyoner getting hut.
<LI>I feel that it could help people meet potential partners.
<LI>Not an issue with me, but I believe that the net should stay uncontrolled. let the parents take an interest in their children. The net is not a baby sitter. 
<LI>I have no problem with it. If you want sex on the net...you should be able to get it.
<LI>it's easily accessed, but it should be like everything else.  Internet providers should have some sort of censorship tool for parents to use, but that wouldn't affect the rest of us mature, responsible adults.
<LI>it압 good becurse you learn a lot of it.
<LI>Fine with me, you do only what you really want to do with it. 
<LI>it's great fun
<LI>I'd like to explore more of it.
<LI>It's a free world, and people went to war to give us this freedom,so lets keep it.
<LI>lots of fun!
<LI>It's all a bit sad really
<LI>porno is as porno is
<LI>education not supression is a healthier attitude to sex
<LI>It's a good idea
<LI>OK
<LI>I think it is fine, but I have found forums where it is not appropriate - like on searches.  BUT - I do NOT want govmt to be involved, I think that we are responsible parents, too, so I encourage the children to sue the internet for school, but I usually help them.  I also feel that supervision is important, but your kids should know their boundaries anyway.  Besides, The hype about all of the porn on the Internet - in my day it was a big deal to look at Playboy and the like.  I remember boys talking a
out it - so - I guess we just need to teach our children what is appropriate and what isn't.  Besides - eventually they will see things - they are always curious.  As long as it is a look see type of thing - I don't agree with online sex chat- that takes it to a new level.  Although I don't feel that that should be regulated either!!!
<LI>it's really to access but really ininteresting
<LI>at my age to have a hard-on is a precious sign of vitality-and internet help
<LI>I Love It and Get Hard thinking about and horny when I see it.
<LI>In one word----FREEDOM.  The internet is owned by no one, so why is it nessecary to regulate it beyond recognition.  I'm of the opinion that if you don't want to see sex, don't look for it.  By chance if you bump into it, turn away or turn it off.  Be aware of what your children have access to and deal with it accordingly. 
<LI>it is very interesting and very easy to come across
<LI>i want to see more
<LI>Sex is very great.
<LI>I think what some people are calling porn is no more than a Fredricks of Hollywood ad. I have yet to see mush hard core porn on the Internet. Live chat rooms on AOL and other services are worse than the Internet search can find!
<LI>IT SHOULD BE GIVEN A CHANCE TO EVOLVE. PUBLIC WILL FORCE SELF-REGULATION.
<LI>There should be more.  There should be one home page for all subjects.
<LI>The internet does different things for different people... all depending on what that particular person wants from it.
<LI>I think its a great masturbating tool. some people are embarrassed to buy books etc. so with the net you can get anything anytime and jerk off 24 hours a day if you want.
<LI>it is important to allow freedom and permit people to express themselves as long as they are not hurting anybody. it is also a nice diversion. moral majority sucks but perverts too
<LI>It's the best thing that ever happned to sex!
<LI>I think the the Net should be no different than your average newsstand.  If you are too young, you should not be allowed to see sex stuff.  Anyone over 18 should have ABSOLUTELY no restrictions placed on them.  Give me Liberty or give me a 286.
<LI>I LOVE
<LI>I think it's fine for adults.
<LI>If you need it,you can get it. I am glad its there.
<LI>I do not engage in cybersex, but am interested in reading what people say in cybersex. What value they get out of it, is beyond me!  It does nothing for me!
<LI>interesting
<LI>I THINK IT'S GREAT!  IF MY WIFE DOESN'T WANT SEX I CAN JUST LOGON AND HAVE SAFE SEX WITHOUT CHEATING.  I ALSO LIKE SEEING THINGS I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN, BUT TOO SCARED OR JUST HAVEN'T TRIED YET.  I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN TV'S, BUT REALLY SCARED.
<LI>Sex is a beautiful thing and I see no problem with it being on the net
<LI>cut off the access to minors using the internet providers.
<LI>I don't think society is enhanced by it.  In fact I think society is damaged by it
<LI>it should be open to whom ever wants as long as their of age
<LI>Indifferent for the most part.
<LI>Cost too much!
<LI>where is it?
<LI>I want to see CD & VIdeo.Because I join from Japan.
<LI>I think it is hyped up too much. A lot of what is easily available is tame. There are too many companies seeking payment for access to sex related sites.
<LI>Good. Keep it up.
<LI>Eliminate all child porn & its disseminators from the net; children can easily be exploited and they should be protected. I work for a US gov't contract and have access to the gov't server: On this gov't server you can see ALL the sex images of women you 
<LI>poor
<LI>I think the sex in the internet is good.
<LI>I like it....it's a good way to masturbate!!!It's a real turn on.
<LI>great
<LI>Internet is probbly the biggest source of SEX
<LI>I love it!!  Haven't figured out SeeUSeeme yet though.
<LI>I think that it is one of the things that is driving the interest in the internet. Sensor the net and watch people find other avenues.
<LI>would like more area on incest
<LI>over rated & over hyped.
<LI>cool stuff for people looking for safe sex.....! 
<LI>Good
<LI>I think the Internet has to have all kind of stuff, (including sex)...
<LI>interesting
<LI>overrated or over 'reported' by hysterical Christians
<LI>It's nice, I like it.
<LI>exciting and I really enjoy it
<LI>i have no problems with sex on the internet, besides when children are involved, i think there must be no regulation to any subject. Let people listen, see and speak about there interest nomather what they are. Freedom and liberty for all.
<LI>I think that the internet is a refletion of today's society so sex on the net should be allowed. As for the "problem" of children being exposed to it through the net, it's up to the parents to instill good values. And besides, has anyone watched prime time tv lately ?!
<LI>Cybersex is great!
<LI>Ido not believe in censorship of any type.
<LI>a nescessary poll that ALL citizens need to answer truthfully if society is to understand the potential of the 'net
<LI>thank you for the opp'y to suggest the freedom is better than any censorship.
<LI>It's very different.  I'm a wirehead, so I love it.
<LI>hmmm
<LI>I have no problem with it.
<LI>I think that if parents responsibly montior their childrens' activities on the Net, instead of using it as a baby sitter, then the question of exposure becomes moot.
<LI>it is very stimulating and informative
<LI>Very Cool
<LI>Love it!
<LI>I see nothing wrong with cybersex. It seems totally harmless.
<LI>Regulations if and what they are going to be, they need to be enacted now so that service providers and others can act accordingly and sex can take the whatever place it is going to take on the internet and sites can become stable and accessible to those looking for them.
<LI>I think it's silliness.  It does nothing for anyone w/a brain.
<LI>Good
<LI>there should be less jpeg files or you should offer jpeg as a download
<LI>kool bananas
<LI>It's the best i've had in Years!
<LI>alot of potential, good as long as it is monitored by each individual as to what they are looking for. this should be a self regulated subject
<LI>Hard to find online action
<LI>It is fun and cost effective
<LI>no comment
<LI>It's all new to me. It's exciting.
<LI>i think its great, my wife and I have a lot of fun trying to find stuff on sex.
<LI>Insubstantial need relationship....
<LI>for me it may be ok
<LI>I LIKE IT
<LI>i like it
<LI>Sex is the best as for the internet I have not really explored it yet.
<LI>Highly overrated, no problem at all for responsible parents
<LI>cybersex is and always will be safe sex. anybody who worries about abstractions and not reality is clearly having problems themselves
<LI>Where there's a medium like I-net there's people exploring sex. There are sights being shut down because of all the visitors so there is a need for it. I men/women can find sex/partners overhere then they don't have to go out on the street to make that an unsafe area.
<LI>I just wish you could find pictures of men eating after-birth or some woman being fist-fucked up her ass.So far all I can find is pussy shit like fags and dikes sucking donkey dicks.
<LI>Sex is a part of life, however teaching children is what parents are for (or at least I thought so...). Better ask Uncle Bill.
<LI>interesting but only as a time filler not a replacement
<LI>No Comment
<LI>it is simpley great !!! keep on doing it !!!
<LI>i HAVE HAD A BLAST I MEET 2 LADIES ONLINE AND HAD GREAT SEX, 
<LI>The net is real life, and sex is a part of it, It's everywhere and I don't think that it matters. Especially in the USA the duiscussions are going on and on on this subject, but who has the guts to ban guns first...... 
<LI>Its great
<LI>Surprisingly commercialized my many, generally acceptable to few
<LI>I wish it was easier to talk about sex on the net. On line systems like AOL have excellent areas for pervertion!
<LI>good
<LI>It is a good place to get questions answered. 
<LI>I like it, Much better than having Tapes around the house.
<LI>It appears to be a business more than anything else
<LI>Right on!
<LI>it's great, it's the best thing to happen to me since my first sexual experience with my next door neighbour!
<LI>I think it could be sick sometimes,  but i doesn't bother me
<LI>It Rules
<LI>I think the government should stay out of this issue (and quite a few others). The marketplace will take care of itself.
<LI>It's great, I LOVE IT!  KEEP IT UP! :) <BG>
<LI>Pretty cool
<LI>very cool
<LI>it is good
<LI>There isn't anything wrong with sex and the internet provided that children can't access it easily. On the otherhand, there should be some kind of regulation that would protect young children from accessing sexually explicit materials and charge and put those adults into prisons for presenting these materials to children.
<LI>Dislike the `commercial' teasers!
<LI>I would like to see more sex photos on the net.
<LI>NO PROBLEM
<LI>More please
<LI>it doesn't matter what anyone thinks ,you can't force your own opion or morals on others ,even god give us a choice ( we have or own conscious and we are responsible for our choices) 
<LI>I think it's interesting and stimulating
<LI>interesting
<LI>the sex in the net is very good!!!
<LI>Mostly poorly done, with little content.
<LI>Pornography should be available for those who are of legal age and request it.
<LI>The experiences of sex that I have had were enjoyable and non-damaging
<LI>Its a whole new dimension to sexuality...
<LI>Unlike what ignorant people and media think, the Net doesn't revolve around sex.  Sex is only a small content of the Net.
<LI>I think it's the best thing that has happened to this country.
<LI>can not seem to find anything more than very soft porn and that is hard for me (a step above newbie) to find.
<LI>I think it's great that there's yet one more way that people can expand the range of the human sexual experience. I also think that matching on the net holds promise for the future as a way of bypassing all the bar and club BS. Perhaps if more children have unbridled access to sexual material on the net, there won't be so many ignorant teens out there getting themselves into unwanted pregnancy and STD situations. And perhaps more kids will be satisfied with masturbating to porn instead of losing their 
irginity so early and suffering other consequences of early sexuality.
<LI>It needs faster technology, more bandwidth, teleconferencing
<LI>I doesn't matter.
<LI>IF YOU LOOK FOR IT YOU WILL FIND IT!
<LI>I don't see a problem with it if children are monitored by thier parents. ( Who should be doing this anyway!)
<LI>always internet is an oportunity
<LI>it has not much value besides being a turn-on. There is little real information (at least as far as I know).
<LI>It is somewhat interesting to see what others think about sex.
<LI>Great - we should have more of it !
<LI>could be more
<LI>i want more free access
<LI>Sex is great and so is the Internet. Governments butt out!!. b\\\\elong 
<LI>Benign.  Give it it's place where one has to go specifically to find it, and let the rest of us, or at least spend the rest of ur time, getting on with our business.
<LI>Like most new forms of media, Sex was predominate at first then settled into its own natural level of censorship. The net will do the same.
<LI>i like it
<LI>tom
<LI>I WISH IT WAS NOT CENSORED OR DOSENT COST ANYTHING
<LI>it allows me to get satisfied safely
<LI>An appropriate freedom of speech where one must be allowed to pursue their interests free of government intervention.
<LI>Enjoy it a bit too much.
<LI>pretty wierd
<LI>The net is pure democratic anarchy. We all do as we choose. We all have a say. If you choose to look at porn, that's your choice. If you choose NOT to look at porn then avoid it like the plague. Regardless of where you are, cyberspace or "real life," ever
<LI>It does have it's place in the world. It's not going anywhere soon.
<LI>Sex on the Internet is a positive way to expand our culture.  Americans fetish of sex will increse with technology.
<LI>Im interesting
<LI>This is the first time, i dont know what i exactly think
<LI>interesting...very interesting
<LI>It great!
<LI>Satisfies sexual frustration to some point
<LI>It's fucking awesome!
<LI>There should be some kind of age verification, password, etc. I would like to see it easier to find for adults
<LI>Sex and the Internet are reality...So are books, movies, vcr's and I don't agree with censorship on any of those
<LI>Sex? I love it! The intermet? Love it!!!
<LI>I love sex and I like Internet
<LI>It`s relaxing!
<LI>In proper moderation and under moral, adult supervision, it is another form of experssion and entertainment that is private and harmless and maybe even informative
<LI>I love it but it can be addicting. I do not favor it at the expense of other uses of the internet.
<LI>Sex is great and the Internet helps us frustrated housewives.
<LI>good
<LI>Anything that makes it easier to get laid is COOL.
<LI>I find the stories are interesting, helps the sex life with my boyfriend in that I have a story in my head from the net.  Sex on the net is great because so many people are closed minded and some just have no idea about sex, I believe the net opens up a new spectrum of possiblities.
<LI>loveley
<LI>let we choose our own stuff. 
<LI>I'm 14 and found this with ease
<LI>it rules
<LI>Love It
<LI>great
<LI>should be possible
<LI>doesnt matter
<LI>children are not getting sex education in either home or schooschoo 
<LI>I think that while children should not have access to sexually explicit material, once a government or other body begins to limit what one can/can not have access to, many conservatives will try and limit what other groups have access to.  It will inevitably lead to a slippery slope.  Internet users should not tolerate such types of limitations.
<LI>I have found it invaluable for contact with other like minded people - all over the world makes it especially interesting
<LI>not poro
<LI>I love sex & the internet.
<LI>I like masturbating while I surf the net
<LI>It's fine as long as it's viewed by mature people.  Parents should regulate their children, not the government!
<LI>personally, I've only found a really lame SM manual.  That's it.  Of course I found that only after searching for material on cattle branding!!!  I don't look for it, and I haven't "stumbled" upon anything sexual.  I'm sure it's there if I wanted to find it.

<LI>The net has access to information on sexuality to pornographic pictures. Whatever infor mation you need to know about sex you can find it on the INTERNET.
<LI>Internet should educate us about our sex options.

<HR NOSHADE>

<H2><CENTER><I>How would you deal with the issue of regulating sexual/offensive content?</I></CENTER></H2>
<H4>
<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_SOL -->
<LI>Parental responsibility.  Everyone else should deal with it.
<LI>Let parents control their children
<LI>Electronic security software
<LI>Leave it be. It is a parents job to censor.
<LI>parents should decide it
<LI>self control / parental supervision
<LI>Close site access until users age is proven. (i.e. I'm not exactly sure how though, maybe when video phones become a reality then users could identify themselves in person?)
<LI>should be less accessable to children
<LI>Parents controll access
<LI>parental supervision
<LI>LET PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY WANT AS LONG AS IT IS LEGAL!!!
<LI>using passwords that have been applied for through mail
<LI>Same rules on the Net as in real life
<LI>parental control only
<LI>It should be up to the person or parent NOT Gov't
<LI>be regulated by home based share/software
<LI>parental responsibility
<LI>If you don't like it don't look.  Also parents should regulate what their children see, as they do for movies and tv
<LI>Parents should watch their kids
<LI>let censorship remain only in the home
<LI>how about a "V-CHIP" for computers, like t.v.?
<LI>The net should be completely open -- parents should monitor their children if they're concerned about what they might see.
<LI>parents are the ones concerned let them deal with it!
<LI>tt
<LI>morality standards are by nature the morality of the group, not the individual. repression is the most profound result when the group's ideals are placed above the individual's.  
<LI>add html tags rating sex/violence content of net
<LI>software lockouts ,similar to my cable box
<LI>Let business grow that sell filters for sexual explicit materials
<LI>ISP's can offer "Under 18 Accounts" (somewhat censored)
<LI>Why can't people be responsible?  Parents should be responsible for what their children see.
<LI>It should be up to the parents to control!
<LI>Ban children from the net
<LI>have a password to get into the sex lines on internet I would like to know some addresses but have not found any to get into this.
<LI>Rating system plus parental control.  Keeping children ignorant of sex and sexuality only serves as a problem, not a solution.  Children will experiment with or without government regulation and censorship.  While I believe that we should not keep this information from them entirely, I also feel that some children are not ready to be educated in some matters regarding sex, which is why a rating system is preferable over censorship and why parents should be allowed to block access to those sites rated "
ot suitable" for children of certain ages.
<LI>let parents restrict what kids see
<LI>parental obligation to censor their younger children
<LI>Install the equivelent to the V-chip in computers.
<LI>Ratings that only apply to sexuality w/violence
<LI>Remind parents THEIR children are THEIR responsibility
<LI>Let those who want to censor, self sensor their own access.
<LI>Give a golden shower to the US Senate
<LI>people shuold be in control of them selves and there p.c's
<LI>who gives a fuck
<LI>Use a PIN number for access to free Adult sites etc.
<LI>Rating System; Open to open-minded people; restricted to closed minded people.
<LI>arrange for personal codes 
<LI>Virtual ID
<LI>how about parenting?
<LI>Each household shold control who acceses the internet
<LI>fuck all starch collared conservative stick up ass nazi censoring cock smokers
<LI>The parents should be able to control what their children see on th the Net!
<LI>have much much more sex 
<LI>open except for exploitation of minors
<LI>If they don't like it then don't look at it.

 <H1><P ALIGN=CENTER>The REAL Conservative Conspiracy</H1>


<H2><P ALIGN=CENTER>aka "How to succeed in politics without really trying."</H2>

<H4>

<DD>Money makes the world go round.
<P>
This much might appear to be true; money is the great motivator, the great
communicator; that which separates the players from the pawns; the "winners"
from the "losers", etc.
<P>
Is the "Republican Revolution" about anything more than money?  I think not.
<P>
The American people are once-again being hoodwinked into beliving the party
line - not that any single party really has the right idea, but trust me
folks, it sure as hell isn't the conservatives/republicans!
<P>
While they love to bask in their own, completely ridiculous conspiracy
theories, such as this convoluted Whitewater/Vince Foster deal - a 
Washington "Witch Hunt" expressely designed to create bad PR for Clinton
at key moments in the campaign, they laud the "integrity" of Reagan, a
president who single-handedly pissed off most of the civiliized world
by invading Panama, and lied under oath in Congress along with most of
his administration, and set a new standard for using ignorance as a 
method of absolving oneself from the responsibility of office.  Only
the Republicans, with their multi-faceted PR machine headed by groups
such as the Christian Coalition and the NRA, could turn a two-faced,
defense-contractor-subsidized burned out hollywood star, into some sort
of political folk legend.  The worst part is that the American people
seem to buy this crap.  And what's behind it?  Money & power - the two of
which are synonymous in today's political arena.
<P>
<center><H2>The Environmental Issue</H2></center>
<P>
This is a good issue to use to exemplify the conservative conspiracy
theory.  They can't talk specifically about issues, instead, they have
a knack for lumping every opponent into some neat category in order to
be discounted; a popular one seems to be the "environmental wacko" group.
<P>
The conservatives want to abolish the EPA.  They claim environmental 
regulations stifle business.  Ok, sure that's true - if you want to build
an industrial waste processing facility in the middle of a residential
neighborhood, chances are there ARE government regulations standing in
your way.  If you want to harvest as much fish as you possibly can, 
regardless of whether it irreversibly depletes the stock; if you want
to dump some new pesticide on your crops that half the rest of the
world has banned, Uncle Sam has
rules to control this.  Is this so bad?  <I>The GOP loves to talk about giving
the states more power.</I>  This is all part of the conspiracy - it's much
easier to politically maneuver regionally than nationally - it's a lot
cheaper for the big corporations to buy local politicians than national
ones - who are generally more concerned about their image.  Our leaders
aren't doing the American people any favors by supposedly "reducing 
Washington beuracracy" - they're not reducing any red tape - they're 
transferring it from one group to another - and the latter group is
more-easily manipulated by business interests.  This also makes if easier
for them to cut funding - if they give block grants for ambiguous state-related
projects, they can cut the money in half, and it doesn't look like they're
taking food out of childrens' mouths - no, they're not doing that - it's the
state's PR problem now.
<P>
In order to substaniate my idea that there actually is some sort of
"conspiracy", we link two distinct politically-correct republican movements.
First I want to point out that in general, I don't necessarily believe 
that any political party really has some "master plan", but when you 
look at the relationship between some of these things, it starts to seem
a bit scary - take a look at the proposed legislation to put a cap on
damages for civil lawsuits...
<P>
The party line on this has to do with "Lawsuit abuse" - oh yes, let's run
a story about some lady who got some hot coffee from McDonalds and sued
for a few million dollars - yes that disgusts us - but let's admit the
truth - it only disgusts us because we wish it happened to US - we're
jealous that this woman could get some "easy money" and we have to work
our butts off.
<P>
Every day, there seems to be another carefully-planted story on some kook
who tries to sue the state, government or mega-corporation over a rather
trivial issue.  No amount of legislation is ever going to curb this trend - there
will always be people who will try to get some easy money from those that
have big bucks.  
<P>
These 'outrageous lawsuits' are probably the last bastion or justice that John Q. Public
has in the wake of corporate tomfoolery with the environment and the 
quality of their products.  We've already hears stories about major 
manufacturers, such as GM, who have defects in their products and have
determined that it's actually CHEAPER to settle the lawsuits brought
against them in these cases, rather than issue a recall and correct their
mistakes.  What happens if there is an even tighter limit on the maximum
amount of damages they may be liable for?  You guessed it.  We're screwed.
<P>
What happens when some oil company spills millions of gallons of oil into
the sea?  If they could get out of cleaning up this mess, and instead
settle a class-action suit for a significantly less amount of money,
what do you think they're going to do?  These corporations have more
loyalty to their shareholders than they do the environment.  And if the
republicans have their way, there won't be an EPA with any ability to
force them to correct their mistakes.  This isn't some hypothetical situation.
It's being carefully planned right now - the various elements to make this
work are being pushed through Congress in bite-sized pieces in order to 
seem like separate issues, but make no mistake, when you look at the big
picture, all this legislation has one dramatic effect: It reduces the 
ability of the American people (directly and indirectly) to control the destructive activities of
big business.
<P>
Let's take another issue into this scenario.  The current class-action
lawsuit against the tobacco companies - consider that companies such as
RJR are major players in pushing for this legislation to cap damages on
civil lawsuits - they probably know in the long run they can't hide the
fact that they knew about the addictive effects of nicotine and they indeed
did control its levels.  It's just a matter of time before they lose, but
you can bet they'll use their influence to reduce the amount of financial
liability they could be exposed to.  It's also interesting to note that
at the same time some groups are claiming that nicotine should be controlled
by the FDA, many republicans are also talking about abolishing the FDA as
well.  Perhaps by the time the courts publicly acknowledge that cigarettes
should be mandated under FDA control, the FDA will be abolished as well
and it won't matter?  It's not that outrageous of an idea - all of this
plays extremely well into the conservative party line having to do with
a bloated government.  Unfortunately, agencies like the FCC, FDA, EPA are
not the kinds of areas of government that should be reduced - there is no
acceptable regional alternative in these cases.
<P>
It's something to think about... <P>

<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_PREZ -->
<LI>Phil Gramm (he understands economics & values personal liberty)
<LI>Any capable and deserving individual.
<LI>Harry Browne - want true change and drastic reduction in federal governement
<LI>I'd like to see Gramm get his shot to complete the good work started in Gramm-Rudman
<LI>Pat Buchanan is the only candidate who has both the economic and cultural values I agree with.
<LI>Gramm is from common roots and is for the common man.  He will be good for business, especially small business, by dismantling lots of regulations, which burden small businesses more than they do big businesses.
<LI>Phil Gramm is the most honest and conservative of the candidates. No regulations with him.
<LI>Phil Gramm--we need an economist who understands free markets instead of a professional politician or demagogue.
<LI>Alan Keyes for President- "We don't have money problems; we have moral problems!"
<LI>I believe Alan Keyes has a proper perspective of the root cause of most of our current problems, and he would make this his top priority.
<LI>HARRY BROWNE-THE REPUBLICRATS HAD THIRE CHANCE
<LI>Alan Keyes - He presents truth, not political double-talk.
<LI>Gramm/Forbes '96!
<LI>Phil Gramm because he will cut welfare and and taxes, and repeal the assault weapon ban and the Brady Bill.
<LI>phil gramm, most conservative
<LI>Colin Powell, or some other moderate (gotta turn down the volume on this wretched partisan rhetoric!)
<LI>Gramm/Keyes 96
<LI>Phil Gramm - you always know where he stands
<LI>Phil Gramm.  Truely motivated by patriotism.  Ethical/good leader.
<LI>Harry Browne.  Everyone else is just business as usual, *especially* BOB DOLE (RINO extraordinaire).
<LI>Phil Gramm, has best chance of beating Clinton
<LI>Phil Gramm.
<LI>GRAMM - CHARACTER, LEADERSHIP, INTEGRITY, CONSERVATISM
<LI>jello biafra.  the only reasonably coherent and politically aware person currently "in action" at this time.  his "platform" is unique to say the least, yet functional.
<LI>Gramm will save us from disasters like getting our own troops bogged down in Bosnia. war has always been one of the greatest excuses for statism.
<LI>Phil Gramm will balance the budget by cutting spending and taxes.  He will get rid of lots of government regulations.  he's the only one who knows how.
<LI>Let's get Gramm in there so he can dismantle the welfare state and all the goverment regulations so we can be free again.
<LI>If only Phil Gramm were president, we could turn this country around and recreate the American Dream.
<LI>Harry Browne - to make this a free country once more.
<LI>Phil Gramm    He is the only true principled conservative.
<LI>Harry Browne.  The fed. government needs to be drastically cut.
<LI>phil gramm, most conservative
<LI>I believe that Harry Browne would be a good choice because he would check the Republican congress.  He would allow all bills dealing with smaller government but would halt Repub. intrusion into privacy etc.  Because many repubs are leaning libertarian he 
<LI>Senator Gramm would be the best.  He has the best ideas of any candidate in the race; he's the most consistent on the issues.
<LI>I'd like to see Gramm become president.  He's the only one who can complete the Reagan Revolution of less government and more freedom.
<LI>Bill Clinton is far better than what is out there right now.
<LI>Phil Gramm- He's the only consistently true conservative
<LI>Rick Tompkins.  He's the only real principle Libertarian running for president
<LI>Gore -- he can campaign while Clinton governs
<LI>Phil Gramm is the only decent one of the lot who can win.  The only other half-way decent one is Forbes, and he can't win since he appeals only to a portion of the economic conservatives, and not at all to social conservatives.  To win the nomination and the election, the candidate must appeal to both social conservatives and economic conservatives.  Only Gramm does that.
<LI>Someone who knows that we need to balance the budget, and temporarily increase taxes. Someone who wants to reform welfare so that it works but who doesn't want to shred the safety net. Someone who knows when to get involved in foreign policy negotiations,
<LI>Senator Phil Gramm is the only truly libertarian candidate who can win in 1996.
<LI>Keyes...Leadership and communication skills
<LI>Phil Gramm, social & fiscal conservative
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Gramm has honesty, integrity, courage, and conservative convcition.
<LI>The republican nominee so that Republican agenda can pass
<LI>I like Gramm because he believes in a limited government. I also like Harry Browne, but I don't believe that he has a chance of being elected.
<LI>If there's anyone in Washington who will say, "no!" it's Senator Gramm.  He says no so fascist health care, not to gun control, no to Mexican bailouts, no to increased spending, no to sending troops to Bosnia.  We need to elect him President so he can say NO to the entire welfare-regulatory state.
<LI>PHIL GRAMM KNOWS THE BENEFITS OF CUTTING TAX RATES, BUT ALSO OF CUTTING SPENDING, AND OF LIBERTY IN MEDICINE AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS.
<LI>Phil Gramm.  Do you know that Steve Forbes used to write glowing praise of Gramm in Forbes magazine?  Vote for Phil Gramm: the candidate endorsed by the old Steve Forbes.
<LI>Phil Gramm, because of his econimic experience, fiscal conservatism, and how he stands on his principals.
<LI>Phil Gramm; only he is truly committed to a limited government
<LI>Phil Gramm because he has the best chance of shrinkin government.
<LI>Phil Gramm / Phil is in touch with the American people and has consistently voted his convictions over the years.  He has no hidden agenda and seems to be a statesman not a politician.
<LI>Browne-reduce gov's intrusion into individual & states rights
<LI>Phil Gramm is leading the opposition in the Senate to the Clinton-Dole deployment of US troops to Bosnia.  
<LI>It's amazing just how close we came to having Clinton socialize health care in this country.  Dole and 22 Republican senators were on board for some version of a government take over of our health care.  But when things looked darkest for our liberty, Phil Gramm was the one man who said, "Clinton's health care plan will pass over my cold, dead, political body."  I knew right then I would be supporting him for president.  Gramm almost single-handedly killed the socialist health care montser in America. 
Than
<LI>Steve Forbes.  He is the only true 'pro-growth' candidate.
<LI>Phil Gramm because he was for free markets back when liberal Republicans like Nixon and Buchanan were imposing wage and price controls (remember Phase I and Phase II?!) on our liberty.
<LI>Charles Collins. Best constitutional candidate.
<LI>Pat Buchanan since he's not the waffler and liar Dole is!
<LI>Phill Gramm- Will end affirmative action.
<LI>Phil Gramm, he is a true conservative and stands by his word.
<LI>Buchanan - he is saying things many of us are saying, and most politicians don't have the guts to say.
<LI>Steve Forbes because he understands that capitalism engenders human progress, moral and economic.
<LI>Gramm - Conservative, and he doesn't waffle on the issues
<LI>gramm  he is a good man and will do somthing about welfare
<LI>Harry Brown, because he is coming from a constitutioanlly sound direction. We have been adding too many "frills and gagets" into government over the past two hundred years. These additions may have been started for exellent reasons, but they have gotten too bloated, and are not readdresssed for their present usefullness.
<LI>Alan Keyes is the best conservative/libertarian candidate since Ronald Reagan.
<LI>I'm sure Gramm's the best candidate for the job.  He's right on taxes, spending and foreign policy.  He's got the economics down cold.
<LI>Phil Gramm, for his consistency of message and leadership.
<LI>Only H browne and S Forbes "talk" the less government talk, I know HB would walk the walk.
<LI>I would very much like to see Senator Phil Gramm of Texas be the next president.  He has the Texas grit and horse-sense to get things done, and is and honorable conservative as well.
<LI>Phil Gramm is on the cutting edge of conservatism.  While the Contract With America promised to de-entitle only 5 welfare entitlements, Gramm proposed a bill which would de-entitle all 9 non-medical entitlements.  While the other candidates make vague promises about cutting goverment, Gramm is already doing it.  Just imagine how much more he'll be able to do as president!
<LI>Phil Gramm would make an ideal president.  He's of humble origins, yet has attained success through hard work and brain-power.  And that's the best sort of conservative.
<LI>Phil Gramm is just a plain, good conservative. How fancy rhetoric or foaming at the mouth.  Just common sense and decency--what conservatism is all about.
<LI>Phil Gramm- he holds traditional American values (work ethics, personal responsibility) in high regard, he tells you what he thinks & why and he doesn't back down...these are all qualities that the "alleged" front-runners, Bill Clinton and Bob Dole sorely lack  (Powell also lacks these).
<LI>Phil Gramm - he will do what needs to be done to balance the budget
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is a man truly set in the ideals of our founding fathers
<LI>I would like to see Phil Gramm as President in 1996 to help put this nation on a more sound financial and moral course, something few other candidates will be capable of doing.
<LI>honesty, consistency and character
<LI>Gramm isn't a single-issue candidate with other issues tacted on as an after-thought like Buchanan, Keyes, and Forbes.  He is the only full-issue conservative candidate.
<LI>Gramm has found the narrow road of sanity between the isolationist demagogues like Buchanan and the willy-nilly interventionists like Dole and Clinton.  Bravo!
<LI>Phil Gramm can be counted on to stand for liberty and against Big Government.
<LI>Senator Gramm is the most impressive conservative on the block
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is willing to seriously cut government back.
<LI>Gramm is so good he's the only candidate who doesn't have to distort the record of his rivals.
<LI>Bill Clinton--Noone else is worth a grain of thought.
<LI>From avaliable choices, Bill Clinton because there seems to be too much hate and intolerance boing on in this country. Remember without tolerance we become Balkanized.
<LI>Alan Keyes because of his moral convictions
<LI>Bill Clinton
<LI>Of all the choices, I think Clinton is the most likely. I can't see any of the Republicans becoming president, they would simply slash and burn without thinking.
<LI>Alan Keyes
<LI>Paul Tsongos, because he's honest & pratical
<LI>Forbes -- best supply sider w/o Kemp running
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate willing to save this country from economic disaster and really cut spending.
<LI>Gramm is right on all the issues, and has the most pro-liberty record of any candidate running.
<LI>I would like to see Phil Gramm become president in 1996.  He is the only one who has pledged to balance the budget in one term or not run for reeclection.  And he will do it while cutting tax rates too.  He is already working to dismantle the Commerce Department and make sure the Senate keeps the promises in the Republican Contract With American.
<LI>Harry Browne; I believe that the people in this country need to reduce their dependancy on large centralized government and become more self reliant, and Harry Browne stands for that.
<LI>If Gramm were president we wouldn't be debating how much to slow down the growth rate of government and whether to have tiny tax cuts.  We'd be debating just how much to CUT spending and taxes.
<LI>I appreciate Gramm's integrity and conservatism
<LI>Gramm is unparalleled for his honesty, integrity, and knowlege of economics.  He would be the best by far of all the candidates.
<LI>Gramm is a real optimist--in every speech he says, "The good news is that there's not a problem we face today we can't fix" yet is realistic enough to know and honest enough to admit that the solutions will cause some people some pain.  He's not a pie-in-the-sky sort who thinks marginal tax cuts will fix everything.
<LI>I find Phil Gramm so inspiring.
<LI>I like Phil Gramm because he is brilliant yet the media elites hate him more than any other candidates.  He's the best conservative, and they're terrified of him.
<LI>Without Gramm, Dole and Domenici would have cut a deal with Clinton on the budget already.  If Gramm is "Dr. No" I say yes to Gramm!
<LI>Gramm isn't slick like Willie or most of the Republicans preachers and politicians running against him.  He's an example of the American Dream--grew up poor but made good.  And his wife's another example--her grandfather came over as an indetured servant from Korean to work in the sugar cane field of Hawaii.  Her dad went to college and became an executive for the company that employed his father <the grandfather>.  She because CFTC Chair, and deregulated the industry.  THAT is the sort of American Dre
m co</TH>
<LI>You always get more government than you voted for; therefore I support Harry Browne, Libertarian.
<LI>Phil Gramm - Ibelieve that he will bring back the American Drean drea
<LI>Bill Clinton: Has courage to see the long term issues
<LI>Alan Keyes would make the best president, but 
<LI>Gramm isn't bamboozled by social engineering, whether it's Democrats telling us who we can hire, or Republicans tellingus from whom we can buy,
<LI>We need a smart, tough conserative like Gramm.
<LI>Phil Gramm. A true conservative.
<LI>Gramm knows the most about free markets and individual liberty.
<LI>Someone who is honest has integrity and will stand up for what is right.
<LI>Gramm stand up to the whiners in the GOP--he can stand up to the liberal whiners too.
<LI>Gramm has what it takes to complete the Reagan Revolution--the way it should be.
<LI>STEVE FORBES IS AN OUTSIDER AND CAN LOOK AT THINGS IN A NEW WAY.
<LI>Gramm killed the Clinton socialist health care plan.  He was the only one with the guts to go on the national media and call it socialism.
<LI>Harry Browne because he's the only one that is committed to reducing government the most.
<LI>Gramm, he supports the Contract with America's goals
<LI>Harry Browne -- He's Libertarian and libertarian.
<LI>Gramm is a great, consistent leader.  He knows how to talk to common folks as well as to intelletuals.  He is a man for all seasons.  He will be the greatest president of the 20th century.
<LI>If Colin Poweel would run, I would vote for him simply because the man is a true independent and has no ties to either party. I am sick of the partisan posturing of both parties, and i honestly feel that both parties are moribund and have out-lived their usefulness.
<LI>Bob Dole: Experience, Virtues
<LI>Gramm. he is the most fiscally conservative candidate
<LI>Bill Clinton, the only one looking out for the average guy.
<LI>Gramm is the smartest and toughest conservative candidate around.  He keeps his promises.
<LI>Alan Keyes;  He is telling the truth about our country.  He speaks to my heart.  He is logical in his arguments and believes what he says. We don't have money problems, we have moral problems.
<LI>Clinton, the lesser of all evils.
<LI>Harry Browne We need to stop politics as usual and REALLY cut government.  
<LI>Harry Browne, who would immediately pardon all nonviolent "criminals" (drugs, sex, mere gun possession), and dramtically reduce the size and intrusiveness of the Federal government.
<LI>Me, Michael Burt, The KING OF CHAOS, because I'm willing to make the big cuts needed in government.
<LI>Rick Tompkins, because he is the best of the Libertarian candidates, and the only one who truly understands and talks about the principles of being a Libertarian. He loves liberty, and wants everyone to have a chance at it.        
<LI>Forbes.  He can be counted on to do the single best thing for the economy -- cut capital gains taxes.
<LI>Rick Tompkins, because he most clearly represents my viewpoints. He has principles and integrity. Mr. Tompkins has the wisdom, the perseverance and the abilities to hold the office of president.       
<LI>Phil Gramm:  He is the only candidate with a PLAN for solving Economic problems
<LI>Alan Keyes - He is what the country needs an honest, conservative leader.
<LI>I really don't know, because I feel that most people who have more than a snowball's chance in hell of winning lie, cheat, and are basically crooks.
<LI>Bob Dole - Integrity and Honesty
<LI>Charles Collins - I think he addresses the underlying issues, not the false front issues pushed by the press. He would realistically trim much of the government that we could do without. He'd reduce entitlements, but keep programs that help people get ahe
<LI>Gramm is the MAN.  The only one with both the common sense and the economics training and the courage to make the tough choices to turn around the goverment and restore our liberty.
<LI>Rick Tompkins, Libertarian. But Harry Brown will do, and has a good chance. The Fed.Gov is far out of control, and needs to be vivisected back into its constitutional restraints.
<LI>Gramm has an excellent record, not just excellent rhetoric like some candidates.  A record of fighting to cut taxes and spending.  Dole Lugar and Alexander have lousy records.Buchanan, Keyes, Browne, Forbes have no record, and can say anything they want.  Powell isn't running; wake up Powell supporters!  And of course, Clinton has an abyssmal record--so bad that he's been GREAT for the cause of liberty.
<LI>Phil Gramm: Honest, brilliant, conservative, courageous
<LI>Phil Gramm - Reduce size of Fed. Govt., Balance Budget, Lower Taxes, Eliminate Wasteful Spending, Reduce Govt. Regulations (EPA), Provide environment for positive Economic growth.
<LI>Phill Gramm: Honest, brilliant, conservative, courageous
<LI>I would prefer a libertarian president that agrees to adhere completely to the constitution.
<LI>Harry Brown is the only candidate I have seen who realizes that Government doesn't work and must be drastically cut immediately
<LI>Alan Keyes hit the nail on the head when he said the basis for  Americas problems is the MORALITY factor.
<LI>Alan Keyes - Positions on Abortion and Rhetorical and Leadership skill
<LI>Phil Gramm, because I want to give  a basically conservative governement (all three branches) a CHANCE to show what it can do. Liberal DEmocrats have already had this opportunity in the past.
<LI>Phil Gramm - he has guts enough to make needed changes.
<LI>Even now Gramm is battling to force Congress to: 1. pass the tax cuts; 2. stop the Bosnian deployment; pass reall welfare reform; 4. de-entitle school lunches.  THAT is the sort of leadership we need in the White House!
<LI>pat, hes the only one nearly conservitive enough for me I want revolution - its time to demolish DC
<LI>Alan Keyes He is the one who puts the family as #1 priority.
<LI>Pat Buchanan, because his views are closely inline with mine; and he is the most honest politician speaking out on the issues.
<LI>Phil Gramm will cut spending and cut tax rates.
<LI>Phil Gramm: He has been consistent his entire term of public service; he will cut the debt; he will reduce government intrusion into private homes and businesses.  He will maintain our world class status in business, manufacturing, and defense and help us
<LI>Roy Romer, the governor of Colorado, because he knows how to
<LI>Myself; The first item on my agenda would be to declare every day a government holiday.
<LI>Colin Powell because we need a _real_ change.
<LI>colin powell has integrity
<LI>We need someone as tough as Phil Gramm to stand up to the Beltway establishment.  Gramm is the only one tough enough.
<LI>Phil Gramm. Not just another pretty face.
<LI>I would have loved to have seen Gen. Powell and think he stood a good chance of winning. He was conservative enough to get along with the Republicans, but still open-minded and fair.
<LI>Gramm - He is the best leader for our country.
<LI>Someone who takes his oath of office seriously
<LI>Alan Keyes because he is the only one who understands our nation's problems and how to fix them!
<LI>Lamar Alexander, he is from outside Washington and he has a good record
<LI>A candidate who understands the constitution and abides ther
<LI>Barry Goldwater because he's the only honest man with political experience.
<LI>Someone with an objective and open mind
<LI>Harry Browne will eliminate income tax and Social Security and the drug war.
<LI>Harry Browne To rein in over intrusive governmnt
<LI>Phil Gramm   He apppears to be saying the things that I believe are important for our country.
<LI>Phil Gramm: he's consistantly conservative and Pro-Life
<LI>phil gramm or alan keyes because they have the power to motivate and to get people to take action.
<LI>Phil Gramm - he is willing to do what is right vs. what is expedient.
<LI>Harry Browne .. Big government does NOT work..  Nor should the state dictate moral values..
<LI>Browne--For freedom in all senses of the word
<LI>Rick Tompkins, who is opposing Harry Browne for the Libertarian nomination. Rick is a principled advocate of liberty and will represent the true meaning of the Libertarian Party's philosophy of freedom.He stands unabashed for the principles of individual liberty on which this country was founded.
<LI>Whoever gets the Republican nomination.  Clinton must be defeated.
<LI>Phil Gramm is the one hope to save the Republican Revolution from the moderates like Dole and Alexander on one side, and the demogogues like Buchanan and Keyes on the other.
<LI>I like Phil Gramm by far the best.  He has a long history of supporting free markets and cutting the federal government.
<LI>Harry Browne because he is the only candidate that is serious about cutting the size of government.
<LI>Gramm sticks to his guns, and they are conservative guns.
<LI>Harry Browne is most likely to seriously slasch government.
<LI>I would like to see HarryBrowne, since he is the most likely to cut government.
<LI>Alan Keyes, for his moral stand
<LI>Moderate Republican
<LI>Gramm is great!  Gramm is fun!  Gramm's the man for everyone!
<LI>Let's get serious.  Phil Gramm is the only true conservative who can possibly win.  We all need to unite behind him or Dole will get the GOP nomination.
<LI>A libetarian (small l) with interest in regulatory approaches to environmental protection
<LI>Phil Gramm, the only real candidate with integrity.
<LI>Phil Gramm was the only one willing to filibuster to stop Clinton's gun grabs.  He also threatened to filibuster the Clinton socialized medicine plan.  Imagine what he can do with a VETO!
<LI>Phil Gramm -- He knows what he stands for; he says what he stands for; AND he says the same thing EVERYTIME he says it.  I think he would keep his campaign promises and deliver what is best for the country.
<LI>Gramm: the only honest one in the bunch.
<LI>Gramm.  With the guts to stand up to the Iowa and New Hampshire party establishments, this man will be able to stand up to the liberal media in the Beltway.
<LI>Phil Gramm, the only economist in the Senate.  We need a real free market economist like Gramm in the White House.
<LI>Phil Gramm stands for the principles of limited government and individual liberty.
<LI>Bob Dple: He is experienced and the time is right.
<LI>Spock & Data, the logical choice!
<LI>Phil Gramm - because he takes firm positions rather than waffling like Clinton and Dole.
<LI>Pat Buchanan, he seems to be the only one who can read (the Constitution that is) or else the others just lie through their teeth all the time.
<LI>Alan Keyes--he's the only one so far who has taken a true moral stand for the good of America, not himself!
<LI>Alan Keyes - he wants the government out of our life
<LI>Harry Browne--restoration of Constitutional government
<LI>Harry Browne, because the government is too large/powerful/intrusive

<LI>Phil Gramm--offers our best opportunity to see lower taxes, a reduced deficit (leading to lower interest rates), sound economic reasoning, supportive of free enterprise
<LI>Someone with fresh ideas and balls

<LI>Phil Gramm is a staunch conservative who also appeals to Reagan Democrats.  He's the only one who can beat Clinton.
<LI>Phil Gramm, a man of principle.
<LI>Gramm. He doesn't lie like Buchanan, Keyes, Dole, and even Forbes.

<LI>Bob Dole, grown up leadership, vision, and integrity.
<LI>Harry Browne - The only candidate who will reduce government and restore freedom NOW!
<LI>Harry Browne, Like me, He believes people can solve problems better than the government.
<LI>DAN QUAYLE  HE IS NOT GIVEN CREDIT FOR DOING A GREAT JOB.
<LI>Forbes, for tax and budget control

<LI>Phil Gramm simply because I believe in everything he stands for, and I like his common sense, simple approach.  I also feel he fits my traditional morals, and is more strict than the others
<LI>Phil Gramm for president!  The only true conservative who can win.
<LI>Mr. Browne, He has very reasonable ideas,I feel I could support.
<LI>Lamar Alexander.  Believes that states should be allowed to solve their own problems, not the Fed. government.
<LI>Phil Gramm - Leadership he has shown on taking a stand on controversal issues.

<LI>some one will cut cut cut cut cut and cut some more
<LI>I wish Kemp ran!
<LI>Gramm is a true conservative who sticks to principles of free markets.  He doesn't pander to union leftists with protectionism like Buchanan.  Gramm doesn't say such anti-liberty things as "you don't have the right to do what's wrong" like Keyes does.  And Gramm will really cut goverment, not just cut tax rates to give us BIGGER government like Forbes proposes.  Also, Gramm will keep us out of Bosnia, while Dole and Lugar lead us in.  And Gramm can actually be elected, unlike Harry Browne.
<LI>I like Phil Gramm because he will bring real change without being mean like Buchanan, but won't be waffling like Dole or Alexander.

<LI>Phil Gramm, he has the most consistent vision of limited government, low taxes, and more federalism.

<LI>Alan Keyes because he has insight/courage to speak the truth.
<LI>Someone who's convictions match those of our founding fathers, that's why ALAN KEYES ought to BE ON ALL YOUR LISTS!
<LI>Harry Browne. He's tje only candidate with principles.
<LI>Phil Gramm, the most libertarian Republican.
<LI>Phil Gramm, he means what he says and says what he means.  He is serious about addressing the problems we face. He is consistent and persistent.
<LI>Phil Gramm. Bob Dole is really too old for the American people to reasonably accept. He's probbably up to the task, but in my opinion, he's not nearly conservative enough. I think we need to get the government out of people's faces, get spending under control and stop yammering about gun control and do something significant about criminals. Bill Clinton has what I think is the MOST scandal-ridden administration in my memory, and that includes Nixon.  In addition, he's so wishy washy on virtually everyt
ing but gun control, and he has no credibitlity. He talks out of both sides of his mouth and goes the way of the wind on just about everything. You just can pin him down. I guess that's why they call him "Slick Willy".
<LI>Phil Gramm is my first choice!  With Thomas Sowell for his running mate.  If it comes down to Dole or Clinton it is not worth voting as they are both of the same ideology, just to a different degree.
<LI>Phil Gramm, in order to protect our rights and liberty
<LI>I would like to see Phil Gramm elected president because of his view of the role of government, his strong character, and moral integrity.
<LI>Harry Browne to cut the size of government
<LI>I would have liked to seen Colin Powell very much, because I think he's a fine citizen and American and while I don't agree with all of his views, I think overall, he would have done a good job. 
<LI>Harry Browne, or Ross Perot, since they won't charge me as much to decide how to spend my money...
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Phil Gramm because of his tough stands on crime, welfare and taxes.  He is a man of conviction and principle, and that's who I want in the White House.
<LI>Phil Gramm -- He is serious about reducing the size and scope of government.  He offers tough, principled, and compassionate leadership as well as a clear, concise, and consistent message.
<LI>Harry Browne.  His policies, moderated by a Republican/Democrat dominated Congress, will move the United States back towards small, relatively unintrusive government.
<LI>Sen. Bill Bradley or Lowell Weicker
<LI>Gramm with Keyes as his running mate
<LI>Phil Gramm.  I rarely disagree with his positions.  He's strong on issues that matter to me.
<LI>Bob Dole, He is fight back for the people who pay the Bills

<LI>Alan Keyes, because he alone recognizes America's moral crisis.
<LI>Alan Keyes, because he is focusing his campaign on the root cause of all the.
<LI>Phil Gramm - hard to explain in just one line!
<LI>Phil Gramm -- he's the last best hope to do something about the size and scope of government
<LI>Phil Gramm     less government
<LI>Phil Gramm for his fiscal, cultural, & constitutional conservatism
<LI>Rick Tompkins has the most libertarian vision for the country, but Browne has the best chances
<LI>Alan Keyes has the best understanding of the root cause of our national problems.
<LI>Almost anyone other than Bill Clinton...But I would prefer Gen. Schwartzkopf...who unfortunately has more sense than to get into politics.  He has global savy, having served on several continents, management ability, having managed hundreds of thousands of men, and respect for and concern for his troops, which would translate to concern for the ordinary citizen. Also, he isn't a political animal, as are all those currently running for, and IN office.  We could use the change.
<LI>Somebody who will restore the Constitution to **LAW**
<LI>Phill Gramm!  We need a president that will do something about the national debt.

<LI>Phil Gramm, who can be trusted to support more liberty and less goverment in most instances.  By the way, you have his first name spelled wrong.
<LI>a candidate who is committed to reducing the size of govt.
<LI>I'd like to see Phil Gramm as president because he is the most libertarian of any candidate who can possibly win the nomination.He'd also be the most classical liberal president since Calvin Coolidge, and possibly since Grover Cleveland.He does what he says he's going to do, and doesn't pander even to the interest groups within his own party.
<LI>Harry Browne, If at halftime your gameplan is not working you better make changes
<LI>Bill is doing a great job. Big bussiness is leaving country, and downsizing, poor economic times, The Corporate WHITE BOYS are doing a number on all of us!!
<LI>not a professional politician!
<LI>Harry Browne - I want government to be smaller, not to grow slowly
<LI>Bob Dole because he knows how to work with congress and he represents most of my views.
<LI>dole happydays    
<LI>I would like to see Alan Keyes for president in 1996 because he is the only candidate who is willing to tell us what the true problem is in our society; that is that we have a moral problem!
<LI>JESSE JACKSON, though he will NEVER will, righteous man that he is.
<LI>Alan Keyes -- a leader with a vision.  An honest man.
<LI>Keyes- best represents my views
<LI>Bill Clinton
<LI>Alan Keyes because he takes a strong stand for moral values and he has experience in many areas.  He is a very knowledgeable man and is the only  candidate to say that abortion is taking of a human life and that our country can not exist when we say that murder is okay.
<LI>Colin Powell would've been the best LEADER, but candidate?  I'm not sure.  I'll probably vote Libertarian to make a statement against the status quo.
<LI>Alan Keyes, because we don't have money problems, we have moral problems!
<LI>Clinton, unless the Republicans produce a moderate,youthful,visionary that does not serve the upper class            
<LI>The act of becoming a candidate ruins most candidates.
<LI>Colin Powell: he would've been new blood (literally!!)
<LI>Alan Keyes because he has a vision for uniting America and leading this country back to a moral foundation.
<LI>Alan Keyes ... only candidate who sees the real problem in America ... immorality
<LI>Harry Browne: To protect personal liberty
<LI>Alan Keyes
<LI>Harry Browne  He's the only legitimate candidate that will REDUCE the amount of government intrusion into my life!
<LI>Harry Browne  He's the only legitimate candidate that will REDUCE the amount of government intrusion into my life!
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Alan Keyes- He gets to the heart of our nation's problems, with no beating around the bush.
<LI>Dole, because he's intelligent, experienced, and is not     a draft dodger        
<LI>Alan Keyes...he is an honest man with a positive plan for America.
<LI>keyes - only man who has a clue what's important
<LI>Harry Browne. He is honest and will do what he says he will do.
<LI>Someone without strings attached--Browne- Forbes
<LI>Alan Keyes, for a return to government as a moral force for good rather than evil.
<LI><strong><A HREF="http://sandh.com/keyes/index.html"><img src = "http://www.keyes.gocin.com/key3.gif">Alan Keyes '96!</strong></a></A> </STRONG> 
<LI>I would have liked to have seen Tommy Thompson (R, Wisconsin) because he has done great things for the state of Wisconsin, and I would like the rest of the nation to see what a great man he really is.
<LI>Charles Collins:  His "back to the constitution" platform and I perceive him to be honest, unlike so many other candidates.
<LI>Harry Browne--because he's the only one who's honest about the nature of government itself.
<LI>No body else is perfect, but I'll stick with Clinton; Clinton can learn, others don't seem to have that capability
<LI>Keyes I WANT, but I SEE Gramm or Dole.  Keyes has a moral message, and that takes time to explain that is the true route that we must take to get rid of our problems, therefore he needs considerable resources to do so... he doesn't have them.  We need some HARDCORE counter-media explosion!
<LI>Bill Clinton / no better choices
<LI>Bob Dole
<LI>Bill Clinton because he is the only one that is working for the people's best interest
<LI>Pat Buchanan- He opposes big gov't and big bus.-he is a cultural and economic nationalist
<LI>me or general Colin Powell.  Because career polititions too easily lose sight of that which is really important and the only true reason for becoming a "public servant"... serving the people of this nation and ballsy political reform.
<LI>Harry Browne, because government dosen't work.
<LI>Alan Keyes, because he recognizes that breakdown of family and moral decay is root of most of our problems today.
<LI>Harry Browne.  The policies he supports are more inline with my beliefs than any of the other candidates' are.
<LI>Alan Keyes - Unafraid to take a stand for what is morally right.  I believe a man like this is needed to lead our country out of the morally bankrupt dependency upon Government intervention to solve individuals' problems.
<LI>Harry Browne; The only one that might turn this mess around
<LI>Bill Clinton, he has proven he can do the job and I don't believe anyone else could do any better.
<LI>Richard Lugar--I like his consumption tax idea
<LI>Alan Keyes - He is a good person that could make a difference in our country!!!
<LI>ALAN KEYES!!! He is the ONLY candidate who currently addresses convincingly the source of ALL the problems in this country-the moral breakdown. He is not a politics-as-usual candidate, but a true statesman we can all look up to.
<LI>harry browne - I think the federal government has stepped way beyond its constitutional bounds
<LI>none of the announced candidates, so far.
<LI>Alan Keyes:  Because he is coxcientous frank, persuasive, and right about the afflictions of the nation.
<LI>Alan Keyes, he is an honest man, who is addressing major problems with viable solutions.
<LI>Alan Keyes. His message is that of morality & family strengthening.
<LI>Roger Waters (Pink Floyd)
<LI>Get Bill Clinton out of office!  Anyone who can send our millitary to war should have first served in it! We can send 2 billion dollars to russia but we have people that dont have a house. He voted down a ballanced budget. H is the worst president I have ever seen. I say this because he is. If he was a republican I would still say the same thing.  He has no respect for the second amendment. The freedom to keep and bear arms. Hes passing laws that dont hurt anyone but law abiding citizens.
<LI>Harry Browne -- time for REAL cuts in govt. and taxes
<LI>Colin Powell
<LI>Alan Keyes - He seems to be the most sincere of all candidates
<LI>Phil Gramm as he espouses the choices that I clicked above.
<LI>Alan Keyes: Clear commitment to the Declaration of Independence.
<LI>Alan Keyes: Agrees with my beliefs AND priorities
<LI>Alan Keyes...Conservative morally and fiscally
<LI>Mario Cuomo--he could lead our country.. 2nd choice Clinton
<LI>Alan Keyes - He has a moral position and lives by it.
<LI>Alan Keyes--A man of ultimate integrity with the gumption to back it up is who we need to fix the MORALITY problem in America today.
<LI>Just a little integrity would be nice.
<LI>Steven Forbes, he has the business acumen and political insight to be different and truly make a difference in federal government.
<LI>Someone who will actualy make some REAL change in the the way thing are done in this country.
<LI>Harry Browne!!!
<LI>colin powell- others are way too conservative
<LI>Hary Browne. He reflects my beliefs.
<LI>Clinton - Closest to main stream American values
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Bill Clinton, we still need to be able to breathe, be able to drink our water, to have a educated society, have some decent leadership, and all other positive liberal reforms, except tobacco regulation and gun control
<LI>A VERY CONSERATIVE REPUBLICAN  IE GINGRICH OR GRAMM
<LI>Bill Clinton; he can turn things around if Congress turns Democratic again...
<LI>Harry Browne because he knowledge and skills to lead this country to true freedom
<LI>Dole.  I see him as a moderate conservative.  I believe the Republican Party is more apt to reduce spending in areas that have completely gotten out of control.
<LI>Bill Clinton-He's done a good job but CAN do better
<LI>Forbes--may bring fiscal sanity
<LI>Barry Goldwater because he's the last American.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he wants to make the government small.
<LI>I would like to see Rev. Jesse Jackson in the 1996-2000 presidency because he has been the only candidate in the last 15 years to deal with the real issues of the everyday people in America.  The farmer, the security guard, the student and the labor worke
<LI>I want to see a president who can lead, not follow. That is a president's duty. To me, true executive leadership has been lost to politics and bargaining. If a president cannot lead his congress, regardless of party affiliations, then he is not a leader.
<LI>http://www.HarryBrown96.org<img src="http://www.HarryBrowne96.org/sign-wave-v.jpg">
<LI>Harry Browne, we need dramatic changes, not incremental changess. He is the only candidate willing to address the major issues with real impactt. Real change.
<LI>Sam Nunn, Al Gore
<LI>Harry Browne; Individual Freedom and Constitution supporter
<LI>I'd like to see Mario Cuomo.  No ideas are articulated well.
<LI>I don't know who I want for President. I like the Libertarian views but I don't know enough about you or the party. I will read on.
<LI>Bob Dole is electable and would restore the integrity in the white house that's been lost since 92
<LI>It's as simple as ABC (Anybody But Clinton)
<LI>Probably Bubba, 'cause there just ain't anybody else that'll do the job who is running in '96
<LI>I want to see someone in no party who only wants the job for four years.
<LI>harry browne we need the change
<LI>Bill Clinton. The priorities of Bill Clinton are more rational and humane than those of the republicans.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he doesn't believe our problems are best solved by the government.
<LI>Although he has said he wouldn't run, I'd like to see Colin Powell in the White House.  Unfortunately, the President is only a small part of the problem.
<LI>Lowell Weicker
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Pat Buchanan, only one that even slightly represents interests of the South and its people.
<LI>someone who will leave me alone
<LI>Buchanan! We meed a President that will work for the Nation not to establish  a socielsit State OR ONE THAT IS WORKING FOR GLOBAL CORPORATIONS OR THEIR OWN POCKET BOOKS.  
<LI>Bob Dole, I think he is best ofr the job and not Clinton
<LI>Bill Clinton, because he listens and do the will of the people.  Unlike republicans who tell you what you want.
<LI>An individualist LEADER who will ignore these surveys and follow his own vision for America.  Hmmm.  I'm assuming, of course, that his vision does not include dictatorship or a military regime.
<LI>Colin Powell
<LI>Harry Browne, for a free country!
<LI>Harry Browne - he is the most  responsible, well-spoken candidate. He will reduce governmentNOW!
<LI>Bill Clinton has demonstrated himself to be a peacemaker.  Granted, he has stumbled and waffled at times, but I feel he has been an effective advocate for the average American.
<LI><img src="http://www.HarryBrowne96.org/logo.gif">
<LI>Harry Browne- screw the GOP/Democrat fascist pigs
<LI>Clinton.. he's the only one not way off in his own world
<LI>Pat Buchanan   Integrity
<LI>Harry
<LI>Harry Browne - he'll give us control of our lives back!
<LI>Harry Browne, he'd radically reduce gov't & return this to a free country.
<LI>Steve Forbes I think. Having a hard time finding just where he stands on abortion, gun control, and other smaller issues.
<LI>Harry Browne--only credible Libertarian.  Also, Republicans and Democrats are not serious about reducing government interference.
<LI>Bill Bennett he is intelligent and decent (but he wont' run)
<LI>Bill Clinton, mainly because I can not in good consious vote for Dole.  All the other candidates seem even more conservative and I can not vote for that.  Clinton has done a decent job and I am not dissatified with the work he has done.
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Republicans and Democrats aren't serious about reducing government power; only Libertarian Harry Browne is.
<LI>Harry Browne, because socialism and paternalism sucks
<LI>BOB DOLE, WE HAVE ENOUGH OF THE CLINTON LIBERALISM
<LI>Lowell Weicker
<LI>Bill Clinton
<LI>harry browne: no income taxes=more federal revenue!
<LI>Powell, we need a leader with good moral values.
<LI>Bill Clinton:  he is more qualified than Browne.
<LI>Harry Browne... only American choice
<LI>Bill Clinton.  Because the radical right must be stopped!!!
<LI>Even though he's not running, Colin Powell. Why not?
<LI>Clinton - He's least likely to cowtow to the radical "religious" right.
<LI>Steve Forbes Bring in an outsider and tax reform
<LI>harry browne-wants to end the War on Drugs
<LI>Alan Keyes, because he is a man of high integrity and character who is not afraid to take a stand for what is right
<LI>It would be nice to see a politician in power who would actually keep their promises, bring back the death penalty for child molestors, rapists, murderers, and drug dealers, someone who would bring religion back into the schools, someone who would stop all the bloody illegal immigrants from coming in, someone who actually CARED about doing good, instead of being on a continual power trip---but seeing as there is no one who will do any of this, I guess we'll have to wait for the Second Coming.
<LI>Harry, we need to get away from the two party system and get back to what's best for the United States.
<LI>Harry Browne/ Too much government
<LI>Someone who is more interested in fixing things than staying in office.
<LI>Harry Browne/ Less Government
<LI>Harry Browne: Redudce government, its debt, iterferance, & size.
<LI>Dole + republican congress will get things in order....
<LI>Harry Browne- He is not going to try to fix government, he is going to cut it drstically. Government doesn,t work! 
<LI>BUCHANAN
<LI>Harry Browne -- we need to reform (reduce) government now
<LI>Harry Browne because he actually thinks before he speaks.
<LI>Harry Browne.  Government is much, much too large.
<LI>The ex HUD director, Kemp,,, he's a moderate, and he's able to work with both sides of the isle in both houses of congress
<LI><img src="http://www.rahul.net/browne/hb-but.gif">
<LI>Harry Browne---a libertarian with a backbone to do what it right and obey the Constitution.
<LI>A CONSERVITIVE 
<LI>I would like to see Harry Browne for president: the less intrusive the gov't, the better
<LI>Harry Browne- he is the only candidate who WILL return power to States and the US to the Constitution
<LI>Colin Powell, because I agree with most of his issues, and Dole and Clinton are a bunch of jokers!
<LI>Graham  He will balance the budget and reduce government.
<LI>Alan Keyes.  Rejection of God & Constitution is root evil
<LI>Harry Browne to CUT government.
<LI>Someone who will reverse the trend toward bigger government.
<LI>Question invalidates a meaningful answer
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Harry Browne.  He (mostly) agrees with what I think.
<LI>Harry Browne, nether traditional party is able to inact change for the good of the country. We need someone who is not in the political mainstream who wishes to reduce government and not just remain elected.
<LI>Bill Clinton because he is better than Bob Dole
<LI>POWELL NEW MAN
<LI>Anybody but Harry Browne! He sucks!
<LI>Harry Browne.  As a Libertarian, he believes in TRUE freedom.
<LI>Harry Browne - To reduce the size and scope of gov't
<LI>Harry Browne.  As a Libertarian, he believes in TRUE freedom.
<LI>Harry Browne because government at all levels is WAY TOO BIG!
<LI>Harry Browne, because I want government out of my personal life and I hate paying so much in taxes! I believe a REVOLUTION is coming if drastic changes are not made immediately.
<LI>Lowell Weicker  Only true independent out there
<LI>Unsure.  No one reflects my views closely enough.
<LI>Alan Keyes.  He is the only moral one in the bunch.
<LI>Harry Browne (Libertarian Party) -- the ONLY candidate who is truly committed to reducing the size of government and returning to us the personal and economic freedoms that an increasingly intrusive and wasteful government has taken away.    
<LI>Phil Gramm. He reflects my view closer than any other candidate.
<LI>Gramm. Most true to his convictions and capible of winning
<LI>Harry Browne: No-nonsense budget control
<LI>Harry Browne, to get government out of our lives
<LI>Steve Forbes--I think the country needs a shrewd Business Man to get their fiscal house in order, and their nose out of everyone's affairs.
<LI>Although I can't say I have been thrilled with his performance, I would have to say Bill Clinton.  It is a measure of how crazy, hateful and exclusive the Republican Party has become that Clinton would be preferable to any of their candidates.
<LI>Harry Browne, reason: The Constitution
<LI>Avoid righteous righters
<LI>Harry Browne because of his positions on the size of government and personal liberty.
<LI>HARRY BROWNE, NO ACTION BY GOV'T CAN IMPROVE ANYONE'S LIFE
<LI>Perot, he's the man
<LI>HARRY BROWNE  CAN MAKE THINGS WORK BY LETTING THE STATES TAKE OVER  OVER SOME OF THE GOVERMENT PROGRAMMS AND LETTING THE FBI  OVER LOOK THEM FOR CORRUPTION
<LI>Would really like to see a PRO-CHOICE Republican; otherwise anybody but Bill!!
<LI>Harry Browne because he's the only candidate that will cut government the most and fastest.
<LI>Harry Browne - There is no point in as much government as we have now!
<LI>Harry Browne; because he will reduce the size of government
<LI>Harry Browne - he will actually reduce the size of gov't.
<LI>Harry Browne - Someone has to change the course of our Government before it kills us and I strongly feel Mr. Browne is the ONLY person who can do it!!
<LI>Bill Clinton, because he is problem the only Democrat that has a good chance of beating Dole and that a Republican in the White House would olny mean too much to the Republicans. I think they are going to far with their plans. 
<LI>Alan Keyes, because he has the same VALUES AND MORALS that I do.
<LI>Harry Browne - - only candidate who supports a clear and meaningful program to return to our Constitutional basis.
<LI>Alan Keyes because he understands the root problems of our society
<LI>I would like to see Bob Dole, or Newt. Definatley not Clinton.
<LI>Bill Clinton is all that stands before us and Newt's warped view of America.
<LI>Bill Gates, because he already own the country.
<LI>Steve Forbes, he is the most pro-economic candidat so fare.
<LI>Clinton
<LI>Browne-to return this country to being the republic it was meant to be, rather than the fascist empire it has become today. To reestablish the liberty of its citizens as the only concern of government. To restrict government to the function of only protecting life and property from violent violation and fraud.
<LI>PEROT
<LI>Harry Browne, Only serious choice for freedom
<LI>Gramm - He won't make deals with the liberals like Dole will
<LI>Alan Keyes sees the issues clearly from a firm base of correct principles.  He demonstates an understanding of the political/moral principles that made this nation great.  He is courageous in espousing those principles.
<LI>someone other than a demo-publican, we need change.
<LI>My first choice is Harry Browne, second is Steve Forbes.  Both seem committed to a reduction in the size and cost of government, and in the intrusiveness of the government in people's lives.
<LI>Alan Keyes.  He is one of the few candidates who has an actual stand on the issues.  I tend toward Libertarian, but their stand on abortion is wrong.  Alan Keyes is the pro-life, pro-family, Libertarian, in my eyes.  He has the guts to say and stick to what he believes, and he has core beliefs which guide his decision-making, he doesn't put a finger to the wind.
<LI>Harry Browne - return to smaller, constitutional government 
<LI>Harry Browne because he will really cut government accross the board.
<LI>Anyone who trusts and empowers individuals, rather thatn attacking us.  Clintons need not apply.
<LI>Bill Clinton. He says what I want to hear.
<LI>Ross Perot - someone with <proven> fiscal responsibility & good business management skills
<LI>Dole, he is the best of the candidates, not necessarily a great candidate, just the cream of a not so impressive crop
<LI>Lamar Alexander
<LI>Bill Clinton, because he at least mouths support for the envirionment, education, and vital social programs, while still advocating welfare reform and strong foriegn policy.
<LI>Steve Forbes. He's a businessman. We are a capitalist country--lets make a profit!
<LI>Bill Clinton because he's partial.
<LI>Clinton, For the most part, I agree with his actions so far.
<LI>????
<LI>Bill Clinton.  He's done the job.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he would dramatically reduce government.
<LI>BOB DORNAN:He stands for the rights of the individual.
<LI>Clinton deserves another term - he's been very unfairly treated by the big-business dominated media.
<LI>Newt Gingrich because he would keep the net from censorship
<LI>PETE WILSON, HE'S A GOOD GUY
<LI>Powell
<LI>Harry Browne-He has character and believes in no government
<LI>HArry Browne. Less Government
<LI>Bob Dole because he is not Bill Clinton
<LI>Anyone who presents a realistic (i.e. Perot doesn't count) alternative to the major parties
<LI>Bill Clinton, because he's for health care.
<LI>HARRY BROWNE - REDUCE GOVERNMENT
<LI>Alan Keyes - he is the only candidate to knows what the problem is, never mind the answer
<LI><center><h1>Harry Browne</h1><img src=/www.rahul.net/browne/hb-but.gif></H1> </CENTER>
<LI>If powell were running I would love to see him in office, that however will not happen.  I also think that Clinton although critized is doing a fine job, and within time he will make good on all of his promises
<LI>Harry Browne  We to completely restructure,reduce fed gov
<LI>Bill Clinton because he's done as much as he could despite the Fascists in Congress.
<LI>Phill Gramm, only man with convictions in the race
<LI>Harry Browne, he will reduce the size of goverment.
<LI>Clinton, because, although flawed, he seems like the only candidate who generally cares about the average citizen and not just the pocket books of the wealthy.
<LI>Harry Browne - to return us to a nation of individual responsibility, with a principled and consistent defense of individual rights, including the right to property.
<LI>Clinton because he works hard and deserves another term
<LI>Of anyone who has a chance at getting their party's nomination, I like Browne the best.
<LI>I want to see Clinton reelected for president in 1996 because he has done a great job so far.
<LI>Arlen Spector
<LI>Harry Browne, I feel that he can set the right example for politicians in that he has a political position (which reflects my own more than any other candidate) that does not change to fit public opinion in order for him to be elected.  His stance on free
<LI>Alan Keyes - He's the only one who stands for what he believes because he believes it's right, rather than watching the poles.
<LI>Lowell Weicker-most independent, straight ahead guy in field
<LI>I would like to see President Clinton re-elected in the coming year.  In his presidency this country has seen the deficit fall and the economy rise.  The NYSE broke the 4000 and 5000 mark this year alone.  Clinton has also made a legitimate attempt to repair this country's broken health care system.  
<LI>Collin Powell: strong leadership qualities; can unify public
<LI>William f buckley.  He is sincere, has character, and is knowledgeable enough for the job.
<LI>Harry Browne- He is not a politician. read his new book "Why Government Doesn't Work"!!
<LI>Someone Who Can Take Moral Leadership
<LI>Pat Buchanan
<LI>BOB DOLE HIS BELIEFS AND EXPERIENCES
<LI>Keyes, because he articulates the ~real~ problems that we face in this country, and points to the best ways to change our current situation.  And because he's black, our country, and our black citizens need someone other than OJ Simpson and Rodney King as standard bearers.
<LI>Harry Browne - apparently the only one who has read the US Constitution.
<LI>Alan Keyes - knows the REAL issues
<LI>Bob Dornan -- common sense values
<LI>Forbes because is a true outsider
<LI>Keyes, Because he stands for the truth and what I stand for.
<LI>AL GORE! WE NEED MORE DEMOCRATS, AND AL HAS HELPED THE NET! 
<LI>Keyes speaks from his internal beliefs.  He knows what he stands for and isn't trying to play to polls.
<LI>Any Libertarian, or like-minded individual.  Why?  Government needs to get out of the business of trying to be everything for everyone.
<LI>Alan Keyes; he speaks the truth and needs no notes to tell him what the truth is.
<LI>Steve Forbes,  He will do the most for changing the attitude of america back to one of self reliance and being responsible.  We shouldn't punish ambition and rewaqrd sloth!
<LI>Alan Keyes : Because were facing moral issues
<LI>Someone smarter in the money world that the plitical world
<LI>Dole-Intelligent,logical,good morales. Represents my views   
<LI>Bill Clinton.  He has made me believe in America and myself.
<LI>Phill Gramm or Harry Browne.  Cut spending lower taxes balance the federal budget and retire the entire national debt.
<LI>Alan Keyes is the man best suited to lead the nation towards its individualist roots.
<LI>Alan Keyes.  He is the only candidate basing his candidacy on moral conduct and the Declaration of Independence.  These are the founding principles of this country.  In addition his character is impeccable and he will honor his word.  Something foreign to the current President.
<LI>Akan Keyes: he could unite the races, he is right about all the issues of concern to me; he's actually intelligent, not just a clever politician.
<LI>Alan Keyes, because he is a man of integrity and principles and understands the root causes of our nation's problems.
<LI>Alan Keyes--He stands for all the moral issues of the day, which our country was founded on.
<LI>Pat Buchanan because he is the ONLY one (besides Charles Collins) who stands against the New World Order & other global crap - & understands the Constitutional limitations upon government
<LI>He isn't running, but I'd like to see Newt as president because he has the most agressive approch to slashing the size of the Federal government.  The feds take plenty from me and give little in return.  The damn hippy generation baby boomers wrecked the county. They and there president try to cover for it by barrowing againt my now meager earnings.  They retire with fat social security and welfare welfare lazy losers and I get nothing but a huge bill and a dim future.
<LI>Alan Keyes, for he addresses the moral problems at the root of our society's problems.
<LI>LAMAR ALEXANER!  He has the energy and knowledge to lead this country.  He has executive experience.
<LI>Alan Keyes because of his position on abortion and other issues
<LI>Alan Keyes - Pro Life, Pro Defense, Christian, Wants turn around of the obvious moral decay.
<LI>Alan Keyes - articulate and persuasive of moral dimension

<LI>I am reminded of the movie "Brewster's Millions...Vote None of the Above!
<LI>Harry Browne ! Reduce government now !
<LI>Alan Keyes: Because he best represents my values
<LI>DR. ALAN KEYES--He is the only candidate who is willing to take a stand on the moral problems of our great country, all of which lead to the "practical" problems (welfare, education, crime, etc.) There is no sense in trying to fix these matters unless the root cause of them is fixed as well. Dr. Keyes is the ONLY candidate with incredible foreign policy experience (ambassador) and a great deal of fiscal experience as president of Citizens Against Government Waste. Not to mention his fine oratory skills

<LI>Alan Keyes because he is the only candidate who understands and expresses this nation's real needs 
<LI>Jerry Brown, flat tax rate, 'nuff said.

<LI>Harry Browne. He's the only one that's serious about reducing the size of governement and restoring liberty to,the people of this country.
<LI>Alan Keyes  Only person I totally agree with!
<LI>Alan Keyes reflects my deepest feelings and concerns
<LI>Any of the Republicans, because when they move their lips there is no indication of lying.
<LI>someone who stands for himself, not a party
<LI>Alan Keyes -- I identify most closely with his ideology.  He understands economics, foreign policy (fmr ambassador) and has values matching my own
<LI>Keyes in 96. although many don't want to admit it, he's the most libertarian candidate in the 2 major parties.
<LI>Alan Keyes because his message focuses on the root cause of many of our societal ills, the breakdown of the family and the attempt to rid the US of any religious influence.
<LI>Alan Keyes as he most accurately articulates my beliefs
<LI>Alan Keyes - He has the most moral integrity and can be a great leader.
<LI>Alan Keyes, or Pat Buchanan, as they represent (and can articulate) conservative values most clearly and consistently.
<LI>Alan Keyes  - because he is the only one running that represents me
<LI>Alan Keyes; he is the only candidate with sufficient conviction.
<LI>Alan Keyes, only candidate understanding that ours is a moral problem not a fiscal problem.
<LI>Alan Keyes; Character matters
<LI>Alan Keyes.  He is, IMHO, the ONLY candidate with the courage of his convictions, a commitment to the family as the centeral governing unit in society, and yet posessing the skill to govern the nation.

<LI>keyes, because he emphasizes morality
<LI>Alan Keyes- Because his vision for changing America is based on restoring the moral values of US citizens, if moral values are right then all other issues come in line.
<LI>keyes because we need an outsider
<LI>Colin Powell - Moderate in his programs and direction.
<LI>No current candidates seem good to me... could we get some volunteers from Israel, maybe? I want a president who can speak English.
<LI>Alan Keyes- HE CAN BEAT BILL CLINTON!
<LI>Harry Browne.  He will make the country truly "free".
<LI>Christina Todd Whitman She's tough, she's fair, she's more moderate
<LI>Harry Browne.  Finally a leader who would follow through on what he says and return the country to its Constitutional limits.
<LI>Colin Powell-he has a lot of the same viewpoints as me.
<LI>So far I would like to see Bill Clinton re-elected as president.  Although fiscally I am conservative, I think that a Republican Congress will make up for a Democratic President.  Also, I think that Clinton will be less likely to legislate personal religious values.  I tend to think along a libertarian bent, but the Libertarian party is too lax  on some issues that I feel require legislation, such as protecting the environment.
<LI>Harry browne, because he will give us less government--and I want a hell of alot less government.
<LI>John Engler (Mich. governor); he is only politician currently in office who has actually eliminated an entire type of taxation (property taxes)
<LI>nj
<LI>Clinton has done a good job pleasing a majority of the people and only the closed-minded refuse to see the positive effect Clinton has made on this country
<LI>Pat Buchanan, only blue-collar American running
<LI>Jack Kemp
<LI>Colin Powell.  How the hell should I know?
<LI>Bob Dole - To bring a sense of unity to the Federal Gov't.
<LI>Harry Browne is the only choice if we want to restore freedom to this country.  We NEED a balanced budget, spending cuts, and downsizing/privatizing of government in order to survive as a country.  Harry Browne is the only logical choice.
<LI>Dan Quayle:  He deserves it more than Clinton
<LI>Harry Browne, because Government is the embodiment of evil
<LI>Harry Browne - He stands for maximum individual freedom and limited constitutional government
<LI>Harry Browne, because he's the only honest man running.
<LI>I wish all the damn colonists would go home.  There is no room for us natives anymore...  Go home whitey...
<LI>Bill Clinton to offset the right leaning Republican Congress
<LI>Bob Dole, experience, military service, not a draft dodger, good relations with congress
<LI>Harry Browne.  He's the only credible candidate who will actually reduce government.
<LI>Bill Clinton,to continue the work he has started.
<LI>Browne: Government needs to be trimmed if it is to be healthy.
<LI>someone who's honest, and has firm beliefs
<LI>Harry Browne. No one else will reduce government size enough.
<LI>Bob Dornan I feel that he can provide the leadership that Clinton has so badly lacked.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is the only one advocating a dramatic reduction in government.
<LI>My father.  He's uncorruptable and won't listen to special interest groups (which is why he'd never be president).
<LI>Browne.  Because he is the best shot at reducing government.
<LI>Pat Robertson - This country needs more religous influence
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate with an actual political philosophy.  The main two parties are more concerned with contradicting the other and have few underlying principles.
<LI>Mario Cuomo, because he is able to articulate his ideas well and has the right experience to lead.
<LI>Any who will cut cut cut cut cut everwhere and everthing
<LI>Harry Browne - because govt needs to be reduced dramatically
<LI>James Baker or Richard Cheney - Honest, Capable, Experienced
<LI>Clinton; he's actually a middle of the roader, thus better able to represent the majority
<LI>bill clinton.  his perspective on issues closely resembles mine.
<LI>Powell, but without him around, Clinton because he is intelligent, moderate and hard-working.
<LI>Somebody competent, says what they mean, not a vague PR-driven candidate.
<LI>Colin Powell - No extreme views - It's a gray world, not black and white
<LI>Harry Browne; Because he can be trusted to do what he says he will do.
<LI>Anybody to keep the Newt in check
<LI>Bill Clinton- he has good ideas and is open to change even though he waffles to much; besides he is the lesser of all evils.
<LI>Harry Browne, because government doesn't work
<LI>Harry Browne--end immoral government force
<LI>anyone but Bill Clinton
<LI>Bill Clinton--I am not happy with the other candidates!
<LI>Harry Browne - only honest one of them!
<LI>Harry Browne - supporter of individul freedom & property rghts
<LI>Harry Browne; he is the only candidate who can articlulate "Why Government Doesn't Work."
<LI>Newt or Dole or Buchanan.  Just once- I'd like to see a republican president and congress!  Let's just try it!  It can't get worse!!
<LI>Harry Browne or another Libertarian to get back to our roots
<LI>harry browne--wants to end the "war on drugs"
<LI>Bill Clinton - Because he's the best choice we have. At best he'll do something to limit the influence of big business in America and at worst he won't be a far right conservative preaching supply side economics
<LI>Harry Browne. It's time to send the Dems and Reps home.
<LI>Steve Forbes looks like the best candidate who has a chance to make it on the ballot in 96. Harry Browne is a Conservative whacko in Libertarian clothing.
<LI>I'm totally undecided as of yet
<LI>Harry Browne. He is the only person that has the courage and the will to drastically downsize our runaway federal steamroller.
<LI>clinton-his proposed policies are more intune with the public than any republican agenda-especially regarding healthcare, welfare, and defense spending.
<LI>Harry Browne- only candidate with a rational long-term focus
<LI>Clinton -- despite all the "news" to the contrary -- is doing a good job under very difficult circumstances.
<LI>Harry Browne. Browne has proposed specific policies for cutting government that are practical and workable and not just rhetorical.
<LI>Alan Keyes, his priorities match my own (restore the family!)
<LI>Harry Browne - the only man who truly wants to reduce government
<LI>Dole
<LI>Anybody but clinton
<LI>BOB DOLE I THINK HE IS A GOOD LEADER.
<LI>Pat Buchanan
<LI>Harry Browne -- Reduce the size of the federal governemnt
<LI>My dog
<LI>Phil Gramm.  He best exemplifies integrity, leadership, and fiscal conservatism.
<LI>Bill C, the only democrat with a chance to stand up against the republicans.
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate who can deliver freedom for all citizens.
<LI>Harry Browne -- only one who really wants to cut government
<LI>Jerry Brown

<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_PREZ -->
<LI>Harry Browne - while we still can
<LI>Harry Browne-- I don't like the other 2 'choices'
<LI>Clinton - He's not an angel - in fact, he's rather shady, but Dole offers no real alternative, and no real solutions to problems either. In my opinion, unless a bold third party alternative arises, we may as well remain with Clinton for the next four years, and then prevent Al Gore from becoming President in 2000. We can look for a new leader in four years. A real leader.
<LI>Colin Powell -- I agree with his stands on the affirmative action and abortion issues; I am impressed with his leadership capabilities.
<LI>Dole - Clinton morally unfit
<LI>bob dole because he is the best qualified for the job
<LI>Harry Browne. Keep the gov't out of the boardroom *and* the bedroom.
<LI>Harry Browne ... Because he wants to reduce just about everything in Gov't ... and believes in personal responsibility ... free market economy ... 
<LI>Harry Browne, to reduce government interference in markets and lifestyles
<LI>president Clinton because even though I dont always agree with what he is doing or his views I believe he is really trying to help this country out. Dole  is out of touch with the common man, and the common mans real life concerns.  
<LI>Bob Dole- Only because I feel that I can trust him.
<LI>Browne
<LI>Bob Dole, a mature proven leader
<LI>Gen. Colin Powell
<LI>Sadly, there are no nore heroes.
<LI>BOB DOLE; HE'S THE ONLY ONE LEFT WHO HAS A CHANCE OF BEATING BILL!
<LI>Bill Bradley, because I believe someone willing to lead without support from the Republicrats will have a better chance of restoring the people's trust in their government.
<LI>A Republican
<LI>Dole - The important thing is to get rid of Clinton.
<LI>Harry Browne or anyone who will support a free society
<LI>Bob Dole. He is the most likely man to use his abilities to influence abolishing the income tax system and replace it with a national consumption tax that is honestly fair. 
<LI>Harry Browne wants to reduce (make smaller) the government, not reduce (not enlarge to as much as it was going to) the government.
<LI>Don't know because all present choices are depressing!!
<LI>Pat Buchanan, intelligent - stands for his principles.
<LI>Harry Browne, because the larger government gets the more money and freedom are taken away from the individual
<LI>dole; clinton has no moral standing and no credibility and is way tooooo liberal
<LI>Harry Browne, but it won't happen
<LI>not clinton
<LI>Harry Browne. Only candidate that promises to significantly reduce the size of government/taxes.
<LI>Harry Browne, Big Government is at the heart of most of this country's problems.
<LI>HARRY BROWNE-THE DEMS DON'T REDUCE THE SIZE OR SCOPE OF COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, COERCIVE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS
<LI>Dole.  So the conservative congress can bring respect back to our government.
<LI>Colin Powell - I think he is not as corruptable as the other candidates
<LI>Bill Clinton.  The econony is great and we're at peace
<LI>Ross Perot - He is intelligent, caring and has his priorities straight (i.e., the national debt)
<LI>Bill Clinton has a heart and given a choice between people and business he will pick people.
<LI>Harry Browne-so he can reduce the government size.
<LI>Bill Clinton
<LI>Harry Browne, because he wants to reform government so that it functions within its originally-intended, Constitutional boundaries
<LI>Pat Buchanan
<LI>I will vote for Bob Dole.  Battle experience, military and governmental.  I believe the Clinton's show little regard for Law.  They have a deeper involvement in Whitewater than has been uncovered thus far.  He is violating it again by his all out assault on the BRAC on closing  2 AF Logistics Centers, because they are in Texas and California, the two biggest electorates.  He is trying to redefine the 60/40 rule of core workload, he is shoving his Acquisition Reform Initiative down our throats, jeopardi
ing national security.  As a President, I find Clinton shallow.
<LI>Ralph Nader, because he is the only candidate who is at the same time honest and compassionate
<LI>I think they all are pretty much useless. Personally, I think Leslie Fish (the musician) would be good. She's very radical, but she'd certainly liven things up!
<LI>anybody but the clintons
<LI>bob dole , i,m embarrassed to have bill clinton as president
<LI>Bill Clinton: because he is intelligent, he understands the common person, he genuinely deals with the issues, he has shown the ability to compromise, he loves his job, the country needs a moderating force against the extreme right wing.
<LI>Harry Browne; offers the opportunity to make some real change and disrupt the 'status-quo.'
<LI>I feel that Bob Dole would be the only clear choice since Bill Clinton seems to be involved in one stupidity after another.  Even if he is not guilty of any wrongdoing, he is, at best, very stupid.
<LI>Browne
<LI>Harry Browne is everything I could want in a candidate.  Period.
<LI>Bob Dole, you can trust him
<LI>Clinton, because Dole will have a heart-attack if he wins
<LI>Bill Clinton....Best and ONLY choice.
<LI>Probably Bill Clinton because he's grew up poor and he's not too old, so he's more in touch with (my) reality than the others.
<LI>Bob Dole/C. Powell It is time to bring back honesty to the White House and end this embarrassment!
<LI>Ron Paul- Ideology and character
<LI>clinton
<LI>Ralph Nader, who is actually honorable
<LI>Bill Clinton,  he has done an effective job.
<LI>Buchanan:  He has the greatest resolve in the face of overwhelming odds.
<LI>I just can't see four more years of either the "demoncrats" of the "Repopublicans." But thanks the the national media most folks will mistakenly believe that these losers are their only choice.
<LI>BILL CLINTON
<LI>Ralph Nader
<LI>Dole-Strong integrity, military service, wise, honest.
<LI>Clinton - no better choice available at this time.  Gingrich could have done it but he turned into nothing but blubber.
<LI>Bob Dole, to get rid of Clinton and his media mafia
<LI>Harry Browne - a flat tax of zero%, return to Constitution
<LI>Buchanan, he is for keeping America FREE, Prospurous, & Soverign, unlike the rest wich are just a bunch of Communists!!
<LI>sure bob dole, just because he is a make sense people.
<LI>I believe Bob Dole has the character and intestinal fortitude to reduce our debts and allow the country to boom as never before.
<LI>Harry Browne...He's the best logical choice
<LI>Harry Browne; the only candidate with revolutionary , credible ideas.
<LI>Harry Browne is the only major candidate for less government.
<LI>Bill Clinton.  He has proven to be a stable, reasonable person, with a few mistakes: NAFTA, Gays in the military idea, but he has done almost everything else right.
<LI>Harry Browne. I no longer trust either of the two major parties.
<LI>Ralph Nader
<LI>Gen.Powell   educated/military background/strong figure
<LI>Harry Browne so that my children might someday live in a free country.
<LI>Phil gramm
<LI>BOB DOLE
<LI>Harry Browne  It's time to try a president who's heard of the US Constitution.
<LI>Harry Browne.  The Democrats and Republicans are two factions of the Government Party, Ross Perot's Reform Party is an exercise in mush-minded centrism, and it's time to see what the Libertarians could do.  If the Republicans can't even kill off a useless department such as the Department of Education, or cut off the corporate welfare through the likes of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, then it's pretty obvious that they aren't serious about really reducing the Federal government.  Go, Har
y, Go!!! 
<LI>At this point, I would select Clinton because I don't trust Dole to address the needs of the average American.  Plus, Clinton has performed resaonably well.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he has the only credible plan which would drastically reduce the size, scope, and cost of the Federal government.
<LI>Harry Browne -- We need a smaller, less expensive, and less intrusive federal government.
<LI>Clinton, of course, because he's unquestionably the Greatest President of the Twentieth Century!
<LI>Dole
<LI>Bob Dole  This country cannot withstand another four years of the current disaster in the White House.
<LI>Bob Dole, because he is more qualifed than Bill 
<LI>James 쓕o Gritz.  He was blocked out by the news media & our government when he ran against Clinton in the past.  Hello to Big Brother and his peeping-tom agents ...;)
<LI>Clinton because he's a great president.
<LI>Bill Clinton. Although he is too conservative for me I feel that he is honest, open and projects family values. Unlike Bob Dole he cared enough about his marriage to work it out. I would find it impossible to believe that Clinton would abandoned Chelsea the way Dole nad Newt abondned their children and wives.
<LI>Harry Browne, to restore personal rights & responsibility
<LI>Ross Perot has the ideas to get the job done on the national debt.
<LI>harry browne- I'm afan of liberty 
<LI>Dole, he can only be better than what we've seen the last 4 years.
<LI>Clinton because he is doing a good job and is better than any alternative the Republicans can produce.
<LI>Pat Buchanon;  Because I appreciate his strong Pro-Life Stance, our nation cannot have a strong moral base if we continue allow unborn babies to be murdered.  Also I appreciate the fact that Pat is not bought and paid for by the Archer Daniel Midlands and other huge corporations as Bob Dole and Bill Clinton are.  When I see a candidate being attacked by the media and Party Establisment officials then it reassures me of my judgement or tells me I need to take another look.  If the choice came down to Do
e & Clinton I would have a dilemna - I really want Clinton out, but I believe I would probably write in my pastor's name b4 I would vote for a candidate that is not convincingly Pro-Life.
<LI>At this point it's Bob Dole.  He has a Characteristic you didn't list.  He is honest and not a quibbler like Clinton and his group.  I am tired of "failed memories" and precisely worded answers designed to gove deceiving impressions!
<LI>harry browne -- eliminate the political games
<LI>Dole, because we need a balance budget that focusing on slowing the growth of entitilement programs
<LI>BOB DOLE,   ONLY ONE LEFT TO VOTE FOR
<LI>Pat Buchanan -- Because I believe he'll represent the american people and U.S.A's best interests
<LI>Harry Browne because he would get the Federal Government out of many things it has no business being involved in.
<LI>Colin Powell. We need a man with morals and character.
<LI>Clinton... At this time there is NO one else!
<LI>Dole.  While no politician is completely honest, I feel he would be much more honest then Clinton.
<LI>Pete Wilson because he represents the majority view points of Americans on most issues - abortion, immigration, affirmative action, the deficit
<LI>Ralph Nader
<LI>Bob Dole because he sounds like a pineapple.
<LI>Bill Clinton,because I think he would be a better person than the other candidates.
<LI>Harry Browne to reduce Fed.Gov. to Constitutional level.
<LI>Pat Buchanan because he is uncompromising on where he stands on issues.
<LI>harry browne,i beleive his views on our government or true and up to date
<LI>Harry Brown.  Only he will give us less governmet, less taxes and more freedom.
<LI>Bill Clinton--because he's right on the things I care about most deeply.  He seeks to bring us together, not divide us.  
<LI>Someone with common sense who will not lie to me 
<LI>Pat Paulsen. He's a heavy drug user, and that's cool.
<LI>Harry Browne. The LP is the only party which professes a philosophy that I believe in.
<LI>Harry Browne, who we can trust to cut govt & taxes.
<LI>Harry Browne - Would work for a much smaller Federal Government
<LI>Harry Browne due to the fact that the government that governs least governs best
<LI>Bob Dole because I don't think anyone else can beat Clinton and I would rather see anyone but Clinton as my president again.
<LI>Ross Perot: Intelligent, Honest, Dedicated - a true leader
<LI>So far Ralph Nader looks the best
<LI>I would like to someone who has the best plan for education.  Belonging to "generation X" and heading off to college, I would like to see a canidate who has a plan that could make college more affordable.  I am not happy with any of the canidates, but I would like Clinto to win.  Things are fine the way they are now.
<LI>Buchanan...He's for America first, against New world Order!
<LI>Harry Browne.  Out of all the field of candidates, he is the only one who recognizes that democracy exists for a pupose: to ensure liberty.  In my mind he is the only candidate who is faithful to the vision of the founders of the country, and the only who would enact their revolutionary plan of government, which despite 200 years of democracy has never really been carried out anywhere in the world.  I am especially attracted to his call for an end to the war on drugs and government intrusion into the c
lture and habits of the people.  I think the War on Drugs has not only in priciple been morally wrong, but has also had disastrous economic, social, and criminal side effects.  I am also especially attracted to his non-interventionist foreign policy views.
<LI>Bill Clinton.  He is more in touch with what is happening today
<LI>I believe that Mr. Clinton is the candidate with his eye on the future and will be the safest choice for America
<LI>Harry Browne, he is the best man running.
<LI>Bob Dole because he represents most of the ideas I believe are good for america.
<LI>Harry Browne, Because he swears to end "the war on drugs" and legalize cannabis. 
<LI>Harry Browne, the only truthful person running.  Less Gvt now and an end to abusive & unconstitutional gvt. such as IRS FDA BATF IRS EPA NEA Fed Education. More freedom for all Americans!!!
<LI>Bob Dole because he is the most honest/experienced candidate
<LI>Snoopy could run the country better than any of the clowns currently running. And that's considering the fact that Snoopy is only a cartoon and a plush animal.
<LI>Bob Dole, because he has demonstrated clear leadership, and honest conduct, even n the face of adversity
<LI>Bob Dole, because I want to see a balanced budget amendment
<LI>Bob Dole - Because he has my respect as a leader!
<LI>Bill Clinton. He has us on the right road to economical recovery and could amaze us with good Congressional support
<LI>Harry Browne - as he is the only candidate with strong principles and positions
<LI>Dole.  Clinton has serious character flaws and very little leadership ability.  In my opinion, he is running the most ethically corrupt white house ever.
<LI>Browne is the only one of the big players who isn't a politician--that means that he's got a head on his shoulders.
<LI>Harry Browne. He will do what he says.
<LI>Harry Browne- He's the only candidate who will reduce government
<LI>Bob Dole.  Have lost all trust in the White House and those who support them.
<LI>Harry Browne, The Federal Govt. must be reduced to a tiny fraction of what it is now, and Harry and his party are the ones who would do it, not just blow hot air about it like the asses and elephants. Corruption WILL be exposed.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he would actually reduce government.
<LI>Harry Browne -- because I want LESS GOVERNMENT.  Youth Against Facism.
<LI>dole
<LI>Dole, Honest,Trustworthy, more apt to reduce government
<LI>James "Bo" Gritz !  He was blacked out by the media and the government when he first ran against Clinton.  Hello again to all my buddies working for Big BROTHER ... :)
<LI>Less Government
<LI>Ralph Nader.  He is the only honest man running, and you blacked him out just like the rest of the commercial media.  Shame on you.
<LI>Robert Dole because he seems to be a moderate and can work with Congress well.
<LI>Dole, less government, higher standards, morality
<LI>Bob Dole. He has Charactor. He does have belifes. Bill clinton just says what you want to hear. Bob Dole has not hate mongered, scared children and Sesoned citizens. Bob dole does not lie!
<LI>Bob Dole. Is for giving power back to the states.
<LI>BIll Clinton because I think that he has been fair to the people of our country.
<LI>Harry Browne.  Taxes and regulation are way too high.  War on Drugs has to end before we lose all our freedoms and prosperity.
<LI>Clinton. Dole is just too conservative
<LI>Bob Dole, can work w/ Newt to advance the Republican agenda
<LI>george bush!
<LI>Clinton, a moderate who understands the working person's problems,and will address them.
<LI>Ronald Reagan
<LI>Dole - Honest & knows the ins & outs of Washington
<LI>Harry Browne because he most represents the libertarian philosphy that "the actions of all people should be voluntarly".
<LI>Bob Dole, because he has shown himself to be an honorable person and seems to be able to forge workable solutions to complex political problems. I believe that President Clinton has failed to exercise the leadership role that is the nature of being President. He seems to believe what the latest poll tells him people want him to believe. This accounts for the dizzying rate at which his positions change. Clinton seems to be more interested in the appearance of adopting a position rather than the substanc
 of the position. For example, proclaiming his support for the Wisconsin Welfare reform Model and then failing to implement any of the elements of the reform in policy. All he wants to do is be able to tell people " I support that " when I don't believe he does. 
<LI>bob dole. He is a true man of character, with military experence, politicol experience, and is trustworthy.
<LI>Al Gore
<LI>Ralph Nader
<LI>A Libertarian - the only ones serious about smaller goverment
<LI>Bill Clinton deserves a second terma because he is the candidate that better represents most of American citizens and who has a foreing policy based on liberal democracy.
<LI>Buchanan - has the most moral character and real solutions of any other candidate and is consistant in his views.
<LI>Harry Browne; ideals of Libertarian party most closely match my own
<LI>Harry Browne- No Censorship/Taxes
<LI>Pat Buchanan, he's the ONLY PRO-America candidate!
<LI>dole--not clinton for the following reason --clinton cant stand by a decision for more than one day---he is the only president in history to be sued for sexually harrassment---only president who will allow his wife to belittle him in front of his staff--the only president that dodged the draft- allowed Janet Reno to send in a tank against a houseful of people--hired a surgeon general that told school kids that they needed to learn the art of masturbation --increased my taxes--- only president in histor
 to have his best friend commit suicide---the only president in history to have a vast majority of his best friends convicted on felonys or about to be investigated on felonies===I could go on about clintons lack of character but my arm is getting tired ---i'll just quote my husband --If we re-elect clinton America will get what it deserves
<LI>There are only two choices.  Be practical--Dole or Clinton.  I vote for Dole.  Now, if there were other realistic choices, maybe this question would mean more.  Be realistic.
<LI>Government Doesn't Work.
<LI>Bob Dole.  Because the democratic party has a consideral amount of lying bastards that really don't give a fuck about the country as a whole.
<LI>Bob Dole - so that the Balanced Budget Admendment to the Constitution gets passed.  This country is going broke!!!!!
<LI>George Bush; He was a great president and I believe he could have gotten the country on the right track had he been reelected
<LI>Harry Browne, we need to reverse the growth of the federal government not just slow the rate of growth.
<LI>Harry Browne.  Government is stifling creativity, personal freedom and self responsibility
<LI>Harry Browne. The Republicans have proven that they are not passionate about genuinely and boldly reducing the degree of government intrusion into our social and economic lives.  The Democrats are beyond hope, still in love with the principle of government itntervention in our lives despite the massive failure of the New Deal/Great Society legacy.  Both major parties fear serious reform of Social Security, a disaster waiting to happen.  Ross Perot's primary answer about issues is to say that "We need t
 study it, have our best people look at it" without offering any dynamic propositions of his own; if he wants to be worshipped, he should  start a church, not a political party.
<LI>harry browne he is for less gov. less taxes,more indiv.freedom,an america that was intended by the founding fathers.
<LI>Bob Dole- shift away from socalist influence of Clinton
<LI>Ambassador Alan Keyes - He is the most gifted, articulate, honest candidate for national office that I have seen and heard in my lifetime. An outstanding leader who speaks to the heart of America!
<LI>Bill Clinton
<LI>clinton, peoplr think:better than dole
<LI>Harry Browne because Governement is way too big
<LI>Since Ralph Nader has no chance to win, I'll vote for Clinton.  He'll protect the environment and a woman's right to choose.
<LI>Clinton- The republicans are trying to turn back all the gains made by middle and lower class people resulting from New Deal Legislation.
<LI>Brown, nothing could be better for us than an invisible fed.
<LI>Buchanan. He would stop immigration turning this country into United States of Illegal Immigrants. All but 1 of his ideas make sense. But no one is perfect. Having even 1 flaw is nigh impossible. But he is only bringing in 1 flaw. That puts him in a class with Lincoln, Washington etc.
<LI>Bob Dole because he is honest and for real.
<LI>Buchanan 1st choice. Harry Browne 2nd choice. Less government. More liberty.
<LI>Harry Browne.  The federal government needs to be reduced in both size and intrusion into peoples lives.
<LI>Harry Browne - Small Government
<LI>CLINTON -- he probably won't screw things up too badly.
<LI>James Bo Gritz.  He ran against bill, but the government/media blocked him out!

<LI>Dole
<LI>A leader with moral integrity, wisdom and vision for America
<LI>Bill Clinton because he cares
<LI>Pat Buchanan...he has character and stands for principle of restoring our Republic to a Constitutional form of government  that was originally established by the Founders
<LI>Dole will force a reduction in government via the GOP
<LI>Bill Clinton
<LI>Pat Buchanan because he's a working mans candidate as well as a man of high morals, character and leadership. He's been slandered by the political machine and the media, that proves he's on the right track!
<LI>Buchannan - Christian views
<LI>Bob Dole, because he believes people are smart enough to decide things for themselves, without government assistance.
<LI>Bill Clinton because I believe he has done a great job so far, and he came from a middle class background and understands what real people are concerned about.
<LI>harry browne - gov't does not work
<LI>Harry Browne to SERIOUSLY reduce the cost and intrusiveness of government.
<LI>Make American business build at home will help both economy and the National Debt plus it would get people off welfare, because these would be jobs that appeal to people   
<LI>Harry Browne, I agree with his objectives.
<LI>Bob Dole. Because he is not Clinton.
<LI>george bush jr.    an honest conservitive and capable
<LI>Bill Clinton, becasue he has done a good job
<LI>Harry Browne, because we need to reverse, not slow, the growth of big government which is crippling the nation.
<LI>Harry Browne; none of the other candidates match my views
<LI>Bill Clinton, basically because he has not caused our country to go into further debt.
<LI>Ralf Nader: Someone without a corupt authoratian agenda.
<LI>Perot...because he is human being who makes mistakes, has good ideas, has proven himself to be a good leader, and he is a nut!  Maybe that is what this country needs, someone to turn over the controls and say "hey, this is your country what do YOU want".  besides with the choices we have so far, i am prob. going to go with george carliton on the subject "This country was bought and sold a long time ago, the shit they shuffle around every four years means nothing, the government no longer is FOR the peo
le, I will prob. stay home on election day!"
<LI>Dole- experienced, conservative, honest
<LI>For him to be cool
<LI>Harry Browne - Why Gov't Doesn't Work!
<LI>Harry Browne: We need to follow the constitution.
<LI>of those running Bob Dole
<LI>Bob Dole and Colin Powell because they are both proven leaders.  
<LI>Harry Browne because I believe that if elected, he will actually reduce government.
<LI>Bob Dole. Bill Clinton is useless.
<LI>bob dolen because nhe wants to do away with affirmative action
<LI>anyone who is not running at this time!
<LI>0% Flat tax.  The only way to execute it properly
<LI>Bob Dole -- Strong character, and beleive that most of his positions on different issues are correct -- especially welfare, and balancing the budget.
<LI>Clinton -- best one for the job
<LI>Ralph Nader (Green), to protect our society and environment from corporate control.  WHY isn't he one of the choices above?!?!
<LI>Dole. Clinton can't be trusted to keep any promise he makes
<LI>Dole  -  best for the job with a chance to be elected
<LI>Bill Clinton--stay the course.  Bob Dole is too much of a Washington insider.  "Mr. All-American" with a closetful of skeletons.
<LI>Harry Browne - Liberty is the source of everything we value.
<LI>Dole-anyone but Clinton(no "new" democrat). poll is poor. #2-ambiguous. #12-rank 'em. #11,13,14-poor choices, mine wasn't on the lists 
<LI>any libertarian...too much government intervention in our lives
<LI>Harry Browne He understands what the Federal Government should be about
<LI>Bob Dole...We need someone who won't veto good legislation
<LI>Bob Dole-Sick of feeling Bill's pain as he tells one and all exactly what he thinks they want to hear.
<LI>Bob Dole
<LI>Bob Dole, because Clinton is a crook
<LI>someone/anyone who cares
<LI>Harry Browne - Less government, more freedom, lower taxes
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is Libertarian
<LI>Harry Browne cause he will do what he says he will do. 
<LI>STEVE FORBES because he has not been fooled by the government.
<LI>Bob Dole - He is a man with character, leadership, and honesty.
<LI>Bob Dole
<LI>Honesty, morals, and an anti-drug stance, because I'm tired of the lies and lack of a war on drugs.
<LI>Harry Browne.  He understands the nature of government and why it should be very limited.
<LI>Harry Browne, - a new direction of prosperity
<LI>ross perot because he is not a politian
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Bill Clinton - he will protect us from the tyranny of the gingrich fascists
<LI>Harry Browne.  I want my rights back.
<LI>Browne, Libertarian, because he actually would reduce govt
<LI>Harry Browne, so we can begin the long job of regaining our rights.
<LI>Ronald Reagan-  Why not the best?
<LI>My choice for president is Bob Dole.  I think his record as a WWII hero says quite a bit about the mans character.  He has a positive vision for the future which is consistant with his beliefs.  His views do not change during an election year.   What he says is consistant with what he does.   Bob Dole was the Senate majority leader who helped send:  the first balanced buget in 40 years, welfare reform,  tax cut and many other legislative Acts to the White House.
<LI>PAT BUCHANAN.  HE APPEALS TO ME FOR HIS UNDERSTANDING OF EXACTLY WHAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE AND LIMIT AUTHORITY TO THOSE.
<LI>Bob Dole, only because I think Clinton is a horror!
<LI>Harry Browne.  It's the only way to reduce government.
<LI>Harry Browne  --  Will reduce federal government power.
<LI>any libertarian candidate, with a democrat or republican i only see things worsening
<LI>Somebody with morals and consideration for the poor
<LI>None of the above, but I'll vote for the least of all evils
<LI>Harry Browne need a change from Repulicrats
<LI>Harry Browne - Would actually reduce the size of government
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Bob Dole--- Clinton is the biggest liar in office since Nixon!
<LI>Harry Browne he wants less government and less taxes
<LI>For the sake of America....BOB DOLE.....
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is the only candidate calling for a serious reduction in the size and power of the government.
<LI>Harry Browne - It's time for government to get out of areas it shouldn't be in.
<LI>Dole Talks conservative-Governs conservative
<LI>Dole - principles; common-man, non-relativist morality; international respect and knowledge of international affairs; economics; control of federal government and burdensome regulation; reigning in system, expectations and resentments arising from preferential treatment; maintenance of adequate defense; movement toward proper use of national revenues; etc
<LI>Harry Browne; end intrusive government and the attempt to solve social problems by force; restore individual liberty and responsibility. Only then can we restore America to greatness. Realistically, I think Clinton will win, since the Republican failure to change anything will split the vote and cause many to vote Libertarian/other third party. Much can potentially be gained if the Republicans lose in this manner - as long as they know WHY they lost...
<LI>Bill Clinton has done a credible job and deserves to be returned for a second term.  His approach to issues is level-headed and judicious.  Republicans are dedicated to radical and even reckless policies.
<LI>Bob Dole because I feel he will stand by a moderate-conservative agenda when in office, while I think Clinton is taking conservative stands right now just to be reelected. 
<LI>Bill Clinton- Has been a great leader.
<LI>Harry Browne!  This country NEEDS the changes that Harry Browne proposes!  The gov't. is far to large, intrusive & out of control and has been for far too long.
<LI>Bill Clinton because he has a positive vision for America, cares about average people, and shares my values.
<LI>Bill Clinton, because his ideas are closest to mine.
<LI>President Clinton.  It's the Economy, Stupid, Part II - The longest period of uninterrupted economic growth since George Washington.  Period.  There is no debate on that
<LI>Bob Dole because Clinton is a liar with no moral character
<LI>Bob Dole...a better chance for getting the right things done.
<LI>Bob Dole, for his honesty,says what he means and followss thru 
<LI>Cinton--he is doing a fine job so far, country is moving in right direction
<LI>Beckett and Calavicci in '96: Putting right what once went wrong.
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Harry Browne, because he's the only one who wants to lessen the ever increasing influence of government as portrayed in Orwell's "1984."
<LI>Pat Buchanan.  He puts the interests of the American middle class first.
<LI>Ralph Nader, only person who can be trusted to be looking out for the rights of the many.
<LI>Harry Browne is a gentlemen of principle who has respect for his fellow citizens.
<LI>Pat Buchanan: Pro-Life, Pro-Family, Pro-America
<LI>Harry Browne. Less government, no slavery for the next generation.
<LI>sweeping financial reform and less government
<LI>Harry Browne, I want much less intrusive government.  I want to have my constitutional freedoms restored and not taken away by an overbearing federal government
<LI>pat buchanan his support of job in america and not sending our manufactoring jobs out of the country
<LI>Harry Browne - The ONLY Candidate that will Reduce the size and scope of Gov. & looking for ways to expand Individual Freedom.. 
<LI>Harry Browne, will restore Constitutional govt and dismantle 80%+ of Federal govt and destroy the Federal Reserve criminal conspiracy.
<LI>Harry Browne, Others talk, he WILL reduce the government and resurrect the Constitution.
<LI>Clinton. Best feasible choice. Continue on same path.
<LI>Ralph Nader...enough said
<LI>Ross Perot because his first priority is the well-being of this nation.
<LI>I'm not certain.  However, since I _don't_ want to vote for either of the major party candidates, I'm left to vote my conscience and that leans toward libertarianism; ergo Harry Browne.
<LI>Newt Gingrich Effective leader with good ideas
<LI>Ralph Nader.  He is most likely to work toward preserving environmental integrity
<LI><h3><font color="00A0FF">The Democrats and Republicans are old news.<br>For real alternatives try <a href="http://www.math.princeton.edu/~tpbarber/3pc/">3rd Party Central</a>.</font></h3></A> </H3> </FONT>
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate who is philosophically correct: metaphysically, epistemologically, ethically, esthetically, and politically.  Liberty works.
<LI>Clinton  Had enough of the dishonest republicans
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate who wants to reduce the size of the federal government, not just its rate of growth.
<LI>Bill Clinton. He should continue with the job he's done the past 4 years. He should stand up against the right-wing fanatics in the House.
<LI>Clinton.
<LI>Harry Browne - very much smaller government, taxes, intrustion
<LI>Senator Fred Thompson (R-Tenn)  He has fought to make the unpopular but right changes in congress and he gives a good speech.
<LI>health care regulated for all participants
<LI>Clinton, all other choices are worse but his record on gay issues is terrible despite his stated intentions and he is about to betray us again with the marraige issue. i wish he had the nerve to either be honest about his views or act on his views. in oth
<LI>Dole becuse he is going to be the Republican Nominee.
<LI>Bob Dole, mostly because he's the best of what is left
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is committed to a free market economy, is a principled individual, would drastically reduce the size of the Federal Government and would have no foreign policy, i.e.: no entangling foreign alliances (re:  Korea, Vietnam, Bosnia, etc.).
<LI>Harry Browne: He is the only candidate who will actually reduce the size of the Federal Government.
<LI>Harry Browne - complete revision of Government - straight talk - no compromises
<LI>Clinton.  The Republican right has far too much power now and the rights of the "Silent Majority" are in danger if they are allowed to perpetuate their agenda.
<LI>Harry Browne - back to the Constitution, it's well-written
<LI>Bill Clinton.  I like what most people dislike about the president.  He is flexible in his stances on issues.  Some call this "waffling" but I see it as an essential quality in a complex and enormous democracy.  There is no sense taking a hard line stance on an issue when half of the people that you've been elected to represent most likely disagree with you.  Compromise is key and Clinton seems to understand that.
<LI>Dole - Clinton is an embarassment
<LI>Harry Browne, He's cool
<LI>Browne, because he best reflects my views on government
<LI>Dole - So the congress and senate can get down to business
<LI>Harry Browne - If the national media would stop ignoring him, the public would see he is the only candidte with real answers to our country's major problems.
<LI>Harry Browne - he is the only candidate who actually wants to decrease the size of the government
<LI>Harry Browne, to downsize government.
<LI>patrick buchanan
<LI>The canidates available to choose from are  worthless rich bastards who can afford to purchase a job as a status signal.  I think that the best person for the job would be Joe Public.  My boss who make $30,000 per year as owner of the company, and would take the job of President of the United States of America for the same wage.
<LI>Alan Keyes - Position on the Founding Documents and Morals.
<LI>It would be refreshing to see a true leader emerge.  The US gov't needs to wake up before we become a third rate country!
<LI>Newt Gingrich because he is the most brilliant mind to appear in politics since Alexander the Great.
<LI>Bob Dole: of the viable candidates, he is much closer to my beliefs.  Also, Bill Clinton is a lying adulter who is an embarassment to me as an American.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he will put the country back on track towards following the Constitution
<LI>I very much want Bill Clinton for a second term.  I believe he is doing an excellent job for the country. I can't stand all the bickering on the part of the republicans. I won't vote for any of them and I'm Independent.
<LI>bob dole, because he is for a balanced budget
<LI>dole
<LI>Harry Browne because he will cut the size of government and lift the burden off of the backs of the American people.
<LI>Harry Browne:  Republicans and Democrats all *sound* like Libertarians when they're campaigning.  Once elected, however, they return to the same old expansion of government.  They ignore the Constitution (particularly the 10th Amendment, but other parts as well).  They continue to pass laws without even reading them.  (Who could possibly read and understand everything that's in those huge documents?)  They continue to exempt themselves from their own laws.  Social Security, as a "pay as you go" system,
is bankrupt.  Medicare is bankrupt.  The military is abused for political purposes to prop up foreign dictators and tyrants.  And all the while, they dig us deeper in debt, with a third of the federal budget *just paying interest* on the national debt.  The major candidates (Clinton and Dole) appear to care very little about these issues.  Government doesn't work.  This time, I'm voting my conscience.  (See http://www.math.princeton.edu/~tpbarber/3pc/ideas/waste.html for a good primer on "wasting votes."
<LI>Bill Clinton - his success speaks for itself
<LI>The Libertarian Cantidate, To reduce the influence of the US government in our lives.
<LI>Harry Browne: I want more liberty (less regulation) in my social and business activities.
<LI>Harry Browne! Govenment intrusion in our lives is the single greatest challenge we face. People must wake up and realize that asking the government to interfere in the lives of others, just invites unwanted interference into thier own lives.
<LI>Steve Forbes - We need an economically balanced government as well as a conservative republican leader who does not constantly try to punish people for being wealthy.  Most wealthy people have to work extremely hard for their money and get no health benefits or NO TAXES for clothing, toys, etc (like the military which has one of the easiest lives out there...)
<LI>Bill Clinton. Believes in what he says and tries to accomplish it.
<LI>Bill Clinton because i'm a Democrat & i support the President 
<LI>Spock and Data in '96!  The logical choice.
<LI>Lamar Alexander is the only Republican save Christie Whitman and Colin Powell who can garner the kind of bipartisan support necessary to win the presidency. 
<LI>Bob Dole, for his traditional, conservative values.  Clinton has been a pox upon the nation.
<LI>any libertarian canidate will suffice, simply because the government has forgotten who they work for
<LI>Ralph Nader. Why isn't he listed as a choice? Proven history of putting people first.
<LI>Harry Browne, increase freedom
<LI>Harry Browne, I would like to live my life with less government regulations.
<LI>harry browne - need to greatly reduce power of govt.
<LI>Harry Browne, to rightsize the Federal government
<LI>Bill Bennett
<LI>Bob Dole, no whitewater scandal
<LI>Harry Browne--supports individual rights
<LI>Bob Dole, he is a man of great character
<LI>Bob Dole, experience, loyalty, decency, sensible, not driven by the polls
<LI>I don't find any of the candidates highly satisfactory.
<LI>BOB DOLE HE WANT'S TO MAKE THINGS BETTER NOT WORSE
<LI>Harry Browne.  I agree with every position he supports.
<LI>Harry Browne, Views on less government
<LI>Clinton  because his views are closer to mine than are those of his opponents
<LI>Harry Browne,will deliver on his promise to reduce the gov.
<LI>Browne - for a smaller government burden
<LI>bill clinton-he may appoint 2 judges to supreme court 
<LI>I can't stand this corrupt President, so I would have to vote for Dole.
<LI>Harry Browne, so that the influence of government in our lives can be reduced.
<LI>Harray Browne
<LI>If Bob Dole were a movie title, what would it be? "Dead Man Walking."
<LI>Bob Dole: He will reduce Government spending and bring a fair and responsible government to the people.
<LI>Bill Clinton.  He's the most intellegent U.S. President we have had in my lifetime.
<LI>Bill Clinton, has done good job compared with previous presidents.
<LI>bob dole / he has character
<LI>Bob Dole because this country can't handle 4 more years of Clinton.
<LI>Harry Browne, Less government NOW!
<LI>Bob Dole
<LI>Bill Clinton because he is keeping us on the right track.
<LI>Bob Dole has the leadersip ability this country needs now!
<LI>Dole:
<LI>Bill Clinton because he has done a good job and cares about all members of society
<LI>Bill Clinton, because he has ideas, talks clearly and understandably about his ideas, trys to at least pass what he can, cares about enviornment, education, and the national debt, talks welfare reform not just throw it out.
<LI>Harry Browne, ... to REALLY bring about the end of BIG GOVERNMENT!
<LI>Rudy Giuliani
<LI>Dole is a working politician, Clinton and husband are liars
<LI>Bob Dole ; character and leadership experience/ability
<LI>Bill Clinton-he's done a good job so far and is the only candidate who can realistically win.
<LI>Harry Browne - He's the only one with a chance of winning who demands a smaller, less intrusive government.
<LI>browne, for a return to pure constitutionalism and ind.freedom
<LI>Colin Powell.  As someone once said, the best person for a job like President is the one who doesn't want it!
<LI>Bill Clinton, because his is the less conservative one
<LI>harry browne
<LI>Bill Clinton, He is the only qualified person. 
<LI>BUCHANON.  HE IS HONEST, PATRIOTIC, TOUGH MINDED, GOD FEARING, AGAINST THE NEW WORLD ORDER, AGAINST NAFT & GATT, PRO MILITARY, ANTI-HOMOSEXUALITY AND ANTI-ABORTION.
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is incorrupt, wise and dedicated to liberty and a free market, with much less government intrusion in our lives.
<LI>A Libertarian to end Socialism in this country
<LI>BILL CLINTON  HE HAS WORKED HARD  ABOVE PARTY LINE
<LI>Brown to reduce gov't and na'tl debt
<LI>Bill Clinton, I feel he is finally getting things done.
<LI>Any one who support consumption tax and nationwide medical coverage
<LI>Harry Browne - eliminate gov't intrusion!
<LI>Rick Tompkins or Harry Browne. Our problems are caused by gov't instrusion and corruption
<LI>Clinton.  He has done well in his first term and is not an idealogue or an extremist.
<LI>Clinton will provide balance to the republican congress
<LI>Any Libertarian.  To stop government oppression.
<LI>clinton possesses compassion for the poor; dole, though a decent sort, is unimaginative.nitive
<LI>Bill Clinton, has done his job the past 4 years. 
<LI>Bob Dole
<LI>dole
<LI>Bill Clinton because the rest are much worse
<LI>Harry Browne - Freedom was the whole idea.
<LI>Bill Clinton, I think he's on the right track.
<LI>Bill Clinton--I believe he better understands the problems facing middle-class families, as well as families living at or below the poverty level.
<LI>Ideally, and idealogically, Alan Keys.  Only choice, Bob Dole.
<LI>Harry Browne Honest & Sensible
<LI>Ross Perot or a clone.  We need a business man to start pulling us out of our financial catastrophe.
<LI>Harry Browne because I believe his plan would save the country from bankruptcy.
<LI>Harry Browne, to reduce size of government
<LI>Harry Browne, because the government must be made to respect citizens' rights.
<LI>Rep Joe Kennedy - The best man for the job
<LI>Bob Dole-he shares more of my beliefs than Clinton or her husband
<LI>bob dole --i believe a America is going down the drain
<LI>Prefer Harry Browne, mostly bacause I don't see any real difference between the 2 major parties.  BOTH will, ahem, screw us.
<LI>Bob Dole -- honest, experienced, mature
<LI>I would like to have a Libertarian in the White House.  We have become a country of "blamers".  No one wants to take resposibility for their own actions.  Every time something goes wrong they want someone else to bail them out.  Generally this is always been thought of as the govenments' responsibility.   I want a president who advocates less government control and responsibilty.   We need to stop creating programs proliferate the governmemt "crutch".  I believe Harry Browne and the Libertarian party a
e the best answer for 1996.
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Harry Browne.  A Libertarian President would create a great balance in the Federal Government.  It would keep the partison, status-quo, parasitical, in-fighting losers that call themselves "politcians" in check.  Vote the individual, not the "party."
<LI>Nader because he is not beholden to big business and because  he has made his career out of helping the average working class consumer. A vote for Nader endorsed by a third party would send a message that a significant portion of the American electorate i
<LI>Sen. John McCain is a true American hero who would bring a reform yet not radical outlook to the White House.
<LI>Harry Browne  the only hope for a return of liberty and justice
<LI>CLINTON- he is the only democratic canidate that has a chance
<LI>Harry Browne has taken a stand on issues which can be viewed as more than calculated political rhetoric because he is not a professional politician concerned with re-election.
<LI>Bill Clinton so that he can put a hault on that crooked Republican Congress that is in the pocket of corporate America
<LI>Dole, he has class and experience also values to guide him
<LI>Jerry Brown - the only candidate in recent memory who seemed to be fair, and with good intentions.
<LI>Harry Browne. Freedom.
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Bob Dole is the best candidate due to his policies and character.
<LI>Bob Dole, A real American Hero
<LI>Dole - At least he wants to slow down government intrusion
<LI>The candidates in 96 are not that great, I despise Dole and dislike Clinton. Unfortunatly I have to vote for the one I dislike.
<LI>Browne is the only serious candidate who is serious about reducing the size of the mammoth, painfully inept, and woefully corrupted federal government.
<LI>Harry Browne - He has a better understanding of the functions and limitations of government.
<LI>Harry Browne - he stands for less government.
<LI>Harry Brown or Steve Forbs, Reason: Both major parties want to control the public(Rep. social control/ Dem. economic control) They are the two halfs of the same coin that do not really believe in individual choice and individual freedom.
<LI>Colin Powell.  He could unite us as a nation and he is more than qualified.
<LI>Harry Browne.  Gov't must be reduced or eliminated.
<LI>Clinton, because he has done a few of the things he promised, like reducing the size of government
<LI>Harry Browne -- possible return to the Constitution -- Federal Government should be stripped of all functions except for the Big Three plus Departments of State and Defense. The central (Federal) Government should establish national policy which the states would enforce. States would collect ALL taxes and then "pay" the central government on a House district basis.
<LI>Bill Clinton- I think he's done a good job as President
<LI>Harry Browne.  He's the only candidate who would *really* work to reduce government significantly.
<LI>Harry Truman - He was honest
<LI>Bill Clinton because hes the only good choice
<LI>coiln powell because he as experinxce
<LI>Pat Buchanan - against big govt. and NAFTA/GATT
<LI>Harry Browne with Liberty and Justice for All
<LI>Pat Buchanon, because of his stance on abortion, plans to get out of the U.N., his ideas on how to stop illeagal immigration, his plans to shrink the size of government, and his plans to give more decisionsto the states. 
<LI>Clinton, age
<LI>any christian conservative /phyosophil differences are ruining young people of today
<LI>Clinton because he is concerned about people
<LI>Harry Browne, personal liberty from the gov't and my neighbors
<LI>Harry Browne, because his view of government most closely represents my philisophical principles.
<LI>Harry Browne, he believes in individual liberty
<LI>Honestly, I would like to see Dan Quayle as president in 1996. Dan Quayle is an accomplished politician with character.
<LI>Bill Clinton.  Ever since he entered the office, he has been doing his job especially trying to improve everybody's lives.  Such as the economy itself, the environment and the likes.  However, I do believe that people should see Clinton win the '96 Presidental Campaign.  
<LI>Clinton
<LI>Bill Clinton because he keeps in mind the average person and tries to make the best choices so the middle class and lower class do not have to shoulder the full responsibility of this country.
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Harry Browne, because we must return to a society run by those who want the poeple to be independent, instead of government-dependent
<LI>Clinton - what other choice do I have???
<LI>Dole.  Clinton can't be trusted
<LI>Bob Dole, he brings honor back into the White House.
<LI>clinton. to keep the republicans in check.
<LI>Bob Dole:  He has moral character, is a leader, served with honor for his country, gave his right arm for his country, is not a liar!
<LI>I'll vote for Clinton as the best choice available. 
<LI>Bart Simpson. He's got great hair.
<LI>BILL CLINTON , YOUNGER AND BETTER QUALIFIED THAN DOLE
<LI>Bob Dole.  Clinton is spending too much money on bad ideas.
<LI>Bob Dole...if Clinton gets re-elected, I'm moving to Canada!  Seriously, I don't understand how American's can ignore the fact that Bill Clinton is a LIAR!!!  He is unethical, he has no morals or character.  It makes me sick knowing my grandfather fought in three wars, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, and there's a draft dodger in the White House.  I love America, but right now, I'm ashamed of our leader.
<LI>Browne - Freedom
<LI>Bob Dole, since he has the Rep. nom.  Can't trust "Bill"
<LI>Harry Browne - I just can't trust Democrats and Republicans anymore, its time for a real change.
<LI>Bob Dole because he represents my conservative values, is honest and has integrity
<LI>Pat Buchanan..He is the only one that wants to reduce the government down to constitutional levels.
<LI>Bob Dole because Bill Clinton is an idiot and has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he is unqualified to run our country.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is honest, fair, and Libertarian.
<LI>Bill Clinton, clearly more caring and fear of a republic goverment and incluence of the right wing!
<LI>Bill Clinton, best choice among many undersirables
<LI>Harry Browne - because he's not one of the "good old boys".
<LI>Clinton; he takes a licking and goes on ticking!
<LI>His "friends" are guilty, his successor in Arkansas is guilty, and he had not done anything illegally regarding Whitewater?!?  Yeah Right, and I've got a bridge to sell you.
<LI>Bill Clinton - He shows concern for issues that will HELP our society, not divide it.
<LI>Harry Browne.  If he carries out his ideas we can turn our country around again!
<LI>Harry Browne is the only alternative to the big mess in DC
<LI>Harry Browne. Read his book. That's what I want to see for our county.
<LI>Harry Browne - greatly reduced government
<LI>Bob Dole because he is a man of integrity and honesty.  He is a man that I don't always agree with but he is a man who cares that America is the best it can be.  His backgrounds shows this to be true.
<LI>Harry Browne.  The democrans and republicrats have a lot more in common than they pretend to.  It's time to make these polyticrites get real jobs and return political power to people who actually remember what it is like to work for a living.  Also it is about time that "We the People" quit squishing "I the Individual."
<LI>H. Browne because I think he can balance the budget successfully.
<LI>Harry Browne - much smaller gov't, more personal freedom
<LI>Harry Browne -- before the Federal Budget totally collapses
<LI>Myself, I stand for everything I believe in.
<LI>I hope and I see from the other political polls that Harry Browne is the best choice that we have as a nation. PS in reference to question 15 we have a flat tax now. Contact me if you care to discuss this. wwatts@nothinbut.net
<LI>Dole
<LI>clinton..because experienced; better choice; admits his past mistakes, & who cares if he didnt go to vietnam...he's human & i like it because of his family ties with wife; daughter and mother..shows he is human not a washington robot...only God is prfect!!! he's the best choice...the only other person i would vote for is God...my Republican husband is voting for President Clint too!!! & he spent 6 tours in viet nam!!!
<LI>Harry Browne - He will cut gov't
<LI>Bob Dole-Not a phony southern governor
<LI>Bill Clinton-- He is the best of the candidates out there
<LI>Dole. Clinton is a boat anchor with reguards to change.
<LI>Harry Browne; he will begin the process of ending governmental control.
<LI>Clinton, the lesser of two evils
<LI>Robert Dole
<LI>Harry Browne - radical changes in the size of the government
<LI>Given the choice I would prefer Bob Dole. I feel Clinton is too amoral to be national leader. Dole is a proven professional.
<LI>Steve Forbes, the flat tax.
<LI>Clinton
<LI>Harry Browne,  The Libertarian party has some excellent idea.  The Republicans and Democrats have not been able to accomplish anything in the White House.  I'm will to let another party, with fresh ideas give it a try.
<LI>Bob Dole.   He is clearly the only person of Presidential stature currently running for the office.
<LI>I would like to see Clinton relected.  He the best choice at this point.
<LI>Whitewater.... Clintons.... GUILTY!
<LI>Reverse the trend to big government
<LI>Bob Dole - less gov't intrusion
<LI>Bill Clinton - If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  America ain't broke, some work in progress, but were on the correct path.
<LI>Harry Browne,  I see little dirrerance between  demo and repubs
<LI>browne- he does not subscribe to the myth that government can work
<LI>Bob Dole...he is a good man for the office and also has alot of experience
<LI>Steve Forbes because most of his goals are reasonable and I agree with him on most issues
<LI>Dole - words mean things and Bill Clinton has lied enough
<LI>Harry Browne - the only consistent advocate for govt reduction
<LI>Pat Buchanan   He  believes in what he stands for.
<LI>Bill Clinton or Al Gore or possibly Colin Powell
<LI>Harry Browne; because he is for limiting goverment's involvement in our lives
<LI>Clinton, cuz I don't want any of the ultra conservative types to gain power...
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is the only candidate who will get government out of our wallets, out of our bedrooms, and out of our lives.
<LI>Bob Dole 
<LI>Bob Dole:  He has Character
<LI>Bill Clinton. Most qualified and has proved it over the last 3 1/2 years.
<LI>Clinton - Has a better grasp of Am. situation than Newt!
<LI>Dole because he has moral integrity and standards. It has been an embarrassing 4 yrs. We have lost face w/other nations.  He also will appoint less liberal judges, that will only help the justicial branch. 
<LI>Bob Dole, he will be the republican nominee, thats who I will vote for.
<LI>Dole; The best candidate with a chance to win.
<LI>Bob Dole because he will sign the bills that "Bill" vetoes!
<LI>Clinton, coz Dole-Gingrich are right-wing nuts and they scare me
<LI>Alan Keyes - America has only so much time left!
<LI>Marci Kaptur-Ross Perot or ANY REFORM PARTY candidate Bob Kerry, James Traficant, Tim Penney, Dick Lamm, David Boren, Hank Brown, Linda Smith to give another option and beat Clinton
<LI>Bob Dole
<LI>Clinton, because he will protect social programs, education and the environment.
<LI>Bill Clinton - He's the lesser of two evils.  Bob Dole is too old and too republican.  I think that Dole would throw the United States into a modern dark ages or a modern McCarthy era.
<LI>A president who really thinks of America first.
<LI>Harry Browne: I consider myself to be socially liberal and economically conservative.  I believe that Congress would serve to curb the more "radical" Libertarian ideas that scare most people off.
<LI>dole - past history is good, really wants to be president for the right reasons - not inflated ego - just a good person who has the political background to make a good president. 
<LI>It's boiled down to the lesser of two evils. Although I am against Republican conservatism, I make enough money to force me to vote for the group that will provide me the best tax incentives. Democrats will not do that.
<LI>Dole He is better qualify
<LI>Harry Browne - Because he will reduce Government!
<LI>Harry Browne.  He stands for freedom.
<LI>Harry Browne, he will produce noticable, positive results by reducing federal governement drastically.  He will reduce government to the size and scope originally intended by the authors of the US Constitution.  
<LI>BOB DOLE -CHARACTER
<LI>Harry Browne, Real tax reform, eliminate the IRS! Other reasons.
<LI>Browne, because he is a libertarian
<LI>Harry Browne, because everybody else is a clueless laut.
<LI>I want to see someone who DOESN'T feel like America is headed down the Evil Path and he is the only one who can stop it.
<LI>Moderate Congress Elected, Clinton re-elected
<LI>Bill Clinton -- He is a Good President
<LI>Harry Browne- I want to see the Government drastically changed, given back to the people.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he will get government off our backs
<LI>COLIN POWELL
<LI>Harry Browne--the ONLY candidate who clearly sees what the real problem is.
<LI>Jerry Brown. A moral, libertarian man who practices what he preaches, and perhaps is the only noncorrupt politician out there. Tune into his radio show, "We the People" on Pacifica Radio!
<LI>Harry Browne - less government
<LI>Democrats + Republicans = Exactly the Same, No Change ... We Need CHANGE
<LI>Bob Dole, at least he believes in something
<LI>Dole,  he is a grownup.
<LI>Pat Buchanon - I admire his attitude
<LI>Ross Perot = he seems more honest and really makes people think about politics
<LI>Alan Keyes...I like what he stands for on issues.
<LI>Harry Browne.  He will slash the size of government.
<LI>Bill Clinton--gay friendly
<LI>Bob Dole / Colon Powell (Pres/VP) They will (along with a republican congress) address the rising social security costs and make real progress in balancing the budget and reducing the national debt.
<LI>Bob Dole. He will bring credibility back to the White House.
<LI>I do not like the choices, however, Bob Dole is my choice. I would like to see our leader be a man of integrity. Honesty is paramount to govern a nation in strength. I believe out of choices available to us, that Bob Dole has this capacity. Everyone else fails miserably.
<LI>BOB DOLE, DEMOCRATS JUST HAVE IT ALL WRONG
<LI>Harry Browne:  His grasp of Libertarian Ideals.
<LI>Harry Browne, because the era of big government is over.
<LI>Bill Clinton because he is most likely to advance a national health plicy that will bring all Americans under coverage that will provide the needed coverage for all.
<LI>bill clinton because he cares and has an outstanding record
<LI>Clinton, best of the bunch.
<LI>Harry Browne: Feasible, concrete plan set forth in "Why Government Doesn't Work?"
<LI>I'm not really happy with any of the choices but whoever is and Congress need to cooperate and get something done instead of just lip service 
<LI>rush
<LI>Bill Clinton...He has done a good job and deserve re-election.  Bob Dole has been unable to articulate why he should be President, rather than Bill Clinton.
<LI>Dole- Can't take 4 more years of Clinton
<LI>No Republicans or Democarts. Both pander to big business and those minorities with financial and/or political power. It's time for coalition of small unadultrated parties who learn to compromise with each other to get the country going. Right now no one k
<LI>Pat Buchanan, he is for real Americans, not illegals.
<LI>Bill Clinton because he has moved our country forward as he promised in the 1992 election.
<LI>I would be most likely to support a moderate or liberal candidate who is experienced and does not pander.  Both Dole and Clinton are guilty of acting for political gain rather than on principle or common sense.  I would vote for Clinton, but more because I disapprove of the Republican agenda than because I approve of his.
<LI>Clintom- balanced control of  deficit and human issues
<LI>Clinton -- represents my views on most issues
<LI>Harry Browne.  It's time to kill the omnipotent state.
<LI>ANY LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE.  LESS GOVERNMENT, MORE CONTROL AT A LOCAL LEVEL.  A MARKET ECONOMY.
<LI>Almost anyone other than Clinton.  Dole seems to be the only
<LI>Harry Browne...Only candidate that will recognize and enforce Individual choice and Freedoms.
<LI>Harry Browne because he's the only one willing to ditch the IRS and balance the budget by CUTTING GOV'T. EXPENSES
<LI>Bill Clinton. The Other choise is same old, same old.
<LI>Bob Dole, because he supports many of my beliefs.
<LI>Pat Buchanan, because he stands on principle and believes what he says
<LI>HARRY BROWNE - LIBERTARIANS OFFER NEW ALTERNATIVES
<LI>Anyone but Bill Clintonl
<LI>Pat Buchanon because he's not scared of dealing with the issues that need to be dealt with, he pulls no punches and I believe his ideas to be valid, workable ideas. He stands for morality and America first.
<LI>Jesus Christ, because He is the Way the Truth and the Life
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is the only candidate who believes citizens of the U.S. should have more liberty than they currently have, not less.
<LI>bob dole, i believe he supports less gov.
<LI>Bob Dole, because he is the GOP candidate
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate who stands firmly for less government.
<LI>Anyone (even None of the Above) other than Bill Clinton. Why? Be serious!
<LI>Bill  Clinton  because  he  supports  education  and  to  be  honest  is  really  the  best  of  an  overall  bad  bunch.
<LI>Someone from middle class (there are the ones that pay for everthing)
<LI>Gen. Colin Powell/ I appreciate the authority he represents in dealing with the Middle East and other places.  He has been there, and knows whether WE should be there , or not.  I feel that we need to have somebody in office that can make a decision, and stick to it!  I think Gen. Colin Powell would do that!  I also agree with his views on many other things.
<LI>Harry Browne because he will seriously try to reduce government and taxes
<LI>Harry Browne, had enough big government.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he's the *only* one who proposes *less government*, not more. 
<LI>Dole. Would offer a charnce to get contract with America passed.
<LI>bob dole - character, credibility, a fighter
<LI>Bill Clinton, best available candidate, we need a balance to the strong right-wing tendencies of the Congress (especially the House of Representatives)
<LI>Harry Browne for a better life
<LI>Bob Dole less government & lower taxes
<LI>dole
<LI>O.J. Simpson
<LI>Ambassador Alan Keyes  has more experience and know-how than all the rest put together.  
<LI>Bill Clinton-stands up to congress and does'nt take their crap
<LI>BOB DOLE, GET THE JERK OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE!!!
<LI>Bob Dole
<LI>Harry Browne - The only candidate who has the consistent, moral philosophy of government that initiates no force against its citizens and exists only to protect people from force or fraud initiated by others.
<LI>Harry Browne-to reduce the size and cost of Federal gov't.
<LI>Harry Browne - we need REAL change
<LI>Buchanan He is the only candidate who knows what he believes
<LI>Bill Clinton should be re-elected. He is a proven leader with great ideas. He has hope for the future of the country and believes that a government empowered by the people can do good.
<LI>Harry Browne:  Restore Individual Rights
<LI>I trust Clinton. He came into office facing a mess, I am willing to give him more time to implement HIS plans for fixing the problems that the republicans left us with.
<LI>Bill Clinton He's the only person I believe who can beat Dole.
<LI>Harry Browne to save us from collapse
<LI>anybody but clinton,he is the consumat mesomorph dirven solely by the poles and photo opps.
<LI>Bill Clinton because he's on the right track
<LI>Harry Browne:  Government needs to be drastically reduced from the all-powerful, uncaring machinery it has become.
<LI>Pat Buchanan, for he stands strong on what he believes and he has a vision for America.
<LI>Rep. Henry Bonilla-R-Texas
<LI>Harry Browne.  Read his book!
<LI>Harry Browne because he is a Libertarian.
<LI>Alan Keyes for his knowledge of America's true problem: poor moral standards
<LI>President Clinton has done a credible job and deserves to be re-elcted.  Bob Dole and the Republicans are irresponsible, appealing to all that is worst in the American electorate; hatred, fear, bigotry.  Clinton is far from perfect, but thank God he's around!
<LI>Definition of a campaign platform and actually sticking to the principals behind it.  Removing moral issues, such as pro-life, from the political arena and putting them to a vote.  Treat government as a business with finite reaources and then priortize i.e. finscal responsability.  I realize the president can not achieve many things by himself, however, he should stand behind these principals.
<LI>bill clinton, "Dole is '96"
<LI>bob dole
<LI>ralph nader, gov. by people not corporations
<LI>Browne, because Dems & Repubs are too similar and don't represent me.
<LI>Bob Dole: He has the necessary experience in government and knows the system.  Clinton is a fish out of water.  He talks a good game, but doesn't know the rules and only listens to the last person he talks to, usually a person steeped in liberal hogwash.
<LI>clinton

<H2 align=CENTER>What are your thoughts on drugs/drug usage?</H2>

<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_DRUGS -->
<LI>Smoking should be outlawed, Drugs definately should be illegal, Alcohol only in moderation, harsher penalties for drug dealers& users
<LI>The goverment should stop wasting the money they spend on stoping the flow of drugs into this country.  The last report I saw show that they spent 22 billion dollars to stop 2-3% of the pot and coke coming into the US in '94.  I think it is time for a new goverment.
<LI>it breaks my heart to see so much sadness and trouble created by the use of alcohol and drugs.  The possible great minds and controbutions lost because of them.  Families destroyed. A true tragedy
<LI>I think that drugs such as marijuana should definatly be legalized, but as for crack...no, absolutly not.
<LI>I believe that what is being done to minimize drug, smoking, and alcohol use in minors and in some cases against adults is not enough. Especially in cases of minors. Many minors that are caught in the act get off with a slap on the wrist. But this does not help them it only tells them to be more carefull next time. If there were stronger penalties for minors then perhaps they would think twice.
<LI>All drugs should be legal in and of themselves but there should be penalties for driving, etc. under the influence.  Treat other drugs as alcohol (regulated), allow people to do what they want, and remove the element of crime.
<LI>certain drugs have psychological benefits, which should be legalized prescription-wise. other than that, all others should be illegal.
<LI>It is such a waste of one's life
<LI>IMHO, drug/alcohol usage is dangerous in too many ways - however, we can not legislate morality and a person's desire to self destruct. Marajuana is okay - but not while driving or on the job - but how do you control that? Alcohol, you can smell, pot you can't....?
<LI>The drug war causes more crime, death and government spending then drug use ever did.
<LI>Free access to drugs, but education is esential.
<LI>A Person that has a few cones is not a criminal!!!
<LI>i don't need drugs to be f***ed up!  seriously, i believe that a sizeable chunk of youngsters will WANT to try whatever adults say they can't do.  as a society, and as individual role models, we need to become more open to possibilities other than "DRUGS 
<LI>Banning drugs will do no good. Other methods of convincing people that they do not need them must be found.  The ideas must begin with the family which is continually under attack by the government and the media.
<LI>There are some people who have "addictive personalities;" no matter what, they will find something to abuse. The drugs are rarely much of an issue on their own, except for a few which are physically addictive on the first use. Even these would probably not be a problem if people didn't think they needed them.
<LI>I used to favor the legalization of drugs.  Once I realized that the taxpayers get stuck with all the bills, I stopped thinking that way.
<LI>Marijuanna should be leagalized and controled for profit by governments.  Stop the crazy tax spenditures in prosecuting a "nonsense" violation of usuages.
<LI>Marijuana could be legalized, but I think people who hurt others (ex car accidents) because they are under infuence of drugs should be punished a lot more severely than they are now.
<LI>the net should help bring us the TRUTH about drugs
<LI>It seems to me that drug use should be a personal choice issue. Existing penalties are entirely out of proportion to the acts committed.
<LI>The government has no legitimate power to legislate what I ingest or do to my body.  The very "war on drugs" that's supposed to help only worsens the problem by increasing the value of the drug trade to criminals, and thus, increasing the crime rate.  After all, this is just another form of prohibition, and we've already learned that doesn't work.  Or doesn't anyone read the history texts any more?
<LI>drugs are the worst problem every country in the world has ever seen.  The problem only seems to be getting worse and actions need to be taken in a organized worldwide manner to help eliminate the dealers and others profiting from drugs.
<LI>The problem is not drug use; it's drug ABUSE.  Instead of teaching children to "just say No", I think we need to educate the public on the genuine effects and consequences of drug use and to genuinely empower people to say no when they really don't want to partake.
<LI>I believe that marijuana should be readily available to people. It's good for glaucoma patients and you can get products from it such as paper. noone has ever died smoking it 
<LI>I really think drugs of any kind (except for medicinal purpospes) are detrimental. There are so many better and healthier alternatives to drugs for all the reasons I know that people use/abuse them. I wish we would find a way to give more people more positive alternatives as well as crack down on dealers AND users. Education, regulation, severe consequences, positive role models speaking against drugs...these are all good beginnings. We need to keep fighting.
<LI>I think drug use the way it is now is not that bad, but if more drugs were legalized, they could be more easily misused.
<LI>truthful education!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Question of personnel choice. People should learn how to use it and be responsable about it. 
<LI>in my high school(middle-class, upper)there is a huge drug and alcohol problem, over 75% smoke pot.  People like me who have nerver smoked pot, don't see it as a problem, for it seems as though it has little effect on those who do smoke.
<LI>Like cars some can handle it better than others
<LI>There should be greater punishments for dui and dwi offenders. 
<LI>All drugs considered, marijuana is the least understood.  When I did smoke it, I was much more in control than when using any other controlled substance or alcohol.  But, trying to explain this to someone who has never tried it is useless.  People who have never tried it see it as some evil thing just because it's illegal.
<LI>Drugs suck and mess up your mind and your life
<LI>Drugs should be illegal when they have mind altering effects in one standard dosage.  These drugs pose countless dangers to society.
<LI>Too much misinformation. Yes I use, but I do it in very moderate amounts and I enjoy it. I fail to grasp what harm I am doing anybody (I make a very good living). This is the land of the free, let me be free.
<LI>We need to be more realistic.  Drugs are dangerous, not evil.  But American laws currently do more damage than the drugs do.  Everyone should read http://www.druglibrary.org
<LI>Drugs, such as alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, marijuana have certain "side effects" which are known to affect behavior and moods, as well as long term health risks.  I really think its ridiculous to outlaw private use of these drugs.  For example, alcohol is a "legal" drug, but its not allowed in public, while driving, and at most workplaces.  I think the same should apply to all drugs.  Public intoxication, and drug abuse at work may continue to require stiff penalties, but allow people to do what they 
ant in the privacy of their own homes.  It will cut down on the non-violent prison population, and let teh addicts seek help in rehab places.  Make more room in the prisons for dangerous, violent offenders.  
<LI>The war on drugs is a result of peoples fear of loosing (illusion of) control over their lifes. Drugs can be a very potential (also dangers) tool, changing your mind. Education in drugs possibilities and dangers is important. In a free society drugs must be free available.
<LI>Drugs like nicotine and alcohol that are leagal are just as dangerous as marijuana but have more powerful lobbys. Since many people seem to need some form of drug (distillation of achohol has been around as long as civilization), but the moment they cause damage to others (second hand smoke, drunk driving) they should be illegal for those people. This would mean that smokers could only smoke in their own house if they lived alone, but too many smokers are harming their children without a thought and no
one is doing anything about it.
<LI>DRUGS IS ALSO KILLI
<LI>soft drugs used moderately or soft drugs used occasionally excessively is fun and stress relieving
<LI>The history of prohibition demonstrates it is not an effective answer to the drugs problem. 'Just say no' doesn't work, either. Drug testing is just jobs for the corporations - reflex and attention span tests would be a better test for fitness-to-drive (or whatever). Marijuana should be legalised. 
<LI>The gov't screwed up back in the 80's (?) when they sprayed all the marijuana w/ paraquat, which made all the dopers turn to cocaine.  I NEVER remember anyone getting their head blown off over $25 worth of pot, but I know of many people who have had their lives taken over $25 worth of cocaine.  Legalize marijuana and more lives will be saved than lost.
<LI>Most drugs should be legal. As long as the user is made aware of the consequences of taking a drug. I personally wouldn't want to snort something through a straw. But, some people do. If they are aware of what happens, then by all means let them do it.
<LI>should be legal
<LI>I believe that drugs if used in moderation, and with consideration can have a positive effect on your life.  There is a fine line between use and abuse, and some people can not distinguish.
<LI>It would be nice to be able to enter more than one answer for some of the questions.  Drugs should be regulated.  We are a bit schizophrenic about our drugs, insisting that those who use some are criminals while those who use others are "sick".  One should be responsible for one's actions at all times.
<LI>People have been taking drugs in Western society ever since the Ancient Greeks. They're not going anywhere. We need to legalize them all with extremely tight regulation.
<LI>There are valuable things that users can learn from drugs (that differ from person to person).  While some drugs seem to have little use in this category (opiates, for example), others, such as the phenethylamines, the lysergic acid derivitives, and the various tryptamines can stimulate a lot of discovery.  I personally will continue using drugs until I've reached a point where I'm not gaining much from them any more and then move on to other things.  I suspect that the reasons why many drugs are illeg
l isn't for the "safety" of the user or the community, but out of "darker" reasons--I suspect that in the case of many drugs, large corporations have a large influence in keeping them illegal (ex:  marijuana is strongly opposed by alcohol and lumber industries, which would probably lose a significant amount of revenue if marijuana were legalized).
<LI>Everything in moderation, especially moderation.  If tobacco is legal, why not marijuana?  The inequities in this country just cause more crime.
<LI>The country is spending a lot of money on this and I am not satisfied with the results.
<LI>Most drugs should be legal 
<LI>"Soft Drugs" like Marijuana should infact be legalized, while "hard drugs" like cocaine and heroin should remail illigal.  Where I live (humboldt county, aka the Emerald Triangle), Marijuana is (more or less) sociallily accepted, I think that the rest of the county (world) should (will) addapt to this form of thinking.  Legalizing marijuana would solve some important problems, especially the violence involved with drug use.  I think that if it were legalized, prices would fall (because it would be easi
r to use) and people would have less trouble affording it (and as we know a lot of violence occurs by people robbing others for their drug money).  The government could even tax the "drug" and make a small profit off of its sale...
<LI>Freedom means being able to do what ever you want to do, as long as it doens't hurt anyone else.  Drugs should be legal and regulated for quality.
<LI>Your questions on the survey were subjective.  Yes I have treied many drugs, and drink in my life.  I do not partake in any illegal drug or drink.
<LI>I think people should be left to their own devices. Unfortunately, most people are unable to keep their use (or mis-use) of these substances under control and as a result, bring many of the rest of us into the picture through auto accidents or other aberant behavior.
<LI>I think America and it's War on Drugs is all wrong.  A waste of money.  How can they make it illegal for a suffering human to smoke a little herb.  It's a lifesaver and the US prevents it's use.  It's a shame!
<LI>Drugs are mind expanding, harmful only the user and there should be no laws prohibiting them.  The government has once again proved itself in violation of constitutional ideals.  They want to enforce some common morals on people.  Fuck them.  I love drugs.
<LI>I think if people want to use drugs than they are free to. As for drug tests, why put the users with the abusers on the doll cue. Studies have shown that many people in 'top' jobs use marijuna for relaxation purposes. Drug testing is also a waste of money. The government spends so much on drug testing and prevention when the money could be going to a more profitable cause. (ie Education)
<LI>Education should begin at home. Drug and alcohol awareness should be priority in goverment, home, school, and church. Information should be widely available evertywhere.
<LI>For some people, natural drugs are just fine...  Leave it up to the person.  Chemical drugs such as crystall-meth should be more strictly educated about, and should remain illegal.
<LI>I no longer use drugs or alcohol, but I believe it is a matter of individual choice.  Minors, however, should not legally be able to use drugs, nor should public use be allowed.  Adults should be able to use anything they want in private as long as no minors are involved and no one is forced to use anything.
<LI>Drug Testing is flawed. If you are in a room with smoke (such as a restroom in High School) from drugs and are tested you can lose your scholarship and other important things. 
<LI>Hello to all the BIG BROTHER agents viewing this survey.  Hope most of you are women.  If you are men ...  wow did you screw up by getting this detail!

<LI>Alcohol: OK  Drugs: Bad
<LI>The desire to use drugs is part of being human. Resistance is futile.
<LI>No drugs should be banned. Proper information/education is vital and the current situation is unacceptable.
<LI>I like the idea of being able to sue drug dealers for damages
<LI>Learn as much as you can.  Experiment with the "less dangerous" types, like the one's I have.  Consume in moderation the drugs you like at the times you can afford to be "dazed."
<LI>The gov't is creating most of the problem.  It should stay out.
<LI>The current War on Drugs is accomplishing nothing except destroying lives and making smugglers rich. Legalization with realistic education, not scare tatics would be more productive. Elimination of the black market and identification of those in need of help would go further and cost less as taxation on alcohol and marijuana sales could easily pay the cost of rehabilatation of those who are in need of it.
<LI>personal freedom.  objective reality.
<LI>It seems to me that most of the problems regarding drugs stem from the fact that they can only be obtained by criminals.  If more drugs were decriminalized, criminals would no longer dominate their sale.
<LI>Anyone stupid enough to use drugs should be punished to the same extent as drug suppliers which presently is pathetically short of what is justified.  
<LI>I HAVE NO IDEA
<LI>It is all very horrible because of what it does to your body
<LI>GENERALLY AND IDEALLY, EVERYTHING SHOULD BE LEGAL AND FREELY AVAILABLE TO NORMAL ADULTS. EVERYTHING IS "FOR PEOPLE" IF USED RESONABLY. BUT, TAKING CIRCUMSTANCES INTO ACCOUNT, SOME DRUGS (LIKE REAL-HARD DRUGS: HEROINE, CRACK ETC. OR QUICKLY-DESTROYING ONES - GLUE ETC.) SHOLD BE AVAILABLE UNDER CLOSE MEDICAL(?) CONTROL.
<LI>Alcohol SHOULD be regulated like prescription drugs like MORPHINE or even BANNED in the U.S.  There are many of my friends in high school that have tried and still smoke weed; They were once B+ --  A- students, but now they're in the lower D -- E  range. It is quite obvious that weed should be more tightly regulated(IF legalized) to prevent such tragedies from occuring again. 
<LI>Most drugs should be legalized and taxed with the tax revenue used to help addicts if they want it.  This would lessen crime and open up prison space for true criminals who are constantly getting released to make room for non violent drug offenders. 
<LI>I Feel That Drugs Such As Marijuana Should Legalized Taxed & Regulated Rather Than Spending All The Time, Money And Resources To Fight It. We Could Make Tax Dollars Regulating It And Spend That Money To Fight More Harmful Drugs Such As Cocaine & Crack.To 
<LI>Hard drugs no! Personel use of Marijuana yes!!
<LI>I THINK MOST PEOPLE WITH DRUG OR ALCOHOL PROBLEMS OR USE HAVE A DEEPER PROBLEM .AND WE SHOULD HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE OF USE OF DRUGS OR ALCOHOL WHEN DRINING
<LI>Drugs are dangerous.  No. 16 should have an "other" category. People look to drugs because they don't believe in themselves, God, or their fellowman.
<LI>I feel that drug usage is a normal human attribute.Unfortunatley many people are weak and succumb to addiction,or some sort of other reliance to certain substance.I feel that choice and education are extremely important,the war on drugs has caused far too many innocent casualties,I am a firm believer that Marijuana prohibition must end,it is many times safer than alcohol,and causes far less social problems.I find it apalling that heroin and cocaine are used for medicinal purposes,yet cannibis remains a
dark horse of a drug.Stop the war,overgrow the government!!Peace.
<LI>I think that drugs are useless and people who use controlled drugs should be taken out and shot instead of reformed
<LI>I feel that pro-hibition of Marijuana is as foolish and usless as the pro-hibition of alcohol in its time...Marijuana is far less addicting than alcohol and has many documented medical uses which if put to use would help many people end or reduce their su
<LI>I feel the fact that drugs ARE illegal makes them such a problem in this country.  In the 1920's, there were no laws against drugs. Were people constantly strung out?  NO... Was there a high crime rate, relating to drugs?  NO... Only when drugs became illegal did the problems start.  A similar example of this would be prohibition.  It had the same effect.  When alchohol was legalized again, the problems stopped.  
<LI>Someone must address the addiction problems at all social levels.
<LI>I also think there should be more stringent penalties on users as well as dealers, especially those who deal to kids
<LI>Everyone should be able to make his own choices in this matter -- it is not the government's business
<LI>Marijuana Should be legalized for those over 18 years of age.  Harder drugs for those over 21.  Taking the illegality out of drug use would remove the thrill of drug use for teens.  Removing drug users from the prison system would make more room for real criminals that prey on innocent victims.  The money spent on fighting the War on Drugs could be used to help those who have a real drug problem. 
<LI>Drug s are BAD news!
<LI>Holland leads the way. Decriminalize soft drugs, regulate hard drugs, and treat users who have difficulty with compassion.
<LI>Marijuana is no worse, and in some ways better, than alchohol.  Those who claim Marijuana is bad for you, and make it illegal are hypocrits.  Alchohol is much more harmfull, yet remains legal.  The polititions know that the peons need some kind of drug to dull their senses from the shitty life they have been given.  Otherwise, all drugs would be illegal.
<LI>Throwing someone in jail for using drugs is a horrendous crime.
<LI>Education of the potential users has been more effective in the past. Severe,I mean Severe penalties for dealing would certainly stop much,see Singapore.
<LI>drugs are often the escape zone of the lower class
<LI>I belive the states&governments should get together & relise their true enemies hard drugs are the true killer of all children & adults alike and stronger attention put on education & addiction rehabilitation .Marijuana is a good occasional relife &  cheaper prouducts can be produce for all to benifit (IT'S NATURAL)
<LI>they are victumless crimes and should not be regulated by the Government
<LI>Drugs which are relatively safe should be available to all, assuming that the benefits and drawbacks are presented objectively.  Drug abuse, on the other hand, is not a problem -- it's a symptom.
<LI>Moderately used, most of them are not dangerous.
<LI>They tear down society by destroying lives of the users and others associated with them.
<LI>I think that All Illeagle substances should be made available by and taxed by the U.S. Gov.'t. The prices and quality should be controlled. Money saved on law enforcement needs to be channeled into anti drug campaigns.
<LI>Legalization of drugs would eliminate dealers and the crime surrounding them.  People who want drugs are going to get them wherever they must, it may as well be safer and from the government.  If drugs were regulated we could be sure of purity instead of 
<LI>laws are completely stupid. Should be a matter of personnal choice. Drug usage is not a problem for me : my life continues normaly
<LI>Most illegal drugs should be legalized.  We waste our collective energy pursing this victimless crime.
<LI>It is something that is not worth the pain and aggravation it causes.
<LI>The federal government must take a position on the importation of illegal drugs, and commit to preventing penetration of our borders. Federalizing National Guard, or regular Army troops devoting solely to the purpose of inderdicting drugs is an approach which must be taken seriously under consideration.
<LI>I think certain drugs should be legalized.  Especially the ones that the government pays billions of dollars to stop.  I think it is sort of obvious, that the government cant stop certain people from doing stuff.
<LI>adopt program of harm reduction, not prohidition-see Netherlands
<LI>Trust me,more people smoke pot than you can imagine.
<LI>there is no peace or tranquility like you get when your high comes from personnal achievements. In the beginning of sobriety, even waking up with a clear conscience and total remembrance of everything you said or did the night before is a high 
<LI>Since time began there are substance abusers of one form or another, I feel strongly that our country is not dealing strongly enough with the major drug producing nations, but I realize everything revolves around money and influence.  The more we change the more we stay the same!
<LI>Dealers and suppliers are the ones to go after to stop drug use.
<LI>If you imbibe, know what you are doing.  Do not hurt anyone.
<LI>drugs and their misuse is one of the greates problems facing our society today but the government and others who are responsible for addressing it on a national scale have not really done a single useful thing to help. not mush will help until legalizatio
<LI>I believe in education and responsibility.
<LI>I think anyone should be able to buy whatever they want, without prescription, from a local store.  If you are dumb enough to want to kill yourself, feel free!  Just don't cry if you are arrested for being under the influence and hurting someone else.
<LI>Any drug in moderation can be benificial to the individual.  It's the small percentage of people who can't control their use that ruin it for the rest of us who don't allow it to control them.
<LI>some people can handle them, some can't!
<LI>The over-regulation of "low-end" drugs (i.e. marijuana, 'shrooms, etc) leads to prisons full of non-criminals, while the murderers and rapists run free.
<LI>I think smoking and alcohol is fine when you are with yor friends or at a party but I think you should know your limits
<LI>Drugs are only dangerous because we make them that way, by not controling them, by making them illegal
<LI>The illegal drug trade is a major threat to the safety and security of the citizens of this country.
<LI>Drug laws make people think they are solving the drug problem - they're not. Better to legalize everything and then solve the real problems caused by society and the individual's psyche
<LI>The current drug war costs billions of dollars and incarcerates non-violent persons who seldom commit other crimes.              
<LI>should not be available
<LI>It destroys the family and the community, and needs to be stopped NOW!!!
<LI>Drugs should be legalized.  However, crime committed by those under the influence should severe.  Also, education of drug use affects is important.  The public should NOT subsidize or provide rehabilitation programs for those who chose to use drugs in their lives.  If people use drugs and screw up their lives, let them live with the consequences.
<LI>My thoughts on drug testing are not one of the available answers.
<LI>people should have some experiences with drugs at one time or another because then it makes them to experiencce a different kind of sensation but I don't think people should continue because it might lock them up and make their life too dependent on drugs. A human being should have control over himself/herself
<LI>Generally it's a non-productive activity.
<LI>I believe that it is up to the individual to make his or her mind up about drugs as well as everything else in life. Drugs of all kinds cause problems but it is up to the individual not governments or self-proclaimed moral guardians to come to terms with 
<LI>A more liberal approach to them would go a long way in addressing the problems
<LI>I like alcohol and I agree that marijuana should be legalized. All other drugs should carry heavy penalties for possession and death (or at least life in prison) for multiple dealing offenses.
<LI>Drug usage is the type of epedemic well beyond the control of gonernments or even the influence of churches.  The only real control over drugs begins and ends with a childs education at home.
<LI>Drugs should be stopped
<LI>I think marajuana is mostly harmless, but should not be legalized because then more of the mainstream population would figure it's ok to use it. The cigarette age should be moved up to 21 and more strictly enforced. Alcohol policies should stay as they are, but a)the age restriction should be better enforced and b) I'm not sure how, but we should figure out a way to keep people to moderate use, and make sure everyone who develops a problem is required to get rehab. PS I didn't know how to answer the qu
stion about drug abuse in the family; both my parents are heavy smokers, but I'm not sure how that counts as a *drug*--see my point about making marajuana legal?
<LI>I think drug and alcohol usage is one of the key problems with the world.  People think it helps them, but it really doesn't.  In fact, drugs just lower your communication, and without communication YOU'RE DOOMED.  Charles J Phillips-June 6, 1996
<LI>I belive that alcohol is a very strong drug, and I do not understand why marijuana is illegal?
<LI>I know that there are drugs that are very harmful to the system.  But the key to keeping kids off drugs is not just teaching them about the effects.  Kids are still curious and want to try things.  Plus, for many users, it is difficult to get caught so that is not a major problem.
<LI>Sad to see all the suffering a pain caused by drugs/alcohol. The need for drugs/alcohol is driven by godlessness and will eventually be solved when He resumes direct rule of the planet.
<LI>Do what you want, but the demonization of certain substances helps no one.
<LI>I LOVE DRUGS!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>If you do drugs, moderation, and education on their effects upon you are the key.
<LI>Before we can legalise any drug, society should demonstrate its ability to use it responsibly.  Currently, certain drugs are in this category (pot,alcohol,nicotine) while others may never be (crack,heroin,LSD)
<LI>Certain drugs will always be taboo and certain members of society will always find and use them.  Why? Because they're there!
<LI>I think Alcohol is a much worse drug than Pot, but I think all drugs are bad, so I wouldn't vote for the legalization of pot
<LI>I like drugs
<LI>I believe that drugs are more hyped up as of lately because America is undergoing it's own social decay. People are getting unhappier, so since there has been no one to explain to them about drugs, it must be something to do. 
<LI>Every person has drugs that work for them & drugs that work against them.
<LI>The criminalization of drug use results in terrible wastes of public money for ineffective law enforcement efforts.
<LI>Moderation is the key!
<LI>No excuse for starting.  Once on drugs, no excuse for not seeking help.
<LI>They are terriable because they ruin peoples lifes.
<LI>Like any potentially dangerous substance (including plastique, for example), regulation and monitoring are key to preventing abuse. 
<LI>Drug usage & drug problems are to do with the social maturity of the country in question. Countries such as the Netherlands have the correct mentality when creating laws concerning drugs, i.e. laws are for the people, not the other way around.
<LI>Education is the key for dealing with the problem. It will always be there but use can be drastically lowered
<LI>Education and peer association control are the two most effective remidies
<LI>Alcohol addiction is multi-generational (genetic).  Much more education needed here. Cocain, crack, meth dealers are cannibals - feeding off the lives of their own kind. Very, very hard time (not necessarily long) is needed. Repeat offenders should get long, long, hard time.
<LI>alchol is very dangerous drug it leads to domestic abuse,accidents in car-
<LI>With few exceptions, drugs should be legal and taxed to support rehabilitation and education efforts.  The war on drugs is bankrupt...a way for incompetent law enforcement officials to push buttons for funding, and little more.  More societal ills may be 
<LI>Some light drugs ex. mar. hash, should be legalized.
<LI>Education starts at home.  Common sense, if applied, will do the rest.
<LI>They're really juvenile; I don't care if someone uses drugs, but I immediately assume that they are immature.
<LI>Favor drug legalization with tight controls and taxes.  Police enforcement funds would be better spent for treatment. I haven't use so much as alcohol in 13 years.
<LI>Personally, I experienced drugs out of curiosity and decided not to be a regular user.
<LI>It is a well documented fact that when alcohol became illegal in the 1920's the level of violent crime sharply increased and then came back down when the prohibition was repealed.  It has also been documented that when other drugs became illegal in the 1960's the violent crime rate increased sharply again and remains high to this date.  Legalizing drugs would enable people to afford them on as little as minimum wage, so they would not have to resort to violent crime to feed their habits.
<LI>Illegal Drugs are ruining the lives of the younger generation
<LI>Legalize everything, and really bust people who use things improperly (like driving drunk, working high, etc).  Sort of an odd mix, and hard to enforce w/o better testing, but the best answer.
<LI>Governments should not be in the black marketing encouragement business. All drugs should be legal, subject to all normal taxes, subject to an "abuse tax," and the market/tort system used to control their quality (just like any other product). The "abuse tax" fund should be inviolate --  our social "masters" could not touch it -- and the system essentially a pre-payment for the inevitable problems occasioned by substance abuse. 
<LI>It is part of our rights to be able to do with our bodies as we see fit, even I harmfull, and it in no way says these rights can be taken away based on age, race, sex, or religon!!!!!!
<LI>Many narcotics are too powerful to be legalized, and I do basically believe in their being Illegal, but people who really want them are going to get them anyhow, so why shouldn't we (the citizens) benefit (through taxation) from the idiots (sorry, but I generally think it is a stupid habit) instead of getting screwed by them (by our tax dollars going to "the War on Drugs".)  For any circumstances, however, I believe they should be illegal to minors.  I hope this doesn't sound holier than thou, but it i
 my belief.
<LI>I think there should be a lot more education on the effect of drugs.
<LI>There were several questions that I had multiple answers e.  I do believe that all drugs should be legalized, but I also beleive that schools should teach children about drugs honestly.  I think the healthiest way to be, is without drugs, but it is often 
<LI>Most psychedelic drugs(LSD,Peyote,Marijuana) are relativly harmless unless you get carryed away with them. Alcohol can be dangerous, but is so accepted, it doesn't seem to matter.
<LI>There is a right time and place for drug usage. As long as it is used for medical purposes, all drugs proven to be effective should be legally available.  Drug dealers should be shot on sight.
<LI>There is no such thing as a harmless drug. All it does is makes you dependent on the dealer and the drug. People are easier to control by anyone if you are dependent. You lose all creativity and thought of success all you think about is the drug.  I see the damage this kind of shit does everyday and it doesnt get any easier to see a starving child or a child on dope because the parents spend all their money on drugs and give it to the child to keep it quiet.  Oh sure....Clinton would love it.
<LI>I think we need to get much more practical about the use of drugs.  We need to have an open mind about possible solutions.
<LI>Most psychoactive drugs like MJ, LSD, Peyote etc. should be legalized because they are so great! 
<LI>Drugs, and drug usage are merely a symptom of a more pressing problem, the decay of Society, and the need to relieve boredom, man's only true enemy besides death.
<LI>Individuals should keep all drug use to an absolute minimum. Nevertheless, drugs should be legalized in order to reduce crime and take the profit out of the drug business.
<LI>Any drug that can cause death/brain damage should be illegal, but things that are natural and harmless (marijuana) should be LEGAL!
<LI>kjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjk 
<LI>no comment
<LI>I don't use drugs or alcohol (unless we count Coke, and prescription medication).  I've never understood the need, the appeal of drugs.  Why do you need to get high?  I think it's a silly and immature need.  I know I'm biased; my mom was an alcoholic, and I spent my early teens dealing with the effects of her drinking.
<LI>Our country needs a stronger sentencing guideline...no more of this probation crap.  Especially when it comes to drug related crimes.
<LI>I think it is up to the parents to teach children right from wrong. I grew up in a Jewish household where it was a custom to drink wine on the Sabbath (Friday night). My parents were open to us drinking if it was with them at the dinner table. I think thi
<LI>Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are constitutional guarantees. For some people, the pursuit of happiness involves drug use. It is a personal choice, and it's none of the governments business. It used to be that people were persecuted for their religeous beliefs. It hasn't changed.
<LI>It is my believe (sp?) that the only way people are ever going to be truly free is if drugs which are *not* harmful in anyway to the body (marijuana, LSD, shrooms) are de criminalized.  Why are these drugs illigal?  Because the government cannot stand the idea of people been free.  We have been repressed.
<LI>I fell that laws against drugs go's against the consitution of the usa
<LI>Drugs are a personal choice.  People should be instructed in their use either through personal instruction or through a manual such as From Chocolate to Morphine by Weil.  Those people that hvae problems with certain drugs and continue to abuse them should be fined/rehabbed or even imprisoned.  Note that there is a definite difference between use and abuse.  Abuse is a pattern of behaviour that comes about over time and harms others.  Use is simply partaking of the drug.
<LI>they are extremely mind opening
<LI>Drugs are for people who want to have fun in a different fashion than is currently considered accepted. The key to fighting the drug problem is educating people in the effects of drugs and leaving people to their fun.
<LI>Opinions of the majority should not have the power to changes the lives of others.
<LI>people who are on drugs usually end up being slaves of,first, criminals--then secondly, the corrupted private industry of recovery or the beurocratic crap of the government 
<LI>drugs have been used for centuries. To the extent that there has been a problem, our current laws only serve to make things worse.
<LI>i put no answer for the drug testing catagories because none of the answers fit my situation.  i believe that certain in certain situations drug testing is acceptable (i.e. car wrecks) but the problem is that you can test positive for a drug long after it's effects have left your system.  while i have never been tested by an employer, i was forced to undergo random drug testing as a college athlete.  that aside, i don't believe that recreational drugs should be illegal; however, if someone committs a c
ime while on drugs, that person is responsible for the crime.  the fault lies in the individual, not the drug.  however, if there was a drug that directly caused a person to commit violence, then such a drug should be outlawed.
<LI>Current drug laws and the "war against drugs" just make the problem worse.
<LI>Prohibition causes more problems that drugs ever could
<LI>I believe some people are responsible and mentally mature enough to know hoiw to use certain drugs.  They should be allowed to do so.  If someone is too stupid to use them responsibly, then it is their own fault if something goes wrong.  Kids should be watched by their parents, not by the government.  The only time I agree with drug regulation is when a non-concenting party gets harmed by it (such as with drunk driving)...
<LI>A diference is to be made between majijuana/haschich and other drugs. Pot should be legalized.
<LI>Drugs are only abused by those with weak personalities.
<LI>I assumed 'for the purpose of getting high
<LI>drugs are part of life.  everything you consume or sense is a "drug"- if you have become aware of it, it has affected you.  it is simply a question of degree and follow on effects.  (eg: aroma therapy- smells can relax, stimulate etc.) therefore, "drugs" will not go away, no matter how draconian laws are. people have the right to choose, no government or organisation has the right to interfere with an informed adults right to choose their own behaviour, provided it does not harm others.  by this i mean
real harm, not bogus stats that, for instance "suggest" loss of income and "therefore" lower health as harm. The favoring of demonstrably more dangerous drugs by governmnts backed by vested interests, ie booze, and the concurrent suppression of cannabis culture and use, is a great, great hypocrisy.  I hope future generations will regard the idea of prohibition and its resultant excesses by dangerous fanatics in government employ, as a crime against humanity.  drug use is not the best choice  for recreation
l activity, but the attempts by governments to deny individuals the option is creating far more harm and damage to individuals and society as a whole than drugs ever will. legal drugs can be quality controlled and therefore safer and more predictable to use. most people with "drug" problems, really have a coping problem, or an addictive personality.  drugs are not the answer, but neither is arrest and incarceration and forfeiture of property and loss of employment.  May tolerance prevail, the ignorant be e
lightened, and the evildoing people in government and distribution be overthrown.  thankyou for the chance to participate.
<LI>I think they are good and ALL should be LEGAL!!!!!!!!! 
<LI>It is impractical and immoral to try to control what law-abiding adults put in their bloodstreams.
<LI>Too few people realise what drugs are about. Scaremongering tactics from governement officials hamper education secerely, leading to excacerbation of problems, esp. with younger people.
<LI>Drugs awareness is vital in making sure that teens do not get hooked on drugs at a young age. Fight herion etc and legalize marijuana.
<LI>Its fun but to addictive
<LI>Drugs are good for social occasions. People aren't so stuffy and they are more interactive. Great for deep thinking and creaticity.
<LI>catch the dealers,lock them up for ever
<LI>Recreationally, they're fine.  The laws should be less restrictive for adult personal usage.
<LI>I enjoy marijuana on occasion, and would like to see it legalized.  I, however, had a terrible battle with nicotine (much more addictive) and I believe it should be illegal... it is extremely harmful and has tremendous negative effects on ones day to day productive life.
<LI>Drug usage isn't a problem if the user is aware of the consequences and uses his/her drugs responsibly.
<LI>Drugs and alcohol are overrated both in terms of the problems they cause and the solutions they provide. Drugs and alcohol can ruin lives and wreck homes, yet in most cases they do not. There are far more recreational drug/alcohol users than abusers. The decisions you make about your drug/alcohol use are what determines their effects on your life.
<LI>Drug usage is not the problem, we use drugs every day, from tea, coffee, to alcohol and cigarettes. Problem is the prohibition, and prejudice, regarding the usage of some drugs (cannabis) which unables full concentration of authorities on hard drugs. In any way, prohibition is not the answer, apropriate education would do a better job. 
<LI>All drugs once is a funny game, you never get addicted, if you are stable enough to withstand any substantial repetition
<LI>Those that wish to do it should be allowed to, so long as it is only themselves that are affected (eg. Room full of MJ smoke is not appreciated by those who don't smoke it!!) Education is the key; everyone needs to know what the effects are before they start indulging in mind altering chemicals.
<LI>most of your available answers were not appropriate for me.  what people ingest is a personal choice and should be left up to the individual.
<LI>we should spend more of our money to fight the drug problem in the U.S.
<LI>I think all drugs should be legalized for a variety of reasons.  Number one, just using a drug does not mean that a person will commit any real crime, that is to say, crime with a victim.  An individual should be allowed to do anything they want to themselves.  Personal responsibility is something that is sorely lacking in our society.  Making drug use <and only certain types of drugs> illegal says that people cannot be responsible for their actions.  It says that the government knows what's best for e
eryone.  If drugs were legal it would also be a lot easier to determine what the REAL negative effects <if any> their were from each particular drug.  Then people could avoid the truly hazardous drugs and stick to the reasonbly safe ones, and/or make them purer and safer.  </A> 
<LI>Working as a paramedic I can see the very debilitating effects of the misuse of drugs and alcohol. It is a slow but sure way to ruin a life.
<LI>Strong physically addictive drugs should be banned, but availible for prescription to prevent criminality. (This way, drugaddicts will be forced to make themselves availible to anti-drug treatment. Drugs which doesn't make the user a threat to others should be legal and availible.
<LI>Just like weapons, some drugs are dangerous and some are INHERENTLY DANGEROUS, we should require a licence, just like for a car, for drugs and weapons. Education, regulation and meaningful enforcement, to keep dangerous things out of the hands of youth, who cannot give consent(due to their lack of experience).
<LI>drugs should only be used by those who can handle them.
<LI>where's the wine?  not everyone drinks only beer or hard liquor.  as for testing, some jobs should require IMPAIRMENT testing, but what one does in one's off hours is one's own business.
<LI>I believe that no government has the right to dictate what a person may or may not put into their own body. Obviously there are certain situations where it should be controlled (driving, surgeons operating, etc.), but apart from such specific instances, I believe that an individual should have the right to consume what they choose.
<LI>should keep separate responses on alcohol and marijuana from cocaine and crack
<LI>What one takes into their body is their business but they are responsible for the results.
<LI>Freedom of choice has to be based on clear information, and that has to be taught at an early age. Social use of soft drugs, such as marijuana is no worse than social use of alcohol. The problem with soft drugs is that society alienates a large number of people who are harming no-one but themselves. Alienated people feel less responsible for their actions in that society
<LI>Each to his own.  Disempower criminals.
<LI>Drugs reduce a person's ability.
<LI>Drugs should be controlled if their abuse leads to physical addiction, or severe
<LI>should legalize pot
<LI>End Prohibition of ALL drugs!!!  Possession or consumption of ANY substance by an ADULT is NOT a crime!!!  (They are NOT harming others!)
<LI>The addictive personalitiy was not dealt with here__that is the real problem
<LI>Not to be used in excess. Keep under control
<LI>They are needed sometimes under medical supervision.
<LI>Legalize everything, tax it, take the tax money and use it for drug education programs.  Give people the facts and let them make their own choices.  Legal and taxed drugs will be purer and cheaper than the same drugs when they are illegal.
<LI>There are some drugs (recreational) that could possibly be legalized w/out makor problems to society
<LI>I don't think that destructive drugs should be glamorized.There is such a thing as free will and people need to be held accountable for their own actions:  not some government, company or state.
<LI>There are no good or bad drugs.  Anything abused or not used in moderation can cause harmful side effects.

 <H1><P ALIGN=CENTER>Commerce on the Net</H1>


<H2><P ALIGN=CENTER>All Hype?  or  Hurry Up!</H2>

<H4>

<DD>
While the Internet market size debate continues, more and more businesses 
are appreciative of the fact that Internet commerce can no longer be ignored. 
A strong Internet presence is becoming more of an integral part of their 
regular marketing mix and a substantial piece of their budget. In addition,
more large and small companies as well as home-based businesses are investing 
significant amounts of time and money into what they hope will be a substantial 
return on their investments - - the Internet and it뇹 World Wide Web. 

Recently  adjusting their own study results, Nielson now concludes that 
approximately 19.4 million people are currently using the Internet. 
Although many sources disagree on specific growth rate figures, everyone 
seems to agree that the Internet is rapidly growing and recent figures rate 
this growth at between 51% and 63%. What seems to be exciting many industry 
watchers and players about the Internet is its capability of  supplying 
targeted advertising directly to prospects who not only need,  but actively 
seek out information from the ever-growing volume of resources available on 
the World Wide Web.  <P>

<DD>I뇼e been told by one Internet advertising rep that the Internet has become 
one of the most successful methods of utilizing many diverse marketing 
disciplines.  One can employ the Shotgun approach to advertising or the 
Rifle Shot approach along with Direct Marketing methods. Not only can an 
advertiser pinpoint his advertisements to his specific proepect audience, 
he can also instantly be available to the masses. WHO'S PAYING? Internet 
advertising expenditures, as expected, continues on an upswing, which, up 
until very recently, relied almost exclusively on inflated estimates of 
returns that promised to "boggle the mind. Individual business Web sites 
and Internet Service Providers account for more than a third of the total 
spending and are followed by computer related industries. WHO'S GETTING PAID?
The leading 16 ad-driven (supported) Web sites had an estimated ad revenue
of $6.6 million in March of this year alone! InfoSeek, a widely used search
engine, is credited for generating approximately $1.7 million of this followed 
by ZDNet's $856,000 and c/net's $555,000.

 <P>

<DD>So, what results do we see on the Targeted BUYER'S end of the equation? 
Having been bombarded personally with mail, e-mail and many other forms of 
excitement and hype, I decided it was probably best to get a "second opinion."  
I had my company conduct an independent national US study in order to get 
some real answers directly from these "targeted Internet users."  By going 
directly to the Internet users that businesses were directing much of their 
Internet presence and promotions to, I was able to make some startling 
discoveries about Internet commerce. In a quantified (random) survey of 1,246
qualified individuals and professional purchasers in business and government,
we found that there has already been a 12% increase in direct purchasing of
Internet promoted products and services. A significant increase over 1995 
figures, in fact, more products are selling directly off of current Internet
advertising and promotions then even predicted by much of the existing "hype." 
Additionally, the normal 20 day to 3 month "sales process" from more 
conventional promotions and advertising is being cut in as much as half. 
This was found to be the case in and outside of the computer related 
products and services currently available directly from the Internet 
although computer products and services accounted for over 67% of all 
commerce successfully conducted. We were also able to obtain details on 
media and marketing effectiveness in order to determine what Internet media, 
publications, services, and marketing strategies were acceptable to the 
target prospects giving additional credence to the development of the Code of Conduct
that marketers and publicists must adhere to even in this, the "Jetson's 
age."


 <P>

<DD>These significant figures go to show, perhaps, that those who have been 
or are now investing their time and money into their own Internet presence
and promotions are doing so at less risk than previously envisioned even by 
the Internet nay sayers and conservative analysts. Advertising on the 
Internet is growing in volume and complexity. Many new effectiveness methods 
are being developed almost on a daily basis as agencies and providers work 
out new revenue generating concepts for themselves. I have great faith that 
many of them will actually be of some benefit to their clients as well.  
We뇳l take up some of these new marketing methods and cover ways in which 
to ensure the old timers still can 늖et the most bang for their buck in 
future columns.  Till then, stay well and stay "tuned and online."

Comdedy?</I></H2>

<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_JOKE -->
<LI>i love ellen's show
<LI>Janeane Garofalo is the best commedian today. She's fresh, original, and totally honest. She ROCKS!!
<LI>I think ELLEN ROCKS..so what she is a lesbo,,,do you ask your friends what type of underware you are waring?...thats how personal this is...LET her BE.damn it..she is human...and the best CLEAN comic around.besides R0sie*
<LI>My favorite show is The Drew Carey Show.
<LI>I can't believe you didn't list All in the Family as a possibility for best sitcom.  Hell, it could also be listed for best drama, or for that matter, best T.V. show of all time.  Not only was it a pioneer for sitcoms by including many serious issues, and dealing with them dramatically, but it also commented on the state of who we were.
<LI>Ellen is excELLENent! 
<LI>Adam Sandler is great too!
<LI>Rosie O'Donnel is a very good uplifting show with good clean fun to up lift anyones life. Shes brought to day time something that was really needed. My hat off to her she's great!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Chris Elliott, Conan O'brien, Brian Reagan, SCTV, David Letterman, Janeane Garofalo, Hogan's Heroes, Red Dwarf, Howard Stern, Match Game 73-78, Jim Carrey, Drew Carrey, Munsters, Carry On movies, Beavis and Butthead, Mike Myers, Louis C.K., Monty Python, Beverly Hillbillies, ALL RULE!!!  Ellen and Smelly James SUCK!!!
<LI>Talk Soup is not quite a talk show, but it is reaaaallllly funny (to me) Jon (the host) ROCKS!
<LI>The funniest joke of all.....My salary!  I am an elementary teacher in Texas!
<LI>Left Out:Damon Wayans, Chris Rock, Mr.Bean and probably some others. The State must return to television and so must The Kids in the Hall (or at least another movie).
<LI>D. L. Hughly is a beast and he should do another standup.
<LI>George Carlin is the best Stand up comedian ever but Eddie Murphy is up there with him! 
<LI>Jonathan Winters is the master of them all.  Robin Williams blatantly ripped him off.  If you want to know who the greatest improvisational comedian of the all is, go get yourself some Jonathan Winters CDs or tapes.
<LI>ROWAN ATKINSON  is by Far the most talented Comedian Of all Time!  American humor stinks! let's face it, the only good TV shows in the USA are MST3K and The Simpsons.
<LI>WE LOVE MAD TV!!!! (ALSO, WE LOVE ROSIE O"DONNEL, oh, Orlando Jones on Mad TV is funny!)
<LI>Ellen is my favorite sitcom right now!!!
<LI>Favorite Comedian: Ellen DeGeneres; Favorite sitcom: Ellen!
<LI>JIM DAVID is one of the funniest unknowns working around the country. White TRash rules!
<LI>Gerry Swallow - best live stand-up; Pat Bullard - funniest current talk show host; Jon Stewart - funniest ex-talk show host.
<LI>The Daily Show is the funniest show I've seen in a very long time.
<LI>My absolute favorite sitcom is ofcourse "Ellen".  I love it!
<LI>Mystery Science Theater 3000
<LI>Elaine Boosler, Jeff Dunnum, 3rd Rock From the Sun
<LI>I love The Drew Carey Show and Mad About You
<LI>"Ellen" is usually pretty funny; I think Ellen DeGeneris is the Lucy of the '90's
<LI>Gerry Swallow, tonight show comedian, very funny guy, why not listed?
<LI>Gilda Radner in early Saturday Night Live was one of the best!!!
<LI>my favorite joke kind of thing was the telephone call to god one by Ellen DeGeneres
<LI>Howie Mandell is hysterical - I love him!
<LI>The Rosie O'Donnel show
<LI>I' m funny put me on your list!
<LI>Funniest male comic is Dane Cook, funniest female is Denise Burns.  Newsradio and Drew Carey are funniest sitcoms - and Dr. Katz is the funniest show on TV.  You didn't have a place for funniest female actress but it is Kathy Griffin on "Suddenly Susan" and this survey is very male dominated.
<LI>The greatest actor of all time is Kevin Kline because he started in Theatre before movies, so he knew how to affect the audiance. I think the same goes with sitcoms and stand up comedians, comedians are better when they start from scratch. The best show in the world is Saturday Night Live. All the shows not just one generation! Most of the Amazing comedians came from that show. Ex: Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Steve Martin, Dan Akroyd, David Spade, Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, Dana Carvey, and many others
who hosted and were a part of the SNL family.  I also think the British are very very very funny! If anyone would like to talk movies, acting or comedy write me at amccurdy@comland.com -Amy 
<LI>I dont have a joke in particular to tell, but my favorie types are the ones where something is left out, and figuring out the missing part is what makes it funny
<LI>ELLEN show should be on
<LI>Laurel and Hardy: the funniest of them all. Married..with Children: at its best, a viciously hilairious satire of American life.
<LI>MST3k! where is it?
<LI>ELLEN DEGENERES WHAT MORE CAN I SAY
<LI>fave sitcom -- Ellen
<LI>ADAM SANDLER
<LI>What did Jesus say to the abo's whilst hanging on the cross A. Dont do anything till I get back
<LI>I love Ellen's jokes!
<LI>Chris Rock!!!
<LI>I love Tom Rhodes and Jon Stewart.  Both of them are extremely talented and very yummy.  =)
<LI>Bewitched!!!!!
<LI>I like Night Stand. Monty Python was great. Original SNL, too.
<LI>Cybil and Mariann are tops.
<LI>Fav. situation comedy is "Ellen".
<LI>On the flip side,australia we have the comedy company and Fast forward.  I think both would do well in the U.S..
<LI>Ellen DeGeneres is the funniest comedian and her show Ellen is the best show on television and it is better than all those listed.
<LI>ANTHONY CLARK is the GREATEST!!  Watch BOSTON COMMON!!
<LI>Martin!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Rosie O'donnell is the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Hey, you left out The Rosie O'Donnell show for best talk show!
<LI>Jay Leno's delivery is the best (and it's within 30 minutes or it's free)
<LI>Best TV Sitcom = ELLEN!!!!!!
<LI>the entire Wayans family is hilarious.You need to upgrade your list of sitcoms.
<LI>You REALLY REALLY need to add Adam Sandler to the list.
<LI>I think Marsha Warfield (Roz on Night Court) should be added to the list of female comedians.
<LI>Denis Leary is really my favorite male comedian--you should put him on the list.  
<LI>The Rosie O'Donnel Show
<LI>Favourite comediens? Brian Regan and Suzanne Westenhoffer...the RULE
<LI>Why didn't you list "Ellen" same school as DVD
<LI>Mr. Bean rocks!
<LI>I think that Saturday Night Live, MAD TV, Royal Canadian Air Farce, are the best sketch comedy programs.  Rosie O'Donnel is the best talk show host and Cheri Oteri and Nicole Sullivan are the best sketch comedy actress'
<LI>When that guy, you know who I'm talking about, did something funny to that other guy
<LI>They were not funny! ha ha ha ha ha 
<LI>Absolutely Fabulous (British)
<LI>Ellen is the best show
<LI>Carol Burnett show is one of my favorites! Oh yeah, Rosie O'Donnells talk show is the best!
<LI>I like it when women whip out their boobs.  Its funny.
<LI>I'm British, so my favourite stand-up is a guy called Eddie Izzard, and my favourite sitcoms are "Blackadder", "Red Dwarf" and "The New Statesman", as well as "Frasier".
<LI>Danny Kaye, Jack Benny, Bob Hope, George Burns, Lucille Ball are the GREATEST comedians of the 20th century!!!
<LI>Rosie O'Donnel's talk show is about the best I've seen-daytime wise, that is.
<LI>Mike Moore and his show "T.V. Nation" is extremely funny. Good satire, my favorite.
<LI>I think Joesph Donato is a riot. Why has he not gotten a show? I don't know. Anyway Joseph is cutting edge, Dice style with Cosby class. Oh I have his real email address. it is( jdcomedian@earthlink.net ) I got it from somone home page, and he reply's.  Joseph keep up the good work buddy. Gee I went a bit long on this comment. oh well  Joseph Donato if you see this  do another show in Boston, Thanks: Craig L
<LI>Favorite comedian LUCILLE BALL
<LI>theres this chap and he chaps at this door and this chap answers the door and the chap who chapped at the door says," is yer granny in?" and the chap who answeed the chap at the door says, " no she's et arbroth" and th chap who chapped at the door says, "oh its all right tell her i'l come in and wait until she's finished" also, whats the commonest thing for someone in aberdeen to say after answering the door? - come away in, yel huv hud yer tea? 
<LI>Jason Alexander as George on Seinfeld is just about the most polished performance possible, totally excellent!
<LI>How did the Newfie break his leg raking leaves?  HE FELL OUT OF THE TREE.
<LI>Mad about you for sitcom
<LI>Ellen Degeneres is the best!
<LI>R.I.P. Bakersfield PD. So funny I laughed all the way through the adverts. Maybe it will follow in the footsteps of Police Squad and have three successful movies made out of it. British and Irish comedians are generally better than American (but then, I s
<LI>early Roseanne episodes were brillant - has since lost the plot however.
<LI>Drew Carey RULES!
<LI>BILL COSBY IN HIS EARLY 60S COMEDY ALBUMS WAS THE FUNNIEST 'STAND UP' I EVER HEARD.  MASH WAS THE BEST TOTAL SHOW, BUT SEINFELD IS THE FUNNIEST.
<LI>I think Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest and most talented comedians out there, even though some people may get easily offended by his jokes.  He doesn't mean any harm, but it's not exactly something I would go around repeating (ex: Raw).  I also think the TV show Friends is hilarious!
<LI>THE BEST MALE COMEDIAN IS MARTIN LAWRENCE ALL THE WAY.PUT HIM ON THTE LIST!
<LI>Three's Company is the best show of ALL TIME.
<LI>I think that you missed one of the most talented comedians I have seen - Rowan Atkinson is funny beyond belief because he possesses the ability to make some one laugh without saying a thing. He is probably best known for his Blackadder performance and his Mr Bean performance.  Very underated and very funny.  Also I feel that the Late Bill Hicks was hilarious as is Eddie Izzard.
<LI>Firesign Theatre, John Cleese (in anything), Gilda Radner, Comic Relief (the entire production, as well as the MC's--Crystal, Goldberg, and Williams), early sketches by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, CLASSIC improv by Nichols and May AND by Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner. movie parodies by Carol Burnett's ensemble.  
<LI>Drew Carey is by far THE funniest show on TV today.
<LI>Comedian: Louie Anderson very funny. 
<LI>Howard Stern
<LI>3rd rock 3rd rock 3rd rock!! Need I say more?
<LI>Ellen is the best sit-com on tv...
<LI>Drew Carrey <-- Funny.  Adam Sandler <-- Not.  Fran Drescher <-- Funny.  Ellen the Degenerate <-- not.  Denis Leary <-- funny and insightful.  Sam Kinnison <-- funny and irreverent and dead.  Howard Stern <-- funny and innovative.  Rosie O'D <-- talk show is good.  Spalding Gray <-- Could and Should have Talk Show.  Garrison K. <-- Funny, but an acquired taste.  Tom and Ray <-- Damn funny (and about cars!).  Robin Williams <-- has been.  Steve Martin <-- now more of a straight man.  Lily Thomlin <-- Pi
neer.  Jay Ward Cartoons <-- Brilliant.  Little Rascals <-- Still funny 70 years later.  "Who's on First?" <-- Greatest Routine ever written.
<LI>Janeane Garofalo rules as female comedian!
<LI>I don't remember his last name but the guy whose Eddie on that new show Malcolm and Eddie. His stand up is hilarious. Also Bill Bellamy (you survey seems to omit a lot of the young black comics :( )  Margret Chong is also very funny.
<LI>One of my favorite comediennes is Kathy Buckley(I believe this is how she spells her name)
<LI>There really was no way to choose on many of the first questions. My all-time favorite show has to be Mystery Science Theater 3000. It employs a writing staff that keeps the laughs coming and I love to "rank" on bad movies <G>.
<LI>Your choices suck. You Americans don't know what comedy is.
<LI>Sam Kinison was the ultimate king of standup comedy, and nobody will ever come close to emmulating his persona
<LI>Miss Kitty was walking down Dodge's street by the livery stable, saw a light thru a wall crack and looked in.  Chester had a shovel of warm horse manure held by his crotch with his pants down.  He was excited.  Miss Kitty steped it, raised her dress and said "Chester, why don't you just put it in here?"  He replyed "THE WHOLE SHOVELFULL MISS KITTY?"     
<LI>Denis Leary is the ultimate comedian.  No one is more honest in such a hysterical way.  He's is a great actor as well!!  
<LI>check your spelling; it IS important sometimes ... Pryor ... O'Donnell, others
<LI>Adam Sandler is a great, funny actor and should be included!!
<LI>Rosie O'Donnell has the best talk show on t.v.
<LI>Danny Kaye is still the master; I defy any modern male comics to perform at his level!
<LI>Ellen as favorite sit-com
<LI>I LOVE ROSIE! 
<LI>favorite comedy show - Ellen
<LI>Bob Hope.  Comedy does not have to be filthy to be funny.
<LI>Third Rock from the Sun is the Best!
<LI>Three's Company is THE BEST!
<LI>Leslie Nielson is one of the best!  And Jay Leno get s high marks for fresh humor that spoofs the current sad situation in the U.S.
<LI>Hey..you left out America's foremost comedic bard..Howard Stern
<LI>Drew Carey show is the funniest on TV today
<LI>OUR LOCAL PBS GETS BRITISH COMEDIES.  HILARIOUS!  ONLY COMEDY THAT MAKES ME LAUGH OUT LOUD WHEN I'M BY MYSELF.
<LI>ELLEN should be listed in the sitcom list it's the best.I look forward to it every week!
<LI>ELLEN should be listed in the sitcom list it's the best. Il
<LI>The all-time funniest show ever on TV is "The Honeymooners", by a factor of about a thousand. Of the shows currently on the air, none of them really break me up because they're written by morons for morons; however "The Nanny" occasionally blunders into something slightly amusing by accident.
<LI>I think Ed Wynn was one of the all-time great comedians, but I enjoyed even more the dramatic work he did.  I think two of his finest performances were in "Anne Frank: Diary of a Young Girl" and Rod Serling's masterpiece "Requiem for a Heavyweight." I hope you agree.
<LI>The best sitcom was "Three's Company" hands down!
<LI>Where are Gallager, Adam Sandler, and Carrot Top?? Just wondering!! =P
<LI>Are You Being Served?, next to Monty Python's Flying Circus, is the best British comedy ever
<LI>I enjoy Jerry Seinfeld in the sit-com much more than his stand-up routine.
<LI>George Carlin may be my favorite stand-up comedian, but he can't act worth beans and I'm glad he doesn't have his own show anymore.
<LI>What's little yellow and you can jump on it?   A baby duck!!!!
<LI>Abott & Costello will live on forever.  But they need some TV time to get remembered.
<LI>Two priests walk into a bar.... With all of the times this joke has been told, by this time you would have thought that they would have seen it.
<LI>Rosie O'Donel is my favorite TV Talk Show
<LI>BENNY HILL!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Put Adam Sandler in your list of comedians because he rules
<LI>Jim Carrey is a one trick pony, and i've seen the trick.  He can now go to France and be hailed as the second coming of Jerry Lewis.
<LI>KINISON LIVES!!!!
<LI>Married with Children, Wings
<LI>The Election
<LI>Jerry Seinfeld is the funniest comedian since Steve Martin in the early eighties.
<LI>I know what you're thinking, Steve when do you find time to juggle?
<LI>If you do not agree that Monty Python kicks ass, I shall say "Ni!" to you until you bring me a shrubbery and cut down the mightiest tree in the forest with this herring!!!
<LI>simpsons is the best. rowan atkinson.
<LI>3rd Rock from the Sun, Cybil
<LI>The Firesign Theatre is the best of all.  Too bad they don't get enough exposure!
<LI>Ellen Degeneres  ABC's Ellen the show
<LI> you should add ellen to the list of sitcoms genius
<LI>Brett Butler is pretty funny.  Kinda raunchy, but, then again, so am I.
<LI>Red Skelton is the greatest comedian of all time!!
<LI>Ellen DeGeneres is THE BEST!! She should be on all the categories. Go Ellen, go!
<LI>I just love Ellen and Rosie o'donnell, they are the best women comedians around, would like to see more of them!!
<LI>I just love Ellen and Rosie o'donnell, they are the best women comedians around, would like to see more of them!!
<LI>Computer geek jokes
<LI>You must include Rosie O'Donnell's show in talk show category....she is by far THE best!!!!
<LI>just dont forget John Candy!!! (especially in Planes Tranes and Automobiles with Steve MArtin)
<LI>OH MY GOODNESS!  Why don't you NOT have Ellen on the list for favorite Shows.  She SO, so so so so so so so funny.  She was also really funny in Mr. Wrong.  Ellen Degeneres is the supreme ruler of comedy, no else even compares.  Thanks, Loree
<LI>#5.  Why are there only male comedians listed??  #4. Rosie O'Donell Show
<LI>Bob Newhart and Stan Frieberg should get a mention here somewhere!  -- Joke: How many Right Wing Fundamentalists does it take to change a lightbulb?   Give-up?   Answer:  ???!!!!???Change???!!!???
<LI>sinbad is the funnest comedian I've ever seen. what do winnie the pooh and john the bapist have in common? they have the same middle name! middle name being "the"
<LI>Adam Sandler ROCKS so stop looking at me swan!!!
<LI>Denis Leary--He tells it like it is and the way things SHOULD be.
<LI>Ellen Degeneres is the funniest comedian to ever walk the face of the earth!!!!!!  Her show is awesome and her book rocks the house!!!!!!
<LI>Adam Sandler is the most under-rated comedian today.
<LI>"Married with Children"
<LI>LIFE IS TOO SERIOUS WE NEED COMEDY
<LI>What about MST3K???!!!
<LI>My favorite comedy is british comedy. American comedy is a pale imitation
<LI>Drew Carey and his show. Cohost MIMI
<LI>you're listings are skimpy
<LI>Canadian Air Farce is my favourite comedy show on TV. But maybe it hasnt made it to the US yet.
<LI>I loved the "original" Bob Newhart Show
<LI>You forgot Drew Carey!
<LI>I know some people write in suggesting comedians such as Adam Sandler,etc.  But really...how could you leave out Gary Shandling.  He is an experienced, well-known comedian, who's show 'It's Gary Shandling's Show' was surprisingly like the later created Seinfeld (some coincidence huh?).  He's done award shows and stand-up, and is up there with Richard Pryor.  U even included Larry Sanders Show, but not Gary?
<LI>The Simpsons!
<LI>The Simpsons should be included; it is the best comedy series EVER.  Jake Johannsen should be on the list of male standups.
<LI>Rosie O'Donnell Show
<LI>Please add the Rosie O'Donnell show to the comedy talk show list.
<LI>There are alot of funny comedians out there, it is hard to choose a favorite. But I enjoy Rosie o'Donnel, Ellen D. Meg Ryan,John Candy,( sad that he is gone) Tim Allen, I perferr comedy over anything else.
<LI>Ellen is the best show ever!!!
<LI>Where's Rosie O'Donnell for talk show?
<LI>none
<LI>MARGARET CHO IS THE BEST FEMALE COMEDIAN
<LI>Let me say that it is unbelievable that Howard Stern has been left off the list.  Many don't like him but many of those same people have not heard him.  If you are truly a comedy fan then give Howard Stern a chance.  Listen close for one week and then tell me if he is not the funniest man in the world.  Do it.  I challenge you.
<LI>Ellen rules!!!
<LI>Wildly stupid survey - there's no women listed for favorite comedy actor today.  Why no women's talk-shows?  What's the use eh?
<LI>I want to vote the Rosie O'Donnell show for best talk show.
<LI>Ellen is the best show on the face of the earth
<LI>  "Soap"   should have been on the list!
<LI>#6 - Home Improvement and Ellen
<LI>Also really like Brett Butler!
<LI>Jackie Gleason & Red Skelton
<LI>Benny Hill, Rest in Peace.
<LI>Brian Regan is the besT!
<LI>You forgot Tom Rhodes man, just thought you might want to since he's got his own show and is like cool to the nth power.
<LI>I didn't see Gallagher's name!!
<LI> If a Santa Claus, a smart blond and a dumb blond jumped off a cliff which one do you think would land first? The dumb blond because neither of the other exist.
<LI>There wasa female standup comedian (I couldn't remember her name or  I'd have voted for her), who came up with the following> I had a friend once who was in labor for 36 hours. I don't  even want to do anything I like for 36 hours.
<LI>Ellen as favorite show
<LI>Rosie O'Donnell is the best talk show, and Ellen is the best sitcom--best things to ever happen to american pop culture
<LI>I've followed Drew Carey and Louie Anderson for years and I think they're AMAZING!!!!!

<LI>IF YOU GET A CHANCE, GET A HOLD OF A WHOOPI GOLBERG STAND UP VIDEO - ITS WORTH IT 
<LI>CAROL BURNETTE 
<LI>The young ones rule they are  soooo funny ha ha
<LI>Jim Carrey/Elaine Boosler/Friends

<LI>Sorry you omitted Don Rickles - He's the best!
<LI>You left out Howard Stern and his E! show on the list...
<LI>Ellen Degener
<LI>Watch Drew Carey (for Mimi) and Ellen every week without fail.  Both shows are entertaining, funny, and can be very real life!  Let's make sure we keep them on the air for a while.
<LI>Why is Clinton in the White House?...We're all still stoned!!
<LI>Jim Carrey RULES, he is like a god...
<LI>Steven Pearl
<LI>Ellen DeGeneres is THE funniest comedian in the world and always will be! Anyone who thinks differently is a drinker.  :)
<LI>Absolutely Fabulous on BBC/Comedy Central is very funny and makes a great drinking game: Drink whenever someone says "sweetie" or "darling". Finish your drink if anyone says "fabulous".
<LI>You have to put Jim Carrey into the comedy movie actor section.
<LI>Mark Lowry
<LI>Ellen Degeneres is a breath of fresh air.  She makes Wednesday nights something to look forward to on her show Ellen.  Thanks!
<LI>I think you need to add ELLEN to the list of best comedy sit-coms.
<LI>Mr. Bean gets NO respect.
<LI>Male - Larry Miller; Show - Mad about You
<LI>Curly Howard and the other Stooges are by far the funniest ever!!!!
<LI>i love drew carey, third rock.
<LI>Ellen Rules
<LI>I know they aren't as popular now, but musical comedy is great also (Tom Lerher)
<LI>You're missing all my favorite sitcoms!  How about the Burns and Allen Show?  A classic!  Or what about the Odd Couple?  STILL cracks me up after zillions of viewings! Others worthy of mention:  Car 54, The Honeymooners, The Jack Benny Program-- oh! What about Taxi!  Simply masterful!
<LI>Sinbad - GREAT!  Needs help on his acting, but has potential.
<LI>My favorite show/sitcom is Barney Miller
<LI>Fraiser- I love that show!  David Hyde Pierce is the best!
<LI>Rosie O'Donell has the funniest and best talk show on television today.
<LI>Is Seinfeild really funny? I don't think so.
<LI>You overlooked Brett Butler... her stand-up is incredible!!! :)
<LI>Ellen is not on your list for show/sitcom. I also think you should include the dana carvey show. it rocked!
<LI>id vote for robin williams for best male commedian if you had that option.
<LI>GERRY SWALLOW ROCKS!
<LI>You guys ought to add Bobby Collins and Larry Reeb to your favorite comics list.  Those two guys are hysterical!
<LI>drew carey show and tgif
<LI>The Louie Anderson Show was super..too bad it was cancelled.
<LI>The Simpsons, HOW could you forget THE SIMPSONS!! Cartoons should never be neglected as a form of comedic entertainment for young and old veiwers alike!!! Animaniacs! Looney Toons! But definetely NOT Disney.
<LI>Favorite sitcom - Ellen....favorite comedian - Ellen......Go Ellen, go ellen, go ellen........
<LI>For Stand -up you forgot Gallagher & Howie Mandell. As for shows  You need to have Drew Carrey. A joke huh?  What is the difference between a good year and a great year?     One is a tire the other is 365 condoms!
<LI>As far as stand-up goes, the KING is Steve Martin.  Insightful, silly, witty and at times, just plain stupid.  He had it all.
<LI>Third Rock From the Sun;  Riddle "What was the movie on TWA flight 800?"  Answer:  "Forget Paris"
<LI>Larry Miller is the funniest.. His first time skiing story was incredible 1 hour special oon hbo, as well as his stages of drinking..
<LI>Ellen DeGeneres Show should be on the list!
<LI>I think Adam Sandler is the all time funniest and should be put on this list! Thanks!!
<LI>I believe Taxi to be one of the greatest comedy shows ever and Christopher lloyd as Jim is an absolute marvel
<LI>Sinbad? No way what a loser. Sam Kinneson, by far is the best. I'm sick of all the complaining twits about vulagr humor, grow up poopie heads
<LI>Bill Irwin great physical clowning
<LI>Fresh Prince of Bel Air. He is the best and Will Smith is realy funny. But he can't dance.
<LI>Ellen DeGeneres. I think she is the most funniest woman in on TV and she is the funniest women I ever seen. She is so cool. I want to be just like her.
<LI>sitcom "Ellen"
<LI>One of my favorite shows is Dennis Miller on HBO.  The only problem I have with the show is his gratuitous use of foul language.  He was so funny on Saturday Night Live and does not need four letter words to be funny.  007
<LI>Ellen DeGeneres by a country mile.  The best comedian and the best sitcom.  Go win the Emmy Ellen!
<LI>Ellen DeGeneres is the most masterful comedianne in the industry because she gets the audience to visualize and feel what she's talking about and then the audience in turn finds it hilarious.  Did that just make any sense?
<LI>Stand up male: RICHARD PRYOR;  THE best ever!!!
<LI>Ellen is the best sitcom on TV.
<LI>Woody Harrelson should be in the male actors list.
<LI>Alexi Sayle (of "Stuff") is far funnier than most of the American sitcoms.
<LI>Howard Stern is the KING OF ALL MEDIA!!!!!
<LI>Janeane Garafolo
<LI>William Shakespear, "I just peed my pants and there is nothing anyone can do about it"
<LI>Fav comedian is Gallagher, only the first half of the MASH episodes were funny, it got too political and silly around just before RADAR left.  The movie was good.
<LI>Best comedy team is Robin Williams and Jonathan Winters. Saw then together on a late night talk show and never PIMP so much in my life!
<LI>The Rosie O'Donnall show is the best show on TV (besides Party of Five)
<LI>What about Adam Sandler
<LI>Adam Ferarra is a very funny new comedian. Also there is a woman who is hilarious that uses "subliminal" messages in her act... Who is she?
<LI>I think TAXI was one of the best comedy shows
<LI>best female/male sidekick
<LI>Paula Poundstone; Rita Rudner; Judy Tenuta and Roseanne are all gr8 too!  I also think Julie Kavner is sheer genius.
<LI>Hey!  Where are The Simpsons???  They're comedy too!!!
<LI>Fawlty Towers and Absolutely Fabulous are great BBC Comedies.
<LI>Ni!  (Eckee, eckee, eckee, ptang! Voom, Boing!!!)
<LI>favourite sit-com: Married with Children
<LI>There was an engineer and a computer programmer on an airplane. The computer programmer wanted to play a game. "Tell you what," he said to the engineer, "If you can come up with a riddle I can't answer, I'll pay you $50. If you can come up with a riddle I
<LI>Australian comedy called "Fast Forward"
<LI>Red Skelton - 40's & 50's
<LI>Three's Company is defenitely one of my favorite comedy shows.
<LI>Brett Butler - Grace Under Fire - the absolute best - her sarcastic wit and ribald humor make the show, and her stand up comedy routines, fantastic
<LI>shevonne durkin is just starting out as a stand-up.  Keep your eyes open for her.
<LI>I was having a bad day so I went to a bar and asked for a double and the guy went in the back and brought out someone who looked just like me
<LI>i really liked roseann untill saw her outside of her show interviews ect.
<LI>Please include TAXI on the sit com list!
<LI>I'm a die-hard George Carlin fan - but I like all comedy.  Laughter is medicine for the soul.  I think you missed one person who at least deserves recognition for his talents, which includes comedy - Tom Hanks.  Used to love Roseanne until she got too cocky; she's not even funny anymore.  I love John Goodman.  You missed him, too.  Let's give credit to the old Saturday Night Live people especially Gilda Radner (Roseanne-Roseanna-Danna).  What a legend.  Brett Butler is definitely funnier than Roseanne.
 And Jeff Foxworthy - the great, but I AM a redneck!  How come us "rednecks" don't consider his jokes prejudice as some minorities.  Arsenio, you're gone - you got Racist on us.  Sinbad...keep up the great job.
<LI>My favorite joke:  Ok.  Arnold Shwaraneggar has a big one, George Bush has a small one, Madonna doesn't have one, and the Pope has one, but can't use it.  What is it?????  A LAST NAME!!!!!
<LI>Danny Kaye ROCKS!  
<LI>Another great comedian would be Denis Leary!
<LI>Coach!  Great show and of course there is always MArried with Children
<LI>WKRP
<LI>Actually, just a general comment... it is getting kind of disturbing how many comedians are being used as vehicles for talk show and/or sitcoms (and vice versa).  Especially when the name of the show is the name of the performer....
<LI>My favorite comedian is David Spade. My favorite movies are Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, and The Coneheads.
<LI>cosby show, Bill Cosby when he told theo about how hard it is to live on your on
<LI>Thanks... Rosie is AWESOME in her new show!

<LI>Put UK comedian Alexei Sayle on US television!
<LI>what happened to the Monty Python crew, they are some the best comediens in the world
<LI>Mort Sahl for standup;  Ernie Kovacks for all-round comic talent
<LI>I think the funniest situation comedy show of all time was All in the Family and the funniest comedy show still running is Benny Hill 
<LI>Full Frontal Comedy on HBO is a great show!!
<LI>I love the Chris Farley/David Spade duo
<LI>We love Ellen Degeneres and her show Ellen.  Can't believe you left her show out of your survey!!!!!!!!!!!!

<LI>It was a sad, sad day when Bill Hicks passed away.  One less prat to worry about (so he would say).
<LI>I think each generation has it's share of "great" comedians. 
<LI>ADAM SANDLER, CHRIS FARLEY, and 
<LI>My favorite joke:  Two little boys decide to learn to swear.  The older brother says, " I'll say hell & you say ass."  "OK" says the little brother, Just then their mother comes in and says, "Good morning boys.  What do you want for breakfast?"  The older brother says,"Aw hell, give me some Cheerios."  The mother is so shocked, she smacks him in the mouth & sends him crying to his room.  She then says to the little one, "And what do you want?"  To which he replied, "I don't know, ... but you can bet yo
r ass it won't be Cheerios!"
<LI>Roseanne beats everybody
<LI>Joseph Donato is the best comic these days, he gets to the point and we all had fun at his show. He's clean and harsh in the same sense. You have to see or hear him to have the laugh of your life. JD YOU ARE THE BESTEST <---as you would say PEACE
<LI>The Gaseous Wiener rules!
<LI>Dennis Miller very intellegent and funny.  Rosie's new show is great.  I like that she is not tring to be David Lettermen and is just being herself.

<LI>Ellen Degeneres is a goddess!
<LI>FAVORITE SITCOM:  ELLEN 
<LI>"Red Dwarf" and "Are You Being Served?" should be added to list of comedy shows!

<LI>Ellen is my favourite comedian - and my favorite joke is: Why did the chicken stop in the middle of the road?  Because it had a coffee table tied to it's leg!!
<LI>most comedy talk shows these days aren't very funny at all
<LI>Brit-coms are the best. Especially Red Dwarf and Blackadder.

<LI>The Drew Carey show is the best of the new sitcoms

<LI>Q: ow many republicans does it take to change a lightbulb?  A: Before addressing this issue let me say unequivocably that we republicans had nothing to do with the lights going out; we're inclined to correct the democrats mistakes, as long as everyone is aware that it's entirely their fault, and by the way, this will require an additional $7 Trillion defense budget so we can protect the national security of our bulb manufacturing resources.

Only takes one....he's still pulling.....................so long!!

<LI>Adam Sandeler(sp?) rules!
<LI>Brett Butler is my favorite female comedian.
<LI>The Best Comedie show on tv is The Rosie O' Donnel Show!

<LI>Your list of comics is totally lame. One of them is even dead. None of my favorites (or anyone who's become known in the last 5 years) is on the list. Jake Johansen should be on there.

<LI>Sinbad, Phil Hartman, Greg Kinnear, Best Show- Newsradio
<LI>All in the Family - easily the funniest sitcom ever!

<LI>What do you call a dog with no legs?    - Doesn't matter, he won't come anyway.
<LI>Dennis Miller is the BEST! He's funny, but on the serious issues I totally agree with everything! For example, if there comes a time when you feel your only outlet is to kill or molest a kid, it's time to commit suicide!

<LI>The Drew Carey show is pretty good too!

<LI>Paul Reiser and _Mad About You_ should definately be among these choices.
<LI>Tim Cavanaugh ("99 Dead Baboons") performance was one of the best I've been too. You should try to hear his parody on "Proud Mary" about the Christmas story. Bob Rivers Comedy Group and Capital Steps produce some great comedy songs, too.
<LI>Elen DeGenres

<LI>Bobcat Golthwait

<LI>Comedy today mostly needs to be cleaned up
<LI>Prairie Home Companion (Radio!) is the best comedy today.
<LI>Monty Python, by far . . .
<LI>Bill Clinton - What a Joke!
<LI>Martin Lawerence is the SHIT!
<LI>One word - Taxi

<LI>My favorite entertainment is stand-up comedy.  In the last 8 years I have only missed 10 shows in a local club that has shows weekly and for 4 and 1/2 years the shows were twice a week.  Laughing is the best form of therapy in a very serious, frustrating existence.
<LI>male standup: Robin Williams; female standup: Brett Butler; comedy venue:Comic Theatre/Vaudeville; Comedy Troupe: The Flying Karamazov Brothers;

<LI>Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie - damn fine tv show in canada (only 5 episodes aired)
<LI>The Drew Carey Show
<LI>The Dick Van Dyke Show and Dick Van Dyke, The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Mary Tyler Moore--HOW COULD YOU LEAVE THESE TWO OUT???
<LI>Suzanne Westenhoeffer
<LI>John Candy was one of the finest comic actors of this generation.  He should be recognized here somewhere.

<LI>Rhett Butler
<LI>ELLEN is my fave sitcom
<LI>The vast majority of current comedians are insulting and boorish rather than funny. 
<LI>The top ten male comics are funnier than any of the female comics on the list
<LI>I particularly enjoy improvisational comedy, the cutting edge of comedy in my opinion.  Shows like "Who's Line Is it Anyway?" are just the beginning.  Second City shows, The Groundlings and Monks' Night Out are the future of comedy.
<LI>ought to include bill cosby
<LI>Howard Stern's Morning Radio Show is excellent !!!!!
<LI>My favorite female comedienne is Brett Butler
<LI>i think you should add gallagher to the list!!!!!
<LI>Frasier would have to be about the most intelectually stimulating comdey entertainment we've watched....period.
<LI>I like Janeane Garofalo.
<LI>John Candy was/is my favorite...no one can replace his humanity
<LI>the carol burnette show and all in the family were the best
<LI>It wouldn't fit.

<H2 align=CENTER>What are your thoughts on drugs/drug usage?</H2>

<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_DRUGS -->
<LI>Drugs can really mess up a person's life.  I have seen my friends become consumed by drugs.  they are powerful and scary.  Education and limitations are the key to keeping society off drugs.
<LI>Illicit substances should be decriminalized 1)to restore individual sovereignty over one's own body; 2) to free the American people from the civil rights violations that are collateral damage of the War on Drugs; 3) to take the profits out of gang and organized crime, thereby making the streets safer; and 4) to free government resources (tax dollars, prison space, agents) for other purposes or abolition.
<LI>I feel drugs are playing a large part in the destruction of human life.
<LI>Any one who indulges in any form of mind altering substances has a problem facing life.
<LI>This should be a personal, not social issue.  There should be no loss of responsibility for one's actions, but there should no arbitrary limits imposed on individual liberty to live one's life as one chooses.
<LI>Drugs and drug usage is something that should be hought about by each individual.  Abuse can lead to problems.
<LI>Controlled substances are "controlled" for good reasons.  I could understand why marijuana might be legalized, but others should remain illegal for possession and use.  There are too many other worthwhile needs to devote our time to instead of getting high (or drunk).  It is a form of selfishness.  I am referring to repeated acts, not an isolated incident.  One of the problems with drugs is that they lead to repeated acts of getting high; wasted time that could be better spent doing something helpful.
<LI>I do not smoke, drink or take drugs but yet I think that they should be legalized.
<LI>The government war on drugs is a big waste of time effort and especially tax money. Make it all legal but educate people to the bad effects of all these things along with the bad effects of too much food, toomuch sleep, too much illicit sex, driving too f
<LI>OK as long as it isn't excessive & doesn't hinder your life or goals.
<LI>While I have addiction problems, I am for legalizing drugs and treating people when problems develope
<LI>Unfortunately drugs(new and old, i.e. plants) have been around as long or longer than man has.  Us humans have always liked the affect certain substances have on our senses.  Drugs will never go away and trying to destroy the plants that are necessary to create them is useless.  It all comes back to control of whats out there and teaching self-control (Mom and Dad!).  Even with stricter control there will be those to slip through the cracks.
<LI>Any substance can be abused.  I don't think we need more legal ways to destroy your bodies and those around us.  Responsible use of substances - legal or illegal begin with education in the home.  A strong family unit will solve many of the current problems with drugs, teenage pregnancy, and violence.  
<LI>Legalize drugs, but provide better treatment and education to take care of problems.
<LI>Drug use is used as an excuse for social problems and
<LI>Educate, don't get started, get a life (find real happiness), I don't want to see any government law prohibiting or wealfare like support - If a person uses drugs, they had better be able to EARN (family) income, or rely on charity existance (or die).  If drug users violate the "peace" of others, they should end up in state prison.
<LI>Drugs ruined my family. I now take care of my 6, 4, & 3 year olds alone. I have never tried illegal drugs (only perscription medication). I have never been drunk. I am a single father.
<LI>IIt is my judgement that people should be allowed to do what they want as long as it does not interfere with my rights.  If they wish to change their perception of reality with chemicals that is their business.
<LI>People need to lighten up.  Drugs have been here forever and regulating them simply creates crime and violence.
<LI>drungs are a way to enhance the human experience and find a bit of bliss while getting through this tough life.  we don't, however  want to fall into a Brave New World type of senario
<LI>Moderation is the key
<LI>Neither Prohibition nor Legalization tackles the issues as to why people turn to drugs in the first place.   I used to smoke most heavily when under stress.  Perhaps if people had better coping skills, they wouldn't turn to drugs for escape or psuedo self-esteem.
<LI>all natural drugs should be legalized,no chemicals
<LI>I think it's a personal decision.  What's right & appropriate for one person may not be for another.  I think there should be more realistic drug/alcohol education for pre-teenagers.
<LI>It's not as good as it seems at first.
<LI>A person who wants to alter their reality will find a way to do it whether it is legal or not.  If they do not harm anyone when they do it , then it should not make them a criminal to alter their reality.
<LI>Anyone who could control it is able to consume drugs. But you must reduce when you recognize it's getting out of control !
<LI>drugs are not the problem in today's society, human nature is the problem.  people will still destroy the planet and their chances soon, with or wothout drugs.
<LI>What a person chooses to put into their own body should be a personal matter. The idea that those who choose to use certain substances should be branded "criminal" is obscene. So long as you harm no other person, you should be free to do whatever you wish with your own body.
<LI>The government should be the only legal source of drugs. If a user wants to get high, they should stay in a facility (like a drug hotel, at their expense) until the effects wear off.
<LI>Drug usage is a huge problem which must be dealt with because it is getting out of control.
<LI>It's covered in 16, much better education thorugh more routes
<LI>People cause problems, drugs do not, some people cause problems only on drugs, these people should be dealt with and given FAIR and due process if need be.
<LI>Prohibition causes violence. We saw it with alcohol prohibition, we see it with drug prohibition. The illegality of most relatively safe recreational drugs has lead to increased violence, death due to poor quality control, and experimenting with more and more dangerous drugs that haven't been banned yet.
<LI>Along with alchol, pot and hash should be legalized
<LI>All drugs should be legalized but those using them do so at their own risk. No help from the taxpayers if they get in over their heads.
<LI>I feel that marijuana should be legalised although adolescents should be educated about its effects as to make an informed decision.
<LI>You didn't place many options in your answers for ex-addicts such as myself.  Drugs are generally life-sucking, and should be dealt with as a health problem rather than a crime.  It hasn't worked so far, so legalize and make treatment very available.  Social pressure should eventually take care of the rest.
<LI>I think drugs such as coccain and crack are extremly dangerous to our society and that legalizing mmarijuana would greatly reduce the use of then
<LI>I believe that what I do in Privacy of my own home is my business and no one elses as long as I am harming no one but myself. It should be MY choice.
<LI>Dude, all the shit I do is good for the mind. I am stress free.
<LI>The government does not have the right to determine what drugs I am allowed to take. All chemical substances cause harm to the body in varying degrees, and it should be the owner of the body making that choice, not some elected official.
<LI>Alcohol abuse is a major problem, as are street drugs.  I understand that today Marijuana is far more potent than when I was young (late 60s), but  I think that we should seriously consider legalizing at least a mild form of marijuana.  I'm quite "anti" other drugs.  
<LI>A waste of your life and everyone around you's energy.
<LI>Drugs just make you function in a dream world.  They may seem to help at that time but they really just put off what needs to be done and the abuse of any controlled substance hurts those around you.
<LI>i feel what you do to your body is your problem, but you must take charge of it yourself, not go to others for help
<LI>Why do people like or need drugs. Once we know the answer to that we can fight the problem in a different way.
<LI>Interesting, yet common tie up of alcohol and drugs. yes both are very similar, except one key fact. alcohol is legal drugs arent, in my case this is a strong factor in why i dont do drugs, yet i do do alcohol
<LI>Too much emphasis on staying away from illegal drugs while many corporate interests profit from "legal" drugs.  Banning usage does not prevent demand.  People will still experiment and use.  Education (non-biased) does prevent usage.
<LI>IT DESTROYS
<LI>Each adult shouild make the decision for him/herself.
<LI>I think that all drugs should be available in tightly controlled state-run stores
<LI>I have a NOVEL solution for eliminating the importation of cocaine/heroin/pot: genetically engineer a "bug" (virus, bacteria, insect, etc.) to eat the source plants!  The "bugs" could automatically die when their job was done, and the producer countries would be POWERLESS to stop them!
<LI>I think by legalizing drugs you will cut down on the crime that is rooted in drugs.  You will cut out the gangsters power, get rid of the mophia control, and straighten out a lot of crooked polticians.  These are the people who benfit from drug sales and distrubtion.  By legalizing it and taxing it you will better America.
<LI>Human animals enjoy alteered states of perception.  Whether a child spinning in circles to get dizzy or a latino enjoying the expresso 'buzz'  Criminalizing 'normal' behavior for temperence reasons shows how far in understanding of our being, we have evolved :).
<LI>It's sad that people abuse drugs.
<LI>Concerned about the escallation of drug usage.
<LI>test test test
<LI>Turning to drugs is shallow and a sign of weakness, but we have a right to be weak when we want to be weak.  Gvtmnt's responsibility is not to protect an individual from himself, but to protect him from being violated by others.
<LI>I think that all of the problems in our society eventually link to drug and alchohol abuse.  I think that if we try to control this problem, we will see improvements in things such as family life and violence.
<LI>I'm glad I tripped, but the other garbage did a lot of damage.
<LI>We could get rid of a lot of violence if certain drugs were legalized.  The government could probably pay off the national debt with these revenues.
<LI>I will not use drugs, but if you want to I would try stop you.
<LI>I tink that drug abuse is an ongoing and rapidly growing problem in the United States.  I personally have never had a drug or alchoholproblem but I know of young adults that do.  This area needs to be adressed in order to get the USA back on track
<LI>I suppose it comes down to common sense and moderation.  If you have the type of personality that likes to "escape" you'll use anything.. glue, rubbing alcohol, etc...  
<LI>Marijuana should probably be legalized and taxed other drugs and alcohol need stiifer penalties when used in life threatening situation ie. driving cocaine and harder drugs major penalties for use and dealing
<LI>Everything in moderation or experimentation is not likely to produce a problem for a person.  Drug and alcohol experimentation as well as other forms of experimentation are a natural, healthy part of the growth process.  Only when it drug or alcohol usage invades upon the individuals daily life and the life of others do drugs become a problem.  Some of the questions in the survey leave little room for accurate answers.  I drink beer because I love quality brews.  I drink hard alcohols or wine for the f
avor.  The effects from alcohol can make me giddy and sociable.  Alcohol can also make me tired and my digestion and overall feeling of well being can be diminished form a night of too much or drinking too often.  Marijuana is a relaxing, fun, spiritual, sharing drug that far surpasses alcohol in its qualities.  I feel that organic drugs result in less strain on the body and mind.  Soft drugs should be legalized.  Hemp should be legalized for its industrial purposes and save some of our forests from being 
hopped down for paper. 
<LI>All hard drugs should be banned from the US., But I think adults should be able to legally buy marijuana!
<LI>It annoys me that marijuana is illegal while nicotine and alcohol remain legal. On the other hand, I believe in an individual's right to destroy his or her own body and live his/her life the way he/she chooses--provided it doesn't affect my ability to liv
<LI>Nothing changes, governments will always want to restrict their citizens freedoms.  Temporarily drug use is restricted, give it 500 years and something else will be restricted instead.  Stupid life, huh?
<LI>The war on drugs cannot be won under any circumstances, the War is what keeps the prices and demand artificially high.  The government has not declared a war on drugs but a war on it's people.  The war is big business with mega-profit as incentive to continue the war. It's time to end the war on drugs.  How about a peace on drugs, use education to teach the truth and then let the user choose. The war is being lost because as soon as you try pot for the first time, you know immediately that you were lie
 to and will resent it.  END THE WAR ON THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES! 
<LI>Anything in excess will eventually turn out to be bad for you.  I personally think that alcohol is worse than marijuana because people don't think of it as a drug and therefore tend to go overboard.  However if used on a casual and infrequent basis in small amounts,  then one is no worse than the other.  What you do to your body is a personal choice and people need to learn to accept responsibility for the choices they make.  Peer pressure,  society,  poverty,  etc... are all just excuses that people u
e to avoid accepting responsibility for their own actions.
<LI>I believe that America could handle legalized drugs. I percieve that our greater danger lies in continuing our current policies and inprisoning millions of people / creating a police state / erroding our personal freedoms.
<LI>The war on drugs is the root cause of the high crime rate. 
<LI>The only reason why people are afraid of marajuana is because the public in general calls it DRUG,  we do not call people who drinks their daily coffee drugs adicts,  the cigarette smokers are not called drug adict, so why do people (the media, the "responsible adults") keep refering, when they talk about marajuana, to drugs!
<LI>Drugs should only be taken with a doctor's prescription to do so.
<LI>I think drugs have helped a lot more people in this world than they've hurt.
<LI>Alcohol is by far the biggest killer. Pot has been lied about by the goverment for years and is one of the least harmful of all drugs. If you gave kids pot instead of booze they would not be driving in to trees at 100mph and fighting over anything. 
<LI>Drugs are terrible!
<LI>if drugs were not restricted, they would cost no more then gum, so people would not steal for their habits.  people who wanted drugs could get them easily, and people who didnt dont have to take them.   however, there should be mandatory sentences for 'slipping' someone drugs to get them addicted.  but reasonable, 1 year or 6 months.  someone rotting in jail for 40 years being raped by gays and sponging government money solves NOTHING at all.
<LI>If you want to drink Drano, that is part of your right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of whatever.
<LI>There are too many differences between people who use drugs.  Some may find it beneficial and some find that it just makes things more complicated.  There is too much gray area to say whether or not it would be beneficial to legalize drugs.
<LI>Decriminalize durgs, BUT aim a new drug war at treatment, prevention, and taking all the "cool" out of heavy drug use.
<LI>People must be educated
<LI>I don't understand why marijuana is still illegal when alcohol has been proven to be more toxic.
<LI>the government needs to follow drugs to their source (usually S. America) and stop them there
<LI>LEGALIZE MARIJUANA!
<LI>should not be available to children in any form-unless medically necessary.  should hold people accountable for their actions concerning drugs.  some of the drugs listed above are legal number 5 and the legal ones i don't believe are as big a problem as the illegal ones. Time to get serious about our future!
<LI>personally i dont like them, except getting caned once in a while!! BUT i think its personal
<LI>laws against marijuana should stay in place but penalties should be weakened.  The prohibition of alcohol consumption by those 18-21 should be done away with completely!
<LI>I think it is stupid to use substances. But people have rights. One of the most important rights is the right to make a mistake. Another is the right to take responsibility for yourself, in fact we are obliged to. I refuse to be protected from myself. Let's make this a free country again! Harry Browne for President!
<LI>We need to get at the psycho/sociological CAUSES of drug use.  Without a market for drugs there would be no drug use.
<LI>I think all drugs (particularly addictive drugs) should be legalized.  The war on drugs is a joke and I'm tired of my tax dollar being used to further organized crime.  I don't condone drug use, but anyone who wants it can get it anyway.  
<LI>Drug legalization is vital if our nation is to remain free. We need to legalize all drugs with little or no harm to society (HEMP!!!!!) now and end the hate of the War On Drugs. Free the +1,000,000 pot POW's NOW!
<LI>Either legalize drugs, or crackdown on dealers, pushers, & users!
<LI>I fear the consequences of drug legalization but I have a principled objection to government paternalism. In general people should be free to do what they want unless it harms someone else.
<LI>Government should make no law restricting what you put into your own body. When government restricts what you can do with your body they are in effect saying the body you occupy belongs to the government and you are only allow "priveledges" of use.
<LI>all drugs are different, there is no 'one way' to deal effectively with an out of control drug problem, until you look at what in society people are having difficulty with, and why drugs are more acceptable to our generation than the preceding one. i'm 32 years old and i've seen friends and family willingly throw their lives away, for (1) Cocaine, very bad, extremely addictive, especially if injected(i know), and speed, it's everywhere, its cheap, and there's pure evil in every bag. i know that its onl
 a chemical,a powder, but if an inanimate substance can be evil, believe me, satan takes special intrest in that stuff, matter of fact, i've got a roommate who's about to start a detox program on monday, and it's been a monkey on my back for allmost 15 years, i hate the stuff, really, but next weak i'll forget whatever it was and be first in line to go that 3 or 4 days again!  very troubleing.
<LI>Prohibition has never worked and CAN'T work. 
<LI>Drug use should be like gays in the military -- don't ask/don't tell. If it doesn't effect your job or other people, what business is it of theirs?
<LI>drugs should be legal, if you want to do drugs thats your business and yours alone, if you get addicted and cant have a job, its your own fault, but if you can do drugs responsibly then they are a excellent stress reliever and entertainment. it is not the governments business to decide which chemicals/drugs are ok and which are not.
<LI>I'm opposed to drug usage in general, but prohibiting them only increases their usage and induces criminals to get involved in marketing them.
<LI>Education is very emportant. Being a good role model for kids.
<LI>Close the borders to drugs... they are a menace to society.
<LI>Drug use is not necessairly a bad thing - especially when we are still young. As long as the kids are educated about the drugs they're using, the physical and psychological effects (possible problems etc) AND they have a safe place to be (ie: NOT in a car
<LI>I wish it would stop. It is killing children and ruining families
<LI>There is a difference between drug use and drug abuse.  If any drug is to be legal then all should be legal ... the contrary is true as well.
<LI>We need to treat drug addicts, not jail them!
<LI>Legalization of low risk drugs (cannabis,psychedelics) would be a great thing
<LI>It's a personal decision which can readily affect the lives of others, so care should be taken by users and pushers alike not to overstep their bounds.
<LI>Marijuana should be legal as is alcohol.  People will continue to abuse drugs, but the others should remain by prescription or illegal because they're too dangerous.  If you want it you can get it.  Also, GET RID OF THE MANDATORY JAIL SENTENCING for drug offenses.  What a wasting of time, money and jail space!
<LI>We need to rethink our opinion of pot vs. alcohol. You don't hear of someone who gets stoned walking into a bar and whooping everyone there.
<LI>It should be up to the individual, and not a government whether on not someone uses/consumes some of the softer drugs such as Hash or E. The legalisation or de-criminalisation of certain drugs would criple organised crime and ensure drugs were of a guaranteed quality - lessening the risk to users. Education and legalisation is the key in my opinion.
<LI>Drugs start affecting/effecting you later in life and the penalty really hits alot harder then
<LI>I find it particularly ironic that the most vocal "anti-drug" crusaders think nothing of drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes -- substances that are responsible for thousands of deaths every year; far more than any other form of "drug abuse".  Who'
<LI>As far as kids using drugs and alcohol, parents should be more open and honest to their children and become educated themselves on the issue before passing on information to the kids.  They need to give all the pros and cons...talk about it objectively...give their kids the facts and then let them decide.  Kids don't like their decisions made for them.  It's when parents force their opinions or decisions on kids that the kids will immediately turn around and to the opposite...they'll do what their pare
ts don't want them to simply because they want to make the statement that they will make their own decisions.  The more taboo you make something, the more it will appeal to kids.
<LI>I see marajuana as a relaxant to be used in private or social atmospheres and see no reason it should not be legalized with an age limit.
<LI>I think a lot of drugs--both marijuana and alcohol should be legal but decommercialized--advertising distorts everything and would overpitch any drug.  
<LI>I do NOT consider tobacco a drug.  Alcohol is a drug and should be illegal
<LI>our crime problems in the US stem greatly from drugs being illeagal if they were legal crime would go down and govt. could make money fromtaxation of these drugs
<LI>Tax them heavily and let the junkies wipe out the deficit.
<LI>The problems associated with currently illegal drugs are a direct result of their prohibition, and not the drugs themselves. There is nothing inherently wrong, either morally or ethically, with "getting high". People who develop problems with drugs should be treated compassionately - such problems are medical, not criminal.  The government has no right, constitutional or otherwise, to prohibit responsible use of any drug.
<LI>The War on Drugs is a failure.  An attack against our own citizenry.
<LI>I am an alcoholic with 7 1/2 years of sobriety, and have not used illegal drugs in 18 years.  How I felt about using them had no relation to the reality of the damage they did to my personality and my life at that time.  They were devastating to me, and I tell my children that they are no good for civilized humans.
<LI>I choose to live my life essentially clean and sober,  but I do not judge those who choose differently.
<LI>now that I'm an adult I feel its use as a stimulant is senceless
<LI>Rejects of society. No will power.
<LI>I'll have been sober 10 years this coming October; alcohol and drugs nearly killed me. Those who want/need to use them will use them, whether they're legal or not. I won't judge anyone else for their own usage; for me, though, I'm simply amazed every day that I'm still alive.
<LI>Human beings will always search for an easy "high."  To attempt to prevent it because it is "bad" only leads to increased violence in an attempts to serve the demand.  Today's "War on Drugs" is a perfect parallel to Prohibition early in the century, down to thugs fighting over turf in the streets.  We're learning the same lesson a second time, let's redirect our energies to educating our children on the potential perils, and stop driving them to early deaths.
<LI>Almost the entire problem has resulted from making drugs illegal -- if they were legal, crime would plummet and we could help the small number of people who would still have an abuse problem.
<LI>All drugs should be legal and available, but education is the key to encouraging sobriety. Legislating morality is tyrany; Educating morality is liberty!
<LI>Should be a law against usage, but more important a continued process of educating our people about the causes and effects of all drug use.  The Clinton administration has not be solid in prevention as well as continued education in the use of drugs.
<LI>I think people use drugs and alcohol because they are seeking something like meaning in their lives.  All the laws in the world can't change that so they are useless to try.  We need to show people the answers not throw them in jail.
<LI>Its a personal freedom until it encroaches upon someone else.
<LI>I think the legalization of drugs would reduce the insentives to deal in and use them. Those who choose not to take responsibility for their use of drugs will become the victims of them. It's called natural selection.
<LI>The drug laws serve 2 purposes in this country. 1. It provides an opportunity for the creation of a authoritarian leviathan to enforce the laws. 2. It keeps the price very high allowing the government to finance covert activities by simply dumping the overpriced commodity on the streets.  
<LI>Drugs must be eliminated!!!  Dealers should get mandatory 25 years w/o parole
<LI>In Europe, where Marijuana is legal, there are not as many drug problems.  Same with alcohol.  Think about it.
<LI>Drug use is not a problem - it's a symptom.
<LI>The US govt. didn't declare war on drugs, it declared war on it's own citizens -- Making drugs illegal is a crime of the century.
<LI>Laws should definitely regulate availability but education is very important.  Ultimately the responsibility is the individual or the individual's parents (if a minor).
<LI>Drugs suck and dull the mind
<LI>They should be legalized.
<LI>Government seems happy to condone the use of revenue generating drugs such as tobacco despite the health costs involved but resists the legalisation of cannabis while maintaining the "reefer madness" atitude of the past.
<LI>To a certain extent, the individual should be able to make a free and informed choice of what they wish to do.  And by consuming the drug, be it more socially acceptible eg. drink, or less acceptible, eg. heroin, the person should not cause any problem to other people.  Also those not able to make a choice such as the younger members of society should have information available to know what they are about to take and the possible side-effects.
<LI>If you commit a crime or injure anyone under the influence of any substance you should be punished severly
<LI>Drugs and drug usage should be as little regulated as is medically reasonable. (This includes both physiological and psychological concerns.)
<LI>If it hadn't been for drugs my daughter wouldn't be dead these past 4 years.
<LI>abuse of any drug is a medical/spiritual problem;  not a criminal matter.
<LI>legalize it!!!
<LI>I feel that drugs pose a serious problem to our society, and our government needs to crack down on the individuals that deal AND sell them.
<LI>I think that natural drugs such as; Marijuana, mushrooms, peyote, ect..  should be decriminalized.  They grow for a reason, they are there for us to use.  It is very unfortunate that many people abuse them by not using them for a purpose other than getting "high".  
<LI>The "war on drugs" cannot possibly suceed.  It wastes far too much of our resources that could be put to better use against repeat violent offenders, child molesters, & other real criminals.
<LI>I tried alchohol and marijuana.  Didn't like either of them.  I didn't like the feeling of being on them.  I was on Prozac, and am now on Wellbutrin.  Antidepressants are the most wonderful invention ever!!!  People who have never suffered depression coul
<LI>Drug usage is the very biggest threat to our youth and , therefore to the future of this free, great country !
<LI>We need to keep them away from kids without preventing recreational use/abuse of adults who choose to use them.
<LI>Drugs should stay illegal; alcohol legal; Drugs dealers should be punished harder
<LI>All drugs should be legal. The federal govt has no authority in these matters -- not authorized by U.S. Constitution.
<LI>I would never trust a drug user. They have already demonstrated their poor decision making abilities as well as their weak will power. Drugs ARE illegal and ALL who use or deal should be held accountible and punished to the full extent of the law...no plea bargains!
<LI>The government should protect me from other people, not myself
<LI>Drug and alcohol use is a personal decision but education may help with this decision.  Addiction to drugs or alcohol can be devastating to a family.
<LI>It's hard to say what should be legal and what should not.  At some point the law would hopefully protect people from hurting themselves and others, but it must be balanced with personal choice.
<LI>As long as American society believes that drug abuse is a moral weakness
<LI>Drugs suck, but I don't know how to stop the usage. It's a huge problem all over the world, and something has to be done.
<LI>Some people that are more eveloved handle drugs(maryjane) better than most and infact, can benefit. Alcohol sux though. It's the opposite of enlightening and for that reason, it's still legal and dope isn't.
<LI>marijuana is no where near as damaging alcohol should be legalized
<LI>Need more forceful interdiction at source
<LI>no one should use them.;..
<LI>Drugs have been around since the beginning; therefore, it is impossible to totally eridicate them from society as long as money is used as the medium for commerece.  It is inevitable that some people, albeit a small number, will always abuse anything, God help us, even food.  Society has to learn to accpet that there will always be a small segement of people who will fail, no matter what the subject matter.   
<LI>distructive and substitute for real living
<LI>alcohol is more harmful to individuals and society than marijuana.
<LI>I think anyone can use drugs as much as they want if they do not infringe on my rights, don't drive drunk, don't break into my home to steal for your habit, don't collect SSI for being a drug abuser.  Destroy yourself, not others.
<LI>I believe that drugs in general should be legalized.  We should punish behavior that harms others (like drunk driving, or stealing to get money for drugs), but not the private, safe use of drugs by adults.
<LI>A personal matter which government has turned into a criminal and social problem
<LI>I don't understand why anyone would even want to start. What is the point???
<LI>I feel our country does not take the abuse of alcohol serious. It is the gateway drug, and our president should get as irate about the marketing to kids as he does tobacco.  
<LI>Used socially, responsibly (low end drugs) & moderately should not affect the average person. Of course there are those who cannot control their usage and drugs control them.  
<LI>Alcohol is probably the most abused and neglected drug that is available. Because of the social acceptance of its use there are seemingly fewer resources devoted to the abuse of this drug, which often causes the most societal problems
<LI>Drug use is a personal choice. Prohibition only increases the allure of drugs and creates a profitable black market where users can sell the means of their own destruction for profit as opposed to alcohol. Drug legalization would make the drug lifestyle as appealing as the alcoholic lifestyle and make drugs less available to children.
<LI>Everyone has a choice to create  his own life.My opinion is that it is better to  be free  of drugs  and happy without drugs.       .   .      
<LI>There should be more attention on treatment instead of interdiction
<LI>It's like adultery; it's a moral issue.  Though I may think it's wrong; I don't think it can be legislated.
<LI>Any drug that occurs naturally such as marijuana or mushrooms should be legal, anything that must be processed should not be legal
<LI>I believe in personal freedom and responsibility.  People should be free to do what they want as long as it doesn't hurt others
<LI>Drug usage is a problem as it locks a certain part of the population into crime and it does not solve their problems anyway.
<LI>its an issue up to each individual
<LI>Legalizing some drugs will make the "drug problem" look a lot better and will take the profit out of drug dealing.   Taxes on legal drugs should go to drug and alcohol rehab programs.
<LI>I believe the choice to put something into one's body should be there own decission.
<LI>You can't regulate or legislate the problem away.  You can't stop other counties from producing the drugs for import to your country.  A strong educational approach is all government can do to combat the problem.  Society must have strong family and community values to stop drug problems.  The US lacks that, so consequently, it has a major drug problem.
<LI>I think that all drugies are the scum of the Earth and should be hunted down and killed.
<LI>Drugs can be deadly, if abused.  Drugs impair your thinking and senses. People need to quit abusing themselves and others, with their drugs.
<LI>Drugs - under the right circumstances and conditions are very beneficial.  The very addictive (coke, crack, crank) drugs have no place in our society - It is destroying our inner cities and our youth.  Getting 
<LI>The war on drugs is not working. President Bill Clinton is asleep at the wheel. Sometimes I get the feeling he wants to legalize Drugs. Bad idea.
<LI>The Drug problem is a problem in education and enforcing proper use, draconic and simple solutions do not solve the problem.
<LI>More people die from tobacco use than all illegal drugs combined. Yet the same politicians who support the drug War on Some Drugs take tobacco money. This hypocrisy must stop. The drug war is a sham, and it's unconstitutional. Prisons should only be used for those who harm the person or property of another.
<LI>If you want to do them in the privacy of your own home. Fine.  But once you leave that sanctuary and interact and possibly infronge upon someone else's rights (such as DWI ro committing a crime, you should be punished to the full extent that the law allow
<LI>i think everyone should decide for themselves if they want to take drugs; people should learn more about drugs so they know how to deal with them; there is no known culture without drugs; drug prohibition is the source of many of society's and of individual drug problems (e g delinquency); drugs can be dangerous but also beneficial (same as for medicinal drugs); the dose makes the poison - Paracelsus
<LI>It's bad for your health & destroys your life.
<LI>drugs are bad for you when you begin to develop a patern of use
<LI>While I do not unrestricted drug/alcohol use, I do think they should be regulated (as far as quality and purity standards) and freely available.  Most of the problem with crime could be solved by legalizing drugs.  In any endeavor, the greater risk a person takes, the greater reward they expect.  A drug dealer is taking a big risk by dealing, therefore expects large financial rewards.  Most gangs are kids dealing drugs -- they can make more in part of one evening than they can in a month working at McD
nalds.  They are so expensive, that those who wish to purchase them can rarely afford them earning money through legitimate means, therefore resort to burglary, robbery, and dealing themselves.  There should be quality/purity standards, much like there currently is with alcohol.  If you drink three cans of Budweiser today, you know it will get you just as buzzed as the three you drank yesterday, or the three you drank last month.  You might not get as buzzed off of a whole bag of marijuana that you bought 
oday as you did off of one joint that you smoked last week.  Unfortunately, drugs will probably never be legalized, as there are too many people on BOTH sides of the law that make their livings on the present system.  Not just the dealers and smugglers, but how many judges, prosecutors, public defenders, police officers, and crime lab technicians would still be necessary if all crimes relating to the possession, sale, or purchase of drugs were suddenly removed from their workload?
<LI>Wellll we like to get extremly fucked up will we are on the net
<LI>It is going to continue no matter what is done to stop it
<LI>Drugs are a symptom of our societies weak moral attitude.
<LI>Drugs: It screws up your brain but then again if they had a brain in the first place they wouldn't be using it.
<LI>The question of whether to legalize drug usage is a tough one.  If it would take away the money and the crime then maybe we should legalize and regulate them.  Also make it as tough on driving drugged as driving drunk.
<LI>drugs should be legalized and taxed like tabacco and alchol.  Then the abusers would pay for their own medical bills.
<LI>I am concerned that very young people are involved, but because some of the drug awareness programs must prove they are needed to get gov't funding, it is impossible to know how wide spread this problem truely is.  This statement is based on a personal experience with a "drug & alcohol survey" used locally with school aged children.
<LI>Seeing as certain substances are illegal not because of the danger to individual users but to large faceless companies such as the paper industry, I think we need to rethink our government policies on the legalization of these substances.
<LI>I think drugs should be illegal unless need be. But I think proof being a passport should enough to buy smokes and alcohol.
<LI>It's sad that so many people seem to need/want drugs.  My life is very happy without anything but chocolate (and a drink once a month or so)!
<LI>its a personal issue.  Its up to the user.  
<LI>I believe that the "War on Drugs" is a total failure which has led to increased crime and unfair jail sentences for minimal users.  We should legalize drugs, control them as in The Netherlands, and  stop pandering to the fantasy that crimializing druge use will end it.
<LI>Certain drugs should be legalized (pot, MDMA);  they're less harmful and more effective than nicotine/alcohol in dealing with psychological and physical pain issues.  
<LI>I have never tried any sort of drug - nor will I.  But what right do I have to tell someone else what he can do to his own body - especially if his actions do not directly affect me at all?  Re-legalization is the only way to ensure personal liberty--vote for Harry Browne, Libertarian for President!
<LI>Marijuana should be legal and the drug war should focus more on hard drugs that cause peoples live to become ruined by addiction.
<LI>I do not believe my grandfather fought the war in Europe for freedom so that I will have to pee in a bottle.
<LI>All drugs should be legalized. I would not encourage anyone to use them, but legalizing them would make them worthless and would go along way to cutting down crime.
<LI>Like anything else, it's okay if you don't abuse it.
<LI>all people should be educated and free to make their own decisions about their own lives, esp. with respect to behavior as private, subjective, and personal as drug use.no one, especially any government, has the right to tell people what they can and cann
<LI>"TAKE THAT" FOREVER !!!!  AND NIRVANA TOO !!!
<LI>More educations could be offered by the governments
<LI>This is so deep and complex an issue to cover in a few words... Drug use has _always_ been a means of escape from compounded and unrelenting stresses of daily exsistance, but like almost anything else we do to combat the ills of our everyday lives, drug use can far too easily become the crutch that we beat ourselves with. I believe that - in the short view - because of the ultimately addictive and damaging nature of so many drugs, many drugs should continue to be outlawed and their _sources_ cut off. T
e question of punative action against individual abusers of drugs is difficult to answer, except that I believe punative action against all but the worst cases to be a waste of life, time, and money - like a social band-aid on a the gun-shot wound to the collective social conscience. In the broad view, I think we can only make a difference in people's lives by creating committed social change that supports the less expensive and more spiritually gratifying methods of rehabilitation, change of circumstance,
and active compassion. Thanks for listening...   (I said this wasn't easy. Ask me to translate James Joyce for you - that might have been easier !)   Tony Maeller,  dmael@lamar.colostate.edu
<LI>I believe marijuana should be legalized 
<LI>most teenagers trie drugs at one point.i think the drinking age should be lowered but not below the age of 18. but this would make it easier for other kids to buy beer.
<LI>More and better drug education is necessary. Cigarette ads should be more tightly regulated.
<LI>All drugs should be legally available. Any taxes on sales should be for education, drug treatment programs, and the national debt. Government, in general, should stay out of dealing and busting drug users.
<LI>We need to look at the psychological causes for drug use and address natural ways of dealing with them.
<LI>Drug use is a personal freedom issue. Activities which harm others may be regulated, activities which harm only oneself, may not.
<LI>Drug dealing should be penalized more severely
<LI>Drugs are not necessary to lead a productive life.
<LI>The only problem I have with drug use is that it is easily available to those unable(incompitent) to use them wisely or to make a desision without refering to peer presure.
<LI>unequivocal legalistion of cannabis.
<LI>More education on drug and alcohol abuse/addiction is needed.  Along with a zero-tolerance for EVERYONE!
<LI>Legalize it!
<LI>I've been using marijuana for a few years now, and can't understand why such a harmless drug should be prohibbited, while alcohol and tobbaco are killing millions and aren't. 
<LI>Drugs and use of is completely wide spread among youth. I come from a priveleged background and along with my friends have been so called well educated about drugs etc yet we all use drugs to some extent. I think what is being left out of drug education is the effects...good and bad. I think that open discussion about drugs with people siting personal experiences would encourage more informed decisions about usage as people realise that drugs affect different people in different ways. Educating kids ab
ut drugs before they get exposed to them presents an unreal view. Which becomes the authoritaritive view that kids love to make fun of. 
<LI>Any drug that physically harms another (eg: smoking) should be banned.
<LI>There should be no government restrictions on a natural product. There should no differnce between corn and marijuana. They a both worthy cash crops.
<LI>I think the entire drug issue for most drugs is a matter of not health or our Gov being worried about its people. No I think the whole issue is basically WHICH industry (ie Tabbacco, Alchohol) owns more of congress than the others. 
<LI>Marijuana and any other drug that grows freely should be legalized. Marijuana causes no harm to the body. Maybe a little but less than a whole lot of legal substances. It's not addictave wither. I'm not addicted to marijuana but I'm addicated to Pepsi. I'm tryiong to stop drinking it because I never drink water. Legalize it!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I think that certain drugs such as mary jane should be legalized and put in their own little cigerette packs with 20 class A BLUNTS!!!! but I also think that certain drugs such as LSD, PCP, ESTACY,CLOUD 9 , DOWNERS AND UPPERS SHOULD STAY THE SAME.
<LI>I want to agree with the libertarian view that everyone should be free to use whatever drugs he or she wishes, with only the effects on others (e.g., accident while DUI, robbery/theft to support habit, cost of health care for bodily damage from drugs) being punished by law.  However, I am *lucky* (not morally superior) to have had a background, body chemistry, social environment, and intellectual outlook on life that together will probably always keep me from using drugs harmfully.  Many others do not 
ave such a fortunate combination.  The world needs more resources dedicated to reducing demand for harmful use (e.g., education and rehabilitation), rather than so much to legal punishment.
<LI>made legal but regulated
<LI>I think that doing something that is harmful to ones body is syupid, but it is a matter of choice.
<LI>Drug abuse is a social issue that should be dealt with by building strong communities, not by demonizing users.
<LI>Only if the users know what they are using
<LI>if used irresponsibly, any drug can be dangerous or problematic. be careful folks! 
<LI>My most pressing issue with drug usage is concern for those who use them, esp. children.
<LI>DrUG's KiCK AsS
<LI>I LOVE DRUGS! MARJUANA IS SO GOOD
<LI>I think this is a personal & social issue.  People should be free to indulge in their drug of choice UNLESS it hurts ANY ONE else.  The current system is a total hypocrisy.  Alcohol is way more damaging to our society than marijuana, yet it's legal.  Could it be that one can purchase Tequila or cigarettes over the counter, paying TAXES on it, when Tequila and cigarettes are far more dangerous than natural substances like marijuana.  A stoner is way less likely to have a vehicle accident than a drunk.  
 don't think the government can make money off marijuana, thus it's illegal. 
<LI>Marijuana research should be objectively conducted. Growing for personal use should be legalized. Medicinal and social uses should be legalized and controlled.  Additionally, tobacco should be more tightly controlled to reduce availability to minors.  Use
<LI>I don't advocate abuse of any drug, including alcohol & tobacco, and know that drugs can really screw up one's life & body.  However, prohibition and draconian enforcement of drug laws is not working - it just fills our prisons with drug offenders and encourages disrespect of the law, just as Prohibition of alcohol in the 20's did.  Drugs should be legalized and the money from the War on Some Drugs should go towards rehabilitating addicts and teaching the public to use in moderation, not abuse drugs.
<LI>cigarettes are very additive  and are legal pot nonadditive illegal does't make much sence
<LI>Education is important, but legalization is the only way to solve most of the problems, from organized crime, to addiction.  You spelled Prozac wrong, and crank and methamphetamine are the same thing.  Most of those listed above, if not all, can be used for medicinal purposes in a controlled environment.
<LI>xxxxxxxxxxxx
<LI>More Moeny should be spend on Education and less on in enforcement
<LI>Except for medicinal uses, there is no legitimate reason for using drugs.
<LI>Drug use amongst young people needs to be stopped.
<LI>It's bringing down this country, ruining some of my friends, destroying the core of this nation, the family.  Drugs are a good thing in the hands of those whom have knowledge to distribute them under medical authority.  
<LI>It's none of the government's business.
<LI>Ban them all in public (especially cigarette smoking).. let people drink/smoke cigarettes/smoke marijuana in their own house if they way.
<LI>Such a problem I cannot answer #16.  I don't know how to deal with it all. Some people probably drink or smoke instead of thinking about this. This issue is so close, I cannot believe ther is anyone who is not either addicted, has lost a loved one to addiction/death, or will in the next 5 years.
<LI>Hard core illeagal narcotics and other dangerous drugs are damaging the fabric of our society.  A very aggressive program should be undertaken to stop the flow of Narcotics into this country.  Further pentalies for dealing and manufacturing durgs must be stiffened
<LI>What you do should be your own business; however, if it affects others, you should reconsider your actions.  The only problem is, even if you think you are only affecting yourself, you really don't know how you're affecting others.  Education is the key....
<LI>certain drugs are good some are bad
<LI>Human beings can make better use of their mental faculties if they avoid them. However banning any currently legal would not work and some drugs on a par with alcohol should be legalised though getting 'stoned' or drunk should be discouraged.
<LI>It is stupid to try to regulate drug and alcohol.  People have their freedom to choose what they want to do with their life.  If they want to kill themselves, that's their choice.  The only thing we can do is to educate people better.  By telling people w
<LI>Drugs should be legalized and their abuse treated as a medical problem.
<LI>Education is the key. Unfortunately there will always be people who are prepared to abuse the system for personnal gain (money, kudos etc). The protection of minors is important. Those at risk due to factors other than age, education, peer pressure, etc should not be discounted under the banner of free will/ old enough to decide. However this is not an excuse for the current lack of tolerance. My opion of which drugs should be legaised is based on my own experience and I cannot comment on those that I 
ave no experience of. 
<LI>certain drugs have a positive psychological and physical effect (this is backed up by strong medical evidence- ie: in the case of MS sufferers) and therefore there is a case for legalisation - however, others (generally the manufactured ones) are addictive and physically and psychologically bad for you, so in those cases i think that  they should not be freely available and the penalties for using/supplying them should be increased
<LI>This problem will in the end destory any person or counrty.
<LI>Legalise everything but control it through government/quango bodies. Consideration should be made concerning users in the work place as well as health benefit scemes etc. It hardly seems fair to offer free medical care to people sufering from the side effects of their own lifestyle decitions. The same could apply to those who participate in any dangerous recreational activities.
<LI>Drugs allow what was not previously possible (eg staying awake for 5 days straight, etc).
<LI>everything is a drug - an escape, whether it's cocaine or wheel of fortune... get used to it - people with addictive personalities can abuse anything - treat the source, not the symptom.
<LI>cool
<LI>I feel that certain drugs, if administered and montitored by qualified persons, can be beneficial for some individuals.
<LI>i don't mind legalization of many. but the penalties for "public effects" of the drug use should be REALLY harsh. use'em, but keep'em in your yard.
<LI>natural drug eg. MJ/hash/oil/mushrooms/opium/peyote/mescaline should be legalized all other should have tighter controls put on them
<LI>I don't know.
<LI>By making usage of drugs such as alcohol and cigarettes taboo for children, parents and society only fetishize these substances and make them more attractive to children, who are in turn more likely to overindulge when they finally have access.
<LI>Spock and Data in '96 - The Logical Choice!
<LI>Drugs which are currently illegal should stay so.
<LI>I don't like to drink anymore, but I like marijuana. Actually, I don't use it that much, but wish I could more often.  As for caffiene, its so much a part of society, that its almost impossible to avoid. As for all other drugs, I prefer to stay away from them.
<LI>I must thought first before consuming
<LI>LEGALIZE BUT SEVER PUNISHMENT FOR ALL CRIMES COMMITED WHILE ON ALCOHOL OR DRUGS.
<LI>Moderation is key.  But to achieve that that level of consumption is difficult.  
<LI>I am in favor of legalization of some milder drugs, ie pot, education of the young is a must, just as with alcohol, adults should be able to grow/purchase for own use
<LI>don't do it man-just say no
<LI>It is a personal choice and none of the government's business
<LI>As long as people take drugs with responsability they should be allowed to. Hard drugs as heroine destroy the personality, they ought to be illegal. It is better to persecute dealers than junkies. 
<LI>some people know  when to say when..fine for them..I dont.
<LI>Leave tobacco companies alone! 
<LI>doing drugs often allowed me to be destuctively passive in all things/a who cares type of attitude.in Christ I am now a new person no longer under the BONDAGE of DRUGS.
<LI>I don't do them anymore, and never will again.  However, I feel that everybody should have that choice, knowing full well what the consequences for each are.
<LI>Using drugs, drinking alcohol, or smoking are a personal decision that doesn't require the interference of the gov., except under cercumstances where it interferes with others (drinking and driving).  The "Drug War" created more crime/violence than it stopped.  Kids should learn about "personal responsiblity" from family, friends, community.
<LI>I firmly believe that the preamble to the U.S. constitution said it best: All human beings have certain rights which are deemed unalienable; among these are: truth, justice, and the pursuit of happiness!
<LI>Using drugs, drinking alcohol, or smoking are a personal decision that doesn't require the interference of the gov., except under cercumstances where it interferes with others (drinking and driving).  The "Drug War" created more crime/violence than it stopped.  Kids should learn about "personal responsiblity" from family, friends, community.
<LI>Using drugs is OK, if that doesn't harm other people.  There's nothing bad in smoking a joint alone or with some friends, to have fun.  Some drugs like pot should be legalized.  Alcohol should be illegal.
<LI>I think it is up to the individual to know enough about themselves to make an informed choice of whether or not to use.
<LI>Drugs and alcohol lead to moral decay. They harbor no value!
<LI>End drug prohibition. It encourages black market trade, pushers to target kids, gangs to fight over turf, and creates more prisons and police than we can afford.
<LI>People who are addicted to Illegal drugs, should(though not likely) should have it made easy to go to a rehab.  If it is perscribed by an Doctor for medicidinal reasons then it is okay.
<LI>Drug use by our youth is the root of most of our problems.  We need tougher laws to deal with users as well as dealers.  Our revolving door justice system is very bad.  We need to change that and get tough on druggies.
<LI>Although I've seen the negative effects of the excessive consumption of both drugs and alcohol, I still firmly believe in personal freedoms. If someone CHOOSES (and at first, using IS a choice) to use, then who am I to stop them? When they hurt someone else..then it becomes a different story. DUI's should be punished severely as should any crime committed while under the influence.
<LI>i think drugs should be legalized because they have been aroun for centuries and people will do them anyway.Also,if they were legal the money generated from them would go to the government and not some rich drug dealer.
<LI>Education, education, education.  The majority of the problems concerning alcohol and drugs is associated with mis-use because of misinformation due to the lack of adequate and correct education.
<LI>The Laws do not need amending. 
<LI>I think that social drinking is okay as long as the person involved can handle it and knows when to stop.  As the parent of a teenager, I feel that too much emphasis is put on saying no, as opposed to learning responsibility.  I also think that drugs, unless over the counter or by prescription (with monitoring), should be illegal.  
<LI>If a person does not have positive control of their life, then drugs and alcohol can be detrimental to them.. 
<LI>moderation, moderation, moderation
<LI>marijuana should be legalized
<LI>The only thjing that makes a drug a drug is the question if it`s legal or illegal. I`m a BIG promotor of marijuana myself caus i don`t c any objections against free distribution of a substance that`s less harmful than legal drugs as alcohol, sugar, coffee etc.  !
<LI>Hash, grass or whatever you wish to call it, has, NEVER killed anyone because of it's use.  Why is illigal?  Because it is illigal users have access via the dealer to other drugs.  Making grass legal would remove the black market side of the use and, in time, remove many other drugs, or at least make them harder to get hold of.  I have many other thoughts on this area but I suspect nothing you haven't heard already.
<LI>if it's 
<LI>No Answer
<LI>drugs and alcohaul can be both beneficial and dangerous depending on the individual and the circumstances.  A government carrying out a war on its own people can benefit no one and harm many.  Each of us owns our own body, what we take into it is our own decision, and not the governments'.  People however must accept full responsibility for their actions whether under the influence of any drug or not..
<LI>Marijuana and Hashish are socially and physicaly less harmful than alcohol and should be legal.
<LI>I know from experience with my son, that drug use causes changes in personality, and limits a persons ability to use good judgement.  I believe it is a spiritual void people are trying to fill with drugs, and until our country gets back to it's moral roots, we are going to have people escaping in drugs.
<LI>Drugs are extremely harmful to our country.
<LI>Distrubition of drugs should not be enforced.  It is your right to ruin your life.  We cannot allow for dictatorship, as this causes childlike attitudes.  ie.. hand in the cookie jar. 
<LI>I THINK ITS DUMB ITS KILLING WAY TOO MANY OF OUR PEOPLE IT IS TEARING US APPART NOW ITS TIME TO COME TOGETHER AND WORK THIS OUT AS A WHOLE COUNTRY NOT JUST A FEW PEOPLE FROM GOVERMENT BUT EVERYONE AS A WHOLE!!
<LI>Unless we make kids aware of the dangers of drugs, even legal ones, we will never solve the problem of addictive behavior.
<LI>We live in a free country right?It should be an individual's right, to do it or not to do it.
<LI>MJ should be decriminalized.
<LI>A terrible thing that unless curbed will destroy the nation.
<LI>doing drugs in your house doesn't hurt anyone but yourself.\
<LI>As an educator I see children addicted to drugs and alcohol at earlier ages.  Third graders are alcoholics b/c they see their parents doing it or their lives are so horrible they need alcohol or drugs to escape it.  Also, contrary to popular belief, in the high schools, it is the smart or 'gifted' students who abuse alcohol and/or drugs more frequently possibly due to incredible amounts of pressure from schools, parents, and themselves.  They say the drugs help them relax aven though they know the draw
acks (ex. most could outline the process of cirosis of the liver in medical terms!).  The abusers are becoming younger and younger.
<LI>Drugs and their usage are definetly best being illegal. They should NOT be legalized, and anyone who does drugs needs to seriously think about their lifestyle!!
<LI>Drugs are not the problem, people's relationship to them is the problem.  Adults should be warned of the effects of drugs, but not prohibited from using them.
<LI>Drug use should be the responsibility of the user.  By regulating drugs, the government cannot deal with abuse in the appropriate manner.  
<LI>It's a matter of personal, adult responsibility.  Some people can experiment with anything and be ok; others can't handle legal drugs (alcohol).  The "War on Drugs" is a no-brainer solution to a complex sociological problem, and should be replaced with decrminalization and treatment programs.  ps- it's nitroUs oxide - check spelling.
<LI>Recognition of individual differences is key, as long as people make educated and informed choices about substance usage.
<LI>I think the drug laws are barbaric and stupid.  To quote Timothy Leary, "I am 100% for the intelligent, moderate use of drugs and 1000% against careless, excessive use."
<LI>Drug PROHIBITION  is the ROOT cause of almost all crime.  It results in gangs, convinience store robberies, strung out prostitutes, police corruption, cartells(government created monopolies), Legalize ALL popular drugs AND Drug  treatments(methodone, etc)and crime WILL plumet.
<LI>I believe drugs (especially alcohol) suck.  To me it is unbelievable how many youths are addicted, or just plain use these harmful substances; it is something that should be stopped but will most likely not unless we take drastic measures.
<LI>I don't do anything but have an occasional drink, but I do think that drugs should be legalized and controlled by the government.  I don't agree with public use of hard drugs, private use should be legal.  Use on the job should be strictly enforced.  Ther
<LI>should be a personal choice , but as with all matters the result of the choice is your problem
<LI>Some people can function while on drugs/alcohol while many others cannot.  I think we need more public programs to help those with serious drug/alcohol problems.  I come from a family with a history of alcohol problems, it can ruin your life, your family and your job. 
<LI>Drugs are great as long as they are used with care and moderation.  You ned to realize the effects, both negative and positive, before you take a drug.  Drugs aren't for morons.
<LI>Bad karma
<LI>I believe all drugs should be freely available.I believe their use for other than medicinal purpose is misguided.
<LI>Don't "just say no", Say "NO TOLERANCE!!!"
<LI>Go for it! If you are happy why not be happier. If you are unhappy why not se drugs to get the space you need to change. Drugs won't solve the problem, but *not* taking drugs won't solve it either.
<LI>Responsible adults should be allowed to make their own decisions on drug use when it comes to relatively benign drugs such as psychdelics.  More effort should be directed towards preventing children from smoking tobacco, it is the worst killer of all.  I am a good example of someone that has used many drugs responsibly, without it affecting my overall role as a citizen or person.
<LI>End drug prohibition.
<LI>Legalize it - vote Harry Browne in '96
<LI>Recovering alcoholic and drug addict.  Everyone is different - some people can use drugs/alcohol safely - just not me.  They should be legal.  It is the lifestyle which often creates more problems then the actual drug ie heroin addicts/prostitution to support habit, etc... have a nice day...:)
<LI>illegal drugs are dangerous and need to remain illegal
<LI>drugs are more of a way out of problems. There should be certain allowances for drug usage
<LI>Victimless/concensual acts should not be crimes.
<LI>i believe it's okay in moderation and does not effect the person taking them or others around them in a negative way.
<LI>Certain drugs should be legal, pot for one.  
<LI>The evidence that governmental regulations are ineffective is overwhelming. I firmly belive that all drugs (even your morning coffee) are harmful and dangerous when abused or used by the wrong person. Yet making substances with legitimate medicinal and in
<LI>Drugs should be legal, and it should be up to everyone if they wanna take them or not. 
<LI>people should be discouraged of taking drugs but not punished
<LI>In many cases, people are self-medicating. I did (with methamphetamines) for several years. Now, I take Prozac for depression, and have no desire at all for drugs. I drink to help me sleep, but even that may be a thing of the past, now that I've been prescribed Trazodone.
<LI>So long as they harm only themselves people should be allowed to do as they please
<LI>Drug users are REALLY unintelligent.  I mean, get REAL, what kind of IDIOT would do that? Its suicide.. And that's the absolute WORST thing you could possible do to yourself.
<LI>This is a personal issue and education can help. You should know what you are doing and feel able to handle the effects of what you are about to do, and know if it is to much
<LI>Drugs should be legalized for adults, with known risks, interactions, etc. on the labels.
<LI>Caffine and Alchol are socialy acceptable drugs.. why not Hash and Mary Jane?
<LI>I've taken them, enjoyed them, but I don't do them any more, except for the occasional joint. I stopped because I didn't feel like taking them anymore, not because I was addicted, arrested, or even asked to stop.
<LI>I think that you should be able to do what you want with your body
<LI>I'd like to qualify my answer to 16 by suggesting a similar regulation for all drugs as we do for alcohol at the moment
<LI>That the drinking age should be lowered to 18 and marijuana should be legal.
<LI>Strict regulation historically accomplishes nothing other than increasing violent crime, and decreasing individuals' desire to take responsibility for their own behaviour.
<LI>We want free, legal, backyard marijuana! Let it Grow!
<LI>some drugs which are legal(like alcohol) are not as good for me as a person as ecstasy and lsd are...legal drugs are just as "bad" as illegal ones, so there should be all drugs legal or nothing...also the drugs would be more pure i.e not as bad for the bo
<LI>everyone gets stoned, will we put the whole population in jail for it?
<LI>need better social controls; legal ones do not work very well
<LI> in my younger days I thought that it was cool. I now find that due to marijuana useage I dont recall things as easily as I once did. It has altered somethinginmy brain which I cannot change. I will and continue to direct youngsters away from it and all drugs.
<LI>Just as with everything else in the world, there will always be some people who will ruin their lives or do stupid things using drugs... But I only feel positive effects from my own drug usage. It's a fascinating hobby, of sorts, with mystical undercurren
<LI>Substance abuse should be dealt with as a disease rather than a crime. A small fraction of the massive funds we dedicate to the criminal control of drugs could be dedicated to the education and care of abuse as a social and health problem, saving millions
<LI>Drugs in the medical field arte seen as tools to help fix problems, or alleviate symtoms.  This is the reason for any substance, to help, but if abused it will cause problems. education on drug use is very important, but drug use is also very imporntmnt in learning.
<LI>The individual has a perfect right to poison him/her/itself - provided that he/she/it accepts the consequences (no medial care for drug abusers)
<LI>Marijuana should be leagalized for medical use ONLY. Such as in treating the side-effects of AIDS and cancer treatments.
<LI>All drugs should be handled under a medical rather than a criminal model and should be available by consumer choice.
<LI>legalize them.  it would cut down on crime, much of which is now drug related, and it would save lives - also, if drugs are legal, they can be regulated as alcohol and tobacco are.
<LI>marijuana is boring. decriminalisation and education would be more effective/appropriate.
<LI>All drugs should be legal. The government should spend drug prevention money on education. Drug use/misuse cannot be stopped by force. The government should educate, then license drug users, then sell users the drugs they want. Undersell the dealers and put them out of business. This WILL lower crime. Too bad we live in such a hypocritical, Victorian era of selfcentered political BS.
<LI>A self destructive attitude is the major factor in drug and alcohol abuse and all the regulations in the world can't stop that. Prevention by education is the best method of counteracting the problem. Regulation can be effective also, but with things as they are it would never be as effective as education and good family support for our children.
<LI>I am in favor of legalizing marijuana since its effects are no worse than alcohol
<LI>most of the problems i've seen have been causes by the prohibition of drugs not the drugs.  banning substances hampers the ability to test, and improve drugs and nullifies any quality control efforts.  
<LI>In 1910 a ten year old could buy herion off the counter without a perscription or even a note from his parents and there was no drug problem then.  The "War on Drugs" has created war zones in our cities.  Legalizing all drugs will take away the profit for the criminal element. 
<LI>If drugs were made legal and accesible through medical supervision it would take the profit out of the business and greatly reduce crime.  Drug usage is an individual psychological problem and individuals should seek porofessional help in making decisions about it.
<LI>As long as there is a demand for drugs and high profits for their sales, drugs will continue to be an unsolvable problem. Prosecution of those involved in the drug trade addresses niether of these facts.
<LI>I think using drugs is an extremely pathetic way to lead your life.  Life is so short, you never know when you're going to die, so why waste any second of it on drugs?
<LI>Maraijuana should be re-legalized, and treated in much the same way as alcohol.  Other drugs should be decriminalzed.  We need to stop treating addicts like criminals, although I do feel that dealers should face severe consequences.
<LI>We spending to much money trying to stop drug.  We should look for other ways that are more cost effective.
<LI>I have seen what drugs can do to you if used improperly.  Any drug that is not necessary to your well being should not be available.  All drugs with a degree of harmfullness should be sold by prescription only and any drug (ie. marijuana, crack etc) should not be readily available, period.
<LI>too much money is being spent in the losing war on drugs...fund education instead.
<LI>Government has no business legislating morality. The model used in Holland is the only one that has evr worked. The "War on Drugs" can never be won and is profoundly stupid and wastefull. 
<LI>Like every thing in life:  Abuse and you lose it.  Know your limitations and certain drugs (and alchohol) can be personally enjoyed.  One should not use drugs or alchohol if it causes physical or mental harm to other individuals. 
<LI>I believe certain natural drugs such as marijuana and mushrooms should be legalized.  Marijuana is a widely used drug with effects a lot like tobacco.  If certain drugs were legalized the government could regulate them.  With this intervention, it would produce a large amount of revenue.  This revenue could be used to educate children and rehabilitate addicts.  In the Netherlands, where marijuana is legal and regulated, they have one of the lowest drug problems in the world.  It can be done and it can 
e successful.  It is time our government realizes what the people are doing by choice.  Whether it is illegal or not, marijuana is a part of popular culture.  Like prohibition of alcohol, anything that criminalizes a significant portion of the populace will be ignored - giving rise to a profitable black market. The greatest lesson of history is not to repeat it's mistakes.  
<LI>Anything that I can find and use that is growing in the wild should not be controlled by anyone in anyway!
<LI>Any drug should be freely available. Its ones own personal responsibility for ones own actions.
<LI>The "heavy" drugs are causing serious crime problems in our country.  Law enforcement needs to be just, swift, and sure.  There are too many roadblocks and not enough prisons.    
<LI>I think more education and less regulation is the answer to drug and alcohol problems
<LI>There definately needs to be education in the school systems. However, if someone is old and mature enough, and wants to try marijuana then it should not be a crime. I feel that marijuana should be legalized. There are just too many benefits. 
<LI>There is a time for everything inlcuding drugs.
<LI>Drugs  are  stupid, bad  for  you,  and  they  should  burn  in  hell!!!
<LI>Drugs are very dangerous and penalities should be much stiffer on not only delers and users but up to and including death penalty  for those involved  in the upper  levels
<LI>Society tends to recycle old ideas.
<LI>Stop the insane war on drugs.
<LI>Drugs are a trap. They mask the problems you are having by making you forget them for a few hour.  Before you get high you are 1 month behind in your rent and there is no food in the refrigerator.  You get high to forget and when you come down your 2 months behind in rent and someone stold the refrigerator.  You may not think so at the time but It not only compounds your problems but it causes health problems later on that the USA will have to pay for and we cant afford it.
<LI>I think most of these drugs can be dangerous to use. I think drug use should be treated as a HEALTH problem, though, not a legal/moral one.
<LI>Legalazation of drugs in response to the current crisis facing America is dangerous and foolish.
<LI>I think things are getting worse, for example, kids are getting into drugs at a younger age then before and this will continue to happen so sooner or later kids will be starting at age 7 or earlier which is horrible!
<LI>Prohibition doesn't work. We must put up with occassional drug problems
<LI>The use of any/all substances, is a personal/moral issue, that government has no legitimate right to legislate. What government should legislate however is a persons behavior I.E. violent, careless, stupid as aresult of using drugs and or alcohol.
<LI>I beleive that alchol and drugs are hereditary and drug dealers as well as drug users should be penalized.  More schools should teach the effects of alchol and drugs.  I've been clean for 8 and 1/2 years.  Drug treatment centers should be acessable to all that need the help, it isn't easy some people need to go through treatment more than one time, like me I went twice before I grasped the program.
<LI>Drug use is a sad attempt to escape from reality.  People I have known who used drugs admit that it is an escapist tool.  Why not make human freinds to talk to instead of using drugs as an escape from your problems?
<LI>I feel that people are totally stupid and should be ashamed for using them.  Do they have any idea as to what they are doing to themselves!?!?  I feel that this needs to become a bigger issue than it is.  People are caring enough to stop the drugs or the usage!
<LI>You can not legislate morality. What a person does to his or hers body,as long as it doesen't harm or interfear with anyone else, it thats persons private business. Not the government,not the churchs, not any other group with an axe to grind.
<LI>Drug usage should only be used for proper medicinal purposes if any.   People should be able to find their own high without the help of such addictive substances. 
<LI>I hate seeing people's lives distroyed by drugs.
<LI>I believe that all drugs that are illegal should remain illegal. They have no benefit unless medicinal purposes are found for them.
<LI>Making drugs illegal is a joke as they are unenforcable. It is a HUGE waste of our tax money. People who want drugs get them.....even in jail.  It's another instance of this country's Rebublican Jesunatzi's trying to run everyones life.  
<LI>Drugs should be legal; their use is a personal decision with no victim involved.  It is not the Government's or an employer's business as to what a person does on their on time.  Only when a person infringes on the rights of others should they be searched, arrested or jailed.
<LI>I agree that this country has a serious drug problem, but I believe it is a drug enforcement problem. The police in this country need to be curtailed severely or we all risk losing a most basic freedoms.
<LI>i wonder how it feels when i take drugs..
<LI>Drugs are a poison that corrupts the spirit. People will use drugs as a crutch, and thus will not learn how to deal with their problems.
<LI>Except for the very habit forming they should be legal
<LI>Legailty has, for political reasons, little to do with safety in either direction; what is banned cannot be supervised, and it is unsupervised use which most often leads to casualties.
<LI>i couldn't live without them. they're better than sex. that's pretty damn great. i get my pussy wet just thinking about getting fucked up.
<LI>They should legalize tobacco and marijana.. would cut down on arrests and kids being kicked from school.  There should be a rule.. high when you are in school, or smoke, you are gone for good.
<LI>we shoul leagalize drugs it would put the dealers out of buisness .and help ballence our bugdet..if people are going to use ,nothing will stop them.
<LI>Many people who abuse drugs & alcohol have other psychological projects which they are masking with the substance. Our society needs to deal with mental health issues more; we're putting our money and efforts in the wrong place.
<LI>X rules....    Can't get addicted...  feels great... should be legal... nuf said!
<LI>Drugs are an escape, but then again, so is television; drug are a method of enlightenment, but then again, so is television (potentially)
<LI>There are  people that will never use harmful drugs, and people will will no matter what, the people in the middle should be educated enough to know enough about them to decide for themselves.  But if they do decide "yes" and get caught they should be punsihed.
<LI> I think if drugs were legal the producers would stand to make a profit. It is hyppocritical of the US to try and legislate or penalize other countries in Cental or South America when drug and alcohol related deaths are the #1 cause of death in this count
<LI>drug users are stupid,silly, dumb because life is short and they take that fucking bullshit to have fun but it kills themselves. All of drug users are motherfucker!!!
<LI>No productive member of society would be involved with illegal drug use.  It undermines our value system and puts all at risk whether personally - health - or societally.
<LI>I do not see the need for drugs in my life, even those prescribed for me.  I only take drugs if I am in pain for more than 24 hours, and then it is usually nothing more than an aspirin.  As for others using drugs, as long as they are safe, and are not likley to do others harm, let them.
<LI>Most substances that are illegal should remain so because of their socially detrimental effects. If someone decides to use drugs or alcohol they should be prepared to face the consquences of their actions.
<LI>The drug problem is closely related to many other crimes in this country.  We need to emphasize to our children, young and old, they do not need drugs to enjoy life or to solve their problems.  Drug usage is a major cause in our decline in social values. 70% of the illegal drugs produced worldwide are consumed by people in this country.  Where does the problem really lie?
<LI>I think the buying, selling, and use of all drugs should not be prohibitied, regulated, nor taxed in any way.  I am not personally interested in the use of drugs right now.  I think it is OK for purposes of spirituality, creativity, productivity, and recreation in moderation.  I would try to convince people not to use unsafe or addictive drugs, and I would like to see drugs made safer and less addictive.
<LI>Peolple should be able to enjoy life without the aide of substances.
<LI>Certain recreational drugs should be allowed. I believe that all forms of alcohol and tobacco should be regulated, controlled and sold by government agencies to restrict access to those persons of legal age. This could perhaps prevent young people from becoming addicted at such early ages.
<LI>Just like everything else, when used with intelligence, and in moderation, drugs & alchohol can be very pleasing.  
<LI>I think that every one who wants to will at least experiment with drugs and/or alcohol. If it only goes that far then ok. Once it goes past that them you have a problem and need help. I used to not care about drugs, sure go ahead knock yourself out...until my sons were born. I've thought about the nite that I would be called in to ID his body because he overdosed by one of his friends. Just the thought of kids and drugs makes me sick!
<LI>Humanity will always take drugs and we should humanize the rules.
<LI>I think that drugs are a reason the world is turning into such a hateful place.
<LI>We could stop a lot of crime and the government would make a lot of money by legalizing certain drugs.
<LI>I don't know...
<LI>As far as whether to legalize currently illegal drugs, I think we have enough problems without adding another legal vice for kids to adopt.  Education on drugs/alcohol avoidance must start at home...a strong home is the key!!
<LI>I think they should legalize marijuana....it's better for you than alcohol
<LI>Some folks that I hold in high esteem seem to think drugs are an appropriate means to an end.   I'm not sure I can understand that position.
<LI>Prohibiting the use of drugs only makes them more attractive to some - education is the only answer
<LI>drugs are always going to be used whether they are legal or not so why doesn't the government just tax them and make some money out of it
<LI>Light, social drugs are not as harmful as research makes them out to be.
<LI>Trust in liberty requires that people be alowed to make both good and bad choices for themselves.  "Trust in libery is an acknowledgement of faith in God and his works", Freidric Bastiat, The Law, 1850.
<LI>One of the largest problems this country faces.
<LI>I love drugs 
<LI>With Prozac, none of the stronger drugs are necessary
<LI>   It is a persons personal choice. I don't like it when peoples or my own drug use affects myself or others. Drugs should not come inbetween friends.
<LI>I think drugs are incredibly stupid, a waste of time, money and life. I have seen too many people destroyed by drugs. I have rarely used any, and will not beyond Tylenol and such and prescription if I need it. If there MUST be drugs, I'd rather see people use marijuana than any other, including alcohol and nicotine. I would never personally use marijuana even if it were legal. I have strong feelings about this, as most of my family will likely die of some sort of drug abuse, be it cigarrettes, alcohol 
r stronger drugs.
<LI>If my body truly belongs to me, what I put into it is no one's business but mine.  The government believes that IT owns my body.  The choice is mine to make, and I have made the right one by avoiding mind altering drugs.
<LI>I think that drugs (cocaine, heroin, marijuana...) are generally more detrimental to a person's health than is alcohol.
<LI>I fell that people should be able to put whatever they want into their bodies.
<LI>Drugs other than alcohol are fine on occasion (once or twice a month) and alcohol is great when used in control and where a person is responsible (ie. designated driver).
<LI>Quit talking about a drug war unless we really plan to fight one.
<LI>All humans innately possess the desire to excape the mundane; some do it with drugs/alcohol; some do it by exercise, television, computer games, or other "socially acceptable" outlet.  I believe some persons have a genetic predisposition for substance addiction.  Early education and intervention is needed---but we will never completely eradicate the problem.
<LI>I feel pot might help as a medicine for some people.
<LI>Well, a lot of drugs in my opinion should be legalized, LSD, Marijuana, Peyote, Extacy, and a few others. Drugs like cocaine, heroin, those and more other needle drugs are fairly stupid and should remain illegal. I think kids parents (Not the government, 
<LI>drugs use is caused by the need to escape and creates a large problem for those of us who want to escape to a stoner-less civilization
<LI>illegal drugs should be wiped off the face of the earth.
<LI>As along as it doesn't hurt anybody else, why should they care.
<LI>I think a lot of it is due to peer pressure and intimidation. I think that curiosity, unhappiness, and depression can also motivate people to use drugs.
<LI>The best way to regulate is to legalize.
<LI>I think our ethics and morals too much cloud our sensibility and logic. I think the people who make the laws have no first hand experience and as such don't know what the hell they're dealing with. I think addictive drugs that clearly have a negative impact should be illegal but many currently banned drugs do not fit this discription. Down with religious, self-rightious SOB's!
<LI>As long is it doens't hurt someone else a person should be able to do with their body what they want
<LI>I think we need to understand *why* people use drugs, then work from that to cure the disease, not the symptoms.
<LI>While I did not check "legalize" for the spectrum of drugs, I strongly believe criminal enforcement is ineefective in dealing with drug problems.
<LI>The War on Some Drugs is doing a great deal of damage to this country.  It is a mistake.  A war cannot be won without an army.  There is no army with which to fight the War on Some Drugs.  We are loosing.  We will never win this war.  We should cut our losses now and give up.  Continuing the War on Some Drugs is insane.  Prohabition didn't work.  The only winners are the dealers.
<LI>do no time for a victimless crime...
<LI>I agree smoking pot and drinking alcohol
<LI>i'm a college graduate, employed and i pay my bills and taxes.  occasionally i smoke marijuana and i'm ok.  i've never harmed anyone and wouldn't think of it.  the media likes to scare people.
<LI>I just want to say that a person has to be strong willed if their going to experiment with drugs and alcohol because it can take over your mind , body and soul without you even realizing that it happened until it's too late! I was a heavy drug user at one time and now it caught up to me even though I kicked it on my own. I now have Hepititus C and only have a few years to live because of something that i did 13 years prior, I'm now 38 and I feel that my life has just begun and here I feel that I got kn
cked back down! Since being diagnosed with Hep C (3 years ago) I no longer drink either. Now that I'm straight all the time I see the people that I use to drink with and see how alcohol affects a persons personality, But I have to say that I do miss drinking socialbly. That all I have to say about the topic.  Thanks thelenster :)
<LI>no one has the right to tell me what i can do with my own body or mind. we need proper education and regulation so people can make sensible informed decisions.
<LI>Most drugs-Bad Keep laws same- Education is best -
<LI>America is amazing; it professes to have so many "freedoms," yet it is probably the most tightly regulated country with regard to drugs and alcohol. Nicotine is proven to be addictive and harmful, and it is still freely available. Marijuana is not addictive, but it is illegal.
<LI>Particularly in the United States, the problem with soft drugs (specifically alcohol and marijuana) is immaturity about use.  Having a drinking age of 21 and an entering college age of 18 is ridiculous, and is merely a way of pretending the problem doesn't exist.  If the drinking age were lowered to 18, or a British-style 16-if-you're-with-parents, then there'd be less binge drinking in college and later life, as there would have been an eduacational process.  With regards to marjuana, I feel that it i
 essentially a harmless drug, if it does somewhat decrease productivity by causing a shorting of attention span, but that this should be the user's problem, not the government.  It causes less damage socially than alcohol, and making it illegal only gives criminal records and makes the police force spend time on otherwise innocent upstanding citizens.
<LI>Most drugs should be legalized but controlled by the government.  Tax it, have farmers grow it instead of NOTHING, why is it that school teachers and 7-11 clerks are being given drug tests and not doctors or lawyers?  Of course, it won't be easy but eventually we will be victorious!

<LI>Answer to experience w/ alcohol: mostly beer and wine.  Answer to thoughts on drug testing: should only be legal as part of an investigation into a crash (airplane, train, etc.) causing death or injury.
<LI>drugs/alcohol are the cancer that eats at our civilization and without strickter regulations we are useless
<LI>It's hard for me to imagine being addicted to drugs because of the crappy feeling I get after drinking or smoking. I wish people would try to stronger.
<LI>Alcohol is no good,drugs not for medical use are for losers.
<LI>It wasn't very exciting to me. *shrug*
<LI>If we raise people to think responsibly, they will act responsibly.
<LI>Too many people are in jail for drug related crimes.  They should decrimalize drugs, empty the jails of drug users so there would be more room for the child moslesters, rapes, murderers, white collar crimials and politians.
<LI>Drugs and Alcohol should be regulated but that should be available as they are in places like England, I only reffer to the non addivting drugs.
<LI>I feel that drugs should be legalized and sold through doctors and so forth for a very low price per usage.  This would eliminate the majority of the street pushers and cut down on crime and violence.
<LI>Drugs outside of a health care environment is not right and it all needs to be requlated and controlled more.
<LI>If some jerk want to ruin his/her life with drugs, then so be it.  Personally, I don't care to have my tax dollars wasted trying to stop idiots from being idiots!
<LI>that if drugs are addicting and KILL then why take them for a short rush, in all the time people spend taking drugs they could be enjoying life on the otherside, I mean there's two sides to the picture.
<LI>Drugs are very evil substances and the people who take them deserve the punishment they get years later for taking them(side effects).
<LI>Legalization of drugs would eliminate the high profit which encourages violent criminals to engage in drug trafficking. It didn't work for alcohol in the 20's and its not working now.
<LI>I'm a libertarian, I think everything should be legal, and everyone should be responsible for their own action. I also think though that I should have the right to shoot anyone freaked out on them under any self-defense conditions
<LI>We can't stop others from harming themselves only from harming others
<LI>I believe that drug and drug usage has many different ramifications.  There are those who can and can't deal with them in an adult manner.  I do believe that a different attitude by society concerning drugs and alcohol could possibly change some problems; take the European countries for instance, alcohol consumption is looked at differently and their alcoholism rate is reported lower than in the U.S. 
<LI>Drugs and alcohol STINK!!!  They should both be against the law.  
<LI>End the war on drugs, and we wouldn't have a war on crime either.  Legalize adulthood!
<LI>where it is against the law, enforce the law to the fullest.
<LI>The War on Some Drugs has been a colosal failure.  No good has come of it.  It has greatly increased crime and government power over the indivdual.
<LI>I have become comfortably numb.
<LI>it is a complete freedom of choice and shouldn't be messed with espically the government
<LI>Drugs should not be readily avaiable to the general public.  Drugs are destroying our youth in America.
<LI>Overuse is wrong
<LI>The drug war  is the most detrimental  domestic policy in US  history
<LI>I think that alcohol and cigorettes aren't THAT bad ( but they're not good) However, I do feel that harder drugs are very bad
<LI>I don't approve of the use of currently illegal drugs but the federal government has no Constitutional authority to regulate it except as it's use may affect the work performance if federal employees or as it's use by federal employees may affect national security.  If an individual wants to accept the consequences of drug useage, let them use it.  I also believe that if an employer or landlord disapproves of it's use then they have the right to fire or evict the users.
<LI>Take the money out of drugs by legalization. Yes, a few more might OD and afew more might be come addicted, BUT the crime rate (druggies burgaling, etc.) would drop and the general population would benefit far more.
<LI>Drugs are an excellent way to screw up your and possibly someone else's life.
<LI>n/a
<LI>Laws against drugs cause more problems than the drugs do.  Alcohol is most deadly drug and causes the most problems. De-criminaliztion makes most sense for drugs currently illegal and more severe penalties for DUI and other traffic incidents involving drugs.  Drugs/alcohol and driving of any kind do not mix.  Tolerance and education key to curbing usage. 
<LI>Some people will always want more, some will say they should be banned implicitly, and the rest of us are sensible enough to know when to quit while we are still enjoying the benefits
<LI>Determination of one's level of maturity is the key to the use of alcohol and with some drugs, while education about the harmful affects of the more addictive drugs should be stressed.
<LI>I hate paying a Dr.Visit everytime I need drugs. When I know what works on my body, I should be able to get anything without a prescription.  I don't want to go to a Dr. unless I need their advice, but a Pharmacist usually knows more about how drugs work than Dr.s.
<LI>I think that if the drugs and alcohol are used wisley and in a safe invironment then there is nothing wrong with them.  I think that if you know you will not become addicted to them then there should be no limits. To many people think that it is an excape from reality and thats not how they should be used.No drugs should be a goal of anyone that cares but more then likly it will happen. If you are smart it will not happen often.  All major drugs like cocain and other drugs that are highly dangerous to 
our health should not be legal. I thinkthat the major problem with people today is that they do not use them wisely or for the right reason.I do agree that major drugs should be illegal. They are to deadly not to be.
<LI>Drugs have destroyed SO many lives (and brain cells).  Why someone would seek to do this to themselves is something I find hard to understand- and how our society PRODUCES so many people who feel it is the answer saddens me- and makes me fearful for the future.
<LI>moderation is the key!
<LI>People need to escape sometimes. Drugs provide that. I don't believe that legalizing marijuana is going to have a negative effect on our society. So many people use it and I believe it's alot less dangerous than alcohol, which is legal.
<LI>The War on drugs has claimed more lives, caused more crime and misery than drug use.
<LI>Hard drugs while not desirable as a recreational tool should be legalises if for no other reason than to minimise drug related crime
<LI>As long as drugs are used and not abused (used to excess or in a way that harms the user or other people) I think that it is fine.
<LI>I truly believe alcohol is far more dangerous than many organic types of drugs and that if alcohol is legal, these types of drugs should at least be decriminalized
<LI>I think that it is scary seeing kids at my school believe drugs to be fun and rebellous.  I wish they could see themselves in ten years
<LI>drugs are for the birds
<LI>I believe in free access and use of drugs, but without government support for rehabilitation or any other aid.
<LI>Drug are powerful and can be quite dangerous, but government restrictions are useless. People take drugs to releive physical pain and emotional stress.  The fact that so many people are abusing drug should be telling us that there is something wrong with 
<LI>I've seen drugs mess up a lot of peoples lives. I don't think they should be regulated out of anger or hatred but I am for makeing them have harsh regulations out of compation.
<LI>It's when drugs and alcohol make us stupid (i.e. more than any small/moderate amount) that it gets out of hand.
<LI>If used moderately some drugs can be good. Just like anything else if done in excess, it can be a problem.
<LI>drugs use was  the biggest waste of time and money in my personal experance, I don't recomend it for anyone.
<LI>I think alcohol should be available at a younger age.  Younger people drink anyways and it is not as harsh as drugs.
<LI>drugs can be used as a tool.  If there is a problem with drugs/alcohol, the problem was already there and has only been amplified.  We need to treat addicts as medical cases, not criminals.  Drugs should be legalized, not just decriminalized.  There is far too much violence and pain brought about by the need for it already.
<LI>I do not feel that any additional drugs should be legalized since we now have a huge problem with the drugs we have now that are legal.  The cost to society is too great.
<LI>I am not a frequent user of drugs or particularly addicted to any one drug, however I enjoy injecting certain drugs on occassions purely for the enjoyment of the effects of the drug and in my opinion certain more addictive drugs such as cocaine are much more enjoyable and less affective than say alcohol which is legal. The real criminals here are the pushers. If drugs were readily available people like myself who use the drugs for enjoyment would not be made look like criminals when in effect we are ju
t taking another drug such as alcohol or nicotine which are legal and readily available.
<LI>I don't understand how people can use them or abuse them. We all know what bad stuff they do to our bodies.
<LI>i think in one year the death penalty should go into effect for  big time dealers.  it's time we take our country back.
<LI>I think drugs end up doing more harm when illegal; Legalized marijuana could make money for the government, keep people out of crowded prisons, reduce deaths in many circumstances, and respect personal freedoms.
<LI>Drugs and alcohol cause too much damage to society-they should be illegal.  Users, especially drunk drivers should do some SERIOUS time!!
<LI>Drugs should not be legalized.
<LI>Drugs have always been with us; the "drug problem" is, however, a creation of the government, because prohibition has created a highly profitable business, a dependent underclass, a corrupt law enforcement system, an obscene crime problem, abrogation of the Bill of Rights, and a class of cynical political beneficiaries.  The phenomenon of a few individuals who addict themselves to something is insignificant in comparison to all this politically-created misery.
<LI>The worst drug is tobacco.  Why doesn't this survey address the horrendous, tragic effects of tobacco?  Drugs and alcohol deaths combined do not kill as many people as cigarettes.  Cigarette use by teens often leads to drug use.
<LI>Maturity and Age are the key factor before using any drug!
<LI>Just say no.  Shoot lab owners.  Jail dealers. Jail smugglers.
<LI>I feel that certain drug use is bad. Personally, I believe that someone who uses on a daily basis, who has to fulfill an addiction, is definately bad. They have a big problem, and need to seek help, or have someone else seek help for them. Another main opinion I have about using drugs, is that if you are going to experiment when you are young to have a little fun, and try new things, have a blast. However, there comes a time, such as when a person has to GROW UP and be responsible for themselves as an 
ndependant and/or their family. I personally use marijuana when with friends at times, and consume alcohol when going to parties with friends. But once I enter my career and graduate from college, I will no longer use marijuana, although I may have a drink or two from time to time socially. 
<LI>I think drugs are nasty (hard drugs) and people shouldn't do drugs.
<LI>Alcohol/drug education programs should begin very early in school,and should continue for as long as people are in school.
<LI>Drugs are a way to mask are toubles,feelings and fears.It's amasing how much the problem is truely mis representedo or maybe its just denial. d
<LI>Drugs shoud be managed by the goverment and given out like a perscription tobacco to lsd and manadge by medical personal
<LI>Drugs are not good.  However, the US Government isn't tour mommy.  Whether or not you use drugs is your business, unless you endanger others through your behaivour.
<LI>I think that certain drugs (such as marajuana) should be legalized and that taxation of these substances would both give money to the government, taking it away from the drug dealers, but I wonder if the regulation of marajuana (or other drugs) is very tight, wouldn't the black market just stay?  I do however believe that, as drug trafficking is a business, the government needs to get into it - fight fire with fire!
<LI>what is the purpose of this survey?
<LI>Certain people in society have an inclination to be dependent on drugs or alcohol; it can be inherited; one's upbringing helps play a role in the use of drugs and alcohol
<LI>Everyone, once they reach the adult stage, has the right to decide for THEIRSELVES, whether or not THEY want to get involved with drugs.  That's fine.  Encouraging others is shady.  Encouraging minors is even more so.  Dealing should be done with responsibility, but that will never happen.  Education is one way to deal with it.  Drug USE should not be a crime.  DEALING should.
<LI>people use it anyway...so legalize the lesss damaging as marijuana..that way you keep it under control and is the step to hard drugs as cocaine a bigger one
<LI>I think an educated distinction must be made between recreational use by mature, functioning members of society and sociological issues that drive addiction and inhibit full integration into our economy.
<LI>Legalize and tax marijuana so that money raised can be used for education and drug treatment.  People use drugs/alcohol to mask problems.  It is time to face our problems.
<LI>all drugs including nicotine and alcohol should be illegal
<LI>most substanced that are illegal now should stay that way
<LI>Drugs should be available to anyone any age as with alcohol
<LI>i only tried alcohol once, it was a sip of my parents' wine, but, YUCK!!!!!how disgusting i never ever want to do anything involving consumable alcohol again, how can any of you lunatics like it? it even smells disgusting(except rum, rum smells great but i expect it tastes horrible)
<LI>what a complete and total waste of my time amd money, and i risked my live and the lives of others just for a good buzz. if i had to do over again i would not touch any of it!
<LI>Quit supporting the drug pushers and legalize whatever people are going to use and tax the hell out of it .Use the money to balance the budget and education
<LI>I think prescription drugs should be tightly regulated. I think doctors give pain pills and narcotics to freely. Drug abusers should be rehabilitated and if that does not work, lock them all up together with a few vials of crack and kill each other over it. Drug abusers are of no use to society.
<LI>I don't think it's a major middle-class problem.  To the extent that drug use is a problem among the poor, we should be addressing greater problems such as unemployment and lack of education.
<LI>the present 'war on drugs' only excerbates our authority problems, disrespect for law, murder and theft rates, etc. the government should get out of the drugs question. businesses, however, should consider drug use with other job-pertinent characteristics of (potential) employees. the 'problem' comes from our reaction, not from the drugs. we need to relax and develop a more mature understanding than 'Just Say No'.
<LI>i am a recovering addict...have been clean for 6 years....drugs are easy to get and easy to keep however if the govt. legalized certain drugs they would be very rich 
<LI>It's cool and it makes captin Kirk go up.
<LI>It's a serious problem.
<LI>Amsterdam seems to have the right idea.
<LI>They're fine, if the individual can handle the psychological and social effects.
<LI>Any legal drug such as caffeen, alcohol, tobacco, etc. should stay legal and let people have a designated driver with alcohol and let people smoke if they want but not in public.  Let there be smoking restaurants and non-smoking restaurants.  Let people have a free choice.  Drunk Drivers caught driving drunk should be punished severly and make sure tobacco is only sold to people over 21 and strictly enforce this.
<LI>Depends on what you consider drugs.  I don't consider alcohol, caffine or nicitine a drug.  But I feel all highly addictive drugs should be regulated
<LI>I believe that people should be free to do with their own body whatever they like in private as long as it will not injure anyone else in any way.  I also believe suicide should be legal (not done, but legal still).
<LI>The above answer sums up best my thoughts on drug/alcohol use
<LI>I think that usage should be completely ok if the use isn't abused.  If people are responsible in their actions than it is their problem.  If it gets out of hand than the abusers need to be helped.
<LI>I've had several experiences with drugs and alcohol and even was addicted to it for some time about 4 years ago but I realised that this should not be a good way for me to get away from my problems and I don't want to become like my father's side of the family. Now, I will only drink maybe once a month but not for the "effects" anymore and I rarely smoke "marijuana" now. 
<LI>There are times I believe that legalizing drugs would stem the problem.  At least it would get rid of the scum making money, and there would be standards established by the industry on quality.
<LI>The government should control and regulate all drugs.
<LI>Drugs is an artificial source of pleasure.  They are used by people who are too stupid to find ways to have fun on their own.  It is hard to convince users of the dangers of drugs, but if you look at the kind of people who are committing acts of violence 
<LI>Drugs in and of themselves are not a problem.  Some people can develop problems, but this should be treated as a health/psychological problem not a criminal one.  There are far too many people in jail now for drug-related crimes.  Let's save jail for peop
<LI>I have smoked marijuana on occasion and gotten delightfully stoned each time. However, I would never feel comfortable in any so-called drug subculture. I am interested in using herbs for medicinal and recreational purposes, but I am very uncomfortable wit
<LI>Legalize, tax the heck out of it, state distribution (gives a quality guarantee), some jobs where other lives are at risk(pilot, etc) should not be used on the job, if so, stiff penalties !
<LI>The War on (Some) Drugs creates more problems than it could possibly solve.  All drugs should be relegalized, thus cutting the drug profiteers off at the knees.  Law enforcement should focus on real criminals: murders, rapists and thieves.  Realistic impairment testing would be far superior to any form of drug testing.
<LI>certain drugs should be legalized, such as marijuana, but i like the way drugs are basically treated here.  It makes it hard for people to overdo drugs, yet its easy to experiment
<LI>I am only 11 years of age, but even I am more into what President Clinton is doing to lock the drug dealers
<LI>There are many weak people in society who can't handle either drugs or alcohol.  When these individuals consume these substances they have great potential to do harm to innocent members of society.  If it were not for this potential to do harm to innocents, my opinion would be to allow these individuals to consume as much of whatever substance they want until they no longer present a danger to the innocent members of society.  In other words, I would allow alcoholics or junkies to consume as much as th
y want as long as enough fees are collected on the sale of these substances to dispose of their bodies when they have completely ruined them and died.  I consider this the Darwinian/Kevorkian approach to drug control.  The penalty for stupidity throughout history has been death.  If the stupid want to kill themselves, who am I to stop them?  But, I will not let their stupidity to kill or harm innocent others.  
<LI>The drug war should be ended.
<LI>humans seem to be driven to alter their reality.  there are no victims other than those created by the war on drugs.
<LI>you have to control what you do not let it control you
<LI>I recommend that all the parents out there with kids sit down and tell them, "Yes, I did drugs" and "Yes, they can be fun" and "I expect you to be responsible in your decisions about them." IN THAT ORDER
<LI>I see no need for them in my life, so I don't understand why anyone else would.  Alcohol taskes gross, so why drink it?  Some drugs are medically neccessary and should be legalized only for that purpose.  Harsher penalties for drug dealers, and a global crack-down of drug-producing countries should be put into effect to solve the problems.
<LI>things like marijuana and lsd should be legalized for use in "trip bars" like the hash bars of amsterdam.  Under controlled circumstances, these experiences can be very insiteful.  Education is the key
<LI>people can use but not too often
<LI>Addicts commit crimes, but are not criminals!  Reform the judicial process accordingly.  No legalization until there are better support systems to educate and emotionally bolster our young people.
<LI>The Healing of America from drug desastor, must start in the Heart of Man! It cannot be legislated, or ever controled, until mankind has a real Heart change! It must happen from the inside out!
<LI>People need to learn how to manage stress, so they won't turn to drugs and alcohol.
<LI>Need to examine the reasons why we seek escape, relaxation, etc. by artificial means
<LI>Well, I like the idea of legalizing weed, but I dont like the idea of the government paying for the rehabilitation of drug users, I figure we should all be allowed to do whatever we want if it doesnt harm anyone else, but I also believe the government shouldnt be taking care of us, we should be taking care of our selves, if we are responsible enough to take care of our selves, then we are responsible enough to be allowed to have weed...
<LI>The United states has more drug users in jail than any other country.Treatment is a better alternative to jail and should be used more often
<LI>End the insane drug war NOW
<LI>I'ts our real national shame,  the conspiricy of silence, whats the body count from the drug war from our citys' streets?  Probhition, Elliot Ness, Frank Nitty, Surplant Drugs instead of Illegal Booze, and you have exactly what you have today gangs (gangsters) organized crime, drive-by shootings, the slaughter of the innocents over the profiteering og the drug dealers; and or the posturiung of govt & its cronies who depend on the war monies for their  livelyhood.  Who is the good guys? you dont know an
more
<LI>Decriminalize the use of drugs.  Take the high profits enjoyed by gangs and criminals in the distribution of drugs by permitting the sale of drugs through conventional wholesale and retail channels.
<LI>It's a matter of inner culture whether drugs become a problem or not.
<LI>Drug&alcohol usage is indicative of a collapsing social order. Personal responibility for a strong/safe community has been undermined by the corruption of the judicial,executive&legislative systems. In otherwords our government is corrupt. They are suppose to lead by example as are parents. When justice and honesty are lost so are the people of that society. 
<LI>Altered states are just that. Unatural and not needed. But we do it anyway.
<LI>War on Drugs is a complete failure. Legalize drugs and end welfare, which subsudizes drug abuse, and you will see a decrease in drug use.
<LI>More regulation.
<LI>Alcohol and tobacco are the lifeline of rednecks and wife beaters. Both should be regulated by the FDA.
<LI>Personal responsibility should be the only requirement for a persons actions, drugs/alcohol included
<LI>They are "crutches" for the weak that turn into real disabilities.
<LI>As Mark Twain once said--Moderation is the key to everything, including moderation
<LI>i dont know, i just dont know

<H2 align=CENTER>What are your thoughts on drugs/drug usage?</H2>

<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_DRUGS -->
<LI>There's a big difference between use and abuse and everyone should know their limits.
<LI>Hey-take what you can handle, don't do what you can't.  I happen to have a very low tolerance for alcohol, but I know people who can knock down a few rounds and still drive home.  Too bad for me, good for them.  I know what my limitations are, and I proceed accordingly.  Why can't we all do that?
<LI>Drugs and alcohol are an important part of society, and create order in the place of chaos!
<LI>It seems to be a natural mammalian drive to alter consciousness; there should be research into simple, safe highs; addiction to strong and dangerous drugs is a health issue.  Drugs are inappropriate for developing children.  I'm not taken with the few dru
<LI>Teenagers need to be educated more about drugs.  Including what they look like, how it feels, how to use certain drugs and so on to stop them from being so curious.
<LI>Dumb survey!
<LI>I know drugs (including alcohol) can be used in a responsible way, and with better education about the positives of drug use and experience is the key to a healthy, responsible, creative, understanding, and promising future.
<LI>I think that soft drugs should be legalized, but that penalties for  sale of hard drugs should be severe.
<LI>There are numerous misspellings on this page
<LI>Drugs should be decriminalized. The War On Drugs has failed!
<LI>I think that drugs and alcohol can be extremely destructive, therefore they should only be consumed/used in moderation.
<LI>Decriminalise, tax, licence, and regulate
<LI>doesnt affect me .let the idiots kill them selves
<LI>only an idiot does it
<LI>I think that public focus is somewhat blurred on this issue. Too much time is spent depating the legailzation/illegalization of pot, cigatettes, and the like, but no one says anything about alcohol, which, in my opinion is just as dangerous, if not more so than some other drugs.
<LI>I believe that if we really want to fight use of illegal substances in this country that we need to do it here -- on the demand side.  Educational programs need to be enhanced, society needs to make it clear that use of illegal substances is unacceptable.  Programs need to be made widely available to deal with addiction.  After all that, penalties for use need to be increased substantially and penalties for dealing need to be harsher -- especially to minors.  
<LI>I think the cost of treatment should be reduced. I think mandatory participation in AA (a religious organization) as ordered by courts, should be banned.
<LI>Drugs are not the problem its peoples abuse of them that is the problem.  Although its a big sociological/legal question these days I think their influence on us is amazing.
<LI>i thinck drugs like pot should be legal.alcohol should be illegal.pot dose not depress your sensese like alcohol .and it is non adictive
<LI>people do drugs. we should do our best to help people with problems, but not by punishing them.
<LI>Outlawing drugs results in more damage to society than the drugs themselves.
<LI>THE USE OF ANY DRUG FOR ANY PURPOSE IS A PERSONAL CHOICE AND A PERSONAL OPINION.  I BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT ABUSE OF THESE DRUGS CONSTITUTES A REAL PROBLEM.  LEGALIZATION OF ANY DRUG AT THIS TIME WILL ONLY LEAD TO INCREASED ABUSE TO THE POINT IN WHICH OUR SOCIETY WILL BE NOTHING BUT A BUNCH OF STONED DEAD HEADS.  WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP THE CHILDREN IN MIND.  PROVIDE THEM WITH THE EDUCATION OF DRUGS AND DRUG ABUSE. MOST IMPORTANTLY, PROVIDE THEM WITH A FUTURE TO LOOK FORWARD TO IN WHICH THEY CAN BE PROUD.  
 BELIEVE MOST DRUG ABUSE STEMS FROM TRYING TO BREAK AWAY FROM REALITY, MAINLY A REALITY THAT HAS NO FUTURE! 
<LI>I THINK IT IS REALLY SAD WHAT THIS WORLD IS BECOMING
<LI>restricting drug use only caters to the monopoly of drug lords and artificially inflates prices. All drugs should be legal, but we need freely available treatment centers where addicts can be helped.
<LI>I think tighter and harsher punishment needs to be made on drug users and suppliers
<LI>I don't use drugs, but I think that if you're stupid enough to kill your self, then that's one less person competing in my job market (just don't expect money from me)
<LI>To put a person in prison whose only offense is that they smoked marijuana in the privacy of their own home is ludicrous. Our policing efforts should be directed towards crimes that have a victim(other than the self) and the freedom to make our own choices shouldn't be undermined 'for our own good'. It is difficult to comprehend why marijuana is illegal when every major study has concluded that is has significant medicinal value, has little or no side effects, causes no long-term harm and is non-addict
ve.
<LI>Natural drugs for lack of better words, have been proven over many centuries to be helpful for medicinal purposes and for social interaction as well, keep in mind that marajuana was only outlawed because big business found better less efficient ways to pollute and rape our land.  Hemp is 30% more efficient that standard paper. LEGALIZE MARAJUANA
<LI>People do what they want. Drug legalization would lower the crime rate significantly.
<LI>drug dealers and organized drug groups should be severly punished
<LI>n/a
<LI>Like I picked I think that education is the key to dealing with the problems
<LI>out of all drugs i think the one i hate most is marijuana.  mainly because it soaccepted by so many.  i believe that on can reach a trance like state without the aid of a drug.  just don't sleep.
<LI>use of any drug has a potential for danger,some more so than others.the most dangerous aspect is the unpredictability of each individual reaction i personally used pot regularly for 5 yrs. and never developed an addiction, with alcohol, however, the addiction was almost immediate and to this day i still cannot drink. thats the bitch about drugs you never know what you will become addicted to or to what degree.
<LI>Drugs are a dangerous thing.  There should be more education for children and maybe even more scare tacktics to keep them from ever trying drugs.
<LI>Legalising marajuana would eliminate a lot of criminals income!
<LI>Govt ought to get tough and impose stiffer penalties like death for peddlars. After all, drugs do kill eg drug war, ODs, crime to feed habit etc
<LI>I don't approve of drugs use.  
<LI>I think drugs and alcohol are too easy to get.  It seems like anyone can get crack, cocaine, and marijuana.  Alcohol is also way too easy for minors to buy.  Most people in my high school drink and they get beer easily.
<LI>I think alcohol has done more damage to our society than all other drugs put together.
<LI>Drug and alcohol abuse causes more pain to the user and his/her loved ones than is possible to describe.  I know of NOONE who's life has been either enriched or ennobled by substance abuse.
<LI>DRUGS LEAD TO NOTHING BUT MISTAKES AND HEARTACHE
<LI>I believe that the misuse of some drugs has overshadowed the benefits of those same drugs, causing them to become more stringently regulated, and thus unavailable to those who would medically benefit from them.
<LI>Most drugs  are horrible, but such dugs that do have immeadiate drastic effects i.e. marajuana should not me condemed.
<LI>I just lost my Aunt to a Drug Abuser and I think that the laws need to be tightened on the way we deal with all alchol and drug abusers.  It is everybodys problem.  Not just the victims and their families.
<LI>I think it's actually a bad idea to use ANY drugs(including alcohol) frequently...however, I don't judge people who do, and I think SOMETIMES even Marijuana can have positive effects especially medicinally.  I have no positive feelings towards heroine, cocaine, etc..there should be tougher penalties for those drugs.  Mental health drugs are very important for sick people.
<LI>MOST drugs should be legal.  I am not a user but I believe the less deadly ones should be sold, and the government could make a profit like they do on ciggarettes.
<LI>legalizing hard drugs would not significantly help the resulting societal problems.  I would support the legalization of marijuana, but I would like to see tobacco made illegal, since it is so harmful to health.
<LI>NO COMMENT
<LI>I have only tried alcohol (which is the most harmful drug I have taken) but have been offered marijuana and didn't take it. I believe that our society of today say it's okay to drink,smoke, do hard drugs(alcohol,marijuan,cocaine,crack,etc..) - that it won't hurt you but in reality it's addicting and will eventually kill you. Our leaders, role models, parents,etc.. have lost their morals too - the whole slogan of America is that we're 'free' and can do anything we want. It's too bad because things are g
tting worse day by day and drugs (hard types) are taking us further down the road. Thanks for the surveys - this is pretty cool. By the way - I am 26, white male - if this helps.
<LI>It's stupid, it ruwens youre whole life. It damages youre brains.
<LI>Alcohol and nicotine are worse drugs than pot . I would rather have my  young daughter smoke pot than smoke cigarettes
<LI>Do what you want as long as you don't interfere with others.  If you do intefere with others, there should be a strict punishment.  This is the price of freedom.
<LI>It's sad to see people completely demolished by hard drugs.
<LI>Some should be legalized, but just put restraints on them; like alcohol
<LI>CASUAL USE ON TV & IN NEWSPAPERS HURT; EXAMPLE WORKS
<LI>same answer as #16
<LI>Almost everyone in every culture uses drugs. There's nothing wrong with that. Drugs can lead to problems, but it's never only the drug but also social and psychic circumstances that determine whether the consumption of drugs becomes a problem.
<LI>I think that smoking cigarrettes should be banned.
<LI>none
<LI>social cost of restricting the drug and the damage the drug could give should be considered in a more realistic manner
<LI>The term Drugs has a wide variety of meanings, but for the sake of arguement, They should be legalized. If they are hindering your performance, so here is an example of social darwinism, good for me ,bad for you!
<LI>When you combine alcohol, cigaretts, perscription drugs and other drugs in your survey you muddy the waters.
<LI>some drugs should be legallized,the ones that aren't addicting like pot,   
<LI>I was very comfortable with marijuana and alcohol for years until it threatened my chances of success.  With drugs and alcohol, I never focused on what is important in my life.  I have a loving fiance now, a business ready to start soon, a new job full of oppurtunities, and I am living life, happier, healthier, and much fuller without the smoking and drinking.  JUST SAY NO, I DID <--my message to all those who might read this. exactly.
<LI>I think certain drugs should be legalized, but only if they are helpful in some sort of medicinal way
<LI>moderation is the key
<LI>If alcohol is legal marijuana should be also, especially for medicinal purposes. there are plenty of fatalities due to alcohol but not very many due to weed
<LI>Drug and drug usage is practically impossible to regulate in a governmental way.  Instead, it should be first and foremost dealt with in the home, and them school.  In North America the alcohol laws are too strict and often only arise because drinking under age is "Bad" and "Rebellious" and "cool".
<LI>it all depends on the person
<LI>I feel that children and teens are unaware of the effects/harm drugs can(may) cause now and (or) in the future.
<LI>Everything in moderation....if not, then don't do it.
<LI>Drugs and alcohol are a waste of life.
<LI>I think that drugs (not alcohol) should not be legalized in the U.S., for medical reasons it should be used, but not for recreation.
<LI>Drugs are very good as long as they are not over used. All drugs should be legalized especially marijuana.  Anyone who thinks that drugs are evil has had the governmant take over their mind. 
<LI>marijuana should be legal but nothing beyond that.
<LI>They should not be legalized and heavy penalities for those who bring it across our borders.
<LI>I don't use any drugs now, other than prescriptions.  I am only a social drinker. Though I don't have any problems with these substances, I know many people do.  I'm not sure what the "answer" to this societal problem is!!
<LI>I believe we need to address peer pressure first, then people would be able to make up their own minds. The choices I make are my own.. I think everyone should be the same way. 
<LI>I generally do not PERSONALLY approve of the using of drugs stronger than, say, caffeine. But I am ADAMANTLY opposed to the idea that laws against drugs have any place in our society. Laws against drugs are the best way to make the problem explode, as has been shown by our experience. So I am opposed to drugs, but respect people's right to use them if they choose (including minors); but I am far MORE opposed to anti-drug LAWS.
<LI>OUr society sends very mixed messages about alcohol use. I support drug legalization in order to take the profit motive from drug trade. Rehab services should be MUCH more freely available to any addicts who wish them.
<LI>We should not regulate what people do to themselves unless they are a danger to others, but any laws on the books should be enforced.
<LI>The U.S. should have much stricter and more consistent punishment for drug related crimes.  No tolerance!  While in Istanbul I talked to some men about drug problems in America.  They think our government is stupid for remaining so tolerant.  There your are either dead or wish you were within one week of  being caught with the drugs.
<LI>a nice road to self-destruction...
<LI>All drugs should be legal and huge taxes put on them.
<LI>The key is education, and harsher penalties for dealers.
<LI>Drugs deteriorate human's minds; I know through experience.  WHATEVER needs to be done to stop drug usage, should be done.  I dont know what that would be, but...
<LI>drug users are like alcoholics--they need a crutch
<LI>"ills" has two els. The drug war is about the most useless thing for the common man. The government, however, is making itself into a major growth industry by using the farce of a drug war to justify its police powers.
<LI>good stuff
<LI>Legalization of drugs would alleviate many of the crime problems in America today.  Drugs are a very serious problem, but incarceration is not the most effective way to deal with abusers.  Just remember this: no Prohibition, no Al Capone.
<LI>Drugs such as marijuana are ok in small amounts and would be ok to be legalized but other drugs are harmful and should be more strictly regulated.
<LI>I don't like drugs or the usage of drugs.  I have had many frineds die or become totally different from the use of drugs.  It is sad and scary to watch and know thta you can only try to help them but htat thye have to want to get off...
<LI>The HYPOCRACY stinks.How any substance GOD put on this earth can be made punishable by man is beyond understanding.( marijuana, coca leaf, mushrooms, peyote, popies, etc...)
<LI>clean and sober is cool
<LI>Drug usage is a personal issue and Government regulation is an intrusion on our Inalienable Rights.  Some people use drugs as an escape for their problems and addiction can become an additional problem, however Government prohibition only makes the problems worse.
<LI>drugs should be decriminalized, thus getting the criminal elements out of the picture
<LI>Due to a multitude of physical ailments, my pain levels are high (excuse the pun) and my ability to be a pleasent and productive person are severely limited. Alchohol offers no real relief and the side affects are to severe(i.e. addiction and desease).With no truthfull education available,to many people are left to experiment with drugs they know nothing about. With an unconcienable drug war going in, to many good and harmless people are turned into criminals and the people who are misled into hating t
em are taxed into slavery. Putting the UNCONSTITUTIONAL drug war aside, the reality of the situation is that if drugs were legal, crime (i.e. shootings and robbery) would mostly disappear. If legel and taxed, drugs could be a valuable source of revenue for ANY treatment program that would be needed to help and educate any person who unfortunately gets into trouble with them. That is why I say," TAX MY BAG, NOT MY FREEDOM". PLEASE, from all of us in pain and overstressed, rethink your objections and try to 
elp. Thank you and remember,no pot smoker ever did the nasty crap drunks do ------- we're to mellow for anything involving violence. Thank you and God Bless.                   
<LI>all drugs should be outllaed dearh pently for dealer and suppliers
<LI>it's such a huge problem, and so prevalent throughout society that no one is willing to admit it and start dealing with the problem
<LI>I think that as long as drugs are not abused, then it is fine for people to use them.  It is a personal choice that everyone has to make.
<LI>Drugs are one of the most deadly thing young people can try.
<LI>There has always been and will always be drug usage - legal and illegal. America is repeating its mistakes "prohibition" is here again - only instead of alcohol it is "drug."  We need to learn from our previous mistakes and "call off the war on drugs."  We have created the criminals in this war, just as we created the criminals during prohibition.  The American people and its government has to stop "beating a dead horse," what we are doing (in the name of saving our society) is destroying America.  I p
rsonally feel that the "war on drug" has been created by the "elite group" who wish to prey upon the poor and underprivileged in our society.  It is a sad day in our society when we are building more jails than schools.
<LI>In a capitolist society, nothing can be truly banned.  We are in an age where prohibition is unsuccessfully being tried a second time.  Drugs are a personal matter and should not be subjected to public scrutiny.  The drug war produces artificially high prices and creates violence.  The drug war itself is much worse than the drugs.  Either we live in a free society or we don't, we can't have semi-freedom.  I would rather that addicts have access to cheap drugs than have them steal my stuff or attack me 
o that they can the money to purchase drugs at prices that are out of hand.  The key to a drug free society is education and experience, and not intervention. 
<LI>What americans would lose in freedom outweighs the definite value attained from stricter drug laws- similar to "for the children" arguments, the freedom of the government to sector off and legislate into oblivion the  personal rights guaranteed by the constitution scares me beyond description
<LI>Drugs are the scourge of the younger generation today. I blame the Boomers who felt free to try anything and now wonder why they can't control their kids.  My daughter is a freshman at a state university and can't believe how big a part alcohol plays in the lives of her peers.  
<LI>People should be allowed the chance to legally use drugs responsibly.  There is a huge difference between use and abuse, and those that abuse should be the ones penalized, not those using responsibly.  I have smoked marijuana for 15 years and graduated college with a 3.4 GPA, own my home and hold a professional job.  
<LI>I will not use certain drugs (eg. illegal), however I don't mind drinking under age in extreme moderation. My choice not to use illegal drugs is because of their side effects.
<LI>I think it is far too simple for young people to obtain addictive materials.  I first tried tobacco when I was 13 and I have never really been able to kick the habit.  Ostensibly we have laws which prohibit this but they clearly do not work.  I think a combination of greater education for young people and more stringent penalties for those selling legal drugs to minors should exist.  I also think that the substances which are currently illeagle in the US should stay that way and that penalties for user
 and dealers should be significantly more sever if we are to curb the effects these substances are having on our population.
<LI>There is OBVIOUSLY a huge problem with the way the U.S. deals with drug problems... HELLO, it's time for a NEW plan now!!!!!
<LI>People should try to deal with the problem more open, like they have with Alcohol, an efffort should be made to reduce the money that can be made, then something would happen to the drug problem.
<LI>Drugs should be available and if people want to do them then that is there choice. The government should have control over them to get rid of the black market and make money off of it. 
<LI>I think that with a a lot education... people can learn the effects of drug and alcohol usage, and decide for themselves whether or not taking subtances is a good idea for them.
<LI>For adults, the choice is simple with illegal drugs.  You are aware they are illegal, so if you purchase and use them, you take your chances on being arrested, charged and convicted of criminal activities.  Those drugs that are legal and are prescribed by a physician should be used only under the physician's supervision.  
<LI>Many drugs should be legalized, Smelly ones such as marijuana should not be used in public.they all should be highly regulated where and how they can be used.  Penalties for abuser's (not User's) should be severe (to include death) for crimes committed while under thier influence.
<LI>Addicts are addicts and will find a way to their addiction. Why regulate what can't be regulated.
<LI>Whoa, I don't really need them, I'd hate to be dependent on somethin, ya know, I like control, nicotine & pot are cool, alkies kind suq.  Stoners I like hanging with cause I'm a lot like them normally.
<LI>Drug use, if done responsibly is fine.  The danger is when use becomes abuse.  Education, honesty about the effects of drugs, and programs to help individuals should they become dependent, are necessary. Not lies and propaganda.  It's human nature to want to alter our conscious.  Laws will not work!
<LI>The drug war is insane, should be ended
<LI>we need to stop the war on drugs and the violence it creates in our streets.  make it legal, and educate people in its proper use
<LI>I don't think drugs should be legalized only if they are used in Religious Ceremonies, like the Indians used it.  I think that some drugs should be illegal unless, only if they don't have much of an effect. Sincerely , Rachel Reynolds
<LI>prohibiton does not work, the government should not conduct a war against its own people and I don't want to pay taxes for the war. Legalize drugs so they can be distributed without violence and the government can make money on drug taxes instead of wasting money by fighting a war against non violent people. This will reduce our prison population so we can focus on rapist, robbers and murderers!
<LI>Drugs are dumber than the idiots that use them.
<LI>I'd rather be around a group of stoners than a group of drunks.  Therefore, why should alcohol be legal when pot is not.
<LI>I realize that tea/coffee contain "drugs" but find it difficult to include these in substance abuse.  I do not approve of anyone smoking cigarettes due to 2nd hand smoke.  People who abuse any drug should seek treatment before their lives are ruined. 
<LI>If I need drugs and/or alcohol to cope with my life, then I don't see myself as much of a person anyway.  
<LI>Use or non-use of ANY drug is a personal decision each individual must make, given the availability of all drugs. So is the responsibility for the consequences for ones own actions and decisions. I.E. don't blame others for your mistakes, claim "I didn't know", etc. etc.
<LI>Never had them, never will!
<LI>Legalize stuff!
<LI>I think that drug usage is great
<LI>My thoughts and drugs and their use is that any person that uses drugs knows  what they are getting into.  You should be smart enough to think for yourself, and if a person wants to use drugs, as long as they are not hurting any one else I think should be perfectly legal.
<LI>Drugs are unhealthy but citizens have a right to choose to use them or not.
<LI>I think that drug users and dealers should face penalties.
<LI>Teens start taking drugs to escape. Remove the need to get away and you remove the need for drugs.
<LI>i would like to see fewer young adults use the products
<LI>I fucking love drugs and alcohol and everything they stand for.
<LI>Everything is okay in MODERATION. The less harmful drugs such as marijuana i feel should be legalized because the plant can provide us with much more than a good high. The law needs to be more strict against those who deal the crap to the kids.
<LI>All one has to do is read their local paper, and watch the evening news to see what the effect of drugs are on our country.  If drug users and dealers were truly treated like criminals, we'd have less of a problem
<LI>I think that when dealing with Drugs and Alcohol, we need to repeal many of the laws that have messed up society such as the 21 year old drinking age and numerous other blue laws.
<LI>Your questions on the how marijuana, alcohol, cocaine affect persons were poorly constructed. Several of the answers could apply. I found it impossible to choose one answer for question 6.  OVERALL NOTE: Question #5 is a very good one, because it focuses on the root of the legalization problem. A large plurality can agree on something like marijauna, alcohol, cigarettes, which a great many people have some knowledge of. The tough part is deciding the legal fate of the less popular drugs. Very quickly w
 find ourselves passing judgement on a drug we know nothing about. Unless you're a total legalization advocate, you believe some drugs are just plain poisons that should be kept in check. The problem is deciding which ones, and separating your personal prejudices from the decision-making process. That's a large reason why the approach to drug laws is so confused now. People don't know how dangerous these various drugs are or are not, so they sort of fall in line with the thinking: if it's not legal, don't 
ake it legal. It's a politically safe position based on ignorance, but I find it hard to blame people for not having enough knowledge to make an informed decision.
<LI>My thoughts on drugs, well, I think that dope is fine to smoke, but the hard stuff is a waste of space on this earth. The more dealers put out of action the better.
<LI>Users need to be dried up! Dealers would follow shortly.
<LI>DECRIMINALIZATOIN OF ALL DRUGS
<LI>if you need it , your in trouble
<LI>Depends on the drug's type. Generally I think that educational programs on drug and addictive substance should be given by experienced people (ex-toxicos for example) who have some credibility amongst adolescents. Since the major problems with the drugs i
<LI>If it damages you or your family...don't do it.
<LI>Responsible people act responsibly those that are not don't.  The drug is not the issue as much as is the person who chooses to use it or not,  and if they they choose , then how.
<LI>All drugs should be legalized.  Making drugs illegal doesn't stop anyone from doing them.  Good job Clinton.
<LI>It is scary to see how easy it is to get drugs and how many peoples lives are affected. We need better programs for drug users to raise their self esteem and get them back in society and the laws need to be tougher on the big dealers.
<LI>Legalize EVERYTHING.  Allow use in special drug centers where users are supervised until they "come down" from their high.  Tax the hell out of all the new drugs, proportionately higher taxes for more harmful drugs, and pour all the proceeds until law enforcement and drug rehab/detox.
<LI>there are by themselves ok in the hands of hummans they are evil but they must be leagalized becuase they are what funding greater evils,and futhermore....
<LI>I think that there are certain drugs that have extremly devastating effects (heroine, cocaine) and that drugs that are highly addictive should not be legalized.  Hasch and Pot are not highly addictive drugs and have very similar effects to alcohol.  We need to take a close look at who's pumping in heroine and cocaine to kids, they're sick!
<LI>It is a personal choice.
<LI>The War on Drugs is a Joke.  Prohibition has taught us that restricting drug/alcohol use does NOT reduce consumption.  We shouuld forget abotu drugs/alcohol and worry about more serious problems in this country.
<LI>mariguana should be legalized and taxed like smokes, drugs should also be legalized for medical uses.  
<LI>Amphetomines should never be legalized (except caffiene).
<LI>Pot should be legalized, tobacco should be illegal!
<LI>I think one should wait until mature enough to experience and not be jailed for life if drugs are used.
<LI>There is no blanket answer or statement.  All drugs, even caffein, interact differently with different people.  The way to react to it is to look at psychology rather than legislation.
<LI>education is important .
<LI>No minimums - Non hyperactive substances should be legal
<LI>The war on drugs is a sham
<LI>I don't believe in drugs however, I do think that marijuana should be at least de-criminalized if not legalized.  If it is legalized the government will be able to control and monitor the market.  This way the drugs will be prepapred under strit measures which will be safer to the consumers.  
<LI>Fine by me.
<LI>IF YOU ARREST THE USER, WH0 IS THE PUSHER GOING TO SELL   IT  TO?
<LI>drugs are not the problem...parents are the problem.
<LI>Having tried some of the ones that people most want legalized, I must say that I don't see them as being good, and would be very uncomfortable in a society that allows drug use freely.  I'd be scared to drive, worrying that someone legally stoned was on the roads with me.
<LI>kids, beleive me, just say no
<LI>it,s a persons own choice, their life not yours
<LI>The drug war is only effective as an employment vessel for the government.  It destroys lives and livlihoods as well as creates a stigma about drug use that drives many users into a dangerous subculture.  
<LI>The only illegal substance I have had is wine for the Sabath. But I am strongly oposed to all drug taking (eg. Cocaine). Making drugs illegal is pointless. If I realy wanted to take drugs I could. We might as well legalize drugs so the price of them will crash. Therefor ilegal trafficing of drugs would be a none-profit buisness. 
<LI>Used drugs and alcohol from ages 11 to 19. It was very destructive to my youth. It put me behind educational, morally and social for many years. 
<LI>Drugs and Alcohol Suck - Justin McCall - 15
<LI>When I was a kid, we were experimenting with drugs and alcohol at the age of 16 and 17. Now I am an adult, have children of my own, and they are experimenting with this stuff at a much younger age. I don't know what is happening here, but it needs to stop, NOW! We need to educate our children more on the dangers of drugs and alcohol.
<LI>I think that the most exuberating times that I have ever had in my odious life have been when I could escape from the constricting relms of the physical world and free my soul to interact with the planet in a more enriching way through the use of pot/
<LI>Drugs are not that bad unless they over used. Marijuana is one drug that definately should be legalized. I has less effect on my body than alcohol. Alcohol is illegal, since I am a minor. But I am in college and it is more than avaible at any time. 
<LI>Drugs are bad.  Drugs are wrong.  Let's destroy existing bongs.
<LI>Drugs really mess up your head.  Go to College and be something, but remember have fun in College  :)
<LI>The war on drugs is a welfare program!  The whole thing is insane.
<LI>All drugs that are harmful should be banned, including tobacco.
<LI>More education at earlier ages is needed but should NOT be left to regular classroom teachers; it should be a D & A professional giving out the info.
<LI>drugs are ok as long as they do not dominate your life
<LI>Many drugs are bad and can do harm, but nobody should interfere with another persons right to do them as long as nobody else gets hurt.  If they hurt themselves it is their own fault.  Everybody should be educated about the pitfalls of using drugs.
<LI>As long as it is used recreationally and does not pose a health risk to the user, or others by his/her actions I have no problem with recreational drug use.
<LI>I feel that a lot of the usage is by younger people just doing it because it is illegale or wrong. If it were legal I think that would stop some of the usage of those who are just being rebellios.
<LI>I think alcohol is a more dangerous and potent drug than marijuana.  Marijuana should probably be legalized for many reasons include its usefulness in many types of manufacturing and its relatively low effect on the senses.
<LI>I could not survive as a responsible employee and mother without them.
<LI>Done in the privacy of your own home and it dosen't harm anyboby (this does not include doing drugs in the presence of your kids) is ok and none of anybodys business
<LI>IT HAS RUN AMUCK.
<LI>I think the President is a crack baby
<LI>I think people should look at the actual facts, rather than the socially accepted facts on drugs.  Drugs such as marajuana have been catagorized as evil by the government and the media, but after looking at the stats and the facts people would see the truth.  By studying drugs and learning all of the actual facts, people will be able to make more of an educated decision about drug use and not just go off of what the government tells them.  I find it odd that there are more smokers now-a-days than non-s
okers, and it is still illegal.  LEGALIZE MARAJUANA!!!
<LI>CERTAIN DRUGS MUST BE TOTALLY WIPED OUT, NO ACCESS TO USERS.  CERTAIN DRUGS SHOULD BE LEGALIZED IF GIVEN AS PRESCRIPTION BY MD'S.
<LI>Like anything, making a law to solve a problem is silly.  I tend to agree that education is the key to problems, but I have little sympathy for fools who want to kill themselves _and_ take me with them!
<LI>Certain drugs should remain illegal, however, marijuana should be legal and drinking ages should be lowered
<LI>Both drugs and alcohol are bad if not consumed responsibly.  However it is the responsibility of individuals and parents to teach children responsibility twards such substances.  The only thing government should do is enforce extreamly strict laws for people who aren't responsible users.
<LI>The parents should be looking for their children to not take drugs
<LI>By legalising many currently banned drugs their use could be made safer, as many of the ill effects of illict drugs are the result of poor quality drugs or drugs mixed with other harmful substances. If drugs could be tested to find their content before people took them their use would be much safer 
<LI>I think the harder drugs are gaining popularity among young people. Maryjuana use has definately gone up, but if used in moderation it is okay.
<LI>Numerous clinical studies show that marijuana is significantly less dangerous than alcohol, yet it is still demonized.  The information that is currently being distributed on drugs is biased by the legal issues rather than the real clinical issues and how to deal with drugs responsibly.
<LI>Most everyone will experiment, but that does'nt mean it's alright, there is a price to pay sooner or later....  
<LI>Drug testing and demanding drug free employees should be an employers prerrogative but it should not, under any circumstances, be done by the government.  The same applies to any control or regulation of intoxicating, harmfull substances.  Each adult individual should have the right to go to Hades in whichever way better suits him or her.  As for kids, they are their parents' responsibilities not the federales.  Any parent who needs the government to help him/her raise his/her kids is a de-facto incomp
tent and negligent parent.
<LI>weed, alcohol, tobacco, peyote, or anything natural should be lagal
<LI>At each individuals discretion.
<LI>we seem to have learned nothing from the consequences of prohibition. no we have a government/criminal/foreign country cartel controling drug availability. certainly marijuana should be available for medical purposes (in pill form) and if alcohol and tobacco are legal i guess all forms of marijuana should be. people can legaly make beer and wine, let them grow their own pot under similar restrictions. 
<LI>The answer to stopping drug use isn't in criminalizing its use, but rather, educating the users.  Get them out of the jails, and into the schools.  A drug user doesn't learn to stop by being put in jail.  More often, those incarcerated are exposed to stronger drugs, and pick up their more dangerous drug habits from within the penal system.
<LI>I like to drink beer and chew tobacco but smoking makes me sick.  I've had many chances to smoke marijuana but I never have because its not cool!!!
<LI>This issue has really been taken advantage because now a lot of "people" are being able to get a hold of it, extremely fast.
<LI>people will fight their own demons the "best" way they see fit at a particular time. if the person who is getting high or drunk doesn't have someone there that really cares about him/her, they will most likely self-destruct (like kurt cobain did). there has to be someone there that genuinely cares for someone to give it up for good. been there, done that, don't want to go back.
<LI>As an asthmatic I have had to take drugs all of my life. The side effects of most drugs negate much of perceived value. Recreational drugs are dangerous, and society must find answers to the wide distribution of them. The problem has become so politicized that no solution is remotely possible.
<LI>I think that alcohol is regulated well, but I feel that hard drugs are unnecessary and should not be around.
<LI>I think drugs are a good thing unless they are used unappropriatly or in hazordous situations.
<LI>I think the problems we have with drug abuse in our society is very  sad.  People need to stay away from illegal drugs and use legal drugs in moderation.
<LI>I think there should be stricter laws against all who use, sell, or produce drugs.
<LI>drugs help me get through anything life throws at me. And they are a lot of fun!!!!!!!
<LI>If it's organic don't panic
<LI>We (AMERICA) are wasting way too much time, money, and invaluable resource fighting drugs.. 
<LI>There is a time and place for everything
<LI>Drug dealers and users deserve harsh punishment
<LI>All drugs should be legal, but should be regulated by the government and the health profession.  The use of recreational drugs in and of itself does not cause problems in our society.  The problems stem from society's attitudes about drug use and the resu
<LI>I think drug and alcohol use should be highly discouraged but also decriminalized for the user.
<LI>Vote for Harry Browne for president. End the fedral income tax, end the failing "War On Drugs".
<LI>Dope gets you through times with no money better than money gets you through times with no dope.
<LI>drugs are a personal decision for everyone. The goverment should stop trying to regulate it and let people make their own decisions. The government should educate the population and let them make the decision.
<LI>u dont have enough space or do u ? : all drugs r a problem, wether mull or powder , the idiots that push this shit need to be dealt with .DEATH , in certian cases powder and shit could be approriate, see i think mull (marijuana) screws up the brain , i use to smoke very large amounts , ie 3 of us smoke 1 once in 34 hours fun but at least i snaped out of it , dont know why or how but the people i grew up with wernt so lucky some r brain dead, the others are just dead(hanging , mostly) i put that down to
paranoyia, see i cant spell but thats probly the teacher fault , if u have cookied me ask me more but pthewr wise dont fucking let kids get screwed up with all this freedom shit Andrew Park
<LI>drugs can be fun but they do fuck with your mind
<LI>should be used as necessary for medicinal reasons
<LI>i dont like drugs i thaink anyone thats uses it should be shot.
<LI>Legalize Marijuana
<LI>I think things like cocaine is bad because it really can kill, but marijuana to me is fine as long as you don't sell to kids!!
<LI>I feel the Higher Goverment (cia & covert) are allowing drugs to come into the states for their professional gains.
<LI>Education and access to recreation are key to controlling drugs and alcohol, remove the desire
<LI>People should be held responsible for their actions should they use drugs and alcohol. Stop blaming society and their past for their actions of today.  Those that don't should be penalized either financially of professionally.
<LI>If someone wants to take drugs, they should be prepared to accept the consequences of their actions.  There is so much factual information floating around about the hazardous effects of drugs, only an imbecile would start or continue using drugs.
<LI>Drugs are wrong. There should be more stringent policies against drug users and dealers.
<LI>Some people will always experiment with alcohol/drugs.Education on changing peoples attitude about their usage needs to change.An alert mind and healthy body should be encouraged and mind altering and unhealthy life styles stressed as poor choices and not the accepted "thing to do."
<LI>"Just Don't Do It"
<LI>Legalizing drugs removes the money from the equation, no money means less crime, less crime means a better society with more funds for drug education and treatment.  People and governments should mind their own business.
<LI>Just as guns don't kill, people with guns kill; drugs don't kill people that ABUSE drugs kill---taken in responsible strides, drugs can be very enjoyable---people who abuse them give drugs a bad name and help to create the image that ALL PEOPLE AND ALL DR
<LI>I think that drugs have the ability to create some major problems, I got lucky and it didn't for me, I still smoke, and drink occasionally, but I no longer use any drugs, just as a personal choice.  That's what I believe the main thing is, is that the rig
<LI>I think that all the interest in drug use is strictly political.  I don't believe politicians really care about those who truly have a problem with drugs.  I also believe that marijuana should be legal as it doesn't cause people who use it to commit crimes to get it.  You've never seen ANY crimes commited by people who use this drug.  It's been around for a long time and for some one like myself, it's used for medicinal  reasons.   I think this entire war on drugs is a complete waste of time.  Especial
y when they lock up the users not the sellers, and I don't mean small time local dealers.  I think the laws for hardcore drugs like heroin, crack, etc should remain the same.  Go after the big drug cartels (except the growers of pot) and not lock up some kid or adult who just wants to ease his or her pain.
<LI>Shouldn't be illegal. It creates more problems.
<LI>Drug distribution seems to be one of the root causes of drug-related violence.  Legalization of marijuana, et al presents its own problems, but I think that drug-related violence would subside as a result.  Naturally, we would need to concentrate thereafter on rehab for the addicted.
<LI>All people should have a freedom of choice.  That you choose to use a self destructive drug is your choice and your responsibility.  As long as a person inflicts harm solely upon himself it is his sole business.
<LI>Drugs and drug usage is a problem in the US society in that as a "new" nation in comparison to the Old World, "we" use it as a way of dealing with society and personal problems.  Education is needed to stress other ways of social enjoyment as well as social/conflict resolution.
<LI>dependence on anything that destroys your mind and body is a form of low self esteem and one should seek to get help from someone.  everyone has problems, but it takes a strong person to not let the problems control them but they control the problems. it takes courage to overcome drugs and drugs usages.  the first thing you have to do is admitt you have a problem. 
<LI>I believe that all individuals should be allowed to exercise the right to do what they wish with their own body so long as they harm no other person. Government should have no jurisdiction over the method an individual uses to alter their consciousness.
<LI>If it doesn't hurt anyone, legalize it.
<LI>Self control
<LI>It is very cool at the time, but than reality hits and it hits hard!
<LI>Some drugs used on an occasional basis are o.k., but heavy drugs that put you at a great risk of an overdose or make you loose your ability to process thoughts should be done away with.
<LI>Its a complex issue with the question comes to my mind, when and what drug may be used for recreation in a safe manor and how much as to not become dependant on it? Drugs have been around as long as mankind, there must be a need by the human body to want relief from pressure and stress.
<LI>Government has no "Constitutional" right to control or legislate drug useage.
<LI>Balance is everything.  I tried a few things, but they all seem like escape; life is too fascinating to get overinvolved in drugs and escape it.
<LI>Some drugs can really help you cope with stress, but others are just pointless, brain-damaging, stupidifying substances that should've been wiped off the face of the earth centuries ago.
<LI>Drugs of any type should be legalized.  Get out of the drug war which can't be won, and devote resources to education and real crime.
<LI>If the world didn't have drugs shit would be seriously fucked up. Teenagers rely on drugs to help them out day to day. I know I wouldnt be able to cope without drugs in my life!Legalize pot people!"Whats everybody waiting for a miracle lets get to it.
<LI>i lik dem 
<LI>WHY IS ALCOHOL, WITH ALL THE DOCUMENTED DAMAGE IT CAUSES, SO WONDERFUL AND YET MARIJUANA IS SO DAMAGING TO THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE. PEOPLE ACT LIKE CONPLETE SOB`s WHEN THEY DRINK. I`M I MISSING SOMETHING??? ....SOME POLITICAL MAYBE???
<LI>realizing that drugs are very addictive I was not capable of judging true reality until I allowed God to rule over my life.  Peopl should strive to find other means for relief.  The Bible is my only defense for the addictive behaviors.
<LI>I look back now on the drugs and alcohol I used when I was a teenager and think how stupid I was.  I wasted a lot of time drunk or stoned when I could have been doing something worthwhile with my life.  At this point in my life I believe all illegal drugs should stay illegal and alcohol and nicotine should become illegal.
<LI>Drugs are to be administered only under strict medical and Psychological requirements
<LI>Alcohol and drugs are used in a social setting.  Unfortunatly,  many people take it too far and become to involved in their use of those products.  For that reason, drugs should not be legalized except for the accepted drugs like alcohol, but people must be educated about the effects of use.
<LI>Real problem for society. I sincerely believe drugs could be the downfall of the US
<LI>Marijuana never makes anyone do commit crimes or unthought things.
<LI>Hard drugs are a very real problems for society.
<LI>None
<LI>Just Say No Falied!
<LI>Abuse(including social use) are a severe detriment to our society
<LI>I'm for free information, free alcohol & drugs, free religion. Its your life. Make of it what YOU want, as long as you are not a burden for other people.
<LI>I think that certain drugs used with caution and moderate amounts (such as perscription) should be legalized.
<LI>I think everyone has used it at least once in their day, even the President of the United States, I think it is how you deal with it as to what affects it will have on you.
<LI>Where drugs impair mentally, I'm against them, but the government should not be involved.
<LI>Drugs are the stupidest thing a person can do to themselves, it's basically committing suicide.
<LI>The drug issue is central to escalating government intrusion in our lives.
<LI>it's o.k. if your always in control
<LI>If used correctly drugs can be good for your mind
<LI>We will never eradicate drug/alcohol use, so we must educate people on the dangers of both.  I don't think its anyone's business if an adult chooses to mess around with drugs/alcohol as long as they do are not endagering anyone else or influencing underage use.  No drinking/drugging & driving!  Stay home, stay safe.
<LI>drug dealers should all be heavily penalized not just crack dealers
<LI>I've tried both drugs and alcohol and feel that both are relaxing, however,  i was fortunate nenough not to have a problem  and decide to quit before i did  and eurge  everyone else to do the same
<LI>Marijuana should be legal, and taken in only in moderation
<LI>I frankly do not give a shit what people choose to put in their body as long as they are responsible in not letting it control their lives.
<LI>Drug usage is a major tool of satan.  Drug addiction is underestimated problem in this country.  Bill Clinton uses drugs on a regular basis.  
<LI>Drugs are very destructive in every way.Why do them/
<LI>people are going to do what they want, why persecute them for living their own way?  We're all on this planet for our own purposes...end the tyrrany
<LI>Drugs Suck
<LI>Alcoholism and drug abuse is a sickness that is slowly killing this country.
<LI>I think it is too easy to say drugs should be legalised. It affects people in different ways. I thinnk that tobacco and alchohol are just as dangerous and addictive as cocaine and herion. Education , not legislation, will sufficently make people aware of what they are goiung in to, as well as decent job prospects and a future for the young who are hooked in a BAD way.
<LI>Most should be legalized, and we could deal with abuse through education
<LI>Drugs are ruining today's teens, who will be running this country in the future!
<LI>Everyone is free to use them
<LI>If a person can handle whatever drugs they want to take and they aren't hurting anyone else, fine by me.  Unfortunately most people can't handle most drugs responsibly so some regulation and education is clearly needed.
<LI>Drugs and alcohol are usually the main cause of crime, spousal abuse, child abuse, murder, rape and so on.  You can probably link many or all crimes to drugs or alcohol use.
<LI>PARENTS ARE THE ANSWER TO THE DRUG PROBLEM.  THEY NEED
<LI>Marijuana is harmless; therefore needs to be legalized immediately.  I'm not a criminal, I just smoke the chronic..
<LI>Teach our childeren to stop using drugs 
<LI>Drug use should not be a criminal offense; more research needs to be done regarding illegal drug use as self-medicating for psychological disorders.
<LI>I have considered strongly the possibility of legalizing all drugs to take away
<LI>I have had a lot of experiences with most of the drugs in your survey.  I wish that part of my life never happened. I am so far behind in life compared to my friends that didnt take that road.  I wouldnt wish the drug and alcohol life on my worst enemy!
<LI>Education is important. Not "This is bad, period, no explanation." or a categorical "evil, evil, evil". Education should educate. (really) What is the physiology of any given substance? Legalize, educate, and let individuals make choices. It's true, we do
<LI>Drug usage is a personal issue. The government cannot erradicate drugs from our society, they should consider new methods of dealing with drugs and their users.
<LI>Should be banned at all , drug dealer to be killed 
<LI>Dealers are only giving consumers what they want. Adults should be able to purchase any substance (especially plants) for their own use. I would like to see all drugs either freely available or regulated similar to alcohol and tobacco.
<LI>a very complicated matter.
<LI>I think that illegal drugs are illegal for a reason, they harm the user because they can be targeted as deadly.
<LI>i think the ones that are illegal should stay illegal
<LI>Marajuana is easily accepted by the younger generation X.  It is almost considered like going out for a drink - I do not think of it as right though.  The problem is that people do it when there is nothing else to do.  They do drugs because of bordom. 
<LI>Let the people be personally responsible for their own actions
<LI>Beer is beer, drugs are drugs.......you just got to deal with them..
<LI>Everything in moderation
<LI>The fucking goverment currently is so worried about people obtaining and using drugs, the hell with these people if they want to ruin their lives hand out the poison.     
<LI>Though I think all drugs should be legal I do not think that all drugs should be available.  I am against the concept of the government determining what people may or may not comsume.  I think that some drugs such as LSD have the potential for opening doors of perception which may not be as easily accessible under other conditions.  For many people these doors of perception open up to worlds of discovery and personal insight.  I think that drugs such as LSD should be legal and readily accessible.  Unli
e many other drugs, drugs such as LSD do not generally have a tendency to amplify feelings of aggression and hostility which are frequently translated into acts of violence and destruction.
<LI>I've seen many family members' lives destroyed by drugs and alcohol.  I believe the US should use its resources (armed forces, etc.) to find the ones who bring drugs into this country & bring big punishment upon the LARGE dezlers instaed of the corner dealers.
<LI>In moderation, both are fine.  If too much disposible income is being directed towards their usage, they become problematic.
<LI>Rather than spending billions of $ on fighting a ridiculous drug war, we should open the question to the free market to economically decide. In a truly capitalist society, the free market, with minimal societal (note I didn't say governmental) controls will lead to the ultimate rational conclusions.
<LI>Drugs are great if someone can regulate the amount and how often they do CERTAIN drug, such as lsd.
<LI>I THINK THEY'RE ONLY HARMING THEMSELVES & THAT'S PRETTY STUPID ON THIER PART!  BUT IF THEY WANT TO, THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT!
<LI>doing drugs can lead to so many happy places!  if everyone smoked pot, or sniffed blow there wouln't be as many assholes on this earth!!
<LI>I favor the use of drugs for medical and health purposes and support     some control and regulation.       This would help stemm he flow of illigal drugs in the inner cities and minority communities which are  responsible for much of the crime experienced in those sectors of most of our major cities and suburbs.
<LI>If you could guarantee that drug use wouldn't affect anyone but the user, that would be one thing, but, people smoking marajuana near me, force ME to breath it and people who take drugs and try to drive or do their jobs, force the results of that use on ME. That's not right, especially when you're talking about driving, flying, doctors, judgement. Not to mention the fact that the most popular drugs are far more addictive than alcohol to most. THAT locks you into a need that others can manipulate. That 
eans you no longer have a free choice to make decisions. To have a lawmaker, a judge, a doctor, a person of responsibility manipulated by someone else ( and that's not to say there aren't OTHER ways people are manipulated, too), it isn't right.
<LI>they don't appeal to me.  no one in my family uses them, except nicotine,and we're going to sue over that.  when i did whatever for the last time, that was it. i never looked back.  nicotine, however, has been impossible to kick.  and, i started when the tobacco companies were trlling people that it was good for them.  and, they knew better.
<LI>I don't use drugs but I don't have anything against those that do, unless they interfere with my life. It's hypocritical to have alcohol and tobacco legal but not marijuana. I say legalize all the drugs (or most of them) but confine the users to a designa
<LI>The encient indians used to use different kinds of drugs to connect with their gods,now we use druggs as an escape from reality .I think that if there was a system(educational) that can give the chance to young people to try druggs in controled amaunt it 
<LI>I feel it is a personal decision and I can't give up control of my mind and body.  I feel that most people take drugs as a result of social effects, wether it is pear pressure or to escape problems that they have encoutered in their lives.  Once they obtain some control in their lives then they can live a drug/alchole free life!!!!
<LI>DRUGS ARE HARMFUL TO SOCIETY AND PEOPLE ARE NOT ONLY HURTING THEMSELVES WHEN THEY USE DRUGS BUT THEY ARE HURTING HUMANITY
<LI>Too much use in our society.Causes moral and social decay
<LI>I have no real problem with making a few illigal drugs legal if they can serve a medical purpose such as hemp. I also think that just being harder on dealers of illigal substances won't do the trick, we must be firm with users also.
<LI>It is up to PARENTS to tell their children about the dangers of using alcohol, tobacco and drugs to excess. Certain drugs, such as morphine, are used by hospitals to alleviate pain after surgery, but should NOT be used by individuals at home without medic
<LI>drugs are fuckin rad
<LI>There is something wrong with a person if they need artificial means to entertain (or escape) themself.  It is also partly the fault of that person's family.
<LI>We can not solve these problems with laws. We first need to work on fixing ourselves. Our main goal in life in the USA is material we are chasing after worldly tinsels then pay interest(usery)to aquire them then worry about losing them and purchase insurance for them. Think about it! Why not trust Him Who has created us and follow His laws? Makes sense does it not the only book of God that has not been changed is the Holy Quran for more information check out the truth about Islam at www.daar-ul-ehsaan.
rg 
<LI>YOu can't blame anyone except the user for the drug problem in this country. I sometimes think that drugs or at least some drugs should be legalized and then heavily regulized to get the drugs away from the mobs and the gangs. That's probably wishful thin
<LI>Question 16 is bogus, since the attitudes it lists are not mutually exclusive, yet we get only one choice.  Drugs should be freely available because criminalization is not the answer, education is.  Recreational drug use is basically stupid, but people have a right to be stupid with their own bodies and minds if they want.
<LI>Drugs are a personal thing.  You may start for a wide range of reasons, but exterior force can make one stop.
<LI>Drugs suck
<LI>There is entirely too much emphasis and monies placed on the "Drug War" which in turn becomes an expensive and time consuming burden on the legal and penal system.  These systems should be used for the dispensation of justice for violent crimes.
<LI>Drug, alcohol and tobacco use amoung kids is out of control.  At my school, many people smoke, and brag about how many times they've been drunk.  These are eigth-graders.  As kids get off the bus, you'll see them light a cigarette.  I've never smoked or taken any drugs except for medication and the only time I've consumed alcohol is a glass of wine at Christmas.  However, several kids in my class cannot say as much.

 <H1><P ALIGN=CENTER>Of Altered States and Liberal Realities</H1>



<H4>

<DD><H3><CENTER>By Dale R. Trott<BR>
</CENTER></H3>

<P>
Over the years, I've heard many a conservative-minded talk show
host or columnist opine over the alternate reality that liberals
surely must reside within. That's a pretty bold claim even when
one considers the source of this theory.<BR>

<P>
To suggest that such a large percentage of the population is living
in an alternate reality sounds absurd, and even though I hold
a number of conservative ideals near and dear to my heart, it
was hard for me to imagine that anyone could be<I> that</I> out
of touch with reality. Now I'm not so sure.<BR>

<P>
In a recent interview with Ms. Magazine, Liberal Democrat Patricia Schroeder, Congresswoman from Colorado, stated the following with regard to the current state of talk radio in America:<BR>

<P>
"Now you can firehose people with your ideology 24 hours a day and never let the other side on. Listen to the <I>Rush Limbaugh Show</I> -- they don't air callers who disagree with him. It's made to sound like all America agrees with this idiot. Those of us who would like to answer can't because now there's no FCC requirement for balance."
<BR>

<P>
After hearing Schroeder whine about the lack of  balance on talk radio, it would be hard to argue with those who claim Schroeder and liberals like her are indeed living in some little-understood altered state of reality or perhaps even another planet in some distant solar system!
<BR>

<P>
I don't know if Ms. Schroeder expects Limbaugh to begin offering an "equal time" segment for liberal rebuttal in response to her dissatisfaction, but if that is the case, she most certainly <I>is</I> living in an altered state of reality. At times I must wonder if the entire city of Washington, D.C. exists in some unexplained state of altered reality, but I'll leave that subject for a future column.
<BR>

<P>
Beyond the absurdity of her presumed expectation of a rebuttal segment on the<I> Rush Limbaugh Show</I>, it is even more absurd for her to rail against the imbalance she perceives in conservative radio talk shows. Apparently Rep. Schroeder has conveniently forgotten that liberals practically own the big media outlets and the entire entertainment industry to boot.
<BR>

<P>Liberals have long denied the bias that is so obvious in the mainstream media today, but the once impenetrable fortress of denial they have protected themselves within is slowly crumbling around them. In a February 13 column in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, veteran CBS News correspondent Bernard Goldberg penned the following:
<BR>

<P>
"The old argument
that the networks and other 'media elites' have a liberal bias
is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore.
No, we don't sit around in dark corners and plan strategies on
how we're going to slant the news. We don't have to. It comes
naturally to most reporters."<BR>

<P>
More recently, a poll of journalists released on April 17 by the
Freedom Forum should help us understand why the mainstream media
has a decidedly liberal agenda. Out of 139 journalists polled,
89 percent of them voted for Bill Clinton compared to four percent
that voted for George Bush. Two percent of them claimed to be
conservative and four percent of them said they were registered
Republicans. Fifty percent are registered Democrats, and 37 percent
are independents. Ninety-one percent describe themselves as liberal
or moderate.<BR>

<P>
This certainly comes as no surprise to those of us who have witnessed the development of the mainstream media over the past decade or so. One does not have to observe very long before their efforts to further the liberal agenda become obvious.
<BR>

<P>
From welfare to gun control, the "news" is skillfully slanted in a direction that must surely bring joy to the hearts of Bill Clinton, Patricia Schroeder and countless other liberals who probably look forward to the news every evening for a little lift. Especially if they have had a particularly difficult day dealing with those hateful conservatives up on the hill.
<BR>

<P>
Not to be outdone by the news media, the entertainment industry boasts its very own collection of slick liberal spin doctors. I'm sure this issue is also hotly contested by many liberals, but once again, one does not have to invest a great deal of time looking for the evidence of this bias. As a matter-of-fact, one does not have to be looking for it at all!
<BR>

<P>
As a rule, I do my best to avoid the seemingly endless supply of star-studded awards programs that seem to appear weekly on television these days. However, since my wife does watch them occasionally, I am sometimes exposed to these programs anyway. Call it "guilt by association" if you like. Most recently it was the Academy Awards that captured my attention as I entered our living room to discuss something with my wife.
<BR>

<P>
Had I not been aware of the program's title beforehand, I could have easily mistaken it for a Republican roast! I happened to walk in just in time to see Whoopi Goldberg and Robin Williams poke fun at the Republican presidential candidates. I'll admit to watching only a small portion of the program, but I would find it hard to believe that this particular portion was not representative of the political humor that delighted the assembled dignitaries throughout the entire production.
<BR>

<P>
I found it interesting -- but not surprising -- that Goldberg and Williams had nothing to say about President Clinton or his wife Hillary, despite the abundant supply of material that should have been available at the time. After all, with recent news regarding Whitewater and mysterious reappearing legal documents in the White House, it would seem that the Clintons would have presented a tempting target for Hollywood's political jokemeisters.
<BR>

<P>
Perhaps Whoopi and Robin subscribe to the time-honored adage that has been preached by countless grandmothers down through the years that suggests the following: "If you cannot say something good about someone, don't say anything at all." In this case, it is apparent that this courtesy applies only to fellow liberals.
<BR>

<P>
Don't think for a minute that the liberals in the entertainment industry reserve their wit and wisdom for adult audiences only. As we all now know, it truly "takes a village" and I don't think it is unreasonable to conclude that the entertainment industry is a very influential resident of our cyber-connected virtual village. This is evidenced by the number of hours many of today's kids spend parked in front of television programming, video games and computer games each and every day of the week.
<BR>

<P>
Not long ago, I joined my children in our living room as they watched a children's cartoon on a well-known children's cable television channel. This is the stuff that's touted as the kind of "quality" children's programming that is supposed to benefit the development of our young people.
<P>
Imagine my surprise when one of the characters on this particular cartoon made an unkind remark about Rush Limbaugh's weight!
<BR>

<P>
And to think that our president and his liberal pals had the nerve to get up in front of the television cameras and condemn conservative talk radio programs as "hate radio". If the<I> Rush Limbaugh Show</I> deserves to be labeled as "hate radio", I wonder how we might describe a children's cartoon that includes insensitive remarks about someone's weight. What kind of message will kids take away from a program like that? Might it suggest to them that it is okay to make fun of the gravitationally challenged?
<BR>

<P>
Apparently, the liberals reserve their politically incorrect and insensitive remarks for use only when discussing conservatives or any other "hateful" group or individual that does not happen to agree with their idealistic view of the universe. Perhaps this type of "hate speech" is only genuinely insensitive and hateful when it is used to describe a liberal.
<BR>

<P>
The good news is that more people than ever before are able to see through the flimsy veil of objectivity that the mainstream press carefully wraps around their daily output. After decades of a virtual monopoly on the dissemination of information, talk radio and the Internet are finally presenting the media giants with some formidable competition.
<BR>

<P>
It's safe money to bet that the news media, entertainment industry and political creatures from both sides of the aisle will be putting more and more pressure on the free exchange of information. We have already seen the modest beginnings of their attempt to control the Internet with the recent passage of the telecommunications bill.
<BR>

<P>
They now realize that a well-informed and well-connected electorate could constitute a genuine threat to status quo, and they will surely act to minimize that threat as quickly as possible. If we allow them to regulate this free exchange of information out of existence, we just may be giving up the best chance we have to put the power of this wayward government back in the hands of the people where it was truly intended to remain from the very beginning.
<BR>

<P> <P>

 <H1><P ALIGN=CENTER>Welfare Reform? Get Real!</H1>


<H2><P ALIGN=CENTER>by Steven R. Van Hook</H2>

<H4>

<DD>The collective cry to cut welfare subsidies for the poor is banging loudly
 on our eardrums.  Taxpayers are concerned, and rightly so, about the 
money we have taken from us each April 15 and handed over to someone else.  
<p>
There are big political points to be gained by righteously and raucously 
calling for cuts in government spending and slashing taxes.  Of course,  
poor people are the most obvious recipients of the government dole -- we 
stand behind them in grocery store lines while they count out their food 
stamps.  
<p>
But the poor are not the only ones with hands out for handouts; there are 
many other government subsidies that could and should be cut.  The military,
 well-off seniors, agriculture, the medical profession, industry -- many 
benefit from government largesse.
<p>
Big business is a big beneficiary of government pay-outs.  The government 
could save $265 billion over five years by eliminating or scaling back 120
 spending programs and tax breaks that benefit particular industries, 
according to one moderate think tank.  
<p>
Even the conservative Cato Institute says we would be hard pressed to 
find a single Fortune 500 company that doesn't receive some sort of 
federal aid.  Will we see such political posturing calling for cuts to 
big business?  Unlikely. <P>

<DD>Problem with cutting subsidies is how loud an ox bellows when he's been 
gored. Interest groups and industries benefiting from government handouts 
organize powerful lobbies to protect their booty. The poor typically haven't
 a very loud voice for protest.
<p>
Granted we would all -- especially the poor -- benefit from better 
alternatives to welfare, but let's look a moment at economic realities.  
<p>
The schism between the rich and the poor in America is growing wider and 
wider. In spite of an improving economy, the Census Bureau reports the 
number of Americans living under the poverty line in 1994 increased to 
15 percent of the nation's population (some 39 million American men, women
 and children).
<p> 
In an ideal society, everyone would be given the opportunity and the 
responsibility to work. But our post-industrial society simply cannot 
afford all the labor available. Indeed, a built-in unemployment rate is 
critical to a sound economy.  
<p>
Without a "natural rate" of Americans unemployed, the economy will 
"overheat" with prices and wages rising, and a generalized inflation set 
into motion. Various experts estimate this natural rate somewhere between 6
 and 7 percent, which, not surprisingly, is about where the current 
national unemployment rate resides.
<p>
Where will the welfare rejects go, if our economy is not designed to 
employ them?  Will we tacitly allow them to fester in frustration?  We 
simply cannot cut off assistance without providing opportunities, or we'll
 see explosive results.  
<p>
As demonstrated in Los Angeles after the Rodney King verdict, these 
frustrations can violently unleash themselves, and we quickly realize the 
powerless are not so powerless after all.   <P>

<DD>We can sidestep the needs of those unable to find work; we can contemplate
 the anecdotal evidence of those unwilling to work.  But we dare not fool 
ourselves into thinking there is not a price to be paid for ignoring their 
plight.  
<p>
Prisons are expensive, police are expensive, unleashed frustration is 
expensive.  One way or another, we as a society will pay for meeting the 
needs of our neighbors.  
<p>
We need to find creative alternatives based on economic and social 
realities.  We have to look beyond political expediency and demagoguery.  
We have to take count of the true costs and benefits of our reforms.  
We need to be wary of the temptation to find easy scapegoats. 
We have to have heart.
<p>
And we can't be blind to who may be powerless, and who, ultimately, is not. <P>

automates the daily back-office operations of a mutual fund or
collective fund by providing the means to collect, calculate and
distribute large volumes of data in a short, but critical, period
of time. FundStation extracts end-of-day prices (NAVs) and dividend
amounts from mutual fund accounting systems; calculates yields,
total rates of return and other statistics; then distributes reports
and data to all interested parties via file, fax, e-mail, hardcopy
or direct transmission. Clients get results that are customized
to their clients, and everyone gets the results faster, with fewer
errors, and with increased control over the process.

This replaces the customer's daily frenzy to manually enter NAVs

<TITLE>FundStation Overview</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<H1><IMG SRC="graphics/cti-fundstation.jpg" ALT="FundStation"> </H1>

<P>
Most outsiders probably think that the fund accountant's work
is done once the funds' NAVs or unit values are cut each afternoon.
In fact, if you manage the fund accounting team, you know that
some of the most critical work still remains to be done: getting
the correct information to the people and systems that need it.
<P>
FundStation was built for this purpose. FundStation collects,
calculates and distributes all the information to all the places
it needs to go. This information includes NAVs, yields, expense
ratios, and total rates of return and FundStation distributes
it regardless of whether that information needs to arrive on paper,
fax, e-mail or in a data file.
<H2><A HREF="detail-addedvalue.htm" >Benefits </A></H2>

<P>
Consider some of the benefits you can realize with FundStation:
<UL>
<LI>Elimination of repeated manual data entry to multiple systems
<LI>Elimination of data entry errors
<LI>Increased control over end-of-day processing; reduced stress
<LI>Quicker delivery of information to clients
<LI>Customized delivery of information to clients
<LI>Quicker delivery of pricing data to other systems (shareholder
recordkeeping, et al)
<LI>Accurate and timely calculations of yields and total rates
of return
<LI>Automated preparation and delivery of reports/data to third-party
agencies
<LI>Ability to process increased volumes without increasing staff

</UL>

<H2>Process Overview </H2>

<P>
FundStation achieves these benefits by automating many of the
processes currently performed manually by the fund accounting
or transfer agency teams. FundStation performs the following tasks:
<UL>
<LI>Extract pricing data from the fund accounting system(s)
<LI>Calculate yields for the previous one, seven and thirty days
<LI>Calculate total rates of return for a large range of time
periods
<LI>Transfer NAVs and income amounts to the shareholder recordkeeping
system(s)
<LI>Transfer NAVs and distribution amounts to other systems (trust,
defined contribution, voice response units)
<LI>Distribute fund pricing data daily via the Daily Fund Profile
(DFP) to external clients via FAX, E-mail, hardcopy or direct
file transmission 
<LI>Provide a repository of descriptive and historical pricing
data to facilitate regulatory and third-party reporting (Lipper,
Morningstar, ICI, NASDAQ) 
</UL>

<H2>Diagram </H2>

<P>
The following illustration represents some of the many ways that
FundStation can improve your operations. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="graphics\fs-overview.jpg" ALT="FundStation Overview" BORDER="1">

<P>
Extract mutual fund NAVs and rates from the fund accounting system.
No changes are required to the existing fund accounting system.
<H3>Data Feeds to Other Systems </H3>

<P>
Transfer data from the fund accounting system into other applications,
including shareholder recordkeeping, trust accounting, participant
recordkeeping or voice response systems. This can often be done
without changes to existing systems. FundStation will also transfer
data to PC applications like spreadsheets and databases in a variety
of formats.
<H3><A HREF="detail-AvailableYields.htm" >Yield Calculations </A>
</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Calculate 1, 7, and 30 day yields, plus 1 month and 1 year
yields. 
<LI>Yields include simple and effective yields.
<LI>Yields can include or exclude capital gains.
<LI>Yields can include or exclude the fund's load. 
</UL>

<H3><A HREF="detail-AvailableReturns.htm" >Total Rates of Return Calculations </A>
</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Calculate total rates of return from 1 month through 10 years
and since inception of the fund. 
<LI>RORs can include or exclude the fund's load, whether front
or back-end loads.
<LI>Month-to-date, year-to-date and fiscal year-to-date RORs are
also available.
<LI>RORs can be calculated daily or at month end. 
</UL>

<H3>Customized Presentation </H3>

<P>
Use a different presentation format of the Daily Fund Profile
for each fund and each fund group. Users control the design and
layout of the report template, including any desired calculations
or graphics.
<H3>Automated Distribution </H3>

<P>
Specify different distributions to each client:
<UL>
<LI>the funds on which to report, 
<LI>the type of delivery (print, FAX, file, e-mail, special transmission),

<LI>the format of the data (which data and in what layout)
<LI>when to distribute the data (as soon as each fund's data is
received from fund accounting, as soon as all data for all of
a recipient's funds are available, at a specified time of day,
or only upon manual initiation). 
</UL>

<H3>Nasdaq Interface </H3>

<P>
FundStation will automatically submit NAVs and Money Market yields
to the NASDAQ system. This feature will be available in the Second
Quarter of 1995.
<H3>Third Party Reporting </H3>

<P>
FundStation provides the data and the reporting mechanisms to
automate the constant flow of information required by third-party
agencies. Information can be provided daily, weekly, monthly or
on other frequencies.
<H3>User-defined Fields </H3>

<P>
FundStation provides over one-hundred and twenty user-defined
fields of various types. Users have tremendous flexibility in
customizing their use of FundStation.
<H3>On-line, Real-time Status </H3>

<P>
FundStation provides users with an instantaneous status of each
fund and each client. Users see at a glance what work has been
completed and what still remains.
<H3>Data Repository </H3>

<P>
FundStation stores historical NAVs, rates and other pricing data
for as long as required. Reports and data files can be recreated
on an historical basis. Yields and rates of return can be calculated
as of any date stored in the database.
<H3>Flexible Reporting </H3>

<P>
FundStation provides the tools to create both predefined and ad-hoc
reports using any of the data stored in FundStation. Reports are
easy to build, even easier to run and can be set up to run right
from FundStation's main menu. Confluence is available to assist
in building additional reports, as needed.
<H3>System Calendar </H3>

<P>
Specify processing and non-processing days for each fund. FundStation
uses the calendars to determine the number of days for which a
rate is valid, based on weekend, end-of-the-month, and dividend
cycle considerations.
<H3>System Security </H3>

<P>
Restrict users to only authorized activities and funds. Access
is maintained by a System Administrator.
<H3>Process Control </H3>

<P>
During daily processing, users can require that each fund must
be manually released prior to FundStation distributing any of
its data. On-line review of tolerance reports and Daily Fund Profiles
ensure that all data is correct prior to its release. FundStation
also keeps an audit trail of all system activity. Authorized users
can determine what activities happened, when they happened and
who performed them.
<H3>Data Conversion </H3>

<P>
Confluence will convert historical data from any existing system
to FundStation. This allows for calculation of yields and rates
of return on the first day of live processing.

says, &quot;We were looking for a system that would allow us to
calculate our mutual fund returns in the most efficient and accurate
manner. We also wanted to centralize all performance functions,
including those done by our external fund administrator. FundStation
will minimize our manual data entry and spreadsheet calculations,
and we can store NAVs and rates of return for internal and external
dissemination. The e-mail and fax server capabilities will greatly
enhance the timeliness of our mutual fund data distribution.&quot;

<P>
<B>PITTSBURGH, Pa. - July 16, 1996 - </B>Confluence Technologies,
a Pittsburgh-based provider of software for the mutual fund industry

<P>
Caroline Sussman, Relationship Manager for Confluence Technologies,
says, &quot;With FundStation, Lord Abbett has replaced the rush
to rekey daily pricing information into Nasdaq terminals by 5:40
p.m. with the automated delivery of this information to Nasdaq
as soon as it is ready. The same technology can also automate
the delivery of Lord Abbett's pricing information to any number
of other places, including customers, a transfer agent, a voice
response unit, or even the Internet.&quot;<BR>
<P>
&quot;We believe that we can satisfy our customers best by automating
as much of the daily pricing distribution as possible,&quot; said
John Gargana, Chief Financial Officer at Lord Abbett. &quot;Adding
FundStation to our daily processing routine gives us one more
opportunity to focus our time and effort where it counts - on
customer service.&quot;<BR>

CONFLUENCE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. LAUNCHES AUTOMATED FEED OF MUTUAL
FUND NET ASSETS VALUES TO NASDAQ 
</CENTER>
</H2>

<P>
<STRONG>PITTSBURGH, Pa. - December 4, 1995</STRONG><B> - </B>Confluence
Technologies, software developer for the mutual fund and trust
industries, today announced the introduction of NAVFeed, an automated
interface to Nasdaq. NAVFeed allows mutual fund companies to transmit
their end-of-day prices (NAVs) to the stock market without manually
rekeying fund information on Nasdaq workstations, both reducing
reporting errors and ensuring that prices arrive on time. Inaugurating
this service with the San Francisco-based Ameristock Mutual Fund,
Confluence becomes the first and only third-party company to deliver
a stand-alone automated solution to the industry. Originally developed
as an extension of its flagship software product, FundStation,
Confluence now plans to offer NAVFeed as both a stand-alone product
and as a service bureau that receives price information over the
Internet.
<P>
Currently, most fund service companies transmit end-of-day prices
to Nasdaq for publication in daily newspapers by manually entering
them on Nasdaq terminals. &quot;The unique feature of Confluence's
service is that it accommodates every level of fund service provider,&quot;
says Service Bureau Director, Kirk Botula. &quot;The largest companies
can transmit their numbers over a direct leased line, while the
smallest can route their information through the Service Bureau.
Clients can tailor the way they send their information to Nasdaq.&quot;
<P>
Ameristock Director, Nicholas Gerber, is enthusiastic about the
new service. &quot;Confluence enables us to compete with larger
fund complexes, because the service they offer is flexible and
affordable. The only alternative to the Service Bureau for smaller
funds is the hassle of sending NAVs and other fund information
manually. &quot;
<P>
Confluence President, Michael Schiller agrees, &quot;NAVFeed provides
the foundation for complete automation of information distribution
at all levels of the industry.&quot;
<P>
Kirk Botula adds, &quot;We are providing real value to our users
who pass their data through the Service Bureau. We will soon calculate
performance reports and deliver daily fund profiles to key clients
via fax, email, data transfer, and the World Wide Web.&quot;
<P>
Confluence Technologies, Inc. works exclusively with clients in
the trust, investment management, and mutual fund industries.
The company builds PC applications that work in a client/server
environment and complement existing mainframe applications. Confluence
Technologies is a Microsoft Solutions Provider, a member the Pittsburgh
High Technology Council and a service member of the National Investment
Company Service Association.
<P>
Ameristock Mutual Fund is a no-load, value based, domestic equity
mutual fund that invests in large capitalization companies.

Inc. Announces Software to Serve Smaller Fund Services Companies</FONT></B>
<P>
<B>PITTSBURGH, Pa. - July 25, 1995 - </B>Confluence Technologies,
a Pittsburgh-based provider of software for the mutual fund and
trust industries, announced today that it has made automated distribution
of mutual fund and collective fund information available to smaller
fund complexes, with the introduction of a scaled-down version
of its flagship product, FundStation. Confluence has first installed
this product, which still carries the FundStation name, at Harris
Bank and Trust, N.A., in Chicago. <BR>
<P>
The modified FundStation extracts daily net asset values (NAVs)
for Harris' collective funds used in customers' retirement plans
and transmits them directly to the recordkeeping system used by
Harris' participant recordkeeping vendor. The fully-automated
transfer of information eliminates the need for phone calls, faxes
and manual data entry on both sides of the information exchange.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;As we moved the participant recordkeeping services to a
new vendor, we needed a way to efficiently and easily get NAV
and distribution information to them every day in a timely fashion,&quot;
said Ron Piarowski, Manager of Fund Accounting at Harris Bank.
&quot;The new version of FundStation makes it both easy and cost-effective
to automate this process.&quot;<BR>
<P>
&quot;We have been planning to introduce a version of FundStation
tailored to the needs of smaller fund complexes,&quot; says FundStation
Product Manager, James M. Szuch. &quot;We realize that smaller
shops have the same need to automate the distribution of mutual
fund information as their larger competitors - perhaps more so
- if they are to provide the level of service that will keep them
competitive and satisfy their customers.&quot;<BR>
<P>
&quot;The new version of FundStation is scaled to provide exactly
the features required by the customer, who pays only for the features
he does use,&quot; said Szuch. &quot;Confluence expects that the
continued growth of defined-contribution retirement plans and
the competition driving plans to same-day valuations will create
many opportunities for similar installations of FundStation.&quot;

<P>
<B>PITTSBURGH, April 15, 1995 - </B>Confluence Technologies, Inc.,
a Pittsburgh-based software company, has signed a contract to
install its mutual fund processing software product, FundStation,
at 440 Financial Group. FundStation automates many of the processes
that most mutual fund back offices currently perform manually.
440 becomes the second large provider of mutual fund services
to license FundStation, after SEI Corporation licensed the product
earlier this year.<BR>
<P>
&quot;440 has experienced tremendous growth, and FundStation will
allow us to continue to meet our commitments to clients in a timely
and cost-effective manner,&quot; said John J. Burke III, Director
of Funds Accounting, 440. &quot;Even more importantly, with FundStation
we can continue to tailor our service for each customer, which
is part of the basis for our success. Since we process more than
116 funds, this is no trivial task.&quot;<BR>
<P>
FundStation is a client/server application running under Microsoft
Windows. The system automates the collection of net asset values
and dividend rates into a central database, calculates yields
and total rates of return for each fund, and distributes all this
information to internal and external clients and systems. These
systems include the voice response unit, shareholder and participant
recordkeeping systems and several trust accounting systems.<BR>
<P>
&quot;The installation at 440 demonstrates FundStation's ability
to handle a large number of funds with a high degree of customization
for each fund family,&quot; said Michael J. Schiller, President
of Confluence Technologies, Inc. &quot;440 will realize significant
productivity gains in both the daily distribution of pricing data,
and from the monthly performance reporting supplied by FundStation.
Simple things like displaying total rates of return on the daily
reports can give 440 a real competitive edge.&quot;<BR>

<H1>Benefits of FundStation</H1>

<P>
The benefits of FundStation cross many organizational boundaries.
Since it can be difficult to factor them all into the cost/benefit
decision before you have had a chance to actually use FundStation,
we have created the following list of questions. This list is
intended to help you consider all the ways that FundStation can
benefit your operation. 
<P>
Think about each of the following areas in which FundStation can
play a cost-reduction or revenue-enhancing role. In all cases,
FundStation provides solutions to these questions, eliminates
manual effort, eliminates errors and provides more and better
options for disseminating mutual fund information to all of your
audiences. We feel confident that as you explore this list, the
true value and benefits of FundStation will become apparent.
<H2>Fund Accounting </H2>

<UL>
<LI>How much time does your fund accounting team spend every day
preparing reports of daily pricing information for distribution
to clients? How much time do they spend checking and rechecking
the values to ensure correctness before sending the report?

<UL>
<LI>How much time does your team spend every day creating summary
reports for management that indicate how well the funds are performing?

in order to distribute these reports to the desired recipients
before they go home at night?

of the daily report? 
</UL>

<UL>

the auditors? How much time could you save if, with the click

<UL>
<LI>How much time does your team spend generating reports of NAVs
and rates of return since inception of a fund for the auditors
review?

<CENTER><H1>Editorial</H1><P>
From the inaugural issue published in the Fall, 1995</CENTER><BR>

	We have long thought it remarkable that, although the ocean covers 70.92 percent of the Earth's surface, and an immense number of people occupy themselves on and under its waters (often with great passion and purpose), there is no periodical devoted solely to chronicling the wide range of events occurring in this vast realm. Marine Watch, a quarterly news journal of which this is the first issue, is a modest attempt to fulfill such a purpose. <P>
	We launch this endeavor with reverence, mindful that the sea is not only one of Nature's greatest forces, magnificent and unfathomable, but as well the setting of great historical events and the crucible of a tradition and ethos that transcend politics and nationality. We are aware, too, that we are addressing the interests of an informed readership, men and women who collectively possess an extraordinary range of expertise and a deep appreciation of the marine world and the lore of the sea. <P>
	This global ocean community is roughly comprised of two groups. On the one hand are scientists, researchers, skilled specialists and scholars in government, academia, and the private sector whose work involves the marine world and the earth sciences (their number and diversity of disciplines is extraordinary).  And on the other are professional mariners, sailors, boaters, underwater archeologists, sport and commercial fishers, surfers, divers, treasure salvers, and blue water adventurers. The impression we have gained from a quarter century of writing about the ocean, and ocean people, is that each group is keenly interested in the experiences of the other, has a lot to share, and would be pleased to share it. Our hope is that Marine Watch will prove a worthy venue for such an exchange. To this end we invite our readers to contact us with news of their activities, experiences and items of interest. <P>
	As a glance at this issue's table of contents suggests, the scope of Marine Watch's interests is broad: shipwrecks and rescues, scientific discoveries, undersea exploration, treasure salvage, blue water cruising, surf stories, sea stories, unusual ice berg calving, severe weather, ocean oddities, and offshore oil field diving, to name only a few. <P>
	Regardless of the subject, the writing is geared for readers with a high level of comprehension. We don't expect every surfer or sailor to be conversant with Doppler hook echoes and Kelvin waves, nor every scientist to know what a backside layback stall is, or a helium unscrambler, or the difference between a checkerboard and a trawl door. However, in providing substantive, in-depth reporting, Marine Watch will not avoid <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="grissim.gif" ALT="[photo of John Grissam]">the technical or the arcane. We believe our readers have the expertise and the marine experience to dope out what they need to know - and prefer it that way. <P>
	Our editorial philosophy is, in general, non-political, but underlying much that will be reported will be an implicit awareness of the environmental emergency that has begun to manifest in Earth's oceans.  We are concerned less with the lubberly disputes of shore folk than with accurate reporting about things that actually happen. Wherever possible, we will go to the source. Our objective is to convey the unalloyed power of events, told first hand by the participants in their own voices. In so doing, Marine Watch will be better able to convey (and on occasion celebrate) the profound affinity and love that the worldwide ocean community has for the waves and waters of that realm from whence we all came, the ineffable Great Deep. <P>

<H1>Rare, violent tornadic waterspout<BR>
strikes the Pamlico Sound</H1> Spin-up mechanisms rather than mesocyclones may prove to be their defining characteristic</CENTER>
<P>
On Monday afternoon, July 11, 1994, Arthur Duke, a news reporter and cameraman for WCTI TV of New Bern, North Carolina, was aboard a 20-foot outboard powered boat on the four-mile wide expanse of the nearby Neuse River where it opens onto the Pamlico Sound. <P>
"I was with Rick Dove who runs the River Keeper, a pollution patrol boat sponsored by the Neuse River Foundation, looking for evidence of a reported fish kill," Duke recalls. "It was a hot sultry day with few clouds and no wind. The water was flat calm with the temperature in the 80s. But the air was very thick, like the sky was going to drop at any minute.  In the distance we could see clouds coming together. They seemed to be forming a line right over the river." <P>
Nearing the river's tree-lined south shore a few miles from Cherry Point just after 4 p.m., Duke was up forward scanning the water for signs of dead fish when behind him Dove,  standing at  the steering console,  cried "Oh, my god!"<P>

"I turned around and saw the biggest thing I've ever seen in my life, just huge, looking exactly like a tornado, no more than half a mile away from us as we looked east down the sound.  We both froze. The thing was shooting up into the sky,  a giant swirling motion.  You could see the water spinning in the center. We figured it had to be three hundred feet wide, the length of a football field. "<P>
	"Tornado!" Rick yelled. I grabbed my  video camera and said 'Let me get a couple of shots.'" He said "Do it fast! That thing is heading right towards us!"  As I filmed I noticed in the distance another boat much closer to the funnel and it was making a run for it. I  shot a little less than a minute of tape before I put the camera down and Rick started to move out. He's been on the water for 30 years,  a very experienced boater - and he was very nervous. He said "That's the biggest one I've ever seen. It'll tear the boat apart!" <P>
	With nowhere to dock or safely tie up on the river's tree-lined south bank, Dove gunned his boat out into the river, heading at full throttle for the north shore and the harbor at Fairfield. Moments of terror followed: <P>
	"It appeared to be coming after us. Suddenly dark clouds formed and it started raining violently, a torrential rain. And high wind and tremendous thunder. We could see lightening coming from the clouds striking the funnel. Then we lost sight of it in the rain. My first thought was the tornado was moving much faster than us,  sucking us towards it." <P>
	Duke had the presence of mind to reach for his cell phone and call his news director at the station: "Over the noise I yelled 'We're on the river, there's a huge tornado moving towards us, and we're hauling ass!" She said she was praying for us.  They called the Coast Guard, the Marines at nearby Cherry Point, everyone." <P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="4">"I yelled 'We're on the river, there's a huge tornado moving towards us,<BR>
 and we're hauling ass!" She said she was praying for us..."</FONT></B></CENTER><P>


	At that moment in nearby Minnesott Beach, Garvin Hardison was sitting at his desk in his office at Hardison Realty, right on the bank of the Neuse River where he has lived for 60 years. <P>
	"I happened to look out the window and saw a huge tornado on the river less than a mile away. I thought it was coming towards me.  I was damn scared. Then in a heartbeat a terribly violent storm hit.  I rushed out of my office and was getting in my truck to escape when my son met me and said not to worry, that he had just got off the ferry from the south side and the thing was heading towards Cherry Point across from us. I managed to get a Polaroid picture of the spout but by the time I did it was already getting smaller." <P>
	Out on the water in the blinding rain and choppy water, Rick Dove neared shore, running over crab pot floats as he approached the Fairfield Harbor, hoping that the prop would not become fouled in the lines.  It didn't and the pair arrived safely at dockside. So did the boat Duke had seen moments earlier near the funnel.  That vessel had been carrying 20 children staying at the Minnesott Beach YMCA camp. Reporter Duke hitched a ride to New Bern and arrived on the set dripping wet to deliver a live report on the five o'clock news as the raw video footage was aired. "My life had flashed before my eyes," he later confessed. "But the story comes first." <P>
<CENTER><B>As powerful as the Dinner Key event</B></CENTER><P>
	According to witnesses aboard a state ferry that runs between Cherry Point and Minnesot Beach, the spout lasted about 20 minutes, from 4:05 to 4:25 p.m. Crew members estimated the funnel's height at 2,500-3,000 feet. Strangely, there appeared to be no evidence of circulation at the cloud base (as happens with tornadoes). "The power that thing had to have was unreal," reported crew member Harold Thomas.  "It was just awesome."  In the immediate aftermath he Coast Guard conducted a search for a 25-foot sailboat feared capsized by the funnel cloud but the boat's captain later called to report he was safe. All told, except for some minor property damage caused by high winds, the spout had caused no damage or casualties. <P>
	The citizens of the Neuse River were lucky.  In the aftermath, interviews of witnesses and photogrammetric analysis of Duke's video, as well as photographs taken by others, strongly suggest the Cherry Point waterspout resembled the infamous Florida waterspout that in 1968 ravaged Dinner Key on the outskirts of Miami, causing injuries and property damage in the many thousands. <P>
	"The Cherry Point waterspout was very much on par with the Dinner Key event," concludes Joseph Golden, director of NOAA's Atmospheric Modification Program, after analyzing the data. "Its visual appearance suggests if it had come on shore it would have been equally, or more, destructive than the Dinner Key event." <P>
	Dr. Golden,  a world authority on waterspouts who has devoted a career to the study of vortical storms, obtained several stills taken by a witness that clearly reveal a double wall structure to the Cherry Point funnel. "My experience in the Florida Keys suggest that when you have that structure, the waterspout is most intense and most destructive. You actually have a double wind maximum when you have a double funnel. But such events are rare in the Keys - rare everywhere. But when that happens such spouts are exceptionally dangerous." <P>
	What intrigues Dr. Golden is that the Cherry Point waterspout, like the one at Dinner Key - and a third funnel he witnessed on Matecumbe Key in September, 1967 - did not appear to be spawned by conditions on the water, a defining characteristic of classic waterspout formation (see side bar). <P>
	"Common waterspouts, because of the nature of the environment in which they form and the structure of their parent clouds, tend to weaken when they come on shore. Whereas the Dinner Key and Matecumbe Key tornadic spouts maintained great intensity when they moved from water to land, and, as happened at Dinner Key,  from land to water." <P>
	So what were they? In simplest terms, Golden suggests they  were tornadoes at sea, yet, as  with the Cherry Point waterspout, both were highly unusual, a hybrid of a classic Midwest tornado and a large waterspout, and as such deserving of a separate niche in the tornadic hierarchy. <P>
	Golden believes that with this type of tornadic water waterspout, the character of the underlying boundary - land or water -  appears to be of least importance in determining whether or not one of these vortices is going to form. "What's of fundamental importance is that you have an environment conducive to the formation and growth of a very strong convective cloud line. Typically, cloud lines that produce tornadic waterspouts have tops twenty-five to thirty-thousand feet and are growing explosively. In contrast, cloud tops  over waterspouts in the Keys are initially only fifteen to twenty thousand feet." <P>
<CENTER><B>Synoptic scale analysis</B></CENTER><P>
	To help determine if such conditions existed the day of the Cherry Point incident, Golden contacted  meteorologist Carin Goodall-Gosnell of the National Weather Service's office in Newport, N.C., only 15 miles away from the waterspout's location. The two conducted a thorough synoptic analysis of mesoscale conditions (phenomenon on the order of a few kilometers to a few hundred kilometers),  studied surface frontal positions, temperatures, dew points, winds, GOES 7 Satellite imagery, and data provided by the recently installed, state-of-the-art WSR-88D  NEXRAD Doppler Radar data (see side bar). <P>
	They found that on the afternoon  of July 11th there were present several distinct microscale boundaries, two of which intersected directly above the Neuse River near Cherry Point, North Carolina (this distinctive cloud line was probably what TV reporter Art Duke observed just prior to the waterspout's appearance).  Further, there appeared to be enhanced low level convergence between the two boundaries, a factor that Golden's previous research showed plays a key role in waterspout formation. <P>
	Only limited velocity data during the event was archived on the WSR-88D, but what interested Golden was the absence of any mesocyclone or velocity couplets in the lowest 1.5 degree elevation scan immediately prior to, or during, the waterspout's 20 minute life cycle.  While he could not rule out the possibility that parent  <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="spout.gif" ALT="[waterspout photo]">circulation may have existed at a higher altitude than the 88D scanned, indications were that the kind of mesocyclone associated with the formation of classic Midwest tornadoes was absent.<BR>

<HR>

	So what caused the Cherry Point tornadic waterspout? <P>
	"We think the low level convergence of those two well-defined boundaries over the Neuse River that afternoon provided the spin-up mechanism that spawned that waterspout," Golden explains. He adds that follow-up research on mesoscale environments and parent cloud structure will be conducted at the North Carolina office during the next two years to develop pattern recognition schemes to help forecast waterspouts. <P>
<B><CENTER><FONT SIZE="4">"I witnessed some shocking stupidity by mariners out there in recreational power boats and yachts."</FONT></CENTER></B>
	Adding credence to Golden's hypothesis are data being developed by Project Vortex in Oklahoma. The largest tornado field project ever attempted, the $3.5 million effort (funded by NOAA and the National Science Foundation), is making extensive use of NEXRAD-developed information. Surprisingly, a  number of tornadoes have been recorded showing no detectable mesocyclone associated with their formation. "It now appears that some tornadoes spin up from the ground, which is what I think is the primary process for most waterspouts," Golden says. <P>
	Similarly, in recent years storm chasers on the plains in the Midwest have been documenting the frequent (and seldom reported) appearance  of weak tornadoes  that greatly resemble Florida Keys waterspouts, so much so that they have been dubbed landspouts.  For his part, Golden is uncomfortable with  the term because he feels it may give the public a false sense of security. <P>
	"Your chances of getting hit by one are very low because the vortex is so small, but you could die if you get hit. And if your house is hit, damage could be severe. Their wind speed range is generally F-zero to F-one  [75mph-100 mph] on the one-to-five scale." <P>
	The same precautions apply for waterspouts. "I can't stress enough that all waterspouts are potentially lethal at certain times in their life cycle. And the bigger they are, the more dangerous." <P>
<CENTER><B>Mariners' important role</B></CENTER><P>
	In August, 1993, Golden served as chief scientist and movie camera operator in a week-long field program conducted by NOAA and the National Geographic Society, using a helicopter and a chase plane to film the most detailed movies ever taken of waterspouts. "We found and filmed over a dozen waterspouts and I witnessed some shocking stupidity by mariners out there in recreational power boats and yachts. Once we watched and filmed in horror as one guy in a power boat chased a waterspout and intercepted the spray vortex, fortunately as it was weakening. The meteorologist-in-charge at the Key West weather service office told us that this happens all the time and that people have gotten into trouble but they don't want the authorities to know about it, probably  for insurance reasons." <P>
	Waterspout footage from Golden's remarkable field observations will be aired on NBC in the fall as part of a National Geographic Special titled "Cyclones" and which will include  segments on Hurricane Andrew and tornado chasing in the Midwest. <P>
	Golden maintains that mariners, particularly in the Keys, can serve an important role as volunteer spotters, especially now that so many have cell phones on board. They should never assume that no one cares when a funnel cloud appears, and that there's nothing to worry about if the funnel doesn't extend down to the water. <P>
	"It's true that less than half the funnels ever reach the spray vortex stage, but don't assume it has to touch the water. In my experience whenever a visible funnel extends downward more than forty to fifty percent of the way, you have a complete and mature and potentially life threatening waterspout in progress. A significant portion of that column may not be visible, and the wind speed in the spray vortex at the sea surface - where the greatest danger to mariners exists - can easily be fifty-to one hundred knots or more." <P>
	Not surprisingly, the core speeds of the larger tornadic waterspouts are much higher. The most intense one Golden has documented had a maximum velocity in the spray vortex of 88 meters per second, or over 200 mph - "and it was an anticyclonic vortex." Field research indicates that about one in every ten waterspouts rotate anticyclonically, depending on the direction of the causative wind currents. <P>
	Despite this and other discoveries about waterspouts and their tornadic half-breed relatives, mysteries remain, not only about the mechanics of their formation, but about vortex structure and its radial-vertical motion.  Doubtless Golden and his associates who study tornadogenesis,  aided by  the WSR-88D and other tools using breakthrough technologies, will learn much more in the years ahead. In the meantime, mariners out on the water would be well-advised to give these fascinating phenomena a wide and respectful berth. <P>

<H2>TREASURE SALVAGE</H2><P>
<H1>Searchers find WWII Japanese submarine<BR>
intact 3.2 miles deep</H1>
Boat was carrying two tons of gold for Nazis when sunk in mid-Atlantic by Allied ambush</CENTER>

<P>


	In a stunning demonstration of cold war technology in the service of  private enterprise, a team of Americans on a chartered Russian research ship early this spring found the virtually intact wreck of the Japanese Imperial Navy submarine I-52 at a depth of 17,000 feet in the mid-Atlantic 1200 miles west of the Cape Verde Islands. The large, specially built boat, which was ambushed and sunk June 23, 1944 by Allied Forces, was enroute to Nazi-occupied France with 290 metric tons of strategic metals for delivery to the German war machine, including  two metric tons (4,409 lbs.) of gold valued at $25 million. <P>
	The discovery was a personal triumph for Paul R. Tidwell, 47, a maritime researcher from Hemphill, Texas who five years ago began his hunt for the warship in the National Archives in Washington, DC,  <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="submarine3.gif" ALT="[sonar image of sub]">examining newly declassified war documents that held clues to the boat's resting place. <!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->

<HR>
<P>
	"It's almost unbelievable - we found her on the first voyage," said an elated Tidwell who described the discovery as his personal Mount Everest. "This has been quite a journey for me, with more than its share of twists and turns." <P>
Tidwell and his backers intend to begin salvaging the vessel's gold and artifacts before the end of 1996. They estimate recovery costs at $8 million. Depending on the obstacles, they may eventually attempt to raise the warship as well. If they do, they will not only have completed the deepest commercial salvage on record (the I-52 is 3.2 miles deep compared to the Titanic at 2.5 miles), they will also have brought to the surface the object of one of the great sea stores of World War II. <P>
	"The I-52 is a fascinating story, in several ways more interesting, I think, than the Titanic and the Bismarck," said military historian Carl Boyd of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., and a specialist on Japanese-German relations, cryptographic intelligence, and submarine warfare. <P>
 	Commissioned in December, 1943, the I-52 was one of only three in its class, designed not as attack boats, but cargo submarines capable of carrying hundreds of tons of war materiel, traveling underwater by day and cruising on the surface by night while recharging batteries, thus avoiding Allied detection. At 357 feet long, they were leviathans as long as a football field, far larger than the American subs of the day (which were around 306 feet). While the I-52's  propulsion plants was comparatively small (about 6,000 hp. compared to 11,000 hp. for most Japanese subs), the increased fuel capacity gave her an enormous cruising range of 21,000 nautical miles. Flank speed was a respectable 17 knots. <P>
	In March, 1944, the I-52 left the sub base at Kure, not far from Hiroshima on Japan's Honshu Island, carrying, in addition to the gold, 228 tons of molybdenum, tungsten and tin - plus 14 experts from Japanese industrial firms such as Mitsubishi. They were aboard to meet with their German counterparts in occupied France to get desperately needed German technology in exchange for raw materials the Nazi's were equally desperate to obtain. <P><CENTER><H2>"When the I-52 entered the Atlantic, its ... predicted route was relayed to a special American Navy task force that had Ultra Access."</H2></CENTER></B><P>


	After a stop in Singapore to refuel and pick up 54 tons of raw rubber and three tons of quinine, the I-52 headed for the Indian Ocean in late April, anticipating an undetected passage around the Horn enroute to Lorient, France. But since the British and Americans had previously broken the top secret military codes of both Germany and Japan, Allied intelligence was intercepting and deciphering the I-52's reports to Tokyo and Berlin. <P>
	"That's how we knew what they were carrying," Boyd said. "They'd radioed their manifest to Berlin. We also intercepted the sub's daily position reports so when the I-52 entered the Atlantic, its position and predicted route was relayed to a special American Navy task force that had Ultra Access - the code word for cryptological intelligence." <P>
	The principle warship of the task force was the USS Bogue, a Jeep carrier (a small carrier escort less than 10,000 tons displacement) that carried only a few planes, mostly Avenger bombers specially designed to track down and destroy submarines using bombs and torpedoes. <P>
	On the night on June 23, 1944, the I-52 rendezvoused with a German sub and took aboard two German radio operators and a radar detector that was intended to be installed and operational by the time the I-52 reached European waters. The great boat continued on the surface at 15 knots on that moonless night, unaware that an Avenger bomber piloted by Lieutenant Commander Jesse D. Taylor launched from the Bogue had picked up the sub on its radar. Minutes later the dark sky around the I-52 suddenly burst into light as the plane dropped flares to illuminate its target. As the sub began a desperate emergency dive, the Avenger dropped two 500-lb bombs. They narrowly missed their target. <P>
	The sub disappeared beneath a long boil of white water. But even as it sought safety in a high angle descent, the I -52's fate was sealed. Commander Taylor deployed acoustic buoys over a square mile of sea and within minutes he and his crew could clearly hear in their headsets the rhythmic churning of the I-52's propellers. Taylor maneuvered into position above the fleeing sub and released his one remaining, but formidable, weapon:  a powerful torpedo with an acoustic detection and guidance system that was extremely new at the time. After a long tense wait, the Avenger's crew heard a loud explosion - then silence. The following afternoon a Japanese sandal and pieces of silk, presumably debris from the I-52, were found floating in the vicinity. <P>
	<P>
	For nearly half a century the precise location of the I-52's final resting place remained unsolved until Paul Tidwell, researching recently declassified World War II naval records in the National Archives, found the log books of the USS Bogue and related documents that described the events of June 23, 1994, including the location of the attack on the I-52. Armed with his startling discovery, Tidwell convinced a private investor to put upwards of a million dollars into his company, AU Holdings, following which he approached Sound Ocean Systems a Seattle-based company to tackle a formidable technical challenge - locating the wreck using a side scan sonar towed at a precise height of 30 meters above a sea floor characterized by uneven topography that included mountains and ridges.  Moreover, even with the reliable Lat-Long coordinates provided by ship's logs, the search area for the I-52 was still roughly 100 square miles, amounting to a lot of unexplored real estate 3.2 miles down. <P>
	But these daunting requirements were familiar territory to Sound Ocean Systems. The Seattle, Washington-based company has wide industry experience in deep water search endeavors using state-of-the art sonar technology. SOSI has also designed and built sophisticated robots successfully used in a variety of missions at extreme depths.  "Sound Ocean Systems is the real hero in putting this thing together," Tidwell added. <P>
	"Paul came to us to put the program together," said Ted Brockett, SOSI's president. "And we recommended  Bob Cooke of our staff as project manager. We then sub-contracted with Tom Detweiller of Meridian Sciences to be the overall operational director. Tom would also be  in charge of surface processing and post-processing of data." <P>
 	In addition to providing its powerful Orion computer system to handle the processing tasks, Maryland-based Meridian Sciences regularly contracts with the US Navy to provide re-navigation for American subs, using post-mission data, gyrocompass errors and other factors to derive extremely accurate plots and positions. The company was a natural to do a thorough, computer-assisted, re-calculation of the American fleet's movements the night of the attack to refine the I-52's location and translate it into modern-day GPS coordinates. <P>
<CENTER><H2>"Seeing that image was one hell of a rush."</H2></CENTER>
	Equally suited for the mission was the Russian ship Yuzhmorgeologiya, a well-appointed 330-foot research vessel that had seen clandestine service during the cold war detecting and tracking U.S. submarines. Following the break-up of the Soviet Union, the Russian government dumped the vessel with its sophisticated equipment (including 20,000 feet of cable, side scan sonar, and a camera sled) onto the commercial market where, by early 1995, the vessel was in Long Beach, California.  Sound Ocean Systems chartered the Yuzhmorgeologiya with her Russian crew of 50. <P>
	"We used their sonar, a MAK-1M, and it's pretty good," Brockett explained. "It's a dual frequency system - 30 kilohertz and 100 kilohertz - but they don't have a lot of surface processing capability and/or post-processing capability, which is what Meridian Science's Orion system has. It took a little bit of screwing around to get an interface but not much. We also had two deep water camera systems on board, the Russian Neptune system and a system that we put together." <P>
	In early April the Yuzhmorgeologiya left Long Beach and two weeks later picked up Tidwell and 11 other members of the American search team in Barbados. Due to other commitments, Brockett himself couldn't make the voyage. Five days later the vessel reached its planned search area. In calm seas and pre-hurricane season weather that Tidwell called "boringly perfect," the team began a slow methodical survey. The mood was calm and professional with a strong undercurrent of excitement. <P>
	"There was a lot of geology down there," Tidwell said. "Mountain ranges ran north and south, created by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, but after two or three lines of survey we pretty much knew where they were going to be and could anticipate bringing the gear up and down to compensate for depth. the Russians ran that part of the gear and they did remarkably well keeping the side scan about 100 feet off the bottom." <P>
	Because configuration limitations in the Russian-American computer interface prevented real-time processing, incoming data (output on strip chart tape) was archived on Exabyte tape, together with date-time and locational information. Tidwell: "All 	 <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="submarine.gif" ALT="[submarine photo]">the data was copied to a magneto-optical drive which basically enabled us to playback things faster and post-process data at the end of each survey line. It all turned out to be very accurate. We could see the geological features passing by on the bottom, as well as those on the next line over picked up by the opposite channel.

Only one major uncertainty remained as they began their methodical day and night scanning of a roughly 100 square mile search area. While the searchers were relying on the ships' logbooks of the Allied task force for the I-52's location, they also had the I-52's position from another logbook, this one from the German U-boat whose captain who had seen the bomber's flares while witnessing the attack - but the latter's coordinates disagreed with the Allied location by several miles. In addition, the location of the floating debris found the day following the sinking didn't seem to square with the prevailing wind and current. For this reason, prior to his departure on the voyage, Tidwell had given Meridian Sciences all the ships' logs from the American fleet as well as the  logs from the German U-boat, requesting a thorough re-calculation to see if a more reliable position could be developed. <P>
	Days of  scanning continued without any sign of the I-52. Worry and frustration mounted as Tidwell, together with Tom Detweiller and Bob Cooke spent long hours doing their own recalculations. Then Meridian Sciences checked in by radio with the results of its extensive analysis - their revised position still put the I-52 within the planned search area. Several more days passed. Tension grew as the Yuzhmorgeologiya neared completion of the survey area.  Then, suddenly, dramatically, a distinct image appeared on the screen, one that even at 30 kHz showed a recognizable profile. Ted Brockett , a scientist by training, characterized it as "a target of very serious interest."  Tidwell described the moment less dispassionately: "Seeing that image was one hell of a rush." <P>
	The team went back in and made two high resolution passes at 100 kHz) and the resulting images made them all but certain they had found her. Next,  they deployed a Russian-made long base line acoustic navigation system. Called Asmod, the system consists of three or four transponders placed on the sea floor around the site. They can be triggered to transmit a locational signal in response to a interrogation/responder unit mounted on a camera sled. Brockett: <P>
	"By the time they found the, it was right at the end of the program. They had unfortunately taken on a load of bad fuel in Panama that was wreaking havoc on the engines. So they only made a couple of camera tows and one of them was right over the sub. We have a half a dozen good pictures of a portion of the sub. Unfortunately that's all we have. But it was enough to tell us we had what we were looking for. There'll be more to follow." <P>
	"The German sub's re-navigated position ended up being ten or so miles off," Tidwell explained. "But the Allied fleet's position data was also off.  Meridian's re-plot from the American fleet's logs came up with a re-navigated position for the I-52 that was within less than half a mile of her actual location.  It was just  phenomenal!" <P>
	Tidwell sensational find (announced in July and publicized world-wide) has not gone unchallenged. In August, a fellow Texas treasure hunter, Larry Barbernell, claiming that Tidwell and fellow marine researcher Eugene Lyon took research on the I-52 that was his exclusively, said he would seek a restraining order preventing any salvage efforts. Tidwell does not appear seriously concerned. Elsewhere, the Japanese Government has objected to the salvage plans, in part because the wreck is also a grave. Tidwell, a former Army infantryman who served two tours in Vietnam and won a Purple Heart, has pledged to disturb the site as little as possible. He plans to travel to Japan to discuss the matter with Japanese officials. <P>

<H1>Great white shark attacks<BR>
California scuba diver 40 feet underwater</H1>
Victim mirculously escapes serious injury, but new questions raised about u/w scooters</CENTER><P>


	A remarkably cool-headed diver operating a small electric scooter 40 feet underwater on California's Monterey coast June 30 escaped with only minor injuries after being attacked by a large great white shark.  The incident occurred in the late afternoon while Marco Flagg, 31, an electrical engineer from Moss Landing, Calif., and two friends,  Steve Larson and a woman who requested her name not be published,  were recreational scuba diving in calm waters from a 13' Zodiac inflatable in 90  <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="scooter.gif" ALT="[underwater scooter]">feet of open water 200 yards off of Blue Fish Cove, a popular dive site in the waters of Point Lobos State Reserve just south of Carmel. <!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->

<HR>

	About 5:20 p.m., Flagg, who holds both a PADI Advanced Open Water and a NOAA working diver certification, and is a veteran of more than 300 dives (including Cape Horn, the Arctic Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Caribbean), was on his second dive of the day, trying out Larson's scooter. "We had already done a 40 minute dive earlier that afternoon and conditions were very good," he said. "Flat calm, no swell with visibility ten feet at the surface and improving to about thirty on the bottom. The sea floor consisted of rocky outcroppings interspersed with sandy channels. No kelp was in the immediate vicinity. <P>
	 "About two minutes into the dive on a descent angle of twenty degrees I was down about fifty feet when I looked to my right and saw about twenty feet away a massive pectoral fin attached to a torpedo-shaped body of a large fish. That was at the edge of my visibility and the approximately five-foot section I saw did not include the dorsal fin or any part forward of the animal. It disappeared from view about two seconds later." <P>
 	Stunned by what appeared to be a white shark, Flagg immediately turned and headed back toward the boat maintaining a steady rate and shallow ascent angle. "I didn't want to provoke an air embolism or surface far from the boat since I knew many attacks occur on the surface." <P>
	Though apprehensive, the diver felt the odds were good that the shark was most likely just passing and would not attack: "Some of my dive buddies had seen sharks out there. I have a somewhat strange sense of humor but I was calm enough to think to myself 'Gee, and I got to see it without paying for a shark diving trip.' <P>
<CENTER><B>Massive, wide open mouth</B></CENTER><P>
	About 20 seconds after the sighting, Flagg was at 40 feet when he looked down and to his left. "I saw the massive, wide open, near circular, teeth-lined mouth of an animal coming at me and I thought 'Oh shit!' And a second later I felt a severe but dull pressure on my body." <P>
	An instant later (about two seconds, Flagg estimated)  the shark released its grip, freeing him.  Showing remarkable presence of mind, he reached down to make sure his legs were still intact, then continued upwards with the scooter at full throttle,  surfacing about 20 yards from the Zodiac. Reaching the boat, he opted to drop the scooter rather than try to lug it on board. Fearing attack at any second and not knowing the extent of is injuries, Flagg jettisoned his 22-lb. weight belt and quickly removed his tank, buoyancy compensator and regulator assembly. Climbing into the boat, he was attempting to haul his gear aboard when he fell back into the water. Scrambling back aboard as quickly as he could, Flagg immediately started the outboard engine and began revving it in neutral in short bursts as a warning to his companions still beneath him. <P>
	"I felt a dull pain in my gut but since I was still conscious I thought there was no big loss of blood. Steve surfaced three-to-five minutes later, and I told him I had been attacked. He handed me his video camera but it later fell back into the water due to an attached weight belt." LeCompte quickly came aboard. Anxious moments followed as the pair continued revving the motor. Several minutes later she surfaced, needing no warning to scramble aboard. She, too, had seen the shark, describing it "like a freight train going by underneath me." She had sought safety atop an underwater pinnacle until she felt safe enough to swim for the Zodiac. <P>
	Leaving the buoy in place to mark the location of the jettisoned gear, the trio proceeded immediately back to the boat ramp at Whaler's Cove, just around the corner from Blue Fish cove. Flagg managed to climb out had to sit down, feeling too weak to stand. <BR>
<CENTER><H3>"I saw the massive, wide-open, near-circular,<BR>
 teeth-lined mouth of the animal coming at me and I thought 'Oh,shit!'"</H3></CENTER>
	"He was amazingly lucky," said State Park Ranger Jerry Loomis who meet the divers at the ramp and radioed for paramedics. "And incredibly brave to handle himself the way he did." Loomis helped remove Flagg's quarter-inch thick Fathom  Wet suit (blue/black) and assist paramedics. "He was conscious but a little shocky. The left leg was oozing blood, and there was a pretty good puncture wound in the left shoulder but he wasn't bleeding much. His swim trunks had an obvious cut across the crotch but it didn't hit his genitals." <P>
	Flagg was transported to a hospital in Monterey where he received 15 stitches for bite injuries to his thigh, torso, and shoulder and released the following morning. <P>
	The attack was not the first to occur in Monterey Peninsula waters. In 1981, knee boarder Lou Boren was fatally attacked while surfing in Spanish Bay. Four years later, in Monastery Beach adjacent to the Pt. Lobos Reserve, free diver Frank Gallo, of Los Altos, California was bitten underwater, sustaining severe wounds that required more than 600 stitches. In 1990 off the same beach a Santa Paula, California woman survived a large bite on the leg. <P>
	"I'm extremely lucky, I guess," Flagg said during an interview from his Moss Landing office three days later. The German-born, naturalized U.S. citizen explained he had already written a detailed (and notably dispassionate) incident report that he intended to make available to the scientific and research community. Flagg had already turned down numerous interview requests from the tabloid press in the U.S. and overseas. <P>
	Subsequent examination of Flagg's dive gear revealed bite marks on the air tank and on the DiveTracker instrument console that had been attached on the high pressure hose hanging near the left side of his abdomen. The console is housed in a 8" x 3.5" x 2.5" aluminum box made of 1/4-inch thick aluminum. Thus, it appears Flagg had been sandwiched between, and protected by, the metal, which distributed the force of the bite. Flagg noted in his written  Ironically, the console is manufactured by Desert Star Systems, a small company that manufacturers underwater sonar-based navigation systems for scientific, military and commercial users, as well as sport divers - of which Flagg is the proprietor. <P>
At the time of the attack, Flagg's buddy Steve LeCompte was using a sports version of a DiveTraker navigation console. Flagg: "Steve was able to use the instrument to come right back to the boat. That made him very happy." <P>

In the aftermath, some in the commercial fishing community wondered if the scooter- either its noise or electromagnetic field - may have attracted the shark. Last December 9 off San Miguel Island, Santa Barbara urchin diver Jim Robinson,42, had been using a scooter just before he was fatally attacked by a white shark. Robinson had surfaced alongside his boat following a dive and had passed the scooter up to a crew member when he was fatally attacked by a white shark. <P>
	Scooters have been used by urchin divers for about six years to efficiently scout the sea floor for areas where urchin bed are the thickest.  But Flagg himself doubts such a connection: "My simple suspicion is that it was hungry and I just happened to run across its path. Incidents such as mine are so rare that it's impossible to draw any meaningful conclusions. <P>
	"The shark did not attack the scooter, but my mid-section," Flagg continued. "From what I understand, the shark's final approach is guided by sensing electrical fields using sensors in its snout [isle of Langorhams]. And while it's true that a  <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="console.gif" ALT="[photo of console]">scooter emits a strong DC  field, that field is uniform. I would suspect the animal is not attracted to field strength but to its variability. Because many things in the water, such as dock and harbor structures, generate a DC field. This contrasts with a field generated by an animal, like one with a heartbeat, is very erratic."<!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->
<HR>
<STRONG>At left</STRONG> The strong aluminum housing of this DiveTracker instrument probably saved its inventor's life.<!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->
<HR>

	However, some observers are beginning to suspect there may be a connection between scooters and white shark behavior. Dr. John McCosker of the California Academy of Sciences and a world authority on white sharks, recalled in 1980 having to release back into the wild a healthy baby great white shark (nicknamed Sandy, captured four days earlier) that begun bumping into the wall of the Steinhart Aquarium's Roundabout tank where an electronics expert subsequently  detected a minute, and static, electrical anomaly (about .125 millivolts) between two of the tank's windows. <P>
	McCosker also sites  his experiences studying the creatures <I>in situ </I>on Australia's Great Barrier Reef: "I've watched sharks come up and mouth the shark cages in a funny way. Not attack them, but mouth them in a way suggesting it is part of a bioelectric stimulation. Have we demonstrated it? No. But let me put it this way:  If a scuba diver forty feet down gets bitten, I would probably raise my eyebrows and ask What gives? Because that's almost unheard of. But  Flagg was forty feet down and holding on to a device pulsing an electrical DC field and making a noise, as it apparently did, that might incite a shark to mouth and bite, as it apparently did. That leads me to suspect that the scooter was probably contributory, but in ways we don't know. All the additional variables and attractive stimuli - sound, visual, electronic - complicate the issue. Sort of like Murder on the Orient Express. There are so many possible culprits. <P>
	Moreover, just how steady a scooter's DC field is in actual field use may also be open to question. Most scooters have three speed settings which divers routinely change during a dive. And each of these settings can result in a varying DC field as the battery runs down. Elsewhere, in recent years, commercial divers, especially abalone divers Northern California, have reported incidents of sharks being attracted to certain types of sound frequencies generated by marine equipment such as boat propellers. <P>
	Indications are some in the commercial fishing community, especially since the death of urchin diver Robinson, are not waiting for science to solve the mystery. Santa Barbara-based fisheries consultant (and Marine Watch correspondent) Mick Kronman reports that many area urchin divers are dumping their scooters. "Diver Ward Motyer, (who brought Robinson aboard his boat and tried unsuccessfully to save him) told me nobody before said scooter might attract sharks, but they're talking about it now. I'd say a significant number of stopped using them." <P>
	As for his own diving future, Marco Flagg said the incident would not deter him from diving again in those same waters - "the statistics show the probability of an attack on myself or anyone else there is extremely remote." <P>

<H2>Cargo ships in odd Gulf
of Mexico collision</H2></CENTER>
	Two cargo ships, the Greek vessel Alexia and the Singapore-flagged Enif collided in the Gulf of Mexico approximately 70 miles south of New Orleans near Southwest Pass around midnight on July 1st. As the vessels remained lodged together,drifting east at about 1 m.p.h., several nearby oil rigs in their path scrambled to evacuate their personnel until three tugs arrived to control the ships' drift.  About  <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="ships.gif"ALT="[photo of collision]">93,000 gallons of fuel leaked from a ruptured fuel tank on the Enif, eventually creating an oil sheen 19 miles long but posed no environmental hazard. <!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->

<HR>

	Both ships took on some water but neither were in danger of sinking, nor where there any injuries.  Coast Guard units, including a helicoptor and the 210-foot cutter Courageous soon arrived on the scene to find the 750-foot Alexia's bulbous bow imbedded just abaft of beam in the Enif's port side. Containment booms were placed around the vessels. Several days later, following some hot work with welding torches to cut loose mangled steel, the ships were pulled apart, leaving unanswered a question that was on the minds of many mariners: How the hell did it happen? <P>
	At the time of the collision, 12:10 a.m. the night of July 1st., the 514-foot freighter Enif was outbound in the channel while the Alexia (carrying no cargo) was proceeding inbound. The weather was fair, the seas calm, and by all accounts both vessels were operating within normal limits.  In the absense of comment from either of the ship's masters (who were constrained from so doing for insurance reasons) or the Coast Guard, which at this writing has not released the official results of its investigation, observers were only able to surmise from the photo of the two conjoined ships that the Enif appeared to have the right of way. <P>
	Unofficially, however, a source close to the investigation, predicted that the findings will show that both ships shared responsibility. "It's obvious from the angle in the photos that one of the ships had the right of way. But this was one of those classic situations that happens during a watch relief - the mid-watch was just coming on as the situation was developing. What's so odd is that if either vessel had, independent of the other, done any one of three or four things, it would have been just another nice day at sea." <P>

<HR>
<H2>New (and grim) forecast
makes it all but official:<BR>

global warming is here</H2></CENTER>
	A draft report on climactic change made public in September by a panel of experts working under United Nations auspesis, concludes that, in fact, global warming is occurring. While some of the effects of a changing climate may be beneficial, such as more rain in agricultural regions that can use it, the overall picture is one of widespread disruption and dislocation. The draft study, described by science writer William Stevens in in the New York Times, argues that possibly dire consequences could result during the next century. <P>
	For the past five years the Intergovernmental Panel on Climactic Change, created as a result of a 1992 U.N. treaty, has been assessing data and studies to develop a long range climactic forecast.  In so doing the scientists say they are 90-to 95% convinced that the chief cause of the developing changes is the emission of greenhouse gases. While agreeing that human activity (notably burning wood and fossil fuels) is at least partially responsible, the panel said it was not yet possible to determine how much of that is man-made and how much due to natural causes. <P>
	Among some of the experts' predictions: The average sea level world-wide will rise more than 18 inches by 2100, rendering uninhabitable many heavily populated river delta regions, including entire cities, mostly in Asia. The result will be a new class of disaster victim: environmental refugees.  On the U.S. eastern seaboard, beaches that are already disappearing at the rate of 2-3 feet a year, will be gone in 25 years. Elsewhere in the US will be an increase in droughts, more heat waves, and more forest fires and floods in other regions. Worldwide, mountain glaciers will undergo a retreat the studied characterized as "striking," with most glacial-fed rivers and streams experiencing significently diminished summer flows. There will be more rain world-wide, but deserts will expand and continential heartlands will become drier. <P>
	While the forecast is disturbing, some observers regard the arrival of the five-year study itself as a hopeful sign, for the report goes a long way toward articulating an irrfutable argument that could form the basis for concerted international cooperation to forestall a global environmental emergency. <P>

<H2>Phantom ships: piracy's
newest twist in Asia</H2></CENTER>
    According to the Commercial Crime Services Division of the International Chamber of Commerce, based in Britain,the traditional form of piracy, in which raiders board vessels on the high seas to plunder their cargo, is on the decline worldwide. While the figures are subject to seasonal variations, in part due to the vaguaries of weather, the 1994 total number of incidents was under 100 worldwide, compared with about 150 in 1993.  The 1995 totals are expected to reflect this continuing trend. However, a new form of highjacking is emerging. Operators of phantom ships, so called because they sail under carefully faked documents, are stealing upwards of $200 million in cargo every year from East Asian docks and taking it to other ports to be sold to customers who are either unaware the goods were stolen or unlikely to question the shipment's origin or ownership. <P>
    According to the International Maritime Bureau, which has investigated 20 phantom ships in recent years, the problem has become a serious headache for insurance carriers. Typically, the vessels are registered in Panama or Honduras and operated by groups of Chinese working out of Hong Kong, Taipei, Bangkok, and Singapore. They are very familiar with documentation and shipping and usually target generic cargos that can be easily sold: wire cable, timber, minerals. <P>
    At this juncture law enforcement agencies have urged the countries under whose flags these phantom ships sail to yank the vessels' registraton, but so far none have. In the meantime, no other strategies to combat the menace have been devised. <P>

<CENTER><H2>Father, teen son die in
scuba diving accident</H2></CENTER>
	A nationally known scuba diver and his teen-age son died and three other divers required decompression treatment when things went tragically wrong during a shipwreck dive July 2 six miles off San Pedro, California. Found in 145 feet of water by rescue divers from Baywatch and Marina Del Rey Harbor Patrols were the bodies of Darren Douglass, 34, of Glendora, California and his 14-year old son Jeremiah, both of whom had run out of air. Word of the deaths stunned the southern California scuba diving community where Douglass, the father of five, was well known as the managing editor of Dive Boat magazine and a master diving instructor with 20 years of experience. Douglass was also the dive master of the diving vessel Atlantis that had been chartered that day. It was two weeks before a preliminary report of the accident outlined the dramatic events that lead up to the tragedy. <P>
	Douglass had led 12 divers, including his son, to one of the coast's popular advanced dive spots, the sunken World War I Navy destroyer Moody that lies in kelp and sand 145 feet deep six miles off Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro. Given its depth (and therefore the increased risks) the wreck qualifies as a technical dive, with a safe bottom time of only 10-12 minutes.  It was 2 p.m. and the group had made a number of successful dives that day. Since most had used up their bottom time, they prepared to leave. Then things began to go wrong. <P>
	When the Atlantis' captain announced the anchor line had snagged on the wreck and he was prepared to cut it, a majority of the divers, including Douglass and his son, opted to do a quick bounce dive to free the anchor. They swam down the anchor line to free the snag. Darren Douglas began his ascent just before the anchor was freed, and the other divers followed. But, the report states, "the freed anchor line, in the strong current, now presented a difficult, meandering and indirect route for the divers," one of whom was young Douglass who was holding on to it in an attempt to follow it to the surface. A source familiar with the investigation said the boy was wearing only a single air tank instead of two recommended for such dives. <P>
	On his way up to the boat, diver Jeff Highley,32, saw Jeremiah give the out-of-air sign, and swam to him to share his back-up air supply. But the boy, who also seemed to be having buoyancy problems, was unable to overcome the downward force (a Coast Guard source said rescuers noted a small hole in his wetsuit which at that depth could have allowed in a good deal of water). Douglass let go of the anchor line and the back-up regulator and sank. Highley, also virtually out of air, floated to the surface unconscious where the Atlantis' crew quickly brought him aboard and managed to revive him (a Coast Guard helicoptor later medevaced Highley to a hyperbaric chamber on Santa Catalina Island where he was in serious but stable condition). <P>
	When Darren Douglass surface shortly thereafter and realized to his horror that his son had still not appeared, he apparently took the biggest gamble of all and dove beneath the surface. With only 200 psi of air left, he was last seen swimming rapidly down the anchor line to search for his child. He  paid the ultimate price. Los Angeles County Lifeguard Capt. Gary Crum who was one of the rescuers called to the scene told the Los Angeles Times that rescue divers found father and son floating side by side on the sandy bottom, the father's hand outstretched toward the son. "It looked like they were probably touching until the time they passed out and died." <P>

This 17-foot female great white shark weighing 4,000 lbs. became entangled in swordfish nets in southern <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="shark.gif" ALT="[photo of shark]">California waters September 21, 1994 and died before fishermen were able to set it free. Joe Caruso, skipper of the 42-foot F/V Horizon, had set the float net on a  Saturday evening in waters 15 miles west of Santa Monica Bay. When he and his deck hand Loc Huynh checked the net early Sunday morning, they were astonished. <P>
	"We thought we were pulling up a huge swordfish," Caruso told the Press-Telegram of Long Beach." Sadly, despite the fishermen's nearly day-long effort to free their catch, the huge fish died. Caruso then towed the fish back to port, docking Sunday evening at Long Beach's Terminal Island. <P>
	Mike Schaadt of the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium and one of the researchers who examined the fish reported the specimen was one of the largest ever seen in local waters. Researchers dissecting the creature found in the shark's stomach a 300 lb. sea lion and a 4-foot-long six-gilled shark. Parts of the shark were taken for delivery to shark experts while the liver, which weighed 1,086 lbs. was destined for pet food. <P>
	Skipper Caruso told the Press-Telegram that while they were out on the fishing grounds trying to free the shark, the sea lions in the area appeared to be thrilled by the sight of the dying fish tangled in the nets . "They were very excited and started making love to either other, kissing and whatever," he said. [Photo by  Branimir Kvartuc] <BR>

<B>Chip log -</B> A block of wood tied to a length of line and used in the earliest days of sail to measure speed and distance traveled. The chip log was dropped off the stern and the line, which was knotted at  regular intervals, was allowed to pay out. A sand glass was used to time the amount of knots run out (hence the term knots). The information was recorded into the vessel's logbook. Hence the origin of the verb "to log," and, most recently the computer term "to log on."<!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->

Scientists writing in the British journal Nature reported that the deep submersible Alvin, while exploring deep sea hydrothermal vents at a depth of 8,000 feet along a volcanic ridge in the Eastern Pacific, 500 miles west of Central America, videotaped two large octopi engaged in copulatory behavior. Subsequent study of the tape revealed that the critters were not only of different species but that both were male. One observer commented: 'Well, it is very dark down there.<!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->

<B>Chemical-laden tanker's hair-raising close call at the Golden Gate</B></CENTER><P>
	The Liberian-flagged Mundogas Europe, a 561-foot gas tanker loaded with deadly liquefied anhydrous ammonia missed colliding with the Golden Gate Bridge by the narrowest of margins the night of March 12 after losing steering. The Coast Guard later commended Captain Don <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="moondoggymap.gif" ALT="[map]">Hughes, a  veteran bar pilot, for skillfully maneuvering the vessel into a forced180-degree turn and avoiding what could have been a catastrophic maritime disaster with great loss of life. <P><!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->

<HR>
<BR>

	 When Captain Hughes boarded the inbound ship (a regular visitor to San Francisco dubbed as "MoonDoggie" by waterfront regulars) from the pilot boat eight miles west of the Gate at about 2100 on a stormy winter night, weather and sea conditions were troublesome: intermittent rain, wind gusting from the south, a flood tide, and a ground swell producing six to eight foot surf.  At 2110 the Mundogas Europe was just outside the bridge in the eastbound traffic lane on a course of 060 at 14 knots when Hughes noticed the ship's head drifting to starboard. <P>
	"I said to the Captain, 'Hey, we're going starboard,'" Hughes recalled. "And he answered 'Oh, I gotta keep an eye on my...' That's when we lost steering - with the rudder stuck at ten degrees starboard. It went out at the worst place it could have gone out. We were headed right for the pier of the bridge's south tower." <P>
	During the desperate 14 minutes that followed, Captain Hughes drew upon a thorough mastery of ship-handling in tight quarters gained from 22 years as a bay and river pilot to force the Mundogas into a hard turn to starboard. "I told him to stop engines and give me reverse as soon as you can." Hughes also alerted VTS (Vessel Traffic Service), requesting tugs. But the nearest tug was 30 minutes away. <P>
	"My hats off to Chevron. One of their ships was coming in and they had a tug and when they heard me ask for help, their ship immediately released the tug to come to my aid while they dropped anchor and waited. I was in extremis." <P>
	With the tanker heading straight for the South Tower and the rocks at Fort Point,  Hughes ordered the port anchor put down with six shots of chain (a shot equals 90 feet). With the depth beneath the bridge at 300 feet, agonizing seconds passed while waiting for the anchor to strike bottom and drag.  The pilot asked for sea speed astern as soon as possible. <P>
	Greg Waugh, president of the San Francisco Bar Pilots Association, later said Hughes confided his first thought was that he was going to die and probably take a lot of people with him. Indeed, had the pressurized gas tanks ruptured, 36 million pounds of anhydrous ammonia mixed with sea water would have produced a poisonous gas with lethal consequences to ship's company and untold numbers of citizens ashore. <P>
	"As the anchor began to fetch up under us, we missed the bridge pier but now we were heading for the Fort Point rocks," Hughes continued. "I thought 'We're goners. There's no way it's gonna turn that fast.' Then we started coming around a bit more to starboard, then little more. When an anchor goes down and under the hull, you have more leverage than if you're pulling from the top. I said, 'Maybe we'll make it captain.'" <P>
	 With the engines now backing in full reverse, the ship was beginning to slow as well.  Still, the flood tide continued to set the tanker ever closer to Fort Point. "But because we're backing down, we're sitting in the water. We were staring to sit sideways over on to Fort Point. So I said 'Captain, stop your engines and come ahead half.' <P>
	"He said, 'No, no, you'll break my anchor chain!'  I  said 'Better to break your anchor than break your ship." By now Mundogas Europe was wallowing in a beam sea as eight-foot ground swells pushed her toward the rocks. "We were rolling in that surf. I could hear it breaking. And I figured with our thirty-one foot draft, we would hit something at any second. But by going ahead half and keeping a strain on the anchor, I was able to drag her where I wanted to." <P>
	With the flood tide pushing the stern around, and the ship's engineering crew able to manually put the rudder hard to starboard, the vessel continued turning, coming within less than a ship length of the rocks before moving slowly away into deeper water.  Said Hughes: "It was a real monkey wrench turn - my nuts tightened." <P>
	Moments later the Mundogas Europe was well away, safely in deep water off China Beach, heading due West, her bow now facing just outside of Mile Rocks. Hughes dropped another shot in the water and the ship held. Hughes then ordered the starboard anchor dropped. Due to combination wind from the southwest, the easterly flood tidal current, and a slight westerly push from a near shore tidal eddy, the Mundogas Europe ended up facing at a south-southwesterly heading. the By the time four tugs arrived, the Mundogas Europe was safely anchored. They later helped move the tanker into the anchorage area inside the bay between Alameda Naval Air Station and Hunter's Point. <P>
	In the aftermath some critics of tanker safety regulations renewed their call for requiring tankers carrying anhydrous ammonia and other hazardous chemicals to have escort tugs when entering harbors. Currently only ships carrying natural gas are required to do so. Proposed regulations are being considered to require escorts for tankers carrying oil and related petrochemical cargoes. <P>
	What was not in dispute was the quiet heroism of a quick-thinking pilot on a stormy night outside the Golden Gate. <P>
	"Captain Hughes acted quickly and did everything right," said the Bar Pilot's Waugh. "There's no question what he did saved that ship and a great many lives." <P>

<B>Of lost soles, drifting duckies and other spills of opportunity</B></CENTER> <P>
	On May 27, 1990 the freighter Hansa Carrier, enroute from Korea to the U.S., encountered a severe North Pacific storm. Spilled overboard from cargo containers were 61,000 Nike shoes. The incident was nearly forgotten until a year later when a Seattle newspaper reported incredulous beachcombers along the Oregon, Washington, and Canadian <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="duckiesmap.gif"ALT="[map]">coasts finding thousands of Nike shoes washing ashore. While Nike declined to take official notice of the discovery, the news attracted the attention of two oceanographers. <!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->
<HR>

<HR>

	"We saw this as a wonderful spill of opportunity," says Curt Ebbesmeyer, an oceanographer with the consulting firm of Evans-Hamilton, Inc. in Seattle, Washington. Ebbesmeyer and a colleague, James Ingraham of the National Marine Fisheries Service, reasoned if they collected enough documentation concerning the location and number of shoes found, the data could be used to hindcast the shoes' drift in much the same manner as is done with drift bottles periodically released in the mid-Pacific to track current patterns. <P>
	The oceanographers were helped considerably by media interest and by Oregon artist Steve McLeod, an avid beachcomber who traveled the coast and provided the scientists with the phone numbers of other beachcombers. Ebbesmeyer and Ingraham used only reports involving about 100 or more shoes, in time accumulating reports involving 1,600 "floaties," amounting to 2.6% of the total lost, a rate equal to the recovery rate for drift bottle drops which are usually released in groups of only 500-1,000. <P>
	Using a computer program called the Ocean Surface Current Simulations (OSCURS) , the oceanographers produced a hindcast drift simulation that  predicted the first shoes would reach Vancouver Island 220 days after the spill, a result that agreed quite closely with the date of the first reported sole survivors there. <P>
	As for the significant latitudinal distribution of the drifting shoes (about 300 kilometers), the oceanographers surmise that many winter-time arrivals may have been carried northward by the Davidson Current while others, arriving in the spring, encountered southerly moving currents, notably the California current which would eventually carry surviving soles westward back across the Pacific. <P>
	Indeed, as the scientists were preparing to publish their findings in the American Geophysical Union's publication EOS, they received reports of Nikes being found on the north end of the Big Island of Hawaii. The news was not unexpected. <P>
	"If any shoes survive long enough they could complete an entire Pacific circulation, about five to seven years," Ebbesmeyer explains. "Right now [fall, 1995], the hot spots are the Philippines and all of Japan. And some of the shoes should be coming back to Washington and Oregon soon." <P>
	Lost Nikes, are not the only drifters the oceanographers are continuing to track. In November,1992, when hundreds of 5- to 12-cm plastic bathtub toy animals (yellow ducks, blue turtles, red beavers and green frogs) began appearing on the beaches near Sitka, Alaska, the oceanographers again went into action, publishing notices in local papers and gathering reports of about 400 recoveries along approximately 850 km of the eastern Gulf of Alaska shore. This time, however, determining the origin of the toy spill proved a daunting task, for the owners of the cargo ship were anxious to avoid publicity. <P>
	"We spent months tracking down the ship's owners, talking to lawyers and executives, telling them we just wanted to know what the ocean was doing," Ebbesmeyer explains. The vessel's owners finally <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="nikeduckies.gif" ALT="[Nikes and duckies]">relented and, in exchange for anonymity, provided details concerning the loss of 29,000 toys from a container vessel, enroute from Hong Kong to Tacoma, Washington, that had encountered a severe winter storm January 10, 1992.<!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->

<HR>

	Because the plastic toys are highly susceptible to surface winds (in contrast to the low-windage Nikes which float upside down, Ingraham and Ebbesmeyer had to integrate into the computer model the function of daily wind speed and direction provided by the Navy's Fleet Numerical Oceanography Center. From the resulting daily current vector fields they interpolated the trajectory of the toys. <P>
	The resulting calculation showed that the toys passed the point of the Nike shoe spill, then veered northward to begin traveling counterclockwise around the Gulf of Alaska gyre, then north through the Unimak Pass into the Bering Sea where, in the fall of 1994, they became entrapped and frozen in the transpolar drift which conveys ice over the North Pole at the rate of eight kilometers a day. <P>
	Eventually (as early as 1999) this ducky flotilla will debouche in the North Atlantic where it will be picked up by the eastward moving Gulf Stream. The toys will then bob their way onto the beaches of the British Isles, more than 15,000 kilometers from the start of their ocean peregrinations. <P>
	Drs. Ebbesmeyer and Ingraham agree that, given the very large release of 29,000 toys which are strong and highly resilient, they anticipate that by the turn of the century a few toys will have been transported to many locales in the oceans of the Northern Hemisphere. The two scientists invite Marine Watch readers to contact them with reports of any future finds of Nike shoes, bathtub toys, or other interesting drifting objects. <!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->

<STRONG>The true story of a woman's survival at Sea</STRONG><BR>

Deborah Scaling Kiley & Meg Noonan;<BR>

Houghton Mifflin Co.  Hardbound, 210 pp.<BR>

Audio edition (abridged) narrated by Karen Allen,<BR>

two-cassettes, Bantam Doubleday Dell, $16.99</CENTER><P>
	On October 28, 1982, a Russian freighter rescued two people from a small inflatable dingy 170 miles east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Suffering from severe shock and exposure, the pair were the only survivors of a crew of five who escaped a yacht that sank during a hurricane five days earlier. For years afterward, one of them, Deborah Scaling Kiley, suffered from post-traumatic stress and a stormy personal life. Finally, in 1990, she began writing about her nightmare experience with the help of writer Meg Noonan. The result is <I>Albatross</I>, a powerful, candid first-person narrative told in an unadorned style that relies on the raw, often grisly, truth of events themselves to pull the reader deep into the vortex of a harrowing ordeal. For the book's audio edition, actress Karen Allen's hoarse, croaky voice provides a mix of dread and hope perfectly suited to the tale . <P>
	In September, 1982, Kiley, a member of that loose-knit community of adventurers addicted to blue water sailing, quit her waitress job in Bar Harbor, Maine to help deliver to Florida  the <I>Trashman</I>, a luxurious ketch-rigged 58-foot sailing yacht owned by a Texas dumpster magnate ("beautiful boat, weird name").  An expert sailor whose credits included Caribbean charters,  trans-Atlantic crossings, and a year's stint as the first American woman to sail in the prestigious (and grueling) Whitbread competition, Kiley anticipated an uneventful passage. But, in retrospect, warning signs were everywhere, starting with the boat's skipper John Lippoth, a lazy, indecisive, alcoholic mess of a man. Accompanying  him, against the owner's explicit orders (evidently the couple fought frequently), was Lippoth's off-and-on girlfriend Meg Mooney,  a pale leggy gin-voiced sophisticate "with perfect nails... and perfect smile," whose idea of sailing was "dock side parties, a way to get tan, and have some laughs." <P>
	As a yachtsman, Lippoth was immediately suspect: not only was the vessel's rigging in need of tuning, but frequently, at the first sign of rough weather, he would douse the jib and start the engine. By the time they reached Cape May, New Jersey, Kiley was more than passing angry at the man "for relying so heavily on machinery, for not having the balls to just sail the boat." <P>
	Days later, in Annapolis, Maryland,  Lippoth casually recruited two men for the rest of the passage:  Brad Cavanaugh, an easy-going muscular American in his early twenties whom Kiley knew slightly, and Mark Adams, a crude, sexist, belligerent  Brit who on the first meeting declares the boat a "pig" and women on boats "utterly useless."  Like the <I>Trashman's</I> captain, Adams, whose own poison was Dewar's scotch straight from the bottle,  soon revealed himself as a hopeless drunk. <P>
	It was this volatile company that set sail from Annapolis, out the Chesapeake Bay and east into the Gulf Stream and equally volatile weather. Thirty hours later the <I>Trashman</I> was well into the Stream where it was ambushed by an unpredicted hurricane: 71 knot winds, and 40 foot seas that pummeled the yacht, ripping the Dyer Dow dinghy from its stern davits. Following a long night of fear and exhaustion, Lippoth radioed the Coast Guard for help. Two hours later a Coast Guard search plane appeared overhead and circled reassuringly. The pilot advised that two ships were in the vicinity and would rendezvous. <P>
	They never did. Mysteriously, the Coast Guard later reported receiving a radio message that the <I>Trashman</I> had safely reached Wilmington, N.C. and called off the search. Given that Mark Adams was deliriously drunk and made several radio calls to the Coast Guard during the final hours, one suspects he may well have been the source of the fatal misinformation. On the <I>Trashman</I>, fear turned to terror as  a huge wave smashed through the port-side windows, flooding the interior. Within minutes, the boat sank, leaving captain and crew in the raging sea clinging for their lives to the sides of the <I>Trashman's</I> 11-foot long red Zodiac dinghy. Worse, Meg Mooney, naked except for a men's long-sleeved shirt, had sustained deep leg lacerations from being slammed against the rigging. Kiley herself had on only an old sweatshirt and a pair of nylon running shorts. <P>
	With high winds and waves making it impossible for the Zodiac to float upright without capsizing, the five spent most of the next 18 hours huddled underneath the overturned dinghy, clinging to its underside. Only the Gulf Stream's 70 degree-plus waters prevented hypothermia from more rapid onset. <P>
	When subsiding seas at last permitted the survivors to climb aboard, the descent into hell continued at an implacable, merciless pace. Long night followed day as they  drifted beneath gray, rainless skies, exhausted, without food or water, and shivering with cold.  Scores of large sharks appeared, circling, bumping, probing.  The bottom of the dingy was awash with urine, puss and excrement, the stench unendurable. Lippoth and Adams, both  showing signs of acute alcohol withdrawal, gradually drifted into dementia and began drinking sea water.  Bizarre acts of madness follow - and the sharks were waiting: <P>
	"In the darkness I could make out some turbulence in the water about ten feet off our port side.  Then we were hit again and I felt something under us, shimmying along the bottom. Another blow shoved us forward. We were being attacked by sharks. I knew I was going to die....I felt the rough skin scrape along the dinghy. The bow lifted up, then dropped back down. The dinghy spun around. I was paralyzed with terror...We were being battered from all sides...It was too much - the scraping skin, the blows, the frothing water, the screams..." <P>
	More than a compelling story of human endurance (and human failure), <I>Albatross</I> is an absolute must-read for any mariner, providing a textbook example of how <I>not</I> to go to sea. Kiley, for whom writing this book was a healing, later returned to sailing with gusto: "The wreck of the <I>Trashman</I> was the worst thing that ever happened to me. And it saved my life." <P>

	Marine Watch, a  journal about events occurring on, under, and over the oceans of the world, debuted this month with a mailing of complimentary first issue copies to selected individuals in the earth sciences, the maritime and commercial fishing industries, the Navy and Coast Guard, and to members of  the sailing, diving, and surfing communities. <P>
	Geared to an informed readership, the quarterly is initially 16-20 pages in size (with no advertising)  and features authoritative in-depth reporting about a wide range of events of interest to the ocean community.  Charter subscriptions are $30 for individuals, $50 for vessels, agencies, business and institutions. <P>
	"Marine Watch is intended  for an audience composed of two groups," explains John Grissim, the journal's editor and publisher.  "On the one hand are scientists, researchers, skilled specialists and scholars in government, academia, and the private sector whose work involves the marine world and the earth sciences.  And on the other are professional mariners, sailors, boaters, underwater archeologists, sport and commercial fishers, surfers, divers, treasure salvers, and blue water adventurers. Both have a lot to share with each other and both have in common a deep knowledge and appreciation of the marine world." <P>
	Grissim, who is producing Marine Watch from Point Reyes Station, California, on the coast an hour north of San Francisco, has spent three years preparing for the journal's launch, drawing upon his 27 years experience as a  journalist (and author of seven books).  A  longtime surfer, fisherman, diver and lover of the ocean, he has been a communications officer on a U.S. Navy fleet oiler (Pacific),  edited the Australian surfing magazine <I>Tracks</I>, was a member of the dive team that discovered and salvaged the $20 million Spanish treasure galleon Concepcion north of the Dominican Republic in 1978, and  has crewed on West Coast salmon and herring boats. He has contributed to a number of national magazines, including <I>National Fisherman, Omni,  Playboy, Rolling Stone, Smithsonian, Oceans, Surfing, </I>and<I> Surfer</I>,  mostly on subjects that have some bearing on marine science and technology and the sea. <P>
	He explains that one impetus for the venture was the lack of publications that feature substantive writing about the ocean for the ocean community.  "There are fine periodicals out there for sailors, scuba divers, the maritime industry, the marine sciences, fishermen,  weather forecasters, you name it, but oddly,  not a single periodical devoted to the ocean. Marine Watch intends to help fill that void." <P>
	Marine Watch will  report on marine related news from a wide spectrum of topics, ranging from shipwrecks, shark attacks, severe weather, sea floor exploration, oceanography, and treasure salvage, to blue water cruising, surf stories, ocean oddities, high tech undersea research, even accounts by credible witnesses of encounters with marine cryptids ("We will avoid the pejorative term 'sea monster while keeping an open mind").   Grissim adds the editorial philosophy will be, in general,  non-political. "We're concerned less with the lubberly disputes of shore folk than with accurate reporting of actual ocean events. But underlying much that will be reported will be an implicit deep concern for the environmental emergency that has begun to manifest in Earth's oceans." <P>
	Regardless of the topic, the writing is geared for readers with a high level of comprehension. "We don't expect every surfer or sailor to be conversant with Doppler hook echoes and Kelvin waves, nor every scientist to know what a backside layback stall is,  or a helium unscrambler, or the difference between a checkerboard and a trawl door, but Marine Watch won't shy away from the technical or the arcane. We figure our readers have the  expertise and marine experience to dope out what they need to know and prefer it that way." <P>
	Marine Watch will be in close touch with its readers, reporting news of their marine activities, sightings, and experiences. To facilitate this exchange, Grissim will  mount a Marine Watch home page on the Web by the end of January, 1996. <P>

<CENTER><H1>The five stage life cycle of a waterspout
</H1></CENTER>



<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="spoutgraphic.gif" ALT="[waterspout diagram]"><BR>




Technically an intense low pressure vortex column, fair-weather waterspouts most frequently develop on the sea surface and then move skyward, rather than dropping down from parent clouds like tornadoes.  Most are potentially lethal. Lasting from two to 20 minutes, they move at 10-15 knots, their intense vortices at maturity typically generating, however briefly, winds of hurricane force or greater. The funnels occur most frequently off the lee shores of continents in the tropics and sub-tropics such as Asia, Australia, and, notably, North America, particularly  the Florida Keys where heated, humid air creates strong convective currents. <P>
	Conditions are best when a high temperature lapse rate (i.e. a rapid decrease of temperature with elevation) prevails at the sea surface during the warmest part of the day (usually  around high noon or early 
afternoon) and the winds are light and variable, with an extremely weak vertical wind shear. This kind of environment thermodynamically can support strong updrafts. In the Florida Keys, due to the unique geomorphology of the region, waterspouts spawn most frequently in the late afternoon or early evening. <P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="graph.gif"ALT="[waterspout diagram]">
	Research has determined that waterspouts are the end product of  five interacting scales of motion (ranging from the synoptic scale to the microscale), that produce a cascade of energy. When a patch of air just above the sea surface becomes heated and rises, the resulting pressure differential causes the surrounding, slightly cooler, air to spiral inward, forming an eddy, much as a land-born dust devil.  Over warm water, however,  the abundant water vapor at the sea surface adds to the latent heat of condensation. And because water vapor is lighter than dry air, the steep water vapor gradient that is present helps carry the original spiraling eddy skyward. Though a parent cloud need not be directly overhead, there is always a cloud system or cloud mass nearby (usually cumulus congestus), coupled with strong convective air currents that frequently produce a  downward moving funnel. <P>
	From this point on, NOAA's Dr. Joseph Golden distinguishes five stages of waterspout formation: <P>
<UL><B>1. Dark spot</B>. A prominent circular, light-colored disk appears on the surface, surrounded by a larger dark area of indeterminate  shape and with diffused edges.  While not visible to the mariner at sea level, the presence of a dark spot and an associated  funnel cloud overhead indicate that a complete funnel  is present. <P>
<B>2. Spiral pattern.</B>  A pattern of light and dark-colored surface bands spiraling out from the dark spot develops. <P>
<B>3. Spray ring.</B>  A dense swirling annulus (ring) of sea spray, called a cascade, appears around the dark spot with what appears to be an eye similar to that seen in hurricanes. <P>
<B>4. Mature vortex</B>. The waterspout, now visible from sea surface to the overhead cloud mass, achieves maximum organization and intensity. Its funnel often appears hollow, with a surrounding shell of turbulent condensate. The spray vortex can rise to a height of several hundred feet or more and often creates a visible wake and an associated wave train as it moves. <P>
<B>5. Decay.</B>  The funnel and spray vortex begin to dissipate as the inflow of warm air into the vortex weakens. Frequently, rain showers that develop nearby (caused by the thermal updraft) create a down draft (or leading edge gust-front) of cooler air that accelerates the waterspout's decay. Ship masters whose vessels have been hit by waterspouts during the decay phase have reported being drenched with a combination of salt water and rain water.</UL> <P>

Note: In October Dr. Golden, and co-author Carin Goodall-Gosnell, the Science <P>
Operations Officer at the NWS's new office in Newport, NC. will deliver a research paper on the Cherry Point waterspout at the American Meteorological Society's  Conference on Radar Meteorology, in Vail, Colorado. <P>

<HR><H2>NEXRAD:</H2><H3> ---probably the most advanced hydrometeorological warning and forecast system in the world.</H3><P>
	The hardware keystone of the National Weather Service's major modernization, the Doppler weather surveillance radar (Model WSR-88D) is responsible for a quantum leap in weather forecasting capability.  Nicknamed NEXRAD (for Next Generation Weather Radar), the system is built around a refined radar so sensitive it can detect and identify wind-driven hail, rain, insects, and even dust, then apply Doppler technology to determine data on the speed, direction and movement of shifting winds. As much a signal processor as a radar, NEXRAD has tremendous computing power to analyze and manipulate incoming data. <P>
	"We're now seeing existing complex phenomena in clear air we never before knew were there." says NOAA's Joeph Golden.  "Micro-cold fronts, all sorts of discontinuities. We can now track dust fronts in front of thunderstorms very well." <P>
	Using special computer processing, NEXRAD can  provide unprecedented views of a storm's internal wind movements, identifying, for example, an abrupt shift in wind direction - a hook echo - that marks the mesocyclonic circulation  that accompanies tornado formation.  By viewing the storm system at different elevations in the vertical column above the hook echo (much like a CAT scan)   forecasters are able to detect additional strong inbound-outbound "wind couplets" (AKA  velocity couplets)  to confirm tornado formation - and issue emergency warnings 20 to 30 minutes before a tornadic episode. Similarly,  NEXRAD can detect at the cloud base and above wind movements associated with vortical weather events such as tornadic waterspouts. <P>
	With its associated UNISYS work station, two 19" full color high-resolution displays, dedicated software, and continual upgrades,  NEXRAD is a forecasters dream, able to show, among many displays, hourly rainfall amounts,  wind profiles in the form of velocity and azimuth,  mean radial velocity of vortical storms, and predicted  storm movement at 15 minute intervals. <P>
	The NWS intends to have about 120 NEXRADS deployed through the US and its territories by the end of 1996. Dr. Golden hopes the activation of a NEXRAD system in Key West, Florida will enable him to develop Doppler velocity data, especially from low-level scans of developing waterspouts. <P>

Note: In October Dr. Golden, and co-author Carin Goodall-Gosnell, the Science <P>
Operations Officer at the NWS's new office in Newport, NC. will deliver a research paper on the Cherry Point waterspout at the American Meteorological Society's  Conference on Radar Meteorology, in Vail, Colorado. <P><CENTER><A HREF="spout.html">Back to Severe Weather<P>

and facilitating body to augment the efforts to attract professional
<a href=franchises.html>sports franchises</a>
and
<a href=accomplishments.html>major sports events</a>
of the
<a href=venues.html>variety of venues</a>
in the
<a href=profile.html>Sacramento region</a>. An example of our efforts
would be the recent
<a href=rbis.html>Regional Ballpark in Sacramento (RBIS)</a>

<h1>ARCO Arena</h1>

<a href=images/arco_arena.jpg>
<img align=right src=images/arco_arena.gif></a>
ARCO Arena was dedicated in November 1988 as the new home of the Sacramento
Kings of the National Basketball Association for a cost of $40 million dollars.
The facility was built and is operated without any taxpayer dollars.

<p>

Since its opening in 1988, the Kings have sold out every game, and now hold
the NBA's longest consecutive sell-out streak.

<p>

Conveniently located near the intersections of Interstate 5 and Interstate 80,
ARCO Arena is only five minutes from downtown Sacramento and 90 miles from
either the San Francisco Bay Area or Reno/Lake Tahoe.

<font size="-1"><b>Arena configured for boxing</b></font></table>

ARCO Arena was designed with a unique configuration for unparalleled sight
lines to watch basketball. The 442,000 square foot facility features such
amenities as 30 luxury suites, a state-of-the-art Panasonic AstroVision video
display system that stands three stories high and an audio system that boasts
over 300 speakers.

<p>

An average of 1.7 million spectators annually attend events at ARCO which hosts
nearly 200 events per year varying from concerts, NHL Hockey, Arena Football,
Indoor Soccer, professional tennis and the Ringley Bros and Barnum &amp; Bailey
Circus.

The facility employs nearly 1,200 full-time and part-time workers during the
basketball season. ARCO is built on 105 acres featuring up to 12,000 parking
spaces in a fully lighted parking lot. Among the indoor amenities are 14
concession stands with 100 cash registers, two lounges overlooking the arena
interior; eight locker rooms; 297 public toilets; and 24 hour security.

<title>Sacramento Sports Commission RBIS Q&amp;A</title>

<img align=right src="images/rbis_logo.gif">
<center><h2>Questions and Answers</h2></center>

<h3>Why a ballpark and not a stadium?</h3>

Baseball teams are moving back to downtowns all across the country. Fans are
taking mass transit to get there, or parking in the existing lots built for
daytime office commuters. The new ballparks are smaller (covering about 15
acres), more comfortable, and built to bring the fan closer to the game. As a
result, many baseball teams are finding that they don't fit as well in those
giant suburban stadiums that are also designed for football. Instead, the
trend is toward new ballparks that are actually downtown entertainment
mega-complexes that include restaurants, bars and other attractions.

<h3>Why the focus on a downtown site?</h3>

Downtown is a regional center. It has the best transit connections with light
rail and Amtrak, and there is more than adequate parking already constructed
for office workers and downtown commuters. Downtown freeway connections are
also designed for twice the number of commuters that it takes to fill a
ballpark. These same highway off-ramps will be improved and expanded as part
of the Southern Pacific/Richards Boulevard plan.
<a href=arco_arena.html>The Arco site</a>,
now owned by the City, was designed as a multi-use stadium. King's owner Jim
Thomas, who is working on a plan to develop that parcel as a
sports-entertainment complex for the City, has always encouraged the City to
look for a downtown site for a ballpark.

<h3>What about the contamination at the SP yards?</h3>

SP has today 37 acres of completely clean land that could accommodate the 15
acres that a ballpark needs. But there are several other locations that might
be suitable for a ballpark. For example, the City of Sacramento also owns
property near the Sacramento River water treatment plan that could be used
(with a small parcel of adjoining land) for a downtown stadium.

<h3>Why did we get legislative approval and not form a JPA?</h3>

On July 19th Governor Pete Wilson signed SB 441, authored by Senator Pat
Johnston, into law thus creating the Sacramento Ballpark Authority. Some have
wondered why we did this when legislative approval was not necessary. A Joint
Powers Authority (JPA), a voluntary organization between local governments,
could have been formed to construct a ballpark. Unlike members of a JPA the
Sacramento Ballpark Authority is prevented from going to the public treasury
for funds to build the ballpark. SB 441 specifically prohibits the newly
formed Sacramento Ballpark Authority from creating a new tax or raising
existing taxes. This forced fiscal restraint will help Sacramento in
negotiations with perspective teams

<h3>How much will a ballpark cost and who will pay?</h3>

City staff has conducted extensive research on ballpark, arena and stadium
construction. Costs range from $160 to $250 million. Ballparks are built now,
financed by loans and bonds based on future revenues. While ballparks, arenas
and stadiums are not always big money makers, they do generate income from a
variety of sources, including: naming rights (횎oors field in Colorado and
Arco Arena in Sacramento), selling leases on skyboxes, gate receipts, TV and
cable broadcast rights, parking fees, special events and concessions.

<p>

Each ballpark and team has a different set of arrangements. Some teams require
revenues from one or more of these same sources to cover operating costs.
Other teams have contributed cash to stadium construction in return for a
greater share of revenues. There are as many different financing plans as
there are ballparks and stadiums. Currently, there are 32 stadiums, arenas
and ballparks under construction in the US, 13 of them privately financed.

<p>

The eventual cost of a baseball facility can't be locked down until the
ballpark authority has completed three key tasks: gaining control of the land
where the ballpark will be located, negotiating agreements with a team to play
in the ballpark, and jointly designing the ballpark with that team. Currently,
we can look at what other communities have done, and we know that it is
possible, however challenging, to construct a stadium without new taxes.

<h3>If we built it, will they come?</h3>

The City of St. Petersburg built a stadium costing $135 million that has been
empty for years. Instead, the Sacramento Ballpark Authority will work to
ensure that everything is ready to go, so when a team becomes available we are
ready to break ground on our new ballpark.

<h3>Why the rush?</h3>

Actually, both the City and the County of Sacramento have been working on a
sports policy for more than a year. The idea for a ballpark is a consequence
of that planning. It may be several years before a team shows interest in
Sacramento. The process resembles a marathon rather than a sprint. Still, if
an opportunity to gain a major league baseball franchise appears soon, we want
to be ready.

<h3>What can fans do to help support a ballpark and efforts to bring major league baseball to Sacramento?</h3>

<a href=rbis_membership.html>Join Regional Ballpark in Sacramento (RBIS)</a>,
a new organization formed to support a downtown ballpark in Sacramento. RBIS is
a partnership between fans, community leaders, the
<a href="http://www.sacsports.com/">Sacramento Sports Commission</a>,
and the
<a href="http://www.metrochamber.org/">Sacramento Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce</a>.

Sacramento has enjoyed a great history of baseball dating back to as early as
1886. The first team was known as the "Sacramento Atlas" and played in the
California League. During the early 1900's the name was changed to the
"Wolves" and later to the "Buffalos". From 1918 to 1935 the team adopted the
name of "Senators" which was later shortened to "Solons", a synonym for the
word Senators in 1936. From 1936 to 1960 the Solons played at Edmonds Field
located in downtown Sacramento at Riverside Blvd. and Broadway near the Tower
Theater. Thousands of Sacramento baseball fans came out to the ballpark to
cheer on their Solons and enjoy a great game of baseball. <i>(Photo courtesy of

<a href=images/rbis3.jpg><img align=right src="images/rbis3.gif"></a>
The original Edmonds Field was a wood structure as shown here in 1948. It was
first constructed in 1922 and was known as Moreing Field after the teams owner,
Lew Moreing. The stadium changed names three times before being called Edmonds
Field in 1945. Dick Edmonds was the Sacramento Union's sports editor and was
instrumental in helping keep the Solons in Sacramento. In 1944 he persuaded a
local business group to buy the team from the St. Louis Cardinals, who wanted
to move them to Tacoma. On July 18th, 1948 a fire destroyed the stadium. In
less than a year the stadium was rebuilt, this time with concrete and was ready
for the home opener in 1949. <i>(Photo courtesy of the Sacramento Bee)</i>

The Sacramento Senators played in the Pacific Coast League from 1918 to 1935. 
Their name changed to the Solons in 1936 and they continued to play at Edmonds
Field until 1960.  A new Solons team moved from Eugene, Oregon and played in
Sacramento from 1974 to 1976 at Hughes Stadium. <i>(Photo courtesy of McCurry)</i>

<h2>SBA Origin</h2>

The Sacramento Ballpark Authority (SBA) was established as a legal entity
on July 19th, 1996 when Governor Pete Wilson signed SB 441 by Senator Patrick
Johnston. The bill charges the authority with the responsibility for
developing a baseball-only ballpark in Sacramento by issuing revenue bonds to
raise the capital. The SBA may be comprised of representatives of the City and
County of Sacramento and the Counties of Yolo, El Dorado, Placer and San
Joaquin.

<p>

The SBA legislation enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support in both houses of
the Legislature and has received the enthusiastic endorsement from numerous
local elected officials. The support in the regional business community is
solid and mushrooming as the education process gains momentum. The core
support that now exists must be built upon through education and awareness,
especially in the counties surrounding Sacramento.

<h2>RBIS Origin</h2>

To facilitate the education process, the group Regional Ballpark in
Sacramento (RBIS) has been formed. The organization is a collaboration of many
groups and individuals who favor building a major league ballpark in
Sacramento. The goal of RBIS is to help bring major league baseball to
Sacramento and to lobby for a major league ballpark, preferably in downtown. 
RBIS must learn how other communities have developed ballparks and pass on
that knowledge to others in the region. RBIS will focus on generating the
grassroots support necessary for the construction of a ballpark.
The
<a href="http://www.sacsports.com/">Sacramento Sports Commission</a>
and the
<a href="http://www.metrochamber.org/">Sacramento Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce</a>
have partnered to get RBIS established.

<p>

The entire project may take years to complete, for that reason, Sacramento
<a href="http://www.sacto.org/mayor.html">Mayor Joe Serna, Jr.</a>
and others refer to RBIS task as a marathon not a sprint.

<HR><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.comptia.org/!alogo3.gif"></CENTER>
<CENTER><H1>What Is A+ Certification?</H1></CENTER>
<BR>
<P> A+ Certification is a testing program sponsored by the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) 
that certifies the competency of service technicians in the computer industry.  Anyone who wants a nationally-
recognized credential as a competent computer service professional can take the A+ exams.  The program is backed by 
major computer hardware and software vendors, distributors, resellers and publications, as well as a leading industry 
service organization, the Association of Field Service Management, Inc. The test, which is administered by Drake 
Prometric (Bloomington, MN), was first available in July 1993, with periodic updates since then. <P>
<BR>
<P>Earning A+ certification means that you possess the knowledge, skills, and customer relations skills essential for a 
successful computer service technician, as defined by experts from companies across the industry.  The exams cover a 
broad range of hardware and software technologies, but are not related to any vendor-specific products.  More than 40 
organizations have contributed time and budget resources to develop the A+ computer-based tests.</P><BR>
<P>To become certified, you must pass two test modules  the Core and one of two other specialties, either the Microsoft 
Windows/DOS module or the Macintosh module. When candidates pass the Core plus a specialty, they receive a 
certificate that mentions the specialty module they passed, such as</P>

<MENU>
<BR><LI>A+ Certification Exam with a specialty in Microsoft Windows/DOS environments
<BR><LI>A+ Certification Exam with a specialty in Macintosh OS-based Computers
<BR></MENU><BR>
Individuals who were already A+ certified when the enhanced exams 'went live' in April 1995 need not retake the test 
to remain A+ certified. Candidates for certification may register by phone by calling 1-800-77-MICRO (1-800-776-4276) and schedule 
their testing session at a Drake Authorized Testing Center, in any of the 50 states nationwide, and in 150+ other 
countries worldwide.  Candidates who pass the two computer-based test modules become certified, demonstrating 
basic knowledge of configuring, installing, diagnosing, repairing, upgrading, and maintaining microcomputers and 
associated technologies.<BR><HR>
<CENTER><H2>Why Certification is Important</H2></CENTER>
<BR>
Individual service technicians gain valuable benefits from becoming A+ certified, including:

<BR><MENU>
<BR><LI>Recognized proof of professional achievement:  The A+ credential validates that the holder has reached a level of 
competence commonly accepted and valued by the industry.
<BR><LI>Enhanced job opportunities:   Many employers give preference in hiring applicants with A+ Certification.  Some 
employers may require A+ as a condition of employment. They view A+ as proof that a new hire knows the 
procedures and technologies required to be a successful computer service technician.
<BR><LI>Opportunity for advancement:   The A+ credential can be a plus when an employer awards job advancements and 
promotions.
<BR><LI>Training requirement:  A+ Certification may be required as a pre-requisite to attending a vendor's training course, so employers will offer advanced training to 
those employees who are already A+ Certified.
<BR><LI>Customer confidence:  As the general public learns about A+, customers will require that only certified technicians be 
assigned to their accounts.  The technician then arrives at a client site already known as a competent computer service 
professional. The industry also gains benefits from the widespread acceptance of the A+ credential, including:
<BR><LI>Lower training costs:  Resellers and other employers of service technicians can save money and increase productive 
work-time when vendors eliminate redundant, time-consuming base-level training and instead require A+ Certification 
as a pre-requisite.
<BR><LI>Customer satisfaction:  When employees have a credential that proves their competency, customer expectations are 
more likely met.  More business may then be generated for the employer through repeat sales to these satisfied 
customers.
<BR><LI>Self-regulation of the industry:  Several states have proposed legislation that would regulate the microcomputer 
industry.  A self-regulating industry that certifies its own members with a program such as A+ can often minimize 
such government-imposed controls.</MENU><BR>
<HR><BR>
<CENTER><H2>Who May Take the Tests</H2></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
A+ Certification is open to anyone who wants to take the tests.  No specific requirements are necessary, except 
payment of the fee.  Individuals may retake the test modules as often as they like, but the Core and one specialty must 
be passed within 90 days of each other in order to become certified.
<BR><BR><HR><BR>
<CENTER><H2>How the Program Was Developed</CENTER></H2>
<BR><BR>
Developing the A+ service technician test modules is a rigorous, continuous and thorough process, resulting in 
statistically-proven validity and reliability.  A long list of CompTIA member companies, including the world's largest 
computer vendors, distributors, resellers, and third-party maintenance organizations, joined together to develop the A+ 
test.  Committees consisting of CompTIA members spent hundreds of hours to develop a Certification program that is 
relevant to the industry as a whole.  They contributed enormous resources to ensure that all aspects of the A+ 
Certification exams meet the highest quality standards. Hands-on service technicians from manufacturers and resellers 
defined the test content.<BR><BR>
The questions were written by experts in the field of microcomputer service.  A multi-level review process for all the 
questions ensured that they are accurate as well as psychometrically sound.  Those who participated in writing the 
questions and reviewing them are confident that candidates will find the tests tough but fair.<BR><BR>
The representatives from CompTIA, with the assistance and advice of Drake Prometric experts who administer the test, 
prepared the examination.  The two organizations jointly hold responsibility for its validity.<BR><BR>

You may cancel or reschedule a test no later than 48 hours prior to the test date.  If you cancel or reschedule later than 
48 hours prior to the test date, you will forfeit your payment.

<CENTER><H3>Taking the Test</H3></CENTER>

You should arrive at the testing center at least 15 minutes before the test is scheduled to begin.  You should identify 
yourself to the administrator of the testing center; you will then have an opportunity to learn how to use the computer-
based testing system before your actual test begins.Bring two forms of identification with you.  One form should be a photo ID, such as a valid driver's license or a passport.  
The other can be a major credit card.Books, calculators, laptop computers, or other reference materials are not allowed during any A+ test.  Because the 
tests are computer-based, you will not need pens, pencils, or paper.
<CENTER><H3>After the Test</H3></CENTER>
As soon as you finish a test, you receive the final score.  You see the results immediately on the computer screen.  In 
addition, a hard copy of the score report is provided at the testing center.
The score report shows whether you passed the exam or not.  You can also see how well you did on each section of the 
test.
<BR><BR>
After you pass the Core exam and one specialty module, an A+ Certification certificate will be mailed to you within a 
few days.  You will also receive a lapel pin and credit-card sized credential that shows you are A+ certified.
If you do not pass the exam, you can register at any time to take the exam again.  But the Core and specialty module 
must be taken within 90 days of each other.  If you fail to pass both exams within 90 days, you will not be granted 
certification.  You would then have to retake the Core exam, even if you had passed it previously, as well as retake the 
specialty module.
<BR><BR>
The A+ Service Technician exams cover generic content areas.  The Core module content covers procedures and 
information about technologies that are not related to vendor-specific products.  Instead, the Core test is a tool to 
demonstrate your fundamental knowledge related to the tasks of a computer service technician, without regard for brand 
of products.<BR><BR>
The specialty modules focus on the tasks of a computer service technician that are related to operating system 
environments commonly encountered in the industry:  Microsoft Windows/DOS environments and the Mac operating 
system.  <BR><BR>

<CENTER><H1>Certification For Imaging Professionals</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><H2>The Competitive Edge Of The 90s</H2></CENTER>
<P>CDIA (Certified Document Imaging Architect) is a program for document 
imaging professionals. This certification program will test for base-line 
competency. The program is backed by major hardware and software vendors, 
distributors, resellers and publications, as well as the computer industry's 
major organization: the Computing Technology Industry Association.  The test 
is scheduled to "go live" in the fourth quarter of 1995, with periodic 
updates after that.</P>

Anyone who wants a nationally-recognized credential as a competent document 
imaging professional can take the CDIA test. The test requires a command 
of the fundamental knowledge of what makes up an imaging system.<BR><BR>

Candidates for certification register by phone and schedule their testing 
session at a Drake Prometric Authorized Testing Center, in any of the 50 
states nationwide, and in 80+ other countries worldwide. Candidates who 
pass the computer-based test become certified, demonstrating basic knowledge 
of the major areas and technologies that make up or affect an imaging system:  
input/capture; display; storage; records management, retrieval and indexing; 
communications/networking; output; and imaging business issues.<BR><BR>

Earning CDIA certification means that you possess the knowledge, skills, 
and customer relations skills essential for a successful imaging solution 
provider, as defined by experts from companies across the industry. More 
than 26 organizations have contributed more than two hundred and thirty 
five thousand dollars and thousands of hours of time to research, develop 
and provide the computer-based test.<BR><BR><HR>
<CENTER><H2>Why Certification is Important</H2></CENTER>
Individual imaging architects gain valuable benefits from becoming CDIA 
certified:<MENU>
<LI>Enhanced job opportunities. Potential employers may give preference in hiring those who are CDIA 
certified. They view CDIA as proof that the new hire knows the generic procedures and fundamental 
technologies required to be a successful imaging solutions provider.
<BR><LI>Recognized proof of professional achievement. The CDIA credential validates that 
the holder has reached a level of competence commonly accepted and valued by the industry.
<BR><LI>Opportunity for advancement. The CDIA credential can be a plus when 
an employer awards job enhancements and promotions. Becoming CDIA certified 
may also serve as a pre-requisite to attending a course, or perhaps testing 
out of a portion of a course, which may lead to job advancement. </MENU>
The industry also gains benefits from the widespread acceptance of the CDIA credential, including:<MENU>
<BR><LI>Lower training costs. Resellers and other employers of imaging professionals can save money and 
increase productive work-time when vendors eliminate redundant time-
consuming base-level training and instead require CDIA certification as a pre-requisite.
<BR><LI>Customer satisfaction. When employees have a credential that proves their competency, customer 
expectations are more likely met. More business is then generated for the employer through repeat sales to 
these satisfied customers.
<BR><LI>Self-regulation of the industry. Several states have proposed legislation that would regulate the 
microcomputer industry. A self-regulating industry that certifies its own members with a program like CDIA 
can often avoid such government control.</MENU>
<CENTER><H2>Who May Take the Test?</H2></CENTER>
CDIA Certification is open to anyone who wants to take the test. No specific requirement is necessary, 
except payment of the fee. Individuals may retake the test as often as they like.<BR><BR>
<CENTER><H2>How the test was developed </H2></CENTER>
A long list of companies, including the industry's leading imaging systems vendors, distributors, and 
consulting organizations joined with CompTIA and its partner Drake Prometric to develop the CDIA test. 
They contributed enormous resources to assure that all aspects of CDIA Certification meet the highest 
quality standards.Teams of industry experts spent hundreds of hours to develop a certification program that is relevant to the 
industry as a whole. Hands-on imaging solutions professionals defined the test content.<BR><BR>
The questions that appear on the test are being written by experts in the field of document imaging and 
document management. A multi-level review process for all the questions will ensure that they are accurate 
as well as psychometrically sound. Those who are participating in writing the questions and reviewing them 
are confident that candidates will find the test tough but fair.<BR><BR>
The representatives of CompTIA, with the assistance and advice of Drake Prometric experts, are preparing 
the examination. The two organizations jointly hold responsibility for its validity.

<CENTER><STRONG>Storage Section</STRONG></CENTER><PRE>

This section of the CDIA exam tests your knowledge of topics such as:

       What technologies are available for data storage that will 
          meet all of the requirements of a complex document 
          management system?

        There is no single type of data storage that will meet all of 
        the requirements.  Most document imaging systems include a 
        variety of different storage technologies:

        *  RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Drives)  this is a 
        good storage companion for optical storage.  Fast data 
        transfer rates, large image files, safety, expandability, and 
        fault tolerant.

        *  HSM (Hierarchical Storage Management)  disk, optical and 
        tape are used in a hierarchy to maximize performance while 
        reducing storage costs.  HSM systems automatically migrate the 
        data from primary storage on the file server to secondary 
        storage  i.e., disk drives, optical jukeboxes, tape 
        libraries.

        *  Magneto Optical  speedy random access to data, 
        per-megabyte cost-effective, reliability, long media life, 
        multi-function capabilities and portability, seek times range 
        from 20-50 ms.

        *  Optical Jukeboxes  provides for high capacity, near line 
        storage of documents. WORM, rewritable and multi-function 
        media are available in 3-1/2_ to 5-1/4_ formats to meet a 
        variety of storage needs.                    </PRE><HR>

This portion of the test lets you demonstrate know-how in such areas as:

	Do laws exist for admitting optically stored records as evidence?
          a)      Yes, in all 50 states.
          b)      These are determined case by case.
          c)      The 1964 Uniform Rules of Evidence includes them.
          d)      None of the above.

       If business records are stored on optical disks, can the 
         original paper records be destroyed? 
         a)      Yes, unless prohibited by law.

The CDIA test is administered on a computer at a Drake Prometric 
Authorized Testing Center, in an easy-to-use format, in a 
computer-based format.

The format of the test on the computer looks very much like other 
examinations that you have taken before. The difference is, you take 
this exam on a desktop computer connected into a testing network, 
where all the data is stored centrally and securely. Directions for 
using the testing software are displayed on the screen. A tutorial is 
provided as is the assistance of a nearby proctor. On-screen 늗elp is 
also available, including information at the bottom of the screen that 
lets you know how to enter your answer, move forward in the test, mark 
a question for answering later, or review a previous question. Of 
course, the software tells you how to enter the answer, not what 
answer to enter. 

The CDIA exam includes a variety of questions and formats. The exact 
set and sequence of questions varies with each sign on. Every question 
has at least one correct answer provided in the list of alternative 
choices you are given on screen. Question formats Questions may appear 
in any of the following formats 

       Situational 
       Traditional 
       Identification

Situational questions describe a situation or scenario commonly 
encountered by document imaging professionals while on the job.  Your 
choice of answers will list different ways to resolve the problem or 
situation.

Traditional multiple-choice questions appear most commonly on the 
test.  These questions ask you to fill in the blank or pick the 
correct answer to a question from a given list of choices.

Identification questions may include a diagram, flowchart, or 
illustration with several items called out with arrows, numbers or 
letters.  You are asked to choose the answer that correctly identifies 
what is being shown or described in the question.

No matter what the format of the question, there will be at least one 
correct answer and your challenge is to select it.  When there are 
multiple correct answers, a message at the bottom of the screen tells 
you to 늒hoose all that apply.  Be sure to read the messages.

Taking a giant step toward the first industry-wide, vendor independent 
certification program for Information Technology (IT) Skills, 
representatives of seven leading companies met recently under the 
umbrella of the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) in 
Santa Clara, CA, to sketch out the broad outlines of a new multi-phase 
effort.  Phase I of the IT Skills program will focus on certification 
of individuals who perform networking and connectivity-related 
operations.

Calling themselves the ITSkills Certification Committee, the group of 
seven that met in Santa Clara also released a mission statement for 
the new initiative:  뉷efine and drive the worldwide adoption of 
Information Technology job skills standards and certifications that 
meet the changing needs of IT professionals, employers and clients.

The seven companies that formed the committee, under the auspices of 
CompTIA, represent a broad cross-section of the computer industry.  In 
taking this important step, they have assumed a leadership role in 
formulating the ITSkills certification program by collectively 
agreeing to fund project costs and commit the necessary resources and 
people to ensure the initiative뇹 success.  Companies represented at 
the Santa Clara meeting included:  Banyan Systems, Compaq, 
Hewlett-Packard, IBMPCCompany, Lotus Develop ment, Microsoft, and 
Novell.

An Industry-Driven Initiative

늉e are excited to be a part of the effort that will bring to the 
industry a certification program that will benefit everyone, beginning 
with our corporate computing end-user customers to the resellers and 
back up the channel to the manufacturers.  Certification has been an 
on-going critical need in the computer industry for a long time and an 
issue CompTIA has addressed in other arenas for the past three years, 
notably A+and our  new Certified Document Imaging Architect 
designation.  We believe the plan th at was just developed meets all 
the criteria and needs of each of the channel segments that have 
grappled with the issue of multi-vendor certification over the years, 
said John Venator, Executive Vice President and CEO of CompTIA.

늉e expect that in the near future, 넬T Skills Certified will be a 
new standard in the computer industry, noted Barbara Faucett, 
CompTIAChairman and Executive Director of LMBMicrocomputers in 
Indianapolis.  뉼t will symbolize technical competency and provide 
many bottom-line benefits to resellers, customers, and manufacturers 
alike.

The new program underscores CompTIA뇹 commitment to improving the 
professionalism of the computer and information technology industries 
and is designed to meet several important objectives: 

     (1) providing a benchmark of expertise and competency in the increasingly 
         complicated area of Information Technology; 
     (2) increasing public confidence in the computer reseller and service 
          channels; 
     (3) building individual competency and self-esteem; and 
     (4) providing a framework for professional growth.

뉶ustomers have long been asking for a certification framework that 
reflects the multivendor nature of Information Technology today, 
commented Nancy Lewis, Director of Education andCertification at 
Microsoft in Redmond, WA.  

늆he CompTIAtask force is uniquely positioned to meet this 
requirement, because it combines the broad base of experience of 
IT-certification industry leaders and access to ITprofessionals 
worldwide.  Microsoft is a long-time member of CompTIA and 
participates in a variety of Associati on programs, including the 
ITSkills Certification Committee.

뉷ue to the large number of multi-vendor enterprise networks, 
customers need cohesive standards of competence to completely leverage 
networking technology, said Dorene Woodrow, Customer Services Product 
Manager  at Banyan Systems in Westboro, MA, and a participant on the 
IT Skills Certification Committee.  뉶ompTIA has the ability to 
deliver the performance standards that will benefit IT professionals 
and clients throughout the industry.

Why Another Certification Program?

늁ovell has always been  and continues to be  committed to 
multi-vendor certification, said Rick Romine, Director of Strategic 
Development at Novell Education in San Jose, CA.  늁ovell has been at 
the heart of this issue from the beginning, and we are continuing to 
work with vendors, industry associations, and professionals to create 
these multi-vendor initiatives.

Romine went on to say, 늆he multi-vendor certification we are pursuing 
with the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) will 
ensure a base level of competence in key IT skills for computer 
professionals.  Much of the success of the industry depends on the end 
user뇹 acceptance and usage of new technologies, and the industry뇹 
ability to adequately integrate and service those technologies.  
That뇹 what makes multi-vendor certification  and our relationship 
with CompTIA  so important.  CompTIA h as the necessary commitment to 
the program to expedite and accelerate its development. Everyone, 
especially the end user, will benefit from that commitment.

Program Development

Prior to beginning development of the new program, several of the 
vendors participating in the ITSkills Certification Committee 
conducted a survey of end-user customers.  The information from those 
studies is being used, along with input from training and IS managers, 
to define a job profile, highlighting the key job tasks and 
responsibilities of ITprofessionals. Certification exams will then be 
developed and administered to ensure that individuals have mastered 
the fundamentals of their job.  Successful c andidates will receive a 
certificate acknowledging their ITSkills credential. Exams will be 
offered periodically throughout subsequent years, with recertification 
required.

A Track Record of Results and Successes

CompTIA뇹 involvement in industry-wide, vendor-neutral certification 
began over two years ago when it launched a similarCertification 
program, called A+, for computer service technicians.  The ITSkills 
Certification will follow the successful model of A+, although in an 
entirely different arena. Dedicated to strengthening and growing the 
computer industry, CompTIA뇹 A+ multi-vendor certification program met 
and exceeded its initial target of 5,000 certified computer service 
technicians in its first year.  Further, A+ Certification has gotten 
high marks throughout the computer industry with more than 40 of the 
industry뇹 leading vendors rallying behind it with their financial 
support and technical expertise.

늉e have achieved significant milestones in the A+ program, with more 
than 16,000 Service Technicians currently A+Certified and some 1,005 
A+Authorized Service Centers across the U.S. and Canada, CompTIA뇹 
Venator explained.  뉼n mid-1994, we began exploring the possibilities 
for broadening our certification efforts to include new technologies 
and new professions.  The ITSkills Certification Committee is an 
offshoot of those efforts.  Venator went on to say, 늉e are bringing 
the educational benefits and o pportunities of certification to more 
industry players with this latest effort.  As a result, we will have a 
better educated and technically proficient base of computer 
professionals.

you can participate, call Jean Alexander at (708) 268-1818, ext. 321; 
by fax:  (708) 268-1834; CompuServe:  75300,2507.


The Computing Technology Industry Association (formerly ABCD: The 
Microcomputer Industry Association) is a national not-for-profit 
association of more than 6,180 microcomputer resellers, manufacturers, 
software publishers, distributors and service companies. Its mission 
is to foster high levels of professional competence and business 
ethics among its members and the computer industry. Combined sales of 
CompTIA members account for 62% of all microcomputer sales in North 
America. </PRE>

<CENTER><H1>What Is A+ Certification?</H1></CENTER>
<BR>
<P> A+ Certification is a testing program sponsored by the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) 
that certifies the competency of service technicians in the computer industry.  Anyone who wants a nationally-
recognized credential as a competent computer service professional can take the A+ exams.  The program is backed by 
major computer hardware and software vendors, distributors, resellers and publications, as well as a leading industry 
service organization, the Association of Field Service Management, Inc. The test, which is administered by Drake 
Prometric (Bloomington, MN), was first available in July 1993, with periodic updates since then. <P>
<BR>
<P>Earning A+ certification means that you possess the knowledge, skills, and customer relations skills essential for a 
successful computer service technician, as defined by experts from companies across the industry.  The exams cover a 
broad range of hardware and software technologies, but are not related to any vendor-specific products.  More than 40 
organizations have contributed time and budget resources to develop the A+ computer-based tests.</P><BR>
<P>To become certified, you must pass two test modules  the Core and one of two other specialties, either the Microsoft 
Windows/DOS module or the Macintosh module. When candidates pass the Core plus a specialty, they receive a 
certificate that mentions the specialty module they passed, such as</P>

<MENU>
<BR><LI>A+ Certification Exam with a specialty in Microsoft Windows/DOS environments
<BR><LI>A+ Certification Exam with a specialty in Macintosh OS-based Computers
<BR></MENU><BR>
Individuals who were already A+ certified when the enhanced exams 'went live' in April 1995 need not retake the test 
to remain A+ certified. Candidates for certification may register by phone by calling 1-800-77-MICRO (1-800-776-4276) and schedule 
their testing session at a Drake Authorized Testing Center, in any of the 50 states nationwide, and in 150+ other 
countries worldwide.  Candidates who pass the two computer-based test modules become certified, demonstrating 
basic knowledge of configuring, installing, diagnosing, repairing, upgrading, and maintaining microcomputers and 
associated technologies.<BR><HR>
<CENTER><H2>Why Certification is Important</H2></CENTER>
<BR>
Individual service technicians gain valuable benefits from becoming A+ certified, including:

<BR><MENU>
<BR><LI>Recognized proof of professional achievement:  The A+ credential validates that the holder has reached a level of 
competence commonly accepted and valued by the industry.
<BR><LI>Enhanced job opportunities:   Many employers give preference in hiring applicants with A+ Certification.  Some 
employers may require A+ as a condition of employment. They view A+ as proof that a new hire knows the 
procedures and technologies required to be a successful computer service technician.
<BR><LI>Opportunity for advancement:   The A+ credential can be a plus when an employer awards job advancements and 
promotions.
<BR><LI>Training requirement:  A+ Certification may be required as a pre-requisite to attending a vendor's training course, so employers will offer advanced training to 
those employees who are already A+ Certified.
<BR><LI>Customer confidence:  As the general public learns about A+, customers will require that only certified technicians be 
assigned to their accounts.  The technician then arrives at a client site already known as a competent computer service 
professional. The industry also gains benefits from the widespread acceptance of the A+ credential, including:
<BR><LI>Lower training costs:  Resellers and other employers of service technicians can save money and increase productive 
work-time when vendors eliminate redundant, time-consuming base-level training and instead require A+ Certification 
as a pre-requisite.
<BR><LI>Customer satisfaction:  When employees have a credential that proves their competency, customer expectations are 
more likely met.  More business may then be generated for the employer through repeat sales to these satisfied 
customers.
<BR><LI>Self-regulation of the industry:  Several states have proposed legislation that would regulate the microcomputer 
industry.  A self-regulating industry that certifies its own members with a program such as A+ can often minimize 
such government-imposed controls.</MENU><BR>
<HR><BR>
<CENTER><H2>Who May Take the Tests</H2></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
A+ Certification is open to anyone who wants to take the tests.  No specific requirements are necessary, except 
payment of the fee.  Individuals may retake the test modules as often as they like, but the Core and one specialty must 
be passed within 90 days of each other in order to become certified.
<BR><BR><HR><BR>
<CENTER><H2>How the Program Was Developed</CENTER></H2>
<BR><BR>
Developing the A+ service technician test modules is a rigorous, continuous and thorough process, resulting in 
statistically-proven validity and reliability.  A long list of CompTIA member companies, including the world's largest 
computer vendors, distributors, resellers, and third-party maintenance organizations, joined together to develop the A+ 
test.  Committees consisting of CompTIA members spent hundreds of hours to develop a Certification program that is 
relevant to the industry as a whole.  They contributed enormous resources to ensure that all aspects of the A+ 
Certification exams meet the highest quality standards. Hands-on service technicians from manufacturers and resellers 
defined the test content.<BR><BR>
The questions were written by experts in the field of microcomputer service.  A multi-level review process for all the 
questions ensured that they are accurate as well as psychometrically sound.  Those who participated in writing the 
questions and reviewing them are confident that candidates will find the tests tough but fair.<BR><BR>
The representatives from CompTIA, with the assistance and advice of Drake Prometric experts who administer the test, 
prepared the examination.  The two organizations jointly hold responsibility for its validity.<BR><BR>

Pay for the A+ test at the same time you call to register.  You may use a credit card or have an invoice sent to you or 
your employer.  If you have an invoice sent, you can pay by check.  Remember that you cannot schedule time at the 
testing center until Drake has received your payment in full.

<CENTER><H3>Cancellation Policy</H3></CENTER>
You may cancel or reschedule a test no later than 48 hours prior to the test date.  If you cancel or reschedule later than 
48 hours prior to the test date, you will forfeit your payment.

<CENTER><H3>Taking the Test</H3></CENTER>

You should arrive at the testing center at least 15 minutes before the test is scheduled to begin.  You should identify 
yourself to the administrator of the testing center; you will then have an opportunity to learn how to use the computer-
based testing system before your actual test begins.Bring two forms of identification with you.  One form should be a photo ID, such as a valid driver's license or a passport.  
The other can be a major credit card.Books, calculators, laptop computers, or other reference materials are not allowed during any A+ test.  Because the 
tests are computer-based, you will not need pens, pencils, or paper.
<CENTER><H3>After the Test</H3></CENTER>
As soon as you finish a test, you receive the final score.  You see the results immediately on the computer screen.  In 
addition, a hard copy of the score report is provided at the testing center.
The score report shows whether you passed the exam or not.  You can also see how well you did on each section of the 
test.
<BR><BR>
After you pass the Core exam and one specialty module, an A+ Certification certificate will be mailed to you within a 
few days.  You will also receive a lapel pin and credit-card sized credential that shows you are A+ certified.
If you do not pass the exam, you can register at any time to take the exam again.  But the Core and specialty module 
must be taken within 90 days of each other.  If you fail to pass both exams within 90 days, you will not be granted 
certification.  You would then have to retake the Core exam, even if you had passed it previously, as well as retake the 
specialty module.
<BR><BR>
The A+ Service Technician exams cover generic content areas.  The Core module content covers procedures and 
information about technologies that are not related to vendor-specific products.  Instead, the Core test is a tool to 
demonstrate your fundamental knowledge related to the tasks of a computer service technician, without regard for brand 
of products.<BR><BR>
The specialty modules focus on the tasks of a computer service technician that are related to operating system 
environments commonly encountered in the industry:  Microsoft Windows/DOS environments and the Mac operating 
system.  <BR><BR>
Even though the tests are designed to cover fundamental level knowledge and skills, they are still challenging.

<CENTER><H1>Certification For Imaging Professionals</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><H2>The Competitive Edge Of The 90s</H2></CENTER>
<P>CDIA (Certified Document Imaging Architect) is a program for document 
imaging professionals. This certification program will test for base-line 
competency. The program is backed by major hardware and software vendors, 
distributors, resellers and publications, as well as the computer industry's 
major organization: the Computing Technology Industry Association.  The test 
is scheduled to "go live" in the fourth quarter of 1995, with periodic 
updates after that.</P>

Anyone who wants a nationally-recognized credential as a competent document 
imaging professional can take the CDIA test. The test requires a command 
of the fundamental knowledge of what makes up an imaging system.<BR><BR>

Candidates for certification register by phone and schedule their testing 
session at a Drake Prometric Authorized Testing Center, in any of the 50 
states nationwide, and in 80+ other countries worldwide. Candidates who 
pass the computer-based test become certified, demonstrating basic knowledge 
of the major areas and technologies that make up or affect an imaging system:  
input/capture; display; storage; records management, retrieval and indexing; 
communications/networking; output; and imaging business issues.<BR><BR>

Earning CDIA certification means that you possess the knowledge, skills, 
and customer relations skills essential for a successful imaging solution 
provider, as defined by experts from companies across the industry. More 
than 26 organizations have contributed more than two hundred and thirty 
five thousand dollars and thousands of hours of time to research, develop 
and provide the computer-based test.<BR><BR><HR>
<CENTER><H2>Why Certification is Important</H2></CENTER>
Individual imaging architects gain valuable benefits from becoming CDIA 
certified:<MENU>
<LI>Enhanced job opportunities. Potential employers may give preference in hiring those who are CDIA 
certified. They view CDIA as proof that the new hire knows the generic procedures and fundamental 
technologies required to be a successful imaging solutions provider.
<BR><LI>Recognized proof of professional achievement. The CDIA credential validates that 
the holder has reached a level of competence commonly accepted and valued by the industry.
<BR><LI>Opportunity for advancement. The CDIA credential can be a plus when 
an employer awards job enhancements and promotions. Becoming CDIA certified 
may also serve as a pre-requisite to attending a course, or perhaps testing 
out of a portion of a course, which may lead to job advancement. </MENU>
The industry also gains benefits from the widespread acceptance of the CDIA credential, including:<MENU>
<BR><LI>Lower training costs. Resellers and other employers of imaging professionals can save money and 
increase productive work-time when vendors eliminate redundant time-
consuming base-level training and instead require CDIA certification as a pre-requisite.
<BR><LI>Customer satisfaction. When employees have a credential that proves their competency, customer 
expectations are more likely met. More business is then generated for the employer through repeat sales to 
these satisfied customers.
<BR><LI>Self-regulation of the industry. Several states have proposed legislation that would regulate the 
microcomputer industry. A self-regulating industry that certifies its own members with a program like CDIA 
can often avoid such government control.</MENU>
<CENTER><H2>Who May Take the Test?</H2></CENTER>
CDIA Certification is open to anyone who wants to take the test. No specific requirement is necessary, 
except payment of the fee. Individuals may retake the test as often as they like.<BR><BR>
<CENTER><H2>How the test was developed </H2></CENTER>
A long list of companies, including the industry's leading imaging systems vendors, distributors, and 
consulting organizations joined with CompTIA and its partner Drake Prometric to develop the CDIA test. 
They contributed enormous resources to assure that all aspects of CDIA Certification meet the highest 
quality standards.Teams of industry experts spent hundreds of hours to develop a certification program that is relevant to the 
industry as a whole. Hands-on imaging solutions professionals defined the test content.<BR><BR>
The questions that appear on the test are being written by experts in the field of document imaging and 
document management. A multi-level review process for all the questions will ensure that they are accurate 
as well as psychometrically sound. Those who are participating in writing the questions and reviewing them 
are confident that candidates will find the test tough but fair.<BR><BR>
The representatives of CompTIA, with the assistance and advice of Drake Prometric experts, are preparing 
the examination. The two organizations jointly hold responsibility for its validity.

should arrive at the testing center at least 15 minutes before the 
test is scheduled to begin. You will identify yourself to the 
administrator of the testing center and have an opportunity to learn 
how to use the computer-based testing system before your actual test 
begins. 

     Bring two forms of identification with you. One form should be a 
photo ID such as a valid driver뇹 license. The other can be a major 
credit card, or a passport. Books, calculators, laptop computers, or 
other reference materials are not allowed during the test. Because the 
test is computer-based, you will not need pens, pencils, or paper. 

     After the test As soon as you finish the test, you receive the final 
score. You will see the results immediately on the computer screen. In 
addition, a hard copy of the score report is provided at the test 
center. The score report shows whether you passed the exam or not. You 
can also see how well you did on each section of the test and on each 
technology. (Sections and technologies are described later in this 
brochure.) The score report will look similar to this one.

     If you pass the exam, a CDIA Certification certificate will be 
mailed to you within a few days. If you do not pass the exam, you can 
register at any time to take the exam again. The CDIA exam for imaging 
solutions professionals covers generic content areas; the questions 
are mainly related to procedures and information about technologies 
that are not related to specific vendor-supplied products. Instead, 
the test is a tool to demonstrate your fundamental knowledge related 
to the tasks of developing a document imaging solution, without regard 
for brand. But even though the test is fundamental, it is still 
challenging.                                        </PRE>

<CENTER><STRONG>Storage Section</STRONG></CENTER><PRE>

This section of the CDIA exam tests your knowledge of topics such as:

       What technologies are available for data storage that will 
          meet all of the requirements of a complex document 
          management system?

        There is no single type of data storage that will meet all of 
        the requirements.  Most document imaging systems include a 
        variety of different storage technologies:

        *  RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Drives)  this is a 
        good storage companion for optical storage.  Fast data 
        transfer rates, large image files, safety, expandability, and 
        fault tolerant.

        *  HSM (Hierarchical Storage Management)  disk, optical and 
        tape are used in a hierarchy to maximize performance while 
        reducing storage costs.  HSM systems automatically migrate the 
        data from primary storage on the file server to secondary 
        storage  i.e., disk drives, optical jukeboxes, tape 
        libraries.

        *  Magneto Optical  speedy random access to data, 
        per-megabyte cost-effective, reliability, long media life, 
        multi-function capabilities and portability, seek times range 
        from 20-50 ms.

        *  Optical Jukeboxes  provides for high capacity, near line 
        storage of documents. WORM, rewritable and multi-function 
        media are available in 3-1/2_ to 5-1/4_ formats to meet a 
        variety of storage needs.                    </PRE><HR>

crucial factor is at what level the imaging software is communicating 
with the network.  This section questions you about your knowledge of 
the following network-related topics:

	Topology
		Physical Network
			Token Ring vs. Ethernet
			UTP, Type 1, Type 3, Fiber
		Protocol
			NetBIOS
			TCP/IP
			IPX/SPX

The CDIA test is administered on a computer at a Drake Prometric 
Authorized Testing Center, in an easy-to-use format, in a 
computer-based format.

The format of the test on the computer looks very much like other 
examinations that you have taken before. The difference is, you take 
this exam on a desktop computer connected into a testing network, 
where all the data is stored centrally and securely. Directions for 
using the testing software are displayed on the screen. A tutorial is 
provided as is the assistance of a nearby proctor. On-screen 늗elp is 
also available, including information at the bottom of the screen that 
lets you know how to enter your answer, move forward in the test, mark 
a question for answering later, or review a previous question. Of 
course, the software tells you how to enter the answer, not what 
answer to enter. 

The CDIA exam includes a variety of questions and formats. The exact 
set and sequence of questions varies with each sign on. Every question 
has at least one correct answer provided in the list of alternative 
choices you are given on screen. Question formats Questions may appear 
in any of the following formats 

       Situational 
       Traditional 
       Identification

Situational questions describe a situation or scenario commonly 
encountered by document imaging professionals while on the job.  Your 
choice of answers will list different ways to resolve the problem or 
situation.

Traditional multiple-choice questions appear most commonly on the 
test.  These questions ask you to fill in the blank or pick the 
correct answer to a question from a given list of choices.

Identification questions may include a diagram, flowchart, or 
illustration with several items called out with arrows, numbers or 
letters.  You are asked to choose the answer that correctly identifies 
what is being shown or described in the question.

No matter what the format of the question, there will be at least one 
correct answer and your challenge is to select it.  When there are 
multiple correct answers, a message at the bottom of the screen tells 
you to 늒hoose all that apply.  Be sure to read the messages.

Taking a giant step toward the first industry-wide, vendor independent 
certification program for Information Technology (IT) Skills, 
representatives of seven leading companies met recently under the 
umbrella of the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) in 
Santa Clara, CA, to sketch out the broad outlines of a new multi-phase 
effort.  Phase I of the IT Skills program will focus on certification 
of individuals who perform networking and connectivity-related 
operations.

Calling themselves the ITSkills Certification Committee, the group of 
seven that met in Santa Clara also released a mission statement for 
the new initiative:  뉷efine and drive the worldwide adoption of 
Information Technology job skills standards and certifications that 
meet the changing needs of IT professionals, employers and clients.

The seven companies that formed the committee, under the auspices of 
CompTIA, represent a broad cross-section of the computer industry.  In 
taking this important step, they have assumed a leadership role in 
formulating the ITSkills certification program by collectively 
agreeing to fund project costs and commit the necessary resources and 
people to ensure the initiative뇹 success.  Companies represented at 
the Santa Clara meeting included:  Banyan Systems, Compaq, 
Hewlett-Packard, IBMPCCompany, Lotus Develop ment, Microsoft, and 
Novell.

An Industry-Driven Initiative

늉e are excited to be a part of the effort that will bring to the 
industry a certification program that will benefit everyone, beginning 
with our corporate computing end-user customers to the resellers and 
back up the channel to the manufacturers.  Certification has been an 
on-going critical need in the computer industry for a long time and an 
issue CompTIA has addressed in other arenas for the past three years, 
notably A+and our  new Certified Document Imaging Architect 
designation.  We believe the plan th at was just developed meets all 
the criteria and needs of each of the channel segments that have 
grappled with the issue of multi-vendor certification over the years, 
said John Venator, Executive Vice President and CEO of CompTIA.

늉e expect that in the near future, 넬T Skills Certified will be a 
new standard in the computer industry, noted Barbara Faucett, 
CompTIAChairman and Executive Director of LMBMicrocomputers in 
Indianapolis.  뉼t will symbolize technical competency and provide 
many bottom-line benefits to resellers, customers, and manufacturers 
alike.

The new program underscores CompTIA뇹 commitment to improving the 
professionalism of the computer and information technology industries 
and is designed to meet several important objectives: 

     (1) providing a benchmark of expertise and competency in the increasingly 
         complicated area of Information Technology; 
     (2) increasing public confidence in the computer reseller and service 
          channels; 
     (3) building individual competency and self-esteem; and 
     (4) providing a framework for professional growth.

뉶ustomers have long been asking for a certification framework that 
reflects the multivendor nature of Information Technology today, 
commented Nancy Lewis, Director of Education andCertification at 
Microsoft in Redmond, WA.  

늆he CompTIAtask force is uniquely positioned to meet this 
requirement, because it combines the broad base of experience of 
IT-certification industry leaders and access to ITprofessionals 
worldwide.  Microsoft is a long-time member of CompTIA and 
participates in a variety of Associati on programs, including the 
ITSkills Certification Committee.

뉷ue to the large number of multi-vendor enterprise networks, 
customers need cohesive standards of competence to completely leverage 
networking technology, said Dorene Woodrow, Customer Services Product 
Manager  at Banyan Systems in Westboro, MA, and a participant on the 
IT Skills Certification Committee.  뉶ompTIA has the ability to 
deliver the performance standards that will benefit IT professionals 
and clients throughout the industry.

Why Another Certification Program?

늁ovell has always been  and continues to be  committed to 
multi-vendor certification, said Rick Romine, Director of Strategic 
Development at Novell Education in San Jose, CA.  늁ovell has been at 
the heart of this issue from the beginning, and we are continuing to 
work with vendors, industry associations, and professionals to create 
these multi-vendor initiatives.

Romine went on to say, 늆he multi-vendor certification we are pursuing 
with the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) will 
ensure a base level of competence in key IT skills for computer 
professionals.  Much of the success of the industry depends on the end 
user뇹 acceptance and usage of new technologies, and the industry뇹 
ability to adequately integrate and service those technologies.  
That뇹 what makes multi-vendor certification  and our relationship 
with CompTIA  so important.  CompTIA h as the necessary commitment to 
the program to expedite and accelerate its development. Everyone, 
especially the end user, will benefit from that commitment.

Program Development

Prior to beginning development of the new program, several of the 
vendors participating in the ITSkills Certification Committee 
conducted a survey of end-user customers.  The information from those 
studies is being used, along with input from training and IS managers, 
to define a job profile, highlighting the key job tasks and 
responsibilities of ITprofessionals. Certification exams will then be 
developed and administered to ensure that individuals have mastered 
the fundamentals of their job.  Successful c andidates will receive a 
certificate acknowledging their ITSkills credential. Exams will be 
offered periodically throughout subsequent years, with recertification 
required.

A Track Record of Results and Successes

CompTIA뇹 involvement in industry-wide, vendor-neutral certification 
began over two years ago when it launched a similarCertification 
program, called A+, for computer service technicians.  The ITSkills 
Certification will follow the successful model of A+, although in an 
entirely different arena. Dedicated to strengthening and growing the 
computer industry, CompTIA뇹 A+ multi-vendor certification program met 
and exceeded its initial target of 5,000 certified computer service 
technicians in its first year.  Further, A+ Certification has gotten 
high marks throughout the computer industry with more than 40 of the 
industry뇹 leading vendors rallying behind it with their financial 
support and technical expertise.

늉e have achieved significant milestones in the A+ program, with more 
than 16,000 Service Technicians currently A+Certified and some 1,005 
A+Authorized Service Centers across the U.S. and Canada, CompTIA뇹 
Venator explained.  뉼n mid-1994, we began exploring the possibilities 
for broadening our certification efforts to include new technologies 
and new professions.  The ITSkills Certification Committee is an 
offshoot of those efforts.  Venator went on to say, 늉e are bringing 
the educational benefits and o pportunities of certification to more 
industry players with this latest effort.  As a result, we will have a 
better educated and technically proficient base of computer 
professionals.

you can participate, call Jean Alexander at (708) 268-1818, ext. 321; 
by fax:  (708) 268-1834; CompuServe:  75300,2507.


The Computing Technology Industry Association (formerly ABCD: The 
Microcomputer Industry Association) is a national not-for-profit 
association of more than 6,180 microcomputer resellers, manufacturers, 
software publishers, distributors and service companies. Its mission 
is to foster high levels of professional competence and business 
ethics among its members and the computer industry. Combined sales of 
CompTIA members account for 62% of all microcomputer sales in North 
America. </PRE>

<STRONG>Ten Ways to Make More Money in Mobile 
Technologies</STRONG></CENTER>

<PRE> The dollars in mobile technologies are being made by those who 
can think mobile. While many of us can happily listen to Mozart during 
a traffic jam, there are others who need to perform their work 
functions no matter where they are  at any time of the day or night. 
You won뇺 be able to understand mobility if you have only gone so far 
as to use a hand-held cellular phone; but it뇹 a start. The mobile 
mentality extends not only to products, but services and supplies as 
well. The mobile mindset is similar to the small office/home office 
(SOHO) marketplace: Each market requires users to have autonomy from 
organizational offices, but excellent connectivity to them. 

THE MOBILE FULL MEAL DEAL (Sorry, McDonalds)

Problem: Connecting mobile/portable PCs to a home office is necessary 
for sales people, professionals (attorneys, surgeons, auditors, etc.). 

Rationale: A PC needs correctly configured communications software 
that matches the organization뇹 needs, a working PC and cellular 
modem, a working cellular phone, and the office뇹 computer system for 
connection.

What to Do: Selling cellular products can rarely be done without a 
demonstration, but equipment and air time costs can be very expensive. 
Explore local cellular carriers to understand the commitment needed to 
become a cellular agent. 

Where to Make Money: Mobile equipment installation, service contracts 
and warranty work, cellular activation revenue, PCMCIA and serial port 
cellular modems, portable PCs and connectivity or communications 
software, and regional site communications hardware and software.

Audience: The mobile worker and four-lane surfer. 

CELLULAR DATA PACKET DATA (CDPD)

Problem: The kinds of cellular modems used today are limited in their 
data rates and reliability. CDPD devices use a more reliable method of 
connection.

Rationale: There are three big problems with transmitting data by 
cellular devices: cell switching can cause drop outs; line speed is 
often limited to 9600 baud; and many cellular phones were not designed 
with data ports that connect to PCs. 

What to Do: Develop a program to upgrade cellular modem users to CDPD. 

Where to Make Money: Equipment conversion to CDPD from the cellular 
modems to the cellular phones. Note that CDPD is currently available 
only in major areas, and still being tested in others.

Audience: Frustrated cellular modem users. 

MOBILE PRINTING PROBLEMS 

Problem: It뇹 nearly impossible to take laser quality printers into 
the field. 

Rationale: A number of portable, battery-driven printers have emerged 
that fit into extremely small spaces, yet print easily onto plain 
paper. 

What to Do: Investigate mobile printers and options.

Where to Make Money: The printer, service policy, ink-jet cartridges, 
paper supplies, mounting/installation, and printer driver installation 
into Windows or System 7.5. 

Audience: Anyone who needs to print portably. 

Mobile Fax Devices 

Problem: Getting a fax on the road is a chore.

Rationale: New portable faxes can now share telephone lines, store 
several faxes, and then either upload them to a PC  or print them on 
self-contained ink-jet printers. 

What to Do: Investigate portable, stand-alone fax machines and their 
options. 

Where to Make Money: The portable fax machine, paper and ink supplies, 
extra phone cords, mounting/installation, Windows or Mac driver 
installation and service policies. 

Audience: Heavy fax users like real estate, civil, legal, and sales 
personnel.

PORTABLE TAPE BACKUP 

Problem: Many portable and mobile computers are not ever connected to 
a LAN where they can be backed up. 

Rationale: Portable tape backups can take care of this important 
maintenance chore in short order. Data can be restored easily in the 
event of a computer loss of any type. 

What to Do: Understand portable tape backup drive options. Most 
connect through a mobile computer뇹 parallel printer port. 

Where to Make Money: The tape drive, installation of software, tapes, 
service policy, extra cables and training. 

Audience: Anyone without an easy means of backing up their mobile 
computer. 

PORTABLE MULTIMEDIA 

Problem: Few mobile systems come with multimedia components. The 
Macintosh PowerBook has them built-in, but few PCs have the necessary 
parts. 

Rationale: Many of the benefits of multimedia are lost on mobile 
users. New multimedia PCMCIA cards are available, allowing mobile and 
portable users to set up presentations. 

What to Do: If you are not already familiar with multimedia standards, 
such as the MPC-II, learn them, then learn the PCMCIA products and 
their options. 

Where to Make Money: PCMCIA multimedia kits, software installation, 
portable CD-ROM drives, extra cables, self-amplified hi-fi speakers, 
mobile or portable microphone mounts, service policies, and LCD and 
overhead projectors. 

Audience: Mobile users who need multimedia.

REMOTE E-MAIL 

Problem: Few companies have figured out how to deliver company e-mail 
to mobile workers. 

Rationale: Every good e-mail program has a remote access gateway or 
method for mobile users. Many are easy to set up on 286 or 386 PCs 
with older modems. 

What to Do: Find out what e-mail infrastructure an organization uses, 
then explore the remote user access pieces for both the office and the 
mobile side of the e-mail. 

Where to Make Money: The remote e-mail software piece, installation, 
hardware, mobile e-mail software and installation, training, and 
service and support policies. 

Audience: A growing number of mobile users who need frequent e-mail 
connectivity. 

DOCKING STATIONS 

Problem: Busy computer users dislike using file transfer software 
between a mobile computer and a machine used at the office. 

Rationale: Docking stations have improved dramatically from the early 
days of mobile computing. Many have built-in Ethernet cards, SCSI bus, 
a mouse port, a split keyboard and, occasionally, a VGA monitor 
attached. 

What to Do: Know which mobile computers have docking stations, their 
features, and the add-on/in possibilities. 

Where to Make Money: The docking station and all external accessories, 
hardware/software installation, service and support. 

Audience: Anyone who wants to shrink two PCs into one.

INSURANCE AND LOSS RECOVERY 

Problem: Mobile items are frequently lost, usually due to loss, theft, 
drop damage, weather damage, or overuse. 

Rationale: Several insurance and re-insurance companies offer policies 
for mobile computer users that cover every component except data. 

What to Do: Research which agents in your region offer insurance for 
portables and negotiate a deal. Arrange a program to service the 
emergency needs of your mobile clients.

Where to Make Money: Insurance policy commissions, maintenance, 
service, support, fast-replacement contracts and overnight disk 
replacement services. 

Audience: Every mobile user. 

MODEM KITS

Problem: Mobile users often have problems connecting at remote sites.

Rationale: Several vendors now have kits with Y-adapters, converter 
jacks, extra-length cables and other modem connectivity paraphernalia.

What to Do: Investigate the kits and their options. Try a kit so that 
you can give support to your traveling clients. After-hour support can 
have a premium associated with that support. 

Where to Make Money: From the kits and miscellaneous phone 
paraphernalia that is often found at discount stores. Spare external 
RS-232 cables, as well as PCMCIA modem-specific phone cables are hot 
items. 

Audience: Every mobile user owning a modem. 

Mobile users face many more obstacles in finding parts in remote 
regions. Establishing a good working relationship with mobile users 
and organizations can result in lots of solid business. Once 
established, the mobile dollars flow in. The trick, of course, is to 
keep them from flowing out again.

늉hile many of us can happily listen to Mozart during a traffic jam, 
there are others who need to perform their work functions no matter 
where they are  at any time of the day or night.

Top 10 Ways for Resellers to Increase Their Bottom Line</CENTER>

During the past 10 years, I have been fortunate to have the 
opportunity to meet a large number of computer resellers and discuss 
their individual recipes for success. With the fierce competition and 
skinny margins in our industry, the smart reseller must seek out and 
exploit all opportunities to increase profits. Here are the top 10 
ways (with no assistance from David Letterman) for a reseller to 
increase the bottom line. OK, away we go.

10.	Seek the agency model

Align yourself with a master reseller or distributor who can help you 
reduce your infrastructure. Carrying inventory and accounts 
receivable are the biggest headache, and often the chief reason, for 
business failure for a reseller. Today, there is an opportunity for 
resellers to have their supplier of computer products carry the 
inventory and, in many cases, the accounts receivable. The reseller 
places the order and receives their split of the profit margin. 
Besides saving on the carrying costs of inventory and accounts 
receivable, there are also savings in brick and mortar, 
administrative personnel, sales tax reporting ... and headaches.

9.	Utilize leasing

The average computer reseller earns an extra three to four profit 
points on a lease as opposed to a sale on net 30 day terms. Most major 
leasing companies allow resellers to broker the lease rate. Every 
computer sold should be quoted on a monthly lease or on a net 30 day 
purchase option. Often a reseller is able to sell more if the buyer is 
able to stay within their capital budget parameters. In addition, 
leasing encourages add-ons and helps protect your customers from the 
competition.

8.	Charge more for constrained products

Remember 늡upply and demand back in Economics 101? When supply 
decreases, demand increases. Are you charging all your customers a 
standard mark-up? Customers will expect to pay more for products that 
are in short supply. When pricing out your proposals, make sure that 
the current industry-wide availability of the products are taken into 
consideration.

7.	Establish software solutions

There is more profit to be found in software than in hardware. 
Software solutions should be established for the industries that you 
are selling to. Seek out VARs who have the best software available. 
Determine if you can be authorized to sell that software in your local 
market. Have your staff trained and develop a profit margin split or 
finders fee commission with the software providers. Maintain a 
catalog by industry. It is often easier to lead with the software 
solution before selling the hardware. 

6.      Base commissions on collections 

Someone once said, 뉴 sale is not a sale until the invoice is 
collected. If this is true, why pay a full sales commission when the 
product ships? Consider paying partial commission at the time of 
shipment with the balance payable at the time of collection. Or, 
adjust the commissions monthly based on receivables that age out past 
a pre-determined time frame (i.e., 60 days). This will encourage your 
sales staff to provide better customer service and follow through 
after the sale. This, in turn, wi ll speed up your collections and 
cause customers to be happier with your performance.

5.	Sell peripherals

The profit margin on desktop computers is small. Make sure that your 
sales people add peripherals such as extra memory, multimedia kits, 
modems, docking stations, network interfaces, communication linkages, 
electronic personal organizers, etc. This is your opportunity to 
increase margins.

4.	Maximize soft dollars

Many manufacturers offer a variety of ways for you to redeem soft 
dollars. If you have the option, do not use your soft dollars for 
vacation travel or gifts. Attempt to work with your vendor 
representative to utilize soft dollars on avenues that will increase 
your sales, such as advertising, vendor-focused employees, special 
financing terms, etc.

3.	Utilize financing subsidies

Most of the major CPU manufacturers are still offering 30-day interest 
free financing subsidies through finance companies. Master resellers 
and distributors should be able to provide you with more attractive 
pricing when you purchase through a finance company because the 
manufacturer pays for carrying the receivables rather than your 
supplier. Make sure you negotiate your best deal when purchasing your 
CPUs by leveraging in the manufacturer subsidies and getting your best 
price.

2.	Sell services

There are excellent profits to be earned on the proper selling of 
services. The most popular are installation, training, support, 
technical services, configuration, extended warranties and repairs. 
Attempt to bundle these services whenever making a new hardware sale.

1.	Focus on emerging technology

Attempt to get in front of the emerging technologies. Those who were 
in the front end of networking are now in a much better position to 
serve their customers as networking continues to explode. Future 
technologies can be found in disaster planning, document imaging, 
voice/data technology, EDI, etc. Be prepared to exploit the 
appropriate opportunities. 

By focusing on any of the items on this Top 10 List, a savvy reseller 
should be able to increase his or her bottom line. Trying to 
accomplish them by yourself can be frustrating. Instead, challenge 
different members of your staff with one or two of the items on this 
list. Have them measure their results and present their 
accomplishments to you monthly or quarterly. Set goals and review 
accomplishments against those goals. And finally, do not forget to 
celebrate your successes with those who helped you accom plish them.

Whether and How to Successfully be a Reseller in the Global Marketplace


It뇹 no secret that the worldwide economy is exploding, particularly 
the Pacific Rim nations, led by Japan and the so-called Four Little 
Dragons  Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea. And, Thailand, 
Malaysia and Indonesia are not far behind. What is not so clear, 
however, is whether and how U.S. resellers, VARs and systems 
integrators should try to enter these and other expanding markets. 
After all, most domestic resellers have local or regional business. 
Why should they care what happens a dozen t ime zones away?

One answer is provided by George Colombo, president of Influence 
Technologies, a sales and marketing education company in Winter 
Springs, Fla. that consults with resellers and business owners: 늋ou 
don뇺 have to target international markets in order to be competing in 
the global marketplace. You don뇺 have to go out and look for that 
competition because it뇹 coming to look for you whether you like it or 
not. You have to view your business environment in terms of the global 
marketplace, even if it뇹 outside of what you perceive to be your 
existing boundaries. The fact is, you뇳l be competing against the same 
people here or there. The subject is worth the attention of VARs even 
if their focus is on Main Street."

Colombo뇹 advice is echoed by Roosevelt Giles, president of 
Information Management Systems Inc., a systems integration company in 
Atlanta that does a good deal of business overseas. 늆oo many VARs 
refuse to consider the global marketplace, Giles says. 늆hey prefer 
to believe they can continue to operate within a 50-mile radius, not 
realizing that the radius is slowly shrinking and that part of their 
competition is coming from overseas, either directly or indirectly. 
Part of the globalization of the reselling marketplace is that 
distance matters less and less. In other words, it is no longer 
possible to ignore or hide from the global marketplace. Many VARs and 
systems integrators will find that they must tackle it head-on if only 
to maintain their current position. Viewed more positively, foreign 
markets are a tremendous opportunity for resellers. The questions then 
become: how have these opportunities arisen, and how can resellers 
take advantage of them?

When Computer Systems Collide

Systems integration problems naturally arise in a booming economy, 
because every time one company buys another, there is a potential 
conflict between computer systems. Usually there is such an installed 
base, such a hefty capital investment at stake, that throwing out the 
existing equipment is not an immediate option. Rather, a way must be 
found to make these diverse systems work together, at least in the 
short-term. This is why every merger and acquisition overseas means 
more potential business for VARs in the United States if they want to 
go after it. 

Another reason for the growing importance of foreign markets is the 
oft-repeated observation that the center of gravity in the world of 
commerce and business continues to shift westward. It started in 
Europe, migrated to the United States and is now moving swiftly to the 
Pacific Rim. That뇹 a megatrend that shows no sign of slowing. Then 
again, as information technology penetrates foreign markets ever more 
deeply, systems that were largely developed in the West must be 
adapted to local conditions and standards that are often very 
different. 

Even such basic issues as differing standards for electrical voltage 
can greatly increase the need for systems integration expertise. 
Speaking of expertise, it is frequently in short supply in exactly 
those parts of the global marketplace where it is most needed. 

Referring especially to the Far East, Giles notes: 늆here are pockets 
of expertise, but many holes to fill and therefore lots of room for 
partnerships. One of the biggest trends is in the LAN marketplace, 
which is simply booming right now. Other than that, systems 
integrators face many of the same problems around the world as they do 
here. For instance, the demand for network services that the networks 
are not quite ready to handle, such as videoconferencing. So no matter 
where you look for business in the world, you뇳l encounter these 
녁leeding edge types of problems. 

Colombo suggests one reason why foreign customers may find it easier 
than U.S. ones to migrate to the newest technology: 뉼n some ways we 
suffer in this country because our infrastructure is more mature. 
Places like South America are much more able to absorb an emerging 
standard such as ISDN because it isn뇺 replacing anything; there뇹 
been nothing there before at all. There뇹 an old joke about why God 
was able to create the world in six days. The answer is that He didn뇺 
have an installed base he had to remain compatible with.

Getting the Business

늉e have two main ways of generating business in foreign markets, 
Giles says. 늂ne is through our partnerships with the vendors who want 
to work with us on a particular project overseas. The other is through 
becoming visible at trade shows. For example, we ran the 
Interoperability Booth at the recent Comdex. And we give a number of 
seminars at shows and conferences. Many foreign customers attend these 
shows and connect with us that way. 

These efforts have proven so successful for Information Management 
Systems over the years that the company is just now hiring its first 
Director of Sales after celebrating its 10th anniversary. Up until 
now, all sales have been handled by Giles and the information 
technology people working for him. According to Giles, even small VARs 
can leverage their experience if they have a solid niche of expertise 
to offer. What they have to do is make potential customers aware of 
them. That means spending significant dollars on trade shows, 
including some overseas events. If the price of entry is too steep, he 
suggests sharing the booth with other resellers in order to cut costs 
and present a bigger public image. As for seeking out partnerships 
with vendors doing business in foreign markets, the best strateg y is 
to send a profile of your company to the branch manager or regional 
manager of a vendor뇹 overseas office. Theyre looking for help in 
those markets, and will often be open to partnerships. You should also 
try to build relationships with local VARs and integrators in those 
markets. 

One obvious way to deal with a shrinking world is to get on the 
Information Superhighway. Any reseller who isn뇺 on the Internet is 
making a big mistake. Giles acknowledges, 늉ere now setting up our 
own Web server to generate and handle queries from around the globe. 
And were about to become Internet service providers as well, because 
so many of our customers are asking for it.

Special Problems & Partnerships

Doing business overseas entails certain unique difficulties, which in 
turn are best addressed by soliciting help from those locals with a 
vested interest. Simply getting the equipment to the customer can be a 
major problem. 뉼f the overseas customer is large enough, they have no 
problem securing hardware and software here and taking it back to 
their home office, Giles says. 뉵ut that뇹 not the majority of 
customers we deal with. 

Only the multinationals with foreign subsidiaries have a relatively 
easy time crossing borders with American-made equipment. For the most 
part, you need a sponsor within the country in which you want to do 
business. And just as you would here, you spec out the software and 
hardware requi rements for th e application. Then you look at sourcing 
and integrating the equipment. You뇳l find that many local firms in 
other countries are willing to partner with you for a share of the 
proceeds. They뇳l be glad to assist with the integration, too, because 
theyre looking to acquire those skills themselves. The local service 
provider wants to come up to speed, and that뇹 in the foreign 
customer뇹 interest because it뇹 always more convenient if service c 
an be based locally.

Partnering with foreign VARs is really not that different from 
establishing relationships with other VARs in the United States.  But 
whereas partnering with other VARs is simply one option among many 
here, when you are selling overseas you don뇺 have much choice  you 
have to partner to get and keep the business. It behooves you to 
recognize this reality. One special requirement of doing business 
overseas is to make sure that you communicate your agreements with the 
utmost clarity and put everything in writing. The deliverables between 
the parties, the expectations and the conditions should be spelled out 
even more clearly than you would do in this country. This is because 
foreign transactions are complicated not only by language barriers, 
but by cultural barriers. 

As Giles notes from his own experience, not all of this cross-cultural 
communication has to be face-to-face: 뉼 communicate a lot over the 
Internet, and that뇹 very cost-effective. Also, I뇼e done several 
videoconferences. When youre dealing with translations and accents, 
it helps to have a little body language to clarify things. We뇼e even 
conducted some of our technology seminars via videoconferencing. We 
can accomplish knowledge transfer without ever leaving home. You can 
also use videoconferences for product integration demos. A bonus is 
that by using all of the electronic communication methods available, 
I뇴 able to cut my foreign travel down to about once a month.

Staffing Excellence

If there is one significant difference between the global marketplace 
and the domestic marketplace, Giles, Colombo and other industry 
participants agree that it is in the level of excellence expected from 
a VAR뇹 staff. 늆o compete in the global marketplace, your people need 
to be fully certified by all the relevant vendors, and they뇼e got to 
be top-notch individuals, Giles emphasizes. 늉hen they go to another 
country, they have to be able to act on their own.  They뇳l be in a 
different time zone without the resources theyre used to at home. 
There뇹 no help line when things go wrong. So you need individuals who 
are self-starters, who can really dig in and solve problems. Foreign 
language skills are certain ly a plus, eve n though English is the 
second language in many places. Technically, your staff has to be 
very, very sharp. The global market will not tolerate marginal people, 
which is definitely something we could learn from them.

Giles prepares his engineers in his own test lab. If they claim to 
have a certain competence, he doesn뇺 merely take their word for it. 
He runs them through a number of scenarios in the lab to verify their 
skill level. He also mentors them properly; a more seasoned engineer 
will accompany a novice on his or her first few assignments overseas. 
Colombo agrees that staffing excellence is crucial in doing business 
globally. 

늋ou need people who are not merely technically suited, but culturally 
suited to working in many different environments, he says. 늋ou need 
to become comfortable with the sort of staff that global customers 
will be comfortable with. I hate to use the word because it뇹 been 
over-used and abused lately, but diversity is the key here.

뉹oreign language skills are essential, of course, but theyre not the 
be-all and end-all of diversity. Cultural norms differ widely from 
place to place, too. What뇹 appropriate business behavior in North 
America will not be right for South America, not to mention Europe and 
Asia. These differences affect everything from prospecting for 
business to fulfilling the contract, and it takes a degree of cultural 
awareness to recognize them, let alone deal with them.

Small World, Big Challenge

If, after weighing the pros and cons, you don뇺 think that pursuing 
the global marketplace fits in with your business plans, you should 
still keep abreast of these developments. 

Colombo tells why: 뉶ompetitors from around the world will be 
targeting your customers, so you뇫 better get ready to deal with it. 
Therefore, be aware that this will be part of the competitive mix, and 
keep your focus on those things that are of most value to your 
customers. How do you do that? The old mantra, 녑tay close to your 
customer, still holds true. If outsiders come looking for your 
customers, use your natural advantage  namely, that youre closer to 
the customer, which permits you to respond faster. 

뉿ook at companies like Dell or Gateway, for example. Both of them 
speak extensively about the competitive advantage they gain from being 
direct-wired to customers every day. They talk to end users 
constantly, and that closeness puts them ahead of the competition. 
Resellers, VARs and systems integrators have to start looking at their 
customers the same way, and taking advantage of the physical 
proximity, among other things. 늁or can we afford to ignore the 
electronic modes of communication that will give our competitors 
easier access to our customers. We need to be aware of those things 
and to use them wherever appropriate. But the main point is to 
capitalize on our natural advantages. We need to play to our strengths 
while shoring up any weaknesses. That way we can make it more 
difficult for competition to make headway on our own territory. I 
think this is the correct approach regardless of whether your market 
is defin ed geog raphically or by some particular niche.

Our final advice: embrace change, embrace diversity, be prepared for a 
long learning curve and be patient. You뇳l soon be playing in a global 
marketplace, so you뇫 best start thinking in these terms now, while 
there뇹 still time to choose your options.


늆o compete in the global marketplace, your people need to be fully 
certified by all the relevant vendors, and they뇼e got to be top-notch 
individuals.

<CENTER><H2>Seven Sales and Marketing Success Tips for Technology 
Resellers</H2>

<STRONG>Business Builders

By George W. Colombo</STRONG></CENTER>
<PRE>
                                      
As the 21st century races toward us, it is clear that the sales and 
marketing tools and techniques that you use successfully today will 
not be adequate to meet the challenges of tomorrow뇹 hypercompetitive 
business environment. If your reselling business is going to thrive in 
the upcoming century, you will need to stake out an unassailable 
position in the minds of your customers. 

The tools and techniques that you employ in your sales and marketing 
efforts will need to incorporate not only the customer intim acy of 
늗igh touch, but also the relentless effectiveness of 늗igh tech. 
Keeping this in mind, here are the top seven suggested approaches that 
can enable you to differentiate your business from the competition.  
Your skillful use of any one of these approaches can make all the 
difference in the world as you prepare your business to thrive in the 
challenging business environment of tomorrow.

BECOME AN EXPERT!

The selling process is infinitely easier when customers are coming to 
you rather than you having to pursue them. As a business owner or 
manager, one of the most effective ways that you can make this happen 
is to become visible in your marketplace as an 는xpert. If your 
market is primarily local, make yourself available to business 
organizations in your community as a speaker on technology issues. You 
will be amazed at how potential customers will seek you out after a 
presentation, press their business card s into your hand, and ask if 
you could possibly find the time to give them a call! 

Another tactic that you can use to position yourself as an expert is 
to write articles on business and technology for either your local 
newspaper or, if you are focusing on a vertical market, for trade 
publications in your target industry. You can extend the impact of 
anything you write by using reprints in your company뇹 standard 
marketing packet.

INVEST IN TECHNOLOGY 

Resellers salespeople often find themselves in the same situation as 
the cobbler뇹 kids who didn뇺 have any shoes! While the entire field 
of sales support hardware and software is exploding, as a result of 
advances in technology combined with the demands of a hypercompetitive 
marketplace, resellers salespeople are often sent out into the 
marketplace with little more than a Day-Timer notebook and a 
loose-leaf price list. If you have not yet provided your salespeople 
with technology to facilitate contact an d account management, 
electronic presentations, E-mail based customer communications, and 
centralized sales document administration, then stop whatever else you 
are doing right now and start planning to implement this important set 
of tools! Sales force automation technology enhances sales 
productivity and lowers your cost of selling. 

Moreover, as a technology reseller, it demonstrates to your customers 
that you don뇺 just 늢alk the talk, but you actually 능alk the walk. 
Please forgive the commercial, but I would be remiss if I did not 
mention that resellers who want to learn more about this topic can 
refer to my book, Sales Force Automation (McGraw-Hill, 1994).

ALIGN COMPENSATION WITH OBJECTIVES

There is a Golden Rule of Sales Management that is both obvious (in 
theory) and elusive (in practice): Salespeople do what they are 
compensated to do. The implications of this rule are clear. You need 
to make certain that your sales compensation structures are designed 
to support your management objectives. One VAR that I worked with 
provided a textbook example of how a misalignment in this area can 
create problems. This VAR (like everyone else in our industry) was 
struggling mightily to maintain his margins. Unfortunately, his sales 
commissions were paid on gross sales dollars. 

His constant exhortations at sales meetings about maintaining margins 
fell on unreceptive ears, since salespeople recognized that better 
margins would have little or no effect on their commission c hecks. 
This example is so blatant as to be laughable, but the principle 
applies in less obvious circumstances, as well. Do you want your 
salespeople to spend time on customer retention and customer 
satisfaction issues? Is your 늒onnect rate for service contracts 
important? How about your hardware to services ratio? If any of these 
areas need improvement, make sure that your compensation program is 
providing your salespeople with the blueprint they need to go after 
your strategic objectives.

INVEST IN CUSTOMER RETENTION
One of the most important facts of life for any business owner or 
manager is that repeat business is significantly more profitable than 
new business. In the computer industry, where the cost of customer 
acquisition is particularly high, this fact deserves special attention 
and consideration. In a marketplace that is more competitive than ever 
before, you need to build a fence around your existing (i.e., most 
profitable) customers.

Consider how you can follow the example of the airline industry and 
institute your own version of a 뉹requent Flier program. If you think 
about it, you can find ways to lavish all kinds of special attention 
on your regular customers. Depending on the nature of your business, 
there are many creative options you have to reward your regular 
customers: credit for free support time, regular maintenance checks 
and free upgrade installations. The important thing is to find an 
incentive that is meaningful to your regular customers. And remember 
that whatever you choose as your 뉹requent Flier reward, it will 
certainly cost significantly less than replacing a lost customer.

DEVELOP A MEDIA PLAN

Continuing with the theme of having customers come to you, the 
credibility of your business receives a tremendous boost every time it 
is mentioned in a newspaper or magazine. Publicity does not happen by 
accident. It is the result of a disciplined approach to contacting the 
media. Are you hiring a new sales manager? Have you recently taken on 
a new line of product? Have you or one of your employees completed a 
special vendor training program? Send out a press release and let the 
media know!

You should have a mailing list that is comprised of the media that 
your customers read or watch. Every significant event should then be 
communicated to those media by means of a concise, well-written press 
release. You will not get your story printed every time, but you will 
be surprised at how often you are successful. A residual benefit of 
regular media contact is that the media will begin to perceive you as 
a 늟layer, and will begin to call you for interviews when a 
technology story is breaking.

USE SEMINAR MARKETING

If you are taking the time to read this article, chances are good that 
you regard your business as more than a 늑ox pushing enterprise. 
Chances are also good that your business model calls for adding value 
to the products that you sell to your customers. The challenge is to 
educate your customers about what you are doing in order to translate 
added value into added margins. That is not always easy for your 
salespeople to do in a 15-minute sales presentation.

Sales seminars provide an excellent forum for explaining the value of 
your company and the products you sell. Moreover, in a reselling 
environment where cooperative marketing dollars are in short supply, 
seminars are a great vehicle for tapping into 늗idden marketing money 
from manufacturers. (Limited space prevents me from going into detail 
on this subject, but if you want to learn more about it, be sure to 
sit in on my presentation in August at the Breakaway Conference in New 
Orleans.)

PRODUCE A NEWSLETTER

If you are looking for a low-cost, high-impact way to keep your arms 
wrapped around your customers, consider publishing a quarterly or 
bi-monthly newsletter. The resellers I know who are doing this 
maintain that it is the single most effective marketing tool in their 
arsenal.

A newsletter combines the advantages of several of the approaches 
mentioned above. It allows you to subtlely position yourself as an 
expert, adding immeasurably to your company뇹 credibility. It also 
gives you an opportunity to provide your customers with information 
about your company, its products, and its services that would be 
difficult to communicate otherwise.

If you decide to produce a newsletter, remember that a low-key 
approach works best. If your customers perceive that your newsletter 
is really an infomercial in disguise, it will wind up in their 
circular file, unwanted and unread. If, on the other hand, you put 
together a newsletter with genuine value, you will be astonished at 
how quickly your customers come to rely on it for information.

A well conceived newsletter can be your single most effective tool for 
staying close to your customers and positioning your business 
effectively in their minds.

<CENTER><H2>Profit Opportunities On the Internet: Ten Information 
Superhighway Strategies for Resellers</H2></CENTER>

<CENTER><STRONG>By Kurt Luchs</STRONG></CENTER>
<PRE>


Almost in spite of the hype, the information superhighway and its most 
visible components, the Internet and the World Wide Web, have truly 
taken off this year as never before. Seemingly every other computer 
book published these days explains either how to get on the Internet, 
or how to locate other Web surfers of like mind (be they lovers of 
model airplanes or Monty Python), or how individuals and companies can 
take advantage of this new market and its new mode of marketing. At 
last count there were 8,476,5 29 of these  beginner-orientated books, 
so we won뇺 add to that mountain of paper. With a few exceptions, 
we뇳l assume youre already on the Net and are familiar with the 
basics.

So far, however, there has been precious little on the subject 
addressed to resellers and where they fit into this picture from a 
business perspective. Yet the Internet represents one of the greatest 
profit opportunities of the 90s for resellers, VARs and systems 
integrators. Following are 10 Internet-related services resellers can 
offer to their existing customers or use to gain new customers. Many 
of these are short-term opportunities that spring from the newness of 
the technology. 

(Thanks to Donald J. H olmgren and Bruce A. Vojak, owners of UES Press 
in Bloomingdale, Ill., for their insights. See the accompanying 
sidebar for more information.)

INSTALL AND CONFIGURE THE SOFTWARE

At one level, aside from the technical complexities, the Internet is 
just one more service that a VAR can offer his or her existing 
customer base. Most resellers are familiar with installing NetWare or 
LAN Manager, but the Internet requires a different protocol. There are 
some arcane details that most customers won뇺 want to deal with. If 
you have a good relationship with an Internet service provider and can 
offer the whole package, including setting up an IP address, this 
service will interest many business customers. 

Most larger companies will have in-house Internet experts, so this is 
more for the small to mid-sized firms. One exception might be a larger 
company that has multiple platforms or a large LAN, where getting TCP 
and NetWare to run simultaneously can be difficult. Larger firms in 
this situation might prefer to outsource Internet consulting or 
implementation. Even when a company is on the Internet, access is 
usually limited. Resellers may have an opportunity to se rvice those 
departments that aren뇺 getting Int ernet privileges.

CONSULT INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS 

This means performing an Internet needs analysis for your client and 
making the appropriate recommendations. To do this successfully, of 
course, you must be intimately familiar with both your customer뇹 
business and the bewildering variety of Internet service providers. 
You gain an additional advantage here if you are set up as an Internet 
service provider yourself and can bid on the services you recommend.

TRACK THE COMPETITION 

Almost all companies will have a presence on the Internet eventually. 
But if none of your customer뇹 competitors are on it yet, or even 
intend to be, there may be no market advantage in connecting right 
now. You can still provide an essential service by keeping an eye on 
the competition and letting your customer know when it is time to jump 
in. If you surf the Internet for many clients, you can realize the 
cost efficiencies needed to make this a profitable service. 

PROVIDE INFORMATION SEARCHES

While this may be a time-consuming service for resellers to provide, 
it is also one sure to be in demand. The amount of information 
available on the Net is staggering. Access time is usually quick, but 
only if you know what youre looking for and where to find it. 
Resellers who are constant Internet surfers will develop a skill they 
can offer to customers who are novices or simply don뇺 have the time 
for complex searches.

There is another possibility here. The biggest single complaint of 
Internet users is the difficulty of locating addresses. You could 
specialize by becoming an expert in finding user addresses for a 
particular market niche or industry. You could then develop and sell 
CD-ROM databases of industry or market-specific phone numbers and 
addresses on the Internet.

OFFER INTERNET TRAINING AND SEMINARS

This service can include any type or level of Internet training, from 
an overview of the technology and what it means for businesses, to 
training a customer뇹 in-house Web server maintenance personnel at a 
high technical level. The first is broadly applicable to all managers 
and executives who realize they have to deal with this topic. It could 
be a canny way to get your foot in the door to sell more extensive 
Internet services. Numerous Internet guides offer starting points for 
such training. However, you could best leverage your expertise by 
creating training materials specifically geared to the market niche of 
your customer base.

PROVIDE HOME PAGE SERVICES

There are two aspects to this strategy: setting up and maintaining 
home pages for clients; and using home pages to gather market 
information for clients. A home page is a firm뇹 graphical entry point 
on the Internet뇹 World Wide Web (a.k.a WWW, or Web for short). The 
Web is a collection of computers and networks linked in cyberspace, 
that can be accessed with MOSAIC or similar Web browsers. Documents on 
a Web server are written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which 
looks just like a help file in a Wind ows or Macintosh software 
application. Through HTML, Web documents can contain links to other 
documents on other servers. As the hottest item on the Internet, 
getting onto the Web is sure to be one of the most frequent requests 
from your clients. They뇳l want you to set up a classy home page for 
them. You can offer this service whether you have your own 
high-performance link to the Internet, or go through a major service 
provider. 

Some companies use home pages as interactive ads. Others use them for 
technical support. A home page is also a good way to graphically index 
your information on the Internet. Setting up that kind of home page 
requires programming knowledge that many potential Internet users 
don뇺 have and don뇺 wish to acquire. Remember: if you set up a home 
page for one client, you can adapt it for another client and generate 
repeat sales. Recent advances enable some Web pages to make two-way 
transfers of information. Data encryption and security measures are 
vital to this market, and are another service that resellers can 
provide.

BECOME A SERVICE PROVIDER

This, again, entails two separate strategies. You can either:  buy 
blocks of time from the major providers and resell them; or set up a 
full-scale service from scratch. The first option might make sense if 
youre looking to service at least a 50-user node. You would market 
the service package and let a service provider handle the actual 
account maintenance. This might not be a money-maker so much as a 
distinctive value-added service you can offer your customers. In its 
simplest form, one employee could handle it. Otherwise, you should 
plan on at least two full-timers to maintain such a service.

SET UP A WEB SERVER FOR YOUR CLIENTS

You only need to consider putting up your own Web server if youre 
giving so much data to Internet users that a regular service provider 
isn뇺 interested in you because you뇳l just bog his system down. If 
youre already knowledgeable and have the necessary infrastructure, 
setting up on your own can be a good bet. Otherwise, it takes a 
sizable investment in money and effort. It뇹 a major step up from 
writing a home page to running a Web server. Web browsers like Mosaic 
are only the client piece of the client /server software. The server 
side is the expensive one because it뇹 mostly Unix-based. That means 
more expensive hardware and software, as well as more costly 
maintenance. In short, this is not a low-risk strategy, but one that 
requires serious cost-benefit analysis.

DEVELOP CUSTOM DATABASES

CD-ROM recorders are finally becoming affordable for the average 
reseller. You can get one for $2,500 these days, and the price keeps 
dropping. One reason for this profit strategy is the congestion on the 
more popular areas of the Web. CD-ROMs make sense for many of these 
areas, especially the ones that don뇺 require daily updates to be 
useful. There will be a market for culling these most often accessed 
Web collections and selling them on disc. Corporate users tend to 
forget that the Web software doesn뇺 n eed the Internet to run; it뇳l 
run on any local area network providing you don뇺 try to go across 
servers. In fact, making clients aware of the uses for the Web 
software on their own LANs is a service opportunity in itself. 

PREPARE FOR THE NEXT WAVE OF ISDN

ISDN refers to Integrated Services Digital Network. This is the 
digital phone line revolution that will soon change the way we receive 
and use information, both in our homes and at our businesses. ISDN is 
a three-in-one phone line for users: two high-speed digital lines and 
one slower analog line. The two digital lines can be combined into one 
super-fast line for connecting to the Internet, among other things, or 
they can be used separately. The analog line remains free for phone or 
fax  use.

The higher rate of data transfer speed that ISDN makes possible will 
attract a host of digital information service providers. The basic 
impact will be more access and faster access to the Internet by home 
users, making the whole market bigger for resellers. Expect a 
transition period, however, when ISDN is a luxury beyond the reach of 
most homeowners or small businesses.

ISDN will make more feasible some rather jerky, slow video, and some 
fairly good quality audio on the Internet. Video or audio file 
transfers will still not be very speedy, but will certainly be faster. 
A few enterprising cable TV companies are already providing direct 
Internet access via their own high-speed lines at remarkably low cost 
around $10 per month.

Could resellers partner with phone companies or cable companies to 
offer some of these services jointly? Perhaps. On a related note, 
computer network operators are starting to give phone companies a run 
for their money by offering long distance phone service on their 
low-cost computer lines. In this, as in all other free enterprise, 
competition between suppliers is producing the greatest benefits for 
consumers.

A Hot-Picks List for Cruising the Internet 

As noted earlier, there are countless introductory guides to the 
Internet that can be purchased at any bookstore. To our knowledge, 
though, only one book concentrates on basic business concerns related 
to the Internet. It also happens to be the only overview available in 
both print and audio versions.

An Executive Briefing on the Internet and the Information 
Superhighway, by Donald J. Holmgren and Bruce A. Vojak, is exactly 
what the title implies: a concise tour of the subject from a business 
perspective. This is information you should have if youre considering 
adding the Internet to your menu of customer services. It would also 
be an effective way to educate your customers about the benefits of 
the Internet. The audio portion consists of two 50-minute tapes with 
an informal dialog between the co-author s, covering everything from 
Internet history and terminology to using the net to achieve 
competitive advantage or maintain competitive position. Also included 
is a discussion of Internet risks, such as security, information 
control, and other issues. The accompanying 88-page book is a 
transcript of the dialog, plus a glossary and reference section. The 
combination book and audio package (they are not sold separately) 
costs $39.95, including postage and handling. There is a toll-free 
number for credit card orders, 800-879-4214; or you can send a check 
or money order to: BookCrafters Distribution Center, P.O. Box 370, 615 
Industrial Dr., Chelsea, MI 48118. Illinois residents should add 6.75% 
sales tax. 

The best technical references for Internet service 
providers are published by OReilly & Associates, Inc. You might start 
with Managing Internet Information Services, by Cricket Liu, Jerry 
Peek, Russ Jones, Bryan Buus and Adrian Nye. This 630-page volume will 
enable anyone with a suitable computer and Internet connection to 
become an Internet publisher. Cost is $29.95. The book can be ordered 
by phone (800-889-8969), fax (707-829-0104), E-mail (order@ora.com) or 
늡nail mail (OReilly & Associates , Inc., 10 3A Morris St.,

Tired of hassling with those multi-part warranty forms? Have you been 
wondering why your computer can뇺 be a substitute for your pencil in 
filling out warranty claims? 

Well, stop wondering and let SoftWARR do the work! What is SoftWARR?

SoftWARR is an easy-to-use, time saving warranty claim printing and 
tracking program developed by Electronic Commerce Solutions under the 
direction of the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA). 
SoftWARR takes the hassle out of warranty claims processing. The 
program walks you through the standard claim form with a series of 
simple, fill-in-the-blank screens that capture the necessary 
information needed to quickly get reimbursed for your warranty work. 
Most major manufacturers such as Apple Computer, Compaq, IBM, H-P, 
Epson, Okidata and Toshiba accept CompTIA claim forms.

Warranty Claims Made Easy

All necessary data is displayed on your screen at the stroke of a key. 
No more hunting through manufacturers manuals for failure codes or 
rummaging through the notes stuck to your wall, looking for that new 
technician뇹 certification number. Once you have filled in the blanks, 
you can generate the form on a laser printer or use a dot matrix 
printer to print the information on the standard CompTIA form. Save 
Time!

*       No more handwritten forms
*       No more repetitive entry of standard information
*       Speeds up vendor payment cycle

Eliminate Errors!

*       Provides auto selection of CompTIA failure and transaction codes
*       Ensures required fields are completed

Save Money!

*       Creates forms on plain paper
*       Saves time and money with faster form completion
*       Reduces vendor rejections

SoftWARR retains each claim뇹 data for future use. If an individual 
claim form is damaged, lost in the mail, or 늜issing in action, you 
can generate duplicate copies with a few simple keystrokes. In 
addition, SoftWARR keeps track of dealer authorization and technician 
certification numbers. As you hire new technicians or upgrade their 
skills, you can add their certification numbers to SoftWARR뇹 
technician table. These codes are then automatically selected as you 
fill in the form on your computer screen.

System Requirements

*       MS DOS 3.3 or higher, or Windows 3.1
*       2MB RAM
*       VGA monitor
*       Hard disk

(Macintosh version will be available by the end of 1994.)

<H2>How to Make the Right Connections and</H2>
<H2>Find a Reputable Computer Reseller</H2></CENTER>

<STRONG>The Expectations....</STRONG><BR><BR>
Consumers  whether in a home office or a small business  need to choose 
their resellers wisely if they wish to purchase a computer system that 
will serve them now and be capable of serving them in the near future.
<BR><BR>
If you are in the market to buy a desktop or personal computer for your 
business, it is important that you find a reputable reseller to meet 
your needs.  You should first establish what it is you want the reseller 
to do for you, and then shop for the reseller who can best meet those 
requirements.<BR><BR>
It may be useful to create a list of "expectations" you have for the 
reseller you are considering. For example, will you need training, 
service and support assistance?  If so, then you need to consider a 
reseller who can guarantee that assistance. What kind of warranty 
service will you require?  Determine what warranty service is available 
from the reseller you are considering, as well as what service will be 
available after the warranty expires. How important is price? If it 
is a very important consideration, then you may have to eliminate service 
from your expectations list to lower the cost. Once you have completed 
your list, you should have a better idea of the reseller who may be right 
for you.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>What is a computer reseller?</STRONG><BR><BR>
Like computers, there are different types of computer resellers. 
The computer reseller from which you purchase your computer, peripherals 
and software may be known by a variety of labels, including: dealer, 
VAD (value added dealer), VAR (value added reseller), systems integrator, 
computer superstore, and retailer. One type may suit your needs better 
than another, since the service and support for your computer system and 
its components may vary from reseller to reseller.<BR><BR>
Due to the rapid pace of change in the computer industry, most reseller 
organizations tend to be a blend of several of the types listed below:<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Systems Integrators</STRONG> (SIs) provide the highest level of integration support and 
service. They understand what terms such as technical assessments, 
requirement analysis, and data modeling mean, and have the resources 
to integrate different types of computer environments. They generally do not resell 
hardware. If they do, they only deal with hardware components for 
very large accounts.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Network Systems Integrators</STRONG> (NSIs) usually provide hardware 
integration products and services  frequently across multiple platforms such 
as DOS, Windows, Macintosh, UNIX, without applications support.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Network Consulting Organizations</STRONG> fit in between SIs and NSIs. 
They generally do not resell products, but provide consulting services 
such as network design, product testing, and system requirements analysis. 
These kinds of companies usually do not get involved with applications 
development, but can provide a high level of impartial information.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Value-Added Resellers</STRONG> (VARs) usually provide a large variety 
of products with a certain level of support to their customers. They often 
serve as the defacto "systems integrator" for small businesses.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Value-Added Dealers</STRONG> (VADs) resell hardware, software and peripherals, 
and also provide a minimum level of telephone or on-site support.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Retailers and Computer Superstores</STRONG> are organizations that sell 
computers and computer-related products in stores.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Mail Order Companies</STRONG> sell computer systems, software and components 
through catalogs.<BR><HR>

<CENTER><H2>Selecting a Reseller</H2></CENTER>
There are a myriad of resellers from which to choose, ranging from 
mega-stores carrying dozens of brands of computer hardware and software, 
to smaller dealers that carry only one or two brands. <BR><BR>
When shopping for a reseller be sure to obtain the salesperson's name 
and make note of the date that you talked to this person, in case there 
is a difference in the equipment and service that you actually received 
from the reseller and what you expected to receive. Most resellers are 
willing to listen to meaningful complaints and address them directly to 
your satisfaction. Being able to articulate what you expected to 
receive from the reseller, and when, may help you in getting a 
satisfactory resolution of your claim.<BR><BR>
<BR>
Following is a "checklist" to help you in selecting a reputable reseller:<MENU>
<LI> Longevity in the Marketplace. If a reseller is well-established 
in the business community, it is more likely that the company will be around to handle your future questions, service needs, and upgrade plans.  Ask how long the company has been in business.	  Reference Checks.  Can the reseller provide a list of satisfied customer references?  Contact your local Better Business Bureau for a reliability report on the company.
<BR><LI> Quality of Service. Do the firm's stated marketing mottoes match the services they actually provide?  Matching the reseller's specialties to your business needs is important in developing a good working relationship.  For example, all companies specializing in local area network-related services are not the same.  Will you require a lot of assistance and support or a little?  Look for pre-sales support (consulting), implementation (installation) support, and after-sales support.
Be sure that you can obtain service for the software and hardware equipment you are purchasing both when it is under warranty and when the warranty expires.
Remember, some companies, like superstores, concentrate on sales volume, while others focus on being service providers.  Be aware of the differences and the consequences.
<BR><LI> Manufacturer Authorizations.  Has the reseller installed and/or does it use the specific kinds of equipment that are being proposed to you?  Does the reseller have training on the equipment being proposed?  Does the VAR/SI have specific vendor authorizations, certifications or designations?  Remember that certifications and/or authorizations are merely one of many indicators of capability when selecting a reseller to meet your needs.  Before authorizing resellers to distribute their products, major manufacturers have generally checked the reseller out and the authorization medallions are a sign of confidence in the reseller.  Resellers have dealer numbers authorizing them to sell specific products.  If you do not see decals or certificates for these vendor authorizations, certifications or designations being displayed, ask the reseller.
<BR><LI> Certification. A reseller who has certified computer service technicians on staff is showing his/her commitment to computer service quality. A+ Certification is a widely-recognized identification that is received from the Computing Technology Industry  Association (CompTIA) after successfully passing a comprehensive testing battery that covers configuring, installing, diagnosing, repairing, upgrading, and maintaining microcomputers and associated technologies, as well as interaction with customers and safety practices.
<BR><LI> Support Questions.  How much of the system being configured do you want the reseller to support?  Can they support this platform with in-house personnel or by outsourcing?  If outsourcing, what is the reseller's relationship to the outside source?  What is your recourse if there is a problem with the part of the system or network being outsourced?
In the area of technical support, it is important to remember there is no such thing as "free" technical support.  Technical support is invariably tied into the cost of the computer.  Therefore, computer experts agree, if you are choosing a reseller on price alone, be aware that the trade-off may likely be reduced service.  Level of Rapport.  What will be the rapport level between the reseller's support personnel and the employees in your organization who will be dealing with each other?  An adversarial posture can cause problems within your company.   What kind of operator training will be available for your staff, and at what cost?
<BR><LI> Service. Does the reseller service equipment in-house or do they send it out?  Does the reseller come to you or must you take the computer in?
<BR><LI> Training. Can the reseller train you on the equipment or software on their premises?  Or do they contract with an independent training facility?
<BR><LI> Resources. Can the reseller commit the resources necessary to bring about the proposed solution in the time frame agreed upon?
<BR><LI> Extended manufacturer warranties. Many warranties are only for a one year period?  Can the reseller extend them?
<BR><LI> Outside Help. Can the reseller bring in vendor resources if necessary to complete the projects in the same timely fashion?
<BR><LI> Industry Commitment. Does the reseller actively participate in computer technology societies or associations, demonstrating the company's familiarity with developments in the computing and information technologies community at large? Look for evidence of participation and membership in computer industry organizations in the form of prominently displayed certificates, plaques and/or decals.</MENU>
<HR>
<CENTER><H2>Establishing A Relationship</H2></CENTER>
The computer you buy today will be replaced by a smaller, faster one tomorrow.  However, it does not necessarily mean your computer has to be replaced.  By establishing a relationship with your reseller, you can be assured the firm will help you select a computer that has the functionality you need so that the equipment can easily be updated in the future.
Be aware that buying the most up-to-date computer today is not the same as buying a computer with the functionality you may need for the future.  A reputable reseller can foresee future problems and help you choose the system that will serve you best now and in the years to come.<BR><BR>

When selecting or evaluating a computer reseller, remember to consider the following factors:<MENU>
<LI> service levels and quality
<BR><LI> technical expertise in advanced technology
<BR><LI> knowledge of application or network operating system software
<BR><LI>  depth of after-sale support</MENU>

Searching for help to solve your computing and information technology 
problems can be both expensive and time consuming. Computer technology 
associations can be instrumental in finding technically competent and 
savvy computer reseller professionals who can provide solutions to 
your specific information system and integration problems. For more 
information on selecting a computer reseller or for a list of 
A+ Authorized Service Centers near you, call the Computing Technology 
Industry Association at (708) 268-1818, ext. 301, or fax your request 
to (708) 268-1384. Contact your local Better Business Bureau to check 
on the reputability of a reseller that you are considering.<BR>
<HR>
<CENTER><H2>Computer Buyer's Checklist</H2></CENTER>

<STRONG>Computer Buyer's Checklist</STRONG><MENU><MENU>
<LI> Does the computer self-configure when first started?
<BR><LI> Does someone on your staff have to configure any of the elements of the system?
<BR><LI> What added software is bundled with the computer?  Are the version numbers of the bundled software current?
<BR><LI> Are all accessories easily labeled for connection?
<BR><LI> Do you have adequate space in which to set up your computer?
<BR><LI> Do you have a 3-wire "grounded" electrical outlet nearby to plug the PC into?
<BR><LI> If you are purchasing a modem with a computer, do you have a telephone outlet nearby?  Will the modem's telephone cord reach the outlet?
<BR><LI> Is there enough room to place the components on the designated work surface  with enough space for keyboards, mouse pads and monitor  or will extension cords be needed?
<BR><LI> Is there a (toll-free) telephone support line available for user assistance during and after normal business hours?
<BR><LI> Will additional electrical outlets be necessary?</MENU></MENU>

<STRONG>Computer Service Checklist</STRONG><MENU><MENU>
<LI> Should the machine be sent to the location where it was purchased for 
warranty service? If not, to what location should the machine be shipped?
<BR><LI> If  warranty service is performed on-site, for what duration or what warranty period is it performed?  Does this cover all of the components that are being purchased?
<BR><LI> After the warranty has expired, where can service be obtained?
<BR><LI> How much does the service policy cost, what does it cover, and what is the average response time for service?
<BR><LI> Are there any additional fees for emergency service?
<BR><LI> Can service  either warranty or non-warranty  be obtained from other service providers?
<BR><LI> Is the warranty void if the components are serviced in-house?
<BR><LI> Is the warranty void if additional components are added to the computer?
<BR><LI> Are any of the warranties transferable to other people if the 
computer is sold or given away?
<BR><LI> Does the reseller have loss insurance for all of the components of the computer?</MENU></MENU>

<H2>THE APPLE DEALERS SECTION AT WORK</H2></CENTER>
To serve as an arena for business opportunities, networking and information 
exchange has been the purpose and goal of the Apple Dealers Section (ADS) 
since its formation in 1988. Today, the Section (formerly known as the 
Apple Dealers Association) continues to provide a forum and means for 
communication among authorized Apple resellers, Apple Computer and third-party 
vendors. The Section establishes programs for conveying the collective view of 
its members to vendors, governmental agencies and the public.  Section members 
include independent resellers, independently-owned franchise affiliates and regional chains.
By representing a diverse cross section of resellers, the ADS is an alternative
source of valuable information for Apple Computer and third party Apple-focused 
vendors, as well as independent resellers who may not otherwise have a voice in 
the development of vendor strategies. <BR><BR>

A second major function of the Section is to provide its Apple reseller members with opportunities to network  as 
a group, as well as one-on-one and face-to-face.  Through this network, 
resellers can gain insight into business opportunities successfully developed by 
non-competing resellers. ADS also serves as a sounding board to evaluate and 
analyze the impact of policies and programs implemented by Apple Computer and 
Apple-focused third-party vendors.
<BR><HR>
<CENTER><H2>ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE APPLE DEALERS SECTION</H2></CENTER>
As a strong, independent organization, ADS has over time been able to 
influence and advise Apple Computer on changes to its corporate policies 
and strategies.  The group has also provided a perspective on the 
reseller relationship and how Apple Computer can leverage this for
mutual advantage.  Among the issues that the ADS has influenced are:<MENU>
<LI>	Pricing models and the development of a "level playing field"
<BR><LI>	Franchiser Affiliate programs
<BR><LI>	"Soft dollar" co-op/MDF programs
<BR><LI>	Channel conflicts
<BR><LI>	Product segmentation and differentiation
<BR><LI>	Apple contract/business plan procedures</MENU>

As Apple continues to evolve its long term strategies and business plan, 
the ADS is working to ensure:<MENU>
<LI>that the value of Apple reseller organizations is understood within Apple; and
<BR><LI>that ADS reseller members understand Apple's changing distribution 
model. In doing so, ADS assists both in adjusting  their business practices accordingly.</MENU>
WHAT YOU GET AS AN ADS MEMBER<BR>
The ADS is committed to providing information and bottom-line-related 
benefits to its members.  These include:<MENU>
<LI>The valuable ADA$ AppleLink on-line address.  ADA$ provides members across the country with a way to validate and exchange information.  Members may post listings about products they are trying to buy or sell, or gain feedback on Apple related issues.
<BR><LI>An "information pipeline", as well as "early warning" updates.  By participating in the bi-annual business meetings with Apple Computer Executives and leading Apple resellers, ADS members can learn about the direction of distribution strategies and programs that affect everyone's business.  Using this information, ADS resellers can better define their own roles.
<BR><LI>Participation in the annual ADS survey. THis research  gives insight into trends, promotions, product information and new business opportunities.
<BR><LI>A special quarterly Section newsletter.  This high-impact publication showcases the news and views of fellow resellers and vendors; it is also a place to share successes and air concerns.
<BR><LI>Executive Briefings by the ADS Board.  ADS Board of Directors meet quarterly with Apple Computer executives; the sense and substance of those meetings is disseminated in written communications to ADS members for their review.
<BR><LI>Participation in a community of resellers who face common issues and work together to influence their business environment, as well as respond and adjust to changing circumstances.
<BR><LI>And much more!</MENU>
<HR>
<CENTER><H2>History and Dues Structure</H2></CENTER>
Beginning in 1988 as the Apple Dealers Association, the organization was 
formed in response to the need of independent Apple dealers to match their 
collective significance against the attention being paid at that time by 
Apple Computer to nationally organized chains and franchises. The original 
core of the Association has evolved into a diverse array of independent, 
franchise and affiliated resellers. In 1994, the Apple Dealers Association 
became a self-sustaining section of the Computing Technology Industry 
Association (CompTIA).  Now known as the Apple Dealers Section, it currently 
has more than 1,300 members.<BR><BR>
CompTIA is a national not-for-profit association of more than 6,100 
computer resellers, manufacturers, distributors and associate members. 
Its mission is to foster high levels of professional competence and 
business ethics among its members and the industry. All ADS members 
are also members of CompTIA, which handles all of the Section's financial, 
legal and administrative functions.<BR><BR>
Reseller members of ADS pay annual dues of $150. 
Franchise organizations may join as Section Sponsors, entitling 
them to activate their entire reseller membership in ADS, for an 
annual fee of $10,000.  Vendors may join ADS to demonstrate their 
support of its goals for an annual fee of $3,000.
<BR><BR>

<HR><CENTER><H2>Who Are These Guys?</H2>
<H3>A Short CompTIA History</H2></CENTER>

That뇹 a question being asked about computer resellers and computer 
industry vendors with increasing frequency these days  as corporate 
end-user customers sort out the important Information Technology 
choices that affect their organizations. And, since we are often 
judged by the company we keep, your  membership in the Computing 
Technology Industry Association will identify you and your 
organization as computer industry professionals dedicated to 
excellence in providing computer systems, service and support.

Specifically, CompTIA (formerly ABCD: The Microcomputer Industry 
Association) is an organization of more than 6,180 full-service 
computer resellers, VARs, distributors and manufacturers in the United 
States and Canada. 

The diversity of the Computing Technology Industry Association 
membership parallels that found in the microcomputer industry as a 
whole. All members of CompTIA  computer hardware and software 
manufacturers, distributors, resellers and associates  are involved 
in some aspect of the sale, service and/or support of computer 
products and technologies. CompTIA members chalked up an impressive 
$50.5 billion in combined 1993 sales. And, according to the Santa 
Clara, Calif.-based InfoCorp, that will rise to about $75 billion by 
1998.

CompTIA뇹 reseller members, who are the heart of the Association, run 
the gamut from single location systems integrators with less than 
$500,000 in annual revenue to nationwide franchise groups with more 
than 600 locations and $500 million in annual revenue.

<HR><CENTER><H2>Who Are These Guys?</H2>
<H3>A Short CompTIA History</H2></CENTER>

That뇹 a question being asked about computer resellers and computer 
industry vendors with increasing frequency these days  as corporate 
end-user customers sort out the important Information Technology 
choices that affect their organizations. And, since we are often 
judged by the company we keep, your  membership in the Computing 
Technology Industry Association will identify you and your 
organization as computer industry professionals dedicated to 
excellence in providing computer systems, service and support.

Specifically, CompTIA (formerly ABCD: The Microcomputer Industry 
Association) is an organization of more than 6,180 full-service 
computer resellers, VARs, distributors and manufacturers in the United 
States and Canada. 

The diversity of the Computing Technology Industry Association 
membership parallels that found in the microcomputer industry as a 
whole. All members of CompTIA  computer hardware and software 
manufacturers, distributors, resellers and associates  are involved 
in some aspect of the sale, service and/or support of computer 
products and technologies. CompTIA members chalked up an impressive 
$50.5 billion in combined 1993 sales. And, according to the Santa 
Clara, Calif.-based InfoCorp, that will rise to about $75 billion by 
1998.

CompTIA뇹 reseller members, who are the heart of the Association, run 
the gamut from single location systems integrators with less than 
$500,000 in annual revenue to nationwide franchise groups with more 
than 600 locations and $500 million in annual revenue.

<HR>
<CENTER><H2>ASSOCIATION POLITICAL AGENDA</H2></CENTER>

Among the items that the Association intends to address in 1995 are the 
following. It is expected that this list is a 'living' document, which 
will be expanded to include other federal and state issues as they arise.
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Telecom Reform</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
The renewed push for telecommunications reform legislation is vitally 
important to all segments of our industry.  Some issues that this 
legislation address include:  1) Should local phone companies be allowed  
through a manufacturing subsidiary  to manufacture equipment that 
connects to a phone jack (PC, fax, modem), including the software that 
runs such equipment?;  2) Should the manufacturing subsidiary be allowed 
to use the phone company's abundant information on customers to target, 
advertise, sell, install, network, and maintain such equipment in direct 
competition with the computer reseller channel?;  3) Should cable companies 
retain a monopoly on the sale, lease, and distribution of set-top boxes?; 
and  4) Should electronic content be afforded the same 1st amendment 
protections as printed speech or should criminal penalties be assessed on 
individuals who "make available potentially lewd, indecent or harassing" 
communications?<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Action:</STRONG>  The Association will lobby the Congress on these 
issues, arguing that open competition is desirable to the extent that the 
transition from a regulated, monopolistic environment does not unfairly 
affect the already hyper-competitive microcomputer industry.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>FCC Certification</STRONG><BR><BR>
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a formal Notice of 
Proposed Rule Making on February 7, 1995.  Proposing that 
personal computers and personal computer peripherals be certified based on 
the manufacturer's or supplier's declaration of compliance, eliminating 
much of the bureaucratic red tap that often stymies or delays getting new 
products to market. Further, the FCC proposed that if individual components 
in computer equipment (CPU, power supply and case) are certified, additional 
testing of the completed assembly is not required.<BR>
<STRONG>Action:</STRONG>  After considerably study by the Public Policy 
Committee and its Technical Subcommittee, the Association submitted formal 
comments to the FCC supporting the general concept of streamlining the
authorization process.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Mail Order Issue</STRONG><BR><BR>
For the past several years, the Association has supported legislation that 
would authorize states to require mail order companies to collect and 
remit sales tax to the state to which product is delivered.  Testifying 
before the Senate Small Business Committee, the Association argued that 
the competitive advantage of mail order companies that do not collect sales 
tax is at least equal to the state's sales tax. The Association also 
argued that leveling the playing field would make the industry more 
competitive.<BR>
<STRONG>Action:</STRONG>  Senator Dale Bumpers (D-AR) has reintroduced a 
bill that would authorize states to require mail order companies to collect 
and remit sales tax to the state to which merchandise is ultimately 
delivered. Because of the bill's bipartisan support last year, the 
Association expects the bill will be considered by Committee although 
enactment is not guaranteed.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>National Information Infrastructure (NII)</STRONG><BR><BR>
The NII, or Information Superhighway, is a seamless web of communications 
networks piping information via various means (phone, cable, cellular, 
satellite, broadcast, electric power grid) utilizing various information 
appliances (PC, TV, PDA, notebook, cellular phone, fax). With the 
convergence of technologies comes the convergence of competing industries,
making involvement by federal and state government all but inevitable. A 
key question that the Association must address concerns the modern concept 
of "universal service."  For the past 60 years, universal service has meant 
that businesses and urban dwellers would subsidize phone service to rural 
areas where the cost of providing such services is higher. In the 21st 
century, what services are so essential to all Americans that the government 
has an affirmative responsibility to declare that all Americans must 
possess or have access to the services? To paraphrase a recent column in 
the Wall Street Journal, "Do Americans have an inalienable right to a 
computer, modem and the Internet?"
<BR><STRONG>Action:</STRONG>  A concept paper on the NII is being prepared 
by the Public Policy office of CompTIA.  Once approved, this concept paper 
will serve as the basis for the Association's political positions and 
strategies with respect to the NII.<BR><BR>

CTIA뇹 Weinberger Tells House Subcommittee</H1></CENTER><PRE>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

WASHINGTON, D.C.  Certain non-profit companies in particular, 
college bookstores  are using their tax exempt status to gain an 
unfair advantage in selling computers, Alan Weinberger, Public Policy 
Committee Chairman of the Computing Technology Industry Association, 
told the House Small Business Subcommittee on Procurement, Taxation 
and Tourism. The 12-year-old Association represents more than 3,000 
companies from all segments of the computer and information technology 
industries.

Weinberger recently testified before the House Subcommittee because, 
he said, 뉸xempt from certain taxes, these non-profit companies can 
sell computers and computer-related equipment for less than what a 
for-profit reseller can purchase the same equipment at wholesale.  
Except for their tax-exempt status, a for-profit computer reseller and 
a college bookstore are often exactly the same, Weinberger declared.  
뉴nd, we at CTIA believe, that if it walks like a duck and quacks like 
a duck, then it probably is a duck.  We also believe that all ducks 
should be taxed the same.  Weinberger is Chairman and CEO of The 
ASCII Group, Inc., a Bethesda, MD-based chain of independent computer 
resellers.

A long time member of the Computing Technology Industry Association, 
Weinberger had been authorized by the Board of Directors of the 
Association to address the impact of unfair competition on for-profit 
computer resellers.  He stressed that an open market is essential in 
the computer industry, which reinvents itself about every 18 months 
with new products, technologies, upgrades and services.

Weinberger went on to note that bookstores that sell computers often 
argue that they provide a unique and valuable service to students.  
But Weinberger asserted that it doesn뇺 stop there.  늅ales of 
computers are not limited to just students.  Faculty and staff are 
permitted to purchase the computers, as well.  And, in many cases, 
Weinberger continued,  a business that employs a student on a 
part-time basis can also purchase a computer through this indirect 
channel.  In essence, nearly anyone can buy a computer from a 
bookstore.

In his testimony, Weinberger gave the House Subcommittee several 
concrete examples of the impact of unfair competition because of the 
tax code loophole. According to Weinberger, one for profit computer 
reseller in Ann Arbor, MI, has been closed out of the retail market 
because of pricing pressures from the University of Michigan 
bookstore. Unable to compete with the bookstore, which is defacto the 
largest computer dealer in the area, the Ann Arbor reseller was forced 
to change its focus and now concentrates on sales and service to 
businesses and no longer maintains a storefront.

In another example cited by Weinberger in his testimony, a computer 
reseller saw sales plummet over 90% when the neighboring University of 
Kansas bookstore began selling computers.  Of the five resellers 
originally located near the University, only two remain in business.  
늉ith their price advantage, Weinberger stated, 늑ookstores can 
effectively eliminate competition and control the market.  That is 
certainly not good news for the consumer.  And, he went on to say, 
뉸very sale of a computer or computer-related equipment by a tax 
exempt bookstore reduces the income tax revenue stream from the for- 
profit businesses.

The hearings were called by Representative James Bilbray (D-Nevada), 
Chairman of the Subcommittee, to examine issues related to unfair 
competition. Although no specific legislation has yet been introduced 
to deal with this issue, CTIA뇹 Director of Public Policy, Andrew W. 
Dod, noted that it is important for the computer industry that 늢he 
Subcommittee continue to explore the issues related to unfair 
competition, in order to draft a possible legislative solution later 
this year.

Adds Voice to Digital Telephony Issue; Will Not Oppose New, Less 
Intrusive Legislation</H1></CENTER><PRE>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

LOMBARD, Ill.  In recognition of the legitimate needs of law 
enforcement agencies, the Computing Technology Industry Association 
(CompTIA) has indicated that it will not oppose the new, less 
intrusive Digital Telephony legislation introduced by Sen. Patrick 
Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. Don Edwards (D-Calif.).  Historically, the 
computer industry has a strong record of cooperation with such 
agencies.  Support for this bill, however, hinges on the current 
limitations and privacy protections included in the present version 
remaining in tact as the legislation proceeds through the Congress, 
according to Andrew Dod, CompTIA뇹 Director of Public Policy.

Originally, Dod explained, the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) 
had sought to require all communications and computer systems, 
including private networks, to be re-engineered and redesigned to 
facilitate interception of private messages (in an authorized, lawful 
wiretap).  The FBI뇹 proposal would have required the redesign or 
expensive alteration of: all PCs; local area networks in all 
businesses; public e-mail systems; all telephone switches; PBXs; high 
speed networks; and radio-based and cellular communications, as well 
as several other types of communications equipment.

Of particular importance, Dod stressed, is that the costs for the 
redesign and alteration would have been borne by those impacted by the 
legislation, not by the government. CompTIA뇹 Director of Public 
Policy also noted that previous drafts of the Digital Telephony 
legislation were vigorously opposed by the Association. In addition to 
the security and privacy issues raised by the original version of the 
bill, CompTIA was concerned about the adverse impact that such 
legislation would have on international trade.  It is likely, Dod 
declared, that consumers would have doubts about purchasing U.S.-made 
equipment that essentially contained a 늢rap door through which the 
FBI could easily enter.

According to Dod, the Leahy/Edwards bill is more narrow in scope than 
the previous FBI proposals.  For example, it does not apply to online 
communication and information services such as Internet providers, 
CompuServe, AOL, Prodigy and BBSs.  And, it also excludes private 
networks, PBXs and facilities that only interconnect 
telecommunications carriers or private networks.  In this way, Dod 
said, the bill satisfies CompTIA뇹 concerns about the impact on 
manufacturers of PCs and others who maintain and operate private 
networks, as well as the likely adverse impact on international trade.

Further, the Leahy/Edwards bill includes four important provisions and 
several new privacy protections that were not in previous 
FBI-sponsored proposals.  The new bill would:  a) allow the public to 
have access to information relating to the implementation of the bill; 
b) let industry define technical requirements and standards rather 
than the Attorney General; c) recognize that certain services may be 
untappable regardless of efforts to accommodate surveillance needs; 
and d) authorize $500 million to reimburse telecommunications carriers 
for bringing their networks into compliance with the bill. New privacy 
protections include: 1) expanded protection for transactional records; 
2) new protection for location-specific information available in 
cellular, PCS and other advanced networks; 3) no preclusion against 
the use of encryption; 4) law enforcement is precluded from having 
automated remote surveillance capability; and 5) wiretap access 
methods adopted must protect the privacy and security of each user뇹 
communication.

During the past year, CompTIA has been an active participant in a 
variety of discussions in the Congress and within various federal 
agencies concerning computer industry-related issues such as the 
National Information Infrastructure, telecommunications reform, the 
FBI digital telephony bill, tax fairness, fair competition, and the 
Clipper Chip.  Through these efforts, CompTIA has helped ensure that 
the effects of such legislation and regulations on computer industry 
manufacturers, distributors and resellers is well known.

Fairness in Interstate Sales</H1></CENTER><PRE>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

WASHINGTON, D.C.  The Computing Technology Industry Association, 
whose members recorded $50.5 billion in combined sales last year, has 
declared its support for the 늆ax Fairness for Main Street Business 
Act of 1994. Introduced by Senator Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.), the bill 
would authorize states to require any mail order business doing more 
than $3 million in annual sales or whose sales into any given state 
exceed $100,000 to collect and remit sales taxes to the state that is 
the final location to which the seller ships or delivers merchandise.

Currently, computer resellers and other 녌ain street businesses are 
at a competitive disadvantage because they are required to collect 
taxes on the goods they sell  while mail order companies are not 
required to do so. For example, Andrew Dod, CTIA뇹 Director of Public 
Policy, points out, 늘f a state sales tax rate is 7 percent, computer 
resellers are automatically at a 7 percent price disadvantage when 
compared to mail order companies. Passage of the Bumpers Bill would 
ensure a more level playing field for computer resellers and other 
녌ain street businesses.

Senator Bumpers noted in his introductory statement that the bill does 
not impose any new taxes, but instead improves the collection of 
existing state and local taxes. Dod noted that, according to a 1992 
report in State Tax Notes, the estimated uncollected taxes on 
interstate mail order sales for 1992 could have added $3.3 billion to 
state coffers.

Representative of the strong support that the bill has in the computer 
reseller community is Kenneth Krich, President and CEO of 
ComputerWare, which employs 160 people in nine stores in Northern 
California. Says Krich, 늃rofit margins in the highly competitive 
computer reseller business are razor thin. Mail order companies have 
garnered significant market share, in part, because they are not 
required to collect sales taxes from their out of state customers. As 
new technologies proliferate and more computer purchases are made via 
the telephone, television or computer modem, the inequality of the 
current system will worsen. An eroding retail customer base ultimately 
means less revenues to states to pay for education, roads and crime 
prevention.

The Bumpers Bill, which has bipartisan support, is in the Senate 
Finance Committee. The Senate Small Business Committee is scheduled to 
hold a hearing on the Bumpers Bill on April 13, 1994.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

LOMBARD, Ill.  With a longstanding history of championing 
professionalism and ethical business practices, the Computing 
Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) has announced its support 
for a rating system for all forms of interactive software games, 
including video games and computer-based software games.  The 
Association believes that all parents and other consumers should be 
accurately advised of the content of the games they intend to 
purchase.

늆he rewards of taking the lead in this area far outnumber those of 
plodding along with the crowd, commented CompTIA뇹 Director of Public 
Policy, Andrew Dod.  늇nless we in the computer industry take a 
leadership role and regulate ourselves, it is likely that certain 
members of the Congress will pursue legislation and impose a rating 
system on us. Dod noted that Sens. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and 
Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.) held several hearings over the past year that 
focused on the rights of parents and other consumers to be informed 
about a game뇹 content.  The Senators made their intentions clear and 
requested that a rating system be operational by the 1994 holiday 
season.

Toward that end, the Software Publishers Association (SPA) helped form 
the Computer Games Rating Working Group (CGR Working Group), a 
coalition of companies and associations that represents nearly 3,000 
developers and distributors of personal computer software.  This past 
July, the CGR Working Group proposed a rating system  based on the 
policy outlines of Sens. Lieberman and Kohl.  However, at the same 
time, several video game companies separately created the Interactive 
Digital Software Association (IDSA) and proposed a second, different 
rating system.

Despite good faith efforts by both groups, no agreement to combine the 
different rating systems has been reached, CompTIA뇹 Public Policy 
Director Andrew Dod stated.  At issue, Dod explained, is IDSA뇹 
intention to retain ownership of the trademarks of the ratings icons 
and the process by which ratings are determined.  For any rating 
system to be effective, CompTIA believes that it must be managed by an 
independent body, which is not controlled by any particular industry 
association.

Because a trade association exists to serve its members interests, 
Dod noted, merely 늘nsulating the ratings body within a group would 
undermine the validity of the rating system, create the appearance of 
favoritism, and potentially jeopardize its acceptance by consumers.  
For these reasons, Dod said, CompTIA favored the CGR Working Group뇹 
establishment of a separate corporation, called the Recreational 
Software Advisory Council (RSAC), to manage the rating system.

Dod went on to say that there are also concerns about the manner in 
which the IDSA would collect information from software publishers and 
on which the ratings would be based.  IDSA뇹 plan calls for using 
selected story boards, chosen by software publishers. RSAC뇹 process 
includes a detailed questionnaire that addresses the entire content of 
the game, as well as a disclosure statement that attests to the 
truthfulness of the answers and acknowledges penalties for misleading 
answers.

While CompTIA believes that the process spelled out by the RSAC is 
objective and will result in more accurate ratings on games, the 
Association understands that resellers will have to deal with two 
different sets of ratings icons.  뉼n any case, the Association 
encourages its reseller members to sell only games that carry a rating 
and to comply fully with CompTIA뇹 Code of Ethics, Dod declared.

RSAC has developed the following ratings categories for video and 
computer-based software games:  violence, nudity/sex and language. 
During the past year, CompTIA has been an active participant in a 
variety of discussions in the Congress and within various federal 
agencies concerning computer industry-related issues, such as the 
National Information Infrastructure, telecommunications reform, a 
software ratings system, tax fairness, fair competition, and the 
Clipper Chip.  Through these efforts, CompTIA has helped ensure that 
the effects of such legislation and regulations on computer industry 
manufacturers, distributors and resellers is well known.

Encryption Capabilities</H1></CENTER><PRE>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

WASHINGTON, D.C.  The Computing Technology Industry Association 
announced its support of pending legislation that would amend the 
Export Administration Act (EAA) and relax export controls on software 
with encryption capabilities. According to Andrew Dod, CTIA뇹 Director 
of Public Policy, current controls threaten the market position of 
computer hardware and software manufacturers internationally. 늃rompt 
action is needed so that U.S. companies can effectively compete with 
computer vendors in foreign countries that have less restrictive 
export controls, Dod said. The market for software with encryption 
capabilities  which protects computer data against unauthorized 
disclosure, theft or alteration  is estimated at between $6 billion 
and $9 billion annually.

Nathan Morton, Chairman of the Board of CTIA and President of 
Dallas-based Open Environment, commented, 뉴 realistic analysis of the 
current situation clearly demonstrates how U.S. companies are being 
locked out of competing in this specific, but growing, market not by 
artificial trade barriers of foreign countries but by artificial 
barriers in the U.S. CTIA supports Rep. Cantwell뇹 efforts because of 
the balanced and reasoned approach she has taken to promote trade 
while still protecting the national security.

Introduced by Rep. Maria Cantwell (D-WA), H.R. 3627 would amend the 
EAA by eliminating the need for export licenses for mass marketed 
software programs with encryption capabilities, except for those 
programs specifically designed for military use. In addition, the bill 
allows the government to deny an export license for any software if 
there is substantial evidence that it will be diverted or modified for 
military use or by terrorists or re-exported without the necessary 
U.S. authorization. Controls will  remain in effect on embargoed 
countries and on countries in which there are concerns about terrorist 
activities.

National security concerns prompted the enactment of export controls 
on software with encryption capabilities shortly after World War II; 
and they continued into the Cold War era. However, in today뇹 global 
economy, those concerns have nearly vanished. Further, the export 
controls have not been effective in restricting the availability of 
encryption abroad. In more than 20 countries, more than 200 mass 
market foreign commercial programs and products that offer encryption 
are being marketed. And, software with encryption capabilities can be 
purchased from most resellers in the U.S. These programs could be 
easily transferred abroad without being detected by the government.

The Computing Technology Industry Association (formerly ABCD: The 
Microcomputer Industry Association) is a national not-for-profit 
association of 3,000 microcomputer resellers, manufacturers, software 
publishers, distributors and service companies. Its mission is to 
foster high levels of professional competence and business ethics

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Lombard, Ill.  In its ongoing efforts to monitor and take positions 
on public policy issues that critically affect the health of the 
computer industry or its various segments, The Computing Technology 
Industry Association (formerly ABCD: The Microcomputer Industry 
Association) announced that it actively supports the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). As an association representing more than 
3,000 leading companies from all sectors of the computer industry, 
CTIA believes that NAFTA will significantly benefit the industry in 
several ways, including the areas of tariffs, intellectual property, 
investment and services. Therefore, CTIA strongly urges Congress to 
approve NAFTA.

Tariffs 

NAFTA focuses on reducing the high Mexican tariffs now being 
collected on computers and computer parts. Computers and computer 
parts are currently subject to Mexican tariffs of 10%, 15%, and 20%, 
while the U.S. tariffs on the same products are 0% and 3.9%. 
Elimination of these tariffs will help to level the business playing 
field and open up the Mexican market. This can increase the flow of 
exports to Mexico and allow our industry to compete even more 
successfully in Mexico, our nation뇹 third largest trading partner.

Intellectual Property 

In addition, NAFTA codifies and solidifies significant improvements to 
Mexican law that protect intellectual property, such as patents, 
trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. Protecting intellectual 
property  which is of critical importance to the computer industry  
is essential to our industry뇹 ability to compete internationally. The 
computer industry spends billions of dollars each year on research and 
development for new products and services. NAFTA would substantially 
curtail the misappropriation of intellectual property in Mexico.

Investment

In the investment arena, NAFTA removes significant barriers and 
prohibits discrimination against U.S. companies. It was only a few 
years ago that Mexico closed its borders to computer imports and 
required local manufacturing for access to the Mexican computer 
market. Further, the companies that chose to manufacture in Mexico 
were required to export from Mexico and to obtain minimum 늛ocal 
content in manufacturing those products. NAFTA would prohibit import 
restrictions altogether, providing assurances of future market access 
for U.S. exports.

Services

Further, NAFTA expands on initiatives in the U.S./Canada Free Trade 
Agreement and the Uruguay Round discussions of GATT that provide for 
establishing rules governing trade in services. A significant portion 
of the computer industry뇹 revenues are dependent on the export of 
services. NAFTA will open up more opportunities for the export of 
telecommunications and data processing services, in particular.

In other news, John Venator, CTIA Executive Vice President and CEO, 
announced the appointment of Andrew Dod as the Association뇹 Director 
of Public Policy. Dod will represent CTIA before the U.S. Congress, 
state legislatures, and regulatory bodies. In addition, Dod is 
responsible for monitoring public policy issues, developing 
legislative strategies and lobbying.

Most recently Dod served as Director of the Manufacturers Council of 
the Charlotte (NC) Chamber of Commerce, overseeing that group뇹 
programs and lobbying efforts. Prior to that, Dod was with the Atlanta 
law firm of Powell, Goldstein, Frazer & Murphy as a Legislative 
Analyst. In that capacity, Dod launched the firm뇹 state legislative 
advocacy practice group. A 1987 graduate of Princeton University, Dod 
received the Lyman H. Atwater Prize in Politics for his thesis on 
Richard M. Nixon:  A Psychohistorical Portrait. In addition, Dod was 
awarded an Annenberg Fellowship to teach American politics and culture 
at the prestigious Eton college in England. During his tenure there, 
Dod lectured on American political theory, the powers of the modern 
American presidency, and the U.S. Constitution. Dod resides in 
Matthews, NC with his wife, Susie, and their daughter, Gracen.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Lombard, Ill.  A Michigan reseller and CTIA member told the U.S. 
Senate Small Business Committee that current federal law, which 
effectively exempts mail-order companies from collecting sales taxes 
on sales to out-of-state residents, is unfair to both 녌ain street 
businesses and state and local governments.

Jerry K. Engle, President of Computer Products and Resources, Inc., a 
MicroAge franchise in Grand Rapids, said, 뉶ompetition between 녌ain 
street businesses, like mine, and mail-order companies is not on a 
level playing field.  My company is required by law to collect 4 
percent (Michigan) sales tax on products we sell.  Out of state 
mail-order companies are not. One need not be a mathematician to 
conclude that 녌ain street businesses in Michigan are at a 4 percent 
price disadvantage to out-of-state mail-order companies right from the 
start.

Engle was recently invited to testify by Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.), 
Chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee and author of S. 1825, 
넶he Tax Fairness for Main Street Business Act of 1994. The bill 
would authorize states to require any mail-order company doing more 
than $3 million in annual sales or whose sales into any given state 
exceed $100,000 to collect and remit sales taxes to the state to which 
the merchandise is finally delivered.

State governments feel the pinch from the mail-order company 
exemption, too, Engle said. He estimated that his company had lost 
more than $2 million in large transaction sales to mail-order firms 
over the past three years.  If his company had closed those sales, 
Engle said, the State of Michigan would have collected approximately 
$80,000 in additional sales taxes.  In 1992, Michigan lost an 
estimated $93.9 million in uncollected sales tax revenue because of 
mail-order sales, Engle stated.  He pegged the potential lost revenue 
for all states in 1992 at approximately $3.3 billion.

뉹rom that lost revenue, not one single textbook will be purchased.  
Not one teacher will be hired.  And, at the risk of sounding 
self-serving, not one public school classroom or library computer 
system will be installed to hook into the often discussed information 
superhighway, Engle told the Senate Committee.  늁or will any of that 
lost revenue ever be allocated to hire another police officer to work 
the beat; to fund a substance abuse prevention program; or to initiate 
any early intervention programs for at-risk youth.

Engle is a member of the Computing Technology Industry Association, 
which has lobbied in support of the proposed bill.  The Computing 
Technology Industry Association (formerly ABCD: The Microcomputer 
Industry Association) is a national not-for-profit association of 
3,000 microcomputer resellers, manufacturers, software publishers,

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

LOMBARD, Ill.  In an effort to counteract any negative impact on the 
computer industry, the Computing Technology Industry Association 
(CompTIA) today filed an amicus curiae (friend of the court) brief 
with the U.S. Supreme Court in support of a petition for the court to 
hear the case of Computer Curriculum Corporation (CCC) vs. 
Instructional Systems, Inc. (ISI) and Deborah T. Poritz, Attorney 
General of the State of New Jersey.  The case before the Court 
addresses a Commerce Clause issue, relating to the power of states to 
regulate interstate commerce.  CompTIA is a national not-for-profit 
trade association representing more than 6,150 companies from all 
segments of the computer industry, including manufacturers, 
distributors, resellers and service companies.

In filing the brief, the Association urged the U.S. Supreme Court to 
hear this particular New Jersey  case because of its immediate impact 
on interstate commerce and computer industry distribution issues.  At 
stake is a particular Commerce Clause issue; whether or not a state 
may apply its franchise laws to prohibit commercial transactions that 
occur wholly outside the state's borders and prevent out-of-state 
suppliers, potentially forever, from changing their distribution 
practices in other states.  Explains CompTIA뇹 Director of Public 
Policy Andrew Dod, 늆he case addresses whether New Jersey should have 
the authority to regulate the distribution practices of a California 
company in states outside of New Jersey.  (A summary of the details 
of the case is attached to this release.)

Speaking on behalf of the Association, Barbara Faucett, CompTIA's 
Chairman said, 늂ur Association believes that to allow the Third 
Circuit Court뇹 decision to stand could have a significant and lasting 
negative impact on our entire industry.  Faucett went on to say, 늆he 
relevance of the case to our members centers on whether one state can 
have the power to dictate, regulate or control the distribution and 
selling practices of suppliers located in other states.  Faucett is 
Executive Director of LMB Microcomputers in Indianapolis, IN, a 
solutions-oriented computer reseller that specializes in desktop 
consulting and support services, training, graphics and media 
integration, as well as hardware, software and networking sales.

Echoing these remarks, Robert Powell, a member of CompTIA's Board and 
the Public Policy Committee that brought this case to the Board's 
attention, said, 뉼f the lower court's decision stands, my filing 
cabinet may be full of contracts that mean something totally different 
than what parties think they mean.  That's not good for the industry. 
Powell continued, 늉hen we looked at the facts in this case and the 
law as it has been interpreted by the courts, we quickly reached 
consensus that to file the brief was in the best interests of the 
entire channel.  Powell is Vice President of Complete Computing, a 
MicroAge affiliate in Little Rock, AR.

Dennis Hayes, Chairman of CompTIA's Public Policy Committee and 
President of Hayes Microcomputer Products in Atlanta, GA, said, 늆he 
channel demands flexibility from manufacturers, distributors and 
resellers.  We are all driven by new technologies that often require 
changes in distribution practices.  For one state to hold suppliers 
and vendors in other states hostage promotes the type of inefficiency 
of distribution that is in direct opposition to the efficient and 
profitable workings of our channel.

Specifically, the brief focuses on the extraterritorial application of 
the New Jersey Franchise Practices Act.  Director of Public Policy Dod 
said, 늂ur brief was narrowly drafted to address only the power of New 
Jersey to apply its franchise statute on companies doing business in 
other states.  We did not feel it was appropriate to address any other 
issue relating to the existence or lack of existence of a franchise in 
this particular case.

Faucett, stressing the value of an effective public policy effort 
within the Association  said, 뉶ompTIA has and will continue to 
monitor the political landscape to address issues that affect our 
industry.  Whether it is testifying before Congress, consulting with 
regulatory agencies or filing a brief with the Supreme Court, CompTIA 
will strive  on behalf of its entire membership  to be a strong and 
active voice heard by all levels of government.

During the past year, CompTIA has been an active participant in a 
variety of discussions in the Congress and within various federal 
agencies concerning computer industry-related issues, such as the 
National Information Infrastructure, telecommunications reform, a 
software ratings system, the FBI digital telephony bill, tax fairness, 
fair competition, and the Clipper Chip.  Through these efforts, 
CompTIA has helped ensure that the effects of such legislation and 
regulations on computer industry manufacturers, distributors and 
resellers is well known.

Details of the Case
INSTRUCTIONAL SYSTEMS, INC. 
V. COMPUTER CURRICULUM CORPORATION
and DEBORAH T. PORITZ, ATTORNEY GENERAL
OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY

Computer Curriculum Corporation (CCC) is a Delaware corporation 
headquartered in Palo Alto, CA.  It produces and markets an integrated 
learning system that uses computer technology to teach and monitor a 
student's progress in subjects such as math, reading, language and 
computer science education.

From 1974 to 1989, Instructional Systems, Inc. (ISI), a New Jersey 
corporation with its primary place of business in New Jersey, served 
as the exclusive distributor of products sold by CCC in the Northeast, 
this pursuant to a series of written agreements between the parties.

In 1984, the parties signed a "Reseller Agreement."  Under the 
contract, CCC appointed ISI as the exclusive "reseller" of CCC 
products to certain categories of customers in the following states:  
CT, DE, ME, MD, MA, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VT, and the District of Columbia.  
The contract provided that the agreement shall remain in effect until 
1989.

In 1988, ISI proposed to CCC that they extend the agreement for one 
more year.  CCC declined to do so on the grounds that CCC believed 
that ISI was spending a disproportionate amount of time selling in 
only three states: NJ, NY, and MA.  CCC believed that ISI was ignoring 
the other states.

Instead of allowing the 1984 Reseller Agreement to lapse when it 
expired, CCC offered ISI a new two year contract for the three states 
in which ISI had its major sales activity: NJ, NY, and MA.  CCC 
decided to take over the marketing of its products in the former ISI 
territory.

In August 1989, the parties agreed to a contract in which ISI would 
continue to sell in NJ, NY, and MA and CCC would begin to sell in the 
remaining states.  The same day that ISI executed the contract with 
CCC, ISI filed suit against CCC.  The complaint argued that the 1984 
Reseller Agreement contemplated renewal, that CCC had coerced ISI into 
signing the new contract, and that CCC had violated the New Jersey 
Franchise Practices Act (Act) by imposing unreasonable standards of 
performance on ISI.

CCC's response argued that if the Act could be used to enjoin it from 
terminating ISI's purported franchise in states other than NJ, the Act 
would violate the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  CCC 
argued that New Jersey has an interest in regulating only those 
franchise terminations that occur within it borders and has no 
jurisdiction in applying its law to other states.

New Jersey courts found that its law could be applied in this case, 
concluding that the state in which the franchisee is located has a 
significant policy interest in governing the relations between the 
parties.  The New Jersey courts also determined that the law of New 
Jersey would apply rather than the contractually agreed state law of 
California.

Washington</H1></CENTER><PRE>


For many within the channel, Washington is a place where insignificant 
issues are debated and faceless 늑ureaucrats enforce burdensome 
regulations.  But, more often than we dare to admit, many of the 
issues Congress addresses will have a direct impact on future market 
opportunities. 

The most recent victory for our industry may, over the next several 
years, be worth $80 billion in new consumer spending. Lobbying by 
members of the Association뇹 Public Policy Committee and CompTIA뇹 
Director of Public Policy, Andrew Dod, helped win passage of the 
Bryant Amendment, as part of the telecommunications deregulation 
legislation.  

Notes Dod, the question at issue is:  should the seven Baby Bells 
(Regional Bell Operating Companies, or RBOCs)  without first having 
to establish a separate arm뇹-length affiliate  be allowed to offer 
information services and become vertical VARs; be allowed to 
manufacture, distribute and resell telecommunications-related computer 
equipment; and be permitted to compete head-to-head with the reseller 
channel? Dod consulted with a variety of industry executives and 
lobbyists about the absence of 늡eparate affiliate language in the 
House telecom bill.  

Without this language, Dod explained, an RBOC could compete 
head-to-head with the reseller channel in both products and services, 
as well as subsidize its efforts with financial, information and 
technology resources.  The channel would have a difficult time 
competing on such on an unlevel playing field, Dod states. On May 20, 
CompTIA executives and members of the Georgia High Tech Alliance met 
with Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, for a briefing on his vision 
for renewing America. Following that meeting, Dennis Hayes, chairman 
and CEO of Hayes Microcomputer Products (Atlanta) and Chairman of 
CompTIA뇹 Public Policy Committee, asked why the House 
telecommunications legislation did not include any 늡eparate 
affiliate language.  

Gingrich responded that he was not aware that the affiliate language 
was so important and requested that a one-page position outline be 
prepared by May 22, for delivery to the Commerce Committee leadership. 
On behalf of the Association, Dod and Hayes presented a simple 
argument to Gingrich: 뉵ecause of their unique market position, the 
RBOCs could engage in potentially anti- competitive conduct in three 
particular areas if 늡eparate affiliate requirements are not included 
in the final legislation.  

Because of the RBOCs unique position, the areas of concern are:  
Financial Subsidies, Information Subsidies and Technology Subsidies. 
According to Dod, the concern centers around protecting CompTIA 
members from the cross-subsidization of resources from the phone 
holding company to one of the RBOCs new competitive business ventures. 
Rep. John Bryant (D-TX), a Commerce Committee member, authored the 
늡eparate affiliate amendment which, after intense lobbying and 
several changed Republican votes, won by a vote of 29-15. 

What did the Association and the industry win  and where do we go now? 
Assuming that both the full House and Senate pass their bills, the 
Conference Committee will be charged with ironing out the details and 
a final compromise, says Dod. In the shifting political sands of 
Washington, Dod explains, the Association and the industry have won 
the right to fight again for this issue in the Conference Committee. 
Sums up Dod, 뉼t뇹 a modified, limited, temporary victory on one vote 
on one provision in one bill in one House on one day in May.  And, 
more than $80 billion was at stake. 

The mechanics of lobbying in Washington rarely excite the passions of 
non-political professionals within the channel in the computer 
industry.  With legislation that will determine where and how some $80 
billion will be spent, however, Dod suspects that this will change. To 
join the fight for a level playing field for the channel, call

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

LOMBARD, Ill.  With a longstanding history of championing 
professionalism and ethical business practices, the Computing 
Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) has announced its support 
for a rating system for all forms of interactive software games, 
including video games and computer-based software games.  The 
Association believes that all parents and other consumers should be 
accurately advised of the content of the games they intend to 
purchase.

늆he rewards of taking the lead in this area far outnumber those of 
plodding along with the crowd, commented CompTIA뇹 Director of Public 
Policy, Andrew Dod.  늇nless we in the computer industry take a 
leadership role and regulate ourselves, it is likely that certain 
members of the Congress will pursue legislation and impose a rating 
system on us. Dod noted that Sens. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and 
Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.) held several hearings over the past year that 
focused on the rights of parents and other consumers to be informed 
about a game뇹 content.  The Senators made their intentions clear and 
requested that a rating system be operational by the 1994 holiday 
season.

Toward that end, the Software Publishers Association (SPA) helped form 
the Computer Games Rating Working Group (CGR Working Group), a 
coalition of companies and associations that represents nearly 3,000 
developers and distributors of personal computer software.  This past 
July, the CGR Working Group proposed a rating system  based on the 
policy outlines of Sens. Lieberman and Kohl.  However, at the same 
time, several video game companies separately created the Interactive 
Digital Software Association (IDSA) and proposed a second, different 
rating system.

Despite good faith efforts by both groups, no agreement to combine the 
different rating systems has been reached, CompTIA뇹 Public Policy 
Director Andrew Dod stated.  At issue, Dod explained, is IDSA뇹 
intention to retain ownership of the trademarks of the ratings icons 
and the process by which ratings are determined.  For any rating 
system to be effective, CompTIA believes that it must be managed by an 
independent body, which is not controlled by any particular industry 
association.

Because a trade association exists to serve its members interests, 
Dod noted, merely 늘nsulating the ratings body within a group would 
undermine the validity of the rating system, create the appearance of 
favoritism, and potentially jeopardize its acceptance by consumers.  
For these reasons, Dod said, CompTIA favored the CGR Working Group뇹 
establishment of a separate corporation, called the Recreational 
Software Advisory Council (RSAC), to manage the rating system.

Dod went on to say that there are also concerns about the manner in 
which the IDSA would collect information from software publishers and 
on which the ratings would be based.  IDSA뇹 plan calls for using 
selected story boards, chosen by software publishers. RSAC뇹 process 
includes a detailed questionnaire that addresses the entire content of 
the game, as well as a disclosure statement that attests to the 
truthfulness of the answers and acknowledges penalties for misleading 
answers.

While CompTIA believes that the process spelled out by the RSAC is 
objective and will result in more accurate ratings on games, the 
Association understands that resellers will have to deal with two 
different sets of ratings icons.  뉼n any case, the Association 
encourages its reseller members to sell only games that carry a rating 
and to comply fully with CompTIA뇹 Code of Ethics, Dod declared.

RSAC has developed the following ratings categories for video and 
computer-based software games:  violence, nudity/sex and language. 
During the past year, CompTIA has been an active participant in a 
variety of discussions in the Congress and within various federal 
agencies concerning computer industry-related issues, such as the 
National Information Infrastructure, telecommunications reform, a 
software ratings system, tax fairness, fair competition, and the 
Clipper Chip.  Through these efforts, CompTIA has helped ensure that 
the effects of such legislation and regulations on computer industry 
manufacturers, distributors and resellers is well known.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

WASHINGTON, D.C.  The Computing Technology Industry Association 
announced its support of pending legislation that would amend the 
Export Administration Act (EAA) and relax export controls on software 
with encryption capabilities. According to Andrew Dod, CTIA뇹 Director 
of Public Policy, current controls threaten the market position of 
computer hardware and software manufacturers internationally. 늃rompt 
action is needed so that U.S. companies can effectively compete with 
computer vendors in foreign countries that have less restrictive 
export controls, Dod said. The market for software with encryption 
capabilities  which protects computer data against unauthorized 
disclosure, theft or alteration  is estimated at between $6 billion 
and $9 billion annually.

Nathan Morton, Chairman of the Board of CTIA and President of 
Dallas-based Open Environment, commented, 뉴 realistic analysis of the 
current situation clearly demonstrates how U.S. companies are being 
locked out of competing in this specific, but growing, market not by 
artificial trade barriers of foreign countries but by artificial 
barriers in the U.S. CTIA supports Rep. Cantwell뇹 efforts because of 
the balanced and reasoned approach she has taken to promote trade 
while still protecting the national security.

Introduced by Rep. Maria Cantwell (D-WA), H.R. 3627 would amend the EAA by 
eliminating the need for export licenses for mass marketed software 
programs with encryption capabilities, except for those programs 
specifically designed for military use. In addition, the bill allows 
the government to deny an export license for any software if there is 
substantial evidence that it will be diverted or modified for military 
use or by terrorists or re-exported without the necessary U.S. 
authorization. Controls will  remain in effect on embargoed countries 
and on countries in which there are concerns about terrorist 
activities.

National security concerns prompted the enactment of export controls 
on software with encryption capabilities shortly after World War II; 
and they continued into the Cold War era. However, in today뇹 global 
economy, those concerns have nearly vanished. Further, the export 
controls have not been effective in restricting the availability of 
encryption abroad. In more than 20 countries, more than 200 mass 
market foreign commercial programs and products that offer encryption 
are being marketed. And, software with encryption capabilities can be 
purchased from most resellers in the U.S. These programs could be 
easily transferred abroad without being detected by the government.

The Computing Technology Industry Association (formerly ABCD: The

association of 3,000 microcomputer resellers, manufacturers, software 
publishers, distributors and service companies. Its mission is to 
foster high levels of professional competence and business ethics

<H2>ASAE Associations Advance America Honor Roll</H2>
<STRONG>
Three CompTIA Programs Make the 
'Associations Advance America' Honor Roll</STRONG></CENTER>
<PRE>
LOMBARD, Ill.  For the second year in a row, the Computing Technology 
Industry Association (CompTIA) has been elected to the 'Associations 
Advance America' Honor Roll for several of its outstanding programs.

The 'Associations Advance America' Awards, sponsored by the American 
Society of Association Executives (ASAE), recognize significant 
contributions made to society by associations in areas such as 
education, product and safety standards, codes of ethics, research 
and statistics, international activities and community service.

This year, CompTIA was recognized for its A+ Certification Program 
for computer service technicians, its Electronic Commerce (EDI/Bar Coding) 
efforts and the Association's Public Policy Education Program.

The A+ Certification Program sets industry standards through standardized, 
vendor-neutral testing of computer service technicians.  The multi-phase 
program benefits the computer industry by reducing the time and money 
technicians spend on vendor-required training.  In addition, corporate 
computing end users gain confidence in the service they receive from 
A+ Certified technicians.  More than 16,000 computer service technicians 
have become A+ Certified since the program was launched in July 1993.  
Solid proof that the A+ Certification program continues to gain momentum 
in the U.S. and Canada can also be found in the number of A+ Authorized 
Service Centers.  As of the end of July 1995, there were more than 1,110 
companies that showed their commitment to computer service excellence by 
becoming A+ Authorized Service Centers.  In order to be designated an 
A+ Authorized Service Center, an organization must have 50% or more of 
its computer service technicians become A+ Certified.

The Public Policy Education Program provides funds to brief legislators on 
how political issues affect the computer industry.  During the past year, 
CompTIA has been an active participant in a variety of discussions in the 
Congress and within various federal agencies concerning computer industry-
related issues, such as:  telecom reform, reform of FCC certification 
procedures, tax fairness, software with encryption capabilities, unfair 
competition, digital telephony, and a rating system for video and computer-
based software games.  Through these efforts, CompTIA has helped ensure 
that the effects of such legislation and regulations on computer industry 
manufacturers, distributors and resellers is well known.

Electronic Commerce is an essential element on today's business landscape. 
Electronic data interchange (EDI), a niche of electronic commerce, is the 
electronic transfer of data in a standardized format between dissimilar 
computer systems. It replaces paper, fax and phone transactions. Among its 
benefits are:  inventory tracking; elimination of the need to reprocess or 
re-enter data; paperwork, errors and delay can be eliminated; overhead 
costs can be reduced; sales may increase; and efficiency, convenience and 
accuracy can be greatly increased. EDI can be a critical factor in 
establishing the competitive advantage of one company over another in the 
same field. 

During the past three years, CompTIA has been instrumental in bringing 
electronic commerce to the computer industry. The Association took it to 
a global level this past March at CompTIA's first International EDI meeting 
in Paris where North American and European computing technology business 
partners were given an opportunity to better understand how to take EDI 
initiatives beyond their own borders.

For more information on CompTIA programs or the Association's member 
benefits and services, call Terri Baron at (708) 268-1818, ext. 312.

The Computing Technology Industry Association (formerly ABCD: The 
Microcomputer Industry Association) is a national not-for-profit 
association of more than 6,150 microcomputer resellers, manufacturers, 
software publishers, distributors and service companies. Its mission is to 
foster high levels of professional competence and business ethics among 
its members and the computer industry. Combined sales of CompTIA members 
account for 62% of all microcomputer sales in North America.

<CENTER><H1>Standards/Voluntary Guidelines</H1></CENTER>

<CENTER><H2>Recommended Voluntary Standards Policy for Return 
Authorization Hardware and Software Returns</H2></CENTER>

<PRE>

It is the goal of the computer industry to not only maximize profits 
but customer satisfaction as well. Other industries have addressed the 
product returns problem by allowing their customers to return product 
within a reasonable timeframe after purchase. Since manufacturers are 
in a better position than the reseller/distributor channel to absorb 
and/or recoup costs associated with product returns, they must provide 
the leadership and reasonable policies toward minimizing this problem. 
At the same time, resellers must ensure that their customers/end users 
are not only well-versed on product features, but are well-informed on 
the manufacturers product return guidelines as well.

The computer industry as a whole experiences several problems 
surrounding the return of product which are being addressed in this 
document by focusing on the following six categories.

A.	Inventory adjustments
B.	DOA returns
C.	Damage and packaging
D.	Opened and incomplete product
E.	Discontinued product
F.	Warranty replacement

Within the current environment, the disposition of these issues is 
often unique to each manufacturer. Such lack of standardization 
results in excessive overhead, customer dissatisfaction and general 
confusion in the channel. The following standards are proposed to 
address these concerns.

There must be some mechanism under the product return program that 
allows the originating entity to retain adequate records and allow for 
the verification of only discrepancies that may exist from the 
original quantity, quality and condition of merchandise for which the 
RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) was issued.

A.Inventory Adjustments (Stock Rebalancing): 

Resellers/distributors may return eligible products to the 
manufacturer or distributor, depending on the point of purchase. In 
consideration of frequent price changes and the generally consistent 
use of price protection within the industry, returns will be credited 
at the lower of the price paid or the current price. The recommended 
procedure is as follows:

     1. The manufacturer should issue a returns authorization to the 
          reseller/distributor within 48 hours of the return request.

     2. The reseller/distributor should return the product to the 
          authorized returns center within 30 days of receiving the 
          returns authorization. 

     3. The manufacturer should issue credit within 30 days of receipt 
          of returned product, less any expenses required to return 
          the goods to merchantable condition. The Master reseller 
          (franchiser)/distributor must, in turn, issue credit to its 
          retailers/Value Added Resellers/dealers within seven (7) 
          days of receipt of credit.

     4. Software returns by end-users are primarily due to one or both 
          of the following reasons:  
          a) The product does not meet their needs and expectations; 
          b) The product is technically incompatible with their 
               system. End users must be made aware by the resellers 
               of the problems and conditions associated with software 
               returns. Resellers/distributors must return product in 
               remarketable condition. Only those items authorized 
               will be accepted for return. 

     5. Software returns must be undamaged and in the original package 
          and contents must be complete.

     6. Transportation cost for all returns to the manufacturer must 
          be prepaid by the reseller/distributor.

Stock balancing:  It is noted that manufacturers that allow stock 
balancing have higher levels of reseller/distributor satisfaction. The 
guidelines would allow the reseller/distributor to return a percentage 
(10%) of the prior quarter뇹 purchases without a restocking fee. Stock 
Balancing RMA Request should be offset by a matching purchase order, 
where appropriate. Returns above the established guidelines would be 
subject to a pre-approved manufacturer뇹 restocking fee.

B. DOA product: This refers to products that are found (or perceived) 
to be 늓ead on arrival or defective before the customer has ever been 
able to realize the benefits of purchase.

     1. Manufacturers and resellers share the responsibility to 
          minimize the number of inappropriately categorized DOAs by 
          providing documentation inside the box and telephone support 
          to assist end-users with initial set up.

     2. There is agreement that 30 days from date of sale by a 
          reseller to the end user is a reasonable timeframe for 
          identifying a DOA product. There may be exceptions (i.e., 
          Christmas and major corporate projects) where more than 30 days 
          go by. These should be handled as exceptions

     3. Customers have no desire to interact with a manufacturer or 
          service center for the return for DOA product. Customers 
          prefer a 늞ne stop shop and as such should be able to 
          return any DOA eproduct to their reseller/retailer for full 
          credit or, if they desire, replacement.

     4. In turn, channel(s) require a clean process by which they can 
          return DOA products to the manufacturers.

     5. Manufacturers, in turn, can and should differentiate between 
          resellers that perform basic diagnosis to verify their 
          product is DOA and/or perform warranty repair work versus 
          those passing the 늒ustomer declared DOA back to the 
          manufacturer without inspection. The differentiation can be in 
          terms of either credits or charges. 

     6. Either way, the DOA/RMA process needs to be understood and 
          agreed to at contracting time, including specifying the timing and 
          return process including what documentation will be required.

C. Damaged returns: Product can incur box damage or real damage 
virtually anywhere in the channel. To minimize the loss potential, the 
following responsibilities are recommended: 

     1. Manufacturers are responsible for ensuring appropriate carton 
          and pallet protection to minimize in transition exposure.

     2. Risk of loss and 늓amage in transit are generally the 
          responsibility of the organization paying for the freight, 
          unless the terms of the sale are FOB reseller.

     3. Manufacturers should develop programs to send back product 
          with cosmetic damage regardless of the cost (for a fee).

     4. Where repackaging is not possible/practical, a reasonable 
          processing fee (e.g.: $10-50) would be charged for each unit 
          returned in damaged packages.

     5. To minimize the amount of hardware returns for box damage 
          only, manufacturers should submit standard guidelines 
          surrounding the ordering of new boxes and other necessary 
          repackaging materials. These guidelines should include as a 
          minimum: telephone contacts and numbers, models and part 
          numbers, pricing and delivery times for packaging.

     6. Repackaging materials should be provided to resellers at no 
          charge or minimum charge.

D. Opened product: This category involved products that have been 
opened and/or 늟owered up by either a reseller or end user and then 
found to be wrong or undesirable.

     1. Misorders, misunderstandings, buyers remorse and general 
          customer satisfaction can all result in perfectly good 
          products being returned to the point of purchase.

     2. In order to provide for timely identification of 늣sed 
          product in the resale channel, it is incumbent upon the 
          manufacturer to provide a mechanism to the reseller for 
          identification of used products and standardization of the 
          term 늕actory seal, i.e., internally sealed versus external 
          box seal.

     3. Manufacturers should allow approximately up to 2% of total 
          purchases to be returned  늞pened for free and charge for 
          any amount above that. Both hardware and software returns 
          should be complete (diskettes, power cords,  documentation, 
          etc.).

     4. To minimize the amounts (i.e., by using repackaging) and the 
          number of incomplete returns, manufacturers should provide 
          늘n box contents listings for all products, focusing on 
          primary accessories required for operation of the product 
          and the ability to purchase any missing items if necessary. 
          As the reseller/distributor is not equipped to perform a 
          detailed inspection of all products, such 늘n box 
          information should apply only to those components and 
          accessories readily visible within the box. Thi uld provide 
          the reseller/distributor with the ability to efficiently 
          scan the products for completeness upon receipt from the 
          customer and prior to return to the manufacturer. In cases 
          where excessive abuse is observed, this should be dealt with 
          quickly on an individual basis.

E. Discontinued product: It is recommended that manufacturers follow 
some or all of the guidelines listed below for minimizing problems 
related to this issue:

          1. Provide resellers/distributors 30 days notice on product 
               discontinuance.

          2. Provide options to return discontinued product within 60 days 
               from date of discontinuance.

          3. Provide market development funds (MDF), reduced prices, 
               rebates or other special incentives to move 
               discontinued product out of inventory.

          4. Provide a means to exchange or upgrade discontinued product at 
               no additional cost to the reseller/distributor.

All standard warranty and return policies should remain in effect on 
discontinued products.

F. Warranty Replacement: Many items, today, are being sold with 2 
year, 3 year, and often 녋ifetime warranties. The manufacturer needs 
to assume responsibility for handling warranty replacement of these 
items. Many manufacturers deal with multiple distributors, as do many 
resellers. In the industry today, with the proliferation of resellers, 
the customer often deals with a reseller who did not originally sell 
that product to them.

          1. Since there is a 녋ifetime or long-term replacement, 
               these should be handled directly by the manufacturer.

          [NOTE:  With the changes now occurring in the channel, a 
               document such as this requires that the uniqueness of 
               each channel segment be specifically addressed.  
               Because the policies of manufacturers, distributors and 
               resellers are becoming more segmented, a generalized 
               framework or baseline, such as these voluntary 
               Guidelines, must portray this reality. Therefore, the 
               next iteration of these Guidelines is already being 
               worked on and this further revised document will be 
               customized to reflect the realities in each channel 
               segment.]

<HR>
<H1><CENTER>Streamlining the Co-op Claims Process </H1>
<H2>The $20 Million Solution</H2></CENTER>
<PRE>
늆he computer industry as a whole has worked aggressively to reduce 
costs on everything we do  accomplishing this in a variety of ways, 
including inventing new technologies and investing in automation and 
infrastructure. Certainly, driving out operating inefficiencies has 
been one of the primary themes in our industry.  Yet nobody has put a 
lot of time and attention into the way we manage co-op administration 
and costs, declares Karen Fuller, chairman of the Co-op Task Force 
for the Lombard, IL-based Com puting Technology Industry Association 
(CompTIA).

In fact, Fuller wonders why has it taken so long to address the huge 
expenses involved in the area of co-op claims administration  
estimated at about $20 million annually.  It was a search for this 
$20 million solution that led Fuller and her Task Force to develop a 
new co-op/MDF reimbursement process and claim form that they hope the 
industry will adopt. Fuller, who is vice president of marketing at 
Merisel, and her Task Force have been working on taking an additional 
level of costs out of the industry뇹 business processes since January 
of 1994.  

According to Fuller, more than 30 leading industry companies are 
regular participants in the Co-op Task Force, with another two dozen 
or so that want to be kept up to date on all activities.  늆here is a 
very high level of interest from the reseller and manufacturer 
communities in Task Force activities.  It뇹 a pro blem near and dear 
to their hearts, Fuller states.

After surveying industry companies, the CompTIA Task Force found that 
manufacturers pay an average of $100 per co-op claim; while resellers 
and distributors pay about $176 per claim.  Cost factors on the vendor 
side included:  cost of 3rd party claim processors; manufacturer뇹 
personnel needed to administer the co-op claims process; claim form 
printing costs; and the time it takes sales reps to administer these 
programs.  

On the Distributor/Reseller side, cost factors included: co-op 
accounting personnel needed to administer claims; training time for 
personnel; duplicating and mailing costs (for copies of proof of 
performance and invoices); and write offs incurred because a vendor 
says something is missing on the form and refuses to pay the claim.

The group then spent several months trying to get their arms around the scope 
of the problem, Fuller said.  늉e wanted to redefine what an efficient co-op 
claims handling process would be  one that would still meet the needs of 
resellers, distributors and manufacturers, she stated. 

Among the problems that the CompTIA Task Force had to address were 
what Fuller terms the 녏olicing mechanisms  the mounds of paperwork 
and proofs of performance  that vendors built around the co-op claims 
process to ensure that their co-op/MDF dollars were spent on effective 
marketing activities and not wasted. Fuller points out that these 
mechanisms, which vendors felt were necessary because of past abuses 
of funds, created a bureaucratic nightmare for resellers and 
distributors.  In fact, Fuller notes, over the years the tightening 
of these procedures was often perceived by the reseller community as 
녏roof that manufacturers were trying to find ways to not spend the 
funds with them.

With an eye on streamlining current co-op reimbursement processes, the 
CompTIA Co-op Task Force has developed a process and form that it has 
dubbed Marketing Expenditure Agreement Letter (MEAL).  (See diagram 
below).  Called by some a 넰EAL ticket, the form outlines a common 
set of informational items that the Task Force believes is reasonable 
for manufacturers to expect when they agree to give co-op/MDF dollars.  
The MEAL becomes the prior approval agreement for manufacturers and 
the contractual document for distributors and resellers.

Utilizing the new system, Fuller explains, requires the use of only 
two invoices and the MEAL  thereby eliminating the pounds of 
paperwork that was required in the past, including proof of 
performance and backup documentation. With the new system, those items 
remain with the distributor and/or reseller unless specifically 
requested for examination by the manufacturer. 

In addition, the process that CompTIA is developing will also help 
ease the cash flow burden heretofore put on distributors and resellers 
by allowing for a proposed 50 percent prepayment of marketing/ 
promotional expenses in a timely manner. Fuller also stresses that the 
Task Force thoroughly reviewed the proposed Voluntary MEAL with the 
Association뇹 legal counsel to verify that it would not violate any 
provisions or rules of the FTC, Robinson-Patman Act or IRS 
regulations. 

As part of the goal to streamline the Co-op/MDF claims process, the 
Task Force has been working with Lotus Development to help automate 
the process.  Robert Caggiano, Distribution Channel Manager for Lotus 
Development, commends the efforts of CompTIA in attempting to solve 
this problem for the industry. He further states that Lotus has been 
working on this issue internally for the past year with its own MDF 
program.  Caggiano has offered on Lotus behalf a copy of Lotus Notes 
and the Lotus d eveloped MDF app lication in generic form to any 
reseller or manufacturer that adopts the proposed CompTIA process. 

Fuller goes on to say, 늉e believe that CompTIA has put together a 
viable and effective process that will enable the industry to cut out 
millions of dollars in wasted expenses.  Of course, the challenge now 
is to communicate the benefits of this process and get it adopted by 
manufacturers, distributors and resellers alike. 

Concludes John A. Venator, CompTIA뇹 Executive Director and CEO, 늆his 
effort will only be successful if there is widespread adoption of it. 
We anticipate that within the next few months  due to the efforts of 
good industry citizens such as Karen Fuller  all of the major 
distributors and master resellers will be adopting this process and 
asking manufacturers to do likewise. And, while such guidelines can 
only be voluntary on an industry-wide basis, we hope that the industry 
will move quickly to adopt them to help ensure the continued success 
of all players.

<body>
<p> The MMAE Department at the Illinois Institute of Technology 
offers the Bachelor of Science degrees in Mechanical 
Engineering (B.S.M.E.), Metallurgical and Materials Engineering 
(B.S.M.M.E.), and Aerospace Engineering (B.S.A.E.). These 
degree programs are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation 
Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and 
Technology (ABET). All three programs build upon a strong 
foundation in mathematics and basic sciences, the humanities 
and social sciences, and a balance of engineering topics in the 
respective disciplines; include innovative engineering 
activities and opportunities for undergraduate students; and 
are responsive to the changing needs of industry. The aim is to 
educate individuals for professional careers in engineering and 
to provide the basis for life-long learning and advanced study 
at the graduate level.</p>


<p>In recognition of the changing professional environment in 
which IIT뇹 graduates will function, the MMAE Department 
programs place substantial emphasis on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>teaching students to understand the economic, ethical, 
societal, environmental and international context of their professional activities,</li> 
<li>improving oral and written
communication skills,</li>
 <li>training students to work in 
multidisciplinary teams,</li>
<li>  preparing students for the 
interprofessional work force of the 21st century,</li>
<li> enhancing 
students abilities to link science and engineering principles 
to key technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students are introduced to the scope of 
the engineering profession in the first year courses 
Introduction to the Professions I and II, and to the ethical, 
economical, safety, environmental and other responsibilities of 
being a professional engineer. Strong emphasis is placed on 
development of oral and written communication skills. 
Accompanying courses in mathematics and the basic sciences 
provide the foundation for later studies of engineering 
sciences relevant to the students major fields of study. These 
areas include: energy and structures for the ME major; 
materials, processes and their selection, and plant design for 
the MME major; and structures and materials, propulsion and 
aerodynamics for the AE major.</p>
<p> The second year emphasizes 
building a foundation for the eventual study of engineering 
design. The engineering sciences offer a rational approach to 
solving detailed problems encountered in major-specific 
courses, including the capstone design courses, of the third 
and fourth years. The student뇹 professional experience is 
developed by participation in interprofessional projects in the 
second, third and fourth years.</p>
<p> In the third year, students 
begin the transition to professional practice and learn to 
develop sound engineering judgment by studying open ended 
problems and realistic constraints. Students build further on 
the engineering sciences and approximately one-third of 
major-specific course work is devoted to the introduction of 
tangible engineering design.</p> 
<p>The process continues into the 
fourth year where the metallurgical and materials program 
culminates in one and the mechanical and aerospace engineering 
programs culminate in two senior year capstone design courses. 
Mechanical engineering projects involve design of thermal and 
mechanical systems, metallurgical and materials engineering 
students develop new or optimized materials, processing routes 
and selection schemes, and aerospace engineering students 
produce conceptual designs of aircraft and spacecraft.</p>

<b><u></u>I.  INTRODUCTION  </b><p>
<b></b><p>
This guide serves as a supplement to the IIT Graduate Bulletin of Programs and
as a checklist for graduate students in regard to the Mechanical, Materials and
Aerospace Engineering (MMAE) Department's procedural requirements and
deadlines.  Deadlines are established by the Graduate School, and are also
listed in the current IIT Graduate Bulletin.  The Graduate Student Handbook,
which is usually distributed by mail or at the registration for each semester,
is another university publication that discusses the university's academic
policies for graduate students and  answers students' most frequently asked
questions.  It is the student's responsibility, with guidance from his/her
adviser, to follow the procedures, and meet the specified deadlines. These
deadlines are not flexible and failure to meet them will result in postponement
of the student's graduation.<p>
<p>
The MMAE faculty have the ultimate responsibility for the comprehensive
departmental program.  The Chairman of the Department, Professor Marek Dollar,
with consultation from the faculty, appoints at least six faculty members from
different specialized areas of study to serve on the Graduate Studies
Committee.  The Graduate Studies Committee approves all ordinary procedural
matters, which include the student's Program of Study and appointments of
committees to evaluate student examinations.  When extraordinary changes in
degree programs or in departmental policies appear desirable, the Graduate
Studies Committee will make recommendations to the faculty for discussion and
approval. Leadership of the committee is the responsibility of the appointed
Chairman, Professor David Williams, and Co-Chairman, Professor Philip Nash.
The chairman, with assistance from the co-chairman handles the day-to-day
obligations of the graduate studies program, including graduate admissions and
new student advising.  Appointments to the Graduate Studies Committee are made
for a one year period, and are renewable on a year to year basis.  The
committee will usually meet once a month for the duration of the academic
year.<p>
<p>
The MMAE department offers graduate programs in <b>Mechanical and Aerospace
Engineering (MAE)</b>  leading to: <p><UL>
&#183;	Master of  Science in mechanical and aerospace engineering (MSMAE),<br>
&#183;	Master of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MEMAE) and<br>
&#183;	Doctor of Philosophy in mechanical and aerospace engineering.   </UL>
The department also offers graduate studies in <b>Metallurgical and Materials
Engineering (METM) </b>leading to:<p><UL>
&#183;	Master of Science in metallurgical and materials engineering (MSMETM)
<br>
&#183;	Master of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering (MEMETM) and <br>
&#183;	Doctor of Philosophy in metallurgical and materials engineering. </UL>
In addition, the department offers interdisciplinary programs leading to :<p><UL>
&#183;	Master of Science in manufacturing engineering  (MSMFG) and<br>
&#183;	Master of Manufacturing Engineering (MEMFG).</UL>
<b></b><p>
<a name="1.0"></a>
<b>1.  GENERAL OPERATING PROCEDURES</b><p>
<a name="1.1"></a>
<b>1.1  Registration Procedures</b><p>
<b></b>The Schedule of Classes for each semester is available at the end of the
previous semester and is mailed to continuing students.  This Schedule also
serves as an excellent guide to registration procedures.  <p>
<p>
Graduate students normally register for classes during arena registration (held
the week preceding the beginning of each semester).  New graduate students can
pick up their registration forms in the MMAE office, Room 243-E1, usually on
the Monday of registration week.  Continuing full-time students should receive
their forms by mail and may register in advance in April (for fall semester) or
November (for spring semester).  Those students who do not receive their
registration forms in the mail should contact the Registrar Office.  Students
who have not submitted a Program of Study prior to completing twelve credit
hours, or those who owe tuition or fees, will have their registration forms
withheld until such matters have been settled.  Students are urged to inform
the Registrar's Office of any change of address.<p>
<p>
Registration forms, once signed by the student and his/her adviser, are to be
submitted to the MMAE Office for the department chairman's approval.  The
student then takes the approved form to arena registration. Any changes made
after the approval will require the additional signature of the student's
adviser and the department chair. Students who cannot attend arena registration
should either pre-register or make arrangements for someone to register for
them.<p>
<p>
Graduate students receiving financial assistance are required to submit
approved registration forms (signed by the student and his/her adviser) to the
MMAE office no later than July 20th (for fall semester) or January 5th (for
spring semester).  Tuition vouchers will be prepared and attached to the
registration forms for approval by the department chair, the college dean, and
the dean of the Graduate College.  The department secretary will obtain these
signatures, provided that students submit their approved registration form
before the above listed deadline.  Approved registration forms and tuition
vouchers can then be picked up just prior to the start of the full-time
graduate students' arena registration session.  All students receiving
financial assistance from the MMAE department must be working towards a Master
of Science or a Doctor of Philosophy degree. <p>
<b></b><p>
<a name="1.2"></a>
<b>1.2 Special Graduate Student Status</b><b></b><p>
<b></b>A student who has not obtained admission to the Graduate School may seek
to register as a special graduate student.  Special graduate students must
complete a Special Student Application and submit an official transcript of all
previous undergraduate and graduate work to the Graduate Records Office. The
minimum requirements for permission to register, set by the Graduate School,
are a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution and a GPA of 2.5/4.0 or
equivalent.  Foreign students with F-1 visas issued by IIT may not be enrolled
as special graduate students.  Special graduate students may enroll for a
maximum of nine credit hours per semester.  All special graduate student
applicants planning to take MAE courses must obtain the approval of the Chair
of the MMAE Department Graduate Studies Committee.<p>
<p>
An applicant who is denied admission to the MMAE department's graduate program
may be allowed to enroll as a Special Graduate Student, if the department
believes that the applicant merits a chance to demonstrate his/her ability to
succeed in the program.  The department reserves the right to review and
approve or deny the application of any person who wishes to enroll in a
department course.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>A special graduate student must complete a minimum of six credit hours
of graduate coursework (maintaining a GPA of 3.0 or better) before the MMAE
department will reconsider his/her application for admission as a regular
graduate student.  Note that maintaining the minimum GPA requirement does not
guarantee admission to the MMAE department's graduate program.  Applications
for change of status from Special to Regular Graduate Student must be
accompanied by<b><i> Form #401, Program of Study </i></b>(sample available on
page 17), signed by a faculty member who is willing to serve as the student's
adviser.  The Graduate Studies Committee will then review the program of study
as part of the student's application for regular admission. No more than nine
credit hours of coursework taken as a special graduate student may be applied
towards the student's program of study.<p>
<b></b><p>
<a name="1.3"></a>
<b>1.3 Leave of Absence</b><p>
Students admitted to regular status are expected to maintain continued
registration (excluding summer semester) until graduation unless they are
granted a leave of absence from the Dean of the Graduate School.  For this
purpose, use<b><i> Form 216, Request for Leave of Absence, </i></b>(sample
available on  page 19). A student who withdraws without permission, or who lets
a granted leave of absence expire, must  apply to the department  for
readmission.  If less than three years has lapsed since the student registered,
readmission normally requires a letter of endorsement from the student's
adviser to the Dean of the Graduate School.  For absences of three years or
more, a new application and supporting documents (transcripts, letters of
recommendation) are required.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<a name="1.4"></a>
<b>1.4 Department Financial Assistance Policy</b><p>
The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering has a limited number of
teaching assistantships available to graduate students in the department who
show a high potential for success in the programs and have necessary teaching
skills.  Applications (sample available on page 20) can be obtained from the
Department Secretary.  The Department Chairman awards these assistantships to
the most qualified students for a certain period of time during their degree
programs.  This period of support is determined by the Chairman for each
individual case.  In order to make these awards to as many deserving students
as possible, teaching assistantships are awarded for the maximum number of
semesters as follows:<p><UL>
&#183;	Master of Science Students: 3 semesters<br>
&#183;	Doctor of Philosophy students: 4 semesters<br>
&#183;	Ph.D.  students with a master's degree from IIT: 5 semesters</UL>
<p>
Only Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degree students are eligible
for teaching assistantships.  The availability of these assistantships is
dependent upon the needs of the department.  After this assistantship has been
used, a teaching assistant who is performing well may then  be supported by
his/her adviser as a research assistant.   The student is encouraged to pursue
a research assistantship as early in the program as possible.<p>
<p>
IIT's Financial Aid Office offers a limited program of financial assistance, in
the form of work opportunities and loans, to graduate students.  Consult the
IIT Bulletin or contact the Student Finance Center at 312/567-3303 for further
information.<p>
<p>
<a name="1.5"></a>
<b>1.5  Advising Procedures</b><p>
<b></b>The Chair of the Graduate Studies Committee serves as the temporary
adviser to all new mechanical and aerospace engineering graduate students.  The
Co-Chair of the Graduate Studies Committee serves as a temporary adviser to all
new metallurgical and materials engineering graduate students.  In many cases
the chairman and co-chairman serve as permanent advisers to part-time students.
All students are required to find a permanent adviser and submit a Program of
Study to the MMAE office before the beginning of the second semester for
full-time students<a href="guide_fn.html#p3fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>, or before enrollment
beyond 12 credit hours for part-time students.  All graduate students are
advised to leave changes to their mailing addresses and/or telephone numbers
with the MMAE department secretary.<p>
<p>
Students should consult with their advisers as early as possible, in order to
choose their courses.  Students registering for any of the following courses
should use their adviser's identification number as the section number when
registering:<p><UL>
&#183;	MAE 591 OR METM 591 -  Research and Thesis for M.S.<a
href="guide_fn.html#p3fn2"><sup>2</sup></a><b> </b>Degree<br>

<b><center>1. PROGRAM OF STUDY</b><p>
<b></center></b>The student selects courses, with guidance from his/her
adviser, and submits a Program of Study signed by  his/her adviser to the MMAE
office before the beginning of the second semester or before completing 12
credit hours. <b><i>Form #401, Program of Study, </i> </b>(sample available on
page 17), is employed for this purpose.  The Program of Study form once
approved by the adviser also requires the approval of the Graduate Studies
Committee and the signatures of the Chairman of the Department, and the dean of
the Graduate School. Once a student has filed an approved program of study,
deviation from the plan requires the same signatures on <b><i>Form #406, Change
in previously approved Program of Study,</i></b> (sample available on page 21)
as the original plan of  study.  After the student has chosen a permanent
adviser, to change advisers, it is necessary to complete F<b>orm #410,
</b>Change of Adviser (sample available on page 22).<p>
<p>
All full-time MMAE students must register each semester for either MAE 593
(Department Seminar Series for mechanical and aerospace engineering students)
or METM 593 (Department Seminar Series for metallurgical and materials
students.  Both seminars are no fee, no credit classes, but registration and
attendance for one hour a week is mandatory.  The seminar is a pass or fail
class and will be graded on attendance.  A student will receive a passing grade
if he/she attends a minimum of 80% of the seminars offered in that semester.

<b>2. COMPLETION OF STUDIES &amp; GRADUATION</b><p>
<b></b>Once a student successfully completes the coursework and thesis research
(if applicable) as outlined in his/her Program of Study,  the student files
an<b> <i>Application for Graduation,</i> <i>Form #527</i></b> (sample available
on page 23) with the Graduate Records Office, within two weeks of the start of
the intended graduation semester. The application is valid only in the semester
in which it is filed.  If the student fails to graduate in the intended
semester, then a new application must be filed for a later semester.<p>
<p>
After the application is filed, the Graduate College will mail to the
graduating student <i>The Sequence of Events and Deadlines</i>, applicable to
that semester. The student's adviser, using <b><i>MMAE Form #101</i>, <i>A
Request for Appointment of Committee</i></b> (sample available on page 24)<i>
</i> recommends, and the Graduate Studies Committee approves, the appointment
of  a Thesis Review and Examination Committee (T.R.E.C.) for M.S. students,  or
an Examination Committee for M.E. students.  The committee consists of at least
three faculty members<a href="guide_fn.html#p8fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> whose purpose is to
evaluate the student's thesis (M.S.) or  non-thesis project assignment (M.E.),
and the  comprehensive examination. It is the student's responsibility to
ensure that the request for appointment is made.<p>
<p>
<A NAME="M2.1"></A>
<b>2.1  Master of Science Candidates </b><p>
<b>       Thesis and Comprehensive Examination Procedures</b><p>
<b></b>A mandatory  thesis preparation discussion is held early each semester
by the Graduate College to assist students in preparing their thesis and
alerting them to problems that may occur. The MMAE student's thesis must
conform to the guidelines given in the latest IIT Thesis Manual (complimentary
copies of the Thesis Manual will be distributed at the meeting). The Thesis
Manual can be purchased in the IIT Bookstore.<p>
<p>
The student prepares a preliminary draft of his/her thesis, at least five weeks
before graduation, and obtains the signature approval from his/her adviser,
each T.R.E.C. member, the department chair<a href="guide_fn.html#p8fn8"><sup>8</sup></a>
and the Graduate School Thesis Examiner using <b><i>Form #501A, Preliminary
Thesis Approval Form</i> </b>(sample available on page 25).  The Thesis
Examiner is available to the students for guidance in order to meet the
requirements set out in the Thesis Manual.   The student's initial appointment
with the Thesis Examiner must be made at least six weeks before the end of the
anticipated graduation semester.  The Thesis Examiner's schedule, phone number
and office location is posted in the Graduate College.  Meetings are by
appointment only.  <p>
<p>
At least seven days prior to the comprehensive examination, the student
distributes copies of the approved thesis draft to the T.R.E.C. members.
His/her adviser then sends a memo to all MMAE faculty members announcing the
place and time of the examination.  This memo should include an abstract of the
thesis.  It is the student's responsibility to ensure that this memo is sent on
time.  Failure to do so will result in the rescheduling of the examination.<p>
<p>
T.R.E.C. conducts a comprehensive oral examination on the student's thesis and
related areas. <a href="guide_fn.html#p8fn9"><sup>9</sup></a> This examination is
scheduled at a mutually convenient time and date, but must be taken at least
fifteen days prior to the end of the semester.  The adviser reports the results
of the examination to the department using <b><i>MMAE Form #103, Results of
Master's Comprehensive Examination </i></b>(sample available on page 26)
<b><i>and  Form #303, Master's Comprehensive/ Ph.D. Qualifying
Exam</i></b>(sample available on page 27).  <p>
<p>
The student obtains signature approvals of the final thesis draft from his/her
adviser, T.R.E.C. members, and the department chair on <b><i>Form #501B, Final
Thesis Approval,  </i></b>(sample available on page 25). The student pays the
advanced degree fee at the Bursar's office. At least 9 days before
commencement, the student meets with the Thesis Examiner for final thesis
approval with three unbound copies of the completed thesis in marked manila
envelopes with original signature of adviser on title pages, a Bursar's receipt

signatures except the final Thesis Examiner's.<p>
<p>
Note:  Three copies of the thesis are required and after binding the library,
department archives, and adviser each receives a copy.  The Graduate School
will not provide binding  for more than three copies, but the student is urged
to get his/her own private copy bound at the IIT Office Services or

<b>       Non-Thesis Project and Comprehensive Examination</b><p>
The adviser assigns the student a non-thesis project at least three weeks prior
to the comprehensive exam, and informs the examination committee of the
assignment. This assignment, while concentrating on the major area, may draw
upon the student's ability to apply the concepts of any or all of his/her
course-work. Students who have taken MAE or METM 594 or a 5x9 course (with the
exception of 509 &amp; 529) and wish to use their topics as the assignment may
do so with the approval of their advisor.<p>
<p>
At least seven days prior to the comprehensive exam, the student submits a
written report on the assignment (approved by his/her adviser) to each
Comprehensive Examination Committee members. The adviser sends a memo to all
MMAE faculty members, announcing the time and place of the exam.  This memo may
include a short abstract of the student's report. <p>
<p>
The comprehensive exam is an oral examination on the student's assignment
and/or related areas.<a href="guide_fn.html#p9fn10"><sup>10 </sup></a>  The student must also have available at
the time of the oral examination, a written draft of the assignment.  The
deadline for the comprehensive examination is one week prior to the last date
to report the comprehensive examination results.  The result of the oral
examination is reported by the adviser to the department on <b><i>MMAE Form
#103, Result of the Master's Comprehensive Examination </i></b>(example
available on page 26). <b> </b>The student then makes any minor corrections or
changes in the report that the comprehensive examination committee finds
necessary.  If major corrections or revisions are necessary, the student is
considered to have failed the examination.<a href="guide_fn.html#p9fn11"><sup>11</sup></a>
The student obtains the adviser's final approval of the assignment by signing
the <b><i>Form #303, Master's Comprehensive/Ph.D. Qualifying Examination
</i></b>(example available on page 27).  The student brings one copy of the
final report (for the departmental archives) and the signed <b><i>Form
#303</i></b> to the department chair.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>As a result of the completion of courses and the above mentioned
efforts, the student graduates and is awarded an  M.E. Degree.<p>
<p>
Note: The Master of Engineering Programs in Mechanical and Aerospace
Engineering; and Metallurgical and Materials Engineering are being
significantly revised.  The new programs will be in effect for August 1996.
Changes were made to the programs in order to better accommodate the working

<b>III. Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)</b><b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<i></i><p>
<i><center>The doctorate is awarded upon achievement of a high degree of
mastery in a field of knowledge and upon demonstration of a distinct ability to
make substantial creative contributions to that field.  The Ph.D. is not
awarded merely as a result of specific courses taken or of years spent in study
or research; the quality of work and the resourcefulness of the student must be
such that the faculty is convinced that the student will be capable of a
continuing effort toward the advancement of knowledge and continuing
achievement in research and other scholarly activities.	</i><p>
<i></center>IIT Graduate Bulletin of Programs  1994 -1996</i><p>

<A NAME="P1.0"></A>
<i></i><b>1. PROGRAM OF STUDY</b><p>
<b></b>The Ph.D. candidate will have met the requirements for a master's degree
or presented evidence that he/she has reached the equivalent level of
proficiency.  Students who have earned a Master's degree from IIT and wish to
pursue a doctorate must reapply to the Graduate School through the Graduate
Admissions Office. Work for the Ph.D. generally takes a minimum of three years
beyond the bachelor's degree (or six semesters of registration for at least 16
credit hours of graduate work each semester for a total of at least 96 credit
hours).  Some of the work done towards a master's degree in the same field may
apply toward satisfying the requirements for the Ph.D.<p>
<p>
Students who wish to transfer a Master's degree from another U.S. institution
should be prepared to provide course descriptions and/or syllabi to the
Graduate Studies Committee.  Students who wish to transfer a master's degree
from an international university must petition the MMAE Graduate Studies
Committee and should be prepared to provide appropriate documentation.
Documentation includes, but is not limited to, transcripts, catalogues with
course descriptions, course syllabi, and letters of endorsement from
individuals in the field who are familiar with the university and its programs.
The Graduate Studies Committee will evaluate the student's transcripts and
supporting documentation to determine how many transfer credits should be
awarded, according to IIT standards.<p>
<p>
The student selects a permanent adviser, (MAE students must also choose a major
and a minor from the four area of study)  and submits a program of study on<i>
<b> Form #401, Program of Study </b></i>(sample available on page 17) to the
MMAE office. (For a guide to developing an MAE Ph.D. Program of Study, see page
11; for a METM Ph.D. Program of Study, see page 12). Doctoral candidates who
have earned a master's degree must file a program of study before beginning the
second semester or before completing 12 credit hours. Doctoral candidates
without a master's degree must file an approved program of study within 16
months after initial enrollment or before completing 36 credit hours in the
Ph.D. program.<p>
<p>
The student's permanent adviser will help the student formulate an overall plan
of study, including coursework, reading, independent study and possibly a plan
of research.  A significant portion of the Program of Study is devoted to
independent research leading to a dissertation.  Each student must include the
equivalent of at least two semesters of full-time study devoted to research.
Semesters need not be consecutive.<p>
<p>
The Program of Study requires approval of the student's adviser, the Graduate
Studies Committee, the Department Chair, and the dean of the Graduate School.
Once a program of study is approved, any proposed changes must be submitted to
the Graduate Studies Committee on <b><i> Form #406, Change in Previously
Approved Program of Study,</i></b> (sample available on page
21).<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><p>
<b></b>All full-time MMAE students must register each semester for either MAE
593 (Department Seminar Series for mechanical and aerospace engineering
students) or METM 593 (Department Seminar Series for metallurgical and
materials students.  Both seminars are no fee, no credit classes, but
registration and attendance for one hour a week is mandatory.  The seminar is a
pass or fail class and will be graded on attendance.  A student will receive a
passing grade if he/she attends a minimum of 80% of the seminars offered in
that semester.  <p>

&#183;	the third semester - for students with M.S. degrees from other U.S.
institutions<br>
&#183;	the fourth semester - all other students.</UL>
<p>
The Ph.D. qualifying examination is a written examination given each February,
and is administered by an examination committee appointed by the Graduate
Studies Committee in cooperation with the faculty. If sufficient interest
exists, the qualifying exam may also be given in October.  No student may
register for MAE 691 or METM 691, Ph.D. Research and Thesis until he/she has
passed the qualifying examination.<p>
<p>
<A NAME="P2.1"></A>
<b>2.1  MAE Qualifying Exam</b> <p>
The Ph.D. qualifying examination for MAE students consists of 13 problems: <p><UL>
&#183;	two from Engineering Analysis (MAE 508, MAE 509)<br>
&#183;	one from Computational Methods (MAE 507)<br>
&#183;	two from Fluid Mechanics (MAE 510)<br>
&#183;	two from Thermal Sciences (MAE 520, MAE 582)<br>

&#183;	two from Dynamics and Vibrations (MAE 570, MAE 574)</UL>
<p>
Students must answer four of the problems as follows: one from engineering
analysis (not including computational methods), one from their major area, one
from their minor area, and one from any of the above areas.  Students are given
five hours to complete the four problems.  Based on the student's performance
on the written exam, the committee may decide to continue the exam in oral form
towards the end of the semester.  <p>

<b>3.3 Ph.D. Thesis Review &amp; Defense Examination Committee</b><p>
As the student nears completion of his/her dissertation, a Ph.D. Thesis Review
and Defense Examination Committee is appointed.  <p>
<p>
The members of the MAE student's  committee are:<p><UL>
&#183;	Comprehensive Examination Committee (without the engineering analysis
representative)</UL>
The members of the METM student's committee are:<p><UL>
&#183;	Comprehensive Examination Committee</UL>
<p>
A request for the appointment of this committee should be made by the adviser
to the Graduate Studies Committee on<b><i> MAE Form #101, Request for
Appointment of Committee,</i></b> (sample available on  page 24) in
anticipation of approval of the preliminary draft of the dissertation.  The
committee is then appointed by the dean of the Graduate College upon the
recommendation of the Graduate Studies Committee on <b><i>Form
#301</i></b><i>.</i>  Form 301 must be submitted to the dean of the Graduate
College at least two weeks prior to the exam and five weeks prior to
commencement.  <p>
<p>
A voluntary thesis preparation discussion is held early each semester to assist
students in preparing their thesis and alerting them to problems that may
occur.  The exact date and time are announced each semester by the  Graduate
College.  The MMAE student's thesis must conform to the guidelines given in the
latest IIT Thesis Manual (complimentary copies of the Thesis Manual will be
distributed at the meeting). The Thesis Manual can be purchased in the IIT
Bookstore. The Thesis Examiner is the appointed expert available to the
students for guidance in conforming to the requirements set out in the Thesis
Manual.   The student's initial appointment with the Thesis Examiner must be
made at least six weeks before the end of the anticipated graduation semester.
The Thesis Examiner's schedule, phone number and office location is posted in
the Graduate College.  <p>
<p>
Upon completion of the dissertation research, the student prepares a
preliminary draft of his/her dissertation and submits copies to the committee.
The student obtains approval of the preliminary draft of the dissertation from
the committee members, the Department Chair, and the Thesis Examiner (by prior
appointment) on <b><i>Form #501A, Preliminary Thesis Approval, </i></b>(sample
available on  page 25) at least 5 weeks before commencement.<p>
<p>
After the preliminary draft of the dissertation is approved, the student
defends his/her dissertation at a final oral public examination<a
href="guide_fn.html#p15fn8"><sup>8</sup></a>. The results of the Defense Examination should
be reported to the Graduate College on <b><i>Form # 309</i></b> (sample
available on page 28), by the student's advisor in the presence of all members
of the Comprehensive Examination Committee, and should be returned to the dean
of the Graduate College within 48 hours.<p>
<p>
Once the final draft is approved by the committee on<i> <b>Form #501B, Final
Thesis Approval,</b></i><b> </b>(sample available on page 25)<b> </b>the
student can obtain his/her  advisor's signature on the final draft of the
dissertation.  The student  can then pay the advanced degree fee in the
Bursar's office.<p>
<p>
The student meets with the Thesis Examiner at least 9 days before commencement
for final dissertation approval (by prior appointment) with the following:  <p><UL>
&#183;	Three copies of dissertation in separately labeled manila envelopes.<br>
&#183;	Bursar's receipt showing payment of fee.<br>
&#183;	Form #50lB bearing all approval signatures except the final Thesis
Examiner's.<br>
&#183;	Two copies of dissertation abstract of less than 60 words in
dissertation abstract style.<br>
&#183;	One copy of University Microfilms Agreement Form.<br>
&#183;	Two copies of the Survey of Earned Doctorates Form.<br>
&#183;	One separate title page.</UL>
<p>
Note:  Three copies of the dissertation are required and after binding, the
library, departmental reading room, and adviser each receives a copy.  The
student is urged to get his/her own private copy bound at the IIT Office
Services or elsewhere.  <p>
<p>
The student graduates with Ph.D. degree.<p>
<p>
Either prior or subsequent to graduation, the student is expected to prepare a
paper on his/her research in a form suitable for publication.<p>

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong>Mechatronics Design - Concept and Tools</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong> Mechatronics has developed worldwide into a very attractive research area. It combines in a synergetic way the classical engineering disciplines of mechanical and electrical engineering and computer science, leading to new kinds of products.  Mechatronics is a relatively new area of science and technology.  We are working intensively in this field.  The lecture includes explanation what we understand by the mechatronics, what kind of tools are used for mechatronic design.  Two mechatronic project results will be reported. </p>
<p> The other topic which is intensively studied in our department is education in mechatronics.  Some goals and requirements for education in mechatronics will be shown and discussed.</p>

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong>Instantaneous Velocity and Pressure Features in a Turbulent Boundary Layer</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>The velocity in a turbulent boundary layer was measured with Particle Image Velocimetry simultaneously with the 
wall pressure using a 13 x 3 array of microphones at Re<sub><font size=2>theta</font></sub><font size=3> = 1520, 3950 and 6790. Velocity measurements spanned two 
boundary layer thickness, 2</font><font size=4><em> </em></font><font size=3><em>delta</em></font><font size=4>, </font><font size=3>in the streamwise direction and from the buffer layer to nearly <em>delta</em>, in the wall normal 
direction. The wall pressure spanned 1 <em>delta</em> in the streamwise direction. The instantaneous velocity fields show organized 
motions also observed in data bases of Direct Numerical Simulations performed at lower Reynolds numbers. The shear 
layer structure is present in many of the realizations and the slope of the interface that divides low and high streamwise 
momentum flow ranges from 20&#186; when the shear layer is confined to the near wall region (<em>y</em></font><sup><font size=2><em>+</em></font></sup><font size=3> &lt; 100) to 45&#186; when spanning 
several hundred <em>y</em></font><sup><font size=2><em>+</em></font></sup><font size=3>. The shear layer interface is characterized by multiple vortex-like structures. Negative total vorticity, 
typically on the order of <em>omega</em></font><sub><font size=2><em>z</em></font></sub><font size=3> </font><sup><font size=2>+</font></sup><font size=3>&lt; -0.07, is distributed along the interface; however, only localized areas exist where there 
is significant levels of negative Reynolds Stress product, <em>u'v' </em>&lt; -3 <em>utau</em></font><sup><font size=2>2 </font></sup><font size=2>. </font><font size=3>The characteristic wall pressure signature of a 
shear layer consists of consecutive negative and positive pressures composing a local adverse <em>dp/dx</em>. It is estimated that the 
structures associated with this wall-pressure signature convects at a speed of 0.5 <em>U</em></font><sub><font size=2><em>inf</em></font></sub><font size=3> (12<em> utau</em>) with the positive pressure 
peak preceding the negative pressure peak by some eight viscous time units (<em>t</em></font><sup><font size=2><em>+</em></font></sup><font size=3> = 8). Tracking some of these structures 
shows that they may convect large distances, on the order of <em>delta</em>.</font></p>

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong>So You Think You Have a Corrosion Problem</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>Corrosion continues to cost over 4% of the Gross National Product of most industrialized countries. In the U.S. 
alone, the cost is more than $200 billion annually. Judicious application of existing corrosion control technology would trim 
roughly 15% from that total; worldwide activity to develop additional corrosion control technologies continues at a rapid 
pace.</p>
<p>Understanding the many variables that contribute to a corrosion process is necessary to develop an effective corrosion 
control strategy. The purpose of this seminar is to present a series of vignettes that describe basic corrosion principles and 
apply them to the solution of everyday corrosion problems. The areas to be covered are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Uniform Corrosion (galvanneal steel wall stud example, et al)</li>
<li>Localized Corrosion (underdeposit corrosion example, et al)</li>
<li>Galvanic Corrosion (edge rust in galvanized steel example, et al)</li>
<li>Intergranular Corrosion (sensitized stainless steel example, et al)</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong> Metal Injection Molding is a powder processing technology that has developed commercially within the last 15-20 years.

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong>"The Work of Engineering Schools: An Organization Shift for 21st Century Education and Research"</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>
Engineering education is in the midst of a transforming shift that began 
at the beginning of the last quarter of the present century.  While the 
curriculum retains the structure and pedagogy of the mid-20th Century, 
concern for its long-term viability and utility has risen in the face of 
an altered over arching external framework.  The seminar will discuss the 
following key elements for the future of engineering education:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Major trends in technology and engineering since the 19th Century</li>
<li>The paradox of the 1990s in engineering education</li>
<li>Key questions for the curriculum and the organization to support it</li>
<li>What needs to be done in the schools and for the faculty</li>

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong> Fuel Cells for Utility and Electric Vehicle Applications: Are They Technically Viable? Will They Be Commercially Viable?</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong> During recent decades there has been a sustained effort, worldwide, to develop fuel cells, operating on natural gas or coal gas, for decentralized power generation and cogeneration.  This effort, based largely on U.S. technology but vigorously pursued by Japan and many European countries as well, is driven by economic as well as environmental factors.  Almost 100 phosphoric acid fuel cell plants, which work at 390 F, are in operation all over the world, and three pivotal demonstrations of 100-KW to 2-MW units of advanced types of high-temperature fuel cells are scheduled, two of which are taking place in California this year.  These advanced high-temperature fuel cells are the molten carbonate fuel cell, operating at 1200 F, and the solid-oxide fuel cell, at 1800 F, both capable of 55-60% chemical-to-electrical efficiency.  Building on the technical successes in theis emerging technology, car manufacturers are now showing strong interest in low-temperature fuel cells such as the polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cell, which operates on hydrogen or on reformed methanol at temperatures from 180 F up. </p>
<p> In the development of fuel cells beyond the lab stage, electrochemistry, chemical engineering and materials engineering play a major role.  New materials are needed for electrolyte and electodes.  The design and operation of effective electodes requires analysis of the interaction between chemical kinetics, mass transfer, heat transfer, and properties <em> in situ </em> (for example by AC impedance measurements) is a challenge. </p>
<p> Beyond the technical challenge, today's first need is to define and expand the market for fuel cells, and to find the capital to finance "traveling down the learning curve".  Some key aspects in the effort to bring fuel cells to commercial reality, especially their potential role in electric vehicles, will be discussed. </p>

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong>Exact Solutions in Compressible Finite Elasticity</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>The constraint of incompressibility has led to the discovery of several exact solutions in isotropic finite elasticity, 
most notably the controllable or universal solutions of Rivlin and others. Ericksen has examined the problem of finding all 
such solutions. He has also proved that there are no controllable finite deformations in isotropic compressible elasticity, 
except for homogeneous deformations.</p>
<p>In this talk some related questions are examined for three special classes of compressible isotropic elastic materials, one of 
which is the class of harmonic materials. Several closed form solutions, similar to the Rivlin solutions, are obtained. In 
particular, some classes of controllable deformations are addressed, with rather surprising results. For instance, it is shown 
that every harmonic scalar function generates a deformation that is controllable for harmonic materials. Finally, analysis of 
the controllability conditions suggests that the three classes of strain energy functions considered may be the only ones for 
which results of this type can be obtained.</p>

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong> Hypereutectic Al-Si Alloy Casting Technology and Its Potential</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>
The typical hypereutectic Al-Si alloy freezes over a relatively 
wide temperature range and is characterized by (1) a high thermal 
diffusivity and (2) a high heat of fusion, both of which tend to minimize 
temperature gradients, expand the range where liquid and solid coexists 
in the mushy state, and upon solidifications lead to unfed shrinkage 
sites (i.e. microporosity) to be dispersed throughout the casting. 
Four-cycle engine blocks made with these alloys typically exhibit high 
oil consumption because of the microporosity.
</p>
<p>
	This presentation examines Mercury Marines patented Mercosil 
Engine Block Technology that solves the problems of the past associated 
with the wide solidification range. The patented Mercosil composition is 
a wear resistant, easily cast, hypereutectic Al-Si alloy of narrow 
solidification range that solidifies with an improved primary silicon 
distribution and an absence of microporosity. A higher silicon content 
version of Mercosil is also patented. This alloy composition has twice 
the wear resistance of Mercosil, and allows automotive the option of not 
having to etch the bores. Because this alloy has a  solidus melting point 
100F higher than conventional hypereutectic Al-Si alloys, the alloy has 
significant potential as a cast-in aluminum alloy liner. Mercury, in 
addition, has patented a high magnesium content version of Mercosil that 
is specifically designed for the lost Foam Casting Process. The alloy 
eliminates the liquid styrene defect and has great potential for 
defect-free automotive Lost Foam engine blocks. The alloy has particular 
value to Mercury Marine in its outboard business because Mercury has also 
patented the two-cycle engine block made by the Lost Foam Casting Process.

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong>Novel Chemically Bonded Phosphate Ceramics For Stabilizing Low-Level Mixed Wastes.</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>
Novel chemically bonded phosphate ceramics have been developed by 
acid-base reactions between magnesium oxide and an acid phosphate for 
stabilizing U.S. Department of Energy's low-level mixed waste streams.  
The acid-base reaction slurry formed a monolithic crystalline ceramic at 
room temperature.  Using these chemically bonded phosphate matrices, 
low-level mixed waste streams were stabilized that formed superior waste 
forms in a monolithic structure.  The final waste forms showed low open 
porosity and permeability, and one order of magnitude higher compression 
strength than the LDR.  Using this stabilization technology, operational 
size (55 gal.) monolithics were formed without losing physical 
integrity.  The hazardous contaminants in waste streams, such as RCRA 
heavy metals (Hg,Pb,Cd,Cr,Ni,etc) as well as radioactive elements (Ce as 
a surrogate of U and Pu), are chemically fixed by phosphate and 
physically encapsulated by phosphate ceramics.  These results on uranium 
were confirmed using uranium contaminated waste and waste water.

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong> The Deformation of Martensite</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>
	Several unexpected effects are observed when as-quenched 
martensites in carbon and alloy steels are deformed. Die drawing these 
steels results in dramatic strength increases, introduction of a yield 
point phenomena, decrease in electrical resistivity, sharpening of 
(110)x-ray diffraction lines and others. Tempering effects are also 
unusual. The findings are consistent with a soft martensite concept in 
which rapidly occurring carbon-vacancy interaction accompanies deformation.

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong> A Stabilized Space-Time Formulation of the Navier-Stokes Equations for Moving Domain Problems </p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>
A space-time finite element formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations
is presented for the analysis of flows over moving and deforming domains.
The variational equation is based on time discontinuous Galerkin method 
and employs the physical entropy variables. A least-squares operator is 
added to the formulation to improve the stability of the method and 
to account for unresolved internal and boundary layers. In this 
formulation the elements can be oriented in time to accommodate the 
spatial deformations.  If they are oriented along the particle paths,
the method is Lagrangian and if they are held fixed in time, it is Eulerian.
Consequently this formulation is analogous to the arbitrary 
Lagrangian-Eulerian techniques. 
Exploiting the idea of arbitrary orientation in time of the space-time
elements, a novel mesh rezoning technique is proposed.
This technique  adapts the fluid mesh to the moving domain with 
deforming boundaries. The approach is quite general and can be applied
to structured and unstructured meshes.
Numerical results are presented to show the performance of the method.

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong>An Introduction to Metal Injection Molding "Plastic Metals"</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong> Metal Injection Molding is a powder processing technology that has developed commercially within the last 15-20 years.  The advantages of the technology, is that complex parts that were once machined or cast, can now be processed to near net shape.  The cost reductions thus obtained can approach 30-50%. </p>
<p> The process consists of mixing fine metal powders with a polymer/wax binder carrier and subsequently molding the material into a specially designed die or tool.  The crux of the process is to remove the binder, whose only purpose is to allow the powders to be injected into the die, and sinter at temperatures ranging from 2200 F - 2400 F to levels approaching 95% of full wrought densities.  At present carbon steels, stainless steels, tool steels and non-ferrous alloys such as copper have been developed for gun parts, medical devices, automotive applications and computer peripherals such as heat sinks.</p>
<p> Details of the process will be discussed in the context of the other forming processes such as machining, casting and forming; and a contrast will be drawn when comparing MIM to the classical powder metallurgy processes.  Examples of parts produced by MIM will be shown. </p>

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong>Mechatronics Design - Concept and Tools</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong> Mechatronics has developed worldwide into a very attractive research area. It combines in a synergetic way the classical engineering disciplines of mechanical and electrical engineering and computer science, leading to new kinds of products.  Mechatronics is a relatively new area of science and technology.  We are working intensively in this field.  The lecture includes explanation what we understand by the mechatronics, what kind of tools are used for mechatronic design.  Two mechatronic project results will be reported. </p>
<p> The other topic which is intensively studied in our department is education in mechatronics.  Some goals and requirements for education in mechatronics will be shown and discussed.</p>

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong>Instantaneous Velocity and Pressure Features in a Turbulent Boundary Layer</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>The velocity in a turbulent boundary layer was measured with Particle Image Velocimetry simultaneously with the 
wall pressure using a 13 x 3 array of microphones at Re<sub><font size=2>theta</font></sub><font size=3> = 1520, 3950 and 6790. Velocity measurements spanned two 
boundary layer thickness, 2</font><font size=4><em> </em></font><font size=3><em>delta</em></font><font size=4>, </font><font size=3>in the streamwise direction and from the buffer layer to nearly <em>delta</em>, in the wall normal 
direction. The wall pressure spanned 1 <em>delta</em> in the streamwise direction. The instantaneous velocity fields show organized 
motions also observed in data bases of Direct Numerical Simulations performed at lower Reynolds numbers. The shear 
layer structure is present in many of the realizations and the slope of the interface that divides low and high streamwise 
momentum flow ranges from 20&#186; when the shear layer is confined to the near wall region (<em>y</em></font><sup><font size=2><em>+</em></font></sup><font size=3> &lt; 100) to 45&#186; when spanning 
several hundred <em>y</em></font><sup><font size=2><em>+</em></font></sup><font size=3>. The shear layer interface is characterized by multiple vortex-like structures. Negative total vorticity, 
typically on the order of <em>omega</em></font><sub><font size=2><em>z</em></font></sub><font size=3> </font><sup><font size=2>+</font></sup><font size=3>&lt; -0.07, is distributed along the interface; however, only localized areas exist where there 
is significant levels of negative Reynolds Stress product, <em>u'v' </em>&lt; -3 <em>utau</em></font><sup><font size=2>2 </font></sup><font size=2>. </font><font size=3>The characteristic wall pressure signature of a 
shear layer consists of consecutive negative and positive pressures composing a local adverse <em>dp/dx</em>. It is estimated that the 
structures associated with this wall-pressure signature convects at a speed of 0.5 <em>U</em></font><sub><font size=2><em>inf</em></font></sub><font size=3> (12<em> utau</em>) with the positive pressure 
peak preceding the negative pressure peak by some eight viscous time units (<em>t</em></font><sup><font size=2><em>+</em></font></sup><font size=3> = 8). Tracking some of these structures 
shows that they may convect large distances, on the order of <em>delta</em>.</font></p>

<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>Corrosion continues to cost over 4% of the Gross National Product of most industrialized countries. In the U.S. 
alone, the cost is more than $200 billion annually. Judicious application of existing corrosion control technology would trim 
roughly 15% from that total; worldwide activity to develop additional corrosion control technologies continues at a rapid 
pace.</p>
<p>Understanding the many variables that contribute to a corrosion process is necessary to develop an effective corrosion 
control strategy. The purpose of this seminar is to present a series of vignettes that describe basic corrosion principles and 
apply them to the solution of everyday corrosion problems. The areas to be covered are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Uniform Corrosion (galvanneal steel wall stud example, et al)</li>
<li>Localized Corrosion (underdeposit corrosion example, et al)</li>
<li>Galvanic Corrosion (edge rust in galvanized steel example, et al)</li>
<li>Intergranular Corrosion (sensitized stainless steel example, et al)</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong>"The Work of Engineering Schools: An Organization Shift for 21st Century Education and Research"</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>
Engineering education is in the midst of a transforming shift that began 
at the beginning of the last quarter of the present century.  While the 
curriculum retains the structure and pedagogy of the mid-20th Century, 
concern for its long-term viability and utility has risen in the face of 
an altered over arching external framework.  The seminar will discuss the 
following key elements for the future of engineering education:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Major trends in technology and engineering since the 19th Century</li>
<li>The paradox of the 1990s in engineering education</li>
<li>Key questions for the curriculum and the organization to support it</li>
<li>What needs to be done in the schools and for the faculty</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong> Fuel Cells for Utility and Electric Vehicle Applications: Are They Technically Viable? Will They Be Commercially Viable?</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong> During recent decades there has been a sustained effort, worldwide, to develop fuel cells, operating on natural gas or coal gas, for decentralized power generation and cogeneration.  This effort, based largely on U.S. technology but vigorously pursued by Japan and many European countries as well, is driven by economic as well as environmental factors.  Almost 100 phosphoric acid fuel cell plants, which work at 390 F, are in operation all over the world, and three pivotal demonstrations of 100-KW to 2-MW units of advanced types of high-temperature fuel cells are scheduled, two of which are taking place in California this year.  These advanced high-temperature fuel cells are the molten carbonate fuel cell, operating at 1200 F, and the solid-oxide fuel cell, at 1800 F, both capable of 55-60% chemical-to-electrical efficiency.  Building on the technical successes in theis emerging technology, car manufacturers are now showing strong interest in low-temperature fuel cells such as the polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cell, which operates on hydrogen or on reformed methanol at temperatures from 180 F up. </p>
<p> In the development of fuel cells beyond the lab stage, electrochemistry, chemical engineering and materials engineering play a major role.  New materials are needed for electrolyte and electodes.  The design and operation of effective electodes requires analysis of the interaction between chemical kinetics, mass transfer, heat transfer, and properties <em> in situ </em> (for example by AC impedance measurements) is a challenge. </p>
<p> Beyond the technical challenge, today's first need is to define and expand the market for fuel cells, and to find the capital to finance "traveling down the learning curve".  Some key aspects in the effort to bring fuel cells to commercial reality, especially their potential role in electric vehicles, will be discussed. </p>

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong>Exact Solutions in Compressible Finite Elasticity</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>The constraint of incompressibility has led to the discovery of several exact solutions in isotropic finite elasticity, 
most notably the controllable or universal solutions of Rivlin and others. Ericksen has examined the problem of finding all 
such solutions. He has also proved that there are no controllable finite deformations in isotropic compressible elasticity, 
except for homogeneous deformations.</p>
<p>In this talk some related questions are examined for three special classes of compressible isotropic elastic materials, one of 
which is the class of harmonic materials. Several closed form solutions, similar to the Rivlin solutions, are obtained. In 
particular, some classes of controllable deformations are addressed, with rather surprising results. For instance, it is shown 
that every harmonic scalar function generates a deformation that is controllable for harmonic materials. Finally, analysis of 
the controllability conditions suggests that the three classes of strain energy functions considered may be the only ones for 
which results of this type can be obtained.</p>

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong> Hypereutectic Al-Si Alloy Casting Technology and Its Potential</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>
The typical hypereutectic Al-Si alloy freezes over a relatively 
wide temperature range and is characterized by (1) a high thermal 
diffusivity and (2) a high heat of fusion, both of which tend to minimize 
temperature gradients, expand the range where liquid and solid coexists 
in the mushy state, and upon solidifications lead to unfed shrinkage 
sites (i.e. microporosity) to be dispersed throughout the casting. 
Four-cycle engine blocks made with these alloys typically exhibit high 
oil consumption because of the microporosity.
</p>
<p>
	This presentation examines Mercury Marines patented Mercosil 
Engine Block Technology that solves the problems of the past associated 
with the wide solidification range. The patented Mercosil composition is 
a wear resistant, easily cast, hypereutectic Al-Si alloy of narrow 
solidification range that solidifies with an improved primary silicon 
distribution and an absence of microporosity. A higher silicon content 
version of Mercosil is also patented. This alloy composition has twice 
the wear resistance of Mercosil, and allows automotive the option of not 
having to etch the bores. Because this alloy has a  solidus melting point 
100F higher than conventional hypereutectic Al-Si alloys, the alloy has 
significant potential as a cast-in aluminum alloy liner. Mercury, in 
addition, has patented a high magnesium content version of Mercosil that 
is specifically designed for the lost Foam Casting Process. The alloy 
eliminates the liquid styrene defect and has great potential for 
defect-free automotive Lost Foam engine blocks. The alloy has particular 
value to Mercury Marine in its outboard business because Mercury has also 
patented the two-cycle engine block made by the Lost Foam Casting Process.

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong> A Stabilized Space-Time Formulation of the Navier-Stokes Equations for Moving Domain Problems </p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>
A space-time finite element formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations
is presented for the analysis of flows over moving and deforming domains.
The variational equation is based on time discontinuous Galerkin method 
and employs the physical entropy variables. A least-squares operator is 
added to the formulation to improve the stability of the method and 
to account for unresolved internal and boundary layers. In this 
formulation the elements can be oriented in time to accommodate the 
spatial deformations.  If they are oriented along the particle paths,
the method is Lagrangian and if they are held fixed in time, it is Eulerian.
Consequently this formulation is analogous to the arbitrary 
Lagrangian-Eulerian techniques. 
Exploiting the idea of arbitrary orientation in time of the space-time
elements, a novel mesh rezoning technique is proposed.
This technique  adapts the fluid mesh to the moving domain with 
deforming boundaries. The approach is quite general and can be applied
to structured and unstructured meshes.
Numerical results are presented to show the performance of the method.

<p> The MMAE Department at the Illinois Institute of Technology 
offers the Bachelor of Science degrees in Mechanical 
Engineering (B.S.M.E.), Metallurgical and Materials Engineering 
(B.S.M.M.E.), and Aerospace Engineering (B.S.A.E.). These 
degree programs are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation 
Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and 
Technology (ABET). All three programs build upon a strong 
foundation in mathematics and basic sciences, the humanities 
and social sciences, and a balance of engineering topics in the 
respective disciplines; include innovative engineering 
activities and opportunities for undergraduate students; and 
are responsive to the changing needs of industry. The aim is to 
educate individuals for professional careers in engineering and 
to provide the basis for life-long learning and advanced study 
at the graduate level.</p>


<p>In recognition of the changing professional environment in 
which IIT뇹 graduates will function, the MMAE Department 
programs place substantial emphasis on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>teaching students to understand the economic, ethical, 
societal, environmental and international context of their professional activities,</li> 
<li>improving oral and written
communication skills,</li>
 <li>training students to work in 
multidisciplinary teams,</li>
<li>  preparing students for the 
interprofessional work force of the 21st century,</li>
<li> enhancing 
students abilities to link science and engineering principles 
to key technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students are introduced to the scope of 
the engineering profession in the first year courses 
Introduction to the Professions I and II, and to the ethical, 
economical, safety, environmental and other responsibilities of 
being a professional engineer. Strong emphasis is placed on 
development of oral and written communication skills. 
Accompanying courses in mathematics and the basic sciences 
provide the foundation for later studies of engineering 
sciences relevant to the students major fields of study. These 
areas include: energy and structures for the ME major; 
materials, processes and their selection, and plant design for 
the MME major; and structures and materials, propulsion and 
aerodynamics for the AE major.</p>
<p> The second year emphasizes 
building a foundation for the eventual study of engineering 
design. The engineering sciences offer a rational approach to 
solving detailed problems encountered in major-specific 
courses, including the capstone design courses, of the third 
and fourth years. The student뇹 professional experience is 
developed by participation in interprofessional projects in the 
second, third and fourth years.</p>
<p> In the third year, students 
begin the transition to professional practice and learn to 
develop sound engineering judgment by studying open ended 
problems and realistic constraints. Students build further on 
the engineering sciences and approximately one-third of 
major-specific course work is devoted to the introduction of 
tangible engineering design.</p> 
<p>The process continues into the 
fourth year where the metallurgical and materials program 
culminates in one and the mechanical and aerospace engineering 
programs culminate in two senior year capstone design courses. 
Mechanical engineering projects involve design of thermal and 
mechanical systems, metallurgical and materials engineering 
students develop new or optimized materials, processing routes 
and selection schemes, and aerospace engineering students 
produce conceptual designs of aircraft and spacecraft.</p>

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong>An Introduction to Metal Injection Molding "Plastic Metals"</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong> Metal Injection Molding is a powder processing technology that has developed commercially within the last 15-20 years.  The advantages of the technology, is that complex parts that were once machined or cast, can now be processed to near net shape.  The cost reductions thus obtained can approach 30-50%. </p>
<p> The process consists of mixing fine metal powders with a polymer/wax binder carrier and subsequently molding the material into a specially designed die or tool.  The crux of the process is to remove the binder, whose only purpose is to allow the powders to be injected into the die, and sinter at temperatures ranging from 2200 F - 2400 F to levels approaching 95% of full wrought densities.  At present carbon steels, stainless steels, tool steels and non-ferrous alloys such as copper have been developed for gun parts, medical devices, automotive applications and computer peripherals such as heat sinks.</p>
<p> Details of the process will be discussed in the context of the other forming processes such as machining, casting and forming; and a contrast will be drawn when comparing MIM to the classical powder metallurgy processes.  Examples of parts produced by MIM will be shown. </p>

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong> The Deformation of Martensite</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>
	Several unexpected effects are observed when as-quenched 
martensites in carbon and alloy steels are deformed. Die drawing these 
steels results in dramatic strength increases, introduction of a yield 
point phenomena, decrease in electrical resistivity, sharpening of 
(110)x-ray diffraction lines and others. Tempering effects are also 
unusual. The findings are consistent with a soft martensite concept in 
which rapidly occurring carbon-vacancy interaction accompanies deformation.

<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong>Novel Chemically Bonded Phosphate Ceramics For Stabilizing Low-Level Mixed Wastes.</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>
Novel chemically bonded phosphate ceramics have been developed by 
acid-base reactions between magnesium oxide and an acid phosphate for 
stabilizing U.S. Department of Energy's low-level mixed waste streams.  
The acid-base reaction slurry formed a monolithic crystalline ceramic at 
room temperature.  Using these chemically bonded phosphate matrices, 
low-level mixed waste streams were stabilized that formed superior waste 
forms in a monolithic structure.  The final waste forms showed low open 
porosity and permeability, and one order of magnitude higher compression 
strength than the LDR.  Using this stabilization technology, operational 
size (55 gal.) monolithics were formed without losing physical 
integrity.  The hazardous contaminants in waste streams, such as RCRA 
heavy metals (Hg,Pb,Cd,Cr,Ni,etc) as well as radioactive elements (Ce as 
a surrogate of U and Pu), are chemically fixed by phosphate and 
physically encapsulated by phosphate ceramics.  These results on uranium 
were confirmed using uranium contaminated waste and waste water.

While our understanding of phase transformations is ever
increasing, the ability of industry to use this information is going in the
opposite direction. The two cultures are diverging rather than converging.
Solution paths to some current industrial materials problems are suggested
based upon what the speaker knows about materials.

<b><u></u>I.  INTRODUCTION  </b><p>
<b></b><p>
This guide serves as a supplement to the IIT Graduate Bulletin of Programs and
as a checklist for graduate students in regard to the Mechanical, Materials and
Aerospace Engineering (MMAE) Department's procedural requirements and
deadlines.  Deadlines are established by the Graduate School, and are also
listed in the current IIT Graduate Bulletin.  The Graduate Student Handbook,
which is usually distributed by mail or at the registration for each semester,
is another university publication that discusses the university's academic
policies for graduate students and  answers students' most frequently asked
questions.  It is the student's responsibility, with guidance from his/her
adviser, to follow the procedures, and meet the specified deadlines. These
deadlines are not flexible and failure to meet them will result in postponement
of the student's graduation.<p>
<p>
The MMAE faculty have the ultimate responsibility for the comprehensive
departmental program.  The Chairman of the Department, Professor Marek Dollar,
with consultation from the faculty, appoints at least six faculty members from
different specialized areas of study to serve on the Graduate Studies
Committee.  The Graduate Studies Committee approves all ordinary procedural
matters, which include the student's Program of Study and appointments of
committees to evaluate student examinations.  When extraordinary changes in
degree programs or in departmental policies appear desirable, the Graduate
Studies Committee will make recommendations to the faculty for discussion and
approval. Leadership of the committee is the responsibility of the appointed
Chairman, Professor David Williams, and Co-Chairman, Professor Philip Nash.
The chairman, with assistance from the co-chairman handles the day-to-day
obligations of the graduate studies program, including graduate admissions and
new student advising.  Appointments to the Graduate Studies Committee are made
for a one year period, and are renewable on a year to year basis.  The
committee will usually meet once a month for the duration of the academic
year.<p>
<p>
The MMAE department offers graduate programs in <b>Mechanical and Aerospace
Engineering (MAE)</b>  leading to: <p><UL>
&#183;	Master of  Science in mechanical and aerospace engineering (MSMAE),<br>
&#183;	Master of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MEMAE) and<br>
&#183;	Doctor of Philosophy in mechanical and aerospace engineering.   </UL>
The department also offers graduate studies in <b>Metallurgical and Materials
Engineering (METM) </b>leading to:<p><UL>
&#183;	Master of Science in metallurgical and materials engineering (MSMETM)
<br>
&#183;	Master of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering (MEMETM) and <br>
&#183;	Doctor of Philosophy in metallurgical and materials engineering. </UL>
In addition, the department offers interdisciplinary programs leading to :<p><UL>
&#183;	Master of Science in manufacturing engineering  (MSMFG) and<br>
&#183;	Master of Manufacturing Engineering (MEMFG).</UL>

<a name="1.0"></a>
<b>1.  GENERAL OPERATING PROCEDURES</b><p>
<a name="1.1"></a>
<b>1.1  Registration Procedures</b><p>
<b></b>The Schedule of Classes for each semester is available at the end of the
previous semester and is mailed to continuing students.  This Schedule also
serves as an excellent guide to registration procedures.  <p>
<p>
Graduate students normally register for classes during arena registration (held
the week preceding the beginning of each semester).  New graduate students can
pick up their registration forms in the MMAE office, Room 243-E1, usually on
the Monday of registration week.  Continuing full-time students should receive
their forms by mail and may register in advance in April (for fall semester) or
November (for spring semester).  Those students who do not receive their
registration forms in the mail should contact the Registrar Office.  Students
who have not submitted a Program of Study prior to completing twelve credit
hours, or those who owe tuition or fees, will have their registration forms
withheld until such matters have been settled.  Students are urged to inform
the Registrar's Office of any change of address.<p>
<p>
Registration forms, once signed by the student and his/her adviser, are to be
submitted to the MMAE Office for the department chairman's approval.  The
student then takes the approved form to arena registration. Any changes made
after the approval will require the additional signature of the student's
adviser and the department chair. Students who cannot attend arena registration
should either pre-register or make arrangements for someone to register for
them.<p>
<p>
Graduate students receiving financial assistance are required to submit
approved registration forms (signed by the student and his/her adviser) to the
MMAE office no later than July 20th (for fall semester) or January 5th (for
spring semester).  Tuition vouchers will be prepared and attached to the
registration forms for approval by the department chair, the college dean, and
the dean of the Graduate College.  The department secretary will obtain these
signatures, provided that students submit their approved registration form
before the above listed deadline.  Approved registration forms and tuition
vouchers can then be picked up just prior to the start of the full-time
graduate students' arena registration session.  All students receiving
financial assistance from the MMAE department must be working towards a Master
of Science or a Doctor of Philosophy degree. <p>
<b></b><p>
<a name="1.2"></a>
<b>1.2 Special Graduate Student Status</b><b></b><p>
<b></b>A student who has not obtained admission to the Graduate School may seek
to register as a special graduate student.  Special graduate students must
complete a Special Student Application and submit an official transcript of all
previous undergraduate and graduate work to the Graduate Records Office. The
minimum requirements for permission to register, set by the Graduate School,
are a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution and a GPA of 2.5/4.0 or
equivalent.  Foreign students with F-1 visas issued by IIT may not be enrolled
as special graduate students.  Special graduate students may enroll for a
maximum of nine credit hours per semester.  All special graduate student
applicants planning to take MAE courses must obtain the approval of the Chair
of the MMAE Department Graduate Studies Committee.<p>
<p>
An applicant who is denied admission to the MMAE department's graduate program
may be allowed to enroll as a Special Graduate Student, if the department
believes that the applicant merits a chance to demonstrate his/her ability to
succeed in the program.  The department reserves the right to review and
approve or deny the application of any person who wishes to enroll in a
department course.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>A special graduate student must complete a minimum of six credit hours
of graduate coursework (maintaining a GPA of 3.0 or better) before the MMAE
department will reconsider his/her application for admission as a regular
graduate student.  Note that maintaining the minimum GPA requirement does not
guarantee admission to the MMAE department's graduate program.  Applications
for change of status from Special to Regular Graduate Student must be
accompanied by<b><i> Form #401, Program of Study </i></b>(sample available on
page 17), signed by a faculty member who is willing to serve as the student's
adviser.  The Graduate Studies Committee will then review the program of study
as part of the student's application for regular admission. No more than nine
credit hours of coursework taken as a special graduate student may be applied
towards the student's program of study.<p>
<b></b><p>
<a name="1.3"></a>
<b>1.3 Leave of Absence</b><p>
Students admitted to regular status are expected to maintain continued
registration (excluding summer semester) until graduation unless they are
granted a leave of absence from the Dean of the Graduate School.  For this
purpose, use<b><i> Form 216, Request for Leave of Absence, </i></b>(sample
available on  page 19). A student who withdraws without permission, or who lets
a granted leave of absence expire, must  apply to the department  for
readmission.  If less than three years has lapsed since the student registered,
readmission normally requires a letter of endorsement from the student's
adviser to the Dean of the Graduate School.  For absences of three years or
more, a new application and supporting documents (transcripts, letters of
recommendation) are required.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<a name="1.4"></a>
<b>1.4 Department Financial Assistance Policy</b><p>
The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering has a limited number of
teaching assistantships available to graduate students in the department who
show a high potential for success in the programs and have necessary teaching
skills.  Applications (sample available on page 20) can be obtained from the
Department Secretary.  The Department Chairman awards these assistantships to
the most qualified students for a certain period of time during their degree
programs.  This period of support is determined by the Chairman for each
individual case.  In order to make these awards to as many deserving students
as possible, teaching assistantships are awarded for the maximum number of
semesters as follows:<p><UL>
&#183;	Master of Science Students: 3 semesters<br>
&#183;	Doctor of Philosophy students: 4 semesters<br>
&#183;	Ph.D.  students with a master's degree from IIT: 5 semesters</UL>
<p>
Only Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degree students are eligible
for teaching assistantships.  The availability of these assistantships is
dependent upon the needs of the department.  After this assistantship has been
used, a teaching assistant who is performing well may then  be supported by
his/her adviser as a research assistant.   The student is encouraged to pursue
a research assistantship as early in the program as possible.<p>
<p>
IIT's Financial Aid Office offers a limited program of financial assistance, in
the form of work opportunities and loans, to graduate students.  Consult the
IIT Bulletin or contact the Student Finance Center at 312/567-3303 for further
information.<p>

<b>1.5  Advising Procedures</b><p>
<b></b>The Chair of the Graduate Studies Committee serves as the temporary
adviser to all new mechanical and aerospace engineering graduate students.  The
Co-Chair of the Graduate Studies Committee serves as a temporary adviser to all
new metallurgical and materials engineering graduate students.  In many cases
the chairman and co-chairman serve as permanent advisers to part-time students.
All students are required to find a permanent adviser and submit a Program of
Study to the MMAE office before the beginning of the second semester for
full-time students<a href="guide_fn.html#p3fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>, or before enrollment
beyond 12 credit hours for part-time students.  All graduate students are
advised to leave changes to their mailing addresses and/or telephone numbers
with the MMAE department secretary.<p>
<p>
Students should consult with their advisers as early as possible, in order to
choose their courses.  Students registering for any of the following courses
should use their adviser's identification number as the section number when
registering:<p><UL>

<b><center>1. PROGRAM OF STUDY</b><p>
<b></center></b>The student selects courses, with guidance from his/her
adviser, and submits a Program of Study signed by  his/her adviser to the MMAE
office before the beginning of the second semester or before completing 12
credit hours. <b><i>Form #401, Program of Study, </i> </b>(sample available on
page 17), is employed for this purpose.  The Program of Study form once
approved by the adviser also requires the approval of the Graduate Studies
Committee and the signatures of the Chairman of the Department, and the dean of
the Graduate School. Once a student has filed an approved program of study,
deviation from the plan requires the same signatures on <b><i>Form #406, Change
in previously approved Program of Study,</i></b> (sample available on page 21)
as the original plan of  study.  After the student has chosen a permanent
adviser, to change advisers, it is necessary to complete F<b>orm #410,
</b>Change of Adviser (sample available on page 22).<p>
<p>
All full-time MMAE students must register each semester for either MAE 593
(Department Seminar Series for mechanical and aerospace engineering students)
or METM 593 (Department Seminar Series for metallurgical and materials
students.  Both seminars are no fee, no credit classes, but registration and
attendance for one hour a week is mandatory.  The seminar is a pass or fail
class and will be graded on attendance.  A student will receive a passing grade
if he/she attends a minimum of 80% of the seminars offered in that semester.

<b>2. COMPLETION OF STUDIES &amp; GRADUATION</b><p>
<b></b>Once a student successfully completes the coursework and thesis research
(if applicable) as outlined in his/her Program of Study,  the student files
an<b> <i>Application for Graduation,</i> <i>Form #527</i></b> (sample available
on page 23) with the Graduate Records Office, within two weeks of the start of
the intended graduation semester. The application is valid only in the semester
in which it is filed.  If the student fails to graduate in the intended
semester, then a new application must be filed for a later semester.<p>
<p>
After the application is filed, the Graduate College will mail to the
graduating student <i>The Sequence of Events and Deadlines</i>, applicable to
that semester. The student's adviser, using <b><i>MMAE Form #101</i>, <i>A
Request for Appointment of Committee</i></b> (sample available on page 24)<i>
</i> recommends, and the Graduate Studies Committee approves, the appointment
of  a Thesis Review and Examination Committee (T.R.E.C.) for M.S. students,  or
an Examination Committee for M.E. students.  The committee consists of at least
three faculty members<a href="guide_fn.html#p8fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> whose purpose is to
evaluate the student's thesis (M.S.) or  non-thesis project assignment (M.E.),
and the  comprehensive examination. It is the student's responsibility to
ensure that the request for appointment is made.<p>
<p>
<A NAME="M2.1"></A>
<b>2.1  Master of Science Candidates </b><p>
<b>       Thesis and Comprehensive Examination Procedures</b><p>
<b></b>A mandatory  thesis preparation discussion is held early each semester
by the Graduate College to assist students in preparing their thesis and
alerting them to problems that may occur. The MMAE student's thesis must
conform to the guidelines given in the latest IIT Thesis Manual (complimentary
copies of the Thesis Manual will be distributed at the meeting). The Thesis
Manual can be purchased in the IIT Bookstore.<p>
<p>
The student prepares a preliminary draft of his/her thesis, at least five weeks
before graduation, and obtains the signature approval from his/her adviser,
each T.R.E.C. member, the department chair<a href="guide_fn.html#p8fn8"><sup>8</sup></a>
and the Graduate School Thesis Examiner using <b><i>Form #501A, Preliminary
Thesis Approval Form</i> </b>(sample available on page 25).  The Thesis
Examiner is available to the students for guidance in order to meet the
requirements set out in the Thesis Manual.   The student's initial appointment
with the Thesis Examiner must be made at least six weeks before the end of the
anticipated graduation semester.  The Thesis Examiner's schedule, phone number
and office location is posted in the Graduate College.  Meetings are by
appointment only.  <p>
<p>
At least seven days prior to the comprehensive examination, the student
distributes copies of the approved thesis draft to the T.R.E.C. members.
His/her adviser then sends a memo to all MMAE faculty members announcing the
place and time of the examination.  This memo should include an abstract of the
thesis.  It is the student's responsibility to ensure that this memo is sent on
time.  Failure to do so will result in the rescheduling of the examination.<p>
<p>
T.R.E.C. conducts a comprehensive oral examination on the student's thesis and
related areas. <a href="guide_fn.html#p8fn9"><sup>9</sup></a> This examination is
scheduled at a mutually convenient time and date, but must be taken at least
fifteen days prior to the end of the semester.  The adviser reports the results
of the examination to the department using <b><i>MMAE Form #103, Results of
Master's Comprehensive Examination </i></b>(sample available on page 26)
<b><i>and  Form #303, Master's Comprehensive/ Ph.D. Qualifying
Exam</i></b>(sample available on page 27).  <p>
<p>
The student obtains signature approvals of the final thesis draft from his/her
adviser, T.R.E.C. members, and the department chair on <b><i>Form #501B, Final
Thesis Approval,  </i></b>(sample available on page 25). The student pays the
advanced degree fee at the Bursar's office. At least 9 days before
commencement, the student meets with the Thesis Examiner for final thesis
approval with three unbound copies of the completed thesis in marked manila
envelopes with original signature of adviser on title pages, a Bursar's receipt
showing payment of fee, and<b> <i>Form #50lB</i></b> bearing all approval
signatures except the final Thesis Examiner's.<p>
<p>
Note:  Three copies of the thesis are required and after binding the library,
department archives, and adviser each receives a copy.  The Graduate School
will not provide binding  for more than three copies, but the student is urged
to get his/her own private copy bound at the IIT Office Services or
elsewhere.<p>
<p>
As a result of the completion of courses and the above mentioned efforts, the
student graduates and is awarded an M.S. Degree.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<A NAME="M2.2"></A>
<b>2.2  Master of Engineering Candidates</b><p>
<b>       Non-Thesis Project and Comprehensive Examination</b><p>
The adviser assigns the student a non-thesis project at least three weeks prior
to the comprehensive exam, and informs the examination committee of the
assignment. This assignment, while concentrating on the major area, may draw
upon the student's ability to apply the concepts of any or all of his/her
course-work. Students who have taken MAE or METM 594 or a 5x9 course (with the
exception of 509 &amp; 529) and wish to use their topics as the assignment may
do so with the approval of their advisor.<p>
<p>
At least seven days prior to the comprehensive exam, the student submits a
written report on the assignment (approved by his/her adviser) to each
Comprehensive Examination Committee members. The adviser sends a memo to all
MMAE faculty members, announcing the time and place of the exam.  This memo may
include a short abstract of the student's report. <p>
<p>
The comprehensive exam is an oral examination on the student's assignment
and/or related areas.<a href="guide_fn.html#p9fn10"><sup>10 </sup></a>  The student must also have available at
the time of the oral examination, a written draft of the assignment.  The
deadline for the comprehensive examination is one week prior to the last date
to report the comprehensive examination results.  The result of the oral
examination is reported by the adviser to the department on <b><i>MMAE Form
#103, Result of the Master's Comprehensive Examination </i></b>(example
available on page 26). <b> </b>The student then makes any minor corrections or
changes in the report that the comprehensive examination committee finds
necessary.  If major corrections or revisions are necessary, the student is
considered to have failed the examination.<a href="guide_fn.html#p9fn11"><sup>11</sup></a>
The student obtains the adviser's final approval of the assignment by signing
the <b><i>Form #303, Master's Comprehensive/Ph.D. Qualifying Examination
</i></b>(example available on page 27).  The student brings one copy of the
final report (for the departmental archives) and the signed <b><i>Form
#303</i></b> to the department chair.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>As a result of the completion of courses and the above mentioned
efforts, the student graduates and is awarded an  M.E. Degree.<p>
<p>
Note: The Master of Engineering Programs in Mechanical and Aerospace
Engineering; and Metallurgical and Materials Engineering are being
significantly revised.  The new programs will be in effect for August 1996.
Changes were made to the programs in order to better accommodate the working
professional.<p>

<b></b><p>
<a name="PHD"></a>
<b>III. Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)</b><b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<i></i><p>
<i><center>The doctorate is awarded upon achievement of a high degree of
mastery in a field of knowledge and upon demonstration of a distinct ability to
make substantial creative contributions to that field.  The Ph.D. is not
awarded merely as a result of specific courses taken or of years spent in study
or research; the quality of work and the resourcefulness of the student must be
such that the faculty is convinced that the student will be capable of a
continuing effort toward the advancement of knowledge and continuing
achievement in research and other scholarly activities.	</i><p>
<i></center>IIT Graduate Bulletin of Programs  1994 -1996</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<A NAME="P1.0"></A>
<i></i><b>1. PROGRAM OF STUDY</b><p>
<b></b>The Ph.D. candidate will have met the requirements for a master's degree
or presented evidence that he/she has reached the equivalent level of
proficiency.  Students who have earned a Master's degree from IIT and wish to
pursue a doctorate must reapply to the Graduate School through the Graduate
Admissions Office. Work for the Ph.D. generally takes a minimum of three years
beyond the bachelor's degree (or six semesters of registration for at least 16
credit hours of graduate work each semester for a total of at least 96 credit
hours).  Some of the work done towards a master's degree in the same field may
apply toward satisfying the requirements for the Ph.D.<p>
<p>
Students who wish to transfer a Master's degree from another U.S. institution
should be prepared to provide course descriptions and/or syllabi to the
Graduate Studies Committee.  Students who wish to transfer a master's degree
from an international university must petition the MMAE Graduate Studies
Committee and should be prepared to provide appropriate documentation.
Documentation includes, but is not limited to, transcripts, catalogues with
course descriptions, course syllabi, and letters of endorsement from
individuals in the field who are familiar with the university and its programs.
The Graduate Studies Committee will evaluate the student's transcripts and
supporting documentation to determine how many transfer credits should be
awarded, according to IIT standards.<p>
<p>
The student selects a permanent adviser, (MAE students must also choose a major
and a minor from the four area of study)  and submits a program of study on<i>
<b> Form #401, Program of Study </b></i>(sample available on page 17) to the
MMAE office. (For a guide to developing an MAE Ph.D. Program of Study, see page
11; for a METM Ph.D. Program of Study, see page 12). Doctoral candidates who
have earned a master's degree must file a program of study before beginning the
second semester or before completing 12 credit hours. Doctoral candidates
without a master's degree must file an approved program of study within 16
months after initial enrollment or before completing 36 credit hours in the
Ph.D. program.<p>
<p>
The student's permanent adviser will help the student formulate an overall plan
of study, including coursework, reading, independent study and possibly a plan
of research.  A significant portion of the Program of Study is devoted to
independent research leading to a dissertation.  Each student must include the
equivalent of at least two semesters of full-time study devoted to research.
Semesters need not be consecutive.<p>
<p>
The Program of Study requires approval of the student's adviser, the Graduate
Studies Committee, the Department Chair, and the dean of the Graduate School.
Once a program of study is approved, any proposed changes must be submitted to
the Graduate Studies Committee on <b><i> Form #406, Change in Previously
Approved Program of Study,</i></b> (sample available on page
21).<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><p>
<b></b>All full-time MMAE students must register each semester for either MAE
593 (Department Seminar Series for mechanical and aerospace engineering
students) or METM 593 (Department Seminar Series for metallurgical and
materials students.  Both seminars are no fee, no credit classes, but
registration and attendance for one hour a week is mandatory.  The seminar is a
pass or fail class and will be graded on attendance.  A student will receive a
passing grade if he/she attends a minimum of 80% of the seminars offered in
that semester.  <p>

<p>
A request for the appointment of the Comprehensive Examination  Committee
should be made by the adviser on <b><i> MMAE Form #101, Request for Appointment
of Committee, </i></b>(sample available on page 24) so that it can be acted
upon by the Graduate Studies Committee.  Once the Graduate Studies Committee
approves the makeup of the committee,<i> <b>Form #301,</b> <b>Appointment of
Ph.D. </b></i><b>Committee</b> (sample available on page 29) is used to notify
the dean of the Graduate School of the exam and must be submitted no later than
two weeks prior to the exam date.<b>  </b>The Department Chair will not sign
<b><i>Form #301</i></b> without an approved thesis proposal.  The results of
the Comprehensive Examination should be reported to the Graduate College on
<b><i>Form # 309</i></b> (sample available on page 28), by the student's
advisor in the presence of all members of the Comprehensive Examination
Committee, and should be returned to the dean of the Graduate College within 48
hours.<p>
<p>
The student files an <b><i>Application for Graduation, Form #527,</i></b>
(sample available on page 23) at the beginning of the semester in which he/she
expects to graduate.  This application is valid only for the semester in which
it is filed and must be refiled in the event that the student's graduation is
delayed.<p>
<p>
<A NAME="P3.3"></A>
<b>3.3 Ph.D. Thesis Review &amp; Defense Examination Committee</b><p>
As the student nears completion of his/her dissertation, a Ph.D. Thesis Review
and Defense Examination Committee is appointed.  <p>

<h2><a name="WHATIS"></a>What is LDA?</h2>

<p>LDA (formerly ACLD, the Association for Children and Adults with 
Learning Disabilities) was formed in 1964 by a group of concerned parents
on behalf of children with learning disabilities. 
LDA is the only national organization devoted to defining and 
finding solutions for the broad spectrum of learning disabilities.

<p>LDA is the largest non-profit volunteer organization advocating for
individuals with learning disabilities. LDA has 50 state affiliates and 
more than 600 local chapters in 50 states, Washington DC, and Puerto Rico.
Membership totals more than 50,000. The membership, composed of
individuals with learning disabilities, family members and concerned
professionals, advocates for the over two million students of school age
with learning disabilities and for adults affected with learning
disabilities. The state and local chapters, through their affiliation
with the National LDA, work continuously for individuals with learning
disabilities, their parents and the professionals who serve them.

<hr width="75%">

<h2><a name="GOALS"></a>What are LDA's Goals?</h2>

<ul>
<li>LDA seeks to educate individuals with learning disabilities and their
parents about the nature of the disability and inform them of their rights.
</li>

<li>LDA encourages research in neuro-physiological and psychological aspects
of learning disabilities. </li>

<li>LDA strives to create a climate of public awareness and acceptance.
</li>

<li>LDA works to improve regular and special education through advocacy
with the U.S. Department of Education and the State Departments of Education
in each state. </li>

<li>LDA develops and promotes legislative assistance. </li>

<li>LDA disseminates information widely. </li>

<li>LDA provides advocacy information and training. </li>

<li>LDA works to establish career opportunities. </li>

<li>LDA promotes education and training on learning disabilities for special
education and regular education teachers. </li>
</ul>

<p>LDA accomplishes its goals and objectives through its national 
<a href="committees.html">committees</a>
on advocacy, adult issues, education, legislation, early childhood, research,
communications/outreach. The board and committees are composed primarily
of volunteer parents and individuals with learning disabilities, but its
strength also springs from its close affiliation with professionals in
the field, including the Professional Advisory Board, which offers counsel
on professional and technical areas. Another source of strength is the <a
href="acld.html">ACLD Foundation</a>, which provides funds for
research, education, and broadening the base of public awareness in the
field of learning disabilities.

<br>
<hr width="75%">

<h2><a name="SERVICES"></a>What services does LDA offer?</h2>

<p><b>LDA and Legislation</b><br>
LDA representatives testify at the request of Congress on matters
relating to special education. LDA holds and participates in numerous forums
on legal rights of individual students with learning disabilities. LDA
provides information and recommends action on pending legislation which
may affect individuals with learning disabilities and/or their families.

<p><b>LDA Information and Referral Network
<br></b>An inquiry to the local chapter, state office, or 
<a href="../Email.html">national LDA office</a> may be a critical first
step in providing help to a person with learning disabilities.

<p>LDA's unique information and referral system is the largest one of its
kind in the country serving individuals with learning disabilities. Other
organizations and agencies such as the National Center on Learning Disabilities,
the Orton Dyslexia Society, and state parent training centers refer inquiries
to the LDA nationwide network for in-depth education and support.

<p>Annually through the <a href="../conf/">International Conference</a>
and the state chapter conferences and workshops LDA provides a forum for
questions on learning disabilities and new technology and approaches for
teaching individuals with learning disabilities. Attendance at the conferences,
workshops, symposiums and support groups reaches 75,000 participants yearly.
Parents, teachers and other professionals and individuals with learning
disabilities are the participants that gather for education, networking,
and advocacy. 

<p><b>LDA and School Program Development
<br></b>LDA and its state affiliates are available to work directly with
school systems in planning and implementing programs for better services
for students with learning disabilities. LDA offers 
<a href="../conf/scholarship.html">scholarships</a>
annually to school principals for attendance to the International Conference.
This service has provided some 300 principals with an ongoing network of
information and support. In its national headquarters LDA maintains an
extensive <a href="../store/">inventory of books and materials</a>
covering every aspect of learning disabilities. These materials are ordered by
hundreds of schools, libraries and thousands of individuals with learning
disabilities. LDA publishes a journal, 
<b><i><a href="../Journal.html">Learning Disabilities: 
A Multidisciplinary Journal</a></i></b> twice a year.

<p>LDA and its state affiliates frequently work directly with school systems
in planning and implementing programs for early identification and diagnosis,
as well as remediation in resource and special education classroom situations.
Because of the relationship of learning disabilities to school drop-out
and delinquency, the <a href="committees.html#AI">Adult Issues
Committee</a>
works with educators, correctional authorities and jurists in order to
develop comprehensive approaches to education and employment. 
<br>
<hr width="75%">

<h2><a name="MEMBERSHIP"></a>Membership in LDA</h2>

<p>Members receive the national newsletter, <b><i><a
href="../newsbriefs/">Newsbriefs</a></i></b>,
six times a year, along with state and local chapter newsletters. Parents
learn how to advocate for their child and have access to support groups
and educational meetings. Parents learn about federal and state laws that
affect their child. They meet and share a common bond with other parents
and professionals who have similar concerns. Professionals have access
to the latest information relating to learning disabilities. Individuals
with learning disabilities learn how to understand the disability and advocate
for themselves through support groups and conferences.</p>

<p>You can help LDA achieve its vision of a world in which all
individuals with learning disabilities thrive and participate fully in
society and a world in which the causes of learning disabilities are
understood and addressed. Join LDA today!

are many terms associated with the teaching of reading.

topics:
<ol>

Continuing Education Opportunities<br>
Virginia Commonwealth University<br>Richmond, Virginia</h2>

For Professionals in Education, Psychology, Social Work, Counseling,
Vocational Rehabilitation, Nursing, and other areas, Continuing Education
Units (CEUs) will be available. Although NOT equivalent to university
undergraduate or graduate credits, CEUs are accepted by many local or
state agencies and professional associations as evidence of professional
growth activities for recertification or clock hours toward renewal.
Since there is a great variability among agencies and professions about if
and how CEUs are accepted, you should determine whether CEUs are
applicable in your individual situation PRIOR to coming to the conference.
The CEUs will be recorded on a Virginia Commonwealth University
transcript, which may be obtained without charge as often as requested. It
is up to the individual, however, to take responsibility for having a
transcript sent to the proper authorities.

<p>One CEU is defined as ten contact hours, so it is possible to earn a
total of 25 CEUs by attending all Conference sessions, Wednesday through
Saturday. A one-time processing fee of $20.00 will be charged regardless
of the number of CEUs earned at the LDA Conference. MasterCard or Visa
credit cards and personal checks may be used.

<p>IMPORTANT: A CEU table in the Conference Registration area will be open
from 7:30 to 9:00 a.m. each morning. To receive CEUs YOU MUST REGlSTER
BEFORE THE OPENING SESSION on the first day that you want CEUs. For
further information, please stop by the CEU desk before attending any
conference sessions.

<h3>W1<br>8:30 AM - 4:00 PM</h3>

<h2 align=center>Neuroimaging in Learning Disabilities<br>and
Developmental Disorders</h2>
The area of neuroimaging is developing methods to visualize brain areas
in functioning states. Procedures for functional stimulation permit
differentiation between control and learning disabled brain function.
Specific methods and specific probes are providing new views of the
functioning and dysfunctional brain, but expectations and limitations
must be kept in sharp perspective. 
 
<p><b>Session Leader:<br>
Kenneth Bonnet, Ph.D.,</b> New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY

<p><b>Presenters:<br>
Kenneth Pugh, Ph.D.</b>, Yale University, New Haven, CT<br>
<b>Malcolm Cooper, M.D.</b>, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL<br>
<b>B.J. Casey, Ph.D.</b>, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA<br>
<b>Jay Giedd, M.D.</b>, National Institute of Mental Health, National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD<br>
<b>Tomas Paus, M.D., Ph.D.</b>, Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, Canada

<p>Functional MRI is providing new information about areas of the brain
normally and abnormally involved in the processing of sensory
information, social competence and of verbal and nonverbal learning.
Brain imaging has provided anatomical insights into the areas where
learning disabilities can occur. Some learning disabilities are well
known, but  until recently have had no established neurological or
anatomical basis. This panel of presenters represents leadership in the
technological ability to functionally localize brain areas of unusual
development that underlie verbal and nonverbal learning disabilities and
attention deficits. 

<p>Functional MRI has provided direct imaging of brain regions involved
in reading in normal individuals. It has provided new details about
patterns of brain areas involved in different types of readers and how
those areas differ in dyslexia. Large scale studies of young people with
attention deficits show brain regions that are focally underdeveloped
compared to controls. Developmental norms for PET, functional MRI and
standard MRI are just developing. The symposium provides direct and
empirical information about the actual (not theoretical) organization of
brain regions serving learning, language, social competence and attention
functions.

climate in which staff, students, and parents feel welcome and thrive.
Dr. Brooks will discuss a framework for understanding the components of
self-esteem and motivation, the importance of identifying and reinforcing
the "islands of competence" in ourselves, our staff, and our students,
and specific strategies for fostering self-esteem, motivation,
self-discipline, and resilience in all students, especially those with
learning disabilities. 

<hr width="75%">

<h3 align=center>Service Delivery Models:<br> There is More Than One
Way</h3>

<b>James M. Kauffman, Ph.D.</b>, Professor, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 

<p>Dr. Kauffman, author and lecturer, will discuss classroom practices
that make up the discipline of special education. This presentation

<h3>Interpreting Neuropsychological Assessments <br>
From the Perspective of Language and  Learning:<br>
An Analysis of the WISC-III and Story Memory Tests</h3>
<b>Presenter: <br>
Sandra N. Kleinman, Ed.D. 
</b>, The Howard School, Atlanta, GA 

<p>There has been an important shift from domain-specific assessments to
integrated assessment models 
reflecting the variability in language-learning profiles of children and
adolescents across tasks and social 
contexts. The presenter will analyze two neuropsychological assessment
tools - WISC-III and Story 
Memory Tests - from which information about language-learning disorders
can be gleaned.

<h3>The Effect of Word-Finding Difficulties<br>
 on Students' Cognitive Assessments</h3>

<b>Diane J. German, Ph.D. </b>, National-Louis University,
Evanston, IL
<p>An investigation that examines the potential effect of students'
word-finding difficulties on their 
intellectual assessment will be presented. A retrieval deficit rather
than a conceptual deficit hypothesis 
will be proposed as underlying lower cognitive scores earned by students
with word-finding difficulties. An 
adapted-assessment model will be recommended.

<h3>Diagnosing Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder with Adults:<br>
What뇹 Definitive and What뇹 
Plausible?</h3>
<b>Melinda Parrill, Ph.D. </b>, Child and Family Institute, Atlanta, GA 

<p>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in adults is diagnosed in
diversely different ways: a 
professional뇹 apparent snap judgment; complaints of others;
self-diagnosis; positive medication response; 
psychological testing; and integration from multiple sources. Within this
presentation cautions and 
considerations will be addressed. Case studies will be used to illustrate
the diagnostic significance of 
differential diagnosis, comorbidity, and life circumstances when making a
plausible diagnosis.

<P>Discipline should not be used as a weapon. The term is not interchangeable
with punishment. Without discipline, children would find themselves isolated
and unable to make reliable predictions about their environment. Discipline
enables children to develop autonomy as well as relationships with those
around them. The presenters will demonstrate how to establish a safe, predictable
environment that provides esteem building messages to children with behavioral
challenges. </P>

<B>Connie Parr</B>, LDA National Board Member, Oswego, IL </P>

<P>This presentation will introduce typical and atypical develop-ment of
children, ages two through six, across the domains of cognitive, language,
motor, self-help, and personal/social functioning. A growing number of
children are at-risk for developmental disabilities and in need of intervention
services due to advances in medical technology, the growing impact of poverty,
and the biological and environmental effects of substance-abusing parents.
A history of at-risk children will be presented. The steps that may be
taken to obtain the background of the at-risk child in early childhood
will be clarified. The importance of medical reports, direct observations,
developmental and behavioral rating charts, and information from the home
will be outlined. Participants will learn to identify areas of learning
disabilities and corresponding intervention strategies and activities.
Participants will learn to identify conditions which may cause the Young
Child to be 뉴t-Risk as well as ways to talk to parents about concerns.

<B>Janellen Huttenlocher, Ph.D.</B>, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL
<BR>
<B>Kelly Mix</B>, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL </P>

<P>This session will be concerned with the development of young children뇹
quantitative skills. Strong claims have been made about abstract concepts
of number that begin in infancy. Evidence from studies that are relevant
to such claims will be discussed. These studies delineate what infants
and preschoolers do and do not understand about number. These experiments
address early notions of numerosity as well as the ability to carry out
addition and subtraction operations on whole numbers and fractional amounts.
One premise of this research is that gaining a better picture of early
quantitative skills in preschool children will help educators teach the
mathematical conventions that map onto these skills. </P>

<P><B>Richard D. Lavoie</B>, M.A., M.Ed., Executive Director, Riverview
School, Cape Cod, MA </P>

<P>It has long been accepted that children with Learning Disabilities are
는nvironmentally dependent. That is, they respond directly and intensively
to the environment in which they find themselves and thus take their social/behavioral
cues from their surroundings. Therefore, the key to managing the behavior
of these children may lie in changing the environment, not the child! This
workshop will discuss and demonstrate a Behavior Management program that
enables parents and teachers to create a learning environment that provides
the structure, support and predictability that allows and encourages kids
to behave appropriately. Dozens of specific strategies will be presented.

<P>늉hat can we do to help this child grow up to be a happy, well-adjusted
person who has friends, feels successful and enjoys life? This question
is of primary concern to parents and educators raising children with learning
disabilities. The focus here is those seemingly 늘ntangible qualities
such as motivation, persistence, optimism, empathy, social skills, frustration,
tolerance, and problem solving; qualities that fall under the broad heading
of 늟ersonality. This session will focus on how these qualities can be
defined and assessed in order to guide intervention, with illustrative
material from a multidisciplinary project directed toward promoting development
of these qualities in elementary school students with severe social disabilities.

<B>Dorothy Crawford,</B> Past President, Life Development Institute, Phoenix,

<B>Joe Swalwell</B>, Director, Downtown Topeka, Topeka, KS </P>

<P>Panel of business executives will discuss three basic concerns shared
by individuals in the workforce, especially individuals with learning disabilities.
Often in the world of work we don뇺 know what we are qualified to do. In
addition, many of us do not know the realities of presenting ourselves
in a way that makes us an appealing hire. On the job adults with learning
disabilities may lose ground because they may misunderstand what is expected
of them. The combination of misperceived expectations and a variety of
other issues may cause the adult with learning disabilities to lose their
job. What do we do to place ourselves in a likely position for promotion?

<P>Collaboration between secondary education and higher education service

A self assessment, academic assessment, and finally a post secondary assessment
are essential ingredients in the Individual Transitional Plan. </P>
