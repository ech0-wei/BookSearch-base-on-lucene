HELD A WORKSHOP ON IMMIGRATION ISSUES IN GERMANY AND THE US: CHALLENGES
AND OPTIONS.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
There are perhaps 125 million immigrants, legal and illegal migrant
workers, and refugees and asylees who are outside their countries
of citizenship, meaning that about 2 percent of the world's population
are &quot;foreigners&quot; in their current countries of residence.
However, the distribution of the world's foreigners is not uniform--there
are few foreigners in the world's two largest nations--China and
India--while the foreign-born are almost 9 percent of the US population
of 265 million, and foreigners are 8 percent of Germany's 80 million.
<BR>
The circumstances over which foreigners enter and stay in industrial
democracies such as Germany and the US are a major issue at the
end of the 20th century, just as they were at the beginning. Among
the most contentious issues are asylum--how to deal with persons
who arrive in a country and ask to stay on the grounds that, if
they return to their country of citizenship, they will face political
persecution--and guest workers, foreign workers who are to live
and work only temporarily in the host country. <BR>
Dealing with asylum seekers and guest workers is difficult and
expensive because each person and job must somehow be dealt with.

<P>
<A NAME="_Toc334660639">Asylum</A> <BR>

<P>
Germany's constitution includes an individual and enforceable
right to stay in Germany while an application for asylum because
the individual would face political persecution at home is considered.
The number of asylum applications jumped in the early 1990s, peaking
at 438,000 in 1992, as migrant workers joined genuine asylum applicants
in a system that was taking 3 to 5 years to reach the decision
that 95 percent of all applicants were not entitled to asylum
in Germany.<BR>
A combination of costs, anti-foreigner violence, and the reality
that many foreigners were abusing the asylum process to immigrate
to Germany led in 1992 to a political compromise that left in
place an individual constitutional right to apply for asylum in
Germany, but added a clause that denied nationals of EU member
nations, and persons who transited through a &quot;safe third
country&quot; en route to Germany access to the constitutional
guarantee. The German Bundestag generates the list of safe third
countries.<BR>
Germany also adopted the safe country of origin concept. If an
asylum applicant is from a country that is presumed not to persecute
its citizens for political reasons, applicants from such countries
can be sent home while their applications are considered. As soon
as the German Bundestag put Poland, Hungary, and Romania on the
safe country of origin list, the number of applications from these
countries dropped sharply.<BR>
Since Germany is surrounded by EU nations and safe third countries,
the only asylum applicants after this new asylum provision went
into effect in July 1993 should have been the 6000 applicants
who applied at Germany airports. But almost 140,000 foreigners
applied for asylum in Germany in 1994, and a similar number of
applications is expected in 1995.<BR>
There are several reasons why there are still an average 350 applications
for asylum daily in Germany is that Germany must prove that the
applicant in fact transited through a safe third countries en
route to Germany. Since many applicants assert that they were
placed, e.g., in a truck and driven to Germany, and they have
no idea of which countries they transited, German authorities
must prove that they in fact transited through safe third countries.
<BR>
One court has gone much further, ruling that asylum applicants
in Germany have the right to present arguments that designated
safe countries are in fact not safe. If this interpretation of
the asylum compromise is upheld, then applicants may soon learn
that e.g., it is easy to stay in Germany while their arguments
that Poland or Greece are in fact not safe countries in which
to apply for asylum.<BR>
US refugee and asylum practices reflect cold war policies. The
1980 Refugee Act was supposed to bring the US into line with other
industrial democracies in its treatment of refugees and asylum
seekers, but experience suggests that, in fact, the US continues
to grant asylum to persons fleeing regimes that the US opposes
(Nicaragua in the 1980s), and to deny asylum to persons from friendly
nations(El Salvador).<BR>
There were about 150,000 asylum applications in 1994, one-fourth
filed by Guatemalans. In January 1995, the INS by regulation tightened
procedures to &quot;prevent abuse&quot; of the asylum system--applicants
are denied work permits for 180 days after their applications
(unless they are granted asylum), and more are detained while
their applications are considered. <BR>
The INS believes that these reforms have reduced frivolous applications,
but proposals pending in Congress would go much further. Under
one proposal, for example, applications for asylum would have
to be filed within 30 days of arriving in the US, and could not
be filed by persons that the US is seeking to deport.<BR>
In both the US and Germany, one indicator suggests that these
reforms have &quot;worked&quot;--the number of asylum applications
appears to be dropping. But the discussion that followed produced
assertions that these &quot;temporary fixes&quot; will be undone
by events, such as court interpretations in Germany that re-introduce
lengthy applications procedures. 
<P>
<A NAME="_Toc334660640">Guest Workers</A> <BR>

<P>
Germany in the 1960s initiated guest worker programs with its
southern neighbors from Turkey to Italy to Spain. Guest or foreign
worker programs aim to add workers to the labor force without
adding permanent residents to the population, but the world wide
experience with such programs has produced one of the few &quot;principles
of migration&quot; --there is nothing more permanent than temporary
foreign workers. <BR>
Between 1960 and 1973, some 18.5 million foreigners arrived in
Germany, and almost 5 million settled in Germany. This means that
most guest workers returned to their countries of origin as planned,
but employer requests to extend the stay of what were in fact
probationary immigrants, plus family unification, produced a stable
foreign population in Germany in the 1980s.<BR>
This changed in 1989. The demise of communism, and an economic
boom in Germany, led to a sharp increase in immigration. Germany
responded, in part with 5 new foreign worker programs.<BR>
There are three major differences between the guest worker programs
of the 1960s that gave Germany a peak 2.6 million foreign workers
in a labor force of 26 million in 1973 and the guest worker programs
that in 1995 may add the full time equivalent of 250,000 foreign
workers to a labor force of 40 million. First, in the 1960s, there
was a single program or procedure to bring foreign workers into
Germany, and it responded primarily to the needs of German employers--German
employers needed more workers on assembly lines and at construction
sites, and the German Employment Service helped them to find foreign
workers by establishing recruitment and screening offices from
Istanbul to Lisbon. In 1972, some 1 million guest workers entered
Germany.<BR>
In the 1990s, by contrast, there are at least 5 distinct programs
through which perhaps 300,000 legal foreign workers enter Germany
for 3 to 24 months. These programs range from a seasonal program
that permits foreign workers to be employed up to 90 days in Germany,
a project-tied program that permits e.g., a German company to
subcontract with a Czech company to complete part of a construction
program and the Czech company to send Czech workers to Germany.
There are also smaller programs under which border commuters,
trainees, and nurses enter Germany to work.<BR>
Unlike the 1960s program, which were mostly a response to domestic
labor shortages, these 1990s programs respond to two distinct
impulses. First, German employers requests for additional labor--despite
an unemployment rate of 9 percent--and second, the need of restructuring
economies in Eastern Europe to find an outlet for especially young
workers. <BR>
Foreign policy played a very significant role in the decision
to establish programs through which seasonal farm workers, construction
workers sent by their home firms to Germany, and trainees can
work in Germany. In fact, some Germans point to the real bilateral
nature of 1990s programs to explain why Poland and the Czech Republic
are willing to cooperate with Germany to reduce the movement of
illegal aliens through their countries and into Germany--Poles
and Czechs do not need visas to enter Germany.<BR>
Second, in the 1990s there are several distinct programs. In other
words, rather than trying to satisfy all of the domestic and foreign
concerns with one guest worker program, there are today separate
programs for very short labor needs, for workers sent abroad by
their home-country employers, and for trainees and border commuters.
Each program has its own rules on recruitment, labor market testing,
etc.<BR>
Third, there is not yet a consensus on whether the current German
programs will prove to be a substitute for or an addition to illegal
immigration from Eastern Europe. In the early 1990s, when over
200,000 seasonal Poles and other East Europeans worked for up
to 90 days in Germany, there was undoubtedly some substitution
of legal for otherwise illegal workers. <BR>
But it is not yet clear whether Germany's decision to permit perhaps
1 percent--(500,000) of the 50 million workers in Eastern Europe
to work legally in Germany will in the long run increase or decrease
illegal immigration. If Eastern Europe can develop quickly, offering
jobs and higher wages, supply-push emigration pressures will decrease.
<BR>
However, demand-pull pressures in Germany are likely to increase
as a result of economic integration in Western Europe and around
the world. The search for cheap labor by farmers and construction
companies is likely to persist, and it is not yet clear whether
the slowly-deregulated German labor market can continue to keep
illegal immigrants a smaller percentage of the German labor market
than they are of the US labor market. <BR>
A review of guest worker programs suggests that most were initiated
in response to macro &quot;emergency&quot; or temporary situations--
the wartime in the US, what was believed to be the end of a fragile
postwar economic recovery in Europe, and a construction boom in
the Middle East. However, today's US and German programs are responding
to micro labor market shortages, such as in agriculture and construction,
or political considerations.<BR>
Second, employers wanting guest workers usually succeed in getting
them, largely because they can point to real and measurable benefits
if foreign workers are admitted, while opponents offer hypothetical
arguments against their admission, such as wage adjustments will
eliminate the labor shortage easily. Third, guest worker programs
everywhere tend to operate close to plan in their initial stages,
tending to reinforce employers who want them and to silence critics.
<P>
<A NAME="_Toc334660641">Border Control</A> <BR>

<P>
Every day, the INS apprehends about 3500 mostly Mexican aliens
along the Mexican-US border, about 1.3 million per year. In September
1993, a local INS Commissioner introduced a new policy of deterring
illegal entry rather than apprehending illegal aliens in the US,
and in August 1994, the INS officially adopted this prevention
of illegal immigration through deterring entry strategy by massing
INS resources at the several points along the border where most
aliens attempt to enter illegally.<BR>
In October 1994, the INS launched Operation Gatekeeper along a
14 mile section of the 2000 mile border that typically accounts
for half of all apprehensions. Along the Mexican-US border south
of San Diego, a steel-plate wall, lights, and 1300 agents were
arrayed in three lines, so as to discourage attempts to enter
the US illegally. If aliens did succeed in entering, agents hoped
to apprehend them before they could slip into populated areas.
<BR>
Apprehensions dropped in the San Diego area after Gatekeeper was
launched in the fall months of 1994, but have risen sharply in
1995, and are up 10 percent in the first 10 months of FY95 versus
FY94. There were almost 50,000 apprehensions in July 1995.<BR>
A careful examination of the data indicates that apprehensions
dropped most sharply in the areas of the border where the INS
concentrated its resources, and rose sharply in other areas. In
other words, aliens now make their first attempts at illegal entry
at places further east of San Diego, or make a first attempt in
the westernmost section, and subsequent attempts elsewhere.<BR>
There are no definitive data that indicate whether the prevention
through deterrence strategy is in fact reducing overall illegal
immigration to the US. The INS is fingerprinting all of those
apprehended in the San Diego area, and finds that a steady 20
to 30 percent are recidivists, aliens who were caught before.
<BR>
Some informal surveys of aliens in the US suggest that about 70
percent of them succeed in entering the US illegally on their
first try. Surveys of aliens in Mexico find that, even though
most of those planning to enter the US illegally know about Gatekeeper,
the INS operation is not deterring them from planning to attempt
illegal entry.<BR>
This suggests that the INS can indeed shift aliens attempting
illegal entry along the border, but it is not yet clear whether
the INS can in fact significantly change the overall flow of unauthorized
aliens into the US. The INS initially asserted that the effects
of Gatekeeper would be apparent within one year, but internal
INS documents say that it will take five years to &quot;reassert
control&quot; over the border by adding fences, lighting, and
agents from west to east.<BR>
The German data, by contrast, suggest that the major new control
measure--the 1993 asylum reform--also reduced illegal entries.
There were about 35,000 illegal aliens apprehended in Germany
in the first half of 1993, and 17,000 in the first half of 1994.
However, the second half year comparison shows a smaller difference--19,000
apprehended in the last six months of 1993, and 14,000 in the
last six months of 1994--suggesting that in Germany aliens and
their smugglers may be adapting to the new law.<BR>
The papers presented at the workshop are available from the CGES.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc347218330">Minutes</A> </H2>

<P>
Rogers Brubaker (UCLA) discussed &quot;ethnic unmixing&quot; in
Eastern Europe, and emphasized that people can move across borders
(migration), and borders can move across people (various forms
of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;). One of the world's major ethnic
unmixings occurred after WWII, when 12 million Germans returned
to shrunken Germany, and Brubaker is interested in how ethnic
unmixing might occur in the former USSR, where 25 million Russians
live outside Russia, and in Eastern Europe, as e.g., will ethnic
Hungarians in Romania stay there?<BR>

<P>
There are many types of ethnic unmixing, so that the reasons for,
costs of, speed, and volume of migration varies enormously. If
an ethnic-dominated government falls violently in a multi-ethnic
society, than those ethnics most associated with the old government
are most likely to be pushed out quickly, especially if the ethnicity
that causes them problems in one country gives them a welcome
mat elsewhere.<BR>

<P>
Ethnicity can become an economically-valuable good, especially
if a rich country such as Germany offers automatic citizenship
to ethnic nationals who move &quot;home.&quot; The number of &quot;ethnic
Germans&quot; has been increasing in the ex-USSR in response to
the opportunity to emigrate to Germany. However, it was noted
that ethnic unmixing may result in a move from isolation to isolation--the
ethnic Germans in Germany may be thought of there as Russians.
<BR>

<P>
Ethnicity can also increase network access to emigration. Ethnic
Hungarians in Romania, for example, may be better able to migrate
seasonally for employment to Hungary than other Romanians.<BR>

<P>
Philip Martin (UCD) discussed the probable effects of the peso
devaluation on Mexico-to-US migration. As with many US-Mexican
relationships, there is an asymmetry in the migration relationship:
the US accepts immigrants from many nations, but virtually all
Mexican emigrants head for the US. Mexico is expected to send
over 3 million immigrants to the United States over the 15 years
between 1981 and 1995, equivalent to 20 percent of Mexico&iacute;s
net population growth, and 25 percent of legal US immigration.
<BR>

<P>
On January 1, 1994, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
went into effect, laying the basis for an eventual free trade
area encompassing 380 million people with a combined GDP of $7
trillion. The purpose of NAFTA is to reduce trade barriers and
promote investment in the region, thereby stimulating economic
and job growth throughout North America.<BR>

<P>
Mexico has had major devaluations at the end of each of the last
4 Presidencies: in 1976, in 1982, again in 1986-87, and in 1994-95.
After each de-evaluation, illegal immigration increased, but there
is no consistent relationship between economic troubles in Mexico
and illegal immigration to the US, at least as measured by apprehensions.
For example, after the 1982-83 peso devaluation, it took about
16 months for the US Border Patrol to notice a significant increase
in illegal immigration. In 1987, apprehensions dropped despite
a devaluation of the peso, largely because so many Mexicans were
becoming legalized US immigrants.<BR>

<P>
The economic background and US immigration responses to the first
two peso devaluations may provide clues about responses to the
1994-95 devaluation. The 70 percent peso devaluation of 1982-83
lowered real wages in urban areas and put Mexican farmers in a
cost-price squeeze, but the fact that Mexican workers kept their
jobs and saw their standard of living erode gradually helps to
explain the delayed illegal migration response. The 1986-87 peso
devaluation, by contrast, occurred when the US was offering an
amnesty, while the INS was educating employers rather than enforcing
sanctions, and during a period of rapid US job growth, all factors
that encouraged a seemingly &igrave;legal&icirc; migration response.
<BR>

<P>
The 50 percent peso devaluation of 1994-95 is occurring in a different
climate in Mexico and the US. In Mexico, for the first time, it
appears that there will be significant layoffs from formal sector
jobs --the Mexican government projects that 1 million workers
may be laid off from formal sector jobs, and that 400,000 were
laid off since January 1, 1995. <BR>

<P>
With more urban workers facing unemployment without a safety net,
and most of the relief programs apparently designed to help rural
people--Mexico plans to employ 500,000 workers temporarily to
build and repair rural roads- -poor farmers could be joined in
the northward trek in 1995 by unemployed factory workers. INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner, for example, noted that some of the
Mexican aliens apprehended by INS agents said they crossed the
border because of plant closings or other job losses related to
the peso devaluation.<BR>

<P>
There are three broad options to deal with the increased emigration
pressure in Mexico: develop better border and interior controls
designed to deter Mexican and all other illegal immigrants, try
to convert illegal Mexican migrants into legal guest workers,
and induce Mexico to cooperate to reduce illegal immigration.
<BR>

<P>
Jack Citrin (UCB) discussed the results of opinion polling that
found widespread sentiment for reducing immigration. Elites--better
educated and wealthier people--tend to favor current or higher
levels of immigration; mass opinion favors less immigration. 
<BR>

<P>
There was a remarkable similarity of opinion on immigration regardless
of micro economic circumstances--whether a person was employed
or not, his or her feelings about the need for less immigration
were similar. <BR>

<P>
It was noted that anti-immigrant sentiments seem to be rising
in all aging industrial societies and that, in many countries
with different groups of immigrants, one group--Turks in Germany,
Algerians in France, or Mexicans in the US--seem to typify what
those polled do not like about immigration. <BR>

<P>
Nancy Bolton (UCLA) reported on the results of an ongoing project
that is using state income tax records to study demographic change
in CA. Using returns filed in 1990 and 1993, Bolton and her colleagues
matched via SSNs a sample of persons who filed returns in both
years, and this matching suggests that migration out of CA was
much greater than previously believed--perhaps a net 400,000 residents
left CA in 1990. <BR>

<P>
Tax records overcount households because many individuals living
together file separate tax returns, but they undercount the population
because not all persons are required to file, especially the elderly
with only social security income and those on welfare. However,
there has been a significant increase in tax filings by poor people
with children to obtain the Earned Income Tax Credit--a maximum
$1300 in 1992 if no tax was owed. <BR>

<P>
One noteworthy trend was that non-Hispanics seemed to move out
of CA between 1990 and 1993, while Hispanics moved in. CA's payroll
employment in March 1995 was 12.2 million, up a net 54,000 in
the first 3 months of 1995.<BR>

<P>
Call for Proposals - Deadline, June 1, 1995<BR>

<P>
The Center for German and European Studies announces a competition
for a 
<P>
limited amount of grants of up to $2,000 available to registered
UC 
<P>
graduate students. Grant recipients would be expected to become
active 
<P>
participants in the Comparative Immigration and Integration Program,
a 
<P>
study group which meets two times a year to discuss economic,
political, 
<P>
and socio cultural questions raised by immigration into North
American 
<P>
and Western Europe, and the integration of newcomers into these

<P>
industrial democracies. Funds may be used for research related
travel, 
<P>
supplies and expense, (excluding equipment).
<P>
This Comparative Immigration and Integration Program (CIIP) is
interested 
<P>
in the issues raised by migration from developing nations into
the 
<P>
industrial nations of North America and Western Europe, the adaptation
of 
<P>
newcomers to industrial societies, and the responses of industrial

<P>
country populations to third world immigration. The purpose of
student 
<P>
research grants is to permit students with comparative migration
and 
<P>
integration interests to do further research of this type, and
to enable 
<P>
those with expertise in one area of migration or integration to
develop a 
<P>
comparative perspective in their work.<BR>

<P>
Proposals should indicate whether the questions being addressed
are 
<P>
primarily economic, political, or socio cultural. The CIIP defines
these 
<P>
categories broadly, and does not expect, e.g., only economists
to deal 
<P>
with economic questions. Sociologists and anthropologists interested
in 
<P>
the impact of immigration on native born minority workers, or
on how 
<P>
immigrants fare in ethnic enclave economies, might for example,
also be 
<P>
dealing primarily with economic questions. The CIIP recognizes
that 
<P>
Migration Studies is an inchoate field, and has adopted this three-way

<P>
economic, political, and socio-cultural taxonomy only for administrative

<P>
convenience.<BR>

<P>
Applications should consist of a short description of the proposed

<P>
research, a CV, a budget, and a statement listing the amounts
and sources 
<P>
of other funds that have been received or applied for to support
the 
<P>
proposed research. Berkeley students should submit their applications

<P>
directly to the Center for German and European Studies at the
address 
<P>
below. UC Students at campuses other than Berkeley or UCSD need
to submit 
<P>
their applications through the Contracts and Grants Office at
their home 
<P>
campus, allowing 2 weeks for processing. Please see your departmental

<P>
business officer for instructions and information. Applications
should 
<P>
be received at the following address by June 1, 1995; awards will
be announced in mid-June.<BR>

About 8 percent of the populations of Germany and of the US are
foreigners. Both countries are struggling to manage the influx
of foreigners, integrate resident foreigners, and do both in an
humane and durable fashion.<BR>

<P>
Several recent newspaper reports have suggested that the US could
derive both positive and negative lessons from recent Germany
experience in managing immigration and integration. Asylum applications
fell from 438,000 in 1992 to about 130,000 in 1994, less than
the US level. The number of foreign workers arriving under at
least 5 distinct programs aimed at ensuring that such programs
add workers to the labor force but not residents to the population
is between 200,000 and 300,000. <BR>

<P>
Germany has a more generous social welfare system than the US
and, at a time of planned US cutbacks in immigrant eligibility
for welfare benefits, a review of the eligibility of foreigners
for benefits may be useful. Finally, both Germany and the US are
struggling to ensure that resident foreigners are integrated,
so a review of German definitions of integration, and integration
policies, should be illuminating.<BR>

<P>
The purpose of this workshop is to bring together 40 to 50 Washington
area immigration policy experts to review recent immigration developments
in Germany, and their implications for the current US immigration
policy debate. The morning session will review what Germany has
done to deal with asylum flows and foreign workers. Frank Loy,
President of the German Marshall Fund, will provide a comparative
perspective on immigration and integration issues at lunch. The
afternoon session will feature presentations on the access of
foreigners to tax-supported social services in Germany, and issues
surrounding the integration of foreigners.<BR>

<P>
Attendance will be limited in order to maximize opportunities
for discussion. German speakers will make 20 minute presentations,
followed by 10 minute comments by discussants, and then 45 minutes
of roundtable discussion. The major items of discussion will be
summarized in Migration News.<BR>

IMMIGRATION AND INTEGRATION CHALLENGES IN GERMANY AND THE US<BR>

<P>
Both Germany and the US include about 8 percent foreigners in
their populations, both are worried about continuing immigration
and the integration of resident foreigners, and both are searching
for durable immigration and integration policies for the 21st
century. Despite their different histories, policies, and goals,
can the two countries learn from one another how to better manage
migration and integration?<BR>
<BR>
A March 28, 1995 conference in Washington DC on immigration and
asylum challenges and choices in Germany and the US heard that
that &igrave;non-immigrant&icirc; Germany has been affected by
5 waves of immigrants over the past 50 years. There are proportionately
far more newcomers and their descendants living in Germany today
who arrived since 1950 than in the US, which means that recent
migration may have done more to reshape today&iacute;s non-immigrant
Germany than it influenced the immigrant US. <BR>
<BR>
Neither Germany nor the US is satisfied with the immigration and
integration status quo but, in both countries, there is little
agreement on answers to the three fundamental immigration questions:
how many, from where, and in what status should newcomers arrive?
Once immigrants arrive, a second set of questions arises: what
should be done to integrate them?<BR>
<BR>
Germany and the US offer an interesting comparison. Germany proclaims
that it does not wish to become a country of immigration, but
provides a relatively generous set of services to legal foreigners.
The US, by contrast, basks in its immigrant heritage, but provides
relatively few public services to help to integrate newcomers.
<BR>
<BR>
The fact that Germany provides services but not necessarily acceptance,
while Americans accept immigrants but provide them with relatively
few services, is not the only major difference. Non-immigrant
Germany is currently one of the world&iacute;s major countries
of immigration--newcomers--including foreigners, asylum seekers,
and ethnic Germans--account for 100 percent of Germany&iacute;s
population growth. In the US, by contrast, net immigration accounts
for about one-third of population growth.<BR>
<BR>
Managing migration is a tough but not impossible challenge facing
industrial societies. As numbers rise and force action, leaders
must be willing to confront the trade-offs inherent in deciding
how to manage immigration and integration.
<P>
<A NAME="_Toc321374275">German</A> Immigration <BR>

<P>
The two parts of Germany have been affected differently by migration.
The former West Germany added 13 million net immigrants between
1950 and 1993, while the former East Germany lost 5 million residents
because emigration exceeded immigration. The former West Germany
included in 1993 about 4 in 5 Germans, and virtually all of the
7 million foreigners in Germany live in the former West Germany.
<BR>
<BR>
Germany is unlikely to remain a country in which foreigners arrive
and remain foreigners. If a net 400,000 immigrants continued to
arrive annually, Germany would in 2030 have a population of about
90 million, of whom 30 percent would be foreigners. Major cities
such as Frankfurt, Stuttgart, and Munich, which are now about
one-quarter foreigners, would have populations that were half
or more foreign. Since one in six foreigners in Germany today
was born in Germany--1.2 million of 7 million--and half have lived
in Germany for 10 or more years, the status quo of foreigners
remaining foreigners is unlikely to continue. 
<P>
<A NAME="_Toc321374276">Asylum</A> <BR>

<P>
Asylum involves foreigners arriving in a country and requesting
temporary safe haven, or the chance to resettle. In all of the
industrial democracies, the majority of asylum applications are
rejected, so that separating genuine and false asylum applicants
is a major objective of all asylum systems. However it is difficult
to construct stable systems for making difficult decisions on
who really faces persecution at home, and who is seeking economic
opportunity.<BR>
<BR>
Since there are no limits on the number of asylum applicants who
can appear and request asylum, asylum has been called the &igrave;wild
card&icirc; in immigration systems. When their numbers surge,
as they did in 1992 in Germany to about 438,000, the cost of housing,
feeding, and deciding asylum cases--some DM 6 to 8 billion or
$4 to $5 billion--can equal contributions for development assistance(Germany
provided $7 billionin ODA in 1991).<BR>
<BR>
Both Germany and the US have committed themselves to the 1951
Geneva Convention, which obliges nations not to return to danger
persons fleeing political persecution. However, each nation must
decide for itself what constitutes political persecution.<BR>
<BR>
The number of asylum applicants arriving in industrial countries
rose sharply during the early 1990s, and it was widely agreed
that many of those seeking asylum did not face an individual danger
of political persecution in their country of origin. However,
revamping systems that were designed to deal with a handful of
individuals fleeing what were widely agreed to be repressive communist
regimes, led to an ongoing debate over whether priority should
go to adding resources to the current asylum system, or whether
the access of aliens to asylum should be curtailed. Germany did
both, while the US has so far primarily dealt with asylum by adding
resources in order to speed up the processing of applications.
<BR>
<BR>
In 1992-93, there were widely reported attacks on foreigners Germany
at a time when over 1000 foreigners daily were applying for asylum.
Germany added resources to speed up the processing of asylum cases,
and streamlined the system for determining whether a foreigner
was being persecuted for political reasons in his country of citizenship,
and needed the opportunity to start over in Germany. <BR>
<BR>
The debatewas contentious in part because it highlighted disagreements
over whether Germany should become a country of immigration. The
immigration issue was not resolved explicitly, but Germany did
preserve each individual&iacute;s constitutional right to have
her asylum application considered fully, but amendments prevented
aliens who could have applied for asylum in another safe country
from applying in Germany. The burden of proof was placed on applicants
from &igrave;safe countries,&icirc; and more staff were hired
to make decisions quickly, usually within 4 weeks.<BR>
<BR>
Most observers consider the asylum reform a success. The number
of asylum applicants fell by 3/4, reducing the state and local
costs of housing and feeding asylum applicants. Romanians and
Bulgarians learned that it was not worthwhile attempting to get
to Germany and apply for asylum. There does not appear to be an
offsetting increase in illegal immigration from countries that
were sending asylum seekers. <BR>
<BR>
The US during the 1980s also received an increasing number of
applications from foreigners seeking asylum, and its system for
deciding whether to grant asylum was rightly criticized for being
too influenced by political considerations. For example, in a
Latin American civil war, if the US government was supporting
the government(El Salvador), few applicants received asylum, while
most persons were recognized if they opposed governments such
as that in Nicaragua.<BR>
<BR>
In the early 1990s, the US faced a huge backlog of asylum applications--over
400,000 in 1995, representing over 700,000 individuals. The US
does not provide welfare services to asylum applicants, but until
January 1, 1995 granted work permits to asylum seekers so that
they could support themselves while their applications were pending.
<BR>
<BR>
In January 1995, the US streamlined its system and added more
staff to speed up asylum processing, in the hopes of removing
the attraction of a work permit that seemed to be attracting some
applicants. In the US today, an applicant applies to one of what
will soon be 327 asylum officers (Germany has 900), and that asylum
officer either grants asylum or refers the case to an immigration
judge--a non-INS employee. Second, asylum applicants must now
wait at least 180 days to work legally in the US.<BR>
<BR>
Most US applicants for asylum enter the country illegally, or
enter on e.g., a tourist visa, and then wait 4 to 6 months to
apply for asylum. The INS hopes to make decisions on most applications
within 6 months, so that few applicants wind up with legal permission
to work. The US is also increasing the resources committed to
removing aliens from the country--the budget has been augmented
to permit the removal of 110,000 aliens in FY96. (In Germany,
removing aliens is the responsibility of the Land or state government).
<BR>
<BR>
Both Germany and the US have invented in-between categories for
aliens who are not eligible for asylum, but who nonetheless are
not deported. The US and German acronyms--TPS, DED, &igrave;tolerated&icirc;--reflect
the expectation that these aliens will eventually depart.<BR>
<BR>
Mass asylum in industrial democracies is a 1980s-1990s phenomenon
that has been confronted with more staff to decide cases quickly,
and by restricting access to the system. How is the asylum system
likely to evolve? Some believe that the concept of safe haven
will replace resettlement. Under some notions, ALL persons requesting
asylum would be offered safe haven, perhaps on extra-territorial
islands. Then, as budgets permit, individual cases would be heard,
and those deemed in need of resettlement would be granted the
right to begin life anew.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="_Toc321374277">Guest Workers</A> <BR>

<P>
Germany is practically synonymous with Gastarbeiter--the notion
that foreign workers can be added to the labor force without adding
long-term residents to the population. However, German and other
country experience has led to one of the few apparently universal
aphorisms in migration--there is nothing more permanent than temporary
workers.<BR>
<BR>
Germany recruited guest workers between 1961 and 1973, when their
number peaked at 2.6 million, making one in 8 workers a foreigner.
Over the next 15 years, these foreign workers united their families
in Germany, and second and third generation-foreigners joined
their parents in the German work force. <BR>
<BR>
The year 1989 ushered in a new era. The fall of the Berlin wall,
German unification, and the demise of the USSR opened heretofore
closed societies. <BR>
<BR>
Germany responded to rising immigration pressures with 5 distinct
foreign worker programs that involve some 350,000 foreigners,
and add the equivalent of about 150,000 full-time equivalent workers
to the German work force. However, unlike 1960s guest worker programs,
1990s foreign worker programs have a different purpose--to cope
with micro rather than macro labor shortages, and to make inevitable
migration legal. German foreign worker programs today also have
different incentives for the workers involved; today the emphasis
is on ensuring return to their countries of origin. <BR>
<BR>
The most important program involves project-tied workers. Under
this program, German firms sub-contract with foreign firms, and
the foreign firm supplies the expertise and workers to complete
a particular phase of a project. There were an average 40,000
project-tied foreign workers in Germany in 1994, down from 60,000
in 1992 because of scandals that involved German contractors using
project-tied agreements as a backdoor guest worker program.<BR>
<BR>
Most newly-arrived foreign workers are employed seasonally in
Germany. A peak 150,000 seasonal foreign workers in 1994 contributed
the equivalent of 40,000 FTE to the German labor force. Seasonal
foreign workers can remain 90 days in Germany, and most are employed
in agriculture, restauarnts, or construction. If the workers are
employed less than 2 months, the workers and their employers do
not have to pay social security taxes on their wages.<BR>
<BR>
The third program is for border commuters from the Czech Republic
and Poland. If local workers are not available in Germany within
50 km of these eastern borders, then employers can request permission
from the German Employment Service to employ commuter workers
at prevailing wages who can remain in Germany for up to 2 nights
weekly.<BR>
<BR>
The fourth program permits about 6000 young East Europeans to
work and learn in Germany for up to 18 months, although evaluations
indicate that Czechs, Poles, and other East Europeans learn few
skills in Germany that they use at home. Finally, about 1000 nurses
from the former Yugoslavia are allowed to work in Germany. <BR>
<BR>
In both the US and Germany, there has been a shift in the rationale
for temporary foreign worker programs. Instead of recruiting foreign
workers to deal with macro or widespread labor shortages, most
programs today are justified as a way to deal with a micro labor
shortage, or to channel into legal programs inevitable and otherwise
illegal migrants. However, most of the industrial democracies
have heeded the advice of the OECD and deregulated their labor
markets, and most today play less of a job-matching role in labor
markets--the German ES matches about 35 percent of all job seekers
and jobs, the US ES 3 to 4 percent--giving governments less credibility
when considering employer requests for foreign workers.<BR>
<BR>
Making credible determinations in micro labor markets is not the
only challenge facing governments. Governments may also have to
pay more attention to programs that admit foreigners for non-employment
reasons, but which add foreign workers to the labor force. Two
examples are foreign students(almost 500,000 in the US) and the
cultural exchange program (200,000), which adds au pair foreigners
to US households.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="_Toc321374278">Welfare</A> <BR>

<P>
Gemini has one of the industrial world&iacute;s most comprehensive
social welfare systems, and a 3-legged system of the federal,
state, and non-profit organizations, including organizations that
represent foreigners, delivers these benefits. Foreign workers
originally did not receive many benefits, but some of those who
arrived as asylum seekers, and many older unskilled foreign workers
who lost their jobs, have become long-term welfare recipients.
Just as the US welfare system has been called by some a system
for Blacks, even though Blacks are less than 40 percent of all
cash assistance recipients, so the German welfare system may wind
up losing popular support if it appears to become a system for
foreigners.<BR>
<BR>
In the US, the effort to reduce welfare has been motivated by
the search for cost savings and by the perception that minority
immigrants are getting &igrave;too many&icirc; scarce benefits,
from affirmative action to bilingual education to cash assistance.
Illegal aliens are already barred from most US cash assistance
programs except education and emergency health care, and legislation
approved in March 1995 by the US House would remove 3/4 of the
legal aliens now receiving federal cash assistance benefits from
the rolls. Currently, 2/3 of the legal immigrants on welfare,
and 3/4 of the costs, are in CA and NY.<BR>

<P>
re: October 7, 1994 Fall Workshop at UCSD<BR>

<P>
The Fall Workshop brought 30 UC faculty and graduate students
interested in Comparative Immigration and Integration issues to
the Center for US-Mexican Studies at UCSD to discuss 3 papers
and to hear a presentation on the Commission on Immigration Reform's
recommendations and research agenda. <BR>

<P>
The CIIP is funded by the CGES with funds from a 10-year grant
from the German government to promote German and European studies;
CIIP affiliates were reminded to volunteer to present their papers
at the program's Spring and Fall Workshops and to submit papers
to Martin at UCD or Patricia LaHay at CGES, 254 Moses, UCB. After
review by the CIIP Executive Committee, they will be issued as
CIIP Working Papers. <BR>

<P>
Ed Taylor (UCD) discussed a paper by Roger Waldinger (UCLA) that
asked why low-wage employers, once they begin to hire immigrant
workers, permit and encourage immigrants to &quot;take over&quot;
particular workplaces. Taylor emphasized the advantages of immigrant
networks to employers: current workers know exactly what the job
requires, current workers have an incentive to recruit only good
workers; current workers transfer existing friendships, etc into
the workplace, and networks are a cheap and efficient way to obtain
new workers. <BR>

<P>
Waldinger analyzed trends in US employment, noting that many new
jobs either require higher <B>or</B> lower skills. As the economy
evolves, the job distribution develops an hourglass shape, with
immigrants at both extremes. Waldinger focused on jobs filled
by immigrants at the bottom of this distribution.<BR>

<P>
Using employer survey data, he described how employers ask current
workers to bring friends and relatives to fill job vacancies.
When the current workforce includes immigrants who can draw from
a seemingly endless pool of friends and relatives here and abroad,
then network hiring tends to exclude e.g., native-born Blacks
and Whites, because they do not learn about job vacancies.<BR>

<P>
Why don't employers who are hiring a number of new workers try
to initiate a network of Black or white workers? Many LA employers
believe that immigrants work harder, complain less, and in general
have the &quot;right attitude&quot; toward managers while &quot;getting
along&quot; with co-workers. Interestingly, the &quot;right attitude&quot;
was considered more important for many jobs than education or
English.<BR>

<P>
Waldinger concludes that his study does not make a definitive
case for the hypothesis that immigrants adversely affect Blacks,
but it pushes him toward that conclusion. His survey supports
the hypothesis that most of the displacement due to immigration
is indirect rather than direct, a result of cumulative causation
in the labor market. Non-immigrants do not learn about many job
openings at the bottom of the labor market because the immigrant
network assures that job vacancies are filled by immigrant friends
and relatives, including those still abroad. Many do not want
to learn about these jobs, since many want more than employers
are willing to pay. <BR>

<P>
Such indirect displacement is a sharp distinction from the 1970s
view of, among others, Labor Secretary Ray Marshall, that employers
have separate queues of immigrant and Black workers. In that theory,
employers select from the immigrant line, it is argued, because
they believe that the immigrants will work &quot;hard and scared.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
The logical next step is to professionalize networks, as occurs
when labor contractors make it their full time job to recruit
a particular type of worker. This has long been the case in the
farm labor market, and is increasingly the case in the nonfarm
labor market for &quot;temps&quot; of all types. One comparative
question is the extent to which the labor market deregulation
being urged on the Europeans by the OECD will, in a time of high
migration, also promote network recruiting and labor contracting
in a manner that takes some jobs out of the public employment
system. In Germany, e.g., the public ES normally makes 30 to 40
percent of annual job placements, versus 3 to 4 percent in the
US.<BR>

<P>
The discussion emphasized that immigrants are diverse, and not
all are unskilled and entering the US job market on the bottom
rungs. Some questioned the native-born--immigrant distinction.
As to whether unskilled immigrants are &quot;necessary&quot; for
the CA economy, it was noted that many non-tradeable jobs are
becoming tradable, and that, in agriculture, there is often a
distinction between a short-run need or inelastic demand for unskilled
workers, and a much more flexible or elastic long-run demand for
labor. <BR>

<P>
Jeanette Money (UCD) linked immigration policy changes with economic
variables over the 1955-85 period in the US, UK, Sweden, France
and Germany. It is clear that total foreigner inflows varied from
year-to-year and across countries, but the data do not permit
precise counts of nor distinctions between immigrants, probationary
immigrants(European guestworkers), non immigrants, and illegal
aliens. For this reason, the US is pictured as having a generally
lower immigration rate--the annual inflow as a percent of the
population was about 2/10 of one percent in 1970, when there were
about 375,000 immigrants and the pop was 200 million--while in
Germany the rate was almost 10 times higher. The US immigrants
could stay indefinitely, but most of the German entrants were
guestworkers admitted with one year renewable work and residence
permits.<BR>

<P>
Money regressed these annual immigration flows against country-specific
economic indicators such as interest rates, manufacturing employment,
and unemployment rates, but found none of them statistically significant.
After separating out the US as a traditional country of immigration,
she concluded that &quot;nonimmigrant&quot; European nations had
higher immigration rates that immigrant US.<BR>

<P>
The paper next turns to the hypothesis that it is local reactions
to immigration policy that explain changes in it. Immigrants are
geographically concentrated. In thumbnail sketches of immigration
policy changes in UK, F, and the US, she concludes that immigration
tends to be restricted when a concentrated immigrant population
is combined with high local unemployment rates. Local opposition
to immigration in tough economic times generates pressure for
immigration restrictions, which is most likely to lead to immigration
policy changes if electoral margins are small and political competition.
<BR>

<P>
Manuel Garcia y Griego (UCI) noted that it is hard to evaluate
the relationship between immigration policy changes and immigration
flows because of the &quot;gap&quot; between immigration goals
and outcomes. Regression analysis implicitly assumes that there
is no such gap, and that there are no or uniform lags in implementing
immigration policy changes. It was also note d that, in the US,
many of the most restrictionist legislators are from districts
with few immigrants, while admissionist politicians often represent
districts with many immigrants.<BR>

<P>
Rafael Alarcon (UCB) reported on a study tracing Mexicans who
had moved from Central Mexico to several areas of CA, including
Madera. These workers originally came as solo men, but more and
more are settling with their families in CA. Philip Martin (UCD)
noted that leakage into permanence is an inevitable side effect
of temporary worker programs because of the growing mutual dependence
of employers and immigrant workers, and the complex cumulative
causation processes this dependence sets in motion. However, settlement
rates for Mexican immigrant workers in CA seem to have been lower
than were settlement rates for guestworkers in non- immigrant
Europe.<BR>

<P>
The Alarcon paper also raised other issues. Was the upward mobility
experienced by these workers, from seasonal to more permanent
worker, atypical or likely to be repeated in the 1990s and after
2000? Most European guestworkers started higher on the job ladder
than do the typical immigrants from rural Mexico--how do their
mobility patterns differ? Finally, why are naturalization rates
for these settled immigrants so low--Alarcon suggests that the
immigrants see few advantages to US citizenship, and that some
think that becoming a US citizen is being disloyal to Mexico.
<BR>

<P>
During the afternoon session of the workshop, CIR senior policy
analyst David Howell reviewed 2 major recommendations of the CIR
issued September 30, 1994, those dealing with enforcement and
benefits. The CIR's report is based on the theory that the US
must above all restore credibility of immigration policy by making
immigration easier for legal immigrations, making it harder to
illegal aliens to enter, and locating and removing persons not
authorized to be here. <BR>

<P>
CIR recommendations include support for Operation Hold the Line
in El Paso and Operation Gatekeeper, efforts to put additional
Border Patrol agents near the border to deter illegal entries
and expedite legal entries. The most visible recommendation is
to test in 5 states a registry that would combine SS and INS data.
Under the proposal, an employer would request the SSN of each
new hire after the person begins to work, check it, along with
a personal identifier such as mother's maiden name, and then record
the verification number to prove that the employer complied with
IRCA's employer sanctions provisions. If there is no match, then
the employee would continue to work while the apparent error is
investigated. The CIR recommended that more efforts be made to
educate employers to avoid discrimination, and more funds be made
available for labor law enforcement.<BR>

<P>
The CIR asserted that illegal aliens should not get any more benefits
than they are currently eligible for, primarily public education
and emergency health care. The CIR also recommended that legal
immigrants not be denied access to welfare for 3 to 5 years, as
occurs under some programs today, but that sponsors who agree
to support the family members they ask the US government to admit
should be required to honor these commitments. Further, access
to social services should be decided when new immigration categories
are created. The CIR agrees that the states which have the most
immigrants should obtain federal aid, but only for their actual
additional expenditures due to illegal immigration. <BR>

<P>
The CIR also urged that illegal aliens convicted of crimes should
be deported ASAP, and that the immigration data base be improved.
The CIR is urging that an independent critique be conducted of
existing benefits and costs of immigration, and is the lead agency
to explore ways to cooperate with Mexico to reduce emigration
push pressures. <BR>

<P>
CIIP participants expressed reservations about the registry and
the denial of benefits noting, for example, that denying benefits
may not reduce the incentive to come to the US illegally because
relatively few illegal aliens say that they come here for such
benefits. The CIR was urged to rethink the treat all countries
equally in an effort to give Mexico a larger quota.<BR>

<P>
Gustavo de la Vina and Ann Summers (INS) provided several CIIP
participants with an explanation of Operation Gatekeeper. Unlike
EL Paso, where 70 percent of the illegal entrants were destined
for the El Paso area, over 95 percent of those apprehended south
of San Diego are headed for destinations outside the area, usually
to Los Angeles, 120 miles north. This means the reaction to saturating
the border with agents is likely to be different--in El Paso,
reducing illegal entries and expediting legal entries was supported
by 90 percent of EL Paso. In San Diego, most aliens pay smugglers
$300 for the trip to Los Angeles, and many have a mindset that
they must attempt illegal entry repeatedly until they succeed.
<BR>

<P>
The goal of Operation Gatekeeper is to make it impossible for
aliens to avoid capture along a 14 mile stretch of border. There
is a fence, high intensity lights, and 3 lines of agents, all
designed to get the message out that if you attempt illegal entry,
you will be apprehended. All those apprehended are fingerprinted
electronically, and between October 1 and 6, about 6 percent of
the 6000 aliens apprehended were recidivists caught for the second
or third time. Alien smugglers have been able to evade some past
control efforts--using cellular phones to know when the Border
Patrol checkpoints on Highways 5 and 15 are down, for example,
to smuggle aliens through, and using juvenile drivers and nearly
worthless vehicles to cope with smuggling penalties and vehicle
seizure.<BR>

<P>
The Spring workshop of the CIIP will be held on a Friday in April
at UCB. We will select a date and notify you of the meeting, as
well as the 1995 CIIP RFP, at the beginning of the January or
February Migration News. Please volunteer to present a paper at
the Spring workshop, and send in your working papers.<BR>

<P>
re: April 22, 1994 Spring Workshop at UCB<BR>

<P>
The Spring Workshop brought together 16 UC faculty and graduate
students interested in Comparative Immigration and Integration
issues. CGES Director Gerald Feldman explained that the funds
that support the group are from a 10-year grant from the German
government to promote German and European studies; he stressed
the need for CIIP affiliates to acknowledge CGES in their working
papers and scholarly publications. CIIP affiliates are invited
to submit papers to Patricia LaHay, CGES, 254 Moses, UCB and,
after review by the CIIP Executive Committee, they will be issued
as CIIP Working Papers.<BR>

<P>
Dean of International Studies Dick Buxbaum noted that immigration
and integration issues provide an opportunity to do what university
leaders want to promote--interdisciplinary problem-oriented research.
Andres Jimenez of the California Policy Seminar explained that
this is exactly how the CPS is treating immigration and integration
issues in California, and that CPS may be able to provide supplemental
funds for CIIP projects.<BR>

<P>
CIIP affiliates have diverse interests. The issues being addressed
range from the apparent &quot;structural demand&quot; for immigrant
labor in industrial democracies--meaning that there is a demand
for foreign workers even during recession--to how immigrants are
being integrated in the relatively rich (parts of)countries with
nationalist movements. Several CIIP affiliates are asking how
the industrial democracies dealt with immigrants in the past,
and what lessons historical experience provide for today's debates.
<BR>

<P>
CIIP affiliates are examining the growing global importance of
the international labor market--remittances from citizens abroad
are the number one source of foreign exchange from Algeria to
the ex-Yugoslavia. Many CIIP affiliates are interested in the
transnational linkages that arise between areas of origin and
destination, and how these linkages affect the economies, politics,
and social organizations of both areas of origin and destination.
<BR>

<P>
The CIIP group agreed to hold its Fall Workshop Friday October
21, 1994. We have preliminary approval to meet at UCSD, so that
those who can arrive on Thursday October 20 can take a field trip
to the US-Mexican border. <BR>

<P>
At the Fall Workshop, the morning session will be devoted to 2
or 3 presentations by CIIP affiliates on recently-completed research
projects. A notice will be circulated in the September 1994 Migration
News asking who would like to make a 20 to 30 minute presentation
on their research; CIIP affiliates receiving support from CGES
are expected to make one presentation per year.<BR>

<P>
The afternoon session will feature a presentation on the Commission
on Immigration Reform's report, due to be released in September
1994. It is expected to guide the Clinton Administration's immigration
reform proposals.<BR>

<P>
The minutes of the Spring Workshop will be distributed by (intercampus)
mail, along with a list of the faculty and graduate students who
pariticipated in the January and April workshops, and those who
recieved CIIP research awards. Please send corrections and additions
to Patricia Lahay.<BR>

<BODY>

<P>
The CGES Research Group on Comparative Immigration and Integration
met at UCB January 14, 1994 to formulate its plans. The Group
reached consensus on three points:<BR>

<P>
1. A Steering Committee of Philip Martin(UCD), Wayne Cornelius(UCSD),
and Roger Waldinger(ULCA) will prepare a RFP and plan the April
29, 1994 meeting of the Group. Richard Buxbaum or his designee
will also be part of the Steering Committee.<BR>

<P>
2. The Group considered organizing the research activities of
participants (1) by topic(flows, short-run impacts/integration,
and long-run impacts/integration), as well as(2) by type of question
investigated(economics, politics, and integration/culture). The
group decided to organize the RFP and the April meeting by type
of question investigated.<BR>

<P>
3. The Group's RFP will be issued by early February, in the hope
that Faculty Research Awards can be made by early March. The Steering
Committee will write the RFP and screen proposals received, including
those of Committee members. Funding should be sufficient to support
all worthy Faculty proposals received.<BR>

<P>
4. The April 29, 1994 meeting of the Group will be held at UCB
in conjunction with other CGES groups. At that meeting, the expectation
is that there will be 2 or 3 presentations by Group members on
Economic questions, and 2 or 3 on Political issues. The Group
plans to hold three one-day meetings annually, with at least one
including a field trip for those who can arrive a day early.
<P>
The Group also intends to invite one or two representatives of
other institutes/commissions to act as discussants and/or to make
presentations on the structure and content of their work. Possibilities
include Mark Miller of CMS, Michael Teitelbaum/Susan Forbes Martin(US
Commission on Immigration Reform), Jeff Passel and Michael Fix
of the Urban Institute, F Heckmann and K Bade(German migration
institutes), and Roger B&ouml;hning and Jonas Widgren of the ILO
and the Intergovernmental Consortium.<BR>

<P>
5. Martin at UCD and Giselle at UCB will create an email network/bulletin
board to post news, data, and bibliographic items for the Group;
all group members are asked to post items as well. Buxbaum will
make $1500 available to Martin for the UCD part of the network;
its usefulness will be evaluated at the April meeting. <BR>

<OL>
<LI>The Group appreciates and understands Buxbaum's desire to
see the ideas and implications of the Group's research evolve
into a &quot;California perspective&quot; on immigration and integration
issues. It is hoped that the Group can evolve so that it can,
in conjunction with migration institutes in Europe and elsewhere,
secure $3 to 5 million to do comparative research on fundamental
immigration and integration issues in a manner that helps to shape
the emerging field of migration studies.<BR>

<P>

In 1996, three major laws that had their origins in the 1994 and

1995 recommendations of the Commission on Immigration Reform were

enacted that affect immigrants and immigration: The Anti-Terrorism

and Effective Death Penalty Act, signed into law on April 24,

1996, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation

Act, signed into law on August 22, 1996, and the Immigration Control

and Financial Responsibility Act, signed into law on September

30, 1996.<BR>


<P>

Susan Martin, executive director of the CIR, emphasized during

the October 4 discussion of their likely effects on the US and

CA that there is never a &quot;good time&quot; to make immigration

policy, but that 1996 was particularly difficult because of the

need to find savings in government expenditures, and American

insecurity and frustration.<BR>


<P>

The CIR's recommendations were based on two principles. First,

the US should do more to reduce illegal immigration. To accomplish

this goal, CIR recommended that the borders be &quot;managed&quot;

to prevent the entry of illegal immigrants, increasing penalties

for smuggling, and testing systems to help employers determine

quickly and reliably who is legally authorized to work in the

US. <BR>


<P>

Second, the CIR recommended that the US strike a &quot;grand bargain&quot;

on legal immigration--reduce the growth of immigration, but maintain

legal immigrants' full access to the social safety net. Specifically,

CIR recommended that the US speed up the admission of immediate

family members of immigrants living in the US, but eliminate the

right of brothers and sisters of US citizens to immigrate.<BR>


<P>

Congress adopted many of the CIR's recommendations to reduce illegal

immigration, but rejected the CIR's grand bargain proposal.

<H1><FONT SIZE=5>Illegal Immigration </FONT></H1>


<P>

The CIR urged a three prong effort to reduce and deter illegal

immigration: prevent entry over borders, prevent those inside

the US from getting jobs or benefits and, if detected, quickly

remove illegal aliens from the US.<BR>


<P>

Congress agreed to add Border Patrol agents and support personnel

to deter illegal entries over US borders, and also agreed to add

staff to expedite legal entries. However, Congress did not add

significantly to efforts to prevent illegal aliens in the US from

getting jobs: US employers may, but do not have to, participate

in experimental employee verification systems. The INS will get

1200 more inspectors, including 900 whose primary responsibility

is to deal with employer sanctions and alien smuggling.<BR>


<P>

However, at the last minute, Congress refused to authorize the

hiring of 350 more labor inspectors to the DOL.

<H1><FONT SIZE=5>Removing Aliens </FONT></H1>


<P>

The anti-terrorism bill made it easier to remove from the US aliens

who are convicted of felonies in the US. Once apprehended, criminal

aliens must be detained, and they have fewer opportunities to

appeal to stay in the US and, under the new immigration law, they

may be required to serve their sentences in their country of origin,

if the US negotiates agreements with other countries.<BR>


<P>

The immigration bill also made it easier to exclude foreigners

who enter the US without valid documents. If an unauthorized alien

applies for asylum to remain in the US, she must make a credible

claim to an INS asylum officer. If the INS officer rejects her

claim as not credible, then she has one appeal to an immigration

judge, who must make a decision within 7 days. <BR>


<P>

Unauthorized aliens in the US for seven or more years may apply

for &quot;suspension of deportation,&quot; an acknowledgment that,

over that time, the alien may have developed US roots. However,

Congress adopted a tougher standard for suspension of deportation,

and limited the number of foreigners who can obtain this relief

to 4000 per year.<BR>


<P>

The new immigration law allows the US Attorney General to deport

without any judicial review any illegal alien apprehended inside

the US, who has been in the US for less than two years.

<H1><FONT SIZE=5>Legal Immigration </FONT></H1>


<P>

According to Susan Martin, the US legal immigration system, which

manages immigration by backlogs or waiting lists, needs a major

overhaul. Over 1.1 million spouses and children of legal immigrants

living in the US are waiting--up to 10 years--to come to the US.

Many do not wait; they come illegally. Similarly, there are 1.7

million siblings, such as the adult brothers and sisters of US

citizens, in the Philippines, Mexico, and other countries waiting,

sometimes 20 to 30 years, until they receive permission to migrate

legally to the US.<BR>


<P>

The CIR recommended that the US eliminate immigration slots for

brothers and sisters of US citizens. However, an unusual alliance

between business and religious and ethnic groups prevented changes

to the legal immigration system, but not changes to the US welfare

system that make most legal immigrants ineligible for benefits.

<BR>


<P>

The CIR recommended that the US draw a firm line between the access

of legal and illegal immigrants to welfare and other public assistance

in the US. The CIR recommended that illegal immigrants receive

only emergency services, and those authorized by the US constitution,

including K-12 education for illegal alien children. <BR>


<P>

The CIR recommended that legal immigrants be eligible for the

same public assistance services as US citizens, but that sponsorship

agreements be made legally binding--if a US citizen or legal immigrant

agreed to support a relative, and that relative, after arriving

in the US, applied for welfare, the applicant would be assumed

to have access to the income and assets of the sponsor, and thus

likely not be eligible for benefits.<BR>


<P>

In order to sponsor the admission of an immigrant, a US resident

would have to earn at least 125 percent of the poverty line for

the sponsor and the immigrant(s) who would arrive, and sign an

affidavit promising to support the immigrant in the US. The US-sponsor

could have another US-cosponsor.<BR>


<P>

The welfare law makes newly-arrived legal immigrants not eligible

for most welfare benefits for at least five years after their

arrival in the US.

<H1><FONT SIZE=5>What's Next? </FONT></H1>


<P>

Susan Martin believes that immigration, which accounts for about

40 percent of US population growth, will continue to be a prominent

issue in the US and California. Four issues not addressed in 1996

are likely to get attention: legal immigration, refugees, immigrant

policy, and the administration of US immigration.<BR>


<P>

Martin believes that the US will eventually have to strike some

type of Grand Bargain of the sort recommended by the CIR because.

With legal immigration rising, and welfare services ending, poor

immigrants may become more vulnerable and visible. <BR>


<P>

Second, the end of the cold war has eliminated the major rationale

for refugee admissions over the past 50 years--providing a haven

for those fleeing communism. The US must rethink what it wants

to accomplish with refugee policy--just who among the world's

25 million refugees should US admit to start over in the US?<BR>


<P>

Third, the US has admitted about 15 million immigrants since 1980,

and many of them are not faring well in the US economy. As immigrants

and US citizens compete in a labor market crowded by ex-welfare

recipients, the US may have to consider immigrant integration

policies.<BR>


<P>

Fourth, the INS is one of the few federal agencies whose budget

has doubled in a time of reduced government spending. The US needs

to study what has become a large and expensive system for managing

immigration.<BR>


<H1><FONT SIZE=5>California Implications </FONT></H1>


<P>

Phil Romero explained why Governor Wilson in the early 1990s led

a campaign to reduce illegal immigration. The 1991-92 recession

increased the demand for state-funded services, but made it impossible

to pay for more state services. However, immigration continued

to bring large numbers of people into the state who needed state-funded

services, including unauthorized aliens.<BR>


<P>

According to Romero, Wilson thought that the federal government

should either reimburse CA for the cost of providing services

to illegal aliens, or prevent their entry. When the federal government

did neither, Wilson endorsed a state effort to reduce services

to unauthorized aliens, Proposition 187. <BR>


<P>

David Illig explained that the major assistance programs affected

by 1996 immigration and welfare legislation include AFDC, which

had about 380,000 legal immigrants on the rolls in summer 1996,

Food Stamps, with about 436,000 non-US citizen recipients, SSI,

with 331,000 immigrant recipients, and in-home supportive services,

with 55,000 non-US citizen recipients. Perhaps 500,000 non-US

citizens now receiving one or more welfare benefits may lose them

under 1996 legislation.<BR>


<P>

The major fear in CA is that, as non-US citizens are removed from

welfare rolls, state and local government may have to provide

assistance to them. Under CA law, county governments must provide

locally-paid-for General Assistance to persons not eligible for

any other benefits who need assistance, and in July 1996, about

150,000 persons in CA were receiving assistance that cost county

governments $300 to $400 million per year.<BR>


<P>

CA politicians are waiting until after the November 1996 elections

to decide how to respond to the non-eligibility of most newly-arrived

immigrants for welfare benefits, and the removal of immigrants

from the welfare rolls. Among the options are to prolong the eligibility

of current immigrant recipients--non-US citizens currently receiving

Food Stamps can continue to do so until April 1, 1996, encourage

naturalization, or simply ignore federal sanctions that are threatened

if CA does not remove immigrants as the law requires. <BR>


<P>

One proposal is to have parallel welfare programs in CA--a 100

percent federally-funded program that meets all federal criteria,

and a 100-percent state-funded program that would permit e.g.

people to draw benefits longer than five years, and perhaps serve

some immigrants.<BR>

Who's doing what? The Current Status of Research on Immigration
to CA--UCLA.
<P>
26 participants<BR>

<P>
Roger Waldinger (UCLA) noted that an analysis of Census data for
Los Angles for 1970, 1980, and 1990 emphasizes that there are
far more immigrants arriving at the bottom than at the top of
the job ladder, and that especially Mexicans at the bottom are
not enjoying rapid upward mobility. A fifteen chapter book on
Ethnic Los Angeles will be published in 1996. Waldinger, Roger
and Mehdi Bozorgmehr (Eds). 1996. Ethnic Los Angeles. New York:
Russell Sage.<BR>

<P>
Dowell Myers (USC) reported on his double cohort method--by age
and year of entry-- of analyzing what happened to immigrants arriving
in the seven southern CA counties after 1980. His analysis shows
that especially young immigrants make considerable economic progress
after their arrival--as measured by their total incomes--and that
some of their behavior converges rapidly to that of natives, e.g.,
they rapidly abandon buses and drive cars to work. In southern
CA, one-third of all bus riders are recent immigrants.<BR>

<P>
Myers noted that immigration is raising other issues, including
overcrowded housing. The US definition of acceptable housing was
two or less persons per room until 1960, when the definition was
change to one or less per room. However, as immigrants moved into
southern CA, overcrowding jumped, raising questions about how
aggressively cities should enforce housing codes developed during
a non-immigrant era.<BR>

<P>
George Vernez (Rand) outlined an ambitious project that is dealing
with the question of whether immigration is, on balance, a plus
or minus for CA by examining the effects of immigration on internal
migration, on wages, and on public sector finances since 1960.
These studies show that immigrants from most countries do catch
up to similar natives in average weekly earnings after 10 to 20
years, but not immigrants from the major country of origin--Mexico.
Furthermore, immigrant children tend to follow in their parents'
footsteps, meaning that the children of Asian immigrants tend
to do well in school, etc., while the children of Mexican immigrants
do not.<BR>

<P>
The Mexican lag may be even more severe if Mexicans tend to report
a more recent arrival date than they actually arrived. For example,
many Mexicans who may have arrived in the US before 1987 reported
in the 1990 Census that they arrived in 1987, the year that they
applied for legalization. It was also noted that, in the three
major industrial democracies of France, Germany, and the US, the
largest immigrant group--Algerians, Turks, and Mexicans--seem
to do &quot;worst&quot; on most integration measures.<BR>

<P>
Hans Johnson (CA PPI) reported that the institute has a number
of immigration projects underway, including an examination of
internal migration patterns, Mexican return migration, and the
effects of Prop 187 on prenatal care.<BR>

Mexico devalued the peso in December 1994, and 1995 was a year
of economic crisis in Mexico. More Mexicans attempted illegal
entry into the US, and the US responded with a series of border
control operations designed to prevent illegal border crossings--
Operation Gatekeeper in California, Operation Hold-the-Line in
Texas, and Operation Safeguard in Arizona. As one result, apprehensions
increased sharply in 1995-- some 1,381,465 foreigners were apprehended
by the US Border Patrol in calendar year 1995, up 43 percent from
965,144 in 1994.<BR>

<P>
Do increased apprehensions reflect the success of the Border Patrol
in apprehending a stable or declining number of aliens attempting
entry, or do they reflect more aliens attempting unauthorized
entry? Most surveys suggest that the probability of apprehension
on any attempt to enter the US without inspection is about 30
percent--in the Westat survey of 6,200 newly legalized aliens
conducted in 1989, for example, 74 percent of those in the US
illegally before January 1, 1982 reported that they had never
apprehended.<BR>

<P>
Manuel Garcia y Griego showed that the probability of successful
entry is very high for persistent aliens despite stepped up border
controls. Assuming that each entry attempt is an independent effort--meaning
that the probability of apprehension does not change from one
illegal entry attempt to the next-- if the probability of apprehension
is 30 percent on any attempted illegal entry, then 99 percent
of the aliens attempting entry will succeed after four attempted
entries.<BR>

Suppose that more Border Patrol agents, fences, and lights increase
the probability of apprehension to 70 percent on any attempted
entry. In this case, about 73 percent of the aliens who attempt
to enter will succeed after four attempts, and 78 percent after
five attempts. In other words, border control efforts work only
if they change the behavior of aliens--if those apprehended &quot;give

</TABLE>

<P>
The Border Patrol's Gatekeeper operation fingerprints and photographs
all aliens apprehended, so that apprehension data for the first
time can be used to estimate recidivism rates. Unofficial Gatekeeper
data in the winter of 1995-96 suggest that about 30 percent of
those caught once are caught again, which suggests that the probability
of successfully entering the US on any attempt may be as high
as 70 percent, especially if most aliens who are apprehended keep
on trying, as empirical studies suggest they do.<BR>

<P>
If border controls were deterring aliens, then there should be
reports of labor shortages and rising wages in the industries
that are known to employ recently arrived unauthorized immigrants.
But there are few such reports. For example, reports from the
single most labor-intensive activity in North American agriculture
in Fall 1995--the harvest of about 200,000 acres of raisin grapes
around Fresno, California from mid-August to October-- found that
newly arrived workers were getting into the US and going to work
despite Gatekeeper. <BR>

<P>
Unauthorized raisin harvesters reported in September 1995 that
some are still entering the US illegally on their first attempt.
Of those apprehended, most persisted, and succeeded after two
or three attempts. Aliens who used smugglers reported that smugglers'
fees rose from $200 to $300 in 1994 to $300 to $400 in 1995. However,
the workers major complaint was not the higher smuggling fees--it
was the fact that they lost days of work in the US because of
delays in crossing the border.<BR>

<P>
Higher smuggling fees may not be much of a deterrent because,
in most cases, the unauthorized border crossing is financed by
family members in the United States, rather than by the migrants
themselves.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc359118701">US Immigration Reforms</A> </H2>

<P>
Philip Martin summarized the status of immigration reform pending
in Congress. The House was set to take up in March a bill that
would beef-up-the-border and add new bars to access by illegal
aliens to education and welfare. The bill as approved would double
the Border Patrol from 5,000 to 10,000 agents by the year 2000,
authorize the construction of a 14-mile triple fence on the US-Mexican
border south of San Diego, and set up a five-state pilot project
that would permit employers to verify the work eligibility of
all new hires by checking a computer data base.
<P>
To cut down on the use of false documents, the bill would reduce
from 29 to six the documents that workers can present to employers
to prove their legal status, and treats document forgers as harshly
as money counterfeiters. The bill would also permit the imposition
of fines of $50 to $250 on people caught inside the US illegally,
and permits state and local law enforcement officials to detain
illegal aliens until the INS can take custody of them.
<P>
The House was also scheduled to debate a proposal by CA growers
to enact a new guest worker program. Under the Pombo proposal,
growers, labor contractors, or associations wanting to employ
foreign farm workers would have to file at least 25 days before
the job was to begin a labor condition attestation (LCA) with
their state Employment Service office listing the number of foreigners
requested and when work was to begin. Local ES offices would review
these LCAs &quot;only for completeness and obvious inaccuracies&quot;
within seven days after they are filed. Employers violating their
attestations or program rules can be assessed civil money penalties,
and be debarred from the program.
<P>
To encourage returns, 25 percent of the foreign workers' wages
would be placed into a federal trust fund managed by the INS,
which foreign workers could reclaim with interest in their country
of origin. Foreign workers would be limited to a maximum two years
in the US. Program costs would be financed by employer contributions
equivalent to Social Security and unemployment insurance taxes
that would not be paid by growers.

Internal Migration and Unauthorized Immigration, and Dealing with
Criminal Aliens--CA Research Bureau
<P>
26 participants
<H2><A NAME="_Toc359118703">Domestic and Unauthorized Migration</A>
</H2>

<P>
California in July 1995 had an estimated 32 million residents,
reflecting 569,000 births in 1994-95, 222,000 deaths, 260,000
net foreign immigrants, and a net 334,000 CA residents who moved
to other states. According to the CA Department of Finance, the
net number of CA residents moving to other states exceeded the
net number of immigrants to CA in 1992-93, 1993-94, and 1994-95.
<BR>

<P>
CA projects the population of each of the state's 58 counties
by asking counties to report any changes that are likely to significantly
affect their growth rates. The last series of projections was
done in 1993; a new series is planned for 1997.<BR>

<P>
During the 1980s, California gained a net 1.25 million residents
from the other 49 states. Between 1990 and 1995, California lost
a net 1.55 million residents to other states. CA thus experienced
a &quot;turning point&quot; in domestic migration--switching from
a net recipient of domestic migrants to a source of domestic migrants.
<BR>

<P>
Hans Johnson of the PPI examined patterns of migration to and
from CA between 1980 and 1993 and, contrary to some earlier estimates,
found that US-born residents began to move out of CA in the late
1980s, but that CA's population kept growing during this economic
boom period because of previously underestimated unauthorized
immigration--a peak 200,000 unauthorized aliens are believed to
have arrived in CA in 1989, versus the 125,000 per year estimated
by Bob Warren for the 1989-1992 period.. <BR>

<P>
Between 1985 and 1990, CA residents with lower than average levels
of education and income moved to nearby western states, while
college graduates from the east coast and midwest moved to CA.
These domestic migration patterns continued in the early 1990s.
<BR>

<P>
Johnson's research raises three issues:
<UL>
<LI>What is the best method for estimating unauthorized migration.
Johnson uses a residual technique, in which unauthorized migration
is the unexplained part of population change after births, deaths,
and net domestic and legal migration are accounted for. The most
common alternative methods for estimating illegal immigration
are apprehension methods--assuming that the number of persons
detected by the INS is a partial measure of an underlying flow.
<LI>Patterns of domestic and foreign migration change over time
in response to changing conditions in CA, other states, and other
countries. Which models provide the best estimates at inflection
points, e.g., when CA turns from being a net recipient to a net
source of domestic migrants?
<LI>WHY do US residents enter and leave CA? Are the persons at
the bottom of the education and income ladders pushed out of CA
by immigrants, as Bill Frey suggests? Does CA continue to attract
college-educated US residents because the unskilled immigrants
are complements to such labor in the CA economy, as many production
function models suggest? 
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="_Toc359118704">Dealing with Alien Offenders</A> 
</H2>

<P>
Every year, hundreds of millions of people enter the US via land
ports of entry, and the INS each year apprehends over 1.3 million
aliens at or near the border. Over 90 percent of those apprehended
near the border are Mexicans, and some who enter the US legally
and illegally are carrying drugs into the US.<BR>

<P>
The US Attorney for San Diego, Alan Bersin, was named &quot;border
czar&quot; in October 1995, and given responsibility for coordinating
US law enforcement efforts along the 2,000 mile US-Mexican border.
Bersin implemented a Deferred Prosecution Program that, under
certain circumstances, permits aliens who have been apprehended
with drugs--so-called drug mules-- to be subject to an administrative
exclusion proceeding in which green cards, border crossing cards,
and other entry documents are seized, and the alien is prohibited
from re-entering the US. 
<P>
If the alien does re-enter the US and is apprehended, then the
alien is subject to prosecution for the new offense, as well as
the original offense that led to the exclusion--the deferred prosecution.
<P>
The intent of the DPP is to preserve limited federal prosecutors'
funds for &quot;serious&quot; offenses, including prosecuting
aliens who return after being excluded in the DPP process. Experience
so far indicates that DPP is successful in deterring the re-entry
of &quot;drug mules;&quot; of those excluded, very few have been
re-apprehended in the US.
<P>
In May 1996, the DPP was criticized sharply by Republican politicians
for allegedly returning to Mexico aliens with up to 125 pounds
of marijuana; the Los Angeles Times reported that 1,000 smuggling
suspects had been returned to Mexico under DPP since 1994. Most
law enforcement officials support DPP's policy of seizing immigration
documents of first-time, small-quantity offenders, rather than
prosecute them for misdemeanors.
<P>
It is not yet clear what the long-run effects of DPP will be.
Loss of legal border crossing documents can be a serious economic
loss to a Mexican national, and immigration lawyers may point
out to those apprehended that they should take their chances with
a US jury rather than surrender their greencards etc. 
<P>
Such a tactic may doom the program's deterrent effects, since,
in most cases, the sentence for a first offense on drug smuggling
is 90 or 120 days, which is typically the time already served
by an alien held over for trial.
<P>
If this were to happen, federal prosecutors would need more resources
to deal both with aliens who elect to contest the charges against
them, and to pursue felony prosecutions of aliens who return after
being excluded in DPP proceedings.

The purpose of this conference is to explore the evidence to support
or disprove the hypothesis that:
<P>
&quot;The United States risks re-creating rural poverty through
immigration. This rural poverty may be even more difficult to
extirpate; since it requires overcoming language and education
barriers in an economy that penalizes with low earnings workers
without education and skills.&quot;<BR>

<P>
This is a working conference; we expect the 40 to 45 participants
to participate actively with researchers and local government
officials to discuss immigration and integration developments
in rural communities. A conference to discuss the policy implications
of the community studies is planned for 1997 in Washington DC.
<BR>

<P>
The presentations will each be about 20 minutes long, permitting
time for discussion. Please note that not all of the speakers
have been confirmed.

<P>
The &igrave;face&icirc; of rural America is changing, in part
because of immigration from Latin America and Asia. In many small
cities and towns in middle America, refugees arrived in the late
1970s and 1980s, and immigrants from Mexico and Central America
began arriving in ever-larger numbers in late 1980s and 1990s.
<BR>

<P>
We have held several changing face conferences in California to
<FONT COLOR=#000000>assess the prospects for integrating the immigrants
who have arrived since 1980 to fill agricultural and farm-related
jobs. Agriculture is a traditional port of entry for Mexican immigrants,
but economic and social mobility for immigrant farm workers has
in the past usually required geographic mobility--to get ahead,
many rural residents moved to cities. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
This was the first seminar outside California. One way to highlight
the midwestern experience is to emphasize the similarities and
differences between &quot;Latinization&quot; in CA and the &igrave;browning&icirc;
of the midwest. There are three major points of contrast:<BR>

<P>
1. A major magnet attracting immigrants to rural Iowa is food
processing including meatpacking, which offers year-round jobs
that pay at least $6 to $7 per hour, or $12,000 to $18,000 per
year, enough to support a family in the US. In many cases, the
immigrants moving to fill jobs in midwestern meatpacking are not
settled out migrant farm workers.<BR>

<P>
This means that there are fewer solo males, and more families,
in meatpacking towns than in the farm worker towns that surround
fields and orchards elsewhere in the US. Seasonal farm workers
earn only half as much as meat packing workers--$5000 to $7000
per year. <BR>

<P>
The presence of families raises a number of issues --housing,
schooling, health care. Unlike California, where settled Hispanic
migrants often provide many services to newcomers, and where immigrants
are often segregated in particular towns or parts of cities, immigrant
meat packing workers in the midwest often obtain public and private
services from non-Hispanic providers, making them more &quot;visible&quot;
in the communities in which they live and work.<BR>

<P>
This visibility can lead to problems, as when law enforcement
officials harass Hispanics, or lead to extra services, as when
banks and newspapers add Spanish-speaking personnel to serve new
customers. In Marshalltown, Iowa, for example, immigrant meat
packing workers can and are buying homes for $30,000 to $50,000
with the help of bank loans; few seasonal farm workers can get
loans to buy houses.<BR>

<P>
2. The Hispanics and Asians in midwestern meatpacking are not
always immigrants, and they often work alongside US-born White
and Black workers in meatpacking plants. In many workplaces, Latino
immigrants are only 20 to 50 percent of the labor force, but everyone
agrees that their presence has increased sharply over the past
10 years, and is likely to continue to increase in the 1990s.
<BR>

<P>
The fact that some of the Latino workers are US-born, and that
they often work alongside US-born White and Black workers in plants
that have unions, means that work and family integration may evolve
differently in the midwest. In California, immigrants typically
had to move to cities to enjoy upward mobility, and they were
slow to develop home-grown institutions such as the United Farm
Workers union to help them to improve wages and working conditions
in the fields. In the rural midwest, by contrast, there are non-immigrant
workers who also have a keen interest in higher meatpacking wages
and fringe benefits, making it more likely that existing unions
etc will accommodate newcomers so that they do not have to form
their own organizations.<BR>

<P>
3. Neither the industries that have and are attracting immigrants
to the rural midwest, nor the communities that often provided
subsidies to attract plants, planned for the immigration and integration
of the minority and immigrant workers that they in some cases
recruited to fill jobs. Indeed, some argue that programs that
give employers wage subsidies for some workers during their first
six months of employment, plus the meatpacking industry&iacute;s
policy of not offering fringe benefits to workers for the first
six months, encourages worker turnover in a manner that minimizes
labor costs and maximizes migration in a labor-intensive industry.
<BR>

<P>
Meatpacking may turn out to be a mobile industry that moves into
rural areas, changes the size and composition of the population
in 25 to 50 midwestern towns, and then, in some cases, moves on,
with perhaps pork moving to North Carolina, and beef to Mexico.
In some cases, the plants were attracted to the rural midwest
with the help of subsidies, rather than paying the impact fees
that might be expected to be imposed on industries that generate
such externalities.<BR>

<H1><A NAME="_Toc362587761"><FONT SIZE=4>Immigration Patterns
and Integration Policies</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4> </FONT></H1>

<P>
The number of newly--arrived immigrants who have low levels of
education, little or no English, and low US earnings is increasing,
while federal support for poor people, and especially poor immigrants,
is decreasing. This disjuncture between immigration flows and
what is often termed &igrave;immigrant policy,&icirc; in light
of pending proposals to further reduce the access of immigrants
to federal means-tested programs, raises questions about how well
immigrants and perhaps their children will be integrated throughout
the US.<BR>

<P>
Immigrants in the US are concentrated--over half live in particular
sections or neighborhoods of six cities in six states. This concentration
magnifies the effects of immigration. About eight percent of the
US population is foreign-born, but 95 percent of all US residents
live in places that have less than eight percent foreign-born
residents.<BR>

<P>
Until the 1980s, immigrants roughly replicated the US-born population
in the single-best predictor of earnings--years of education.
Immigrants arriving since the 1980s, however, have a different
distribution of years of schooling. When arrayed by years of education,
immigrants are concentrated at the extremes of the distribution.
In this way, immigration joins globalization and technological
change as a factor that is adding people to the top and bottom
of the income distribution, not the middle class. <BR>

<P>
The ten midwestern states had about 2.1 million foreign-born residents
in the 1990 Census, including about 800,000 in the Chicago metro
area. About three-fourths of the 156,000 Mexican immigrants who
arrived in the midwestern US in the 1980s moved to Chicago. Chicago
is to the midwest in immigration matters what Los Angeles is to
CA--the home of most of the midwest&iacute;s Hispanics and immigrants.
Minnesota had 113,000 foreign-born residents in 1990, Kansas 63,000,
Iowa 43,000, and Nebraska 28,000.<BR>

<P>
As in the rest of the US, most immigrants to the midwest go to
cities--about 93 percent of the foreign-born residents in the
US, but only 76 percent of all US residents, live in urban areas.
Welfare rates are low in the rural midwestern states, and foreign-born
residents are not disproportionate users of welfare.<BR>

<P>
There were are about 2 million Hispanics in the ten midwestern
states, but many are US citizens who are moving to Iowa and Nebraska
from border states such as Texas and California. Not all of these
internal US migrants speak English, so there is a tendency to
assume that all Hispanics are immigrants, and thus exaggerate
the number of immigrants in some towns. <BR>

<P>
Illinois has about half of the Hispanics in the midwest, and most
live in the Chicago area. Kansas had the most Hispanic residents
of the meat packing states in 1992--about 100,000, followed by
Minnesota with 62,000, Nebraska 42,000, and Iowa 37,000<BR>

<H1><A NAME="_Toc362587762"><FONT SIZE=4>Meatpacking</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>
</FONT></H1>

<P>
The US meatpacking industry has experienced four major changes
since World War II. First, there has been a change in dietary
habits--the average per capita consumption of chicken increased
to 70 pounds per person per year in 1995, while that of beef and
pork fell to 67 and 52 pounds per person. <BR>

<P>
Second, there have been technological changes that permitted meat
packing to move from urban consumers of meat toward farmer producers
of cattle and hogs. Boxed beef, vacuum packing, and lower wages
in rural areas were among the reasons why it became preferable
to prepare retail packages of meat close to where animals are
slaughtered. <BR>

<P>
Third, there were important changes in the labor force, especially
after 1980, that led to more unskilled workers, women, and immigrants
in the plants--women traditionally have played a more important
role in poultry processing than meatpacking. Meatpacking has always
been an industry in the US that offered relatively high wages
to unskilled and non-English speaking workers, but employers in
the past may have had more incentives to develop and retain a
skilled meatpacking work force that lived in the town where the
plant was located. <BR>

<P>
Unions represented most meatpacking workers, and they had a master
agreement between 1950 and 1979 that &quot;took wages out of competition&quot;
by requiring relatively uniform wages and benefits throughout
the industry. The real hourly earnings of meatpacking workers
peaked in 1979, when meatpacking workers earned almost $15 per
hour in 1992 dollars, and almost 20 percent more than the average
manufacturing worker; in 1994, by contrast, real earnings were
less than $10 per hour.<BR>

<P>
Meatpacking earnings fell as unions and master agreements faded,
and as skill levels fell due to more automation and technological
changes. These changes may have made worker turnover less costly
to employers, and turnover may also have been encouraged by two-tier
wage systems that developed in the early 1980s and offered lower
wages and fewer fringe benefits to newly-hired workers.<BR>

<P>
Fourth, both the raising and slaughter of animals became concentrated
in fewer and larger operations. In some cases, meatpacking plants
were located next to huge feedlots that were owned by the major
packers. The cost of the animal remains the largest single part
of the cost of meatpacking--cows cost slaugherhouses $0.60 to
$0.70 per pound, and hogs $0.40 to $0.50 per pound, and &quot;disassembling&quot;
these animals into meat products costs $0.05 to $0.10 per pound
for beef, and $0.20 to $0.25 per pound for pork.<BR>

<P>
In 1990, Iowa had a labor force of 1.3 million, including 12,200
Hispanics and 10,100 Asians. Most Hispanics and Asians in Iowa
were <B>not </B>employed in meatpacking--there were about 41,000
persons employed in food manufacturing in Iowa in 1990, including
2000 Hispanics and 1000 Asians. About 25,000 Iowa workers were
employed in meat and poultry processing.<BR>

<P>
The 11 pork processing plants in Iowa--IBP operates 5 of them--
in 1996 paid $6 to $7 per hour to entry-level workers. Most pork
processors restrict benefits such as health insurance to workers
employed for at least six months. Most plants are hiring workers
constantly to fill job vacancies --it is not unusual to issue
200 W-2 statements at the end of the year to keep 100 jobs filled.
<BR>

<P>
In plants visited by seminar participants, five month old hogs
weighing 250 pounds each were &igrave;disassembled&icirc; at the
rate of about 1200 per hour, or 16,000 to 18,000 per day on two
eight hour shifts. The hogs are stunned, hung by one leg, stuck
with a knife, and then carried through washing and singing machines
to remove hair. Carcasses are then split, internal organs removed,
and then various cuts of meat are removed as the carcass travels
past workers armed with knives. <BR>

<P>
Meat is packed in vacuum bags, large paperboard bins, or other
means for transit, and then chilled before being sent in refrigerated
trucks to retail outlets--vacuum packing meat increases its shelf
life from 3 days to 3 weeks. Some meat processors specialize in
curing hams and preparing sausages.<BR>

<P>
Within the industry, meatpacking is sometimes known as a &igrave;kill
and chill&icirc; industry.<BR>

<P>
About one production worker is required for each 10 hogs slaughtered
on a daily basis, so a plant that slaughters 16,000 to 18,000
hogs daily has 1600 to 1800 production workers. Most of them wield
one of a variety of knives, and most workers have jobs that require
them to make a particular cut as a carcass moves by at the rate
of about one every three seconds.<BR>

<P>
The job hierarchy in most plants is relatively flat, meaning that
there are relatively few production jobs that pay twice the entry-level
wage. This is one reason why especially young men may be prone
to quit one plant for another in order to have an extended vacation,
to get away from a particular supervisor, or to find better housing,
thus contributing to high worker turnover.<BR>

<P>
Most rural areas in the midwest have unemployment rates under
four percent, so meatpacking plants advertise in local media,
some offer bounties of e.g., $200 for each new worker referred,
and some have recruiters who recruit locally, and persons who
travel to e.g., TX or CA, to seek workers. In many cases, the
workers who arrive to go to work are &quot;vulnerable workers&quot;
in midwestern towns.<BR>

<H1><A NAME="_Toc362587763"><FONT SIZE=4>Community Impacts</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>
</FONT></H1>

<P>
Iowa&iacute;s manufacturing sector was restructured in the 1970s
and 1980s. Many old-line companies that offered &igrave;blue collar
elite&icirc; jobs were sold or restructured, and local mainstays
of the community were often replaced on the shop floor by &igrave;vulnerable&icirc;
workers paid lower wages and sometimes recruited from outside
the community. As one result, the &igrave;local&icirc; factory
became something more alien or foreign in many communities--no
longer a place where son followed father through the plant gates.
<BR>

<P>
The Iowa state government and local communities have struggled
with economic restructuring and the changing work force since
the 1980s. On the one hand, many companies were persuaded to stay
in or move to Iowa with tax breaks and other subsidies. However,
when it became clear that many of the workers brought to Iowa
to staff the plants were non-English speaking immigrants, Iowa
sought to prevent at least the worst abuses associated with the
recruitment of non-English speaking out-of-state workers by requiring
employers to pay their return transportation if they quit soon
after arrival under some circumstances.<BR>

<P>
In many Iowa communities, the arrival of immigrants and US-born
Hispanics beginning the 1970s followed a three-step process that
limited the ability of state and local governments to regulate
newly-restructured industries such as meatpacking. First came
solo men, including those who were recruited by employers in border
regions or in Mexico. Then came families, either Asian refugee
families who had settled in the midwest, or the families of the
solo male Hispanics who learned that they could afford to bring
their families to rural Iowa because wages were relatively high,
and housing and other living costs were relatively low.<BR>

<P>
The third step was unauthorized immigrants, including friends
and relatives of earlier settlers, who used social networks to
get jobs with employers willing to hire immigrants with no English
and little education. However, the arrival of more Hispanics,
and more unauthorized immigrants, made many local residents wrongly
believe that most Hispanic residents were recently-arrived illegal
workers. In some cases, local law enforcement officers acted on
this belief, and perhaps unlawfully detained or harassed Hispanics.
<BR>

<P>
From the point of view of CA researchers familiar with seasonal
farm workers, the striking difference between meatpacking and
CA agriculture is that meatpacking offers year-round jobs and
annual earnings that are high enough to support a family, so that
the issues associated with the arrival of families--such as housing,
schooling, health care-- become important community issues early
in the migration process. In most cases, meatpackers, like farm
employers in CA, are interested more in getting workers on the
line than they are in ensuring that there is housing in the area
for new arrivals, schools for their children, or bilingual police
and other service personnel to deal with the newcomers.<BR>

<P>
A few profiles illustrated these differences. Storm Lake is a
city of 8800 in 1990, and is home to two meat-processing plants
that employ almost 2000 workers.<BR>

<P>
Storm Lake had three major waves of immigrants over the past 15
years to the IBP plant there--two types of Lao immigrants, Mexican
Mennonites, and other Mexican immigrants. The Lao immigrants were
recruited via private networks, and the Mexican Mennonites and
the other Mexican immigrants were recruited with the active support
of IBP.<BR>

<P>
The local community is divided over the influx of immigrants.
About 24 percent of the children in K-12 classes are minorities,
and the school system says that it must spend money on English
as a Second Language and bilingual teachers, perhaps reducing
services to local children. Pork processor IBP counters that it
has a $36 million annual payroll in the area, and that schools
might close if the plant closed.
<P>
Garden City, Kansas underwent similar demographic changes that
were traced to meatpacking operations. The opening of one of the
world's largest meat packing operations was associated first with
the secondary migration of Southeast Asians into the area, and
later Mexican immigrants. Some of the meat packing workers lived
in mobile home parks that were expanded to accommodate them.
<P>
Utah provides some of the most striking examples of demographic
and economic change. On the one hand, Utah has relatively rapid
population growth, and the Mormon church is expanding fastest
in Latin America, so that there may be more receptivity to hard
working Mexican immigrants in Utah than in many other states.
However, even in Utah, there are questions raised by the arrival
of Limited English Proficient children in schools etc.
<P>
The operation/expansion of meatpacking in rural communities seem
to generate externalities that were not planned for, and are now
the subject of contention. Among the options that might be considered
are local impact fees, such as those that CA developers must pay
on new housing developments.<BR>

<H1><A NAME="_Toc362587764"><FONT SIZE=4>Next Steps</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>
</FONT></H1>

<P>
The &quot;Changing Face&quot; title of this project is meant to
suggest that the demographics of rural America are changing rapidly,
as Mexican, Central American, and Asian immigrants take jobs in
agriculture and agriculture-related industries. The federal government
spends over $600 million annually on farm worker services, and
additional funds on rural development, but many of these programs
remain rooted in the 1960s philosophy that the best solution for
rural poverty is rural-urban migration.<BR>

<P>
This project will be extended in two directions. First, we will
examine the policy recommendations outlined above in more depth
with federal and state policy makers, with planned conferences
in the Spring of 1997 in Sacramento, and in the Spring of 1998
in Washington DC. These conferences will address issues such as:
How much awareness is there of the speed with which the demographics
of rural America are changing? To what extent have policymakers
thought about the need to revamp programs begun in the 1960s to
help persons trapped in agriculture to deal with the integration
of immigrants in the US?<BR>

<P>
Second, we plan to hold conferences in other areas of the US in
which it appears that the composition of the farm and &quot;near
farm&quot; labor forces began to change very rapidly in the 1980s.
We plan to hold a conference/field trip in North Carolina in the
Fall of 1997 that focuses especially on Black-Hispanic interactions
in the labor force.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Conference Questions and Guidelines<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
This is a working conference; we expect the 45 participants to
participate actively with researchers and local government officials
to discuss developments in these communities and what might be
done. A conference to discuss the policy implications of the rural
community studies presented at this conference is planned for
1997 in Washington DC.<BR>

<P>
<B>Community Studies Discussion Questions</B>
<P>
1. What are the major issues--pluses and minuses--associated with
high rates of immigration--adding one percent or more to the population
every year via immigration, or doubling the population of the
community when seasonal workers arrive? How would these issues
be affected if the inflow of new immigrants were stopped or significantly
reduced into your community, the aim of current border control
efforts and immigration reform legislation?<BR>

<P>
2. There is no generally accepted definition of immigrant integration.
However, when two or more distinct groups share a geographic area,
two extremes delineate their possible interaction--<B>integration
or assimilation</B> means eliminating boundaries between groups,
encouraging convergence in language, values, earnings etc. <B>Pluralism
or multiculturalism</B>, on the other hand, means encouraging
the maintenance of cultural diversity, and tolerating or welcoming
ethnic enclaves. These are sometimes referred to as the melting
pot versus the salad bowl approaches to accommodating immigrants.
<BR>

<P>
Which type of integration is occurring in your community/region?
Why? What are the major factors affecting integration in this
community/region, e.g., jobs, housing, schooling, governance?
What public policies are most important in regulating the speed
and extent of integration in your community/region, e.g., housing
for families, jobs for adults, or education for children?<BR>

<P>
3. Many newly-arrived immigrants find jobs with the help of ethnic
networks. Do immigrant networks in rural communities confine immigrants
to low-wage jobs, or give them a hand up the job ladder? Some
have speculated that rural communities are distinguished from
immigrant cities such as Los Angeles--where immigrants are concentrated
at the top and the bottom of the skill and earnings distribution--because,
in rural areas, the top or the role models are missing--there
is a pyramid-shaped distribution of skills and earnings, i.e.,
a wide base of low-skill people and jobs that tapers off abruptly.
Is this true in your community/region?<BR>

<P>
4. Federal and state governments are considering decentralization
and block grants--giving less assistance to communities, but allowing
local leaders to decide how to spend assistance funds. How would
decentralization and block grants--plus new restrictions on the
eligibility of legal and unauthorized immigrants for public benefits--affect
immigration patterns in your community/region?<BR>

<P>
<B>Policy Implications</B>
<P>
1. Are there any particular communities/regions or public or private
policies that stand out in promoting successful integration, or
in impeding immigrant integration? What are the communities that
currently have a majority of foreign-born residents, and continue
to grow by one to five percent per year via immigration, likely
to look like in 10 years if current trends continue, i.e., are
current immigration patterns sustainable?<BR>

<P>
2. What seems to be the most variable affecting the success of
integration--number of immigrants, characteristics of migrants,
situation and attitudes of the community in which they settle,
or some combination of these? What does this variable suggest
about prioritizing government efforts to accelerate integration
in immigrant communities in agricultural areas--should housing,
jobs, education, crime etc.-- be tackled first, and why? <BR>

<P>
3. Federal and state governments are considering decentralization
and block grants--giving less assistance to communities, but allowing
local leaders to decide how to spend assistance funds. How would
decentralization and block grants--plus new restrictions on the
eligibility of legal and unauthorized immigrants for public benefits--affect
immigration patterns in your community/region?<BR>

The purpose of this conference is to explore the evidence to support
or disprove the hypothesis that: &quot;The United States risks
re-creating rural poverty through immigration. This rural poverty
may be even more difficult to extirpate; since it requires overcoming
language and education barriers in an economy that penalizes with
low earnings workers without education and skills.&quot;

<P>
This conference was motivated by three &quot;facts:&quot;<BR>

<OL>
<LI>The populations of many cities and towns in agricultural areas
of CA are increasing, often by 3 to 5 percent per year, versus
1 percent per year for the US as a whole, and this rural population
growth is driven largely by youthful immigrants and their children.

</OL>

<OL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>2.     </FONT>There is almost a 1 to 1 relationship
between the number of immigrants arriving in rural areas and the
number of poor adults with few years of education. There are more
uncertain and lagged effects of population growth near major centers
of labor-intensive crop production and growth in the number of
children in K-12 education, the number of persons on AFDC and
other welfare programs, and the number of persons in criminal
justice and other systems. 
</OL>

<P>
Some data suggest that growth in the number of poor immigrants
in rural California is NOT associated with indicators of welfare
use, both because unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for
such assistance and because many are in intact families that are
hoping to succeed in the US through hard work. Other data suggest
that many immigrants seek public assistance for their eligible
US-born children and themselves, and that social service usage
can be expected to increase in an S-curve fashion as settled immigrants
develop networks that take them from low-wage and seasonal US
jobs to the social service system.<BR>

<P>
3. There is agreement that the rural poverty of the 1990s in rural
California is DIFFERENT from the rural poverty of the south and
the midwest in the 1940s and 1950s that shaped social scientists
perceptions of rural poverty, and federal government solutions
for rural poverty. The conventional wisdom in the 1960s concluded
that the best way to eliminate lower-than-average rural wages
and incomes was by helping farmers and farm workers to move to
urban jobs. Moving excess human resources out of agriculture,
it was hoped, would set in motion a series of adjustments that
would ultimately improve the economic status of those who moved
and those who remained behind.<BR>

<P>
There is widespread agreement that an &quot;encourage movement
to urban areas&quot; policy will not &quot;cure&quot; rural OR
urban poverty in the 1990s. First, the number of rural poor in
rural CA seems to increase in lockstep with job opportunities
there--despite stepped-up border controls, migrants continue to
arrive to fill jobs vacated by settled persons who abandon seasonal
farm work, and new jobs created in an expanding labor-intensive
agriculture. <BR>

<P>
Second, urban areas such as Los Angeles do not offer the blue-collar
manufacturing jobs that permitted 1950s rural-to-urban migrants
to use unions and prosperity to achieve upward mobility. Unlike
the 1950s, there is today a significant immigration from abroad
directly into urban areas such as Los Angeles, and there are fewer
blue collar jobs that can deliver upward mobility to immigrant
adults with typically less than six years of schooling.<BR>

<P>
This suggests that, while the 1960s promised &quot;virtuous circle&quot;
types of adjustments--federal assistance programs reinforced economic
factors to promote migration and upward mobility in both rural
and urban areas--in the 1990s, &quot;vicious circles&quot; may
be created, in which adults &quot;used up&quot; in the seasonal
farm labor market after 10 to 15 years find few alternatives in
rural areas other than providing services to new arrivals, and
their children educated in often weak rural school systems reject
the seasonal farm jobs of their parents, but do not have the skills
needed to succeed in local or distant nonfarm labor markets.<BR>

<H1><A NAME="_Toc355930035"><FONT SIZE=4>Policy Recommendations</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>
</FONT></H1>

<P>
The roots of the rural poverty being created near centers of agricultural
production in California lie in the US and Mexico. In the US,
an ever-increasing wedge has been established between seasonal
farm workers and those who benefit from their services--in many
cases, the multi-tiered production system involves packer-shippers,
who buy from operators, who in turn lease land from owners, and
who rely on custom-harvesters and farm labor contractors to recruit
and manage seasonal workers. It is difficult to regulate this
layered production system, and very difficult for farm worker
organizations to effectuate lasting changes that would improve
their conditions.<BR>

<P>
In Mexico, there are millions of farmers and farm workers with
very low incomes, and little hope of achieving even the $3000
per person per year average Mexican income by staying in the place
where they now live. Thus, migration is an integral part of the
income-earning strategies of many rural Mexican residents, both
temporarily and permanently, and within Mexico and to the US.
However, there is general agreement that events in Mexico in the
1990s are encouraging especially young Mexicans to &quot;go north&quot;
for opportunity, either in the expanding factories in border areas,
or in the US.<BR>

<P>
Opportunity in rural America at a time when Mexico is poised to
undergo its &quot;Great Migration&quot; promise a continued influx
of newcomers to the towns and cities surrounding California's
ag production centers. There are four possible policy responses--at
the border, in US fields, in US towns and cities, or in rural
Mexico.<BR>

<P>
1. Reduce especially unauthorized entries at the border. This
is the strategy of the Clinton Administration, reflected in the
build-up of the border patrol and new fencing and lighting. Apprehensions
are up sharply in 1996, and so are smuggling fees, but it does
not appear that enough migrants are being stopped at the border
to put upward pressure on wages or working conditions in California
agriculture. <BR>

<P>
Indeed, there is pessimism that unauthorized immigration can be
slowed unless a far more effective employment verification system
is developed, something that Congress seems reluctant to embrace.
This leaves enforcement efforts concentrated on one of the three
major actors in unauthorized immigration--the smugglers who actually
help migrants to evade border controls. Unless and until enforcement
becomes effective against US employers, or unauthorized migrants,
unauthorized migration is likely to continue.<BR>

<P>
2. Make US farmers responsible for more of the costs associated
with seasonal farm work. It was noted that the divorce of many
farmers from their seasonal farm workers has reduced farm worker
take-home pay. Most farmers no longer house seasonal farm workers,
so that many workers pay $30 to $40 per week for housing in the
back yards of rural colonias, and then pay $4 to $6 daily for
rides to the fields. In addition, many workers must pay to have
checks cashed, and they face above-average prices for meals and
food in the businesses that cater to them.<BR>

<P>
There are exemplary public and non-profit housing and service
facilities in some rural towns, but there construction and operation
requires huge public subsidies, and they serve only a small fraction
of the farm worker population. These housing projects, clinics,
and day care centers appear to be islands of normalcy in seas
of poverty.<BR>

<P>
The &quot;divorce&quot; of farm operators and packer-shippers
from the seasonal farm labor force means that the farm workers
not lucky enough to get into public facilities typically spend
25 to 35 percent of their wages on services that were in the past
provided by the grower. There are several ways to re-establish
the link between workers and the beneficiaries of their labor--require
farm employers to provide or pay for housing, levy fees on commodities
for public housing, much as fees are levied for research and promotion,
or raise wages enough so that seasonal workers can afford to obtain
adequate housing with out subsidies.<BR>

<P>
Each of these responses would likely raise farm labor costs, but
there is not a one-to-one relationship between rising farm wages
and consumer prices. The US Consumer Expenditure Survey reports
that average consumer unit in 1993 spent $30,700, including $4400
on food (14 percent), $2700 on food eaten at home (9 percent),
and $270 on fresh fruits and vegetables eaten at home (less than
one percent). Farmers receive about one-third or $90 of the $270
spent on fresh fruits and vegetables, and labor costs are typically
one-third of farmers' costs, or about $30 or one-tenth of one
percent of average expenditures.<BR>

<P>
If farm labor costs were to double, and if all of the increased
labor costs were passed through to consumers, and there were no
adjustments such as increased imports or consumers shifting to
other commodities, then $60 in farm labor costs might raise the
$270 spent on fresh fruits and vegetables to $300--$60 in farm
labor costs would be about one-tenth as much as the average consumer
unit spent on maintenance and insurance on their house in 1993,
or one-tenth of what they spent on telephone service, or one-tenth
as much as the women and girls in the house spent on apparel.
<BR>

<P>
3. It may not be easy to change a farm production and labor market
system that has been shaped by immigration over the past century.
If unauthorized border crossings continue, and newly-arrived rural
Mexicans continue to find jobs in seasonal US agriculture, then
possible solutions to the &quot;new&quot; rural poverty associated
with the transfer of rural Mexicans to rural America may be found
in either in rural or urban America, or rural or urban Mexico.
<BR>

<P>
In rural America, a farm worker service economy has developed
in many areas-- the &quot;best jobs&quot; involve providing public
and private services to newcomers who need them. In a farm worker
town of 20,000, growing by 5 percent or 1000 per year, there may
be 5000 K-12 students to be taught, making the education system
the largest employer in many places, and generating &quot;good
jobs.&quot; Federal, state, and local jobs are also prized, as
our clinic and similar jobs.<BR>

<P>
The private farm worker service economy is driven by the needs
of often single male farm workers for housing, meals, transportation,
and other services. Those who study the farm worker service economy
have policy recommendations that can be framed by two extremes--don't
worry too much, because those being &quot;exploited&quot; by high
prices etc. are volunteers who took risks to cross the border
to escape even worse conditions, versus do worry--step up enforcement
of housing and other laws--because what the US and California
has established as minimum levels of decency are being violated
every day.<BR>

<P>
Young people wanting to escape from their parents as well as limited
opportunities in their communities have always been prone to migrate
toward &quot;bright lights.&quot; In the past, many youth raised
in rural towns migrated to cities such as Los Angeles. What awaits
them in LA? Census data suggest that Mexicans and Central Americans
are most likely to be trapped in the parts of the Los Angeles
labor market that is least likely to offer upward mobility. This
sets the stage for frustration rather than opportunity.<BR>

<P>
4. What about reducing the supply of immigrants that is changing
the face of rural California and rural America at its source,
in rural Mexico. Although not the subject of a great deal of discussion,
the facts offer little hope. There are 25 to 30 million people
in rural Mexico, and most are farm families that earn less than
one-third of Mexico's average income of $3000 per person per year.
<BR>

<P>
Most projections are that the farm population will be reduced
by about one million per year, the same rate of out migration
from agriculture that the US experienced in the 1950s. This shift
out of Mexican agriculture could be accommodated in Mexico, either
in rural areas with job creation, or in urban areas.<BR>

<P>
However, there is little prospect of rural job creation on the
scale necessary to make migration from rural towns unnecessary.
And once migration is necessary, then it is clear that established
networks are as likely to move rural Mexicans to rural America
as they are within Mexico, since they often have more relatives
and better job contacts in the US than elsewhere in Mexico.<BR>

<H1><A NAME="_Toc355930036"><FONT SIZE=4>Next Steps</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>
</FONT></H1>

<P>
The &quot;Changing Face&quot; title of this project is meant to
suggest that the demographics of rural America are changing rapidly,
as e Mexican, Central American, and Asian immigrants take jobs
in agriculture and agriculture related industries. The federal
government spends over $600 million annually on farm worker services,
and additional funds on rural development, but many of these programs
remain rooted in the 1960s philosophy that the solution for rural
poverty is rural-urban migration.<BR>

<P>
This project will be extended in two directions. First, we will
examine the policy recommendations outlined above in more depth
with federal policy makers. How much awareness is there of the
speed with which the demographics of rural America are changing?
To what extent have they thought about the need to revamp programs
begun in the 1960s to help persons trapped in agriculture to deal
with the integration of immigrants in the US?<BR>

<P>
Second, we intend to hold conferences in other areas of the US,
in which it appears that the composition of the farm and &quot;near
farm&quot; labor forces began to change very rapidly in the 1980s,
toward Hispanics and Asians in the midwest, and toward Hispanics
and Caribbean immigrants in the southeast and northeast. To what
extent are the patterns observed in CA also observed in these
other areas?<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Conference Questions and Guidelines<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
This is a working conference; we expect the 45 participants to
participate actively with researchers and local government officials
to discuss developments in these communities and what might be
done. A conference to discuss the policy implications of the rural
community studies presented at this conference is planned for
1997 in Washington DC.<BR>

<P>
<B>Community Studies Discussion Questions</B>
<P>
1. What are the major issues--pluses and minuses--associated with
high rates of immigration--adding one percent or more to the population
every year via immigration, or doubling the population of the
community when seasonal workers arrive? How would these issues
be affected if the inflow of new immigrants were stopped or significantly
reduced into your community, the aim of current border control
efforts and immigration reform legislation?<BR>

<P>
2. There is no generally accepted definition of immigrant integration.
However, when two or more distinct groups share a geographic area,
two extremes delineate their possible interaction--<B>integration
or assimilation</B> means eliminating boundaries between groups,
encouraging convergence in language, values, earnings etc. <B>Pluralism
or multiculturalism</B>, on the other hand, means encouraging
the maintenance of cultural diversity, and tolerating or welcoming
ethnic enclaves. These are sometimes referred to as the melting
pot versus the salad bowl approaches to accommodating immigrants.
<BR>

<P>
Which type of integration is occurring in your community/region?
Why? What are the major factors affecting integration in this
community/region, e.g., jobs, housing, schooling, governance?
What public policies are most important in regulating the speed
and extent of integration in your community/region, e.g., housing
for families, jobs for adults, or education for children?<BR>

<P>
3. Many newly-arrived immigrants find jobs with the help of ethnic
networks. Do immigrant networks in rural communities confine immigrants
to low-wage jobs, or give them a hand up the job ladder? Some
have speculated that rural communities are distinguished from
immigrant cities such as Los Angeles--where immigrants are concentrated
at the top and the bottom of the skill and earnings distribution--because,
in rural areas, the top or the role models are missing--there
is a pyramid-shaped distribution of skills and earnings, i.e.,
a wide base of low-skill people and jobs that tapers off abruptly.
Is this true in your community/region?<BR>

<P>
4. Federal and state governments are considering decentralization
and block grants--giving less assistance to communities, but allowing
local leaders to decide how to spend assistance funds. How would
decentralization and block grants--plus new restrictions on the
eligibility of legal and unauthorized immigrants for public benefits--affect
immigration patterns in your community/region?<BR>

<P>
<B>Policy Implications Discussion Questions</B>
<P>
1. Are there any particular communities/regions or public or private
policies that stand out in promoting successful integration, or
in impeding immigrant integration? What are the communities that
currently have a majority of foreign-born residents, and continue
to grow by one to five percent per year via immigration, likely
to look like in 10 years if current trends continue, i.e., are
current immigration patterns sustainable?<BR>

<P>
2. What seems to be the most variable affecting the success of
integration--number of immigrants, characteristics of migrants,
situation and attitudes of the community in which they settle,
or some combination of these? What does this variable suggest
about prioritizing government efforts to accelerate integration
in immigrant communities in agricultural areas--should housing,
jobs, education, crime etc.-- be tackled first, and why? <BR>

<OL>
<LI>Federal and state governments are considering decentralization
and block grants--giving less assistance to communities, but allowing

immigration patterns in your community/region?

&quot;The United States risks re-creating rural poverty through

<P>
A conference on Immigration and the Changing Face of Rural California
was held June 12-14 1995 in Asilomar, California, to explore whether
the United States is recreating rural poverty through immigration
in the 1990s. Asilomar was the first of what we hope will be a
series of conferences on immigration and integration issues and
prospects in rural California and rural America. <BR>

<P>
An agenda and the questions that guided the discussion are attached.
<BR>

<P>
The Asilomar conference brought together academic and policy researchers,
community leaders, and activists to consider how immigration is
affecting demographics, economies, and politics in communities
in two California regions: the San Joaquin Valley and the Central
Coast. Studies of rural communities constituted the core of the
conference program. Key findings and conclusions from this conference
should be useful in shaping policy and research agendas on impacts
of immigration in rural areas. <BR>

<P>
The key findings of the June 12-14 1995 conference in Asilomar,
California include:
<P>
1. The towns and cities in major agricultural regions of the state
are growing as a result of immigration and children born to immigrants.
This is evident in towns such as Parlier--two thirds of whose
residents were born abroad; and half of these immigrants arrived
in California after 1980.<BR>

<P>
2. These residents are often poor--from 25 to 50 percent of the
families in these towns have incomes below federal poverty levels,
and 7 of California's 10 poorest cities are &quot;overgrown labor
camps&quot; or farm worker towns [California has 450 cities].
<BR>

<P>
3. Poor immigrants do not affect the towns in which they settle
uniformly. For example, there is closer to a one-to-one relationship
between new residents and housing, and high ratios of new residents
have children in schools. But the correlation between immigration
and public assistance and welfare is lower-- although the rate
at which residents are requesting public assistance in these poor
rural communities is rising sharply.<BR>

<P>
4. Many of the effects of immigrant farm workers on local communities
occur with uncertain lags. Migration is a network phenomenon,
often begun by U.S. recruitment, sustained by poverty in rural
Mexico and jobs in rural California, and then &quot;managed&quot;
by family and village networks that effectively &quot;capture&quot;
desirable items in rural California--particular jobs, labor camps,
or schools--for immigrants from specific communities in Mexico.
<BR>

<P>
5. The economies and labor markets of rural communities are increasingly
layered or segmented in a manner that pushes many of the costs
of seasonal farm work onto the most flexible or absorptive people
present, recently-arrived immigrants. These immigrants, in turn,
are a market for settled local residents, including FLCs who organize
them into crews, those who provide newcomers with housing, meals,
rides to work, and check-cashing services, and those who provide
publicly-supported services to newcomers. Local residents are
usually paid for the services they received in cash, giving them
tax-free income.<BR>

<P>
6. The rural poverty being created through immigration is fundamentally
different from the rural poverty of the postwar south and midwest.
Today's rural poverty is being created via the immigration of
persons with low earnings and little education into an expanding
fruit and vegetable agriculture that increasingly exports the
commodities produced by immigrant farm workers. <BR>

<P>
During the 1950s, and 1960s, by contrast, there were a declining
number of jobs for U.S. citizen farmers and sharecroppers in a
consolidating and mechanizing agriculture. The solution in the
1950s and 1960s was a Great rural-urban Migration involving 1
million persons annually; it is not yet clear what the solution
for 1990s rural poverty will be.<BR>

<P>
7. Rural poverty affects California cities as local residents,
particularly the children of immigrants, seek a livelihood outside
of agriculture. The transfer of rural poverty to urban poverty
highlights the importance of education and training to improve
the prospects for California's rural-to-urban migrants in the
urban economy.
<H1><A NAME="_Toc328892834"><FONT SIZE=4>Introduction</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>
</FONT></H1>

<P>
The idea for this conference emerged from two separate developments.
The first was a national shift in interest in the early 1990s
from immigration policy--how many, from where, and in what status
foreigners arrive--to immigrant or integration policy--what should
be done for immigrants after their arrival to ensure that they
and their children integrate successfully?<BR>

<P>
The second was a long-standing interest in farm labor market trends,
especially the role of seasonal harvest labor markets as a port
of entry for especially rural Mexican immigrants into the US.
<BR>

<P>
Three concerns provided the backdrop for the conference. 
<UL>
<LI>First, the public resources available to integrate newcomers
are declining even though the number of immigrants is increasing.
<LI>Second, seasonal farm work is done primarily by foreigners
who have recently arrived in the U.S. and who have few other U.S.
job options. 
<LI>Third, despite farm labor surpluses and a variety of factors
that combine to prevent immigrant farm workers from finding nonfarm
jobs, rural Mexicans continue to arrive in rural California, fueling
population growth and poverty. 
</UL>

<P>
In the past, immigration policy was integration policy in rural
America. Everyone &quot;knew&quot; that workers with other U.S.
job options would abandon seasonal farm work, so the U.S. government
permitted or tolerated the entry of new immigrants into the seasonal
farm labor market.
<P>
Conference participants are familiar with towns and cities in
the agricultural areas of California. They were asked to consider
a simple question with far-reaching socioeconomic ramifications:
Are we re-creating rural poverty through immigration? If rural
poverty is increasing, what is likely to happen to especially
poor rural residents and their children? Will they stay in rural
areas and accept the jobs available, will they receive education
and training and attract industries that transform rural economies,
will they rely on public assistance, or will they move?
<H1><A NAME="_Toc328892835"><FONT SIZE=4>Three Themes</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>
</FONT></H1>

<P>
Three themes run through the conference papers. 
<P>
First, there is no end in sight to the current wave of immigrants.
This gives rise to a potential contradiction between immigration
and integration policies. There is widespread agreement that the
children of farm workers raised and educated in the U.S. avoid
seasonal farm work, so that, under current conditions, seasonal
farm workers do not reproduce themselves in the U.S. <BR>

<P>
This makes integration a Sisyphean task, a never-ending quest
to undo the poverty that often results from seasonal farm work.
Farmers will continue to ensure that newly-arrived seasonal farm
workers are available, and communities and assistance programs
will continue to strive to provide them and their children with
the education needed for nonfarm jobs. In theory, this should
cause tension between farm employers who rely on immigrant workers
and efforts to integrate these workers into better-paying jobs.
However, it does not, largely because successful integration efforts
that encourage and permit farm worker children to find nonfarm
jobs reinforce growers' assertions that U.S. workers won't do
farm work, so the only option is to import new workers from abroad,
setting in motion another cycle of escape from the farm labor
market.
<P>
Second, it is clear the number of needy people in the towns and
cities surrounding the state's farms has increased faster than
the number of people on public assistance. Unlike the 1 to 1 relationship
between child population growth and school enrollment, the rate
at which poor people apply for and receive public assistance in
rural areas is slower than the rate at which their numbers are
increasing. <BR>

<P>
This raises the question of whether the gap between need and public
assistance simply is a reflection of knowledge and legal obstacles,
or whether it represents a behavioral difference; i.e., are private
networks filling assistance needs in rural areas privately, so
that only education needs are publicly visible. A question of
significant public policy import is whether the gap between need
and public assistance in rural America is a short-term or long-term
phenomenon.
<P>
Third, the binational labor market is so well established between
rural Mexico and rural California that the U.S. must take an interest
in rural Mexico. Failure to promote rural development in Mexico
will inevitably lead to the need to launch rural development efforts
in the U.S to integrate the rural Mexicans who move here. 
<H1><A NAME="_Toc328892836"><FONT SIZE=4>Immigration Patterns
and Immigrant Policies</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4> </FONT></H1>

<P>
There are many models of immigrant effects on local populations
and economies. Two models mark the extremes. One argues that there
are economies of scale and multiplier effects of immigrant workers,
so that the arrival of immigrants increases local economic activity
and creates or preserves good jobs for local residents. <BR>

<P>
The other extreme argues that immigrants take over local jobs
and freeze low wages into place, so that the continued arrival
of unskilled immigrants transforms the economy into something
resembling the migrants' place of origin, and local workers who
would have to compete with immigrants tend to migrate away. This
gives rise to the so-called import-third-world-immigrants-and-get-third-world-conditions
syndrome.<BR>

<P>
An analysis of census-tract data from 12 agricultural counties
in central California suggest that immigrants represent a two-edged
sword for rural California. One the one hand, their labor is critical
to an expanding labor-intensive agricultural sector. On the other
hand, immigration into rural communities is associated with rising
poverty, public assistance, and underemployment rates. <BR>

<P>
Influxes of low-skilled immigrant workers may release human-resource
constraints and create income linkages promoting local income
growth, as suggested by the optimistic model. However, the benefits
of this income growth are unevenly distributed. Low wages and
high unemployment rates are endemic at the bottom end of the job
ladder, where most immigrants to rural California are concentrated,
as suggested by the pessimistic view. <BR>

<P>
The combination of growth-promoting immigration and a broad base
of jobs with limited earnings prospects leads to the seemingly
paradoxical outcome of a positive association between immigration
and income growth, but also a correlation between immigration
and poverty growth.
<H1><A NAME="_Toc328892837"><FONT SIZE=4>Migration Networks</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>
</FONT></H1>

<P>
Migration networks have evolved to assure U.S. farms a reliable
supply of low-skill immigrant labor. Mexican immigrants have traditionally
come from 6 western Mexican states centered around Guadalajara.
These states include almost 20 percent of Mexico's population.
<BR>

<P>
Increasingly, networks of family contacts take migrants from these
states to urban rather than agricultural U.S. jobs. The &quot;new-new&quot;
migrants in California agriculture are primarily from the 3 southwestern
states in Mexico, which include about 10 percent of Mexico's population
but large concentrations of Mexico's poor people. <BR>

<P>
Unlike migrants from western Mexico, who were recruited under
the Bracero program to work in U.S. agriculture, Mixtecs from
Oaxaca became U.S. migrants in a stage process that began with
growers in Sinaloa and Baja California who recruited them to travel
to northern Mexico, and then U.S. recruiters encouraged them to
migrate across the border.
<P>
As the newest arrivals, Mixtecs are at the bottom of the agricultural
job ladder. However, unlike migrants from western Mexico who waited
until they had found more-or-less permanent tractor driver or
irrigator jobs to unify their families in the U.S., some Mixtecs
believe a series of seasonal jobs provides sufficient stability
to justify family unification in the U.S.
<H1><A NAME="_Toc328892838"><FONT SIZE=4>Colonias in The Central
Valley</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4> </FONT></H1>

<P>
California has about 450 cities, and an analysis of 120 of them
found that colonias--mostly Hispanic towns and cities--are replacing
barrios, cities with a section in which Hispanics are concentrated.
Across these colonias, indicators of low earnings and poverty
increased between 1980 and 1990--the percent of the population
with below poverty level earnings increased from 15 to 20 percent,
while the percent of adults without a high school diploma rose
from 50 to 54 percent.<BR>

<P>
Studies of colonias reveal a challenging problem in evaluating
the costs and benefits of immigration in rural California: the
major beneficiaries of immigration tend to live outside the communities
that bear the costs of servicing the needs of large numbers of
low-skilled immigrant farm workers with poor earnings and unstable
employment. This means that studies of individual colonias can
lead to a pessimistic view of immigration's impacts. <BR>

<P>
Labor-intensive agriculture, by drawing large numbers of workers
from abroad and offering many of them only poverty-level earnings
and employment, creates a negative externality for these rural
communities, i.e., the cost of meeting the public service needs
of farm workers whose paychecks cannot support them.<BR>

<P>
The demographic and economic trends identified by the &quot;macro&quot;
studies typically are magnified in individual &quot;micro&quot;
community case studies. Seven studies presented at the conference
provide a starting point for piecing together a picture of how
immigration is reshaping rural California communities.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc328892839"><FONT SIZE=4>Parlier</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>
</FONT></H2>

<P>
Parlier is a city of 10,000 about 20 miles southeast of Fresno.
It is over 97 percent Hispanic. Its history illustrates the demographic
transition occurring in rural California. It was 95 percent non-Hispanic
white in 1921 and 70 percent Hispanic in 1970. In 1972, after
schooling and police disputes, Hispanics replaced Whites on the
city council.<BR>

<P>
Grapes and tree fruits dominate the agriculture around Parlier,
and the nature of seasonal labor needs in these commodities has
led in most cases to a three-tiered labor force-- a few year-round
workers (1/7), more long-season local workers (1/5), and mostly
peak season migrants (2/3). This means that the job pyramid in
local agriculture is narrow at the top.<BR>

<P>
Parlier's economy has long been based on serving farm workers,
including those employed in nonfarm but ag-related industries
such as packing and processing. Like many other cities in rural
California, Parlier grew rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s as
farmers eliminated on-farm housing for workers. The city constructed
low-income housing to help fill the housing gap. However, Parlier
is now on a housing treadmill. As new migrants continue to arrive,
established residents rent out their garages and backyards, and
a constant or higher percentage of the city's residents wind up
in poor housing. <BR>

<P>
Provision of services like housing, job contracting, transportation
and food to a large seasonal influx of farm workers creates some
income and employment for established residents, in a manner analogous
to a tourist town. However, the poverty-level earnings of most
farm workers severely limits incomes in these immigrant service
activities. The best local jobs are held by those who use public
funds to provide education, health, and other public services
to farm workers.<BR>

<P>
A high percentage of Parlier residents is poor, but relatively
few receive public assistance. Public assistance in Parlier seems
to go to poor people who have an attachment to the labor force,
in contrast to the nearby city of Fresno where a higher percentage
of recipients seem to receive aid for long periods. Legal obstacles
to immigrants obtaining public assistance, together with strong
network support among immigrants, probably help explain these
differences. The state-run migrant camp--reportedly isolated from
the city despite being inside city limits--houses workers who
spend 6 months each year in south Texas or Mexico. The children
of camp workers sometimes follow their parents to the fields.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc328892840"><FONT SIZE=4>Madera</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>
</FONT></H2>

<P>
Madera county has about 100,000 residents, about one-third of
whom are Hispanic. Raisin grapes and other commodities in the
county have long relied on seasonal Mestizo workers from the western
Mexican state of Michoacan but, since the mid-1980s, Mixtec Indians
from Oaxaca have become the major entry-level workers. <BR>

<P>
This ethnic succession raises interesting questions, including
whether or not the Mixtecs arriving in Madera in the 1990s can
expect to achieve the same upward mobility achieved by previous
farm workers from Michoacan, who replaced white farm workers in
an expanding labor intensive agriculture. Immigrants currently
are experiencing falling earnings relative to whites, and there
is evidence of rising competition between established Mestizo
and burgeoning Mixtec migration networks for more desirable, year-round
jobs.
<P>
Madera illustrates the dilemma inherent in managing seasonal labor
in rural California. Most residents pay at least lip service to
the notion that education should be improved so that farm worker
children are not &quot;trapped&quot; in poverty. But the same
educational opportunities that prepare farm worker children for
nonfarm jobs ensure that they will not be seasonal farm workers
themselves, putting the county on an immigrant farm worker treadmill
in which new groups of immigrants are encouraged to fill seasonal
job vacancies, and the community struggles to ensure that their
children can achieve the better life to which they aspire.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc328892841"><FONT SIZE=4>Famersville and McFarland</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>
</FONT></H2>

<P>
Famersville and McFarland are towns of about 7000 residents each
in which half of the labor force are farm or food processing workers,
prompting them to be labeled by some as &quot;incorporated labor
camps.&quot; In both cities, there are relatively few businesses,
and they have low sales, so that there are low sales tax and public
revenues. <BR>

<P>
These communities represent a striking juxtaposition of concentrated
rural poverty amidst a prosperous agriculture. Rising poverty
in the two towns is associated with an oversupply of immigrant
workers and displacement of local workers (mostly older immigrants)
by new immigrant groups from southern Mexico. Here, as in Parlier,
settled residents provide low-cost services to farm workers. Higher
income groups have moved outside the communities.<BR>

<P>
The farm workers in Farmersville and McFarland appear to be unifying
their families in California. A combination of factors--legal
status, U.S. wages and benefits including unemployment benefits,
and the sense that there is little economic future in rural Mexico--help
to explain why rural Mexican migrants increasingly are becoming
residents of cities in the agricultural areas of California.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc328892842"><FONT SIZE=4>Fresno: the Rural-Urban
Connection</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4> </FONT></H2>

<P>
Two things flow out of small rural towns into the rapidly expanding
cities of California's central valley: second-generation immigrants,
and large business. Cities are a magnet for sons and daughters
of immigrant farm workers who do not see a future for themselves
doing farm work. <BR>

<P>
Conference participants also provided numerous examples of &quot;Main
Streets&quot; of rural communities shutting down, as local residents
turn to regional shopping centers to be their primary suppliers
of goods. Only businesses providing goods and services not easily
traded across the distances separating rural residents from the
closest urban area remain, leaving a string of empty store fronts
in the downtowns of rural communities.<BR>

<P>
Fresno county dominates the demographic and economic landscape
of the Central Valley. Fresno county has annual agricultural commodity
sales of $3 billion, about one-sixth of the CA total, and more
than the farm sales of states such as New York and South Dakota.
The county had about 670,000 residents in 1990, about 60 percent
of whom lived in the Fresno-Clovis metropolitan area. <BR>

<P>
By 1995, the county's population is estimated to be almost 800,000,
with half in the city of Fresno, one-quarter in 14 incorporated
cities, and one-quarter in the rest of the county. Fresno-Clovis
is a predominantly non-Hispanic white city, while the percentage
of Hispanics in cities such as Mendota, Huron, and Parlier tops
90 percent.<BR>

<P>
Non-Hispanic whites are the oldest residents, so that, e.g., the
Hispanic and Asian percentage of the city&iacute;s school enrollment
is greater than their percentage of the city&iacute;s population.
One third of the county&iacute;s population is younger than 18.
<BR>

<P>
There are about 300,000 employed persons in the county, including
20 percent in agriculture and 10 percent in manufacturing. County
wide, 90 percent of total employment is in 5 sectors--trade, services,
and government each have 20 percent. The average annual unemployment
rate was 14 percent in 1992-93.<BR>

<P>
Fresno county has a relatively low-wage economy, largely because
of the importance of low-wage agriculture in the economy and the
fact that about 2/3 of the manufacturing jobs are in non-durables.
The percentage of Fresno county&iacute;s population with less-than-poverty
level incomes jumped between 1980 and 1990. About 30 percent of
the county&iacute;s residents received public assistance near
the end of 1993. Rates of public assistance varied by race/ethnicity--about
10 percent for non-Hispanic whites, versus almost 40 percent for
Hispanics, and over 60 percent of Blacks.<BR>

<P>
Surveys of farm workers, many of whom are SAWs, suggest that most
want nonfarm jobs, but lack of English and skills keep them in
the farm work force. Most do not learn English, or live in areas
and work in situations in which they need to learn English. Farm
workers with children often rely on them to translate for them.
<BR>

<P>
It appears that most first generation immigrant farm worker do
not have an opportunity to learn English. Their children do, and
they develop both aspirations for nonfarm jobs and rights to public
assistance. The race in Fresno county is to determine whether
the nonfarm jobs in the area, public assistance, or migration
away from Fresno will prove more attractive to the immigrant children
of farm workers.
<H1><A NAME="_Toc328892843"><FONT SIZE=4>Coastal </FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>Colonias:
Guadalupe and Shandon </FONT></H1>

<P>
Guadalupe is a city of 6000 in Santa Barbara county that that
has long relied on Mexican immigrant workers. The argument made
about Guadalupe is that the nature of agricultural production
produces poverty, not continuing immigration. However, labor-intensive
agriculture may not have expanded in the area without the availability
of flexible immigrant workers.<BR>

<P>
Shandon is another farm worker town of 700 that switched from
cattle and grains to producing more labor-intensive crops, especially
grapes. As the number of seasonal farm workers increased, so did
the number of newly-arrived immigrant Hispanics, who were visible
in the small town--Hispanics are about one-third of the town's
population. Crowding in substandard housing led to visibility
and conflict with local residents, especially those who were not
dependent on seasonal Mexican immigrant workers. Eventually, farm
workers were dispersed to less visible locations outside the town.
<BR>

<P>
It is important to emphasize that California, which has a proportionately
small rural or nonmetro population, is experiencing rapid population
growth in the towns and cities in major farming areas, so that
farm evolution is not associated with population decline in surrounding
communities in California, as it is in the midwest. <BR>

<P>
Second, in the race between mechanization and the expansion of
agricultural production, the net number of seasonal farm jobs
seems to be stable, at least at the state level, which means that
there are more jobs for seasonal workers in some parts of the
state. Third, an apparently vibrant and expanding agricultural
industry is associated with more visible poverty among farm workers.
<H1><A NAME="_Toc328892844"><FONT SIZE=5>Policy Alternatives</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=5>
</FONT></H1>

<P>
U.S. history is in part the story of how agriculture dealt with
the need for seasonal farm workers in a nation that offered enough
nonfarm opportunities that it was very hard to maintain a work
force willing to accommodate itself to the needs of seasonal agriculture.
Over the last 150 years, the seasonal work force evolved from
a mix of slaves, families of farm workers, and seasonal hired
hands to mostly hired workers. The seasonal hired farm labor market,
in turn, has developed institutions that turn many of the costs
associated with low seasonal earnings over to workers themselves--and
to the communities that house them.
<P>
For example, lower-than-average farm wages, it was once argued,
were offset in part by employer-provided housing and other in-kind
benefits. But across the United States, the story of the 1980s
and 1990s is that employer-provided benefits are shrinking and
wages are not rising in compensation, so effective real farm worker
earnings are shrinking. This makes seasonal farm jobs less attractive
to workers with other options, and ensures that only the newest
and most desperate immigrants are eager for seasonal jobs.
<P>
Increasing socio-economic distance between farmers and workers
only compounds the isolation of the farm labor market. With farmers
dealing more and more with farm labor contractor (FLC) middlemen
who compete for their farm work on the basis of cost, farmers
know less and less about &quot;their workers,&quot; and take less
responsibility for them. Laws that seek to force growers to take
more responsibility for seasonal workers generally include loopholes
and, in any event, are not uniformly enforced. One advantage to
farmers of employing labor through FLCs is that the FLCs seem
to be able to avoid effective labor and tax law enforcement.
<P>
Changes in the farm labor market make it unlikely that immigrant
farm workers and their children will achieve upward mobility there.
Several conference participants proposed a combination of efforts
to slow immigration, training second-generation immigrants to
compete in urban labor markets, and developing nonagricultural
employment in rural and urban areas to provide workers with alternatives
to low-paying seasonal farm work. <BR>

<P>
However, solutions like these lead to the policy dilemma of how
to encourage mobility of immigrant farm workers and their children
while at the same time guaranteeing a supply of labor to fill
seasonal farm jobs. California's prosperous agriculture is a revolving-door
employer of new immigrants, and attempts to integrate new immigrants
into the U.S. economy speed up the revolving door. In the process,
poverty continues to be transferred from rural Mexico to rural
California through immigration, and then into urban California,
through the migration of farm workers and their children out of
agriculture.
<P>
There are no easy alternatives to revolving door farm worker poverty.
One option would be to push up farm wages, either by reducing
immigration, by raising minimum wages and enforcing labor laws,
or through collective bargaining. The supply of US workers should
increase as a result--perhaps as workers revolve through the farm
labor market slower--and the demand should drop significantly,
as farmers use labor more efficiently, mechanize, and change crops.
<BR>

<P>
A second alternative is to argue that the farm labor market should
be maintained as it is, but that seasonal farm workers should
be guest workers who do not earn the right to stay in the US.
In this manner, the revolving door would operate to and from rural
Mexico, rather than from rural Mexico to rural California and
rural America. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Conference Questions and Guidelines<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
This is a working conference; we expect the 45 participants to
participate actively with researchers and local government officials
to discuss developments in these communities and what might be
done. A conference to discuss the policy implications of the rural
community studies presented at this conference is planned for
1997 in Washington DC.<BR>

<P>
<B>Community Studies Discussion Questions</B>
<P>
1. What are the major issues--pluses and minuses--associated with
high rates of immigration--adding one percent or more to the population
every year via immigration, or doubling the population of the
community when seasonal workers arrive? How would these issues
be affected if the inflow of new immigrants were stopped or significantly
reduced into your community, the aim of current border control
efforts and immigration reform legislation?<BR>

<P>
2. There is no generally accepted definition of immigrant integration.
However, when two or more distinct groups share a geographic area,
two extremes delineate their possible interaction--<B>integration
or assimilation</B> means eliminating boundaries between groups,
encouraging convergence in language, values, earnings etc. <B>Pluralism
or multiculturalism</B>, on the other hand, means encouraging
the maintenance of cultural diversity, and tolerating or welcoming
ethnic enclaves. These are sometimes referred to as the melting
pot versus the salad bowl approaches to accommodating immigrants.
<BR>

<P>
Which type of integration is occurring in your community/region?
Why? What are the major factors affecting integration in this
community/region, e.g., jobs, housing, schooling, governance?
What public policies are most important in regulating the speed
and extent of integration in your community/region, e.g., housing
for families, jobs for adults, or education for children?<BR>

<P>
3. Many newly-arrived immigrants find jobs with the help of ethnic
networks. Do immigrant networks in rural communities confine immigrants
to low-wage jobs, or give them a hand up the job ladder? Some
have speculated that rural communities are distinguished from
immigrant cities such as Los Angeles--where immigrants are concentrated
at the top and the bottom of the skill and earnings distribution--because,
in rural areas, the top or the role models are missing--there
is a pyramid-shaped distribution of skills and earnings, i.e.,
a wide base of low-skill people and jobs that tapers off abruptly.
Is this true in your community/region?<BR>

<P>
4. Federal and state governments are considering decentralization
and block grants--giving less assistance to communities, but allowing
local leaders to decide how to spend assistance funds. How would
decentralization and block grants--plus new restrictions on the
eligibility of legal and unauthorized immigrants for public benefits--affect
immigration patterns in your community/region?<BR>

<P>
<B>Policy Implications Discussion Questions</B>
<P>
1. Are there any particular communities/regions or public or private
policies that stand out in promoting successful integration, or
in impeding immigrant integration? What are the communities that
currently have a majority of foreign-born residents, and continue
to grow by one to five percent per year via immigration, likely
to look like in 10 years if current trends continue, i.e., are
current immigration patterns sustainable?<BR>

<P>
2. What seems to be the most variable affecting the success of
integration--number of immigrants, characteristics of migrants,
situation and attitudes of the community in which they settle,
or some combination of these? What does this variable suggest
about prioritizing government efforts to accelerate integration
in immigrant communities in agricultural areas--should housing,
jobs, education, crime etc.-- be tackled first, and why? <BR>

<OL>
<LI>Federal and state governments are considering decentralization
and block grants--giving less assistance to communities, but allowing
local leaders to decide how to spend assistance funds. How would
decentralization and block grants--plus new restrictions on the
eligibility of legal and unauthorized immigrants for public benefits--affect
immigration patterns in your community/region?<BR>

<a name="RTFToC2">Immigration
and Internal Migration Promote Balkanization</a></a>
</a></h2>
<p>
William Frey's analysis of 1990 census data found that especially unskilled
US-born residents moved out of the cities and states to which immigrants moved
between 1985 and 1990.  Balkanization would result if minority immigrants
continued to move into cities such as Los Angeles and states such as
California, which are increasingly being abandoned by unskilled whites.  <p>
<p>
Detailed analysis by Nancy Bolton of the UCLA-BFP forecasting group indicates
that such a balkanization process was underway in California in the early
1990s.  According to Bolton's estimates, California added 66,000 net new
residents between 1990 and 1993 but, during this period, the state gained a net
133,000 less-than-high-school-educated residents and 76,000 college-educated
residents, and lost a net 143,000 high school graduates. <p>
<p>
Freya Schultz of Santa Barbara county shows that, as labor-intensive strawberry
production increased in the county,  so did the influx of
less-than-high-school-educated migrants.  Furthermore, with increased
employment seasonality, and that many of these unauthorized workers cannot
lawfully draw unemployment insurance benefits, AFDC cases have taken on a
seasonal pattern, with unemployed workers seeking benefits for their US-born
and citizen children. <p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Economic
Uncertainty Motivates Rethinking Immigration Policy</a></a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Demetrios Papademetriou, who has replaced Doris Meissner as head of the
Carnegie Endowment's Immigration Policy Program, believes that the US "appears
to be on the verge of a fundamental reexamination of its views on immigration"
that is "potentially fateful"  because the US is in a period of "pervasive
economic uncertainty."   This uncertainty, in turn, derives from layoffs in
"recession-proof" industries such as financial services and defense, especially
in California.  Papademetriou says that anti-immigrant politicians have been
able to exploit the "social tensions" that always accompany immigration, and
that "no politician has felt compelled to actively resist this anti-immigration
tide."<p>
<p>
According to Papademetriou:  "immigrants are successfully absorbed into the US
labor market."...the overall economic contributions of immigration exceed its
economic liabilities" and "immigration clearly improves the US' ability to
compete "in the global economy.  Furthermore, the formation of ethnic
communities is thought to spawn and strengthen international links that
facilitate the exchange of goods and capital."  Papademetriou allows that "the
picture is not uniformly positive," since immigrant workers may act as an
economic-distorting subsidy in some industries.  <p>
<p>
According to Papademetriou, legal and illegal immigrants have similar
experiences in US labor markets, and the overall impacts of immigrant workers
on US workers is small.  Papademetriou says that immigration is interwoven with
decline in agriculture, garments, and shoes, so that it is not possible to say
whether immigration contributed to falling wages and conditions in these
industries, or whether falling wages etc. caused by other factors led Americans
to abandon these jobs, creating an opening for immigrants.   <p>
<p>
Papademetriou argues that immigration creates government jobs for US workers
(to provide the immigrants with government services), jobs for similar
immigrants in ethnic enclaves, and an overall increase in jobs to provide the
housing and other services immigrants consume.  Papademetriou contrasts the
generally positive conclusions about the effects of immigrants on the
macroeconomy with the negative conclusions of case studies, but concludes that
his "synthesis is even more tentative that the body of literature on which it
is based."   <p>
<p>
Papademetriou predicts that "an all-out fight centering on the costs and
benefits of immigration" will really be a proxy for larger issues facing the
US.  He warns that the fight will be based on  inadequate data, although he
predicts that those who emphasize the costs of immigration will win the
headlines.  Second, Papademetriou expects the coming fight over immigration to
end the US "age of innocence" with immigration, which presumably means the end
of an era in which the US simply assumed that immigration was on balance mostly
beneficial to the country.<p>

Issues New Visa Requirements for Skilled Foreign Workers</a></a>

<p>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service is making final a regulation easing
new requirements imposed by the 1990 Immigration Act on employers wishing to
obtain temporary employment visas for highly skilled  foreign workers.  The
rule changes a provision in the 1990 IMMACT requiring prospective employers to

Work in Neighboring Costa Rica</a></a>

<p>
Costa Rican border officials permit Nicaraguan farm hands to cross the frontier
to overcome seasonal shortages of sugar and coffee harvesters.  Some 7,000
workers migrate into Costa Rica for the sugar harvest, usually for the months
of December and January.  Unemployment in Nicaragua affects almost 50 percent
of the population, versus 5.5 percent in Costa Rica.  <p>
<p>
Migrant workers save about $22 monthly, not much higher than what they could
earn in Nicaragua.  Costa Rican officials say those who are hired directly by
farms get better deals and can earn up to $500 monthly.  The procedure for
hiring migrant workers is monitored by Costa Rica's labor ministry, which
usually transports the workers or supervises their trip to the farms.  The
biggest problems are with workers who seek jobs in the thriving banana
industry; most work without contracts, and many are poorly treated. <p>

<a name="RTFToC8">New
EU Immigration Rights Proposed</a></a>
</a></h2>
<p>
According to many observers, " Immigration is the largest and most contentious
problem facing the European Union."  The EU is preparing to issue a charter of
rights for the 9 million citizens of non-EU nations who are living legally in
an EU nation, such as Turks established in Germany.  Under the proposed
charter, these third country nationals could work anywhere in the 12 nation EU,
and the EU would take steps to better integrate them with enhanced training
opportunities and guarantees of equal rights. <p>
<p>
The proposals are contained in a document from Padraig Flynn, a former Irish
Justice Minister and Commissioner for Social Policy and Immigration.  According
to Flynn, "'immigration to Europe has been a positive development with
substantial economic and social benefits.''  Flynn's proposals are the first
indication of how the Maastricht treaty may allow the European Union to spread
its influence into areas previously reserved for national governments. <p>
<p>
The Commissioner's  recommendations are based on three themes.  First, the
European Union should help to create new rights for legally resident
immigrants.  Second, immigrants should be encouraged to integrate rather than
to retain their original citizenship.  Third, there should be a way for EU
nations to  burden share in immigration issues. The document also recommends
tougher measures against illegal immigrants.<p>

<a name="RTFToC9">Workers
from CIS Flood Russia; New Controls Announced</a></a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Hundreds of thousands Ukrainians and Belarusans are migrating to Russia,
attracted by a stable currency and jobs local workers shun. <p>
<p>
The official unemployment rate in Russia is one percent, and most observers
believe that the true rate is less than 5 percent.  However, inadequate housing
market and government residency regulations keep unemployed or underemployed
Russians from moving to labor shortage areas, such as Moscow, leaving vacancies
in some of Russia's least desirable jobs that can be filled by migrant workers.
<p>
<p>
At least 300,000 migrant workers, mostly from Ukraine and Belarus, have
contracts that let them work legally in Russia.  The total number of migrants
is estimated to be half a million or more.<p>
<p>
Concern about foreign workers led Boris Yeltsin in December 1993 to issue two
decrees: "On Measures to Introduce Immigration Control" and "On the Hiring and
Use of Foreign Labor in the Russian Federation".  <p>
<p>
The first establishes the Russian Federation Federal Migration Service  to
regulate the employment of foreign workers.  Russian employers who want to
employ foreign workers must to request a work permit  and to include the
opinion of local authorities, a draft contract that specifies the wages and
working conditions being offered, and assurances that the employment of foreign
workers will not have an "unfavorable impact on the employment conditions for
Russian citizens."<p>
<p>
The second document gives Russian citizens priority to fill vacant job
positions.  Employers wishing to hire foreign workers must pay a fee equivalent
to one month's minimum wage for each  foreign worker  hired.  Foreigners who
come to Russia to engage in professional activities and are hired in violation
of the Statute on Hiring Foreign Labor in the Russian Federation will be
subject to deportation at the employer's expense.  If employers hire foreign
workers without the appropriate permits, they can be liable for additional
penalties not yet specified.<p>

The German government announced proposals to deregulate the labor market,
promote new businesses and stem rising unemployment.  Key measures include the
legalization of private employment agencies to end the state monopoly on
matching workers with jobs, special inducements for the long-term unemployed to
take seasonal jobs or low-paid work in the community, and moves to promote more
part-time work in both state and private sectors. <p>

The government plan also clamps down on employers of illegal foreign workers,

Birth Dearth and Foreign Workers</a></a>

A "birth dearth" in Europe resulted in the use of  guestworkers instead of
allowing wages and markets to adjust to slower workforce growth.  Nearly 20
percent of the EU population is over 60  By 2010, there will be more EU
residents drawing unemployment that contributing toward them with current early

working immigrants are an important source of funding for the pensions and

Charles Pasqua, French interior minister,  who had made statements that France
should have "zero migration and promised to start sending planeloads of illegal
immigrants home "until the world got the message''  now says that up to 100,000
foreign workers a year will be needed to fill vacant jobs for which French
workers are either unqualified or unwilling to fill.  German politicians also
now acknowledge that non-German contributions to pension and welfare programs
are necessary.  A spokesman for the Social Democrats reports that the two
million foreigner workers in Germany contribute 10 percent of the national
output, and pay an even greater proportion of taxes and pension fund
contributions.<p>

Reports on Foreign Workers</a></a>
</a></h2>
<p>
In the first three quarters of 1993, Poland issued 7,889 work permits to
foreign workers , according to the  Central Statistical Office (GUS).  Foreign
workers came to Poland from 104 countries, but one-third were Ukrainians (16.1
percent) and Russians (13.1).  Other nationalities included Vietnamese (7.6),
Americans(4.8) and British workers(3.6 percent).  Foreigners are most often
employed in construction, trade, the catering business, transportation and
communications, culture and arts, and non-conventional medicine.  Ukrainians,
Belarusans, Russians and Chinese are most often employed in construction,
Vietnamese dominate in commerce and catering, while U.S. and British citizens
work mainly in education.  Non-conventional medicine is a domain of Russians
and Mongols.<p>
<p>
The largest group of  foreign workers  fall in the blue-collar category (27.1
percent).  Managers of companies with mixed and foreign capital received 21.8
percent of the permits.  Those employed as specialists, experts and advisors
were 15.4 percent of the total.<p>
<p>
The State Labor Inspectorate (PIP) estimates that about 20 percent of the Poles
employed in the private sector, over 1.2 million people, work illegally,
usually by being registered as unemployed and drawing unemployment benefits
while also working.  The PIP estimates that several thousand Belarusans,
Lithuanians, Russians and Ukrainians work illegally in Poland.  Most often they
find seasonal jobs in agriculture and construction.<p>

<a name="RTFToC18">Rise
of Foreign Workers in Malaysia</a></a>
</a></h2>
<p>
In January, 1994, Malaysia  launched a crackdown against the  foreigners who
are working illegally in the country.  The federal government issued a
directive, freezing work permits for foreign workers.  In late January, the
Malaysian government announced that it was considering caning, or the flogging
of the buttocks with a thick cane, to discourage illegal workers from entering
its borders. <p>
<p>
Employers in the construction and plantation industries have expressed concern
that any wide-ranging moves against  foreign workers  would lead to serious
production shortfalls.  On some plantations up to 80 per cent of workers are
foreigners, most of them Indonesian or Bangladeshi.<p>
<p>
Malaysia has gone from a country with double digit unemployment to full
employment in less than ten years.  The unemployment rate for 1993 was 3 per
cent.  Wage increases also rose with productivity.  As a result,  all major
sectors of the economy are experiencing labor shortages.  Foreign workers had
to be recruited by the government to overcome labor shortages.  In the
beginning, mostly Indonesians workers were brought in for the plantation
sector.  This was later extended to cover services and manufacturing. <p>
<p>
A U.S. Embassy report says that with a population of 19 million, Malaysia has a
labor force of seven million, including up to two million  foreign workers,
still primarily from neighboring Indonesia.  According to the report, about one
million of them are illegal.  Government estimates are somewhat lower, one
million foreign workers with 200,000-250,000 illegal immigrants. <p>
<p>
Malaysian government officials say that illegal immigrants had committed crimes
and had engaged in petty trading and hawking, activities which foreigners were
barred from doing.  The Home Minister warned that the one million foreign
workers  in Malaysia would pose a social problem if the economy were to
decline.  He added that though the freezing of worker permits make it difficult
to resolve the labor shortage, it was necessary for the country's security.<p>

'Philippines 2000'', is an  ambitious new vision for the future proposed by
Philippine President Fidel Ramos, who believes that most Filipinos working
abroad will  return home by the end of the century.  Ramos hopes that by then
the domestic economy will offer enough jobs for the entire population.
According to the government's Philippines Overseas Employers' Association,
686,461 Filipinos were legally registered as overseas contract workers in 1992.
If illegal workers were included, the total would be well over a million, out
of the country's population of 62 million.  About 134,000 are seamen - 16
percent of the total number of seamen in the world.  Others work as maids,
singers, construction workers and hostesses in bars from Saudi Arabia to
Australia.  They send back an estimated pounds 1.4 billion per year to the
Philippines: about 15 per cent of the national budget.<p>

Restricts Foreign Workers, Allows Some Vietnamese</a></a>

<p>
Taiwan has set  strict limits on the categories and numbers of  foreign
workers.   According the chairman of the Council of Labor Affairs, the country
has adopted four guidelines for hiring blue-collar workers: 1) Foreigners
cannot take jobs which locals are willing to do.  Companies have to advertise
in three newspapers for three days, and show that response is poor before
tapping overseas labor; 2) Since wages for  foreign workers  are usually lower
than those for locals, industries may be able to postpone automation by hiring
more outsiders.  Hence, companies must submit improvement plans along with
requests for foreign workers; 3) Entrepreneurs bear the responsibility of
preventing foreigners from becoming permanent residents.  They can stay in the
country for a year, followed by one-year extension of their work permits.; and
4) Foreign workers  should not endanger Taiwan's society.  Management of their
stay in the country is mandatory.<p>
<p>
In a related move, Taiwan labor officials will include Vietnam to the list of
Southeast Asian countries from which workers are allowed to immigrate for two
years.  Taiwan, Vietnam's biggest foreign investor, will adopt an unprecedented
government-to-government labor cooperation agreement to allow 1,000 Vietnamese
nationals to work on the island<p>

<a name="RTFToC2">Immigration's
Costs and Benefits</a> 
</a></h2>
The Brookings Institution held a National Issues Forum in Washington, DC on
February 16, 1994 at which most speakers agreed that the United States must "do
something" about illegal immigration.  However, there was little agreement on
what should be done.<p>
The impetus for the conference seemed to be Governor Pete Wilson's (R-Ca)
assertion that the State of California incurs at least $3.6 billion in
unreimbursed costs to provide services to 1.3 million illegal aliens.  The
costs and benefits of immigrants are becoming a much-debated issue in
Washington, especially after Governor Chiles (D-Fla) sued the United States for
reimbursement, and the governors of Texas, New York and Illinois joined the
call for federal assistance to high immigration states.  These five states
included 81 percent of the 3.2 million illegal aliens that the INS estimated
were in the US in 1992. <p>
Wilson requested that the federal government either: (1) reimburse California
for two-thirds of these costs, or (2) repeal the mandate that California
provide these services.  The Governor's representative cast the issue as one in
which the federal government's failure to enforce immigration laws combined
with mandates to provide services to illegal immigrants imposes an unfair cost
on the states and cities in which they concentrate.<p>
Illegal immigrant children are eligible for free public education (1982 Supreme
Court decision), emergency Medicaid assistance (50-50 federal-state cost
sharing), and school lunch and pre-natal services.  If the federal government
eliminated the mandate to provide, e.g. Medicaid, states could see their costs
rise, since they would then bear the full cost of the emergency health services
that all agreed would in any event be provided.<p>
But what is the basis for the demands that the federal government enforce
immigration laws, repeal mandates to provide services to illegal aliens, or
reimburse states for their costs of providing such services?  It is true that
immigration is at its highest level in 100 years, and that 45 percent of the 20
million foreign-born persons enumerated in the 1990 Census Of Population
arrived since 1980, but some speakers emphasized that research fails to find
that immigrants displace U.S.-born workers or depress their wages, or that
immigrants are more dependent on welfare than U.S. citizens.  Instead, their
argument went, immigrants must be subdivided into categories and, when they
are, refugees have the highest rates of welfare dependency, legal immigrants
aged 15-64 have a lower rate, and illegal aliens have the lowest rate, since
most are trying to avoid seeking even those few services for which they are
eligible.<p>
Most speakers returned to basics to emphasize that the United States welcomes
legal immigrants through three major doors: family unification, humanitarian,
and needed workers.  Several speakers argued that the United States correctly
permits a U.S. citizen with a foreign spouse or dependents to bring them to the
United States immediately, and that it is also good social policy to permit
legal immigrants to have their immediate families join them.  Some speakers
questioned the "minor" family-oriented admissions doors, such as the provision
through which the adult sons and daughters of U.S. citizens can enter, and the
door reserved for the brothers and sisters of U.S. immigrants.  There was also
criticism of the "diversity lottery" that favors immigrants from Europe.<p>
Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the discussion was the agreement that
something must be done about illegal immigration.  There were several paths to
this common action item.  For some, fears of job displacement and wage
depression were sufficient reasons for action.  For others, fears of cultural
upheavals, population growth, or environmental degradation were reasons for
action.  For the states and cities, action is justified by the cost of
providing services, while the INS agreed that widespread lawbreaking
represented by illegal immigration undermined its reputation.  Some of those
advocating prompt and drastic action against illegal immigration outlined a
series of national dilemmas - from the underclass to public education - and
questioned whether more immigrants - legal or illegal - help the nation to
solve these problems.<p>
Most speakers were pro-immigration, and they made their case for action to
reduce illegal immigration on the grounds that, if nothing is done now, there
will be harsher measures later.  Some feared what one termed a "jihad" (holy
war) against immigrants would go "too far."  Several emphasized that
"anti-immigrant hysteria" was due to California's economic woes, the inability
of the INS to effectively enforce immigration laws, and the end of the Cold
War, which undercut support for the foreign-born group most likely to receive
public assistance for extended periods of time - refugees.  These "defenders of
immigrants" hope to keep open the family, refugee, and economic doors for
newcomers by supporting efforts to close the back door to illegal aliens.  <p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Administration's
"Comprehensive Response" to Immigration</a></a>
</a></h2>
On February 3, 1994, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno announced a five-point
plan to curb illegal immigration, speed up the processing of applicants for
asylum, and promote the naturalization of eligible immigrants.  The proposal
fulfills President Clinton's July 1993 promise to deal with immigration when he
named Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner and,
if fully implemented, would raise the INS budget almost 25 percent, from $1.6
billion in FY93 to $2.1 billion in FY95.<p>
1.	AG Reno described the plan to spend $368 million in FY95 to add 1,010 Border
Patrol (BP) agents in El Paso and San Diego as "deterrence through prevention."
Almost two-thirds of all INS apprehensions are made in these two sectors, and
the extra funds would enable the BP to add 620 agents to its current 4,100, to
add lights and another fence in San Diego, and to fingerprint all apprehended
aliens.<p>
2.	An additional $55.2 million per year would enable the INS to deport an
estimated 20,000 criminal aliens each year from California, Texas, Florida, and
Illinois.  <p>
3.	The number of judges hearing requests for asylum would be doubled from 150
to 300 with an additional $64.1 million, so that the number of asylum
applicants who could be processed annually would rise from 45,000 to 150,000.
Asylum applicants would be expected to pay a $130 fee to apply, and would have
to wait 150 days to get a work permit.  With the help of the extra asylum
officers, the 364,000 backlog of asylum cases would eventually be cleared.<p>
4.	The INS would devote $23 million to target for enforcement, under the 1986
employer sanctions law, "high-violator" industries, such as agriculture,
construction, janitorial and similar services, and garments and similar
manufacturing.  The INS plans to reduce from 29 to 3 the number of work
authorization documents a worker can present to an employer, and add a magnetic
stripe to the back of the INS-551 greencard carried by legal immigrants.  In
addition, the telephone system for employers to verify worker documents would
be expanded.<p>
5.	The "balancing" or generosity feature of the plan is a commitment of $30
million annually--half in the form of grants to community groups--to promote
the naturalization of eligible immigrants, those who have been in the United
States at least five years and can pass a rudimentary English and civics
test.<p>
Most of these proposals are part of the Crime Bill moving through Congress, and
may not be implemented unless that bill is enacted.<p>
Reaction to the Administration's plan was generally positive; both Republican
and Democratic politicians in California praised the plan as a "balanced"
effort to deal with reducing illegal immigration and promoting the acceptance
of the newcomers who arrived in the past 10 to 20 years.  FAIR and several
Congressmen criticized the proposal as "too little," and for not beefing up
border enforcement in New Mexico and Arizona.  Other critics argued that the
Administration's plan should have put more emphasis on employer sanctions
enforcement, that preventive deterrence at the border will merely redirect
illegal immigrants around newly-fortified areas, and that the potential for
violence is increased because, with higher coyote fees, migrants will be less
willing to risk apprehension.  Mexico protested that beefing up border
enforcement could "harm relations between neighboring communities" and hinder
the cooperation needed to implement NAFTA.<p>
The House Republican Task Force on Immigration, headed by Lamar Smith
(R-Texas), on February 10, 1994 unveiled its own plan to reduce illegal
immigration.  It would require the INS to construct fences and ditches in areas
where most illegal aliens are apprehended, add 6,000 more Border Patrol agents
to the current 4,000 by 1998, and phase in over five years a tamper-proof
Social Security card that all newly-hired workers would have to present to
their employers.  The Task Force estimated that there are 4.8 million illegal
aliens (versus a 3.5 million INS estimate), and that they cost taxpayers a new
$7.6 billion annually.<p>

Hold the Line in Texas</a></a>
</a></h2>
Frank Bean of the University of Texas-Austin is completing a study of the
effectiveness of Operation Blockade (today known as Operation Hold the Line) on
the US-Mexican border in El Paso.  The Commission on Immigration Reform,
chaired by Barbara Jordan, will review Bean's study at a meeting March 18-19 in
El Paso.<p>
According to Bean, there were 4 distinct types of illegal border crossers, and
the two that caused the most problems in El Paso were stopped, explaining the
popularity of the operation.  Long-distance migrants headed to interior US
locations and daily commuters were not deterred by the massing of agents on the
border--for both groups, crossing the border became less convenient and more
expensive, but was not stopped.  However, Mexican teens who partied in El Paso,
and committed crimes there, as well as sidewalk vendors, were deterred, to the
relief of the people of El Paso.<p>

Federal assistance for rebuilding Los Angeles after the January 17, 1994
earthquake was held up for several days by wrangling in Congress over the
eligibility of illegal aliens for non-emergency assistance funds.  As enacted
on February 11, 1994, the $8.6 billion appropriation permits FEMA to provide
emergency shelter, food, and medical assistance without inquiring about an
individual's legal status, but it requires federal agencies to take
"reasonable" steps to ascertain the legal status of anyone seeking longer-term
aid (lasting more than 90 days) such as 18-month HUD housing grants, about
their legal status.  Democrat Esteba Torres (D-Ca) sponsored the amendment to
prevent an even tougher ban on federal assistance from being passed.<p>

<a name="RTFToC6">Governors
Ask for Federal Reimbursement of Immigrant Costs; Budget Director Says Don't
Count on It</a></a>
</a></h2>
With governors from California (Republican), Florida (Democrat), Illinois (R),
New York (D), and Texas (D) suing or threatening to sue the federal government
to recover their estimated costs of providing services to illegal immigrants,
there is now bipartisan pressure on the federal government to deal with the
issue.  The two Republican and three Democratic governors are turning what had
been seen as an individual crusade by California's Governor Wilson(R) to shift
the blame for the state's problems to Washington into a more serious issue that
can no longer be ignored.  As a result of the pressure, the Clinton
Administration announced on February 1 that it is forming a bipartisan "working
group" to push for federal legislation to help alleviate the costs associated
with illegal immigration. The focus will be on education, emergency health care
and the incarceration of illegal immigrants. <p>
But White House Budget Director Leon Panetta, a former Congressman from
California, warned a group of California lawmakers in Washington, DC to lobby
for increase federal funding on February 22, 1994 that they should not expect
any more funds to help compensate for illegal immigration. <p>
Studies of the public finance impacts of legal and illegal immigrants agree on
only a few points, including:<p>
1.	The taxes paid by especially unskilled and illegal immigrants accrue
primarily to the federal government and its Social Security trust funds.<p>
2.	At the state and local levels, taxes-paid calculations depend heavily on
assumptions about the number, earnings, and U.S. expenditures of illegal
immigrants.  Costs are very sensitive to assumptions about illegal aliens'
receipt of work-related and public benefits, and whether the cost of providing
(required) services such as schooling for illegal alien children or AFDC to
their U.S.-born and citizen babies should be chargeable to illegal aliens
generally.<p>
A new study by Jeffrey Passel, director of immigration research at the Urban
Institute in Washington, DC says that California's immigrants contribute $12
billion more each year in taxes and other payments, than they cost in
schooling, health care and other services. Passel contradicts a study by Donald
Huddle of Rice University,  that immigrants take thousands of jobs from US
workers and cost California more than $18 billion annually. Nationally, Passel
concludes that immigrants contribute $28.7 billion more in taxes than they use
in services. Huddle finds that immigrants cost about $42.5 billion annually.
Both studies did not focus on illegal immigrants, but on all foreigners living
in the country since 1970. <p>

<a name="RTFToC7">US
Labor Department Scrutinizing Temporary Foreign Workers</a></a>
</a></h2>
The Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT) revised the rules under which temporary
foreign workers can be admitted to the US, and one result is an increased
number of US employers applying for temporary foreign programmers and other
computer professionals.  <p>
	US employers wishing to hire foreign workers must complete a Labor Condition
Application (LCA) that asserts that the US employer has tried to recruit US
workers at the prevailing wage for the area or the wage that is paid to similar
workers elsewhere.  The US Department of Labor receives few complaints about
these LCAs: there were only 7 complaints filed about the 100,000 LCAs filed
between October, 1991 and May, 1993.  Complaints skyrocketed during the summer
of 1993, and the TV show 60 Minutes charged that "body shops" were engaged in
massive immigration fraud to obtain low-wage computer programmers.  Three days
after the 60 Minutes program, the DOL proposed regulations that would allow it
to initiate an investigation even if no complaint had been filed.<p>
Many US employers do not adhere to current regulations, which require that a
separate LCA that explains how the prevailing and actual wage were determined
for each foreign worker, that exclude the value of housing or other benefits
from the calculation of wages, and that explain any apparent discrepancies in
pay, such as occur when two programmers have the same job description but
different rates of pay.  US employers might make their LCAs available to
"interested parties" upon request.<p>

<a name="RTFToC8">Devaluations
Increase Mexico-to-US Migration</a></a>
</a></h2>
The threat of increased unwanted migration from Mexico was used to argue for
and against  NAFTA during the Fall 1993 US debate over its ratification.  The
consensus among migration researchers was that Mexico-to-US migration would
first increase as a result of the continued demand-pull of US jobs; increased
supply-push in rural Mexico, as corn prices were lowered over 15 years by 50
percent; and the absence of measures to break the networks that had been
perhaps unexpectedly been strengthened by US immigration reforms in 1986 and
1990.  Most migration researchers nonetheless supported NAFTA as the best
long-term strategy to reduce unwanted Mexican migration.<p>
At a session held February 22, 1994 during the annual meetings of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science in San Francisco, J. Edward Taylor,
a University of California, Davis professor of agricultural economics,
presented evidence that a 10 percent devaluation of the peso has an effect on
increasing emigration that is six times larger than a 10 percent decrease in
the price of corn.  Taylor constructed a CGE model of a village economy with
1989 survey data, and showed that, since half of the villagers are subsistence
corn farmers, they are not hurt, and in some cases helped, by lower corn
prices. <i> </i>In his model, a drop in the price of corn from  $4 to $3.60 per
bushel would increase migration by only 2.6 percent, or from 100 to 103
migrants in this village of 1000.  A 10 percent devaluation of the peso, on the
other hand, would lead in Taylor's simulation to a 17 percent increase in
emigration, from 100 to 117 migrants.   <p>
Taylor's model suggests that rural villagers connected to overseas destinations
by networks know about and respond to exchange rate changes.  Such a migration
response to a devaluation occurred in Nigeria early in 1994 (See Devaluation
Prompts Migration to Nigeria).<p>
Mexico's economy grew just 0.4 percent in 1993, well below the 2.6 percent
growth of 1992 and the three percent expected in 1994.  Both the auto and oil
sectors--both important foreign-exchange earners--contracted in 1993, putting
limits on the social spending the government was expected to undertake in the
1994 election year.  Mexico may raise money by selling off its remaining stake
in Mexican banks, and perhaps by beginning to sell of parts of PEMEX.  Tight
monetary and fiscal polices pursued when the fate of NAFTA was in doubt have
brought interest rates on Mexican treasury bills to below 10 percent for the
first time in 15 years.<p>
Agricultural production rose by 1.8 percent in 1993, compared to a drop of 1.5
percent in 1992.  However, farmers throughout the country are linking their
demands for government assistance to the uprising in Chiapas, and the
government is expected to double its spending on agriculture in 1994.  <p>
The Chiapas uprising seems to have awakened Mexicans to the plight of those
left behind in the rush to restructure Mexico's economy.  Bishop Ruiz of
Chiapas says that Mexico's wealthy must be prepared to redistribute some of
their wealth and thus avoid misery and violence. <p>

<a name="RTFToC9">Multiculturalism
under Fire in Canada</a></a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Canada's 1988 Multiculturalism Act was attacked in the House of Commons after
the government issued its fifth annual report on activities supported under the
act.  In 1993-94, the Multiculturalism Department made grants totaling C$ 25.5
million, half of which is spent on programs that reach all Canadians,
one-fourth of which is spent to combat racism (including the annual March 21
anti-racism day), and one-fourth is spent to support ethnic artists and ethnic
studies.  Multiculturalism was the policy that emerged from a 1971 Royal
Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. <p>
Several Reform MP's demanded that the Multiculturalism Department be abolished.
The grants it currently makes to ethnic groups, they argue, tend to "ghettoize
ethnic minorities," and promote group differences rather than pride in being
Canadian.  During the Fall 1993 campaign, Reform Party leader Preston Manning
called for cutting immigration from 250,000 to 150,000 annually, and end to
federal spending on multicultural activities.  Bloc Quebecois MPs opposed
multiculturalisms because, they asserted, the government's policy ignores
Quebec's distinctiveness.<p>
The government responded that diversity does not have to lead to division, that
newcomers have a right to live in ethnic enclaves, and that multiculturalism
strengthens Canada's economy by forging new international trade links.<p>
Multiculturalism is an especially contentious issue in Toronto, whose almost 4
million residents are 60 percent non-English or French (31 percent of Canada's
27.3 million people in 1991 had neither English or French roots).  Canada's 4.3
million foreign-born residents, 16 percent of the population, are concentrated
in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal.  <p>

Children in US Schools</a></a>
</a></h2>
A study of 5,200 immigrant school children in San Diego, Fort Lauderdale, and
Miami found that the immigrant children performed better in US schools because
they spend three times more hours on homework and have families that stress the
importance of education.  Michigan State University Sociology Professor Ruben
Rumbat and Alejandro Portes studied 8th and 9th grade children with at least
one immigrant parent who were born in the US or had been here for at least 5
years, and found that the "immigrant children" spent an average three hours on
homework per day, versus one hour for children with two US citizen parents.  <p>
The median gradepoint of all students in San Diego was 2.11; that of Vietnamese
and Asian immigrant children was 2.9, while Mexican immigrant children had a
median gradepoint of 2.0.  More than 1 million of California's 5 million school
children do not speak English at home; these data suggest that parental support
and expectations can overcome language barriers to assure US educational
success.<p>
In a related story, a California legislator released videotape of children who
live in Mexico and cross the border daily to attend US  schools.  As a result,
20 percent of the 2200 school children in the Mountain Empire School District
southeast of San Diego are expected to be dismissed because their parents used
false US addresses to enroll them.  Children living in Mexico may attend US
schools by paying an annual tuition of $3,200.<p>

<a name="RTFToC13">EU
Commission Approves Communication on Immigration and Asylum</a></a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The European Commission adopted Immigration Commissioner Padraig Flynn's
suggestions on how to develop a coordinated response to the immigration and
asylum issues facing the European Union. The communication asserts that the
immigration and asylum policies must be integrated into the EU's external
policies. Action would occur at a number of levels including trade, development
and cooperation policies, humanitarian assistance and human rights. The next
phase of the commission will be to use its power to translate the ideas into
action. <p>
The European Commission also approved a call for all European Union member
countries to adopt a common definition of "asylum seeker."  Flynn noted that
all EU countries subscribe to the Geneva Convention, but some interpret it
differently, so that some consider asylum seekers from the former Yugoslavia to
be refugees, while others put them in a temporary displace persons category.<p>
There were 550,000 asylum applications in Europe in 1993, down from 679,900 in
1992 because of a 25 percent drop in applications in Germany, and a 50 percent
drop in applications in France and the UK.  A common asylum policy is
considered necessary because of spillover effects.  When Germany tightened its
asylum policies in mid-1993, both Belgium and the Netherlands saw asylum
applications rise. <p>
Germany has since August 1993 been receiving about 15,000 asylum applicants
monthly.  About 40 percent are from the former Yugoslavia, and 10 percent are
from Turkey; the largest drops are in applications from Romania and Bulgaria.
If the EU adopts a tighter common policy, some fear that Eastern European
nations such as Poland and Czechoslovakia will see a rise in asylum
applications.<p>
Flynn also wants the EU countries to discuss a common immigration policy.
Immigration into the EU is officially stopped, but some countries permit family
unification, the return of citizens abroad, and other types of immigrants to
enter.  The EU is working on a common visa application form for nationals of
those countries that will need a visa to enter the EU.<p>
Britain is expected to strongly object to any plans to give Europe's 10 million
immigrants full Community citizenship. Home Secretary Michael Howard and Prime
Minster John Majors are expected to make it clear that, although Britain will
cooperate with member states on immigration and asylum issues, it will not give
third country nationals settled in France and Germany equal status with
European nationals in Britain. <p>

to Return Croats</a></a>

Germany in September 1993 informed the 60,000 to 100,000 Croats in the country
that they would have to leave the country by April 30, 1994 or face deportation
proceedings.  After sharp criticism, the German government on February 9, 1994
extended until June 30, 1995 the residence rights of Croats who cannot return
to their homes because their homes are in Serbian controlled areas.  However,
those from "peaceful areas" will have to leave Germany between May 1 and
October 31, 1994.  <p>
	The Federal Government's Commissioner for Foreigners, Cornelia
Schmalz-Jacobsen, expressed satisfaction that the Croats were divided into two
groups.  She urged the federal government to reimburse individual states for
the number of refugees within them.  The decision was criticized by those who
argued that conscientious objectors should not be returned to Croatia, and by
those who urged that all Balkan refugees should be allowed to stay in  Germany
until the war there is over.<p>
Germany is reportedly pushing for the return of the Croats because of a housing
shortage and the financial costs of caring for them; not to appease an
anti-immigrant public in an election year in which there is high unemployment.
There were four million unemployed in January 1994, a rate of almost nine
percent in the former West Germany and 17 percent in the former East Germany.
Germany is host to 370,000 people from the former Yugoslavia, and spent DM 5
billion($3 billion) caring for asylum seekers and other immigrants in 1993.<p>

Filipino National Security Adviser Jose Almonte proposed that labor migration
be formally included in the agenda of the Asian Free Trade Area(AFTA) to help
resolve problems associated with illegal workers in Brunei, Singapore and
Malaysia.  Almonte proposed that region-wide ground rules be established to
deal with migrant workers in the region, and that  Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan be persuaded to join the regional labor agreement.<p>
As the largest labor exporter in the region, the Philippines has a special
interest in the problems of migrant workers.  Despite its call for a regional
labor agreement, the Philippines recently began bilateral negotiations with
Malaysia to deal with the estimated 190,000 Filipinos in Sabah.  Malaysia
recognizes 80,000 Filipinos as refugees, and is negotiating a bilateral
agreement with the Philippines over the fate of unauthorized Filipino migrants
in Malaysia.<p>
Filipino migrants still go predominantly to the Middle East:  in 1993, 543,410
workers were deployed abroad, and an additional 145, 758 seafarers.  However,
Filipinos are increasingly migrating to other East Asian nations.  For example,
in 1993, almost as many Filipino migrants were deployed to Taiwan (13,189) as
to Saudi Arabia (13,259), representing a dramatic change from 1992.  Over
80,000 Filipino migrants were sent legally to East Asia in the first half of

Filipinos are working in Taiwan.  <p>

A Changing Picture for Emigrants</a></a>
</a></h2>
Last year, fewer than 100 boat people were reported leaving Vietnam, and 58,000
Vietnamese have since 1989 left refugee camps to return to Vietnam.  A steering
committee for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has declared
that Vietnamese who flee their country will not longer receive automatic
consideration as political refugees, and they would henceforth be treated as
any other asylum-seekers.  This means that the country in which Vietnamese
migrants land can send them home immediately. <p>
About 600,000 "boat people" remain in refugee camps in Asia.  Most are
considered economic refugees and will be returned to Vietnam. <p>
The exception are those in the  Orderly Departure Program, begun in the 1982 .
This is a program for Amerasians and former South Vietnamese officers and
officials  and their families who were held as political prisoners.  About
3,500 people in the Amerasian program will enter  the US by the end of the
Summer 1994, and another 100,000 former political prisoners and their families
are expected over the next two years.  <p>
Once all the Amerasians and political prisoners are dealth with, Vietnamese
will comne to the United States as immigrants, not as refugees. <p>
The United States and its consulate in Hong Kong have been charged in a class
action suit filed on behalf of 250 Vietnamese boat people who are trying to
join their families in the US. The US consulate in Hong Kong stopped processing
visas last fall that allow Vietnamese boat people to reunite with their
families; instead, the Vietnamese had to return to Vietnam and apply for
immigrant visas there.  The suit was filed in a Washington, DC court by Legal
Assistance for Vietnamese Asylum Seekers, a Virginia-based group.<p>
With the normalizing of relations between the United States and Vietnam, there
has been an increased number of Vietnamese abroad returning to Vietnam to
visit; the United Nations estimates that nearly 100,000 Vietnamese return to
visit every year, includiing 20,000 who are expected to return for the lunar
new year this month. <p>
Cambodia has recently seen an influx of Vietnamese to its country, and a senior
parliamentarian there has called for a halt. The Vietnamese Foreign Minister
said that there are fewer than 100,000 Vietnamese nationals living in Cambodia.
The Khmer Rouge claim that there are four million Vietnamese in Cambodia, and
that immigration is part of Vietnam's strategy to colonize its neighbor. The
issue is sensitive because Vietnam occupied Cambodia for a decade after
invading in 1978 to depose the Khmer Rouge. <p>

Expected to Reduce Foreign Worker Employment</a></a>
</a></h2>
Saudi Arabia's Fifth National Development Plan (1990-1995) had as a goal the
substitution of Saudi men and women for foreign workers throughout the economy.
The plan projected that 433,900 Saudis would enter the labor force, and that
there would be 213,500 new jobs created for them. The remaining 220,400 Saudis
were expected to replace foreign workers.<p>
A review of the effectiveness of Saudiisation found that public companies such
as Sabic and Saudi Aramco have most successfully integrated Saudis into their
ranks.  Private Saudi companies reportedly do not have management structures
that foster the integration of young Saudis into their firms, and some hire
only "token" Saudis to avoid compliance problems with the Saudiisation mandate.
However, some managers believe that Saudis are less qualified and demand higher
wages than foreign workers, making it hard to promote voluntary efforts to hire
more Saudis so long as foreign workers are readily available.<p>
Saudi Arabia is stepping up efforts to prevent labor recruiters from obtaining
work visas for workers for whom there are no jobs.  According to Saudi
officials, some labor recruiters obtain work visas for foreign workers who
arrive only to find there are no jobs for them.  These workers then turn to the
daily labor market, or become illegal peddlers.  The Saudis consider such
over-recruitment activities a security threat; foreign workers with such "free
visas" are subject to fine and imprisonment, and their Saudi sponsors must bear
the cost of their deportation. <p>

Cornelius argues that there is a structural dependence on migrant workers in
the US and Japan, as evidenced by the "need" for foreign workers in particular
industries and firms despite recession.  However, in recession, particular
groups of migrants become convenient scapegoats for unemployment and strained
public finances--Iranians in Japan, and Mexicans in the US.  <p>
Cornelius reviews how the debate over immigration's costs and benefits has been
transformed in California into the perception that immigrants generate all
costs and no benefits.  However, he observes that there are significant
benefits to particular firms that often extend to the areas in which those
firms are located; he recounts how an illegal alien interviewed by the police
in Japan discovered that the police knew exactly where he and his friends
lived, suggesting that the police tolerated their presence because they knew
about the local benefits of migrant workers.  The hypocrisy between
tough-sounding state and national demands to reassert control over borders
while permitting side and backdoor migration that is economically useful is
criticized. <p>
During the late 1970s, Cornelius was noted for his belief that most Mexican
migrant workers in the US were sojourners, not settlers.  He has changed his
mind.  The structural need for migrant labor means that, in his opinion,
foreign labor is inevitable, and government leaders should teach the public
that society must " accept as inevitable, a significant incidence of permanent
settlement among the foreigners whom it admits, through whatever channels." (p.

<a name="RTFToC2">Immigration
Reform Bills Flood Congress</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Senator Alan Simpson (R-Wyoming) introduced legislation to reduce illegal
immigration into the United States.  Key components of Simpson's reform package
include a counterfeit-resistant work identification card, further revisions to
the US system for considering requests for political asylum , and establishing
a fee on persons who cross the US-Mexican border, with the moneys collected to
beef-up border enforcement.  The maximum penalty for smuggling illegal aliens
into the US would be raised to imprisonment for 10 years, and  the death
penalty could be invoked if an immigrate dies as a result of coyote's
actions.<p>
<p>
Simpson's bill would also reduce the annual number of legal immigrants expected
from 675,000 to 500,000 for five years.  Simpson, one of the architects of 1986
immigration reforms, argues that because IRCA did not reduce illegal
immigration, the United States should now restrict legal immigration.
Simpson's bill would reduce the number of political refugees the US anticipates
resettling from  80,000 to 12,000 annually, unless Congress declares an
emergency. <p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the House Republican Task Force on Illegal Immigration has proposed
a $2 billion program that would lead to a tamper-proof Social Security card, a
$1.50 per person border crossing fee, and the elimination of all federal aid
for illegal immigrants. <p>
<p>
A coalition of nine California Democrats proposed its own package of
immigration reform legislation.  This proposal includes: increasing the Border
Patrol from 3,500 to 6,000 and upgrading its equipment and training; requiring
federal reimbursement of state and local costs of imprisoning undocumented
immigrants convicted of crimes;  tougher federal rules to protect US citizens
and legal immigrants from workplace discrimination; establishing a federal
review board to investigate civil rights abuses by federal agents; adding
resources to eliminate the backlog of aliens waiting to become naturalized US
citizens; and adding English and civics instruction classes for those seeking
to apply for U.S. citizenship.  FAIR, the Federation for American Immigration
Reform, has denounced this proposal, charging that it will increase government
bureaucracy and tie the hands of the government in enforcement. <p>
<p>
Finally, California Governor Pete Wilson (R) in a March 16, 1994 speech to the
Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC repeated his demand that the federal
government to reimburse states for the costs they incur to provide education
and medical services, as well as to incarcerate illegal immigrants. Wilson
argues that ''The Constitution of the United States is clear -- the regulation
of  immigration,  legal and illegal, is exclusively a federal responsibility.
And it's simply not fair for the federal government to force a state to bear
the costs of educating someone or providing emergency health care to someone
who is in the country because of federal failure to control the border.'' (p.
A4)<p>
<p>
In California, signatures are being collected to put two immigration control
initiatives on the November ballot.  The first initiative, sponsored by two
former Immigration and Naturalization Service officials, would prevent the US
non-citizen children of illegal immigrants from attending without charge public
schools and receiving taxpayer-funded health and welfare services; it has been
endorsed by the Republican Party.  This initiative also calls for stiffer
penalties for false ID cards and increased cooperation between government
agencies to enforce immigration laws.  <p>

<a name="RTFToC3">Immigration
Contributes to Inequality</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
President Clinton's first Economic Report of the President asserted that
growing income inequality in the US is "a threat to the social fabric."
Included in the list of factors responsible for growing economic disparities
are new technologies, diminished union strength, a falling real minimum wage,
and immigration.  Because "immigration has increased the relative supply of
less educated labor...[it]appears to have contributed to the increasing
inequality of income, but the effect has been small."(p120)<p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Eliminating
SSI for Immigrants</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
A White House Task Force is considering a proposal that would deny Supplemental
Security Income benefits to elderly legal immigrants unless they become US
citizens.  Illegal immigrants are not eligible for SSI benefits.  The SSI
program is a major source of support for needy elderly legal immigrants, since
many do not qualify for Social Security benefits because they did not work in
the United States. <p>
 <p>
The number of immigrants receiving SSI has increased from 128,000 in 1982 to
601,000 in 1993.  About 150,000 new applications for SSI are received from
legal aliens each year.  Two-thirds of the immigrant SSI recipients are
elderly, reflecting the tendency of some immigrants who have become US citizens
to bring their parents into the country, and then have their parents apply for
SSI.  The number of parents who immigrate to join their children in the US has
increased from 40,000 in 1985 to 65,000 in 1993.  By not permitting immigrants
to obtain SSI, AFDC and Food Stamp benefits until they become US
citizens--meaning they must wait at least 5 years--the  Task Force estimates
savings of over $1.2 billion per year. <p>

Quake Aid for Legal Immigrants</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Applicants for housing assistance in the wake of the January 1994 Southern
California earthquake will be spot checked by immigration officials to ensure
that illegal immigrants do not receive aid, in the first ever denial of
humanitarian aid on the basis of immigration status.  Initially the Federal
Emergency Management Agency wanted to rely solely on the honor system to
determine immigration status, but Congress insisted that applicants make a
formal declaration of their immigration status and show identity documents.
False statements carry penalties of imprisonment and fines.  <p>
<p>
However, the US House of Representatives defeated a measure by Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) that would have denied tuition-free federal
elementary and secondary education to illegal immigrant children. The House
rejected Rohrabacher's proposal that would have required public schools to
report the immigration status of students and their parents. <p>

<a name="RTFToC6">Canada
Revises Nanny Immigration</a> 
</a></h2>
<p>
On March 16, 1994, Canada reduced the requirements for immigrant nannies.
April 1992 rules required nannies to prove that they had completed at least a
six month training course before being admitted as nannies; the March 16, 1994
revision lowers the requirement to a 12th grade education and 12 months
experience as a maid.  After two years of work as a domestic, a foreign worker
may apply for permanent or landed immigrant status.<p>
<p>
Before the training requirement in 1991, some 7,835 domestic workers--mostly
Filipinos--were admitted.  In 1993, the number of Filipinos admitted dropped
from 5,323 to 779.  Since most domestics apply for immigrant status after
serving what some describe as a two year "jail term," the government felt
obliged to toughen the rules when it realized that there were over 1,200
unemployed domestics--mostly immigrants--in Toronto alone.<p>

Stricter border enforcement in California and Texas seems to have pushed

<a name="RTFToC8">Immigration
Costs in Texas and Florida</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Rice University economist Donald Huddle estimates that legal and illegal
immigration cost the state of Texas more that $4.68 billion in 1992, i.e.,
state and local governments incurred $4.68 billion more in costs than 1.9
million immigrants who arrived in the state since 1970 paid in taxes to state
and local governments.  According to Huddle, illegal immigrants cost Texas,
$1.02 billion,  legal immigrants $3.66 billion. <p>
<p>
Urban Institute demographer Jeff Passel re-examined Huddle's estimates and
found that, because Huddle does not include the taxes that accrue to
governments immigrants indirectly create job for Americans, and ignores the
taxes paid as immigrants purchase food and housing, he underestimates their tax
contributions.  The Urban Institute has received a White House grant to
estimate state costs associated with illegal immigration. <p>
<p>
In Florida, the Governor's Office and the Florida Advisory Council on
Intergovernmental Relations prepared a report, "The Unfair Burden,
Immigration's Impact on Florida."  It estimates that the state's 340,000
illegal immigrants cost the government $884 million a year for education,
housing and justice costs.  <p>

Smuggled to U.S. Via Thailand</a>

<p>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service reported that a major Chinese triad
is smuggling thousands of illegal aliens into the U.S. via Thailand.  The triad
provides Chinese immigrants with fake travel documents and housing in Thailand
before they are brought to the U.S. by air or sea. The U.S. government
estimates that as many as 80,000 Chinese immigrants passed through Bangkok on
their way to the U.S. last year.  Chinese who want to immigrate to the U.S. pay
up to $30,000 in cash or credit.<p>

to Wisconsin</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The effects of the immigration of Southeastern Asian refugees to Wausau,
Wisconsin is discussed in an article in the April 1994 Atlantic Monthly. The
community welcomed refugees in the 1970s, but now blames them for many of the
social ills that plague the city, including such as school busing and gang
violence. <p>
<p>
The fact that the refugees are poor and minority has aggravated tensions.
Seventy percent of them, primarily members of the Hmong mountain hill tribes,
are still receiving public assistance, and their children are almost a quarter
of the elementary schoolchildren. <p>
<p>
The refugees were brought to Wausau by area churches in the 1970s.  The first
refugees settled, and then invited their extended family members to join them
in Wisconsin. <p>

<a name="RTFToC11">Temporary
Foreign Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
An appellate court ruling will make it easier for employers to hire an alien if
no Americans are qualified or available for the job. The court eliminated a US
Department of Labor rule that required employers to repeat the application
procedure if one foreign worker is replaced by another. <p>
<p>
In New England, the US Department of Labor warned apple growers that the job
order they planned to file to search for American workers before being given
permission to recruit H-2A foreign workers for the 1994 harvest may violate US
civil rights laws because they state that the growers prefer " male workers
aged 22-40" who are "free from physical impairments ...which would make the
individual unable to meet quality or quantity standards."  In addition, the job
order states that workers willing to work six days per week are preferred, as
well as those that have experience working on "mainland" US farms and without
relatives in New England. <p>
<p>
The New England Apple Council Inc. in 1993 recruited 400 US workers, and 2,000
H-2A foreign workers to pick apples.  The Farmworker Justice Fund Inc. attacked
the Council's job description, calling it "blatantly illegal " because, inter
alia, the growers provided no evidence that hearing-impaired workers are unable
to pick apples, or that workers under 22 or over 40 should be discouraged from
applying.<p>
<p>
In New York, an apple grower paid $10,000 to 10 US citizen workers to settle a
complaint brought under IRCA in which the workers charged that they were fired
to make room for H-2A workers.  <p>

A hunger strike by about one-half of the 200 asylum seekers at the Campsfield

There have also been complaints about detention centers in France and Spain.

the country, but the German Ministeries of Interior and the Federal States,
which jointly determine when to deport aliesn, have agreed on the
postponement.<p>
<p>
The first deportations of 60,000 rejected asylum seekers from Serbia,
Montenegro and Kosovo were also postponed due to a breakdown in negotiations
with Romania.  In March, 640 such persons were to be flown to Romania and then
bussed to Serbia. <p>
<p>
The High Administrative Court in Schleswig, Germany ruled that Albanians from
Kosovo are entitled to asylum in Germany due to "collective persecution by the
Serbs."  Ninety percent of the people in Kosovo are Albanian, although all are
legally Serbian citizens. The administrative courts of the States of North
Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg are denying asylum to Albanians
from Kosovo, ruling that they are not being persecuted for ethnic reasons. This
example demonstrates that, in Germany, individual states have control over the
rules governing who is granted asylum. <p>

In a related development, Switzerland will on July 1, 1994 introduce new
legislation that allows the imprisonment of aliens for up to 9 months if they

The Chinese agriculture minister reported that in 1993 the average rural income
was 921 yuan ($77) versus 2337 yuan ($195) in urban areas.  Urban incomes rose
by 10.2 percent in 1993, versus 3.2 percent  in rural areas.  <p>
<p>
One result is that 50 million peasants migrated to urban areas in 1993, with 20
million migrating to the booming southeastern provinces.  There are now 430
million peasants, including 112 million who work in rural factories.  As men
migrate from rural areas, women are left to do the farmwork--145 million women
are now 70 percent of China's farm workforce, and they are expected to be over
three-fourths of the 240 million farm workforce in 2000.  Many rural women are
less mobile than men, and they are paid on average 22 percent less than rural
men.<p>

<a name="RTFToC21">Hong
Kong and the Migration Transition</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Cornell Economist Gary Fields in 1993 wrote an influential paper which argued
that both the rate and the distribution of economic growth influence a
country's migration transition from labor exporter to importer.  Asian nations
that attracted foreign investment to build factories from which labor-intensive
goods could be exported, he argued, initially created jobs at then prevailing
low wages,  but soon reached full employment, which permitted manufacturing
wages to rise.  <p>
<p>
In the virtuous circle that characterized Asian NIE development, these
manufacturing wage gains were shared with rural workers.  Manufacturing wages
in Taiwan, for example,  were only 20 percent higher than agricultural wages in
the 1970s, versus 100 percent higher in Mexico.<p>
<p>
Field's analysis suggests that the migration transition can be speeded up with
urban-led economic, job, and wage growth that is broadly shared throughout a
developing society.  Integrated and flexible labor markets are, in his view, as
important as growth and job creation per se in affecting migration.<p>
<p>
Ron Skeldon, a University of Hong Kong geographer<b>,</b> showed that Hong
Kong's experience is almost exactly the opposite of what would have been
expected on the basis of Field's analysis.  Hong Kong experienced significant
immigration despite unemployment in the 1950s.  In 1960, for example, the
number of street peddlers or hawkers--one measure of unemployment--was 50,000,
or equivalent to one-fourth of the manufacturing workforce.  <p>
<p>
During the 1970s, despite jobs and higher wages in Hong Kong, emigration rose,
peaking at over 25,000 in 1973, largely because Canada did not start to
restrict access until 1977.  However, emigration reached its highest ever
levels in 1990, when over 62,000 largely professional residents left.  At the
same time, real wages were rising in Hong Kong, and employers there complained
of labor shortages across the skill spectrum from maids to construction workers
to accountants.<p>
<p>
Skeldon concluded that the Hong Kong migration transition demonstrates that
economic factors such as jobs and wages are just one reason for migration.
Indeed, he notes that many of today's emigrants may actually be binational
commuters.  Some have an immigrant status in Canada, but spend much of their
working time in Hong Kong that they are referred to as "astronauts" because of
the amount of time they spend in the air.   Skeldon concludes that the Hong
Kong experience demonstrates dramatically the importance of policy and
political factors in explaining migration patterns.<p>
<p>
Hong Kong has been dealing with labor shortages in several ways.  Most
important is the relocation of low-wage manufacturing jobs to nearby Guandong,
China.  According to Skeldon, Hong Kong-based manufacturers have three million
employees there, or four to five times their Hong Kong workforces.  Guandong,
in turn, is attracting migrants from other parts of China:  almost two-thirds
of the one million residents of the city of Shenzhen in Guangdong in 1990 were
immigrants who had arrived within the past 12 months or had their registration
elsewhere in China.  In this way, internal migration within China has in part
substituted for labor migration to Hong Kong.<p>
<p>
Hong Kong also has several programs under which 80,000 to 90,000 immigrants
arrive each year.  About one-third are relatives from China who are joining
family members in Hong Kong--an average 105 Chinese daily are permitted to
settle in Hong Kong.  Another 10,000 to 12,000 are PTK migrant workers.
Finally, the Hong Kong government announced a program to admit up to 25,000
temporary workers for up to six years on renewable two-year work permits, plus
5,500 migrant construction workers.<p>
<p>
Hong Kong has announced a plan to recruit 1,000 mainland Chinese to fill
professional and managerial vacancies in Hong Kong.  Graduates of 36 mainland
universities will be eligible to take jobs in Hong Kong, and a ballot system
will be used to allocate them to Hong Kong employers.   They will be issued a
one-year visas, renewable for first two years, then another two years, and
finally three years.  Their dependents will not be permitted to join them in
Hong Kong. <p>

Thailand has more than 500,000 illegal immigrants, described by the Thai
government as foreign workers and gangsters.  Most (300,000) are believed to be
from Myanmar (Burma), China (100,000), and South Asia (50,000).  Most of the
immigrants from Myanmar are unskilled construction workers, who are hired
because they are willing to accept low wages.  The Cambodians generally work in
rice paddies, and the Laotians find domestic and factory work. There are also
immigrants from the Indian sub-continent and Middle East who enter Thailand
legally, and then overstay their visas. <p>

Immigration Crackdown</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Philippine government has ordered a crackdown on the estimated 100,000
foreigners who have been living illegally in the country for more than three
years--there is a reward of 2,000 pesos for every illegal immigrant turned in.
Most are Chinese and Indian nationals. The Manila Chronicle estimates that
there are about 500,000 illegal immigrants in the country. <p>
<p>
The government is also firing corrupt employees in the immigration bureau.  It
is believed that many foreigners were overstaying their visas because of
connivance of some bureau officials and employees. <p>
<p>
Indians in the Philippines have complained that the crackdown has permitted
Immigration authorities to extort money from them.  Current Philippine
immigration laws reportedly permit an Indian to obtain legal immigrant status
for 3,500 pesos. There are about 20,000 Indians in the Philippines, most of
them Sindhis who left after the British partitioned India. There is also a
large Sikh community, m any of whom have traditionally been rural
money-lenders. <p>

<a name="RTFToC24">Malaysia:
 A Special Report</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Malaysian government estimated that 50,000 mostly illegal Indonesians left
the country during the March 14-15 Hari Raya festival that marks the end of
Ramadan.  According to Deputy Home Minister Megat Junid, the federal police
crackdown known as Ops Nyah II was largely responsible for these "voluntary"
exits.  Under Ops Nyah II, the Immigration Department arrested 54,155 illegal
aliens between July 1992 and December 1993. <p>
<p>
According to Malaysian authorities, most of the illegal aliens in the country
are foreigners who pay bogus job agencies in their home countries for what the
worker may believe to be a valid work permit and job.  The mostly Indonesian
and Filipino workers are then brought into the country illegally, and issued
false work permits--the cost of illegally crossing the 20 mile Strait of
Malacca that separate Indonesian Sumatra from Peninsular Malaysia is reportedly
less than US$10.<p>
<p>
Many Malaysian employers of foreign workers are labor contractors in the
plantation and construction sectors.  They argue that some of the foreign
workers arrested by Malaysian police during worksite raids are in fact legal
workers, and that only a slow government bureaucracy--it can take six to eight
months from the time an employer applies for foreign workers until they
arrive-- makes the workers only technically illegal.  They note that Malaysian
employers were certified to need 425,000 foreign workers between July 1, 1992
and December 31, 1993, but that only 190,000 work permits were actually
issued.<p>
<p>
In January 1994, Malaysia announced a freeze on the further admission of
unskilled and semi-skilled immigrant workers.  However, Malaysia has continued
to permit employers to hire illegal alien workers who were in the country
before the freeze was announced.  Malaysian employers whose need for foreign
workers has been certified are allowed to hire the 4,866 illegal aliens in who
were being held in eight detention centers in February, 1994.<p>
<p>
Malaysia is engaged in a debate over how to control illegal immigration into
one of Asia's fastest-growing economies that is already at full employment.
Malaysia already has an employer sanctions law, but enforcement authorities
have admitted that there goal is to "punish illegal workers, not Malaysian
employers." Many Malaysian employers reportedly believe the labor agents, who
bring most of the foreign workers into the country, when they are told that the
workers are legal, and the agent is simply keeping their work permits for
safekeeping.<p>
<p>
 There are apparently few fines levied against employers who hire illegal
aliens, although in April 1994, the Malaysian Parliament is expected to approve
amendments to the sanctions law that would increase fines on employers who hire
illegal immigrants from M$5,000 (US $2500) to M$50,000 (US $2500), and permit
them to be caned, as in Singapore. <p>
<p>
<i>Background  </i><p>
<i></i>Malaysia is a fast-growing country of 19 million in southeast Asia that
ranks among the world's top immigration destinations.  However, Malaysia is
unique because it is a significant exporter and importer of unskilled migrant
workers.  Estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in Malaysia range from
200,000 to two million, and center on 1.2 million, while over 100,000
Malaysians work in Singapore, Taiwan, and Japan.  <p>
<p>
The Malaysian government's policies toward immigration and emigration have
changed significantly in recent years.  The 1968 Employment Restrictions Act,
which required Malaysian employers to get work permits for non-citizen workers,
resulted in thousands of Indian and Chinese plantation workers being forced to
leave the country.  However, as manufacturing employment expanded in the 1980s,
the gap between real wages in agriculture and manufacturing widened from one to
two in 1967 to one to three in 1981.<p>
<p>
Plantation owners complained of labor shortages--40 percent claimed that they
lost rubber and palm oil production in the early 1980s because of insufficient
labor.  The government "tolerated" the growing number of illegal alien workers
on plantations, and permitted contractors to use foreign workers to clear land
for resettlement programs on which native Malays (Bumipatra) were to be
resettled after foreign workers had prepared rubber and palm oil estates for
them.  <p>
<p>
The number of illegal aliens rose to "crisis" proportions in the mid-1980s.
The Malaysian government responded by stepping up border and interior
enforcement, and making agreements in 1984-5 with Indonesia and the
Philippines, Thailand, Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan to recruit legal foreign
workers in the event of labor shortages.  <p>
 <p>
<i>Current Programs</i><p>
<i></i>Under the government's current foreign worker program, employers try to
recruit Malaysian workers by advertising for them and working with local
Employment Service offices to find local workers.  If local workers are not
available, the Ministry of Human Resources certifies the employer's need for
foreign workers, and "Registered Agents" or labor contractors provide the names
of the Indonesians or Bangladeshis who will be brought to Malaysia.   <p>
<p>
Foreign workers receive one-year work permits, which can be renewed. They are
required to obtain Immigration Department approval to change jobs or employers.
The penalty for violating these regulations is a maximum fine of $M 10,000
(US$2500), or five years imprisonment, or both.  In 1993, 8,893 foreigners were
detained for violating the terms of their visas and 4,925 were deported after
serving their sentences.<p>
<p>
Malaysia may imitate neighboring Singapore and refine the levy system it now
uses to discourage reliance on foreign workers--Malaysian employers must in
most cases pay $RM 420 per year--by adding sector-by-sector limits on foreign
workers.  In response to a question, Singapore Labour Minister Lee Boon Yang
noted that the 200,000 foreign workers in Singapore are 12 percent of the
workforce of 1.6 million, and that Singapore is unlikely to be able to
completely phase out  foreign workers because of the slower indigenous
workforce growth and the rapidly aging population.  <p>
<p>
Singapore regulates foreign worker employment with an annual levy--highest for
unskilled workers--and per firm ceilings that vary from industry to industry.
However, employers can have the levy rebated on foreign trainees--the lower of
100 foreigners or 10 percent of a company's workforce-- who are in the country
for up to six months. Singapore has 65,000 foreign maids, and is debating
measures--including random inspections-- to protect them from abuse.<p>

After the June deadline, all illegal aliens will be deported.  In 1985, Nigeria

<p>
This bulletin, issued in May and November, is produced with the support of the

this issue, which reached California in March, 1994, include:  in October,1993
there were an estimated five million refugees and displaced persons in the

the five million were in Bosnia.  The number of asylum applicants expected in
Europe in 1993 was projected to fall by 50,000 to 100,000 below the 1992 level
of 821,000.<p>
<p>
There are new "transit migrations" into the Czech Republic (36,071 persons were
detained during the first 10 months of 1993), Hungary, and Poland(15,248
persons were detained during the first 9 months of 1993) of persons attempting
entry into Western Europe.  The French Parliament on August 24, 1993 adopted a

French nationals and resident foreigners can join them in France.  For example,
a foreign spouse of a French national must now live in France for one year
before being able to acquire an independent residence permit.<p>

Review.  The issue will include articles devoted to immigration issues in
France by Hollifield and two French Ministers who have opposing views on what
France should do about immigration:  Simone Veil, Social Affairs, and Charles
Pasqua, Interior.<p>
<p>
Hollifield's paper surveys the migration debate in Western Europe and makes
comparisons with the US debate.  Hollifield notes that demand-pull labor
recruitment and de colonization started most of the migrations into northern
Europe in the 1950s and 1960s, and then networks permitted supply-push poverty
and joblessness in emigration countries to maintain migration's momentum.  In
the 1980s and 1990s, this was manifested as asylum and refugee migration.<p>
<p>
Hollifield reviews political responses to anti-immigration opinion, policy
changes, and the search for and evolution of national and international models
to manage migration.  In fairly detailed country studies, Hollifield shows that
ruling governments have taken what have proven to be largely symbolic steps to
diffuse anti-immigrant sentiment without really slowing the influx of
immigrants.  The internal dynamics of migration networks evolve, as do labor
markets and firm employment practices in industrial countries, so that
migration takes on a life of its own.<p>

Dominque Schnapper, writes on "Migrants and Foreigners in France" in Vol 2 No 1
of People and Place, a quarterly publication of the Australian Forum for
Population Studies.  According to Schnapper, there were 3.6 million foreigners
recorded in the 1990 census, up slightly from 3.5 million in 1982.  This
obscures the fact that there were about 100,000 immigrants in both 1990 and
1991; the net increase in the foreign population is low because almost as many
acquired French citizenship each year. <p>

<a name="RTFToC2">States
Sue Federal Government</a>

<b></b><p>
<b></b>California Governor Pete Wilson sued the federal government on April 29,
1994 for reimbursement of $377 million that the state will spend this year on
the 17,000 illegal aliens held in state correctional facilities.  On April 23,
President Clinton attempted to head off such suits by asking Congress to
allocate $350 million to reimburse states for the expenses they incur to jail
undocumented aliens; if the crime bill passes, and the funds are appropriated,
$200 million would go to California.  In an effort to keep the limelight on
illegal immigration, Wilson on April 29 ordered 127 members of the California
National Guard to go to the US-Mexican border to assist the Border Patrol in
its efforts to prevent illegal immigration.  <p>
<p>
On April 12, Florida sued the federal government for reimbursement of the $1.5
billion that the state has spent for the past two years on illegal aliens, and
for "prescriptive relief" from future costs.  The Florida cost estimate did not
include any revenues generated from illegal aliens.  Two years ago, New York
sued the federal government, claiming it should reimburse the state for the
costs of keeping illegal aliens in prison.  That lawsuit is still pending.
Since 1994 is an election year, the Clinton Administration is under pressure to
estimate more exactly the costs that states and cities incur to provide
services to illegal immigrants, and to provide some monetary relief.<p>

<a name="RTFToC3">Illegal
Immigration:  Numbers, Benefits, and Costs in California</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
California has been at the forefront of the debate over whether the federal
government should reimburse states for the costs they incur to serve illegal
immigrants.  Over 300 people attended an April 29, 1994 conference in
Sacramento, California to hear presentations on the number and the benefits and
costs of unauthorized immigrants.  <p>
<p>
There is far more consensus on the number of unauthorized immigrants than  on
their benefits and costs.  For example, the consensus is that there are about
1.6 million unauthorized immigrants in California. However, there is much less
consensus on how much these immigrants pay in taxes and cost in services, and
this uncertainty, combined with inabilityof experts to predict the future
trajectory of the illegal immigrants and the economy, means that there is
evidence on both sides of the central question: will the unauthorized
immigrants arriving today be a future benefit or burden?<p>
<p>
<u>Background</u><p>
<u></u>In January 1994, Governor Wilson estimated  that the state incurred $2.3
billion in unreimbursed costs to provide federally-mandated services to
unauthorized immigrants--$1.7 billion for education, $377 million for
corrections, and $300 million for health care costs.  The corrections and
health care cost estimates are based on counts of unauthorized aliens
incarcerated and served; the education cost estimate is based on the estimated
number of illegal aliens in the state.<p>
<p>
Wilson argues that, since the federal government has exclusive control over
immigration policy, the federal government should reimburse states for all of
the costs they incur to provide services to unauthorized immigrants, especially
those services, such as tuition-free education for school-age children, that
the federal government or courts require the states to provide.  Once the
principle of federal reimbursement is established, there remains the question
of how much the federal government should pay.<p>
<p>
There is near agreement on the cost of providing these services to unauthorized
immigrants and their children, e.g., incarcerating a prisoner in California
costs about $22,000 per year.  The number of illegal aliens is the critical
variable in determining how many illegal alien children there are and thus how
much federal reimbursement California can expect. [Some argue that only the
marginal cost of services for illegal aliens should be reimbursed, since there
would be, e.g., a criminal justice system even if there were no illegal aliens.
Marginal costs could be higher than average costs, if new schools or prisons
had to be built; or lower, if the aliens fill otherwise vacant slots]. <p>
<p>
<u>Numbers</u><p>
There was apparent consensus on four points:  1) the number of illegal aliens
in the US  today is about 3.8 million; 2) their number is increasing by about
300,000 annually; 3) the California share of the illegal alien population
decreased from 50 percent in the mid-1980s to about 43 percent; and, 4) the
Mexican share of US illegal aliens has decreased from 61 percent in the
mid-1980s to about 39 percent.  These data are from the INS paper cited
below.<p>
<p>
When Wilson's staff was preparing the budget in January 1994, they used an
"unofficial" estimate that there were four million unauthorized aliens in the
US, and 2.1 million in California.  Wilson requested a $2.3 billion federal
reimbursement, or roughly $1,000 per illegal alien in the state.<p>
<p>
There are several benchmark estimates of the illegal alien population in the
US.  Based on an analysis of Census data, it was estimated that there were 2.1
million illegal aliens in 1980.  This number then increased--by an average
388,000 annually--so that in early 1987, there were thought to be about 4.8
million illegal aliens in the US.  Three million of these illegal aliens
applied for legalization in 1987-88, including 1.6 million or 53 percent in
California.<p>
<p>
There is a now a rough consensus on what happened since 1987-88.  The Census
estimates that there were about 3. 5 million illegal aliens in the US in 1992,
including 1.2 to 1.7 million in California.  The INS, using a different
methodology, estimated that there were 3.4 million, including 1.4 million in
October 1992.   The California Department of Finance, estimated that there were
2.6 million unauthorized US residents in 1993, including 1.3 million in
California.<p>
<p>
The INS estimates that the number of illegal aliens in the US is increasing by
about 300,000 annually, and by 125,000 per year in California.  This clearly
suggests that IRCA failed to stem illegal immigration.  If the INS numbers are
projected to the year 2000, there would be 5.8 million illegal aliens in the
US, about the same as in early 1987.  California would have 2.4 million illegal
aliens at the start of the next century.<p>
<p>
These illegal aliens are concentrated in a few states and counties.  The Big
Six states--California (1.4 million illegal aliens in October 1992), New York
(449,000), Texas (357,000), Florida (322,000),  Illinois (176,000), and New
Jersey (116,000)--include 85 percent of the illegal aliens in the US.  In
California, Los Angeles county has almost two-thirds of the state's illegal
aliens.<p>
<p>
These data are suggestive rather than definitive.  One of uncertainties in
making illegal alien estimates is that very little is known about SAWs, the 1.1
million mostly young Mexican men who became US immigrants because they did at
least 90 days of farmwork as illegal aliens in 1985-86.  The massive fraud in
this program--perhaps two of three persons approved did not satisfy the
program's requirements--encouraged new streams of aliens to head north, and the
growth of the false documents industry and labor contracting has enabled
illegal aliens to continue to find US jobs.  What remains unclear is how fast
SAWs and the "new-new" immigrants arriving are bringing their families to the
US.<p>
<p>
<u>Immigration and California Politics</u><p>
According to polls, the top four issues for California voters are the economy,
crime, immigration and education.   The state lost 550,000 jobs, mostly in
high-tech industries, over the past 3.5 years--so that relatively high-income
Americans moved out of California as poor immigrants moved in.  (Due in part to
moneys flowing into California after the January 17 earthquake, 164,000 jobs
were added in the first quarter of 1994, heralding a possible recovery).  There
is general agreement that the state government has a limited ability to restart
the economy on its own, and most candidates have already endorsed the "three
strikes" initiative that mandates life in prison for a third felony conviction
to deal with crime.  <p>
<p>
This leaves immigration and education. In both cases, California hopes for
federal dollars that can stimulate an economic revival.   Other states with
large illegal immigrant populations are feeling the same pressures.  A poll in
September 1993 found that 63 percent of New Yorkers (New York has 13 percent of
the US  population of illegal aliens),  want immigration reduced, but leading
politicians in the state are not discussing the issue.  Florida, with 10
percent of the US illegal alien population, sued for federal reimbursement, but
politicians there are not engaged in anti-immigrant political rhetoric, perhaps
because Cuban-American immigrants there vote.<p>
<p>
Wilson's request for federal reimbursement is supported by both Democrats and
Republicans in the State Legislature, although California commentators note
that:  1) some Democrats in the Legislature are "silent partners" in the sense
that they want federal reimbursement, but abhor the anti-immigrant rhetoric
unleashed by Wilson; and,  2) the state's 54-member Congressional delegation is
sharply divided over what to do about illegal immigration.  It includes some of
the most vehement open- and closed- border Congressional representatives.
Middle-of-the-road Democrats such as Senator Feinstein has been quoted as
saying that, "the day when America could be the welfare system for Mexico is
gone." <p>
<p>
With budget deficits looming, California voters are unwilling to approve tax
increases and the Legislature is unwilling to cut programs, federal
reimbursement seems like the easiest way to close the state's budget deficit.
California wants at least $1 billion of the $2.3 billion it is requesting, but
others are quick to point out that the California politicians demanding
reimbursement played leading roles in the immigration reforms that created
today's immigration dilemma.<p>
<p>
<u>Benefits and Costs</u><p>
There is a great deal of disagreement over the costs and benefits of immigrants
to the US and California.  Studies in the early 1980s in Texas and New York
concluded that the taxes paid by immigrants exceeded the cost of providing
public services to them, but that the federal government got the surplus of
taxes over expenditures, and local governments had deficits.  Los Angeles did a
study in 1992 that reinforced this conclusion.<p>
<p>
Donald Huddle of Rice University<b> </b>set the benchmark for today's debate
with a study that concluded that the legal and illegal immigrants who arrived
since 1970 cost the US $42.5 billion in 1992, and $18.1 billion in California.
According to Huddle, 7.2 million immigrants arrived legally and illegally in
California since 1970, and the state incurred costs of $23 billion to provide
them with services--half of the costs were for education and health care, and
one-sixth were due to the costs of providing services to US residents displaced
by these immigrants.<p>
<p>
As with all such studies, Huddle made assumptions about how many illegal aliens
there are, their usage of welfare and other public services, the taxes they
paid, and their indirect economic impacts.  Jeff Passel of the  Urban Institute
reviewed and revised Huddle's US estimates, and his calculations turned the $42
billion net <u>cost</u> into a $29 billion net <u>benefit</u>.  <p>
<p>
Most of the $70 billion difference between these studies arises from their
estimates of the taxes paid by immigrants--Huddle assumes that post-1970
immigrants paid $20 billion in taxes to all levels of government, and Passel
assumes they paid $70 billion.  And the major reason for the difference in tax
estimates is that Huddle did not include the 15 percent of each worker's
earnings that are paid in Social Security taxes, while Passel did--this
accounts for over one-third of the $70 billion difference.<p>
<p>
Huddle excluded Social Security taxes because, in his view, contributions today
need to be offset by the promise of benefit payments to immigrants when they
retire.  Passel included them  because the federal government treats Social
Security on a pay-as-you-go basis.<p>
<p>
<u>Next Steps</u><p>
<u></u>There was general agreement that "something" will be done about illegal
immigration in 1994, including some federal reimbursement to states and cities
to cover their cost of providing services to illegal aliens.  What is not clear
is whether federal action will stop with reimbursement of selected state and
local government costs, or whether the prospect of continuing illegal
immigration and continuing reimbursement will produce broader immigration
reforms.<p>
<p>
As Congress and the public re-debate what to do about illegal immigration, it
was noted that past "Grand Bargains"  between restrictionists and admissionists
have generally failed--the carrot and stick of sanctions and amnesty did not
stop illegal immigration.  Indeed, despite 200 years of experience with
immigration, the unanticipated consequences of US  immigration reforms continue
to have more lasting effects than their anticipated effects.<p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Jordan
on US Immigration Policy "Furor"</a>
</a></h2>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Former Texas Congresswoman Barbara Jordan termed the current US
discussion of efforts to halt illegal immigration and reimburse states for the
costs they incur to provide services to such immigrants a "furor" rather than a
debate.  Jordan was appointed by President Clinton to chair the nine-member
Commission on Immigration Reform (CIR), which is scheduled to issue and interim
report that includes recommendations to deal with these issues in September
1994.<p>
<p>
According to Jordan, the CIR agrees that control efforts such as Operation Hold
the Line--massing US Border Patrol agents on the border to deter illegal
entries--must be strengthened, since border controls are the most humane way to
deal with illegal immigrants.  Second, there is a consensus that illegal
immigrants should not be entitled to social service benefits such as welfare,
and an improved identification system should not be ruled out in order to
ensure that unauthorized aliens do not obtain such benefits.  Jordan  is
sympathetic to the pleas of states for federal reimbursement of the costs they
incur to provide services to illegal entrants, but she thinks that their
requests for federal payments may have overstated immigrant costs and
understated their tax payments.  <p>
<p>
Third, in response to proposals for a "moratorium" on immigration, Jordan said
she is not opposed to today's level of immigration.  According to Jordan, the
US can and should improve opportunities for all American residents, natives and
legal immigrants alike.<p>
<p>
There are 150 pieces of immigration control legislation are pending in either
the House or the Senate, and they propose, inter alia, ditches along the
Mexican border; a tripling of the number of Border Patrol agents; and creating
a tamper-proof identification card.  However, some observers predict that
immigration reform legislation will not be enacted in 1994 because there have
been few hearings scheduled on these proposals.  Sen. Edward Kennedy, chairman
of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs, is
reportedly afraid that <p>
holding hearings could lead to anti-immigrant legislation.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">UFW
 Marches in California</a>
</a></h2>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>United Farm Workers (UFW) supporters in April 1994 retraced the famous
1966 march that led to the union's first collective bargaining agreements.  In
a 335-mile trek from Delano to Sacramento, the UFW announced that it was
changing course, shifting its emphasis from urging consumers to boycott grapes
to organizing immigrant workers in California fields.<p>
<p>
The UFW was transformed by immigration.  The UFW won two 40 percent one-year
wage increases in the years that marked the era of low farmworker
immigration--in 1966, and again in 1980.  At its height in 1981, the UFW had
over 100 contracts, and 50,000 to 60,000 farmworkers worked under these
contracts during a typical year.  Today, the UFW has 20 to 30 contracts,
covering 5,000 to 6,000 workers. In areas such as the Salinas Valley south of
San Francisco, hourly wages are often lower today--$4.50 to $5.50--than they
were in the early 1980s--$5 to $7 (membership data are murky--some reports
speak of 100,000 members at peak and 15,000 today, but the UFW has never paid
dues to the AFL-CIO for so many members).<p>
<p>
Immigration and the rise of labor contractors contributed to the loss of UFW
contractors and members.  The UFW called several strikes in the early 1980s
that were broken by labor contractors who employed recently-arrived and
unauthorized workers.  The UFW hoped that, by legalizing farmworkers in
1987-88, it would win their loyalty, and that the expected end of illegal
immigration would enable the UFW to win wage increases.  Despite aggressive
efforts, the UFW and employer organizations assisted fewer than one in 12 SAW
applicants, and IRCA contributed to the increased immigration of illegal aliens
who found farm jobs with the help of labor contractors.<p>
<p>
The UFW continues to see growers, labor contractors, and what they believe to
be the pro-grower administration of California's farm labor law as the union's
chief obstacles, not illegal immigration.  Indeed, at a rally attended by
12,000 on April 24 in Sacramento to mark the end of the 23-day march, there
were more calls for another amnesty than for tightening border enforcement.
The march drew attention to the plight of California farmworkers, but put the
blame on growers and labor contractors rather than illegal immigration.<p>

state's population would reach 50 million by 2020.  In April 1994, Census

<a name="RTFToC7">Aristide
to Cancel US Return Policy</a>
</a></h2>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide notified the US
government that the agreement which allows Haitians sailing toward the US to be
intercepted and repatriated will be canceled in 6 months, i.e., on October 4,
1994.  Under the 13-year old agreement, Haiti allowed the US Coast Guard to
stop boats in Haitian and international waters to determine whether they were
carrying Haitians to the US; the US Coast Guard has intercepted and returned
66,000 Haitians since 1981.  <p>
<p>
Candidate Clinton criticized the US policy of intercepting and returning
Haitians sailing for the US during the 1992 campaign, but President Clinton
maintained the policy, saying he was saving Haitians from drowning at sea.  On
April 22, the Coast Guard brought 400 Haitian "boat people" to Florida, but
said that this was an "extraordinary circumstance," not a change in US policy.
In early April, the US Coast Guard, for the first time,  returned to the
Bahamas 19 Cuban &eacute;migr&eacute;s who were bound for the US.  Their return
came after the US was criticized over its handling of Haitians; previously,
most Cuban &eacute;migr&eacute;s were granted immediate political asylum. <p>
<p>
US policy toward Haitians came under attack in late April, as several US
Congressional representatives were arrested for protesting US policies.
According to US officials, US policies need only fine-tuning; some 55,000
Haitians inquired about US refugee status in Haiti, 15,000 applied and were
interviewed, and 3000 were recognized as US refugees and admitted to the
US.<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
A former US ambassador to Haiti noted that, by canceling the return agreement,
Aristide is trying to exert pressure on the US Administration.  If the
agreement is in fact canceled, Haitians might be arriving on Florida beaches
just as President Clinton is meeting with Western Hemisphere leaders in Miami
in December.<p>
<p>
Aristide was elected with 67 percent of the vote in 1990, but was ousted in a
military coup seven months later.  Aristide is currently touring the US asking
for grassroots support to reverse the policy of returning Haitians.
Unemployment in Haiti is estimated to be 70 percent.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC8">Living
With NAFTA</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Most of the US debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement in October
and November, 1993 centered on how free trade would affect American workers.
An April 8-9, 1994 conference at Yale University in New Haven, CT, turned the
spotlight on Mexico, asking how Mexicans are living with NAFTA after the two
C's in Mexico--Chiapas in January and Colosio in March 1994.<p>
<p>
When thousands of armed Indians took over several Chiapas cities in January
1994, they emphasized the fact that millions of  Mexicans, especially rural
residents, had been left behind in Mexico's recent growth spurt.  According to
those familiar with Chiapas, the 700,000 to one million non-Spanish-speaking
Indians in the Chiapas highlands became dependent on migrating to lowland
coffee-harvesting and corn-growing jobs in the 1970s--virtually all of the
120,000 adult men migrated seasonally to such jobs in the late 1970s.<p>
<p>
Cattle began to replace corn in Chiapas in the late 1970s, and many of the
Indians, displaced from migratory farm jobs, were employed in public works
projects after the 1979 run-up of oil prices.  But the debt crisis of 1982
ended these government jobs and, as Guatemalans poured into Chiapas to escape
fighting, Chiapas Indians lost coffee-picking jobs to them.  In 1989, coffee
prices fell by 50 percent, leaving a growing Indian population with ever-fewer
jobs and little hope.<p>
<p>
There was an upsurge of  conflict among the highland Indians which often
manifested itself as fights between Catholics and Protestants.  The cities
grew--San Cristobol's population rose from 30,000 in 1970 to over 100,000 in
1990.  According to some observers, it was no surprise that the Indians began a
violent protest; the surprise was that they tied the protest to NAFTA, and
showed considerable sophistication in dealing with the media.<p>
<p>
According to local observers, the Chiapas uprising has converted some
previously anti-NAFTA forces in southern Mexico into NAFTA supporters.  With no
future in corn or coffee growing, the Chiapas Indians need jobs.  Foreign
investment, spurred by NAFTA,  is likely to be the best way to get them.  <p>
<p>
There was considerable discussion of the Mexican government's treatment of the
Chiapas rebels.  According to human rights observers, there were three reasons
why the government did not use the heavy hand of the military to repress the
rebellion--there was a shrunken security presence in the area, almost 500
Mexican and national non-governmental organizations rushed into Chiapas, and
the international media arrived, so that military repression might have
threatened Mexico's image as a democracy open to foreign investors.  Human
rights observers expressed hope that the combination of the Chiapas uprising
and the March 23, 1994 assassination of PRI presidential candidate Colosio
would generate enough interest in the August 21, 1994 election that Mexican and
international pressures would lead to an honest election.<p>
<p>
According to several participants, Mexico has been pursuing its own version of
the "East Asian" development model--an authoritarian government that moves fast
on changing economic policies to produce rapid economic growth, but slow on
political changes that would promote democracy.  However, growth has recently
slowed--Mexico barely evaded a recession late in 1993, defined as two
consecutive quarters of a shrinking GDP--and the Mexican peso has slipped about
eight percent in 1994, to $US1=3.36 pesos in mid-April 1994.  <p>
<p>
Mexico's economy can be seen as a half-full or half-empty glass.  The Mexican
government expects Direct Foreign Investment (DFI) to increase by 24 percent in
1994 to $6.1 billion, from $4.6 billion in 1993.  But 85 percent of the foreign
investments in Mexico continue to pour into stocks and bonds; such funds can
exit the country quickly, as they have been doing in 1994 as a result of a 32
percent fall in the Bolsa (in US dollars). The Mexican government says that
$3.5 billion poured into stocks and bonds in the first quarter of 1994, while
one New York money manager estimates that $8 billion left Mexico.  <p>
<p>
Some experts express puzzlement at why DFI is not flowing into labor-intensive
manufacturing plants producing goods for export.  The explanations for the lack
of DFI range from uncertainty over the political situation until after the
August elections and September renegotiation of El Pacto--the government,
employer, and union agreement on wage increases--to Mexico's deficient
infrastructure. <p>
<p>
It is clear that at least some US and Canadian NAFTA opponents see the turmoil
in Mexico as vindication.  And there is no consensus on what may happen in
Mexico in 1994.  As one Mexican suggested, <u>anything</u> can happen in 1994.
There is a debate, for example, between those who want to reform the Mexican
union movement, so that it remains a key part of Mexican society, and some
"technocrats" and employers who prefer the largely non-union maquiladora model
that offers maximum labor market flexibility. (In Mexico, elections to
determine whether workers want to be represented by a union are sometimes not
by secret ballot, a practice that led to protests at a Sony plant in Nuevo
Laredo in April 1994.)  The foreign investors building plants in Mexico
allegedly want to hire young women who are just entering the workforce rather
than experienced (and perhaps unionized) workers who are losing their jobs in
downsizing and privatization.<p>
<p>
The first complaints under NAFTA's labor-side agreement were filed February 14
by two US unions on behalf of workers allegedly fired for union activities in
maquiladoras owned by Honeywell and GE.  Under the side agreement, there must
be a ruling on these complaints within 60 days, i.e., by April 14, 1994.
However, the tri-national labor commission, located in Dallas, is not yet fully
operational.<p>
<p>
Many Mexicans have used the two "C" events--Chiapas and Colosio-- to press the
government to help them.  In early April, thousands of people marched in Mexico
City to mark the anniversary of the death of revolutionary hero Emiliano
Zapata.  President Salinas distributed $10 million to farmers throughout
Mexico, and declared that the land reforms underway would "strengthen the
ejido."  Ernesto Zedillo, the new PRI presidential candidate, announced that
Mexico would not be able to maintain its economic progress unless democracy is
strengthened, a slogan that is to take concrete form in the establishment of
rules for the August 1994 election.<p>
<p>
The conference concluded on a question:  would NAFTA turn Mexico into a giant
maquiladora or into the high-tech economy that the Salinas technocrats want?
One somewhat surprising point of agreement was that virtually everyone in the
Mexican elite now supports NAFTA; the disagreement is over how to couple
economic change with political change.<p>

<a name="RTFToC9">Immigration
Fraud</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
A Hispanic civil rights leader was indicted on charges of running a $6 million
immigration fraud scheme that provided fake documents to illegal Asian and
Hispanic immigrants. <p>
<p>
Jose Velez, the president of the League of United Latin American Citizens
(LULAC) is alleged to have brought illegal immigrants to Las Vegas to file
false applications for amnesty under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control
Act Special Agricultural Worker (SAW) program. Velez and three Taiwanese
co-defendants are charged with conspiring to falsely claim in documents,
applications and statements to the Immigration and Naturalization Service that
their illegal clients qualified for amnesty because they did at least 90 days
of farmwork in 1985-86.  Velez's son and five others pleaded guilty on March
22, 1994 to helping to process 5,600 false applications for $5.7 million.
Individual aliens paid an average of $1,000 each for false documents (according
to the INS, the fees ranged from $250 to $3,500). <p>
<p>
The SAW program has been termed "the largest immigration fraud ever perpetrated
on the U.S. government."  This "easy" legalization program--created largely to
satisfy California growers that they would have a supply of labor after IRCA
made it unlawful to hire illegal aliens--was the last-minute compromise that
permitted IRCA to be enacted.  According to the best estimates, there should
have been fewer than 300,000 to 400,000 SAWs approved, but the INS approved 1.1
million, and set new streams of rural Mexicans and Central Americans heading
north.  As one result, already glutted farm labor markets got even more
workers,  farmers planted more apples and oranges, and labor contractors
emerged as "risk absorbers" to match unauthorized immigrant workers and
seasonal farm jobs. <p>

<a name="RTFToC11">France:
 Foreigners and Immigrants</a>
</a></h2>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>There are 3.6 million foreigners and 4.2 million immigrants in
France--immigrants include foreigners (69 percent) and persons born abroad who
acquire French citizenship (about 100,000 annually).  About 55 percent of the
immigrants in France in 1990 were from European nations.  Foreigners are
persons born abroad (79 percent) and those born in France of non-French
parents.<p>
<p>
France has a complicated procedure for granting "easy" citizenship.  According
to the jus sanguinis principle, a child of French citizen parents is
automatically French, as in most countries.  In addition, France as a special
type of jus soli--a child born in France with one French parent has a right to
French citizenship if he/she so chooses before age 18.  Children born in France
of non-French parents who have lived in France for at least 5 years can request
citizenship between the ages of 16 and 21.<p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b>The French right has often accused the government of understating
the number of immigrants.  There are 6.1 million residents of foreign origin,
including children with at least one non-French parent, and 20 percent of the
French population of 57 million has at least on foreign parent or
grandparent.<p>
<p>
<u>Immigration a Campaign Issue</u><p>
A campaign by the anti-Maastricht party, L'Autre Europe, is using the treaty's
promise of freedom of movement for citizens of non-EU nations who are permanent
immigrants in one EU nation as an argument against the EU.  L'Autre Europe says
that freedom of movement could lead to the  immigration of "socially and
politically unsustainable" e.g. Turks into France.<p>
<p>
<u>Pasqua Will Say No to Algerian Refugees</u> <p>
French Interior Minister, Charles Pasqua, said on April 18 that France would
refuse to accept any "wave" of refugees fleeing Algeria if Moslem
fundamentalists took power. According to Pasqua, the number of asylum requests
made to French authorities by Algerians rose from 104 in 1992 to over 1,000 in
1993. <p>

<a name="RTFToC12">Kohl
Calls for Expulsion of Violent Kurds</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called for the expulsion of Kurds who took part
in highway blockades and violent demonstrations on and after March 19 to
protest the Turkish government's treatment of Kurds in southeastern Turkey
(Kurds or "mountain Turks" are 10 to 15 million of Turkey's 60 million people).
Rudolf Scharping, the SPD candidate for Chancellor, backed the expulsion of
Kurds convicted of violent offenses. <p>
<p>
The German government is currently attempting to negotiate a deportation
agreement with Turkey.  The key sticking point is whether Kurds deported from
Germany to Turkey because of "threats to[German] public safety and order"  face
persecution there.  The German Interior Minister has asked Turkey to guarantee
that deported Kurds will not be tortured or executed. <p>
<p>
Kurds are one-fifth of the two million Turks in Germany, and an estimated one
percent of the 400,000 Kurds in Germany are members of the PKK, a group seeking
an independent country in southeastern Turkey, northeastern Iraq, and western
Iran for the region's 20 to 30 million Kurds.  The PKK was banned in Germany in
February, 1993.  <p>
<p>
<u>Asylum</u><p>
Germany is a reluctant land of immigration--most of the 6.5 million non-German
citizens in the country were not anticipated.  During the 1960s and early
1970s, Germany recruited "guestworkers" who were expected to work one or two
years and return home with their savings.  Instead, many Turkish guestworkers
settled. Originally imported to add only workers to the workforce, today the
Turks contribute proportionally fewer workers to the German workforce than do
Germans.<b> </b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>During the late 1980s, foreigners began to take advantage of Germany's
constitutional guarantee that "all persons suffering political persecution
shall have the right of asylum."  During the three- to five-year application
and appeal process, asylum seekers were housed and fed at local government
expense and, in some areas, they obtained permission to work. In 1992, over
430,000 foreigners applied for asylum--which fewer than five percent
received.<p>
<p>
Beginning July 1, 1993, Germany began refusing to accept applications from
persons who arrived via "safe" countries in which they could have applied for
asylum.  As a result, the number of asylum applications during the first
quarter of 1994 fell by two-thirds versus the first quarter of 1993, to an
average of 12,000 per month. About one-third of the first quarter's 36,000
asylum applicants were from the former Yugoslavia, and one-eighth were from
Turkey.<p>
<p>
<u>Unions on Integration</u><p>
A Confederation of German Trade Unions (DGB) position paper, adopted on
November 9, 1993, urges the German government to recognize that "Germany will
certainly need migrants" but that immigration must "be structured and
organized."  This can be achieved with annual quotas on immigration that do not
discriminate on the basis of, inter alia, country of origin and, once the
immigrants arrive in Germany, they must be integrated in a process that
involves mutual adaptation and respect.  <p>
<p>
The DGB has a number of specific suggestions for the immigration policy it
wants Germany to adopt.  For example, it wants permanent immigrant status
granted after five years of residence, and wants permanent immigrants to be
allowed to vote in local elections.  Foreign workers should be employed on an
equal basis with German workers, and this means, according to the unions, that
so-called contract work in construction must be banned.  Eastern European
contract workers are often brought to Germany as employees of a firm that wins
a subcontract to complete part of a construction project in Germany.<p>

million Russians have returned since 1991, but many complain that they are not

Workers Protest in Japan</a>

On March 14, 1994, 150 foreign workers held a rally in Tokyo to protest the
practice of some employers refusing to pay wages owed to foreign workers.  As
of November 1993, the Zentoitsu Workers Union, which represents workers in
manufacturing and construction, had 420 foreign worker members, and it created
a foreign worker section in 1992.<p>
<p>
As the Japanese unemployment rate has risen, to 2.9 percent in February 1994,
both foreign and Japanese workers fear layoffs.  Foreign workers cannot remain
in Japan if they are unemployed; when they are laid off, they are required to
leave.<p>
   <p>
Young  foreign professionals in Japan are satisfied with their jobs, but
pessimistic about their chances for advancement, according to a recent survey.
The Kaisha Society is a group of young foreign men who are usually hired as
shokutaku, or contract workers, rather than as seishain, or regular staff.
Many Japanese firms do not invest in training these foreigners because they do
not expect them to stay with the firm; just one percent of those surveyed
expect to be with their current employer in 10 years.  Most of these young
foreign professionals came to Japan because jobs were immediately available and
wages were high and rising in their country's currency.<p>

Evaluates Guestworkers</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Taiwanese Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has identified six major problems
associated with the foreign workers that have been brought into the country
over the past four and one-half years.  The CLA noted that foreign workers have
eased the labor shortage, accelerated the completion of major infrastructure
projects, and improved relations with emigration nations.  <p>
<p>
However, the CLA noted that there has been an inconsistent administration of
Taiwan's foreign worker polices, labor disputes between foreign workers and
their employers, and violations of rules by workers, labor brokers, and
employers.<p>
<p>
Since October 1989, the CLA has approved employer applications for 170,351
foreign workers.  Some 84,724--two-thirds of them Thais--are in Taiwan.
Foreign workers are admitted on one-year work permits, and may extend their
stay one more year.  Many of the foreign construction workers have two-year
work permits that expire in April 1994, and fears of labor shortages reportedly
led to the shift from two-to three-year maximum stays.  In March, Taiwan
announced that foreigners may not be more than 65 percent of the labor force on
major construction projects.<p>
<p>
In a related development, the Philippines announced in April that Taiwan labor
agents recruiting Filipino workers will need to be accredited by the Department
of Labor and Employment and have their commissions regulated.  Filipinos have
complained that these brokers fees can range from 38,000 to 65,000 pesos ($US
1,400 to $2,400), with the broker pocketing half or more of this commission.

On Palm Sunday (March 27, 1994), Malaysian authorities detained 1,200 Filipina
maids inside and outside St. John's Church in Kuala Lumpur.  The Philippines
complained that Christian maids were being harassed by Malaysia's
Muslim-majority government; only 21 of the maids proved to be illegal aliens
(38 according to Malaysian authorities). <p>
<p>
Some in the Philippines urged the government to protest this "roundup" by
suspending the migration of Filipino workers to labor-short Malaysia.  However,
Malaysian Deputy Home Minister Megat Junit Megat Ayub said that even though
Filipinos were preferred as migrant workers in the spirit of ASEAN cooperation
(and because they speak English), Malaysia could and would recruit foreign
workers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and China.  <p>
<p>
Malaysian authorities said that the purpose of the raid was to ensure that the
maids were not engaged in illegal activities during their Sunday day off.  More
than 10,000 illegal aliens have been detained since labor recruitment was
stopped and an effort was made to locate and expel illegal aliens in January
1994.  About 5000 remain in detention camps, and Malaysian employers who had
received approval to hire foreign workers before the freeze was announced can
hire aliens in detention.<p>
<p>
In the Philippines, economic growth rose to 2.3 percent in 1993, "largely
because of a 7.6 percent increase to $2.1 billion in remittances,"  making
remittances equivalent to almost 20 percent of Filipino exports of $11.3
billion.  The Philippines hopes that new power plants will eliminate brownouts

<a name="RTFToC25">Malaysia
Grapples with Labor Shortages</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Manpower Department's January 1994 Employment Trend report reviewed labor
market trends in 1993 and noted that employers were adopting a variety of
strategies to cope with labor shortages in an economy with a three percent
unemployment, including offering bounties to current workers who bring in new
workers, beginning to hire male production operatives, adjusting work hours
(such as adding a 5 to 11 PM shift), and raising fringe benefits more than
wages to make workers loyal to one employer.  Some 600,000 production workers
in manufacturing got wage increases that averaged 4.6 percent in 1993, down
from 8.7 percent in 1992, a decrease attributed to the availability of foreign
workers.<p>
<p>
The daily wages of production workers reached RM 9 to 14 ($3.30 to $5.20), and
fringe benefits add RM80 to 150 ($30 to $55) per month to average monthly
earnings of $102.  According to the report, industries offering
lower-than-average wages and unfavorable working conditions, including
agriculture and construction, face the most severe labor shortages.  The <u>Los
Angeles Times</u> reported that average daily labor costs were $6.50 in
Malaysia in 1993, versus $1.50 in neighboring Indonesia.<p>
<p>
According to government calculations, foreign investors have listened to
urgings to bring more capital-intensive projects to Malaysia.  In 1989, each RM
1 million in foreign investment created 14 new jobs, implying RM71,400 per
job($26,444).  By 1993, the ratio had fallen to seven, raising the investment
to RM143,000 per job($52,963).<p>
<p>
Foreign workers dominate the workforces of Malaysia's two eastern
semi-autonomous provinces, Sabah and Sarawak.  Daily wages in Sabah, which
reportedly ranged from  RM7 to RM12 for production workers, RM10 to RM20 for
construction workers, and RM7 to RM15 for agricultural workers, were kept
stable in 1993 by the ready availability of mostly illegal Filipino workers.
However, the Sabah state government nonetheless arranged for 1,688 workers to
move to Peninsular Malaysia to fill vacant jobs there. <p>
<p>
Most of the estimated 1.2 million foreign workers in Malaysia are Indonesians,
followed by Filipinos (335,000 are legal workers), Bangladeshis, and Thais.
The Indonesian Manpower Minister announced that Indonesia was going to
establish training centers to train workers seeking jobs in Malaysia,
ostensibly to help Malaysia to overcome its labor shortages.  Indonesia also
announced plans to step up efforts to prevent illegal migration to  Malaysia.

Australia--along with Canada and the US, is one of the three traditional
countries of immigration--is experiencing increased ethnic tensions which are
putting stress on the country's immigration program.  Firebombs  exploded at
Greek establishments in reprisal against the government's recognition of the
former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia (FYROM), one of the last of 58 countries
to do so. <p>
<p>
On April 11, 2,000 people demonstrated in Wollongong against the Australian
Federal Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs decision to refer to people
from the FYROM as Slav Macedonians.  Australia's publicly-funded ethnic
broadcasting service refused to use the name.  There are nearly 500,000
Australians from the former Yugoslavia. <p>
<p>
Australian MPs have called for those behind the violence to be returned to
Europe.  Others have renewed demands for stricter curbs on the country's
immigration policy. <p>

Recruits Guestworkers</a>
</a></h2>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>The Israeli government on April 10, 1994 announced that 18,000
additional work permits would be made available so that Israeli employers can
employ foreign workers  to replace Palestinians who were barred after April 7
from entering Israel.  There are 6,000 guestworkers from Thailand, Turkey,
Romania and other Eastern European countries in Israel, and permission to
recruit 7,000 more was granted in March 1994.  After all of these guestworkers
arrive, Israel will have 33,000 non-Palestinian foreign workers.<p>
<p>
There are two million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza (excluding
the 150,000 in East Jerusalem).  Earnings from jobs in Israel account for an
estimated one-third of the GDP of the West Bank and Gaza, so that it costs
Palestinians $4 million in lost wages each day they are barred from Israel.
Almost 80 percent of the Palestinians who work in Israel are employed in
construction and agriculture.  However, of the 107,000 unemployed Israeli
workers, only 1,400 have indicated a willingness to do farmwork.  <p>
<p>
Initial indications are that 15,000 of the additional foreign workers will be
for the construction sector, which claims to be short 60,000 workers, and 3,000
are for agriculture.  The Israeli government has tried to avoid having foreign
workers do Israel's "dirty work," and there is concern that substituting
non-Palestinians for Palestinians will aggravate frustration in the West Bank
and Gaza, where unemployment runs 54 percent.  Israelis seem to support
restrictions on Palestinians workers because of terrorist activities.<p>
<p>
When Israel began to restrict their entry in March 1993, there were about
100,000 Palestinians employed in Israel.<p>

and Labor Migration</a>
</a></h2>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>The Uruguay Round of trade negotiations that began in September 1986
ended on April 15 with the creation of a new organization, the World Trade
Organization, to regulate trade between nations.  France and the US led a drive
to insist that the WTO address the issue of "social dumping," the notion that
trade agreements should include clauses that require trading partners to
observe at least minimum worker rights if they want to export their goods.  <p>
<p>
Asian nations led the fight against the WTO taking up the worker rights issue.
They argued that the industrial countries wanted to drive up their labor costs,
thus making their exports less competitive.  When the industrial nations
insisted on linking trade and labor standards, Asian nations demanded that the
WTO also take up the relationship between trade and migration.<p>
<p>
The compromise was to include both the relationship between the trading system
and internationally recognized labor standards and the relationship between
immigration policies and international trade as "critical issues" to be
addressed by the WTO.<p>

CGES-CIIP Working Paper 1, Available for $5 from CGES at 254 Moses Hall, UCB,
Berkeley, CA 94720.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>This paper summarizes the facts about migration-for-employment, reviews
the reasons why people migrate for economic reasons, and outlines the research
agenda.<p>
<p>
There are about 100 million persons living and working outside their countries
of origin, they remit at least $75 billion annually to their countries of
origin, and the three factors that regulate economically-motivated migration
are evolving in ways that promise more rather than less in the 1990s.  Too
little is known about the relative importance of demand-pull, supply-push, and
network factors in particular migration flows, and how the relative importance
of each of these factors changes over time.<p>

Place of Migration.</u>  Available from International Labor Office, CH-1211
Geneva 22.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>This eight-chapter book explores an overlooked question:  could foreign
aid that was targeted and structured reduce the need for migrants to leave
their countries of citizenship as migrant workers and refugees?  The
International Labour Office and United Nations High Commission on Refugees
commissioned papers that were presented at a May 1992 conference, and this
volume is an edited selection of the papers presented.<p>
<p>
There are four ways in which rich industrial countries can affect
emigration-increasing pressures in developing nations:  trade policy, foreign
direct investment, promoting political freedom, and Official Development
Assistance (ODA).  Only ODA is directly under the control of donor governments,
and the major conclusion of the refugee papers is that the traditional two R's
of refugee assistance--relief and resettlement--must be expanded to four R's,
with the addition of repatriation and addressing the root causes.  <p>
<p>
Reducing economically-motivated emigration requires industrial countries to
shift from discussing trade <u>or</u> aid to trade <u>and</u> aid.  Industrial
countries are often hypocritical when they complain that their ODA is not
effective in reducing emigration pressures, even as they erect barriers to the
goods produced by emigration countries.<p>

Leon Bouvier and David Simcox published a study that finds that Asian
professionals born outside the United States have a higher median salary than
any US professional group. The highest median income is for South Korean-born
physicians who earn $101,000 annually, followed by Indian-born doctors at
$82,205. The study also found that although there were three times as many
black professionals as foreign-born Asian professionals, 14,000 Asian
professionals made more than $150,000 per year, while fewer than 4,000 blacks
did.<p>
<p>
The U.S. has 15.1 million native-born professionals and 1.3 million
foreign-born professionals, according to the 1990 Census.  If current trends
continue, a three-tiered professional labor market could develop, with Asians
having the highest earnings, whites in the middle, and Blacks and Hispanics the
lowest earnings. <p>
<p>
The Census Bureau has just released data on 110 racial and ethnic groups, and
they range in size from 30,085 Indonesians in 1990 to 45 million German-origin
residents.  More than half of the Egyptians, Iranians, Nigerians, Taiwanese,
and Pakistanis had at least college degrees.<p>

<b><u>Asian Migrant</u>'s January-March 1994 </b>issue is devoted to Filipino
workers in nearby Asian countries.  The Philippines is the world's

workers sent abroad legally in 1993 went to Asian nations, many as maids. <p>

<a name="RTFToC2">Clinton
Changes US Policy on Haitian Refugees</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On May 9, President Bill Clinton announced major changes in US policy
toward Haiti, reflecting increasing impatience with the failure of Haiti's
military leadership to restore democracy.  The president announced that the INS
would conduct asylum hearings for Haitian refugees intercepted at sea,
reversing the policy of returning Haitians and instructing them to submit their
applications for asylum in Haiti.  Clinton also announced the appointment of a
Haitian special envoy--William Gray, the head of the United Negro College Fund
and a former House majority whip.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Despite the change in policy, the INS has continued to return Haitians
leaving the country in small boats--over 1,300 boat people were returned to
Haiti in May after the change in policy was announced, while 2,000 Cubans and
Haitians have landed in Florida.  As in the past, the Cubans are released, and
the Haitians are sent to a detention center where they are screened.  Some
Florida politicians are calling for the INS to deputize local police so that,
in an immigration emergency, they could help to deal with a mass arrival of
Cubans or Haitians.<u></u></tt><p>
<tt><u></u></tt><p>
<tt><u></u>The US is discussing with nearby countries, including the Bahamas
and Belize, the possibility of setting up a temporary shelter for fleeing
Haitians.  The US does not want to house Haitian refugees at Guantanamo Bay in
Cuba, and it fears that cruise ships rented to house Haitian asylum seekers
while their cases are heard will soon be full.  <b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b></tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton said on May 19 that the possibility of a "massive
outflow" of Haitians is the most important of the six reasons why the US may
use force to restore democratically-elected president Aristide to power 32
months after his ouster by military forces.  On May 21, tough new UN economic
sanctions were imposed on Haiti.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC3">Immigration
and Campaign 94 in California</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Immigration continues to be a headline issue in California.  Governor Pete
Wilson, running for re-election, unveiled a television ad that shows Mexicans
running en masse through the San Diego port of entry.  Wilson accuses his major
Democratic rival of saying that illegal immigration is not a problem, while he
reminds viewers that he is suing the federal government for the costs incurred
by California to provide services to illegal aliens.  Ron Unz, who is
challenging Wilson for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, has adopted a
pro-immigrant and anti-welfare state position.  He argues that "anti-immigrant"
Blacks, union members, and environmentalists are Democratic party stalwarts,
and that Republicans should embrace immigration but reject bilingual education
and affirmative action.  The primary election--in which political parties
select their candidates--is June 7th. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The "Save Our State" initiative collected about 600,000 signatures--far
more than the 387,974 registered voters required-- to qualify an initiative for
the November 8th ballot.  If passed, the initiative would attempt to deny
public education, non-emergency public health care services and most other
social services to illegal aliens, and require state agencies to report any
illegal aliens they detect to the attorney general (some of these services must
be provided to illegal aliens according to federal laws or court orders).  A
Los Angeles Times poll of  1,471 registered voters questioned between May 21
and 25 found that respondents approve the initiative 59 percent to 32 percent.
A majority of Hispanics and Blacks polled oppose the measure, but whites favor
it 64 percent to 26 percent.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt> On May 28, Latinos throughout California rallied against the
"anti-immigrant hysteria" in this year's California election.  The protests
ranged from a march through of 8,000 or more in Los Angeles to picketing
Governor Wilson's reelection headquarters in Sacramento. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>California state legislators have decided to put off until after the
November election a possibly contentious debate about problems along the
California-Mexican border, especially the issue of providing free public
education to US citizen children who live in Mexico.  The issue was raised by a
videotape, made by the staff of freshman Assemblyman Jan Goldsmith, which
showed children crossing into the US from Mexico and boarding a bus for a US
school--the schools are eager to enroll these children, since they receive
payments for each pupil.  A bi-partisan task force will hold public hearings
after the November election on residency and border issues, including problems
with low-income housing and poverty in San Diego County.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The state's $55 billion budget, currently moving through the
Democratic-controlled Legislature for the 1994-95 fiscal year that begins on
July 1, includes $3 billion that the state is requesting the federal government
to reimburse for services provided to illegal aliens.  Even though there is
little hope that California will get (fully) reimbursed, and despite some
discomfort with Wilson's attacks on illegal immigration, Democratic legislators
have kept the hoped-for reimbursement in the budget so as "not to undercut the
Governor's request."</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt><u>Los Angeles Times</u> editorial writer Jack Miles reviewed Mexican
academic Jorge Castaneda's argument that California is becoming less democratic
because it includes an ever-increasing number of aliens ineligible to vote.
Castaneda argued, in an article published last year in <u>The California-Mexico
Collection</u>, that California should follow the example of the Scandinavian
countries and extend at least local voting rights to non-citizens.  Miles then
reviewed the Border Patrol's success in holding the line on the US-Mexican
border in West Texas--by moving Border Patrol agents from the interior to the
border, apprehensions of illegal aliens fell from 800 to 1,000 daily to 150.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Miles advances the proposal to link effective border control with another
legalization program in a repeat of the 1986 IRCA, which linked sanctions and
amnesty.  He considers this unlikely Grand Bargain better than the status quo.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A poll conducted last month by the Hospital Council of San Diego and
Imperial Counties found that two-thirds of the respondents thought that
hospitals should deny emergency care to illegal aliens.  Under current law,
hospitals are required to treat all emergency patients regardless of their
ability to pay or immigration status.  According to the Hospital Council,
border county hospitals get from $36 to $50 million in Medi-Cal payments to
cover the unreimbursed costs for emergency care for illegal immigrants. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Incomplete
Amnesty</a>
</a></h2>
<tt><i></i></tt><p>
<tt><i></i>The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 included two distinct
legalization programs:  one based on residence in the US before January 1, 1982
(LAW), and the other based on having done at least 90 days of farmwork in
1985-86 (SAW).  To the surprise of many observers, the number of SAWS was 1.1
million, or equivalent to two-thirds of the 1.7 million LAWS, even though it
was widely asserted that only 10 to 20 percent of all illegal aliens worked in
agriculture.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The SAW program was the last-minute compromise that enabled IRCA to be
enacted, but it has proven to have major flaws.  First, there was enormous
fraud in the SAW program--the best estimates are that as many as two out of
three people who were granted legal status did not in fact qualify, but
eligibility rules were written in a manner that required the US government to
prove that the alien was lying, rather than requiring the alien to convince the
government of his eligibility.  Second, the fraud in the SAW program encouraged
the expansion of the fraudulent documents industry, and farmers began to hire
more of their workers through labor contractors. Thus, enforcing labor and
immigration laws in a labor market that hires 1.5 to 2 million seasonal workers
each year--two-thirds of whom are immigrants--became more difficult.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>SAW left a third human dilemma--only workers were legalized, in the false
hope that they would leave their families in Mexico and commute legally to
seasonal US farm jobs.  Instead, many brought their families to the US,
producing mixed families, such as a family with a legal immigrant father (most
SAWS are young men), an illegal alien mother and several illegal children, a US
citizen baby, and perhaps a child protected by a "family fairness" provision
enacted in the 1990 IMMACT to prevent the breakup of families.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Illegal aliens who want the protection of "family fairness" must have
arrived illegally in the US before May 1988 and apply for protection from
deportation to the INS.  As of March 30, 1993, only 66,198 illegal aliens
applied for "family fairness" protection, and 56,495 received it.  However,
there are an increasing number of stories of children threatened with
deportation because they cannot satisfy the requirements to be protected under
"family fairness."  In a typical profile, a five year-old--born after May
1988--is threatened with deportation after her mother sneaked her into the US
because she cannot qualify for "family fairness."  Activists estimate that
there are 100,000 children in California who are illegal aliens and cannot
satisfy family fairness criteria to stay legally, prompting California
Assemblywoman Marguerite Archie-Hudson (D-LA) to introduce a resolution that
would ask the federal government to grant a Temporary Protected Status to all
of the illegal alien children in mixed families. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC5">Asian
Immigrant Poverty</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>More than 30 percent of the Southeast Asians in the US--versus eight
percent of all American residents-- are on welfare, the highest rate of welfare
participation of any ethnic group.  The seven million Asians in the US are
three percent of the US population.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In a study released by the Asian Pacific American Public Policy Institute,
Paul Ong of UCLA concluded that the economic status of Asian-Americans has a
barbell or hourglass shape--for every family with an income over $75,000, there
is another Asian-American family with an income of less than $10,000.  Over
one-third of all Asian-Americans 25 and older have a college degree or more,
while almost one-fourth do not have a high-school diploma.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>About 300,000 of the one million Southeast Asians in the US are on welfare;
they comprise about two percent of the US Aid to Families and Dependent
Children population of 15 million.  The first wave of Southeast Asian
refugees--urban and educated Vietnamese who arrived between 1975 and
1978--integrated fairly easily and successfully.  Later waves of Southeast
Asian refugees included more rural peasants--three-fourths of the adult
Southeast Asians on welfare in California have less than a high school
education.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Focus groups that ask people about health care reforms find that by
margins of 2-1 to 3-1, participants oppose providing tax-supported health care
benefits to non-US citizens.  A House Republican proposal to reform welfare
begins with "The Problem: Too Much Welfare For Too Many Immigrants," asserting
that 11 percent of all welfare recipients, and 20 percent of elderly on
welfare, are not US citizens.  The latest version of the Clinton welfare plan
would raise $3.3 billion of its $9.5 billion additional cost over five years by
reducing federal aid to non-US citizens.</tt><p>

local services was nearly $500 million, some of which was offset by sales and
other taxes and fees--other sources say that Texas will request $1
billion.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Unlike the California lawsuit filed last month, Texas Governor Ann Richards
went out of her way to describe the suit as a federal-state dispute over
unfunded federal mandates, not as an attack on illegal immigrants.  Richards
supports Operation Hold-the-Line, which has been able to reduce illegal entries
into El Paso by concentrating INS agents on the border.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Arizona joined the list of states suing the federal government by filing
suit in early May for the $121 million the state allegedly spends to imprison
illegal aliens.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>States view the requirement that they must provide services to illegal
aliens as unfunded federal mandates:  the federal government fails to stop
illegal aliens, but requires cities and states to provide services to them.  In
California, 40 percent of the babies born on Medicaid are born to illegal alien
mothers, and 17 percent of the state's prisoners are illegal aliens. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Most observers believe that these state suits will fail; California failed
to win the reimbursement it sought to care for illegal aliens in 1989-90.  A
major constitutional problem is that state suits to force the federal
government to pay certain costs in particular states run afoul of Congress's
prerogative to decide on federal spending.  A political problem is that over 80
percent of the immigrants are in just six states and, even within these state
Congressional delegations, there is disagreement over whether additional
federal funds should go to more enforcement or to reimburse state governments
for service costs.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Canadian
Immigration Targets for 1994</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Despite a 1993 poll that found that 47 percent of Canadians believe that
the country is accepting too many immigrants, and pressure from the Reform
Party to reduce immigration, Canada in February 1994 announced that it would
maintain the previous government's target of 250,000 immigrants and refugees in
1994.  Some 111,000 of these immigrants are in the family category, whose
sponsors must promise to support them for 10 years.  Another 86,700
non-sponsored immigrants are expected; they are selected on the basis of a
point system that gives preference to younger professionals.  Canada will also
admit up to  24,000 investor immigrants.  Canada announced that it was prepared
to admit 28,300 refugees in 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Reform Party wanted immigration reduced to 150,000 because of
persisting high unemployment.  The unemployment rate was 11 percent in April,
1994.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The number of persons applying for refugee status at Canadian borders fell
from 37,720 in 1992 to 20,492 in 1993, a decline attributed in part to a
February 1993 law that requires refugee applicants to be fingerprinted and to
pay a $360 fee.  Canada now stations immigration officers at airports overseas
who prevent aliens likely to request asylum in Canada from boarding planes that
would fly them there.  Airlines and shipping companies must pay a fine of
C$5000 for each illegal alien they bring into Canada.  Some provinces are
tightening refugee access to social services:  Ontario is ending health
services for refugees on June 1, 1994, expecting the federal government to
provide for them.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Immigration Minister Sergio Marchi has said his office will tighten
controls on entrepreneurial visas which give landed or permanent immigrant
status to aliens who invest at least US$181,000 in a Canadian business and
create one or more jobs for Canadians. Thousands of Hong Kong residents have
used entrepreneurial visas to emigrate to Canada.  The immigration minister
claims that many do not keep their part of the bargain by investing and
creating jobs.  In the first nine months of 1993, 28,217 immigrants arrived
from Hong Kong, about one-fifth of them with entrepreneurial visas. </tt><p>

practically no increase in population due to immigration for one of the few
years since 1940.  The immigrants are arriving from Mexico, Vietnam, the

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC13">European-American
Immigration Convergence?</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Will similarities in the nature of the twin problems of controlling
unwanted immigration and absorbing newcomers lead to a convergence of European
and American immigration and integration policies?  A conference of 70 leading
American and European researchers and policy makers in Charleston, South
Carolina on May 13-14 sponsored by the European Communities Studies Association
discussed the gap between immigration goals and realities on both sides of the
Atlantic, and worried about whether current steps taken to promote integration
will be successful.  They reached apparent consensus on three points: 1)
immigration pressures in Europe and the US are rising and are unlikely to soon
abate; 2) there is no compelling economic or demographic case for opening
borders now to mass migration; and 3) there are no clear historical or
contemporary models that provide beacons to guide integration policies.</tt><p>
<tt><b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>European Concerns</tt><p>
<tt>The 12-nation European Union in 1992 had a population of 347 million.  By
2025, the population of the EU-12 is projected to fall to 340 million.  There
were 14.2 million legally-present foreigners in EU countries in 1990, and 4.9
million or one-third of them were citizens of one EU nation living in another,
i.e. there are 9.3 million so-called third-country nationals in the EU, and
they represent less than three percent of the population. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>These data suggest that foreigners and immigration should not be major
concerns in Europe, yet immigration is a top political issue from the UK to
Italy.  There are several reasons.  First, many foreigners who reside in the EU
do not show up in these immigration data--those excluded include the one
million asylum seekers who arrived in EU nations since 1990, ethnic Germans
moving from Russia to Germany, and illegal aliens, estimated to number 2.5
million in 1990.  Even though massive east-to-west migration did not occur, as
some expected, the entry of one to two million newcomers annually forced the
member nations of the EU to take restrictive actions.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>European participants expressed conflicting opinions about whether there is
an immigration problem and what should be done about it.  For example, one
noted that the annual rate of immigration varies from over one percent in
Germany--one million newcomers arrived in 1992 in a country with a population
of 81 million--to 0.5 to 0.6 in the Benelux and Scandinavian countries, to 0.1
to 0.3 in southern Europe.  However, it was noted that concern about
immigration was not two to five times greater in Germany than elsewhere,
suggesting to a European observer that rates of immigration were about what
European countries wanted them to be.  Furthermore, it was argued that European
governments prefer that immigrants remain illegal--most European illegal aliens
arrive as legal tourists-- so that they fill seasonal and low wage jobs but are
less likely to become residents since they cannot easily gain access to public
housing or social services.  European governments, in this view, can try to
further tighten controls or tackle the root causes of emigration and integrate
those immigrants who do settle until emigration pressures diminish.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Other Europeans took the view that the perception of out-of-control
migration was dangerous because it allowed generally conservative parties to
appeal to voters with open or subtle anti-foreigner appeals.  In France,
Germany, and the UK, it was argued, conservative political parties played the
anti-immigrant card to gain votes, although when the political elite from all
parties agreed that immigration had gotten too hot to handle, they developed
compromises to "take immigration out of politics," as Germany reportedly did
with its asylum compromise in the fall of 1992.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Explaining the Gap</tt><p>
<tt>Several participants developed theories to explain why there is a gap
between generally restictionist immigration policy goals in Western Europe and
the US and the immigration reality of larger-than-anticipated
immigration--there is, it was said, nothing more practical than a good theory.
Most theories of why immigration control is difficult to achieve deal at least
in part with the liberal paradox--the notion that industrial democracies push
nations to embrace free trade and investment, and warn them that their failure
to open their borders to free trade will result in slower economic growth and
less World Bank and IMF funds.  On the other hand, industrial nations complain
that now open-developing economies are sending workers over industrial-country
borders. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The most interesting theory of why there is a gap between immigration
policy goals and outcomes was based on the behavior of three "actors" in
industrial countries:  individual voters, organized interest groups, and
government officials.  According to this theory, individual voters are
rationally ignorant about the true nature of the benefits and costs of a
phenomenon as complex as mass or unskilled immigration--labor migration,
whether legal or illegal, tends to produce immediate and fairly concentrated
benefits, while its costs are deferred and hard to measure.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In such a situation, effective immigration control is akin to a public good
that has no effective advocate.  Organized groups that benefit from mass
immigration, and the government actors who regulate immigration, can ignore
restrictionist public opinion, especially when the economy is booming.  This
gives immigration in the industrial democracies an expansionist flavor, since
it takes a long time to mobilize restrictionist public opinion.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This theory suggests that immigration will typically be higher than public
opinion would support, especially since elites in the traditional immigration
countries such as the US and Canada are pro-immigrant.  Furthermore, so long as
organized interest groups are able to re-label their immigration programs,
turning, for example, guestworker programs into seasonal and contract worker
programs, they can continue to have large numbers of immigrant workers
admitted.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Integration</tt><p>
<tt>There are many models of immigrant integration, and they have in common a
nostalgic sense that they worked in the past, but doubts that these same
integration models will work in the future.  The French "Republican" model,
which stressed public conformity to national values while tolerating private
expressions of religious and culture differences, American models from
"Americanization" to melting pot to salad bowl metaphors, and Scandinavian and
Dutch models of subsidizing and celebrating ethnic differences represent very
distinct integration models.  There was a great deal  of speculation about how
well these models are likely to work with the current wave of newcomers, but no
one seemed willing to assert that a particular model is "best" for any
particular EU country or for the US.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Cooperation and Convergence?</tt><p>
<tt>There are clearly new forces impinging on immigration policy making.  In
Europe, there is tension between the various EU bodies and national
governments, although its was stressed repeatedly that immigration remains the
domain of national governments, and talk of burden sharing is confined to
discussions of what to do about asylum seekers.  EU officials seem to embrace
the notion that cooperation in dealing with asylum applicants should also be
extended to other migration-related issues, from how to deal with the smuggling
of illegal aliens to providing aid that addresses the root causes of migration.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Rising migration pressure at a time when states' borders are becoming more
porous and public opinion in aging societies that are experiencing high
unemployment makes immigration a potentially explosive issue in industrial
democracies.  This conference provided a great deal of information on why it is
so hard to develop and implement effective immigration controls, but it
generated much less guidance for policymakers struggling to incrementally
adjust the doors so that the foreigners they want can easily enter, and the
foreigners they do not want are excluded. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC14">Increased
Anti-Immigrant Rhetoric in the Netherlands</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The recession, immigration and unemployment have begun to erode the
Netherlands tolerance for immigrants.  In March 1994  elections, the extreme
right Central Democrats won three seats, while the extreme left Socialist Party
gained two seats in the 150-member Lower House of Parliament.  The Liberals,
who propose barring the children of illegal immigrants from school, gained nine
seats, and now hold 31, while the D66 party, which preaches ethnic and
religious tolerance, doubled their seats to 24. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The increased number of asylum seekers in the Netherlands and an increase
in racial violence reportedly helped the anti-immigrant Central Democrats and
the Center Party to gain seats in the March election.  The Central Democrats
have promised to repatriate all asylum seekers unless they face the death
penalty or life imprisonment in their homeland. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>One Central Democrat member boasted during a television broadcast that he
set fire to immigrant hostels in the 1970s.  He was arrested for arson and
expelled from the party. Another Central Democrat local council member made
anti-Semitic remarks about migrant workers, prompting other council members to
call for prosecution for hate crimes.  A Dutch court found another far-right
member of Parliament guilty of making racist statements in 1989 and 1990 in
political party broadcasts and fined him $3,240.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Netherlands has tightened its border controls.  Immigration officials
are now stationed at the airports to identify those suspected of entering the
country and then illegally overstaying their tourist visas.  They are now
expelled immediately.  Airplanes take aerial photographs of suspected illegal
entrants crossing Dutch borders so that the Netherlands can prove that an
asylum seeker entered from Belgium or Germany and should be returned there to
apply for asylum.  Beginning June 1, the Dutch police will be able check the
identification papers of anyone . </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In 1993, there were 35,400 asylum seekers in the Netherlands, double the
1992 figure of 17,450, and requiring the expenditure of $500 million--about
$14,000 per applicant.  About half of the asylum applicants were granted safe
haven.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Dutch asylum procedures have been streamlined so that most cases can be
handled within 24 hours, and difficult cases can be decided in six months
instead of the seven years it previously took.  Beginning July 1, 1994, two
central registers will be created in the Netherlands to which all asylum
seekers, except those landing at Schiphol Airport, will have to submit their
asylum applications.  Since April 27, 1994, the Dutch government has been
detaining rejected asylum seekers until their deportation, and it estimates
that 4,000 asylum seekers will be detained this year.  The Dutch government is
preparing a list of "safe countries"--asylum applicants from these countries
have the burden of proving that they face persecution--that must include at
least all of the countries on Germany's list.  </tt><p>

Immigration: Rules Changed, Numbers Up</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The British Home Office presented to the Parliament new immigration rules
which will go into effect October 1, 1994.  The new rules eliminate references
to gender in immigration categories, creates a entrepreneurial business
category, tighten rules on private students and hospital patients to eliminate
abuse, and set up a new clearance system for vacationing youth from throughout
the Commonwealth who work in the UK to support themselves.  The new
"entrepreneurial investor" status will allow wealthy foreigners to live in the
UK for one year if they demonstrate that they have at least L1million (US $1.5
million) and agree to invest L750,000 (US$1.13 million) in UK government bonds,
stocks, or corporate bonds.  Investors must make Britain their main home and,
if they can maintain themselves without employment, their stay can be extended
for three years. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A Home Office report noted that in 1993, 55,000 people were granted
residence in the UK, up from 2,900 in 1992.  Over half of the immigrants were
from India, the Caribbean and former British colonies in Africa.  Nearly 44
percent were from non-Commonwealth countries and the remainder were from
Australia, New Zealand and Canada. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There were 22,400 asylum seekers in Britain (excluding dependent relatives
and children), five times the number who applied six years ago, but a drop of
2,200 from 1992.  Under public pressure, the British Home Office has decided to
end the use of Pentonville Prison to detain asylum seekers.  Asylum seekers at
the Campfield House near Oxford held a hunger strike in March to protest the
use of the prison to house asylum seekers.  A detention center run by the
Immigration Service will house asylum seekers in a wing of Rochester Prison in
Kent.  There are 637 asylum seekers being held in detention centers in Britain.

in Europe</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>From Sweden to Spain, European governments fearing that a wave of asylum
seekers threatens prosperity and social cohesion have tightened access to and
eligibility for asylum.  Critics of the crackdown on asylum complain that it
may result in genuine refugees being returned to face persecution, and that
closing the asylum door encourages illegal alien smuggling.  The number of
illegal aliens in Western Europe has been estimated to be 2.5 million, but that
may be too low--an airplane crash into an apartment building in Amsterdam in
October 1992 revealed that many of the victims were illegal aliens.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On April 12, the parliamentary committee of the Council of Europe in
Strasbourg urged the creation of a European Refugee Commission to coordinate
the asylum procedures of the member states, the appointment of a European High
Commissioner for Refugees to work with the UN Commissioner for Refugees, and
the establishment of a fund to assist countries with  large numbers of
refugees.  The Council also asked European countries to accept more refugees.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A European Union representative  requested that EU development funds be
appropriated to Albania, Bosnia and Croatia to help stem illegal immigration.
The proposal is supported by Greece and Germany--both have large numbers of
illegal immigrants fleeing from the poverty in Albania and the war in Croatia.
The issue was raised at an informal meeting of EU ministers May 6-7 in Greece.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>According to Europeans, the southern European nations of Greece, Italy,
Portugal, and Spain have already closed their doors to legal immigrants and
asylum seekers because illegal immigration is considered to be out of
control--the number of asylum seekers in these four countries fell from 89,278
in 1992--95 percent in Spain--to 41,675--90 percent in Spain.  </tt><p>

<tt>Asylum Seekers and Illegal Immigration<i></i></tt><p>
<tt><i></i>In April, a total of 12,164 people applied for asylum in Germany,
bringing the total to 47,986 for the first four months of 1994.<b>  </b>Over
14,000 were from Serbia and Montenegro, 6,500 from Turkey, 4,400 from Romania
and 2,800 from Bosnia-Hercegovina.  The German border police report that they
have stopped the recent increase in illegal entrants who arrive by air.  The
number of ethnic Germans<b> </b>arriving in Germany was 65,234, up slightly
from the first four months of 1993--they are considered German citizens upon
their arrival and are not counted in German immigration statistics.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stricter border controls have been in force since April 1st to prevent
asylum seekers from entering Germany by ferry.  The ferry companies in Norway,
Sweden and Finland must now check whether passengers have valid immigration
documents --the companies are liable for fines between DM 2,100 and DM 31,900
if they transport passengers without the proper permits.  In Hamburg, local
officials have been accused of selling residence permits for DM1,000 to DM3,000
each.</tt><p>

<tt>German employers are investing in factories just inside the Polish border
to take advantage of wages that are one-seventh those of the former East

<tt>In Magdeburg in the former east Germany, German youth drinking on Ascension
Day (May 12) beat up five Africans on a downtown street and then followed them
into the Turkish-owned cafe where they took refuge.  Several Turkish customers
stabbed four of the German youth, and for hours afterward Germans and
non-Germans attacked each other on the streets, leading Commissioner for Alien
Affairs Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen to assert that anti-foreigner violence had
hit a new "high point."  </tt><p>

racially-motivated crimes. They would increase jail sentences, utilize
preventative detention and punish those who deny the Nazi atrocities of World

<tt>Less than five percent of the major groups of foreigners in
Germany--including Turks, Croats, and Italians--become naturalized German
citizens.  Under current law, most foreigners must live in Germany for 15
years, and then renounce their allegiance to their native country, e.g. Turkish
citizenship to become a naturalized German citizen.  Commissioner for Alien
Affairs Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen in February 1994 introduced a package of
measures that would have made naturalization easier by permitting dual
citizenship and reduced from 15 to eight years the required period of residence
in Germany, but the Kohl government in March 1994 rejected her proposals.
Under current law, a Turk born in Germany must at age 16 apply for a work
permit.</tt><p>

<tt>The United Nations International Organization for Migration released a

East and Asia are migrating  through Central and Eastern European countries,
hoping to get visas to the West.  However, the tightening of immigration

the Czech Republic in 1993, mostly from Tunisia, China, Bulgaria, Romania and
the former Yugoslavia.  IOM's conservative estimate is that 100,000 "transit
migrants" entered Poland in 1993.  Many migrants from the former Soviet Union

<a name="RTFToC23">South
Korean Guestworkers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>South Korea has experienced one of the world's fastest migration
transitions:  in 1982, over 200,000 Korean workers emigrated, and in 1994, the
South Korean government is debating how to deal with the 20,000 foreign
"trainees" and 50,000 to 100,000 illegal aliens who arrived with tourist or
student visas.  Officials routinely announce that the country will need 100,000
foreign workers to overcome the labor shortages arising from rapid economic
growth (an average real 8.5 percent per year rate between 1985 and 1992),
affluence ($6,800 GNP per capita in 1992), and a slow growing population (the
44 million population increases by one percent annually).  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Under a plan scheduled to go into effect on June 1, 1994, South Korea will
crack down on illegal alien workers and permit the Korean Federation for Small
Business to import up to 20,000 foreign trainees for 4,200 small businesses.
They will be housed, fed, and paid $260 per month.  Initial quotas allocate
8,000 slots to China and 3,000 to the Philippines.  </tt><p>
<tt> </tt><p>
<tt>Alternatives</tt><p>
<tt>In a talk delivered to the Korean Federation for Small Business April 19,
1994, Roger Bohning of the International Labour Office argued that "undesired
jobs" are at the bottom of all firm, industry, and societal labor markets, and
that rapid economic and job growth and slow labor force growth gives rise to a
widening scissors labor shortage, as the demand for workers to fill undesired
jobs increases, while the supply of domestic workers willing to fill them
shrinks.  In Korea, Bohning notes, wages rise with the size of the firm in
manufacturing, and the wages of skilled workers are rising relative to
unskilled workers, leading to an acute labor shortage for small firms.  This
makes Korea different from Western Europe, where large firms experienced labor
shortages that were filled by guestworkers in the 1960s.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Bohning concludes that the current policy of admitting trainees and
tolerating illegal aliens is not sustainable--in part because the monthly wage
paid to trainees is less than usual illegal earnings.  He recommends that the
trainee system be abolished, that the employment of illegal aliens be deterred
by fining the employers who hire them, and that a legal guestworker system be
established after consultations with employer and worker representatives
(p21).</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Defector Bonuses </tt><p>
<tt>South Korea has changed its policy of offering cash to defectors from North
Korea because of an expected flight of refugees escaping the worsening North
Korean economy. Previously, defectors received $19,000 to $31,000 for
resettlement and a reward of gold for information or equipment from North
Korea.  Since the start of the program, about 100 North Koreans have defected
south.  One defector reportedly received $630,000 in government support in
1987. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>An ad-hoc committee will  examine possible ways to help the defectors
adjust to South Korea and live on their own.  Recent defectors have said food
shortages are forceing the North Korean government to loosen movement
restrictions to search for food and, as a result, some North Koreans are using
the opportunity to escape into neighboring China and South Korea.  Experts say
that 2,000 North Koreans are hiding in China, but that 80 percent of those who
flee there are returned to North Korea.  Thousands of North Koreans are working
in Siberia as contract loggers.  Analysts predict that conflict or a collapse
of the economy could force as many as two million North Koreans to seek refuge
in other countries </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>If North Korea's economy collapsed, analysts predict that 4.5 million
people would flee south, and that the cost of unification would exceed $1.2
trillion.  North Korea, with 23 million people, is about half as populous as
South Korea, with 44 million, but the North's GNP is believed to be less than
10 percent as large as South Korea's $300 billion GNP.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC24">China
Loosens Internal Migration Controls</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>China is planning to change its decades-old rules that restrict internal
migration.  The government will, as soon as June 1, 1994, relax rules which
currently prevent farmers from settling in cites.  No rural-urban influx is
expected: at most, it is predicted, several million peasants will apply for
permanent residence in the cities.  The reform of the registration system
(registration in an area is necessary to obtain housing and coupons for
rationed goods) will also regularize the status of the 20 to 30 million
peasants "illegally" living in cities. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 100 million internal migrants in China, a number
equivalent to the worldwide population of persons living outside their
countries of citizenship.  The Chinese registration system was coming under
strain because of the uneven economic boom in the country--the economy has been
grew in real terms by six percent annually between 1985 and 1992, but much of
the job growth was in the urban areas of southeastern China.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Internal Chinese migrants send remittances to their villages of origin:  50
billion yuan, or US$5.7 billion, by one estimate.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Under the revised registration system, internal migrant workers must carry
their ID card, work permit and single status or family planning certificate.
Many Chinese states have formal procedures through which migrant workers must
find jobs, including signing up with the local labor service office.  Through
this mechanism, Beijing feels it has effectively managed migration throughout
the country. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In October 1993, the Chinese Ministry of Labor published an urban and rural
employment coordination plan which called for organizing the rural labor exodus
through legitimate channels, for regional governments to formulate necessary
labor market rules and management systems to handle migrant workers, and to
improve services to migrant workers during their trans-regional travel.  The
Ministry hopes that the implementation of these measures will ensure an orderly
flow of labor throughout the country by 1996.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Internal Chinese migrants may look to emigrate.  Russia, Hong Kong, Taiwan,
Spain, Japan, Indonesia, among others, have expressed concern that
deteriorating conditions and internal migration within China could lead to a
mass exodus.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>China's Labor Ministry reported that it found jobs for only 1.2 million o f
the 5.4 million urban workers who were laid off in 1993. There are reportedly
100 million underemployed Chinese peasants. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The 47,000 foreign-funded firms operating in China are to have unions to
cover their six million Chinese workers within two years.  There have been
disputes over foreign "exploitation" of Chinese workers.</tt><p>

of 1997 Vary</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>With China preparing for its takeover of Hong Kong in 1997, there is a
debate about whether the increased availability of low-wage mainlanders will
depress wages and displace higher-paid Hong Kong residents.  The popularity of
the recent program to bring 1,000 mainland Chinese professionals into Hong Kong
as management trainees has been cited as an example of how Hong Kong workers
might be replaced by Chinese mainlanders.  The 100,000 Filipino maids in Hong
Kong have expressed fears that they will be replaced with lower-paid Chinese
domestics after 1997, echoing similar concerns of other unskilled foreign
workers now in Hong Kong.  There are already 23,000 mainland Chinese working in
Hong Kong on temporary permits and over 10,000 employees of Chinese-owned firms
have special visas. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The number of Hong Kong residents leaving the protectorate prior to 1997
dropped 20 percent to 53,000, in 1993.  The recession in Western countries and
reduced immigration quotas are believed to have caused the decline.  In 1991,
60,000 residents left the country, and 66,000 in 1992.  Most go to Canada,
Australia, New Zealand and the United States. </tt><p>

workers to Taiwan in 1993, and 83,701 foreign workers were in Taiwan as of late
March, 1994.  But the Council of Labor Affairs imposed stricter rules on
foreign employment, limiting alien workers to 30 percent of the work force in
any firm.  Employers also will not be allowed to increase the number of foreign
workers they employ; they can only replace vacancies created by foreign workers
who leave.  Currently, each employer has a set number of jobs which can be

Mixed Signals on Immigration</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia stopped the recruitment of unskilled and semi-skilled foreign
workers on January 7, 1994 in order to give the government time to reassert
control over illegal immigration--there are believed to be 500,000 to 1.5
million illegal aliens in Malaysia, meaning that illegals outnumber legal
foreign workers by 5 or 6 to 1.  However, in March 1994, the government
permitted a labor-short factory to bring "skilled" factory operatives into the
country, even though these "skilled" workers were paid unskilled worker wages.
In May 1994, the government permitted federal agencies that operate plantations
to import unskilled foreign workers legally despite the recruitment ban.
Private employers immediately wanted to know why they too could not recruit
foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>To add to the policy confusion, the Deputy Home Minister of Malaysia
asserted that 100,000 more Indonesians were needed to supplement Malaysia's
plantation work force, which includes workers from Bangladesh, Pakistan, India
and the Philippines.  Under an agreement with Indonesia, a consortium of labor
supply agents will be established to improve coordination and monitoring of
foreign workers by ensuring that all workers sent legally to Malaysia meet at
least minimum health, security and experience requirements.  Only recruitment
agents who join the consortium will be recognized by Malaysia's Home Ministry.
According to Malaysian authorities, ninety percent of the 500,000 foreign
workers in Malaysia are Indonesian (other estimates put the number of foreign
workers at one to two million).  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>During the first meeting of the Joint Committee for Border Cooperation held
in early May, Malaysia and the Philippines agreed to tighten border controls in
Sabah, where an estimated 500,000 Filipinos are 40 percent of the population.

countries to recruit engineers to work in Malaysia. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers in Malaysia will be offered personal accident insurance
coverage by the Malaysia National Insurance Company.  The insurance will be
offered to workers on an individual basis, and in late summer, group policies
will be available to recruitment agencies.  The group policy will pay benefits
in the event of accidental death, permanent and total disablement, funeral
expenses, and costs associated with returning the worker home.  The company
hopes to sign up one million foreign workers in the first year. </tt><p>

Quota Increased in Australia</a>

<tt>Australia will be increasing its number of immigrants in 1994-95 by 10,000
to 86,000, including 13,000 refugees.  Most of the additional immigration slots
are reserved for Chinese students who came to Australia after the Tiananmen
Square massacre.  The business migration program will also be expanded--the
hope is to attract and keep wealthy Hong Kong business migrants in Australia
instead of losing them to Canada.  Over the next year, 73,000 immigrants will
be admitted under family reunion, skilled, business and investment criteria, an
additional 13,000 will enter on humanitarian grounds, and 750 as other
refugees.  The number of skilled migrants will rise from 17,000 last year to
25,000 in 1994-95, and those under the family reunification program will
increase by 2,000 to 47,000. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The redesigned business skills category will require applicants to invest
at least Australian $750,000 (US$535,500) in government securities for three
years, demonstrate a record of business or investment achievement, and have
English-language proficiency.  The new rules include allowing temporary
residents who have established successful businesses to remain permanently in
Australia, instead of leaving Australia to apply for immigrant status from
abroad. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants to Australia may find life difficult.  Unemployment has hovered
at 10 percent over the past two years, and over one-third of the 949,200
unemployed have been jobless for one year or more.  A new study by the
Australian Bureau of Immigration and Population Research found that some
migrants cannot find employment because of the recession and changing attitudes
towards newcomers. The study-- based on immigrants in Adelaide--recommends new
programs to educate Australians to accept immigrants--especially about their
contributions to society.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Another study by the Bureau of Immigration Research explored the status of
the nearly 120,000 Vietnamese immigrants in Australia.  Their unemployment rate
is about three times the rate of the general population, and double that for

Setting the record Straight</u>.  Available for $10 from the Urban Institute,
2100 M St NW, Wash DC, 20037.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This well-written monograph explains that US immigration policy seeks to
admit legal immigrants and refugees and keep out illegal aliens in order to
achieve the social goal of family unification, the economic goal of growth, the
cultural goal of promoting diversity, the moral goal of providing safe haven,
and the security goal of preventing illegal immigration.  Annual immigration is
estimated to be 1.1 million but, because 400,000 immigrants die or emigrate
every year, net immigration is 700,000 per year.  These mostly Asian and Latin
American immigrants are concentrated in eight cities in six states.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Two substantive chapters review data on the labor market and public finance
impacts of recent immigrants.  The best indicator of economic success in the US
is years of education.  If US-born persons are ranked by their years of
education, the result is a diamond-shape--in 1990, 23 percent of those 25 and
older had less than a high-school education, 57 percent had a high school
diploma, and 20 percent had at least a college degree.  If recent immigrants
are similarly arrayed, the distribution has an hourglass shape--41 percent of
those 25 and older had less than a high-school education, 35 percent had a high
school diploma, and 24 percent had at least a college degree.  Making a
distribution for subgroups of immigrants indicates that Mexicans and Central
Americans have a pyramid shape--75 percent lack a high-school diploma, while
only five percent have a college degree.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The federal government makes and enforces immigration laws, while state and
local governments provide most of the public assistance to integrate
immigrants, from education for immigrant children to welfare.  The Urban
Institute is currently reviewing various studies of the costs and benefits of
immigrants to federal, state, and local governments, and it concludes that, on
balance, immigrants pay more in taxes than they use in benefits, but the taxes
they pay are primarily Social Security taxes paid to the federal government,
while the education, justice, and health services they use are provided and
paid for by state and local governments.</tt><p>

<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This 111-page report was prepared by Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, Germany's
Commission for Alien Affairs.  As a result of the law that changed Germany's
asylum procedures on July 1, 1993, there will be an annual report of foreigners
in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There were about 6.8 million foreigners living in Germany at the end of
1993, making them 8.5 percent of the population.  About three-fourths are from
non-EU countries, including 28 percent from Turkey.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreigners in Germany rose by two million since 1989,
excluding ethnic Germans who become German citizens upon their arrival from the
former Soviet Union.  Nonetheless, most foreigners in Germany have been in
Germany 10 or more years, and three-fourths of the foreign children in Germany
were born there.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are signs of convergence and divergence.  Foreign children are a much
larger fraction of those in the 16-19 age group that can be apprentices than
they are of the apprentices in training, and the unemployment rate for foreign
workers is about 1.5 times that of Germans.  Foreigners remain concentrated in
older apartments abandoned by Germans, and they often suffer discrimination in
the housing market.  As a result of the Maastricht Treaty, EU foreigners living
in Germany will gain the right to vote in local and European Parliament
elections, but non-EU foreigners will not. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The report ends with a call for a policy to regulate immigration, and a
policy to promote the integration of foreigners.</tt><p>

Paper presented at the World Bank's Annual Bank Conference on Development
Economics.  April 28-29.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This paper concludes that European governments were able to initiate
demand-pull labor migration during the 1960s, but have been less successful
controlling supply-push and network migration since the 1970s.  According to
Zimmermann's analysis, migration from Yugoslavia and Turkey was always
dominated by supply-push factors, while migration from southern European
nations such as Spain and Portugal shifted from demand-pull to supply-push
after 1973.  Asylum seekers, according to Zimmermann, are influenced by
economic variables in choosing a country to seek asylum--instead of a
house-on-fire metaphor, a follow-friends-and-relatives-to-opportunity metaphor
may be more appropriate.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>As in the US, more recent cohorts of immigrants, especially those who are
ethnically or culturally different, seem to be having a harder time catching up
to similar natives in earnings.  Although the studies reach contradictory
conclusions, even based on the same data, one study by Zimmermann found that in
Germany, a one percent increase in the share of foreigners in the workforce
reduces average hourly earnings by 4.1 percent, or by DM 0.70 ($.42) from an
average DM17.70 ($10.72).  However, the wages of more numerous blue-collar
workers fall 5.9 percent, and the wages of white collar workers rise 3.5
percent.(p31).</tt><p>

<tt>Stark, Oded.  1994.  <u>Frontier Issues in International Migration</u>.
Paper presented at the World Bank's Annual Bank Conference on Development
Economics.  April 28-29.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This paper extends the author's thinking from the relationship between
migrants and their families at home to migrants and their employers abroad.
Three questions are posed:  why do some migrants return even though wage gaps
remain, why do those who settle abroad continue to send remittances, and why do
migrants seem to catch up and surpass similar natives in earnings?  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stark asserts that employers who have incomplete information on migrants
hire all of them initially at a low wage but, after they are on the job, the
better migrants obtain higher wages and the lesser-skilled migrants return (the
so-called return of failure).  High-skilled migrants who settle allegedly remit
some of their savings for selfish reasons--to keep low-skilled migrants from
joining them abroad and perhaps lowering their wages.  Third, in a lengthy
description of migrants and nonmigrants, and cooperative and noncooperative
agents who provide information about opportunities abroad, Stark finds that
migrants with cooperative agents who go abroad will do better than nonmigrants
who stay at home. </tt><p>

Spring, 1994. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The <u>Social Contract's</u> Spring 1994 issue includes six immigration
articles.  Editor John Tanton's "End of the Migration Epoch" argues that the
medical revolution of the 17th century allowed the world's population to grow;
that the industrial revolution made rural-urban and later overseas migration
necessary, while the transportation revolution made long-distance travel easier
and cheaper; and that the communications revolution made potential migrants
aware of opportunities elsewhere.  Kingsley Davis noted that during the
1820-1920 migration epoch, historical patterns were reversed, as migrants moved
from more to less densely settled areas rather than from rural to urban areas.
Tanton lays out 10 principles that he thinks should undergird immigration
polices for the 21st century.  Available for $7.50 from 316 1/2 E Mitchell St,

Care for Hispanic Women Who Cross to the U.S. Side of the Mexico Border</u>,
Mimeo. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This 40-page paper reports on interviews with Hispanic women who had babies
in 1991-92 in San Diego county.  Of the 587 women interviewed, 12 percent (75)
said they crossed the border specifically for prenatal care or to deliver their
baby; 78 percent (459) lived in the US or crossed the border, but not
specifically to have their babies, and 9 percent (53) did not report why they
crossed.  The "crossers"--women who came specifically to the US to deliver
their baby--went to the US because: 1) they wanted a baby born in US (65
percent), 2) the medical attention is better in US (59 percent) and 3) medical
personnel are friendly and receptive (37 percent).  Almost all of the
"noncrossers" were born in Mexico--83 percent--indicating that they had in fact
crossed the border, but for reasons other than having a baby in the US.</tt><p>
<tt><u></u></tt><p>
<tt><u></u>Overall, only 14 percent of the women had health insurance; 70
percent had access to Medi-Cal.  This lack of health insurance was a
significant barrier in getting prenatal care.  A considerable proportion of the
border crossing women were high risk and required specialized medical care.
The report recommends joint planning on both sides of border to develop
strategies to provide adequate care for the women, such as using public nurses
to provide follow-up care for high-risk pregnancies on both sides of the
border. </tt><p>

Party Publishing Company, Oakland, CA. 1994) that examined infant mortality in
San Diego County.  The report explores the major causes of infant death and
recommends that the community establish a system for prenatal care to reduce
the mortality rate.  During the 1980s, San Diego County experienced a plateau
in the infant, neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates--in 1985 there were
8.8 deaths per 1000 live births, and in 1990 there were 7.2 deaths.  During
this period, the number of live births increased, as did the percentage of
minority mothers and babies requiring maternal and infant care increased.

<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Between 1971 and 1986, the US debated what to do about illegal immigration
against a backdrop whose metaphor was that illegal aliens displaced American
workers and depressed their wages by working "hard and scared."  This labor
market discussion was inconclusive, largely because case studies that found
that illegal aliens displaced Americans and depressed their wages could not be
confirmed in econometric studies that found few or no such effects in the
cities and states with the most immigrants, suggesting that any negative labor
market effects of immigrants were very localized.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>One reason why there were few negative effects of immigrants detected
during the 1980s was that the economies of the states that attracted the most
immigrants--California, Texas, and Florida--grew rapidly, taking the edge off
of any labor market effects of illegal immigrants because Americans were
displaced.  In the end, the rationale for IRCA in 1986 was that illegal
immigration is illegal, and that the back door of illegal immigration should be
closed in order to keep the front door open.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Today the debate over illegal immigration has changed.  The new emphasis is
on the PUBLIC costs and benefits of legal and illegal immigrants--how much do
the services provided to them cost (and which level of government pays for
them), how much do immigrants pay in taxes, and to which level of government do
these taxes flow.  There is agreement that the taxes paid by immigrants tend to
flow to the federal government, while the costs of the services they consume
are paid for by state and local taxes (MN, May, 1994).  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There is disagreement on the amounts of taxes paid and the costs of
services provided, but, once again, perhaps the most important question cannot
yet be answered--how will the balance of taxes paid and the cost of services
change over time?</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Immigrant Catch-up<i></i></tt><p>
<tt><i></i>The first studies of immigrant economic integration were generally
optimistic. Economist Barry Chiswick found that the motivation etc that
encouraged people to move across borders also helped them to catch up and earn
more within about 15 years than US-born people with similar levels of education
.  These studies were based on 1970 and 1980 data, so they reflected the
experiences of immigrants who arrived in the 1950s and 1960s.  During the
1980s, studies by economist George Borjas found that the average level of
education of immigrants was declining and, with less education, their
probability of achieving ever-higher US incomes fell.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The 1990 US Census demonstrated that the immigrants who arrived during the
1980s were significantly different than the US population.  When ranked by
education, the immigrant characteristic most likely to indicate economic
success has a barbell or hourglass shape--they are more likely than natives to
have a college education, AND they are more likely than natives to have less
than a high-school education.  US-born citizens, when arrayed by their years of
education, have more of a diamond-shape, with most Americans in the middle at
the high-school graduate level.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Immigration and Welfare </tt><p>
<tt>According to the 1990 Census of Population, the 20 million legal and
illegal immigrants were 8.5 percent of the US population.  Almost half of these
immigrants arrived during the 1980s, and almost two-thirds of the 1980s
immigrants arrived in the second half of the decade.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The US spent $300 billion on means-tested assistance in 1992, and an
estimated $5 trillion on cash payments (AFDC) to poor families, food stamps,
and similar programs since 1965.  Since not all of these programs determine
accurately the legal status of recipients, it is very difficult to determine
whether a higher percentage of immigrants or natives are and will be receiving
"public assistance."  An analysis of 1990 Census data by George Borjas found
that slightly more households headed by foreign-born persons received welfare
assistance, and these immigrant households received a disproportionate share of
welfare payments in 1989.</tt><p>
<tt><i></i></tt><p>
<tt><i></i>However, welfare dependence varies between immigrant subgroups.
Only refugees and elderly legal immigrants tend to go on welfare upon their
arrival or as soon as they are eligible.  Relatively few non-refugees who
arrived in the 1980s--many of whom were illegal aliens who became legal
residents in the 1986-87 amnesty--received public assistance in 1989, in part
because many were ineligible when the 1990 Census of Population asked them
about their income the year before.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Because so many of the immigrants included in the 1990 Census of Population
were not eligible for welfare assistance, "snapshot" analysts must be very
careful about making over time projections of welfare dependence on the basis
of one-year's data.  For example, it is true that Census data show that poor
Mexican immigrant households in California are much less likely to be on
welfare than poor US-born Mexican-American households, but it is not clear
whether the immigrants' lower welfare usage in 1989 reflected their
ineligibility OR an anti-welfare immigrant culture, as some have
claimed.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The data support the conclusion of demographer Frank Bean of the University
of Texas --a rising number of poor immigrant households during the 1980s did
NOT translate into a proportional increase the number of welfare recipients in
1989.  Some extend this to argue that the US and California can receive poor
immigrants and not see its welfare rolls increase.  About 41 percent of the
native-born poor Mexican households received public assistance, versus 18
percent of the poor immigrant households headed by persons born in Mexico.
[The number of <u>poor</u> immigrant households in California doubled during
the 1980s to 509,000, and 20 percent of them (104,000) received public
assistance, versus 26 percent (230,000) of the poor non-immigrant households].
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>However, no one knows whether these "snapshot" studies will be indicative
of the relationship between poor immigrants and welfare in the 1990s.  It seems
clear that eligibility restrictions, among other things, prevented most poor
immigrants from immediately getting public assistance.  The exceptions are
refugees and the elderly, who do go on welfare at relatively high rates when
they become eligible.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The effect of newly-legalized aliens on welfare rates may be significant,
since higher percentages of immigrants who arrived before 1980 are on welfare
than 1980s arrivals from countries in which the largest numbers of persons were
legalized in the 1987-88 amnesty (newly-legalized aliens were generally not
eligible for welfare in 1989, the Census year for income data).  For example,
13 percent of the Mexicans who arrived before 1980 were on welfare in 1989,
versus 11 percent of all Mexican immigrants in the US in 1990, 10 percent of
the El Salvadorans who arrived before 1980, versus seven percent, and 30
percent of the pre-1980 Dominicans, versus 28 percent.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Countries from which large numbers of refugees came to the US have a
pattern of declining welfare dependence.  Refugees are eligible for welfare
upon their arrival, and 26 percent of all Vietnamese immigrants, but only 16
percent of pre-1980 Vietnamese immigrants, received welfare in 1989.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Snapshot data from the Census cannot answer the really important question:
will poor immigrants get public assistance after they are in the US long enough
to be eligible for benefits?  Americans clearly worry that as poor immigrants
become  eligible for welfare, they will apply for benefits.  According to the
Los Angeles Times, three-fourths of California voters support that Save our
State initiative that is likely to go before voters in November 1994--it would
cut off most welfare benefits to undocumented residents.  Half of those polled
would support preventing illegal children from attending public schools.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Poor immigrants are entitled by law and court decisions to a number of
welfare benefits, so that, in many cases, changes would have to be made in
order to deny them benefits.  The major three programs that provide benefits to
illegal aliens are public education (Head Start, public school education from
grades K through 12, and school meal subsidies), WIC food coupons, and
emergency health care.  In most studies, public education, at about $5,000 per
child per year, accounts for two-thirds of the costs of these benefits.  Once
aliens achieve a permanent legal status (green card), they are entitled to
AFDC, Food Stamps, and Medicaid. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>For example, a profile of a Mexican illegal alien receiving welfare in
Texas indicated that those interviewed--single mothers--intended to clean
houses, not go on welfare.  But after a baby born in the US gave the family a
US citizen who was eligible for welfare, this poor family began receiving Food
Stamps and WIC food coupons available to mothers with small children.  This
mother asserted that, even if these benefits on which her family depends were
eliminated, she would try to stay in the US, largely because the US offered
more opportunities for poor children like hers.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Economist George Borjas believes that immigrants such as this woman are
becoming more dependent on welfare.  Among non-refugees, the more
recently-arrived cohorts are more likely than were earlier immigrants to get
some welfare benefits, and to remain more dependent on at least some
means-tested programs over their lives than were earlier immigrants.  Among
refugees, many of whom get welfare upon their arrival, the rate at which they
reduce their welfare dependence seems to be declining among recent
arrivals.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt><i>Conclusions</i></tt><p>
<tt><i></i>There are two benchmark studies of the public benefits and costs of
immigrants--the Huddle study concluded that the immigrants who arrived in the
US since 1970 impose annual costs of $70 billion, while the Urban Institute
concluded that these immigrants represent a $30 billion net gain (Migration
News, May 1994).  Both look back to see how immigrants who arrived in earlier
years were faring 10 or more years later, and both make assumptions about the
hard-to-measure effects of immigrants on natives.  But neither tackles the
question of how fast immigrant earnings are likely to rise as they integrate
into the US--will they remain poor and go on welfare as they become eligible,
or will they succeed economically, and avoid applying for benefits even if they
are eligible?  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The debate is most heated in California, a high tax and high service state
that is relatively generous with welfare benefits---it was the only major
industrial state to increase benefits with the cost-of living--and it receives
about 40 percent of the nation's immigrants.  In the past, California received
immigrants from abroad and migrants from other states.  Today, California is
losing older and higher income residents to other states--between 1990 and
1993, California lost residents aged 35 and older, as well as those high school
graduates who had not completed college--and gaining young persons without a
high-school diploma.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>While no one can predict the future, the Great Migration from the US South
during the 1950s and 1960s may provide some useful insights.  When over one
million US citizens annually left rural and southern homes for northern cities,
there were predictions that these migrants would not seek welfare because such
assistance was not available in the areas from which they came, and that there
were cultural barriers to dependence on government programs. A combination of
residency restrictions and man-in-the-house rules seemed to prove these
speculations initially correct.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>However, as the 1960s unfolded, there was a steadily rising participation
of rural-urban immigrants in a welfare system that was offering more benefits
and easier access to them--the rate at which those eligible participated
resembled the letter S--initially few participated, then there was a sharply
rising rate of participation, and then participation leveled off.  No one yet
knows whether eligible immigrants will follow a similar path.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC2">Wilson-Clinton
Spar over Immigration Monies</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>California Governor Pete Wilson filed a second suit on May 31, against the
federal government in an attempt to recoup nearly $370 million in costs for
providing health services to illegal immigrants.  The first lawsuit filed by
Wilson seeks nearly $2 billion from the federal government to reimburse costs
from incarcerating illegal alien felons.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The $370 million suit seeks to collect funds from the federal government to
pay for the costs of providing "emergency" medical services to an estimated
309,000 illegal immigrants.  Wilson said, "The federal government can't keep
sweeping the problem of illegal immigration under the rug while sweeping the
costs onto our already overburdened state taxpayers." </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton Administration responded on June 21 with a proposal to spend
$25 billion on immigrants, including $8.4 billion in California, one-third more
than the Bush Administration spent.  The Wilson Administration countered that
the Clinton spending promise mixed together funds for legal and illegal
immigrant aid.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The governors of California, Arizona, Florida, who have already sued the
federal government, testified on June 21 before the Senate Appropriations
Committee to press their demand for reimbursement of the costs their states
incur to provide services to illegal aliens.  Senators were sympathetic to the
governors descriptions of the influx of illegal aliens as analogous to a
natural disaster or an invasion, but told the governors that it would be hard
to respond to their pleas for money because of the federal budget
deficit.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>It is difficult to get Congress to approve immigrant impact assistance for
a handful of states.  The April proposal by the Clinton Administration to
provide $350 million to help cover the cost of incarcerating illegal aliens in
state prisons was converted in June to an anti-drug program that would provide
benefits to all states.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC3">First
Haitians Processed at Sea</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Six of the 35 Haitians picked up at sea on June 16 and processed on the
ship Comfort, anchored in Kingston Harbor, Jamaica, were granted refugee
status.  During the first week of the program, 226 Haitians who left Haiti in
small boats were picked up by the US Coast Guard and taken to Jamaica to
determine if they were refugees. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>These are the first Haitian refugees to be processed at sea under the new
Clinton plan.  Previously, the Haitians would have been immediately returned to
Haiti and would have to apply for asylum from their country regardless of the
threat of persecution.  The Haitians will not be allowed to enter Jamaica, and
the operation is scheduled to last for less than six months.  The Clinton
Administration is expecting the number of Haitians to be processed to jump to
about 2,000 per week .  That is a dramatic increase over the 130 Haitians that
the Coast Guard has been picked up each week this year.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A representative from the UN Commission for Refugees will be on board the
ship to explain to the Haitians how the interviews will be conducted and to
answer questions.  The UNHCR has said that those rejected for asylum should be
sent to a safe country until the current Haitian government is removed. The 29
Haitians who were denied asylum on June 16 will be returned to Haiti. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A sympathetic portrait of the 450,000 Haitian-Americans--the 1990 Census Of
Population counted only 306,000 in a severe undercount--emphasizes the
diversity of the immigrants from the nation of seven million (average per
capita GNP in 1991 was $380) that shares an island of Hispanola with seven
million Dominicans (average per capita GNP in 1991 was $940).
Haitian-Americans are mostly middle class--in the 1990 COP, 40 percent had at
least some college education, while only 10 percent had less than an
eighth-grade education.  Haitian-Americans are concentrated around New York
City, where they are 1.5 percent of the population, and Miami (6
percent).</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Haitian immigration to the US peaked in 1980-81, when 45,000 Haitians
arrived.  In 1981, President Reagan ordered that Haitians be stopped at sea
and, through 1991, only 28 of 22,716 Haitians intercepted were admitted to the
US.  Despite generally high levels of education--half of the adult Haitians in
New York City have some college education--seven percent of the Haitian
immigrants there, and 25 percent of second-generation Haitians--are on
welfare.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Florida in June deported the first 113 of the 2,700 illegal aliens who were
jailed in the state for committing non-violent offenses in the US.  All but
three of the first prisoners to be deported were convicted of drug trafficking,
and their release is expected to save Florida up to $15,000 per alien per year.
Some 4,100 of Florida's 54,000 prisoners are foreigners and, according to INS,
1,400 of the foreigners were in the US legally when they committed their
crimes.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">Immigrant
Day Laborers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In many California cities, immigrants congregate in lumber and hardware
stores  parking lots and on street corners to wait for employers to hire them
on a daily basis.  These labor shape-ups are considered less-than-satisfactory
by immigrant advocates, who note that unscrupulous employers can go from one to
another cheating the workers they hire; by local residents, who complain of
loitering immigrants; and by employers, who are not sure if qualified workers
will be available. Union employees complain that the illegal immigrants hired
in such day labor markets are willing to work for cut-rate wages--from less
than half of union rates to below minimum wage. The undocumented workers are
competing in construction markets that already offer fewer jobs because of a
stall in home building. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Several cities have tried to organize hiring halls--buildings that offer
sanitary facilities and some services, such as English as a Second Language,
for day laborers.  Some hiring centers cater only to undocumented workers,
others welcome all the unemployed, and some screen workers to determine if they
can work legally in the US.  However, if the centers do screen for legal
status, then they may duplicate state Employment Services, an already existing
network of offices that match workers with jobs for no fee.  If the centers do
not screen workers for legal status, they may be using public funds to help
unauthorized workers find US jobs. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Hiring centers that are "immigration blind" do not usually offer
specialized services because they serve a diverse unemployed clientele.  Hiring
centers that screen for immigration status offer more services, but only to
documented workers.  Some workers avoid the hiring centers for fear employers
will not hire workers who go to them.   </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Hiring centers have been tried numerous times as substitutes for curbside
hiring in southern California, especially after communities ban curbside
hiring.   A University of California, San Diego study of three such centers
concluded that the one which did not screen workers for legal status was more
successful than the two that did. It also concluded that hiring centers can not
work without community support. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles is one of the most recent cities trying to deal with the
problems created by curbside hiring.  After protests by local residents, Los
Angeles County on May 24 enacted an ordinance that bans, effective July 1,
1994, laborers from curbside solicitation of jobs--curbside job-seeking  will
be a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.  The
three county supervisors who supported the measure to restrict day laborers
said that they were trying to reduce traffic and sanitation problems, not send
an anti-immigrant message.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles' district attorney threatened not to enforce the ordinance,
saying that, "it would be difficult for me to prosecute someone for simply
trying to get a job."  The ban on curbside hiring affects only unincorporated
areas of the county, where about 10 percent of Los Angeles 9.2 million people
live.  The city of Los Angeles has opened hiring halls for immigrants, while
nearby Agoura Hills banned curbside hiring in July 1991 after a worker was
killed in the rush to trucks to find day jobs; its ban was upheld by California
courts in May 1994.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The wealthy Malibu Colony outside of Los Angeles has had a mixed experience
with hiring centers.  A hiring center opened in 1990, but closed four months
later.  In December 1991, a task force recommended opening an official hiring
center and passing an ordinance to prohibit employers from hiring at
unauthorized sites.  In 1993, the Malibu Labor Exchange Center opened with
support from city and county officials, and it is credited with reducing the
number of places day laborers congregate.  Over 30 workers report to the center
each day, and 20 requests for workers are made by employers. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In the Northern California county of Marin, the INS reports that legal
immigrants are turning in illegal immigrants at day labor sites because too
many workers are competing for too few jobs.  The Canal Area of Marin has an
estimated 10,000 residents; since January 1993, the INS has arrested between
1,000 and 1,500 illegal</tt><p>
<tt>immigrants in the area.  However, many are set free with temporary work
permits so that they can support themselves until their deportation
hearing--one to 12 months later.  Temporary work permits entitle illegal
immigrants to apply for temporary Social Security cards and work anywhere in
the United States--2,000 are issued each month in the Bay Area.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">Immigration
and the California Election '94</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Between 1980 and 1990, California added six million to its population,
bringing it to 30 million, and three million jobs.  The population growth was
fueled by natural increase  (births exceeding deaths) and by immigration as
well as more Americans from other states moving to California than left the
state.  The job boom was the result of economic growth nationwide, and
especially rising defense expenditures.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Since 1990, population growth has slowed, and California has lost jobs.
Natural increase is about 400,000 annually, and legal and illegal immigration
adds about 300,000.  However, about 250,000 more Americans leave than enter
California, meaning that the state adds only about 450,000 new residents
annually, two-thirds of 1980s levels.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>California lost 600,000 jobs since mid-1990, or 200,000 per year.  Many of
the lost jobs paid relatively high wages, since they were associated with
defense manufacturing.  Many of the new jobs created, on the other hand, have
been lower wage service jobs.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Immigration was not the cause of the demographic or economic shifts in
California in the 1990s, but the fact that legal and illegal immigrants
continue to arrive in large numbers at a time when the state budget is strained
made immigration one of the top four issues in the race for Governor --in a Los
Angeles Times exit poll on June 7, the day the political parties picked their
candidates for the November 8 election, immigration and education joined the
economy and crime as the issues most important to voters.  California Governor
Pete Wilson highlighted immigration as a problem for California and advocated
reducing services especially to illegal immigrants, as well as developing more
reliable identification documents.  His Republican challenger did not make
controlling illegal immigration the basis of his campaign--but he did propose
reduced services and preferences such as bilingual education and affirmative
action to turn off the "social welfare magnet" that allegedly encourages
illegal immigrants to come to California.  </tt><p>
<tt><b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The two major Democratic candidates also argued that something must
be done to reduce illegal immigration, but they favored border and interior
enforcement to keep illegal immigrants out and prevent those who slip in from
getting jobs. Kathleen Brown argued for more federal Border Patrol agents and a
reliable identification system, while John Garamendi argued for a reliable
identification system and endorsed PRIDE principles--Proponents for Responsible
Immigration Debate and Education--which include continuation of jus solis,
continued immigrant access to health and education services, and economic
assistance for Mexico and other sending nations.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>US Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA) reintroduced legislation to require
counterfeit-proof worker ID cards for all workers and to cut some welfare
benefits now available to immigrants.  Feinstein's bill also proposes stiffer
penalties for alien smuggling, streamlines mechanisms for deporting criminal
illegal aliens, and establishes a $1.00 border-crossing fee to help pay for
beefed-up enforcement. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC6">Public
Opinion on Immigrants</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A public opinion poll released by the Field Institute on June 9 found that
most Californians support measures to slow down illegal immigration, including
a $1 dollar fee for crossing the border to provide more funds for border
enforcement and deporting illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Proposals to deny services to illegal immigrants vary by the ethnicity of
the respondent.  Three-fourths of the Californians polled believe illegal
immigrants should not receive welfare payments.  Among white voters, 85 percent
oppose welfare for  illegal immigrants; among Latinos, 50 percent are in favor.
Illegal immigrants are not eligible for US welfare, but their US citizen
children are entitled to benefits.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>About 55 percent of whites favor amending the US Constitution to deny
automatic citizenship to children born in the US of undocumented immigrants,
and 59 percent of the whites believe that the children of illegal aliens should
not be allowed to attend public schools--77 percent of the Latinos, by
contrast, approve illegal alien children in public schools.  Non-voters tend to
support public education for illegal alien children, while voters do not.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Most Californians do not support the creation of special identification
cards to control illegal immigration--49 percent said agreed such a was not a
good idea.  However, 55 percent of the whites oppose an ID card, while 56
percent of the Latinos thought it would be a good idea. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A national CBS poll conducted in May found that 29 percent of those
surveyed think immigrants contribute to the US, while 53 percent said they
cause problems. Only 16 percent agreed that immigrants would make American
society better, 41 percent said they would make it worse, and 32 percent said
they wouldn't affect American society.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The share of Americans who agree that economic hard times in the United
States make it difficult to continue welcoming immigrants who arrive with few
assets rose to 65 percent, up from 60 percent in January, and 45 percent in a
1986  poll, CBS reported that despite these opinions, only 34 percent said
immigration should be stopped, while 19 percent said the US should always
welcome immigrants.  Thirty-two percent said immigrants take jobs from
Americans, but 52 percent said they were jobs Americans didn't want anyway.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The US Conference of Mayors reported the results of a survey of the leaders
of 78 cities at their annual meeting in Portland on June 13.  It found that the
benefits produced by immigrants in these cities are believed to outweigh the
problems associated with the delivery of services to them. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The report found that foreign-born persons represent an average 11 percent
of the population in the 78 cities, and more than one-fourth of the cities
believe that their foreign-born population was undercounted in the 1990 census.
Just over two out of three of the cities reported that they have benefited from
the presence of immigrants, principally through economic development, increased
availability of both skilled and unskilled labor, and social and cultural
contributions to the community.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The major problems were in the delivery and financing of health, social,
language and other services.  Fifty-seven percent of the cities said these
problems relate to the presence of legal immigrants; 56 percent said they
relate to the</tt><p>
<tt>presence of undocumented persons.  City governments in nearly one-third of
the cities help new immigrants to resettle.  Officials surveyed called for
increased resources for the Border Patrol to reduce illegal immigration.</tt><p>

Self-Employment--A Two-Edged Sword</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A higher percentage of immigrants (7.6 percent) than natives (7 percent)
were self employed in the 1990 Census Of Population, and the proportion of
immigrants who are self employed tends to rise with time in the US.
Self-employed immigrants have the highest average incomes of all types of
immigrants--$30,000 in 1989--and they are credited with revitalizing inner city
neighborhoods from Watts to Brooklyn.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>However, immigrant revitalization can be a two-edged sword.  Chinese
immigrants who created New York's third largest Chinatown in Brooklyn drove out
drug dealers and pushed up real estate values, but they also brought sweatshops
and Asian gangs into the area.  An estimated 10,000 Chinese immigrants--perhaps
one-third illegal aliens--work up to 70 hours weekly for as little as $500
monthly, an hourly wage that is less than half of the federal $4.25 minimum.
It has proven to be very difficult to enforce labor and other laws that set
minimum standards in neighborhoods with large numbers of recent
immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Many of the 65,000 Chinese in Brooklyn were legalized under a provision of
IMMACT (1990) that opened slots for those in the US after the 1989 Tiananmen
Square killings.   </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC8">English-Only
Rules in the Workplace</a>
</a><br>
</h2>
<tt>The US Supreme Court refused to decide on the validity of a 24-year old
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission policy that employer rules which
required only English in the workplace were presumed to be discriminatory.
According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 120 US employers have
been accused of unfairly imposing English-only rules.  In 1993, the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the EEOC had no authority to issue such a
rule prohibiting English-only in the workplace and, when this ruling was
appealed to the US Supreme Court, the Clinton Administration urged that the
federal appeals court ruling be overturned.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This means that a California company can continue to require that its
employees speak only English on the job.  The Clinton Administration had argued
that the appeals court ruling--which made it more difficult for employees to
challenge English-only workplace rules--makes it too hard for employees who
wish to speak a language other than English at work to challenge the "business
necessity" of such rules.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In one such case in San Francisco, five Filipino-American security guards
were reassigned after a false alarm got officials out of bed because the guard
on duty allegedly had such a strong accent that his explanation could not be
understood.  They were awarded $87,500 from the US government, and additional
funds from their employer, a private security firm, for discrimination.

<tt>Operation Hold the Line has reduced the number of illegal aliens entering
the US near El Paso, Texas from 10,000 to 100 per day, according to the INS.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>However, there may be some diversion of aliens attempting entry to Arizona.
The Tucson INS sector, for example, apprehended an average 6,000 aliens monthly
in FY 1992, and 7,700 monthly in FY93.  However, in April 1994, apprehensions
rose to almost 15,000, leading some to speculate that aliens are simply being
diverted along the 2000 mile US-Mexican border.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In a visit to the border region in San Diego, INS Commissioner Doris
Meissner said that over the next six months, 400 border agents will be added to
the San Diego border area and they will get 222 new patrol cars with encrypted
radios so that alien smugglers can't hear their conversations.  A new computer
system called ENFORCE puts 51 INS forms into an integrated computer database
and reduces processing time from 20 minutes to three or four minutes for each
alien apprehended will be tested in San Diego in July.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Reacting to the success of Operation Hold the Line, the House
Appropriations Committee on June 15 approved the addition of 700 Border Patrol
agents. <b> </b>The $4.5 million measure must now be approved by the full House
of Representatives and the Senate before these additional agents can be hired.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The US House of Representatives also authorized the use of active-duty
military personnel to police the Mexican border.  This amendment to the defense
authorization bill would authorize the Secretary of Defense to order military
personnel to assist the Customs Service to inspect cargo, motor vehicles and

<tt>Four deadlines for a border-free Europe have come and gone.  The current
target date for a border-free Europe is October 1994.  There are today more
stories of restoring border checks and controls than progress toward their
elimination.  As one perhaps unanticipated consequence of another EU
agreement--the Dublin agreements that require asylum applicants to have their
cases heard in the first EU country they reach-- countries such as the
Netherlands have stepped up their use of border checks--including using video
cameras to prove that asylum applicants entered from Germany for asylum, and
thus must be returned to Germany to apply. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In May 1994, Denmark applied to become an observer under the Schengen
convention, a move expected to put pressure on Britain and Ireland, as well as
the other Nordic countries expected to join the EU in 1995, to take steps
toward a border-free Europe.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The European Parliament will create a European Ombudsman after June 1994
elections and, according to some observers, complaints about border controls
should keep the ombudsman busy.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On June 20, 1994 EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers approved a
resolution that would confirm at the EU level national restrictions on
immigration.  Over the protest of the Belgium minister, a Resolution that
national polices restricting</tt><p>
<tt>immigrant workers from entering countries "should be maintained and
where</tt><p>
<tt>necessary reinforced" was approved.  According to the resolution, EU member
nations should "refuse entry to their territories of third-country
nationals</tt><p>
<tt>for the purpose of employment," with "admission for temporary employment"
permitted only as " a very narrow exception" in cases where there is a vacant
job that requires specialized skills and, if unfilled, the viability of the
business is threatened.  There are exceptions for seasonal foreign workers
employed for less than six months, and for trainees in the host EU country for
up to 12 months.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This resolution contradicts the February proposal (COMMA (94) 23) of
Padraig Flynn, the European Commissioner with responsibility for immigration
issues, to permit the nine million legal immigrants living in the EU to move
and work in another Member State.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The ministers also approved a feasibility study of the EURODAC network.  If
implemented, the system would fingerprint asylum-seekers and suspected illegal
immigrants at their first point of entry, and then circulate the information
among member nations.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC12">Immigration
in Germany</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Germany is the major country of immigration in Europe.  Over the past five
years, an average 830,000 foreigners annually arrived in the former West
Germany, producing one of the world's highest rates of immigration.  In the
former West Germany, deaths exceed births, so that immigrants who add about 1.5
percent annually to the 60 million population there are far more visible than
the comparable rate of immigration to turn-of-the-century US.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Germany's "melting pot" has been marked by violence against and marches in
support of foreigners;  Ueberfremdung(overforeignization) was deemed the
"worst" new word to enter the German vocabulary in 1993.  However, there is
still no German immigration or immigrant (integration) policy.  Chancellor Kohl
has appealed to his EU partners to develop an EU-wide immigration policy to
deal with immigration, what he called the central challenge "facing Europe in
the 1990s."  However, after 12 years in office, his coalition government has
dealt only with asylum--it has not so far tackled naturalization or rules for
admitting immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Naturalization</tt><p>
<tt>Germany has a rather difficult naturalization procedure that includes the
requirement that persons wishing to become German citizens give up their
original citizenship.  One proposal to deal with naturalization is to allow
dual citizenship and to allow non-citizen residents to vote in local elections.
At its three-day congress in early June, 1994, the FDP (Free Democratic Party)
pledged to introduce legislation that would reform Germany's 1913 citizenship
laws and permit foreigners to vote in local elections if Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's governing coalition is returned to power in the October 1994 election.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, Commissioner for Aliens Affairs, was elected to
the FDP presidium at the Congress.  She has been championing dual citizenship
and similar reforms to promote the integration of foreigners in Germany.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>President Demirel of Turkey in April 1994 appealed for Turks living in
Germany to give up their Turkish citizenship and become naturalized Germans so
that they could become a more effective "lobby for Turkey" in Europe.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Asylum</tt><p>
<tt>The number of asylum seekers in Germany continued to fall in 1994.  After
averaging 12,000 monthly between January and April, the number of asylum
seekers fell to 9,300 in May.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There has been a great deal of speculation about how illegal attempts to
enter Germany would respond to the July 1, 1993 changes in German asylum laws
and procedures.  On the German-Polish border, apprehensions have decreased,
from an average 1,500 monthly--two-thirds Romanians-- in 1993 to 1,200 monthly
in April and May 1994.  In 1992, there were 46,200 foreigners apprehended on
the job in Germany, and there were 5,200 preliminary proceedings initiated
against contract workers suspected of working illegally.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>About 86,000 Germans emigrated in 1992; two-thirds of them remained in
Europe.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Almost 50,000 Aussiedler (ethnic Germans), most from the Asian republics of
the former USSR,  arrived in Germany during the first three months of 1994.
Under a 1993 revision of the German law, a maximum 225,000 Aussiedler are
permitted to enter Germany each year from the former USSR. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In April 1994, the German Parliament amended its Employment Promotion Law
(Beschaeftigugngsforderungsgesetz) to permit private employment agencies to
match even unskilled workers and jobs.  This reform also permits unemployed
workers drawing UI benefits to be placed for up to three months in seasonal
agricultural jobs for which they will receive 25DM ($15) daily.  In 1993, most
of the 200,000 seasonal foreign workers employed in Germany worked in
agriculture.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC13">Immigration
in European Elections</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Immigration was an issue in recent elections across Europe.  Voters in
European Union nations went to the polls on June 9 and 12 to choose members for
five-year terms in the European Parliament.  The Greek chair of the EU's
Council for Foreign Ministers says that employment and migration flows will be
the "main economic and social problems for the next decade." </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>However, local issues rather than overarching issues such as immigration
seemed to influence voting in many countries.  Voter turnout was low--about 50
percent.  The Socialists were rejected by voters in France; Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Christian Democrats staged a major comeback after a shaky start; John
Major's Conservative Party lost half of its 32 seats in the European Parliament
to  the Labor Party; and the governing Spanish Socialists led by Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez paid for Spain's 22 percent unemployment rate losing to the
conservative Popular Party. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Hard campaigning by Chancellor Kohl in Germany, as well as a recovering
economy and a strong stand against continued immigration, helped the CDU widen
its lead over the Social Democrats. A compromise between Kohl's CDU and the
Social Democrats in 1993 sharply decreased the number of asylum seekers into
Germany, and helped to explain why the rightist Republicans are likely to fall
short of the five percent threshold needed to win seats in the Bundestag in the
October federal elections--they won only 3.9 percent of the vote.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The far-right Nationalist Front in France experienced similar problems.
Instead of an expected 15 percent of the vote, the Nationalist Front received
only 10.5 percent.  Analysts say the conservative government's success in
imposing stricter immigration controls negated the Nationalist Front's hottest
issue--immigration. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On June 12, 1994, Austria said yes to Europe--66 percent of Austrian voters
approved the country becoming the thirteenth member nation of the EU.  A yes
vote, which seemed assured earlier in 1994 when Austria, Norway, Sweden and
Finland scheduled referendums on EU membership, was made uncertain by fears
that Austria would lose its identity and be overrun by foreigners.  The
questions directed to the government's "Say yes to Europe" campaign offices
included "Could all foreigners, including Turks, settle in Austria?" reflecting
fears that foreigners would flood the country due to the EU's allegedly looser
border controls.</tt><p>

<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Over the past two years, about 870 refugees--many without passports or
documents-- have arrived in Sweden by boat from Latvia, which is only 90 miles
across the Baltic Sea.  In early 1994, the Swedish government attempted to slow
the flow of asylum-seekers by raising the penalty for smuggling aliens from six
months to two years in prison.  Sweden also donated nine retrofitted former
coast guard patrol boats to the three Baltic countries, and helped train
customs officers in Estonia. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Almost all of the boat refugees en route to Sweden come via Russia.
Official Russian estimates are that more than 500,000 foreigners are awaiting
onward passage.  A Swedish immigration ministry spokesperson said that Sweden's
liberal asylum laws and generous welfare system attract asylum-seekers.  The
Swedish government does not return asylum seekers to Afghanistan or Iraq, but
does return those from Bangladesh.  Sweden would like the Baltic states to
improve border controls and sign the Geneva Convention on Refugees so that the
Swedish government could return asylum-seekers. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Nordic countries, the United States and Canada will give the Baltics
and Belarus $1.5 million to support their efforts to prevent illegal
immigration and assist refugees.  The program includes assistance to Russian
speakers in the Baltics who want to remigrate to Russia, and also for those who
want to move to Latin America or other regions. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC21">Taiwan
Threatens to Halt Importation of Filipino Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan is threatening to halt the importation of Filipino workers because
of new employment requirements placed on the workers and their Taiwanese
employers by the Filipino government.  Taiwan has about 183,000 foreign workers
in the country, including at least 50,000 Filipinos, who work primarily as
domestics and nurses. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The employment requirements are meant to protect Filipinos working in
Taiwan.  They require Taiwanese employers of Filipino domestic helpers and
private nurses to provide workers compensation insurance in the event of
on-the-job injury and advise the worker of their financial status.  The Taiwan
government objects to these rules because they infringe upon its sovereignty.
The issues are expected to be discussed at the annual labor talks later this
month. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Taiwan Association of Employment Agencies supports a ban on new
Filipino workers--it is not submitting requests for any new workers to Manila.
Taiwan labor officials say that if the additional Filipino workers are banned,
they will allow employers to bring in workers from other countries. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Taiwan Council of Labor Affairs  has considered freezing the
importation of  foreign workers because the labor shortage is "over."  The
council would make exceptions for companies investing over NT$100 million, but
these companies would not be allowed to have foreigner workers exceed 30
percent of the company's work force. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some Taiwanese employers apparently do not treat foreign workers well--they
have been ordered to improve the safety, health and welfare conditions for
their foreign workers or face penalties.  Typical violations include too many
overtime hours, no days off, and failure to provide proper welfare benefits.

<a name="RTFToC22">Japan:
Chinese Illegal Immigrants and Guestworkers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Over 4,000 Chinese entered Japan illegally, primarily to work, in the past
five and one-half years, according the Justice Ministry's Immigration Bureau.
Many of the illegal immigrants are believed to have been smuggled aboard
freighters and other vessels by the Chinese mafia, called Snake Head.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The number of migrants being smuggled into Japan in groups is rising.  In
1990, 18 Chinese arrived in two groups; in 1992, 396 arrived in 14 groups; and,
in 1993, 335 arrived in seven groups.  Between January and May, 1994, 250
Chinese in eight groups were smuggled into Japan. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some Vietnamese set out in boats for Japan, transiting through Hong Kong,
because of a rumor that Japan is welcoming foreign workers with financial
assistance and extended visa stays.  The UNHCR is working in Hue, Vietnam to
halt the spread of the rumor.  Last month Japan announced that it would return
any boat people who arrived in the country after March 5, without screening
them for refugee status. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Thirty-one nations agreed at a meeting in Geneva in February that
Vietnamese would no longer be given preferential treatment over asylum seekers
form other countries. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Japanese Guestworkers</tt><p>
<tt>Haruo Shimada, Japan's best-known labor economist, recently released a
220-page book that showcases his proposal to develop a work-and-learn program
through which unskilled workers could fill vacant jobs, learn skills and, if
they settled, be accepted and integrated into Japanese society.  The book has
eight chapters grouped into three parts--overview, a work-and-learn temporary
worker proposal, and long-term solutions to the problem of illegal immigration
and labor shortages in Japan.  Getting the Japanese to accept foreigners may
not be easy--a Tokyo poll reported that 64 percent of residents dislike having
foreigners in their neighborhoods, and 57 percent agreed that the Japanese
discriminate against foreigners. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Most of the book is devoted to explaining why guestworkers are inevitable,
and why the foreigners admitted must have legal status, be paid appropriate
wages and housed and trained by their Japanese employers, and why Japan must be
prepared to integrate those who will settle after their three- to five-year
work-and-learn programs.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The book provides a valuable summary of recent Japanese immigration policy
and data, and carefully explains a leading proposal to deal with illegal
immigration.  It is hortatory, however, and may not do full justice to those
who oppose foreign workers in Japan.  The need or demand for (foreign) workers
depends on their cost, and if EMPLOYERS had to bear all of the costs that would
be implicit in the work-and-learn proposal--everything from preparatory
Japanese language training to on-the-job training in Japan--they may decide
they do not need many foreign workers--automating, adjusting workplaces and
wages to attract local workers, or investing abroad might seem more attractive.
If society as a whole bears these costs, then employers who offer 3D
jobs--dirty, dangerous, and difficult--are being subsidized to maintain such
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The central issue facing countries such as Japan is simple.  Demographics
make it clear that the supply of workers in the future will be limited--even if
wages and workplaces were radically altered, low-fertility Japan would soon run
out of the workers needed for a growing labor force.  What is not clear is how
sensitive the demand for additional workers is to rising wages, i.e., how
needed are unskilled foreign workers?  Industrial nations are not testing the
sensitivity of the demand for unskilled foreign workers to labor shortages
because illegal workers are showing up everywhere, making such tests
unnecessary.  If their presence is inevitable, as Shimada asserts, then it is
better for legal and humanitarian reasons that they be legal rather than
illegal, which is what gives rise to proposals for managing foreign
workers.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Neither the traditional immigration countries of North America nor the
guestworker countries of Western Europe have managed to find a happy compromise
between wanting foreign workers but not foreign residents.  This book in
several places says that "just a little more effort" to open the work-and-learn
program to "hundreds of thousands" of unskilled foreign workers will enable
Japan to succeed in managing migration.</tt><p>

<tt>There was a 30 percent increase in tuberculosis patients in Malaysia in

blame the increase in foreign workers on the increasing number of persons with
communicable diseases. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A team of Malaysian doctors inspected 70 clinics in Bangladesh and found
that none were conducting medical tests that meet Malaysian requirements, and
some clinics were selling medical certificates to prospective job seekers.  The

immigrants.  Some Malaysians argue that the Indonesians do not want to spend
money on housing, since they aim to remit 50 percent of their earnings to
Indonesia.</tt><p>

Zealand's Business Migrants Not Creating Jobs</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>New figures released by the Immigration Department on June 6, show that the
majority of business immigrants are investing their money in banks, government
stocks or bonds and real estate.  The Immigration Department figures indicate
that of the 285 million NZ dollars (US$165 million) brought to New Zealand by
business immigrants since November 1991, 255 million (US$148 million ) are
destined for passive investments.  A business immigrant is required to invest
at least 500,000 NZ dollars (US$290,000) and the money must remain in New
Zealand for at least two years.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The New Zealand Immigration Services released figures on June 11, showing
that the number of immigrants to New Zealand from South Africa increased by 17
percent over the past three years.  South Africa, with 4,044 immigrants
arriving between April, 1993 and April, 1994, is now the second largest source
of immigrants after Britain, with 4,646 over the same time period.  The number
of immigrants from South Korea soared 700 percent, from 424 in 1991-92, to
3,506 in 1993-94. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC27">Australia:
Immigration and Housing</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Australia has announced an immigration quota for 1994 of 86,000, which
includes the conversion of 8,300 Chinese students into immigrants.  Immigration
to Australia is down sharply despite the fact that the economy is booming--the
1994 quota is less than half the 1988 peak of 173,000.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are several reasons why Australia is reducing immigration (MN, June
1994).  Unemployment remains at 10 percent.  Asians rather than Europeans are
arriving--43 percent of 1992-93 immigrants were from Vietnam, the Philippines,
and Hong Kong, and other Asian nations.  Australia abandoned its "white
Australia" immigration policy in 1972, but there seems to be some backlash
against the rising proportion of Asian immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry, the Australian
government's adviser on housing, has said that the long-term demand for housing
is affected by demographic factors, including immigration.  The IPC's most
recent report states: "The level of immigration, which at present is
contributing less than half of total population growth, is a particularly
important determinant of the long-run trend in the demand for housing."  A
higher level of  immigration will lead to a substantial increase in demand for
housing and household formation. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Housing Industry Association uses a rough "rule of thumb" that 3,000 to
3,500 houses must be built for every 10,000 immigrants who arrive in Australia.
There are variations by type of immigrant-- family unification immigrants are
more likely to live with a family rather than buy their own house immediately.
Business migrants, on the other hand, will likely have more resources at their
disposal and obtain housing immediately upon their arrival. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Bureau of  Immigration  and Population Research reported this year that
"by adding to excess demand for low-priced homes and cheap rental accommodation
on inner and middle suburbs, it may be argued that immigrants have inflated
rental and property values."  However, "if  immigration  stimulates economic
development, proportionally fewer people will be poor and redevelopment becomes
economically more feasible...."</tt><p>

<tt>The Zentrum f&uuml;r Sozialpolitik, Uni Bremen, Parkallee 39, D-28209
Bremen has several working papers on immigration and integration issues in
Germany.  Thomas Faist, in <u>How to Define a Foreigner?  The Symbolic Politics
of Immigration in German Partisan Discourse, 1978-1992</u> (12/93) explains how
German politicians have been able to maintain that the country was not an
immigration country even as immigrants poured in.  If Germans who were expelled
from the east are included, then 18 million "immigrants" arrived in the former
West Germany between 1945 and 1989, versus 16 million immigrants to the US
during this period.  Political parties knew that voters thought too many
immigrants were in Germany, and they advocated hard to enforce symbolic
policies to stop migration and promote returns and at the same time encourage
integration.  This turned immigration into a meta issue, in which immigrants
became the symbols of an overstretched welfare state and high
unemployment.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>According to Faist, the CDU-CSU began to use anti-immigrant sentiments to
gain votes in the early 1980s.  Party differences were sharpened in 1992, when
the SPD agreed with the  CDU-CSU-FDP coalition government that the Constitution
had to be amended in order to reduce the influx of asylees.  The SPD is now
pushing for dual citizenship, which the CDU-CSU-FDP government opposes.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Working paper 13/93, <u>Boundaries of National Welfare States:  Immigrants
and Social Rights</u>, includes a useful table comparing the access of various
categories of immigrants to pensions, welfare, and work-related benefits.
Germany generally provides more access to legal immigrants and refugees, but
fewer benefits to illegal aliens--in Germany, for example, illegal alien
children are not entitled to free public education as in the US and, since
children born in Germany are not automatically German citizens, they can not
lead to welfare benefits for the family, as in the US.</tt><p>

<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Gruter Institute for Law and Behavioral Research has announced it will
focus on three issues: human migration, security and risk, and sex and gender.
The Gruter Institute is a small California foundation whose work is motivated
by the belief that rapid advances in the biology of human behavior have
important implications for the law and the social sciences.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Evolutionary biology is the basis for the Institute's work.  Biology
distinguishes between proximate cause--such as how birds stake out territory
for mating--from ultimate cause--why they stake out territory.  The unifying
principle is natural selection--the notion that the goal of all living
organisms is to maximize their Reproductive Success (RS), and that the species
around us reflect the differential success of individuals in Reproductive
Success.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Evolutionary biologists observe the behavior of animals, insects, and
humans, and interpret what they observe under the assumption that each organism
is trying to maximize its RS.  There is thus a deal of interest in territory
and hierarchy--how each individual and group defines its home space and
maintains order.  Cooperation and competition can be observed in the individual
and group interactions observed.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some economists believe that evolutionary biology may fill an important
lacuna in economic theory--why do individuals have the tastes that they do?
Assuming that social individuals are in competition to achieve RS, but require
cooperation to survive and prosper, they note that society must develop rules
to identify and remove cheaters, especially in heterogeneous societies in which
there are continuing interactions.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Evolutionary biologists believe that their theories can explain complex
human behavior, but many of their insights about human behavior arise from
animal observation.  RS strategies can be observed in individual and group
interactions.  </tt><p>
<tt>There is always uncertainty about how another individual will react to
altruism and stinginess, and most species have evolved strategies that avoid
mutually disadvantageous behavior.  The most common interactive strategy is
tit-for-tat--favors and cooperation are rewarded by more of the same, and
deception or rejection is followed by the same response.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>An evolutionary biology approach may help to illuminate why immigration is
controversial in industrial countries.  Some evolutionary biologists consider
RS a more fundamental explanation for migration than the familiar trio of
family, safe haven, and economic opportunity.  Evolutionary biology would add
RS--some consider even more fundamental--to this trio of reasons for migration.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Evolutionary biologists note that uncertainty and insecurity among natives
can lead to anti-immigrant behavior.  This would imply that those who are
unemployed and poor would tend to oppose immigrants more than those who are
secure and affluent, and that anti-immigrant attitudes would be strongest if
the immigrants are different in appearance or behavior.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Perhaps the best summary statement of the RS approach to human behavior is
that "biology matters."  However, just as in the long-running debate over
whether fiscal or monetary policy is most effective in spurring economic
growth, so the effects of nature and nurture interact in human and social and
political life.  An understanding of the biological imperatives that undergird
human behavior should enrich our understanding of complex human behavior,
including migration. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC2">Haitian
Zig-Zags</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Clinton administration spent the month of July fine-tuning its policy on
Haitian refugees.  At the end of July, the US was on the verge of obtaining UN
Security Council permission to invade Haiti and restore President Aristide to
power.<p>
<p>
Haitians have been leaving their country in small boats for years.  Since 1981,
Haiti has allowed the US Coast Guard to stop boats in Haitian and international
waters to determine whether they were carrying Haitians to the US.<p>
<p>
The US has followed a zig-zag path on its treatment of "Haitian boat people."
On June 16, the US announced that henceforth Haitians picked up at sea and
seeking asylum would be eligible to present to US asylum officers on board US
ships evidence that they face persecution in Haiti.  As a result, over 11,627
Haitians were picked up by the US Coast Guard by July 6--many hoped that they
would be granted refugee status and allowed to go to the United States.  Those
turned down, about 70 percent of those requesting asylum, continue to be
returned to Haiti.  <p>
<p>
Clinton changed the policy on July 5.  After that date, Haitians picked up at
sea were sent to the US base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to present their case for
asylum.  If they were deemed in need of safe haven, they were sent to safe
haven camps, but not to the US.  Most nearby Caribbean nations have refused to
provide safe haven for Haitians.<p>
<p>
After the Clinton administration stopped shipboard hearings for refugees in
mid-July, the number of Haitians picked up by the Coast Guard dramatically
dropped.  The week of July 16, not a single Haitian was picked up, compared to
the 1,340 people picked up the previous weekend.  The decline was attributed to
a number of factors including choppy seas and soccer's World Cup.  Another
factor was that word was reaching the interior that refugees intercepted at sea
will no longer be able to settle in the US.  Members of the clergy and relief
organizations also report the Haitian government is attempting to staunch the
flow of refugees.  The relief workers say that this has meant an increase in
repression, especially in the coastal towns from where the refugees leave. <p>
<p>
In mid-July, there were 16,500 Haitians at Guantanamo, and a few hundred began
to trickle back to Haiti after they learned that, even if they could prove they
needed safe haven, they would not be going to the US.  Haitians who return to
Haiti are interviewed by Haitian immigration authorities and given money to
return home by the Haitian Red Cross.<p>
<p>
The Clinton Administration is scrambling to find places to house the Haitians
who have been deemed in need of safe haven.  Panama's President Guillermo Endra
first agreed to allow the United States to admit 10,000 Haitian refugees then
later rescinded his approval.  Panama planned to allow the Haitians to enter
Panama on a temporary basis, until a change in the current Haitian government
or a time period not to exceed one year, but bowed to internal pressure not to
allow any Haitians in the country.  On July 25, Honduras announced that it
would shelter up to 40,000 Haitians temporarily in exchange for increased US
aid.<p>
<p>
This zig-zagging Haitian policy prompted a spate of critical reviews of US
refugee and asylum policies.  Most began with the 22 words in the 1951 Geneva
Convention on Refugees--an alien who can prove that he or she faces "a
well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion,
nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion"
should enjoy <u>nonrefoulement</u> in a safe country--the right not to be
returned to danger.<p>
<p>
US law applies this standard to two kinds of persons in danger of persecution
in their country of citizenship.  Refugees are outside the US, and they seek to
enter because of the dangers they face at home, and asylum seekers or asylees
arrive in the US and ask to stay because of danger at home.<p>
<p>
The problem, according to critics, is that the US does not apply these
standards consistently.  There are about 19 million refugees worldwide, and the
US establishes a worldwide limit annually on the number it will accept each
year--121,000 in FY94.  The distribution of refugees admitted to the US
reflects domestic political considerations rather than the worldwide
distribution of persons needing safety from persecution.  In 1993, 41 percent
of the refugees admitted to the US were Jews or Evangelical Christians from the
former USSR, and 32 percent were from Vietnam and Laos.  Many of these refugees
are admitted after they show that they face a lesser "credible" fear of
persecution rather than the "well-founded" fear in the Geneva Convention.<p>
<p>
Once admitted to the US, refugees receive public assistance and health care
services at rates paid by the state in which they live.  States are reimbursed
for up to eight months of assistance, even though a majority or e.g., southeast
Asian refugees in California, receive public assistance for more than five
years.<p>
<p>
Asylum policy is even more controversial.  In 1993, just over 10,000 asylum
applications were filed each month by aliens in the US --113, 290, including 31
percent from Guatemala, 13 percent from El Salvador, and 12 percent from China.
Each application can be for a family--the number of persons represented by
these applications is almost twice the number of applications.  There are over
400,000 asylum cases that have not yet been processed, representing some
700,000 to 800,000 persons, and US courts routinely order the INS to reconsider
applications from particular countries because of what the court considers to
be "biases" in the consideration of applications.<p>
<p>
To apply for asylum, persons fill out an INS form, and then, in most cases,
asylum applicants are given work permits and told to keep the INS informed of
their current address so that they can be called to an INS hearing to prove to
an asylum officer that they face persecution at home.  The INS has switched to
a last-in , first-out policy--deciding current applications first, but this
means that some asylum applications are more than three years old.  <p>
<p>
Cuba and Haiti represent stark contrasts in US policy.  All Cubans who reach
the US can become immigrants.  On July 1, 1994, a group of 140 Cubans, the
largest boatload to arrive in a decade, sailed into Miami Beach.  The
continuing deterioration of the Cuban economy has caused a dramatic increase in
arrivals from Cuba.  In June 1994, the US Coast Guard rescued 1,173 Cubans, six
times more than they rescued in June, 1993.  <p>
<p>
Haiti, by contrast, is the only country for which the US insists that persons
fleeing persecution apply within the country of persecution.  Since February
1992, some 59,000 Haitians filled out preliminary questionnaires for themselves
and/or their families.  About 17,000 of them were interviewed in Haiti by US
asylum officers, and 4,000 were deemed in danger and admitted to the US.<b><u>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Commission
Recommends Better Verification</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Commission on Immigration Reform  (CIR) is expected to release its first
recommendations in testimony before the Senate Judiciary's Immigration
Subcommittee on August 3, 1994, ahead of its scheduled interim report in
September.  CIR concluded that the employer sanctions system established in
1986 by IRCA has failed.  The current requirement that newly-hired employees
present identification that proves their identity and their right to work in
the U.S., and that both the employer and employee sign an I-9 form as evidence
of compliance, has failed, the Commission concluded, because illegal alien
workers are routinely presenting false documents and securing jobs.<p>
<p>
The CIR recommends "a comprehensive strategy to deter unlawful immigration, in
part through measures designed to make it more difficult for illegal immigrants
to obtain work in the United States."  CIR believes that this strategy should
include retaining the existing I-9 system, but issuing all workers a
credit-type Social Security card that would also include other personal
information, such as date of birth and perhaps a fingerprint.  Employees would
have to present their "Employee Verification Registration" cards when hired,
and employers could swipe them through authentication terminals that would
verify the SSN and permit the employer to ask one or two personal questions to
determine whether the new hire is presenting his card, or call an 800 number to
verify the card number and assure that the person was presenting his/her
card.<p>
<p>
The proposed verification system would be similar to the current Systematic
Alien Verification Eligibility (SAVE) system that is used to determine whether
non-U.S. citizens who apply for public assistance are eligible legal
immigrants.  However, the SAVE system has a high error rate--in more than five
percent of the cases, identification numbers submitted for verification are
first reported to be false when they are in fact valid, in part because of lags
in issuing numbers and entering them in the verification database.  To avoid
having such "false negatives" lead to employers rejecting legal workers,
employers could not refuse to hire a worker until a second check confirmed that
the number was indeed false.<p>
<p>
In addition to preventing illegal immigration by denying jobs to those who
arrive legally, but then violate the terms of their visas by overstaying and/or
working--the case of the majority of the four million illegal immigrants in the
US, according to INS calculations--the CIR is expected to discuss the access of
legal and illegal immigrants to public services.  CIR chair Barbara Jordan has
noted that, in her opinion, "Illegal immigrants are not entitled to benefits,"
and that many of California's immigration problems are due to inadequate
enforcement of federal immigration laws.  The CIR is aiming at consensus
recommendations from its eight members. <p>
<p>
The CIR's proposal raised a storm of protest when it was leaked to the press in

Los Angeles Times Calls For A New Bracero Program</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
In a July 18, 1994 editorial, the Los Angeles Times recommended "a treaty to
legalize and then regulate the flow of Mexican workers into--but also
eventually out of--the United States."  The Los Angeles Times acknowledged that
its proposal is likely to be controversial, since the Bracero program, under
which almost five million Mexican workers entered the United States to do
farmwork between 1942 and 1964, was cursed for hurting US farmworkers and
sowing the seeds in Mexico for today's illegal immigration.<p>
<p>
The editorial has a
we've-tried-everything-to-control-illegal-immigration-and-failed-flavor.  The
Los Angeles Times recounted the corruption in the Tijuana section of the
Mexican immigration service--the director and two deputies were dismissed for
helping to smuggle non-Mexicans into the US-- and the widespread support in
California for proposals to deny public benefits to illegal aliens.  According
to the editorial, a "North American Free Labor Agreement" could deal with 50 to
60 percent--the Mexican part-- of the illegal alien influx into the US in a
constructive manner.<p>
<p>
Columnist Joel Kotkin echoed this call for a guestworker program by arguing
that immigrants in the US can be divided into intending citizen-settler and
intending guestworker-sojourner categories.  Instead of debating rights and
services for all immigrants, Kotkin argues that "newcomers who ultimately seek
to become citizens should be treated differently from those who plan to return
to their homes."  Guestworkers should have restricted access to public
services, and "their residency should be exclusively tied to their employment
status."<p>
<p>
Kotkin's argument is based on avoiding the deepening of what he calls a
"parallel society" of non-citizens.  He argues that if illegal border crossing
can be curtailed, and if employers who want to hire guestworkers could be made
to pay them decent wages and be "responsible for their medical as well as
education needs," there would be a built in bias in favor of younger
guestworkers.  If such sojourners came to the US without their families, then
they would make few demands on US public services.<p>
<p>
The contradiction in these proposals is that they assume on the one hand that
illegal immigration cannot be stopped, so that legal admissions are preferred
to illegal status.  However, they acknowledge that, before US employers can be
persuaded to hire legal guestworkers and cover the housing and related costs of
the workers temporary employment in the US, illegal immigration must be
controlled.  <p>

California Update</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
 "Save Our State'' Initiative Qualifies<p>
<p>
California voters will have a chance to vote on the "Save Our State''
Initiative--Proposition 187--on November 8, 1994.  If approved by voters, no
person -- citizen, legal immigrant or illegal immigrant -- "shall receive any
public social services to which he or she may otherwise be entitled until the
legal status of that person has been verified."  These public services include
public education, including higher education, and health care, except for
emergency health care.  Schools and hospitals would have to determine the legal
status of clients if they expect state reimbursement.  If publicly-funded
service providers suspect that a person requesting services is an illegal
alien, they are required to report that person to the Attorney General of
California and to the INS.  <p>
<p>
In addition, SOS makes it a felony to manufacture, distribute, sell or use
false citizenship documents, and requires police to report arrests of illegal
aliens to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  <p>
<p>
According to the state's legislative analyst, California could expect to save
$200 million in public service costs if SOS were approved, and an additional
$1.2 billion in public education costs.  However, it may cost $100 million to
establish a system to verify the legal status of schoolchildren and other
beneficiaries of public services, and up to $15 billion in federal
reimbursement for California may be threatened if SOS were implemented without
modifying current federal privacy rights granted to schoolchildren and public
service recipients. <p>
<p>
The SOS initiative was reportedly begun by a Santa Ana accountant who lost $1
million to an illegal alien housing contractor who  kept his assets abroad.
Two former Immigration and Naturalization Service officials, Alan Nelson and
Harold Ezell, led the petition-gathering drive, and got the California
Republican Party to endorse the initiative.  Governor Pete Wilson announced
that he will vote for the initiative, and a recent Field Poll indicated that it
is favored by 64 to 27 percent by California voters, very similar to the 64-24
percent favoring the "three strikes" initiative.  However, 63 percent of the
survey respondents had not heard of SOS; the percentage above is based on
opinion after having the ballot summary read to them. <p>
<p>
Treasurer Kathleen Brown, the Democratic challenger for Governor, blasted SOS
as "mean-spirited and dangerous," and the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors voted 3-2 against endorsing the SOS initiative.  Mexican Ambassador
Gorge Montana protested that the California debate over illegal immigration is
fostering a stereotype of Mexicans as lazy and criminal.  California teachers
persuaded the 2.2 million teacher-members of the National Education Association
to oppose the SOS initiative so that its victory would not serve as another
Proposition 13-type wake-up call to the nation, and they promised $2 million to
oppose SOS.  Other opponents of SOS range from labor unions to the California
Farm Bureau.<p>
<p>
If approved and implemented, SOS would lead to an immediate challenge to Phyla
vs.  Doe, a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down a Texas law
excluding illegal immigrant children from public schools. <p>
<p>
Immigration continues to play a prominent role in California campaigns.  In the
US Senate race, Democrat Diane Feinstein on July 4 released a campaign
commercial that showed Mexicans crossing illegally into California, with a
voice-over reminding listeners that she supported more US Border Patrol agents
while Republican challenger Michael Huffington did not.  Huffingon responded
with an ad blasting Feinstein for signing an ordinance as mayor that made San
Francisco a sanctuary city and prohibited spending city funds to assist
immigration enforcement.  Several ethnic groups criticized Feinstein for
"scapegoating" illegal immigration, but she defended the ads and promised to
continue to speak out on the issue, reminding interviewers of her call to levy
a $1 border crossing fee to raise more funds to hire more Border Patrol agents,
as necessary steps to deal with illegal immigration.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Wilson's Immigration Legacy<p>
Many commentators have emphasized that the same California politicians who are
today calling for tougher immigration enforcement and federal reimbursement
took positions in the mid-1980s that contributed to illegal immigration. <p>
<p>
Governor Wilson's June 1994 trip to Washington to lobby for federal
reimbursement for the state's costs of providing services to illegal aliens
rekindled stories of Wilson's mid-1980s role in ensuring California farmers a
continued supply of flexible immigrant workers.  The major issue was whether US
farmers would, after immigration reforms dried up the supply of illegal
workers, have to obtain job-by-job US government approval of their need for
legal foreign workers, and provide each worker with a contract, as under the
Bracero and H-2 programs.  California growers preferred programs under which a
certain number of "free agent" foreign workers would be admitted to float from
farm to farm.<p>
<p>
Current White House Chief of Staff Panetta won the farmers' argument in the
House in 1984, and Governor Wilson won their argument in the Senate in 1985.<p>
<p>
There was massive fraud in the Special Agricultural Worker (SAW) ultimately
included in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.  About four times
too many aliens applied, and three times too many were made legal immigrants.
Mostly young and married men--but not their families--were legalized, so some
say that Wilson has been hoisted on his own petard, since as Governor he must
deal with the costs of the illegal immigration to which his efforts in the
Senate contributed.<p>
<p>
On July 15, 1994, California's bonds were downgraded to among the lowest of all
states.  The state's $57.5 billion budget assumes that California will obtain
$763<p>
million in federal reimbursement for the costs of illegal immigration in FY94,
and $2.8 billion in FY95.  Bond-rating agencies were doubtful that these
federal funds would materialize, so that California may have to borrow more
than the $7 billion it plans to over the next two years. <p>
<p>
Local Impacts of Immigration<p>
<p>
A small school district on the US-Mexican border was expected to be ordered to
repay $1 million in mid-July for enrolling students who did not live in the
district.  The staff of a local assemblyman videotaped students who lived in
Mexico crossing the border every day to board one of six buses the district
sent there daily, and eventually 300 students were expelled because they could
not prove that they lived in the district.  Under state law, students must live
within the school district's boundaries or receive a waiver if the local
district is to receive state payments based on average daily attendance.<p>
<p>
The controversy over illegal immigration in California can be seen in the
dispute over grocery bags in Marin County, one of the nation's richest counties
adjacent to San Francisco.  As part of a publicly-funded art project, grocery
store bags were imprinted with stories of children in the community.  One of
the children profiled on the grocery store bags was an illegal alien fourth
grader who recounted how he had used a coyote to be smuggled into the US from
Mexico.  Customers opposed to illegal immigration threatened to boycott and
picket the store if the bags were not withdrawn, and the store owner promised
to destroy the 40,000 bags.  In response to the bag furor, a few residents
promised to establish a college scholarship fund for the child.<p>
<p>
A recent study found that 67 of California's 456 cities had a Latino majority,
according to the 1990 Census of Population, and that 85 percent of these mostly
Hispanic cities had Latino mayors.  In March 1994, 253 Latinos were serving on
the city councils of 140 California cities, usually in small farmworker towns
such as Orange Cove and Parlier, or in Los Angeles suburbs such as Pomona.  <p>
<p>
Latino mayors and city council members represent 10 percent of all California
mayors and city council members, even though Latinos are 28 percent of the
state's 32 million population.  However, Latinos are only seven percent of
California voters, a fact attributable to the large number of Latino children,
the fact that half the Latino adults are not US citizens, and the tendency of
US citizens of Latino origin to not register and, if registered, not vote.<p>
<p>
These data raise the issue of whether Latino political participation would
increase if city council members were elected by district rather than at large.
Latinos have sued in several cities to replace at large with district voting.<p>

Illegal Immigrants Diverted to Arizona</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Some predicted that Operation Hold-the-Line in El Paso, Texas, and a steel wall
plus additional Border Patrol agents in San Diego, California, would divert
illegal aliens seeking entry into the US to less well guarded portions of the
Mexico-US border.  In Nogales, Arizona, there appears to be such a
diversion--apprehensions are up 60 percent in 1994 compared to 1993, and the
Border Patrol reports that Mexican migrants from areas near San Diego are
traveling nearly 400 miles east because they thought their prospects for
illegal entry were better in Arizona.  <p>
<p>
The arrival of smugglers and large numbers of illegal immigrants has been
changing life in the small towns on the border.  Many such towns are filled
with retirees who moved for the desert climate, and they lament the burglaries
and other crimes that seem to accompany illegal migration.  Sonora, across the
border from the city of 20,000 of Nogales, has 250,000 residents with over 100
US-owned maquiladora factories.  The Border Patrol is replacing a chain link
fence that can be cut with up to four miles of 10 foot military landing mats
that are welded together, and then angled into the US at the top, so that
aliens who are in the US cannot make a quick return to Mexico after committing
a crime.  These military mats have been used to construct a 14-mile fence on
the US-Mexican border south of San Diego.<p>

<a name="RTFToC7">New
Jersey Sues U.S. Government</a>
</a></h2>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>New Jersey on July 15, 1994 became the fifth state to sue the federal
government to recover the costs of providing services to illegal immigrants.
Suits have been filed by Florida, California, Texas, Arizona--New York and
Illinois are "lobbying" Washington, DC for reimbursement.  California Governor
Pete Wilson charged in last summer that almost 10 percent of the state's
spending went to provide services to legal and illegal immigrants, and that
continued illegal immigration represented an "unreimbursed" federal mandate.<p>
<p>
Most observers predict that, as a result of these lawsuits, the federal
government will provide some compensation to the states that host immigrants,
and that the federal government will also step up border controls.  Since both
responses are projected to be less-than-perfect solutions, the debate over how
much compensation to pay and how much tougher border controls should be are
expected to unleash a "100-year" debate on mass migration.<p>
<p>
Neighboring New York has kept the welcome mat out for immigrants, despite the
World Trade Center bombing and the Golden Venture's grounding off Queens with
300 illegal Chinese aliens.  According to local observers, New York Governor
Cuomo and Mayor Giuliani have resisted jumping on the anti-immigration
bandwagon because of its historical role as the port of entry for immigrants,
because the immigrants arriving in New York are diverse, and because they and
other political leaders have stressed the economic benefits of immigrants
rather than their costs.<p>
<p>
The Senate voted 52-44 on July  22, 1994 to give $ 350-million to border states
to reimburse them for costs of crime committed by illegal aliens, taking the
money away from U.S. peacekeeping dues paid to the United Nations.  There are
50,000 criminal aliens in American prisons.<p>

Immigration and Welfare Reform</a>
</a></h3>
<p>
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that eliminating welfare
benefits for legal and illegal immigrants would save $22 billion over five
years, more than the $10 to $18 billion than President Clinton's welfare reform
proposals are expected to cost.  In the 1990 Census of Population, 4.7 percent
of the foreign-born individuals, and 4.2 percent of the U.S.-born, received
some form of public assistance.  Two sub-groups of the foreign-born have
especially high rates of welfare dependency:  those who arrived as refugees,
and immigrants 65 and older.  In the 1990 COP, about 16 percent or 170,000 of
the refugees received public assistance, and 13 percent or 400,000 of the
elderly non-refugee immigrants received Supplemental Security Income (SSI).<p>
<p>
SSI payments for elderly non-immigrants are projected to cost $600 million
annually through the year 2000.  The Clinton administration hopes to reduce SSI
payments by lengthening from three to 10 years the time that (usually) adult
children of elderly immigrants can be responsible for their parents' support.
However, under current court decisions, barring poor and elderly immigrants
from SSI may shift the cost of supporting them to states, who are generally
prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment from discriminating against legal aliens
in the provision of many state-funded public assistance programs.<p>

Immigration and Balkanization</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Detailed analyses of 1990 Census data are reinforcing earlier suggestions that,
as mostly unskilled immigrants move into states and cities, unskilled Americans
move out.  This represents an historic change--at the beginning of the 20th
century, mass immigration led to greater racial and cultural mixing--the
melting pot.  The mass migration currently underway, by contrast, is producing
white flight and greater ethnic divisions.<p>
<p>
Demographer William Frey of the University of Michigan noted that most
immigrants move to seven states--California, New York, New Jersey, Florida,
Texas. Illinois, and Massachusetts-and usually to a few cities within these
states, such as Los Angeles, New York City, and Miami.  All these states,
except Florida, experienced a net outflow of poorer and less-educated US
citizens during the late 1980s.  As a result, Frey fears that the melting pot
theory will not play out well for today's immigrants.  Instead, there may be
conflicts between older, better-educated, and white US citizens, and younger,
unskilled, minority immigrants.<p>

Over nine million people have applied for the "green card" lottery.  From June
1 to June 30, the special program run by the State Department accepted simple
applications from foreign nationals residing illegally in the United States and
would-be immigrants living abroad.  The lottery program was established by
IMMACT in 1990 to "diversify" the pool of incoming US immigrants,  a response
to the surge of family-based immigration during the 1980s from Latin America
and Southeast Asia.  <p>

Of the 55,000 immigration slots available, 24,549 are earmarked for European
nationals; 20,200 for African nationals, and 10,251 for Asian and South
American citizens.  The only prerequisite for entering the lottery is that
applicants must have completed secondary school or have work experience in a
field requiring at least two years of study.  To apply, applicants write their
name, address, date and place of birth and the names of their spouse and
children, if any, on a blank sheet of paper.  Despite this simple process,
immigration lawyers and other advisors were charging aliens $10 to $800 to

<a name="RTFToC15">Citizenship
Applicants on the Rise</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
A record number of immigrants are seeking US citizenship; 425,000 immigrants
are expected to become citizens nationwide  in 1994.  The Los Angeles INS
office in 1993 surpassed New York as the major city of citizenship-- 500 and
600 immigrants filed citizenship papers in  Los Angeles ever day, nearly double
the number in 1992. <p>
<p>
Contributing to the rising number of aliens seeking citizenship are aggressive
citizenship sign-up drives by immigration advocates, who see the new citizens
as potential voters, and the INS, which is promoting citizenship.  INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner has said that, if more immigrants became US
citizens, it would help the nation to accept newcomers. <p>
<p>
There are other three reasons why citizenship is on the rise.  About three
million illegal aliens who obtained "amnesty" in 1987-88  become eligible to
apply for US citizenship in 1994-95;  the number of legal immigrants, who are
eligible for citizenship five years after entering the United States, rose
dramatically in the late 1980s and early 1990; and some long-term residents who
have not naturalized look at US citizenship as protection against the growing
anti-immigrant backlash.<p>
<p>
Only about 40 percent of all immigrants become US citizens.  Asians
traditionally have high naturalization rates.  About 60 percent of Filipino,
and 58 percent of Chinese immigrants, for instance, apply for US citizenship,
according to a study of immigrants who arrived in 1977.  In contrast, only 16
percent of immigrants from Mexico who immigrated in 1977 sought US citizenship
within 15 years.<p>

Plans to Attract Business Immigrants</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Canada has unveiled a ten-year program to attract more business immigrants from
Taiwan to help revitalize the economy.  Canada will begin to issue immigration
visas in Taipei for Taiwan investors by the end of the year.  Taiwan business
immigrants have contributed more than US $370 million to a Canadian immigration
fund in the past few years. <p>
<p>
About 42 percent of business immigrants to Canada in 1993 were from Taiwan, and
another 42 percent were from Hong Kong.  Currently, prospective Taiwan business
immigrants are required to apply for business immigration visas in a third
country because Taiwan and Canada do not have diplomatic ties.<p>

<a name="RTFToC18">Germany's
Lead on European Immigration</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On July 1, Germany replaced Greece in the rotating Presidency of the Council of
the European Union for six months.  The European Commission, the permanent
civil service EU body, is the only body that can propose EU-wide asylum and
border control policies, which the Council then considers.<p>
<p>
The German government plans to use its six months at the helm of the European
Union to pressure other member states to share the burden of refugees who have
been concentrated in Germany.  Over 425,000 refugees have arrived in Germany
from the former Yugoslavia, and although the German government does not expect
to be able to get other EU nations to share the burden of caring for these
refugees, they hope to make arrangements with other EU nations to help with
future influxes of refugees. <p>
<p>
A draft resolution on immigration cooperation was discussed at the July meeting
of the German ministers and a delegation from the EC.  The resolution says that
all member states should contribute fairly to solve the refugee crisis by
receiving asylum seekers, participating in humanitarian and peacekeeping
situations, or EU nations can share the burden by helping to finance the cost
of protecting asylum seekers in safe areas and neighboring countries.  The
proposal uses gross national product, population and other factors to determine
each member state's overall target contribution.  <p>
<p>
German Interior Minister Kanther announced that Germany would like to a "more
just" distribution of asylum seekers in Europe--three-fourths of the 572,000
asylum seekers in 1992 came to Germany.  Britain and other EU members have not
supported burden sharing in the past.  This less restrictive approach, plus
fears of an influx of refugees from Northern Africa, may help build consensus
within the EU. <p>
<p>
Germany also announced that during the second half of 1994, the EU Council will
follow up on a June 20th resolution of the EU Interior and Justice ministers to
restrict as much as possible permanent legal immigration, and to permit
temporary foreign workers only in exceptional circumstances.  The nine EU
governments that signed the oft-delayed Schengen open border convention have
announced that the last hurdle, the Schengen Information System (SIS), will be
operating in five countries by mid-October: the Benelux nations, France and
Germany. <p>
<p>
Germany on July 1, 1993 revised its asylum law to preserve a constitutional
right to asylum but to make it difficult for persons who passed through "safe
countries" en route to Germany to apply for asylum, and allowed Germany to put
the burden of proof on applicants from "presumably safe countries,". including
Romania, Bulgaria, Gambia, Ghana, and Poland.  The German Supreme Court is
expected to rule on the legality of this "presumably safe country" provision
later in 1994.  During the first half of 1994, 62,802 aliens applied for asylum
in Germany, one-fourth as many as applied in the first half of 1993.<p>
<p>
About 10,000 aliens continue to apply for asylum in Germany each month.
However, twice as many as before are being returned to their countries of
origin after their applications are rejected, currently about 3,000 per month.
A few asylum seekers have committed suicide rather than return.<p>
<p>
On June 21, the German Bundestag approved an expansion of the number and power
of the Border Police.  Their number is to increase to 29,000 by 1996, and
penalties on illegal aliens smugglers have been raised. <p>

<a name="RTFToC19">Foreigners
Still Under Attack in Germany</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
In his inaugural speech on July 1, 1994, German President Roman Herzog called
on his countryman to welcome foreigners, give citizenship to immigrants'
children, and not to get carried away by nationalist pride.<p>
<p>
In Magdeburg, a city of 300,000 in the former East Germany with 6,000
foreigners, German skinheads attacked several foreigners on May 12, 1994. The
foreigners sought refuge in a Turkish restaurant, and the police were
criticized for not preventing the ensuing brawl.  Three Germans were jailed for
up to three years for their role in the riots.  Foreigners Commissioner
Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen said that "a new high" in anti-foreigner violence had
been reached.  (MN, June , 1994.)<p>
<p>
The German newsweekly, Der Speigel, interviewed four foreigners who live in
Magdeburg, and they described a life of big and small insults, and threats that
encouraged most of them to stay home at night.  Most reported few German
friends, and described instances of Germans following them with baseball bats,
being treated poorly in government offices, assumed to be shoplifters in
stores, and distrustful that the police would believe their version of attacks
and threats.  Several noted that, under the East German government, foreigners
were not attacked.  However, few of the foreigners living in the former East
Germany wanted to return to their countries of origin. <p>
<p>
On June 26, 1994, an estimated 50,000 Turks living in Germany, demonstrated
peacefully in Frankfurt against the Turkish government's treatment of Kurds in
Turkey.  Kurds are 10 to 20 percent of Turkey's 60 million population, and the
Turkish group PKK is trying to create an independent Kurdistan in the
southeastern part of Turkey.  Many Turks in Germany are Kurds, and they have
demonstrated in Germany several times in 1994 against the Turkish regime. <p>

Immigrants in Italy</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On December 31, 1993 there were 987,405 foreigners living in Italy.  The
largest percentage were in Italy to work (34 percent), followed by family
reasons (15 percent), and unusual reasons, such as those fleeing civil war who
can work (14 percent).  In 1991, about 4,700 foreigners became Italian
citizens--4,300 on the basis of marriage to an Italian.<p>
<p>
In 1993, 1,646 aliens applied for asylum in Italy; one-third were Romanian.
Only 138 or eight percent were recognized as refugees, and one-third of those
recognized were Iraqis and Iranians.  However, there were an additional 26,617
nationals of ex-Yugoslavia and Somalia who were working in Italy on temporary
work permits who did not apply for asylum.<p>
<p>
In a effort to reduce the unemployment rate, currently 11.5 percent, the
Italian government in mid-July proposed changes to Italian labor law that would
allow employers to offer employees fixed period contracts, thus making it
easier to lay off workers.  Employers would also be allowed to pay below union
wages in areas of high unemployment.  If approved, the government expects these
measures to create 150,000 to 200,000 new jobs.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC21">Russia's
Foreign Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
There are 400,000 foreign workers in Russia, but only 200,000 Russians working
abroad, according to the Federal Migration Service.  There are up to 500,000
additional "transit migrants" in Russia--sometimes referred to in the Russian
press as "illegals"--such as Iraqis, Iranians, etc., who arrived in Russia with
tourist or student visas, and nationals of former USSR states as well as the
Chinese, who could previously enter Russia without visas.  Many hope to apply
for asylum in Western Europe, or be smuggled illegally to the US.<p>
<p>
Russia has concluded "bilateral agreements" with over 60 countries from Germany
and Poland to China and Greece under which Russian workers can go abroad on the
basis of (1) an individual employer-employee contract, (2) an
employer-to-employer agreement (under which the Russians remain Russian
employees while abroad), and (3) an intermediary-Russian worker agreement.  In
some cases, it appears that these agreements are with individuals from these
countries, such as an American who signs an agreement to import Russian
workers, but still has to obtain H-2A or H-2B visas to have them admitted.  An
estimated 60 percent of the 200,000 workers abroad are employed under
employer-to-employer agreements, and 20 percent each under the other two
methods of working abroad.  Russia screens and maintains a list of workers it
considers qualified by language or skill to work abroad--the list reportedly
includes "thousands" of names.<p>
<p>
About 70 percent of the 400,000 foreign workers in Russia are from the former
USSR.  Russian employers may hire foreign workers--initially for one
year--after they convince the FMS that Russian workers are unavailable.  The
system for regulating guestworkers in Russia was "decreed" by President Yeltsin
in December, 1993 and April, 1994, and there are as yet no data on employer
requests, approvals, and rejections.  However, the Moscow city government
recently requested and obtained FMS permission to import 5,000 Ukrainian bus
drivers to fill vacancies reportedly caused by long hours and low wages.
Employers are still being educated about the sanctions law.<p>
<p>
Russia is also grappling with transit migrants.  There are reported to be at
least 200,000 foreigners in the Moscow region, including 10,000 waiting to
receive refugee status, 25,000 ex-students, 40,000 Vietnamese and Chinese
ex-guestworkers, and 40,000 so-called "economic refugees" who entered Russia
illegally from countries that range from Nigeria to Afghanistan.   <p>
<p>
In 1994, 55 additional border control centers are to be opened, and persons
seeking asylum are to be housed in one of 12 new centers.  Decisions on
requests for asylum are to be made within three months, with one to five
percent likely to be recognized.  To reduce transit migrants, Russia has been
imposing visa requirements on formerly free entry countries such as China.<p>
<p>
Before its breakup, the former USSR had about 285 million people.  Russia has
about 150 million people--Russian and non-Russian--and there are another 25
million Russians living in the former USSR republics that are now considered
Russia's "near abroad."  Since 1990, some 2 to 4 million Russians and
non-Russians have moved to Russia--sometimes because of discrimination against
them in newly-independent CIS nations.  Some Russian politicians argue that the
most important migration problem is the threat of "millions" more migrants
moving to Russia as a result of "persecution" in the near abroad and because
Moscow offers comparatively better economic conditions.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>During President Clinton's visit to Latvia in July, there were
protests, mostly by Russians, against the what they see as discriminatory
citizenship.  Latvia, which regained independence in 1991 from the former
Soviet Union, grants citizenship only to citizens of the Latvian republic,
which was annexed by Moscow in 1940, and their descendants.  The Latvian
president last week sent back to Parliament for rewriting a bill which would
have restricted the chances of 500,000 Russians in Latvia from becoming
citizens.  <p>
<p>
Latvian nationalists say citizenship restrictions are needed because
immigration during the Soviet era means that ethnic Latvians have a tenuous
majority in the republic of 2.6 million people.  Non-citizens, about 800,000 in
Latvia, carry Soviet passports and, although they have permanent residency
rights, they cannot vote or buy land. <p>
<p>
Russians are leaving the Baltic nations of Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia.
Some 80,00 of Estonia's 500,000 non-Estonians have left since 1989 (Estonia's
pop is 1.5 million).  <p>

<a name="RTFToC22">Czech
Republic: Foreigners Fees Increase</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The price of residency permits rose on June 1 from 200 korunas ($US7) to 1,000
korunas (US$35), and foreign residents who fail to renew their permit face a
late fee of US$138 .  Those paying 1,000 korunas for residency extension stamps
may have to fork out another 1,000 korunas to receive a new residency card.  <p>
<p>
These fee increases are a signal for foreigners to become legal, says the
Finance Ministry.  The price jump was also justified to curb immigration,
particularly from countries of the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.  The
price hikes are only the latest move in a government crackdown on foreigners
overstaying their welcome in the Czech Republic.<p>
<p>
There are currently 28,000 legal foreign workers in the Czech Republic,
according to the director of Employment Services.  Most of the workers come
from Poland (8,900), the former Yugoslavia (1,700), United States (1,200),
Russia (1,600), Great Britain (900), and Germany (870)--these data do not
include an estimated 28,000 Slovaks.  <p>
<p>
The Employment Services Director reports that some experts estimate the number
of illegal workers at about 40,000.  He also observed that the foreign workers
do not endanger domestic jobs on the national scale, but they may have some
regional impacts.  Some private companies, especially in construction, prefer
to employ foreign workers because they pay them substantially lower wages. <p>
<p>
Some companies operating in the Czech republic, mostly from the Ukraine, are
importing workers from their home country.  The imported workers live in poor
conditions.  Ukrainians workers reportedly tolerate the poor conditions because
they can earn up to 50 times more in the Czech Republic than in the Ukraine.
<p>
<p>
In May, passport controls were introduced on the Slovak border after Bratislava
followed Prague's lead in slapping visa requirements on Bosnian, Montenegrin
and Serbian nationals to discourage them from working there illegally.<p>
<p>
Foreigners must have work and residency permits before they can work legally in
the Czech Republic.  Until recently the government ignored this rule, but in
1994, more companies are being checked to ascertain whether their foreign
employees" papers are in order.  Companies can now be charged for the costs of
deporting illegal workers.<p>

<a name="RTFToC23">Syndicates
Smuggle Chinese to US and Europe</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The UN Economic Commission for Europe reports that the number of asylum seekers
in Europe and North America declined to 720,000 people last year, a drop of
100,000 or 13 percent from 1992.  The decline is attributed to the tougher
asylum laws adopted by many member nations, which comprise Europe, the
Commonwealth of Independent States, Israel, Canada, and the United States.  The
number of asylum seekers declined in Western Europe and Canada, but in some
countries, such as the US, there was an increase. <p>
<p>
Criminal smuggling syndicates have reportedly organized a labyrinth of
international air, sea and land routes for human smuggling that involves
roughly 30 countries.  Smuggling people has become so lucrative for criminal
gangs that "it has replaced drug trafficking as the enterprise of choice."  <p>
<p>
China's economic growth and openness has spurred an exodus of tens of
thousands, mainly migrants from the coastal regions of South Fujian and East
Guangdong.  Poland, Hungary, and the Czech and Slovak republics, are primarily
used as transit areas to smuggle Chinese into Western Europe and the US.  The
syndicates are also using the countries of Guatemala, the Dominican Republic ,
Mexico and Belize.  According to some estimates, about 100,000 Chinese are
smuggled illegally into the US each year, and another 100,000 to Europe.
During the early 1990s, about 500,000 Chinese illegally entered Europe, the
former Soviet Union and North America.<p>
<p>
In 1993, the Russian Federation had its largest annual increase in migration
since World War II. Net immigration last year reached 430,000, with 920,000
people entering and 500,000 leaving. <p>

Great Migration</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
According to Chinese authorities, there are 130 million surplus workers in the
rural areas of China, and their number is projected to increase to 200 million
by the year 2000.  Surplus labor in the countryside and jobs at high wages in
China's cities and its southeastern provinces have set in motion an internal
migration believed to involve at least 50 million, and possibly 70 to 100
million internal migrants.<p>
<p>
In Beijing, there are an estimated two million "outsiders" seeking jobs in day
labor markets.  If chosen by an employer, workers are often overworked, and
sometimes fired without having been paid. <p>
<p>
The largest number of migrants is believed to be the 10 million in Guangdong
province, which surrounds Hong Kong, where they help to build and staff the
reported 5,000 factories under construction.  Rural migrants are drawn to urban
and coastal areas by wages that are two to three times what they could
farming--the construction, mining, and factory jobs that attract migrants pay
$1.25 to $1.75 per day.  However, many migrants complain of broken employer
promises and workplace exploitation, and both public authorities and criminal
gangs allegedly prey on the migrants, selling the women and children into
prostitution.<p>
<p>
The remittances sent home by migrants are seen by some as a way to transfer
wealth from richer to poorer areas of the country.  In one county in the
interior province of Sichuan, remittances of $138 million in 1993 exceeded the
value of locally produced goods, $115 million.<p>

Malaysian employers who hire foreign workers must show proof that they can
provide satisfactory housing for them.  If an employer cannot provide proof of
adequate housing for the foreign workers, the Immigration Department will not
approve the employer's application for foreign workers.  <p>
<p>
Also in July, the government decided that foreigners wishing to work legally in
Malaysia will have to undergo medical tests in their home countries by
Malaysia-sanctioned doctors.  The requirement was imposed after it was reported
that up to 30 percent of the foreign workers in the country have health
problems, and that doctors in some countries were falsely certifying the
workers to be in good health.<p>
<p>
The new requirement is an attempt to halt the proliferation of squatter
settlements in Malaysia.  Estimates of the number of foreign workers in
Malaysia range from 1 to 1.5 million in a country with a workforce of 8
million.  Most are working illegally.<p>
<p>
On July 8, the Federation of Malaysian Manufactures (FMM) appealed to the
government to lift the ban on the hiring of unskilled foreign workers in
manufacturing.  FMM reported that labor shortages were disrupting production
and posing financial problems for firms, since they lost contracts due to their
inability to assure delivery times for lack of labor.  FMM reported that most
factories were running at capacity and were unable to expand because of labor
shortages. <p>
<p>
Despite the freeze on hiring unskilled foreign workers, on July 7, Malaysia's
Rural Development Minister received Cabinet approval to recruit 17,000 foreign
workers for the rubber and palm oil plantations on a government-to-government
basis with countries in the region.  Rubber and palm oil plantations are
reportedly operating at half capacity because of the labor shortage, so that 30
percent of the 1.8 million rubber trees in Malaysia are reportedly untapped

Kong Residents Rush for Foreign Citizenship</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The residents of Hong Kong made a last-minute rush to obtain foreign
citizenship before China takes back the British colony in 1997.  About 42,000
people have applied for the last 13,610 passports Britain has made available
for residents of Hong Kong, the  last immigration slots left from the 1990 plan
to making available 50,000 British passports for key professionals to ensure
that they remained in Hong Kong until 1997.  <p>
<p>
These 50,000 immigrants receive British citizenship if they satisfy criteria
including age, skill, English language proficiency, community service, and
education.  Hong Kong residents were initially reluctant to apply because of
harsh criticism from China, and the feeling that anyone who took British
citizenship would be penalized in any post -1997 administration.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>First-round quotas for police, business, managers and service
professionals were not filled.  The second round has seen each class
oversubscribed.  There were 14 times the number of business professionals
seeking British passports as there are spaces.  Also oversubscribed are slots
for social workers, translators, interpreters, architects, planners, surveyors,
police and teachers. <p>
<p>
Twice as many emigrants returned to Hong Kong in 1993 as in 1992, reports the
Hong Kong Institute of Personnel Management.  Experts predict that the number
of returnees will increase until it peaks in 1997 or 1998.  The government
reports that more than 8,000 people returned to Hong Kong in 1992, after
obtaining foreign passports--some 500,000 Hong Kong residents are believed to
have foreign passports.  The typical returnee was a professional with a college
degree. 30 to 39 years old, male, and married with children.  Most migrants are
returning from Canada and Australia, which are struggling with recession and
unemployment.  A recent poll of the returnees found that 80 percent find it
"easy to get a job" but encounter problems finding housing. <p>
<p>
Immigrants from Hong Kong are no longer making Australia their destination of
choice.  Among the reasons Hong Kong residents are staying home is that Hong
Kong businesses are paying high wages for skilled professionals and managers
with language skills.  The Australian Bureau of Immigration and Population
Research reported that the number of Hong Kong residents arriving in Australia
from July to December, 1993 dropped from 4,358 to 1,667.  <p>
<p>
The number of Hong Kong people permanently departing Australia is also rising.
Departures from July-December, 1993 were 270 compared to 153 for the same
period in 1992.  The total foreign population in Australia at the end of May
was 363,000 compared to 320,700 for the same time period in 1993.<p>

apply under the various preference categories in order to receive permission to
immigrate during the current month.  <p>
<p>
There are 226,000 family-sponsored immigrant visas available annually.  In July
1994, for example, those wishing to immigrate as first preference family
unification immigrants--the unmarried (adult) sons and daughters of US
citizens-- could enter the US immediately except for those from Mexico--who had
to apply by June 25, 1993 to be eligible in July 1994--and those from the
Philippines (September 25, 1985).<p>
<p>
The longest queues were for fourth preference family immigrants--the brothers
and sisters of adult US citizens.  For most countries, those eligible to enter
in July 1994 applied 10 years earlier in 1984--25 years earlier in the case of
the Philippines.<p>
<p>
There are 143,000 employment-based visas available annually, and both
first-preference priority workers and second-preference professional can enter
without waiting.  Third-preference skilled workers can also enter without
waiting, but third-preference other (unskilled) workers must have applied in
1988 to enter in July 1994.  There are generally no waits for
special--including religious--workers, and none for investors.<p>

Asch, Beth J.(Ed).  1994.  Emigration and its effects on the Sending Country.
Available from George Vernez, Rand, 1700 Main St, Santa Monica, CA, 90407-2138.
<p>
<p>
This seven-chapter report includes a literature review and chapters on the
effects of emigration on four countries that send large numbers of immigrants
to the US:  the Philippines (by Edith Tan), Ireland (Cormac O'Grada and Brendan
Walsh), Dominican Republic (Howard Wiarda), and Mexico (Jaime Navarro).<p>
<p>
The report concludes that young, male, and married men predominate among
emigrants, and that emigrants tend to be better educated than the average
resident of the sending country, with some skills, and employed prior to
departure.  However, their skills were in most cases acquired through family
investments, so that their emigration does not represent a brain-drain loss to
government investments in education.<p>
<p>
The report concludes "that, on net, emigration has a positive effect on the
sending country."(xv).  In dealing with the 3 R's --recruitment, remittances
and returns--the report notes that emigration relieves unemployment and may
raise the wages of workers who remain behind; that remittances are spent
primarily on current consumption, but the multiplier effects of such spending
expands demand and creates jobs; and that returning migrants become productive
after about six months unemployment.  Thus , "policies restricting emigration
would not have a beneficial effect."(xvii).<p>
<p>
The report is apparently quite old.  There are surprisingly few references to
the US Commission for the Study of Migration and Cooperative Economic
Development, and the several volumes of case studies that it commissioned.  The
discussion is also flawed by outdated data, such as using 1975 stock data for
migrants in the Middle East.  This leads to a surprising table on p 18, which
ranks countries by the percentage of their population sent to the US in the
late 1980s.  The top 15 countries include the expected Dominican Republic, El
Salvador, and the Philippines, but also Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea.
But the list also includes the UK (ahead of Poland), and Germany--these
countries are included only because immigration pressures in the late 1980s
seem to be based on actual immigrants since 1950, and Germany accounted for
one-third of the 1950s immigrants.  Most US immigration data series stop in
1988, before the effects of 2.7 million legalized aliens show up in immigration
data.<p>

und theoretische Analyse der internationalen Wirtschaftsmigration im 19. und
20. Jahrhundert.  Darmstadt:  Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft.<p>
<p>
Koener sees international migration as a process that accelerates the
integration of the world economy.  He observes that thinking about migration
has evolved, from conceiving of it as mostly a group phenomenon to considering
it mostly a rational choice of individuals and households.<p>
<p>
In 19th century Western Europe, up to one-third of the population increase
emigrated as a result of push factors in Europe and pull factors abroad.  A
transportation revolution--steamships--and a network factor--professional
migration recruiters--combined with liberal emigration and immigration policies
to produce the Golden Age of Migration.<p>
<p>
After the two World Wars, emigration push forces in Western Europe diminished,
and immigration polices became more selective.  In Western Europe, temporary
workers--guestworkers--were admitted under bilateral agreements, and the
rotation principle that failed in Europe was adopted and more effectively
implemented in the Middle East after 1975.<p>
<p>
Koener is a development specialist, and his discussion of why emigration
countries failed to benefit from remittances and returns is instructive.  He
finds that, in most cases, there was too much brain drain and too little
flexibility in emigration country economies to absorb remittances for
emigration to prove a short-cut to development.<p>
<p>
The book concludes that because migration is a dynamic social process, its
outcomes can never be fully predicted.  The key is flexibility on all sides,
since the process of migration changes migrants, emigration areas, and
immigration areas.<p>

<a name="RTFToC2">Clinton
Reverses Policy on Cubans</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
President Clinton on August 19 announced a dramatic change in the 28-year old
US policy toward Cuban refugees.  Henceforth, persons from the island nation
heading for the US on rafts and small boats are to be treated as illegal
aliens, detained in centers outside the US, and not permitted to enter the US
unless they can satisfy the criteria for refugee or immigrant status
individually.  <p>
<p>
The US policy change was due to the rising number of Cubans arriving on rafts
and small boats--about 20,000 in August, including 3,000 per day on August
24-25.  Talks between Cuba and the United States to stem the exodus began on
September 1.<p>
<p>
Both the US and Cuba have been using migration policy as foreign policy
instruments.  The US put an economic embargo on Cuba in 1960 and, under the
Cuban Refugee Act of 1966, Cubans who arrived in the US were paroled or allowed
to remain and work legally, become US immigrants after one year of residence,
and apply for US citizenship after five years.  The US did not return to Cuba
even Cubans who used violence to escape. <p>
<p>
As economic conditions worsened in Cuba, Cubans began to slip out despite
Castro's efforts to prevent their emigration.  After several ferries were
hijacked in August by Cubans bound for the US, Castro accused the US government
of encouraging Cubans to use violence to escape.  In mid-August, Cuba
apparently began allowing Cubans to leave freely.<p>
<p>
Cuba seems to be using the flood of migrants as a lever to get the US to
negotiate an end to the economic embargo.  The US response has been to instead
tighten the embargo, which suggests that the US hopes that yet more pressure
will lead to a change of government in Cuba.  The US announced that the current
"mid-level" talks with Cuba will cover only "orderly legal immigration."  Cuba
announced that it would prevent those leaving Cuba from taking children with
them on rafts.<p>
<p>
After the policy change August 19, some 18,000 Cubans were picked up at sea and
taken to safe haven at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  There are
already almost 15,000 Haitians at Guantanamo.  On August 24, the US announced
plans to expand the tent camps at Guantanamo to hold up to 40,000 Cubans there.
Panama and Honduras promised to take up to 15,000 Cubans for up to 6 months.<p>
<p>
Cubans taken to Guantanamo will not be admitted to the US unless they qualify
individually for refugee or immigrant status.  The US has an interest section
in Havana that in 1994 granted refugee status to 3,000 Cubans.  US authorities
urged Cubans to seek refugee or immigrant status in Havana rather than risk
their lives setting out to sea.  Under a 1984 amendment to US immigration law,
the US agreed to allocate up to 20,000 immigrant visas annually to Cubans and,
under the 1990 IMMACT, this number rose to 27,845.  <p>
<p>
However, Cubans would have to compete with 3.4 million other foreigners who are
awaiting immigrant visas to enter the United States.  There is speculation
that, if Cubans were to receive special treatment yet again by receiving a
higher priority in the immigration queue, Asian-Americans may protest.<p>
<p>
Cubans are attempting to flee in response to the economic crisis in Cuba caused
by the sharp decrease in Russian subsidies and a poor sugar crop.  In 1994,
Australia is expected to replace Cuba as the world's top sugar exporter.  <p>
<p>
In 1980, during the Mariel boat lift, 124,769 Cubans migrated to the US in 159
days, usually via private boats that traveled the 90 miles from southern
Florida to the harbor in Mariel, Cuba.  The US is seeking to avoid another
Mariel--US Attorney General Reno warned private US boat owners in August that
they may be arrested and have their boats confiscated if they attempt to travel
to Cuba and return with Cubans.  However, private boaters are permitted to pick
up Cubans at sea who are in danger of drowning.  <p>
<p>
By some estimates, from 1 to 2 million of the 11 million Cubans would migrate
to the US if they could.  Almost one-third of the 36 million people in the
Caribbean live in Cuba, and there are about 1.5 million Cuban-Americans in the
US.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Commission
Recommends That States Test Employee Verification</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The bipartisan Commission on Immigration Reform (CIR) on August 3, 1994
recommended unanimously in testimony to the Senate Judiciary's Immigration
Subcommittee that a national registry of the names and social security numbers
of all persons authorized to work in the US be established to deter illegal
aliens from obtaining US jobs.  CIR Chair Barbara Jordan urged that the
registry be established immediately, and be used on a trial basis to check
newly hired workers in the states of California, Florida, Illinois, New York,
and Texas.  These states include 35 percent of the US population, and 80
percent of the estimated 4 million illegal immigrants in the US.<p>
<p>
The federal registry would include data from the Social Security Administration
and the INS.  Illegal aliens would be deterred in test states by registry data,
plus counterfeit-resistant drivers licenses, secure Social Security cards, and
telephone verification systems.  Implementing these immigration control
measures may require federal and state legislation.<p>
<p>
The CIR's proposal to tighten employee verification systems was praised by INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner and by senators such as Diane Feinstein
(D-California), who believe that illegal immigration must be brought under
control.  Press reaction was generally favorable; the CIR's proposals were
described in major papers as "logical steps" to regain control over illegal
immigration.  The registry proposal was denounced by ethnic and civil rights
groups such as La Raza and the American Immigration Lawyers Association as a
national ID system.<p>
<p>
The CIR also endorsed more border control efforts, such as Operation
Hold-the-Line in El Paso, Texas.  By flooding the border with agents, the INS
has sharply reduced attempted illegal entries in El Paso, and also reduced the
crime associated with youthful illegal entrants.  According to a report by a
team headed by Frank Bean of the University of Texas, long-distance illegal
migrants continue to attempt entry to the US, but not at El Paso.<p>
<p>
The popularity of Operation Hold-the-Line prompted Governor Wilson to propose
that a similar operation should be mounted on the San Diego-Tijuana border.
There is speculation that such an operation may be mounted by the Clinton
Administration to deflect support for Governor Wilson and the Save our State
illegal immigration initiative on the November ballot.<p>
<p>
The CIR asserted that illegal aliens should receive no benefits except for
health care in emergencies and public education for illegal alien children.
Public education typically accounts for more than half of the state and local
costs associated with illegal immigration, and state and local governments are
required to provide free public education under the 1982 Phyler vs. Doe U.S.
Supreme Court decision.  CIR Chair Jordan acknowledged the legitimate concerns
over the costs of illegal immigration in high immigration states such as
California, but denounced Wilson and the SOS initiative as unnecessarily
inflaming tensions over illegal immigration. <p>
<p>
The CIR is expected to issue its interim report on controlling back-door
illegal immigration by September 30, 1994, and then tackle issues related to
front-door legal immigration.  Among the issues to be addressed are immigrant
entrepreneurship---how many new jobs do immigrant businesses create, for whom,
and with what impacts on their communities--and immigrant family and civic
structures--do immigrant families strengthen "family values?"<p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Haitians
Begin To Return Home</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On July 31, 1994, the UN Security Council approved the use of force to restore
President Aristide to power in Haiti.  Troops from several neighboring
Caribbean islands have been training with US troops for an invasion and, by the
end of August, an invasion appeared imminent.<p>
<p>
The number of Haitian boat people dwindled after they learned that they would
not be given entry to the US, and in early August the US announced that the
16,500 Haitians in Guantanamo would stay there rather than be moved to safe
havens in nearby nations such as Suriname, Panama and Honduras, which had
offered to permit the US construction of safe havens for Haitians in their
territory in exchange for increased US assistance.  The US has spent over $160
million in 1994 on camps and processing for Haitians.<p>
<p>
More Haitians began to leave the tent city set up for them in the US's
Guatanamo Bay Naval Base than arrived by mid-August.  In the three weeks
preceding August 15, for example, over 1,000 Haitians returned, while the US
Coast Guard picked up only 300 Haitians fleeing their country in small boats.
Between mid-June and mid-August, over 5,000 Haitians returned to Haiti.<p>
<p>
The Haitian crisis has inspired calls for open borders.  On the editorial page
of the Wall Street Journal, a newspaper that has endorsed an amendment to the
US Constitution that the US should have open borders, a Manhattan Institute
affiliate asserted that "Haitians make great Americans" by increasing
productivity and holding down the US cost of living.  Even though today's
Haitians include many single men without family ties, "the long-standing
Haitian-American commitment to self-improvement" provides sufficient assurance
that they will successfully integrate.  <p>
<p>
However, in New York City, where half of the adult Haitians have some college
education, seven percent of the Haitian immigrants-- and 25 percent of
second-generation Haitians--are on welfare.<p>

<a name="RTFToC5">
Immigration and Politics in California</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The debate over immigration in California is rekindling interest in the role of
Latino voters in statewide campaigns.  Latinos are between 25 and 30 percent of
California's 32 million people, but they are only 12 percent of California's
registered voters, and they accounted for only about seven percent of the
voters in the June 1994 primary elections.  Latino State Senator Art Torres is
running for Insurance Commissioner, and the SOS initiative will be on the
November 7 ballot, so some hope that the Latino vote could decide close
races.<p>
<p>
Why are there as many Black as Latino voters in California, even though there
are four times more Latinos than Blacks?  Half of the adult Latinos are not US
citizens; a smaller-than-average-percentage are eligible to register and vote
than do so; there is a much-discussed lack of "charismatic ethnic leadership;"
and Latinos are not monolithic Democratic voters--typically 55 to 60 percent
vote for Democrats.<p>
<p>
Governor Pete Wilson has said he is likely to vote for the SOS
initiative--Proposition 187 on the November 8 ballot--but he has not yet
formally endorsed it, nor has he actively campaigned for its passage.  Wilson
has mentioned his support for the SOS provision that would deny free public
education to illegal alien children.  He has said that, if SOS is approved, he
would welcome a California lawsuit to challenged the 1982 US Supreme Court
decision that required states to provide free public education for illegal
alien children.<p>
<p>
Wilson has reportedly been more concerned with eliminating federal mandates
that require states provide services to aliens, and with getting the federal
government to reimburse states for the costs of providing those services, than
denying aliens services such as health care, as SOS would do.  SOS opponents
counter that Wilson's attacks on illegal immigrants created the atmosphere in
which SOS could be put on the ballot, and that he is now trying to look
"responsible" by using anti-immigrant rhetoric but not endorsing an "extremist"
initiative.<p>
<p>
On August 25, 1994, Wilson had a full page ad in the New York Times asserting
California had done what it could to deal with illegal immigration--requiring
proof of legal status to get a driver's license, prohibiting local governments
from enacting sanctuary laws, and sending the National Guard to provide support
services for the Border Patrol.  Wilson appealed to President Clinton to order
the Border Patrol to implement an Operation Hold-the-Line in San Diego, to have
the federal government take custody of illegal aliens convicted of crimes in
California, and to implement the tamper-proof national registry system proposed
by the CIR in California (see related story).<p>
<p>
For the first time since employer sanctions went into effect in 1987, the
former manager of a Los Angeles medical clinic was indicted on charges that she
repeatedly accepted false documents from illegal alien workers.  Leticia Ruiz
de la Cruz, 40, was charged with knowingly accepting false Social Security and
Green Cards from illegal workers hired to work in the clinics.  A disgruntled
former employee turned clinic documents over to the INS.<p>
<p>
In San Francisco, a state appeals court on August 15 ruled that unauthorized
aliens who are eligible for emergency medical services and pregnancy care may
be required to confirm their illegal status when they seek such care.  IRCA
made unauthorized aliens eligible for such medical services, and California has
estimated that the cost of providing mandated health services to 317,500 aliens
is $395 million annually, or $1250 each.  <p>
<p>
The court ruled that the California rule requiring applicants for medical
services to declare their legal status does not conflict with federal law,
because even after they are identified as illegal aliens, they receive
services.  However, if SOS were approved and implemented, all government
employees would be required to inform INS of unauthorized aliens.<p>
<p>
In San Diego County, the Board of Supervisors voted 4-0 to cross check voter
registration lists with INS records to determine if non-US citizens have
registered to vote.  Under US law, persons registering to vote do not have to
show proof of citizenship; they need only sign an affidavit that they are
citizens.  Non-citizens who register can be prosecuted for perjury.<p>
<p>
In a July 12-17 Field Poll, illegal immigration was the 15th most important
issue for California voters, but it was more important to older voters, men,
and was the third most important issue for Republicans.<p>
<p>
On August 5, 1994, the US District Court in San Francisco ruled that a Chinese
citizen Seventh-Day Adventist who had lived in Hong Kong for 12 years before
immigrating to the US could not apply for asylum here because he was "firmly
resettled" in Hong Kong.  Mr. Chan applied for asylum in the US  because he
feared religious persecution after the Chinese assume control of Hong Kong in
1997.  The INS denied his application because he had "firmly resettled" in a
third country prior to coming to the United States.  The court upheld the INS
denial, noting that Chan and his wife owned property in Hong Kong. <p>
<p>
The District Court found that the INS has broad rule-making authority pursuant
to the Refugee Act of 1980.  The court said that since the INS could use its
discretionary authority to consider resettlement as a factor in evaluating the
merits of asylum applications during litigation, then it could also make a rule
based on that factor. <p>

<a name="RTFToC6">Court
Decisions Changes INS Policies</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
As a result of a court decision, the INS will now take custody of aliens who
stowaway in ships or airplanes, and permit them to remain in the US while their
requests for asylum are considered.  Unlike illegal aliens apprehended in the
US, stowaways detected at air and sea ports are legally considered not to be in
the US, and the air or shipping company on which they arrived was responsible
for holding them until the INS decided whether they could remain or should be
returned at the carriers expense.  A shipping company sued the government for
the costs it incurred while holding Romanian stowaways for almost two months,
and a federal court of appeals ruled that the old INS policy of requiring
transportation companies to cover the costs of holding stowaways had not be
properly adopted.<p>
<p>
Under the new rules, the INS will permit stowaways to e.g., apply for asylum,
and then release them on their own recognizance.  If their applications are
rejected, the transportation company that brought them to the US is responsible
for the cost of transporting them home.<p>
<p>
In the closely-watched Golden Venture case, in which a Chinese freighter was
grounded off New York City in 1993, a Manhattan federal judge ruled that
Xin-Chang Zhang can claim asylum because of China's one-child policy.  The
judge ruled that executive orders during the Bush administration which say
China's one-child policy is a basis for US asylum overrides other court rulings
that conclude it is not.  The INS is likely to appeal the decision.  <p>
<p>
Another ruling is likely to have more of an impact.  The judge ruled that the
immigration courts improperly interpreted when an immigrant has legally entered
the United States.  Zhang's rights were curtailed because he was on US soil
when he was arrested.  The judge ruled that as soon as immigrants enter US
territorial waters, they have the same rights as an alien in the US, a ruling
that may affect US policies toward Haitian refugees.  The INS is expected to
appeal the decision.  <p>
<p>
The Clinton administration has decided to give refugee status to Chinese
immigrants who claim they will be punished for opposing abortion in their
homeland.  This would halt the deportation of many Chinese immigrants who say
they would be persecuted for resisting abortions or mandatory sterilization. <p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Texas
Sues over Costs of Illegal Immigration</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Texas joined Florida, Arizona, California, and New Jersey on August 3 in suing
the federal government for the costs state and local governments incur as a
result of providing services to illegal immigrants.  Except for the costs
associated with imprisoning and deporting criminal illegal aliens, the federal
government has resisted providing such reimbursement, saying that the states
have not been able to justify adequately the amount of reimbursement they are
seeking.  <p>
<p>
There was a wave of similar suits in the mid-1980s, before IRCA was enacted and
states were eligible for SLIAG moneys to cover the costs of providing services
to newly-legalized aliens.  The US Supreme Court in 1985 ruled against state
reimbursement suits; it suggested that the states use the political process to
secure federal funds to cover the costs of immigration.  However, in a 1992
case involving New York, the US Supreme Court indicated that it was willing to
have federal courts play a role in the argument over federal reimbursement.<p>

<a name="RTFToC9">
Five-year Low in German Asylum Seekers</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Since 1990, 1,209,965 foreigners have applied for asylum in Germany, including
438,191 in 1992 and 322,599 in 1993.  On July 1, 1993, Germany's asylum law was
amended to require that applicants from "safe countries" apply and then return
to their country of origin, and applicants who passed through safe countries en
route to Germany&nbsp;to apply for asylum there.  <p>
<p>
Some 161,492 foreigners applied for asylum between July 1, 1993 and June 30,
1994, but in July 1994, the number of applicants reached a five year low of
8,730.  There were 71,532 asylum seekers in the first seven months of 1994 and,
in July 1994, 7.6 percent of the 27,681 asylum applications considered were
approved.  The German Office for the Recognition of Refugees is being
streamlined to deal with a projected 25,000 asylum seekers annually.<p>
<p>
There is a remarkable optimism that the 1993 asylum reform  has "worked":
applications are down, and most cases are heard within three or four days.
With less than 10 percent of the applicants recognized as refugees during these
speedy proceedings, the word is getting out that it is not easy to obtain
asylum in Germany.  <p>
<p>
The almost 9,000 people monthly who continue to enter Germany and seek asylum
usually present no travel documents or written proof that they face persecution
at home.  Typical is a 32 year-old Iranian man who crossed the Iranian-Turkish
border on foot, traveled by car across Turkey, and then used a false passport
to fly from Istanbul to Frankfurt.  The passport was taken by the smuggler, and
this man entered Germany--if he had applied for asylum<b> </b>without documents
at the airport, he would have remained in an airport camp while the application
was decided.  This man allegedly faced persecution in Iran because of his
wife's support for dissidents there.<p>
<p>
Most such applications are rejected as "apparently unfounded."  Applicants
receiving such decisions are expected to leave Germany within one week--if they
do not, they can be deported--20,000 were in 1992, and 37,000 were in 1993.
However, many manage to delay their departure.  First, those without papers
must order new passports--and pay appropriate fees for them if they have money
-- from their countries' German embassies.  Some countries do not easily or
quickly issue replacement passports, and some asylum applicants allege that
applying to their country's German embassy or consulate subjects them to
persecution at home.  <p>
<p>
Second, those who arrived over land borders must admit to, e.g., crossing the
Polish-German border before Poland is obliged to take them back--few have been
returned so far to neighboring "safe countries."  Third, many of those whose
applications are rejected are nonetheless allowed to remain in Germany,
especially if there is a civil war in their country of origin.  For this
reason, applicants often purchase and present Bosnian or Somalian passports,
since applicants from these countries are often "tolerated" with  Temporary
Protected Status.<p>
<p>
Human rights organizations complain that applicants have only one to two hours
to tell their story, that "deciders" must make an average two decisions daily,
that rejected applicants have only one week to appeal a rejection, and the
courts just one more week to consider the appeal, and that applicants can be
returned in a step-by-step fashion to the country of origin they fled, e.g. an
applicant from Iran being returned first to Turkey and then to Iran.<p>
<p>
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther in mid-August reported that the number of
aliens apprehended on Germany's borders fell by half compared to 1993 to
20,000.  Most attempt to slip over the Czech and Polish borders, where Germany
has 4,400 Border Patrol agents.  The German Border Patrol has an annual budget
of DM 2.5 billion, or $1.6 billion.   <p>
<p>
According to a television network ZDF poll, one-fourth of the West Germans, and
11 percent of the East Germans, considered asylum seekers and foreigners to be
the top priority in Germany in July 1994.  By comparison, 56 percent of the
West Germans, and 76 percent of the East Germans, considered unemployment to be
the top priority.<p>
<p>
German's population rose in 1993 by 363,000 or 0.4 percent to 81.3 million.
There were 76,000 more deaths than births; the net immigration of foreigners
was 277,000 in 1993, versus 593,000 in 1992.  <p>
<p>
There continue to be more Germans----including ethnic Germans from the former
USSR--moving to Germany than emigrating.  In 1992, net "German" immigration was
195,000, and in 1993 it was 194,000.  Since 219,000 ethnic Germans arrived,
this indicates that 87,000 Germans emigrated.  In addition, there are expected
to be 20,000 illegal immigrants settling in Germany in 1994, versus 50,000 in
1993.<p>
<p>
In Buchenwald (in the eastern German state of Thuringia), 22 neo-Nazis stormed
through the concentration camp memorial in July.  Foreigners' Commissioner
Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobson joined the criticism of police and prosecutors in
their handling of the case.  According to government data, 82 identified
neo-Nazi groups were blamed for 2,232 acts of reported violence in 1993,
including 1,609 against  foreigners.  However, Schmalz-Jacobson said that in
1993 there were 6,016 racist attacks. <p>
<p>
For the first time since 1989, the number of crimes recorded in Germany
declined, from 2.6 to 2.5 million.  The number of foreigners suspected of
committing crimes fell by 10 percent between the first half of 1993 and the
first half of 1994., <p>
<p>
British construction workers in Berlin have accused neo-Nazis of attacking them
on their Saturday afternoon sweeps of building sites.  Gangs armed with
baseball bats go from construction site to site looking for foreign workers.
British construction workers reportedly earn between $12 and $17 hourly.<p>
<p>
In 1992, Germany and Vietnam negotiated an agreement to have German funds pay
to reintegrate the Vietnamese who had been recruited to work in the former East
Germany.  However, 40,000 Vietnamese remain in Germany, and many have applied
for asylum there.  Germany is trying to negotiate an agreement with Vietnam so
that Vietnam will accept Vietnamese who "voluntarily" return.  Over half of the
Vietnamese who applied for asylum in Germany have had their applications
rejected.<p>
<p>
The Economist magazine warned that Europe was sliding down a slippery slope of
creating an underclass because of long-term unemployment--40 percent of the 17
million unemployed in the European Union have been out of work for at least a
year; including a third who have never worked at all.  Many of the unemployed
are immigrants or their children-- in the former West Berlin, the number of
unemployed foreigners nearly doubled between 1989 and 1993, while the
unemployment rate for ethnic Germans rose by less than one third.<p>
<p>
In early August, fundamentalists in Algeria killed five French citizens, and
France accused Germany of not being strict with Algerian fundamentalists who
live there.  Rabah Kebir, a fundamentalist Algerian FIS leader who was granted
asylum in Germany, was thought to have violated the terms of his stay in
Germany by making political statements and by illegal traveling to France.  On
July 24, 18 Algerian and other North African asylum seekers being held in a
camp in Kassel took several guards hostage.  Algeria has refused to accept its
nationals who have had their applications for asylum in Germany rejected.<p>

in Illegal Immigration to Czech Republic</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Czech Republic reports that the number of illegal immigrants apprehended on
its borders has fallen from 5,000 in January to less than 1,000 in June.  The
decline was attributed to new visa requirements for nationals of the former
Yugoslavia, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Tajikistan,
and stricter measures implemented by Germany.  Over 88 percent of those
apprehended were Europeans.  <p>
<p>
More than 35,738 people have been denied entry to the Czech Republic in 1994<b>
</b>because of incomplete travel documents.  There is organized smuggling of
aliens by Czechs, Slovaks and Yugoslavs along the Czech-German border, usually
involving men of working age. <p>
<p>
The Czech Republic is hoping to sign an agreement that would require German
officials to return illegal migrants within 72 hours of crossing, instead of
the current seven days.  The Czech Republic also hopes to receive financial aid
from Germany to improve its border control capabilities, such as improved
communications and vehicles. <p>

EU Immigration Proposals Worry House of Lords</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The All-Party Committee of Peers has called for stronger immigration controls
at the borders of the European Union.  Meanwhile, the upper house of the
British Parliament asked for a revision of plans for an EU-wide visa law,
warning that the EU law might restrict the travel rights of many Commonwealth
citizens. <p>
<p>
The House of Lords Select Committee on European Affairs said a proposed list of
citizens who will require visas to enter the EU is too long and includes many
nations of the Commonwealth, such as India, Barbados, and Grenada, many of whom
do not currently require visas for short stays in Britain.  The Lords argue
that the EU has no power to require mutual recognition of visas by member
states, or list countries whose nationals are required or not required to have
visas to travel to the EU.  <p>
<p>
The draft proposal on a common EU visa policy is considered by some to be
another step toward "Fortress Europe," and by others to be the first step
toward a border-free Europe for all those inside EU nationals.  Police argue
that identification checks with a common database and compatible computer
systems are necessary to stop drugs, car thieves and terrorism. <p>
<p>
Island nations such as the UK and Ireland have traditionally controlled entry
with tight border controls, while continental nations such as Germany and
Belgium with land borders have supplemented border controls with internal

<a name="RTFToC17">Foreign
Worker Fees in Taiwan</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
There are 140,000 foreign workers in Taiwan, but employers have applied for and
been granted permission to import 200,000 to 300,000.  About 100,000 are Thais
employed in factories and in construction, and 25,000 are Filipino maids and
nurses.  Foreign workers can remain in Taiwan for two years, and specialists
for three--the government plans to extend maximum stays to three and four
years.<p>
<p>
The Council of Labor Affairs announced in August, 1994 that it was thawing the
recruitment freeze imposed in April, but also planning to increase the fee
charged to employers to import foreign workers--currently NT$2,000 or $77-- in
order to reduce their reliance on foreign workers.  For the first time,
households with children under six or persons over 75 would be able to employ
foreigners as domestics.<p>
<p>
Private employers have been permitted to recruit foreign workers since 1991.
Under the current program, Taiwanese employers must pay at least basic monthly
salary-currently NT$ 13,350 ($515), pay a deposit of NT$26,000 that is refunded
after the foreign worker leaves in two years, and pay a monthly<p>
"employment stabilization fee" fee  that is meant to protect the interests of
Taiwanese workers--in manufacturing, this fee is currently NT$1,300 per month.
Employers must enroll foreign workers in the labor insurance and health
insurance programs. Employers must also pay recruitment and transportation
costs, and bring the workers into Taiwan within six months of being granted
approval.<p>
<p>
The Chinese National Federation of Industries protested the plan to raise the
CLA fee, arguing that, with all theses costs, additional fees and lower
productivity would make foreign workers too costly.  Instead, they asked for an
additional 11,000 foreign workers to fill so called 3-D jobs--dangerous,
difficult, or dirty, a relaxation of the minimum monthly wage, and an extension
from two to three years for the workers stay in Taiwan.  Industries seeking
foreign workers include tires, rubber and rubber products, and construction.<p>
<p>
A survey of Taiwanese workers found that 82 percent agree that foreign workers
are needed under certain conditions, but two-thirds oppose the importation of
mainland Chinese workers.  However, 42 percent of those surveyed fear that
foreign workers may threaten their jobs.  Taiwanese fishing companies have
received permission to import up to 10,000 mainland workers.  Taiwanese
employers must notify labor unions about their hiring of foreigners, and they
cannot fire local workers and replace them with foreigners.<p>
<p>
Foreign workers headed for Taiwan must attend classes on their rights and
obligations under Taiwan's labor laws, as well as on Taiwan's culture.  While
in Taiwan, they are required to have  physical examinations every six months.
The most common violation of labor laws occurs when Taiwanese employers
encourage excessive overtime work, reflecting the employers' desire to use
relatively cheap foreign workers as much as possible and the workers' desire to
maximize their savings.<p>
<p>
The foreign workers' most serious problem is exploitation by labor brokers.
Foreign factory workers can earn NT$ 16,000 to NT$ 20,000--$700--per month, or
$20,000 over the two-year stay permitted in Taiwan.  Competition among foreign
workers to be selected for jobs in Taiwan is very keen, and workers are willing
to pay NT$ 70,000 to NT$ 80,000 --equivalent to four to five months wages--to
obtain a work permit.  Most workers sign IOUs and have this "recruitment fee"
deducted from their wages in Taiwan.<p>
<p>
To escape from these recruitment fees, or to earn a higher wage, some foreign
workers abandon their designated job.  They thus become illegal alien workers.
The Taiwanese government is considering a proposal to amend the Employment
Service Law to establish penalties of imprisonment of up to five years and a
fine of up to NT$ 1.5 million for the collection of "excessive" brokerage fees
or the illegal employment and abusive treatment of  foreign workers.  The
government is also establishing foreign worker assistance centers .<p>

<a name="RTFToC19">Development
and Migration in Asia</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Does freer trade increase, decrease, or have no effect on unwanted migration?
The U.S. Commission for the Study of International Migration and Cooperative
Economic Development<sup> </sup>established by IRCA in 1986 to deal with the
"root causes" of illegal immigration to the United States concluded that,
although free trade and investment were the best mutually beneficial policies
that emigration and immigration countries could adopt to accelerate their
development and eventually reduce unwanted immigration, such migration would
not be reduced quickly, and may even increase temporarily.  The prospect of an
unwanted "migration hump" in the wake of the "correct" economic policies to
accelerate stay-at-home development leads to a paradox--the same policies that
make immigration controls less necessary in the long-run make such controls
more necessary in the short-run, especially if one reason why immigration
countries implement free trade policies is to slow unwanted immigration.<p>
<p>
The OECD's Development Center held a seminar in July 1994 to discuss the
migration hump in successful (Korea, Taiwan) and failed (Philippines, Pakistan)
cases of economic development.  The successful cases were defined as those in
which previous net emigration countries became net immigration destinations
within a decade.  Most were in East Asia, and the "East Asian Miracle" of rapid
economic and employment growth that also reversed net migration flows was
attributed to the fostering of labor-intensive manufacturing industries that
created jobs and exported ever more sophisticated goods.  The absence of
segmented labor markets permitted the benefits of this export-led growth to be
shared, even by those not employed in manufacturing.  Rising manufacturing
wages also pulled up farm wages and incomes, there was less rural-urban
migration, less crowded urban labor markets, and less overseas migration.<p>
<p>
This seminar was significant because it represents one of the first attempts to
derive migration lessons from Asian Newly Industrialized Countries (NICs).  The
World Bank's recent study--The East Asian Miracle--demonstrates that Asian NICs
offer important lessons in how to manage developing economies in a manner that
promotes fast and equitable growth--they may also offer important lessons in
how to promote stay-at-home development.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Labor Migration in Asia</i><p>
<i></i>Asia, home to almost 60 percent of the world's population, has so far
not experienced the large-scale labor migrations that have moved immigration
and integration toward the top of the socio-political agenda in North America
and Western Europe.  However, uneven population and economic growth in the
region, combined with the recruitment of both professional and unskilled
migrant workers, the growth of tourism and labor smuggling, the toleration of
illegal workers, and rising expectations in job-short nations combine to
suggest that labor migration could change the face of Asia over the next
several decades.<p>
<p>
Japan, Korea, and Taiwan--the region's three major economic success
stories--are likely to become more dependent on foreign workers in the 1990s.
During pre-1980s economic booms, these countries were able to fill
newly-created jobs with baby boom workforce entrants, ex-farmers, and women
entering the labor force.  Today these reservoirs of additional domestic labor
have dried up, and foreign workers are becoming the workforce "shock absorbers"
for these economies in the 1990s.  All three countries are attempting to manage
growing numbers of foreign workers in a manner that prevents their
settlement.<p>
<p>
In Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, many foreign workers are employed in small
manufacturing firms--operations with less than 50 workers employ two-thirds or
more of the manufacturing workers.  These firms tend to offer 3-D
jobs--difficult, dirty, and dangerous--and, even though the small firms in
which many of these jobs are found in some cases pay wages comparable to large
firms, they often do not have the capital or the capacity to automate at home
or relocate production overseas.  Thus, the combination of a near empty
reservoir of flexible domestic workers, a still-significant small-scale
manufacturing sector, and constraints on the firms' flexibility combine to
create a demand for foreign workers.  In Tokyo in 1990, a survey found that 11
percent of all small manufacturing firms employed some foreign workers.<p>
<p>
Japan is in the midst of its second period of labor shortage.  In the
first--from 1965 to 1973--labor shortages were met through rural-urban
migration, automation, and investment overseas, and wage differentials between
large and small manufacturing firms narrowed.  During the second period of
labor shortages between 1986 and 1991, small manufacturing firms that had
already closed the wage gap with large firms, and could not longer find
ex-farmers to fill the 3-D jobs they offered, began to turn increasingly to
sidedoor and backdoor foreign workers.<p>
<p>
There are estimated to be 1.2 million foreign workers in Japan, including
400,000 illegal workers.  The type of foreign worker employed tends to vary
with firm size.  The largest firms tend to favor legal immigrants, such as
ethnic Japanese Nikkei from Brazil and Peru.  Mid-sized firms often look to
trainees--foreigners who mostly work and sometimes learn in Japan.  The
smallest firms--often subcontractors with fewer than 10 workers--are most apt
to employ illegal alien workers.  There seem to be few alternatives, in the
view of some, to importing foreign workers during today's labor shortages to
preserve the small firms that give Japan's manufacturing sector its
flexibility.<p>
<p>
Taiwan and Malaysia represent interesting cases in which managing migration is
a challenge produced by rapid economic growth--in other words, most countries
would much prefer to enjoy economic success and have to manage migration than
to stagnate and not worry about illegal immigration.  In Taiwan, export-led
manufacturing growth has improved conditions for the average worker, a clear
case of the Asian miracle, but left in its wake labor shortages that are being
filled by migrant workers, especially in construction and as household
maids.<sup> </sup> In mid-1994, there were almost 200,000 foreign workers in
Taiwan, making foreigners two percent of the country's workforce.<p>
<p>
Malaysia is the first Muslim country to industrialize, and the demand for
foreign workers there reflects both rapid economic growth and the slowness of
some economic sectors to restructure.  The Malaysian migrant worker dilemma
illustrates the challenge facing many fast-growing Asian nations.  As these
economies grow rapidly, productivity increases and wage growth vary by sector.
Manufacturing tends to generate the fastest growth in output and wages per
worker, and so the workforce--especially young women with some secondary
education-- "naturally" redistributes itself toward manufacturing. <p>
Manufacturing miracles may lead to labor shortages in agriculture and
construction, unless employers there raise wages.  But the wage increases
necessary to balance labor supply and demand in such traditional sectors may be
so high that commodity production may shrink, or the costs of
government-financed construction projects rise, so there is pressure to admit
"temporary" foreign workers--in Malaysia's case foreign workers are believed to
be at least one-third of the hired workers in agriculture, and two-thirds of
the workers employed in construction.<p>
<p>
Thailand represents a confused case of segmentation that permitted the
best-educated urban residents to reap many of the benefits of export-led
manufacturing growth.  Because manufacturing jobs are prized, and rural wages
are very low, Thai employers--unlike their counterparts in Malaysia-- can and
do demand that the young women they employ have more than a primary school
education, even if the jobs they fill do not seem to require this much
education.  Since 80 percent of all Thai workers have only a primary school
education, most are locked out of manufacturing jobs.  Labor-intensive
manufacturing growth in Thailand seems to be a case of concentrated benefits,
so that the distribution of income has become more unequal despite rapid
growth.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Conclusions</i><p>
<i></i>Asia presents the world with examples of rapid economic development,
simultaneous economic and employment growth, and ever-increasing international
labor flows.  The "Asian model" of export-led manufacturing growth is seen by
some as a beacon for developing countries elsewhere--if they adopt the Asian
model, they too, the reasoning goes, could expect average incomes to double
within a decade.<p>
<p>
It is hard to argue with success, but some participants felt that the Asian
model is not universally applicable.  Even within Asia, there are cases of
development failures as well as successes.  However, the Asian successes do
seem to argue for economic democracy--for spreading, first via jobs and later
rising wages, the benefits of one sector's growth throughout the economy and
labor force.<p>
The migration management lessons from Asia are less clear, largely because
there are not yet any generally recognized success stories.  Instead, Asian
countries so far seem to be making the same mistakes that were made earlier in
North America and Europe--opening sectors selectively to foreign workers, and
changing migrant worker policies frequently as the relative power of domestic
"let them in" and "keep them out" camps ebbs and flows.<p>
<p>
The Asian economic miracle has been recognized.  Asian migration remains an
unfinished story, with few clairvoyants willing to predict how it will
ultimately turn out.<p>

<a name="RTFToC20">Malaysia
Proposes Fines for Employers Hiring Illegal Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Under the proposed Recruitment of Foreign Workers Act, employers could be fined
up to RM 50,000 for each illegal worker employed, imprisoned for five years, or
both.  Currently, the Human Resources Ministry has no power to sanction
employers who hire illegal immigrant workers;  when the Labor Department learns
of illegal workers, they are referred to the Immigration Department.  <p>
<p>
There are an estimated to be over 1 million illegal immigrants in Malaysia,
including 800,000 Indonesians, 100,000 Filipinos, and 100,000 Bangladeshis.
Between July 1992 and June 1994, 104,920 illegals were apprehended in Malaysia.
Most are housed in one of eight detention centers--at a cost estimated at
RM500,000 (US$200,000) monthly--and eventually deported.  <p>
<p>
One company has proposed handling, for a fee, all aspects of the recruitment of
foreign workers, replacing the 822 licensed recruitment companies--300 of which
are currently active.  Some in government think that a single employment agency
would reduce illegal immigration by fraudulent employment agencies.<p>
<p>
A senior plantation leader lamented the alleged labor shortages on Malaysian
plantations, and argued that increasing their dependence on foreign workers
cannot solve the industry's problems because "foreign workers do not have the
dedication or the discipline."  Instead, he complained that plantations are
being used only as an entry point for foreign workers who want to enter
Malaysia's booming manufacturing sector.  <p>
<p>
However, the rubber manufacturers' association acknowledged that 25 percent of
its unskilled workers are foreigners, and 11 percent of its skilled workers,
and asked the government to clarify its foreign workers policy for factories.
<p>
<p>
Malaysia's largest company, Sime, has established the nation's first housing
estate for foreign workers in Subang Jaya.  At two workers per room, there will
be housing for 1,443 workers, who will pay RM 5.10 ($2) daily.  The housing is
fenced and has 10 security guards on duty 24 hours a day.  Identification cards
are needed to enter the housing.  Among the amenities are electricity from 7pm
to 7am daily and tap water 24 hours a day.<p>

<p>
There are almost 130,000 foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong, a sharp
increase from the 24,600 of 10 years ago.  Most are Filipinos--they are
preferred because they speak English--the others come from Indonesia, Thailand
and Sri Lanka.  <p>
<p>
There are many complaints of physical and sexual abuse.  Five organizations
have combined to form the Coalition to Combat Violence Against Migrant Workers,
to demand protections for migrants and government investigations of abuse
against migrant workers.  The coalition has also called for employment agencies
to be blacklisted if they send maids to employers known to be abusive.<p>
<p>
Residents of Hong Kong depend upon domestic workers for cleaning and child
care.  Domestic workers are vulnerable because, if they leave their employer,
they have only two weeks to find another employer and sign a contract or face
deportation.<p>
<p>
Hong Kong is planning to import another 3,300 workers to work in retail stores
and restaurants.  There are 11,000 workers approved for 28 types of industries;
most have two-year contracts.  However, 10,177 employers have filed
applications requesting permission to import a total of 100,490 workers.  <p>
<p>
Unions have protested plans to increase in the number of foreign workers,
arguing that displaced manufacturing workers would be unable to find service
jobs because of the foreign workers. <p>

The Hong Kong government has proposes that foreign workers and their employers
each contribute into a pension fund, even though few foreign workers are
expected to qualify for benefits.<p>

<a name="RTFToC23">No
Foreign Workers in Singapore Retail</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Singapore Labour Ministry has rejected a request by retailers to allow
foreign workers to fill service jobs.  The ministry said that allowing foreign
workers to be clerks would lead to more non-traditional source (NTS) workers in
the manufacturing and hotel industries.  A similar request by the Singapore
Retailers Association was rejected last year. <p>
<p>
A Labour Ministry spokesperson said that a rise in NTS workers would increase
social problems and suppress the wages of Singaporeans in these sectors.
Retailers claim they face a shortage of around 4,000 workers.  Firms in the
service sector are only allowed to employ foreign workers from Malaysia, but
they are not allowed to exceed 20 percent of the firm's total workforce.
Foreigners from non-traditional sources are only allowed to work in industries
such as construction, marine industries, and as domestic workers. <p>
<p>
Dr. Tilak Abeysinghe of the National University of Singapore said the wage gap
between department managers and blue-collar workers, which is higher in
Singapore than in 10 other major Asian cities, may be caused by the country's
high proportion of foreign workers.  According to a 1991 Union Bank of
Switzerland study, a Singaporean department manager earned nine times more than
a construction worker, eight times more than a female textile workers and five
times more than a bus driver.  <p>
<p>
In Hong Kong, a department manager earned four times more than a construction
worker, four times more than a female construction worker and three times more
than a bus driver.  Hong Kong rated second to Singapore in the wage gap.
Dependence upon foreign workers will continue, according to Abeysinghe, because
Singaporean workers are upgrading their skills, leaving low-skilled tasks to
foreign workers.  Skilled non-professional workers are continuing to emigrate
to Australia and Canada, leaving another gap to be filled by foreign workers.

The Thai police bureau commissioner reports that approximately 500,000 illegal

fishing and agriculture.  Rising Thai rubber production has led to an increase
in illegal Burmese workers in Thailand.  Employment Department Director-General

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was established in 1951--for

Global Migration:  People on the Move is a wall map available from Population
Action International, 1120-19th St NW, Washington DC, 20036, that uses arrows
of various thicknesses to illustrate migration flows between 1980 and 1989.
The map illustrates only legal migration, and this explains why there are only
two flows pictured that involved more than 200,000 migrants annually--Latin
America and southeast Asia to the United States.   <p>
<p>
The text that accompanies the map provides brief summaries of the economic and
non-economic factors that explain why migration occurs, the economic impacts of
migration, and the prospects for future flows.  Charts illustrate widening gap
in per capita incomes between the richest and poorest countries, and the fact
that the industrial countries workforce is expected to stabilize at its current
level of 500 million, while the developing countries' labor force is expected
to grow from 2 billion today to 2.5 billion in 1010.<p>
<p>
The Spring 1994 issue of the Urban Age, Vol 2, No 3, includes 10 short articles
devoted to international migration and cities.  The overview by Stephen Castles
and Mark Miller notes that international migration is a consequence but not a
solution to the North-South gap, and that there are four global trends--the
tendency of all industrial nations to become immigration destinations; larger
numbers of migrants; different streams; and more women flowing across borders.

St, New York, NY 10021. 1-800-275-1447.<p>
<p>
This three-part book explains that the US was a country of mass immigration at
the beginning of the 20th century, and is once again receiving 1 million
immigrants annually at the end of the 20th century.  According to the Twentieth
Century Fund's President, "Suro's central message is that the real challenge of
immigration is not control of entry but rather what to do about the immigrants
who succeed in reaching the United States."(pvi).<p>
<p>
In 13 short chapters, Suro notes that immigration is the visible face of social
change, and that the US played an important role in  initiating role today's
mass immigration.  Most of the chapters emphasize the similarities and
differences between the immigration of Latinos today and the immigration of the
English, Irish, and other groups in the past.  Suro focuses on the second
generation, asserting that their prospects for success are the key to whether
today's immigration will be considered by future generations to have been an
investment in growth or decline.<p>
<p>
In order to assure the success of today's immigrants, Suro calls for a new
integration policy--a "contract between the receiving nations and the
newcomers." (p106).  Traditionally, immigrants fulfill a US need, and have a
built-in support system in the form of family and friends.  But illegal aliens,
refugees and asylum-seekers, and the minority status of many newcomers has
challenged traditional integration assumptions.  <p>
<p>
Suro notes that, in some cases, membership in US civic society seems so have
shifted from President Kennedy's "Ask not" to today's "ask what I am entitled
to" and, while he does not necessarily oppose restricting the right of some
newcomers to some public services, he thinks that any such restrictions should
apply only to future immigrants, not to those who already here.  Furthermore,
Suro argues that such restrictions are doomed to fail, since "no nation can
conduct large-scale immigration successfully based on degrees of
exclusions."(p112). <p>
<p>
Suro ends by arguing that border and interior immigration controls are bound to
fail, and that the best hope to deal with unwanted immigration is to make "a
determined assault of jobs that fail to meet the standards of decent
employment."(p113).  However, he does not explain how "indecent" jobs will be
eliminated by the market or enforcement of labor laws if large numbers of
immigrants continue to arrive.  <p>
<p>
The Summer 1994 issue of the National Forum--the Phi Kappa Phi Journal-- Vol
74, No 3, includes 8 short articles devoted to immigration and the changing
face of America.  Doris Meissner, INS Commissioner, repeated her goals--to
improve INS professionalism, to achieve control with compassion, and to have
the INS be the leader in making immigration policy.  Meissner said that the US
is a nation of immigrants and should remain one.<p>
<p>
Susan Martin, Executive Director of the Commission on Immigration Reform,
discusses the need to take historical and future concerns into account when
considering immigration policies for the 21st century, and to balance competing
interests in formulating an immigration policy.  Demetriou Papademtrios repeats
an earlier article that concludes that there is no definitive analysis of the
effects of immigrants on the US economy and labor market.<p>
<p>
Philip Martin discusses the endless debate over US agriculture's need for
foreign workers, noting that the farm labor market continues to serve as one of
the easiest ports of entry for Latinos into the US labor market.  Sidney
Weintraub reviews the arguments over the likely effects of NAFTA on migration
to the US, notes that NAFTA alone will not reduce unwanted Mexican immigration,
but pleads that the US avoid taking drastic steps to curb illegal immigration
that might interfere with NAFTA-inspired closer economic ties.<p>
<p>
Terresa Sullivan argues that women, who are over half of all immigrants, are
wrongly ignored because they are seen as tied to the men who initiate
migration.  If some family unification visas were shifted to employment visas,
she thinks that more educated women may immigrate--30 percent of all female
doctors in the US are foreign -born.  Richard Schauffler notes that old modes
of assimilation and integration may not have been appropriate for their time,
and may not be appropriate for today's immigrants.<p>

Cassen, Robert.  Ed.  1994.  Population and Development:  Old Debates, New
Conclusions.  Washington, DC:  Overseas Development Council.<p>
<p>
This book presents nine perspectives on the question of how population growth
affects development.  Cassen notes that the industrial and developing nations
have changed their perspectives on the relationship between population and
development--in 1974, the industrial countries urged developing nations to
adopt policies to slow population growth, and India and China countered that
limiting population growth was not necessary.  By 1984, developing nations such
as India and China changed their positions to favor efforts to restrict
population growth, but so did the US, which argued against abortion and family
planning programs.  As the world prepares to meet in Cairo in September 1994,
the US is once again backing efforts to give women reproductive rights, but
this time the Vatican and some Islamic countries are arguing that population
programs are not necessary or wrong.<p>
<p>
In a very qualified conclusion, Cassen says that most researchers agree that
rapid population growth in poor countries makes it harder to achieve rapid
development.  He notes that the evidence for the negative effects of rapid
population growth is most apparent at the individual and household levels.
Furthermore, even cash-strapped finance ministers in developing nations can
fairly quickly recoup in lower education and health budgets the costs of family
planning programs.<p>
<p>
Chapter 8 by Teitelbaum and Russell deals with migration and development.  They
note that there were an estimated 100 million international migrants of all
types in the mid-1980s, and that there number is higher today.  If combined
into a single country, this "nation of migrants" would be the world's tenth
largest nation.<p>
<p>
Second, they conclude that it is very hard to generalize about the "complex and
indirect" relationship between fertility, migration, and development--many
emigration nations see exporting labor as a source of jobs and remittances,
while many immigration countries are alarmed by migrant unemployment and the
possibility of an ethnic underclass.  Third, they emphasize that the surest
long-run solution for emigration pressures--sustained economic growth--can have
the seemingly perverse effect of increasing emigration in the short to medium
term.<p>
<p>
This chapter also notes that most international migrants move from one high
fertility developing country to another--i.e., between countries with similar
population structures--but 40 to 45 percent of the migrants move from high
fertility developing to low fertility industrial nations.  But the facts do not
suggest that international migration is smoothing population differentials.
Economic gaps between industrial and developing nations widened in the 1980s,
but emigration pressures were often strongest in some of the fastest growing
nations, such as China and Mexico.  Remittance flows from migrants abroad to
families at home total over $71 billion annually, and over $31 billion from
industrial to developing countries, or equivalent to almost two-thirds of the
official aid provided to accelerate development.<p>

Immigration and the Environment.  Available for $18 from Sierra Club Books, 730
Polk St, San Francisco, CA 94109.  <p>
<p>
This five-chapter book is based on the assumption that population growth
exacerbates problems, and that immigration is a major reason for US population
growth.  Unless population growth is slowed, which would require less
immigration, the authors assert, the US will pose a threat to the world
ecosystem.  <p>
<p>
The usual formula for discussing the effects of population on the environment
is Impact=People x their Consumption x Technology--which means that the total
environmental impact of is the impact of each person times the number of
people.  But this formulation makes the effects of population ambiguous--both
population growth and higher incomes (consumption) can have environmental
impacts.  Most economists argue that the environmental impacts of population
growth are greatest in situations where there are too few markets to generate
prices and incentives to treat common resources as scarce commodities.  For
example, if no one "owns" the fishery or the forest, poor families may have
incentives to have additional children so they can capture a bigger share of
the fish or wood for themselves.<p>
<p>
The book takes a macro view in discussing the current impact of people,
consumption, and technology on five areas: cities, energy, forests,
agriculture, and biodiveristy--and finds that severe problems will in each case
be aggravated by population growth.  Next is a discussion of the determinants
of population growth, and a review of the probable effects of a larger
population on cities, energy, forests, agriculture, and biodiveristy.  <p>
<p>
Bouvier and Grant review alternative demographic futures, and emphasize that
the population growth "juggernaut" will be very hard to slow down.  But they
argue that, if it is slowed, everything from the cities to the forests will
benefit.  The book ends with a call to arms, a plea for readers to get involved

US Department of Labor and INS.  1994.  An Evaluation of the Pilot Program of
Off-Campus Work Authorization for Foreign Students (F-1 Non-immigrants).
August 10. <p>
<p>
The 1990 IMMACT included a three-year program under which employers in college
towns could attest to DOL that they had tried to recruit for a vacant job for
at least 60 days, and that they were offering at least the prevailing wage, and
then, to fill the job, employers could hire foreign students for up to 20 hours
weekly during the school year, and full time in summer.  An estimated 5,000
foreign students participated in the program in FY 1991-92, a small fraction of
the over 400,000 foreign students in the US.<p>
<p>
The pilot program was supposed to be employer driven--employers would seek
foreign students after their unfilled jobs persisted at least 60 days.  But in
practice, foreign students contacted employers, and in some cases offered to
work for lower wages--or make some other concession-- that may violate employer
assertions in the attestation but that would be hard to detect.  And once
foreign students got hired, there was some evidence that their network would
take over supplying workers to these low-wage employers, so that American
workers no longer seek or obtain such jobs.  There was evidence of such network
hiring in software firms in or near some college towns.<p>
<p>
The report noted that F-1 students are required to sign an affidavit asserting
that they have the resources to support themselves while studying in the US.
There are nonetheless other options for foreign students to obtain US
employment, including on-campus employment upon their arrival, off-campus work
authorization in the event of serious economic hardship, and work/study
programs that are part of the student's educational program.<p>

Immigration and the California Election</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>California Governor Pete Wilson declared an "immigration emergency" on
September 21 and argued in a third lawsuit against the federal government that
the "foreign invasion" of California requires federal reimbursement for
educating, incarcerating, and providing emergency health care to undocumented
immigrants who arrived since 1986.  Wilson cited the Tenth Amendment, which
guarantees states protection against invasion.  According to the suit:  "The
massive and unlawful migration of foreign nationals...constitutes an invasion
of the state of California against which the United States is obligated to
protect California..." Florida made a similar argument in its suit demanding
federal reimbursement for the costs of illegal immigrant. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown on September 13 called
for a doubling of the number of Border Patrol agents along the US-Mexican
border, to be accomplished by closing the inland checkpoints and moving agents
toward the border and raising additional funds for 400 additional agents by
imposing a $1 border crossing fee.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On September 17, US Attorney General Reno announced that the 300 agents now
stationed at the interior California highway checkpoints would be transferred
to the border as part of the a new border control plan called Operation
Gatekeeper. California politicians have been calling for an Operation
Hold-the-Line in San Diego, after the El Paso INS achieved 90 percent local
approval for an operation that kept 400 Border Patrol agents on the border
around the clock.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On the San Diego-Tijuana border, the INS built a 14-mile fence, 10-foot
high fence that, with bright lights, has encouraged aliens attempting illegal
entry to try to cross by overwhelming the INS with numerous small groups, so
that some groups can elude the INS.  Under a plan announced by President
Clinton, there will be 1,600 Border Patrol agents on the San Diego border in
1995, double the 814 agents in 1991.  Apprehensions in the San Diego area are
down--from an average 45,000 monthly between 1991 and 1993, to about 36,000
monthly so far in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt><b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>Reno announced that a second part of "Operation Gatekeeper" is to
have the federal government reimburse states for the costs of incarcerating
criminal illegal aliens.  The "Crime Bill" signed by President Clinton on
September 13, 1994 includes $1.8 billion over six years to cover the cost of
imprisoning illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes, including $130
million in FY 95.  California , expected to get 70 percent of these funds, will
receive its first payment on December 31, 1994.  On September 15, 1994,
California Governor Wilson called a press conference to ask US Attorney General
Reno to take custody of 19,000 unauthorized aliens in California prisons or to
reimburse California for the costs--estimated to be $474 million-- of
incarcerating them.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On September 29, Reno joined the criticism of Governor Wilson by asserting
that he, while a US Senator from 1983-1991, "fostered some of the illegal
immigration that we're trying to deal with."  California farmers in the early
1980s wanted a non-contractual temporary worker program through which they
could get foreign farmworkers without having the US Department of Labor certify
that Americans were not available to fill each vacant job.  With the help of
Tony Coehlo and Leon Panetta, farmers won such a free agent program in the
House in 1984, and Wilson successfully got a similar provision included in the
Senate version of what became IRCA in 1985, albeit with a cap of 350,000 such
floating foreign farmworkers.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The compromise included in IRCA in 1986 substituted an easy-to-defraud SAW
legalization program for these free agent foreign worker programs; the US
permitted over 1.1 million illegal aliens to become legal immigrants through
the SAW program.  This fraud and ineffective border and interior enforcement
have produced in the fields about the same levels of illegal immigration as
existed before IRCA--20 to 40 percent of the peak workforces are believed to be
so-called "documented illegals." </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The US Housing and Urban Development Department announced on September 16
that it was going to begin enforcing a federal ban on illegal aliens receiving
housing subsidies that was enacted in 1980.  Some 1.4 million poor American
households live in public housing, and another 1.3 million households receive
assistance to live in private housing, and unknown number of the estimated four
million illegal aliens in the US in October 1994 are among those getting these
housing subsidies.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>One complication in enforcing housing subsides rules is the reality of
mixed families, especially US citizen children with illegal alien parents,
often a result of children being born to such parents here.  Such mixed
families will be eligible for  partial housing assistance. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC2">
US Sets Quota for Cuban Immigrants</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The US and Cuba negotiated an agreement on September 9 in New York which
calls for the US to accept a minimum 20,000 Cubans annually, and on September
13 Cuba began to prevent the exit of those trying to leave Cuba.  By September
15, when it was reported that the exodus of Cubans had been virtually stopped,
some 30,000 Cubans were being held in detention camps at the US base in
Guantanamo Bay, Panama and elsewhere.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This policy change can be seen as the continuation or the end of special
treatment of Cubans in immigration matters.  Since 1965, all Cubans who arrived
in the US were eligible for US immigrant status--Cuba was the one country for
which there were no numerical immigration limitations.  Under the new
agreement, there will be an annual limit on Cuban immigration, but only Cuba
will be guaranteed an annual minimum number of immigration slots. <b>
</b></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Because the US has agreed to accept at least 20,000 Cubans annually, the US
will likely have to bend the usual entry rules for Cubans.  The two major front
doors for immigrants to the US are for family unification and because a US
employer identifies a foreigner with a special skill to fill a vacant job.
There are long queues for Cuban immigrants wanting to enter as relatives, so
the US plans to use a combination of a lottery and an expanded definition of
refugee to ensure that the 20,000 quota is fulfilled. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Cuba wanted a comprehensive solution, including a lifting of the US trade
embargo, but the US succeeded in confining the talks to immigration.  By
refusing to discuss the trade embargo, the only concession that the US  could
offer in exchange for Cuban help to stop the exodus was at least 20,000 minimum
immigration slots annually.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton Administration agreed to the negotiations because its August 19
change of policy failed to stem the exodus.  On August 19, the US announced
that it would no longer admit automatically to the US Cubans who arrived; those
found at sea would be detained outside the US, and would have to qualify for
admission individually.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Cuba believed that the US committed itself to accept 20,000 Cubans annually
in 1984, the maximum number of "quota immigrants" from any country (raised to
27,845 by IMMACT in 1990).  The US asserted that there was no firm commitment
to take a certain number of Cubans in any year; about 11,000 Cubans have
emigrated to the US since 1984, including 2,700 in the past 12 months ending
July 31, 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>All Cubans who wish to migrate to the US will be processed at US facilities
in Cuba.  For most Cubans, the only choices for entry are as the adult brothers
and sisters of US citizens, or as refugees.  The US will first clear the
backlog of 4,000 to 6,000 Cubans on the brothers and sisters list, and then use
both a lottery and a relaxed definition of refugee to satisfy its commitment to
take 20,000 Cubans annually.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some Cubans may be paroled into the US to wait for their names to get to
the top of the immigration queue.  About one-third of all legal immigrants
"admitted" each year have to leave the US to present themselves at a US
consulate abroad and show that they are eligible to immigrate.  It is believed
that two-thirds of the immigrants "admitted" from Mexico are in the US when
they are called for interviews. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The only way Cubans held in camps such as those at Guantanamo Bay and in
Panama can apply for US immigration status is to return to Cuba and apply
there.  There is speculation about the fate of the 30,000 Cubans now being held
in these camps--will they voluntarily repatriate to Cuba, and apply for exit
permits there, or will they remain as a costly and perhaps troublesome reminder
of past US immigration policies?</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC3">No
Haitian Invasion</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On September 15, President Clinton announced that the US would lead an
invasion of Haiti if necessary to restore elected President Aristide to power
according to the terms of UN Security Council Resolution 940.  Throughout the
speech, Clinton stressed the need to restore democracy in Haiti, and the
self-interest of Americans in preventing costly refugee flows, as a reason to
invade.  On September 18, with American planes in the air, Haitian leaders
resigned, and the invasion was called off.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>According to Clinton, 21,000 Haitians were picked up at sea by US ships
since the beginning of the year.  Some 14,000 Haitians are being held in
Guantanamo, at a cost to the US of $200 million to date.  Since the US Army
arrival in Haiti, 221 Haitians have returned to their country. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Another 300,000 Haitians are reportedly in hiding, ready to flee their
country if they can.  This "threat of a mass exodus of refugees and its
constant threat to stability in our regions and control of our borders" was a
major justification for American action.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">INS
Mismanagement</a>
</a><br>
</h2>
<tt>The New York Times, in a series of articles September 11-16, criticized the
Immigration and Naturalization Service as an agency that is mismanaged and
demoralized, unable to perform its functions of welcoming wanted immigrants and
non-immigrants, and deporting and keeping out those that are not wanted.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The September 11 article describes "mismanagement" at the 19,000 employee,
$1.6 billion INS--one third of the INS's budget is collected as fees from
persons requesting INS services.  Telephones are often not answered, and mail
is sometimes not opened, while INS inspectors, and sometime their families,
take Caribbean cruises to check passenger travel documents on board in order to
speed up their return.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The agency's budget has tripled and its work force has grown by 50 percent
since 1986.  Doris Meissner, head of what she terms a "dysfunctional" agency,
has an aggressive strategy to change the agency, but the problems of the
decentralized INS appear daunting.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The INS, for example, does not aggressively collect from all airlines the
$6 each passengers is charged upon arrival in the US, thereby losing about $23
million per year.  Bonds posted by immigrants who do not show up for their
hearings can be forfeited to the INS, but the INS often fails to collect this
forfeited bond money--some $38 million over the past six years. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The September 12 story focused on corruption in the INS, detailing how a
few  INS employees in Arlington, Virginia--one of 32 INS district offices-- had
sold work authorization to 4,000 aliens, and immigrant status to 1,000.  The
INS has for years offered low pay and inadequate support services to employees
who have enormous discretion to provide or withhold documents for which
immigrants are willing to pay huge sums.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The September 13 story used an example of a Mexican national living in
Gilroy, California to show how hard it is to deport criminal aliens.  There are
about 200,000 convicted criminal aliens in the US, and about 20,000 were
deported in 1993.  Federal and state prisons hold about 90,000 foreign-born
inmates, and most are deportable after they serve their sentences.  In many
cases, the INS sends letters to aliens ordering them to show up at an INS
office for deportation, but 90,000 are fugitives, and the INS tracks down
relatively few of them.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On September 14, Operation Hold-the-Line was profiled.  This INS operation
in El Paso, Texas successfully stopped the types of immigration that most local
residents disliked--teenagers committing crimes and peddlers.  However, it was
not clear that INS leadership in Washington supported the El Paso approach of
preventing aliens from entering the US, rather than the usual practice of
catching and returning them, especially when Mexico complained that the INS was
souring relations in the middle of the NAFTA debate. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The September 15 concluding story focused on the "cold, rude, and
insensitive" INS by highlighting stories of the INS not answering its phones,
making mistakes that force immigrants to sometimes wait years for visas and
work authorizations to which they are entitled, and for which they paid fees of
$576 million in 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There seem to be three major reasons why the INS has such a poor reputation
for providing efficient and humane services.  First, the INS has the sometimes
competing missions of keeping out illegal aliens and providing services to
legal aliens, and the law-and- order side of the agency has tended to dominate
its culture.  Second, aliens are generally powerless to complain if they get
poor service, so there is relatively less client pressure for improved
services.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Third, the INS budget has been inadequate, and there has been a tradition
of considerable autonomy in various regions and districts, so that there was no
strong central pressure for e.g. a centralized computer system.  It has been
alleged that some in Congress kept the INS underfunded in order to have
constituents turn to their representatives in despair, and thereby win the
constituent's loyalty for helping them through the immigration
labyrinth.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In a harbinger of the troubles that may befall the national registry
proposed by the Commission on Immigration Reform (MN, August), it was reported
that in 1993, California sent for verification to the SAVE system the
immigration numbers of 3.6 million aliens who had applied for benefits.  Even
though 18 percent were not in the INS computers, nearly all were in the US
legally.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A July 1994 poll by ABC News found that 74 percent of those polled agreed
with the statement that "the US government is allowing too many immigrants to
enter this country."</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC5">Immigration
and Farmworker Unions</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The United Farm Workers (UFW) union held its twelfth constitutional
convention in Fresno, California on September 3-4, 1994.  Perhaps more than any
other US union, the UFW's fortunes mirror illegal immigration.  The UFW burst
onto the national scene with a grape boycott in the late 1960s, after the
Bracero Program was terminated and before illegal immigration surged--212,000
illegal aliens were apprehended in 1969.  By 1970, the UFW had contracts with
most of the major producers of table grapes, and in 1975, California enacted a
farm labor relations law that granted organizing and bargaining rights to
California farmworkers.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The UFW won 200 elections on California farms in the fall of 1975, and by
1978 had over 100 contracts.  The number of contracts slid to about 60 in 1982,
and has remained at 25 to 30 since 1983.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There were four types of arguments advanced for why the UFW failed to
become one of the nation's largest unions by organizing most of California's
900,000 farmworkers.  First, it was argued that UFW leadership and strategy
changes led the union to quit organizing and to isolate itself from
farmworkers.  Second, it was alleged that Republican governors have since 1982
failed to properly enforce the farm labor relations law.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Third, it has been noted that the structure of farm employment is
changing--farming companies only lease land, and rely on farm labor contractors
who can "control" their workers or custom harvesters who are employers in their
own right and have thereby insulated themselves from union activities.  Fourth,
there is more illegal immigration than ever before, especially after the SAW
program permitted about one sixth of the adult men in rural Mexico to become
legal US immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Journalists tend to blame the UFW's troubles on UFW leaders, and they see
new hope now that Cesar Chavez's son-in-law has become UFW president.  The UFW
blames Republican governors for making anti-UFW appointments to the state's
Agricultural Labor Relations Board, and is campaigning vigorously for
Democratic candidate Kathleen Brown.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>If personalities or politics explain the rise and fall of the UFW, then
there should be a UFW resurgence that may be accelerated after the November
1994 elections.  But economists have downplayed these reasons for the UFW's
demise; which  means a continuation of the pattern that fewer than 10 percent
of the state's farmworkers will be covered by collective bargaining
agreements--unless farm employment patterns change or illegal immigration is
reduced sharply.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The UFW's most significant victory during the summer of 1994 was with
Dole's Fresh Vegetable Oceanview Produce Company division.  Employing as many
as 25,000 farmworkers during a typical year, it is California's largest
agricultural employer.  Dole employs 800 farmworkers to work in strawberry and
vegetable fields during the spring and summer in Oxnard, north of Los Angeles.
The UFW won the May 12, 1994 election, but Oceanview announced in August that
it would stop growing labor-intensive strawberries, eliminating 450 of these
jobs.  Dole could easily do this because all of its 2,000 acres of farmland in
the area is leased rather than owned.  The UFW has threatened a boycott of Dole
products if the company in fact eliminates strawberry production. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Farmworker wages have been falling since the early 1980s, when the UFW's
statewide influence on farm wages became only local as growers with contracts
went out of business or did not re-negotiate agreements.  The rise of labor
contracting has also hurt farmworkers, since more of them live off the farm,
and must pay for housing and transportation to work.  Workers are receptive to
union organizers, but the changing structure of farm employment and continuing
illegal immigration promise to keep the quest for a unionized farm workforce an
elusive one.</tt><p>

Immigration and Welfare in Canada</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Ontario has 40 percent of Canada's 29 million people, but 50 percent of
Canada's welfare recipients and costs.  Most of the welfare recipients are
Canadians, but there several immigration smuggling-welfare rings have recently
been uncovered, including one that charged $18,000 to $20,000 for each alien
smuggled to Canada, and then collected half of the welfare payments received.
Half of the 28,000 refugees in Ontario are on welfare, including Somali warlord
Adid's second wife.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>It has been alleged that some sponsors of family unification immigrants
take two or three jobs to prove that they can cover the costs of the immigrants
they seek to bring into Canada, but then lose their jobs or renege on their
sponsorship agreements.  There are reportedly 16,000 cases in which Canadian
sponsors of immigrants have reneged on their sponsorship agreements. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt> A Gallup Poll conducted in Canada in August found that 35 percent of
Canadians feel that refugees use more than their share of health and social
services, and that only 46 percent feel that refugees are interested in giving
something back to Canada.  Forty-seven percent feel that accepting Southeast
Asians more than a decade ago has cost taxpayers too much money.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>However, a study of Southeast Asians admitted between 1979 and 1981 by the
Clarke Institute of Psychiatry and the University of Toronto found that only
eight percent of the refugees from Vietnam, China, Laos and Cambodia were
unemployed in 1991, when unemployment in Canada was 10.3 percent.  One in five
former refugees has started a business, often employing Canadians. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC7">Immigrants
and the US Labor Market</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Economists disagree about the effects of immigrants on jobs and wages, and
partisans tend to exaggerate their effects.  Economic theory and history are
clear:  immigrants should reduce wages or increase joblessness among similar
American workers, and increase the wages and profits of skilled and wealthy
Americans.  The disputed issue is how much.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Studies of the effects of a large number of immigrants entering a local
labor market, such as the 125,000 Cubans into Miami's labor market in the early
1980s, typically find little wage depression and labor displacement.  This led
many to conclude that there were no such effects.  But now the evidence seems
to suggest that the wage depression and labor displacement predicted by
economic theory were real, and the problem was one of measuring these effects.
For example, it has been suggested that the mobile and unskilled American labor
force moves out of areas in which there are large numbers of immigrants, or
does not move to such areas.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some argue that the increased number of immigrants in low-wage jobs in the
1980s contributed to the economic recovery after the 1990-91 recession.  The
demand for low-wage workers has grown, in this view, as the economy has shifted
from manufacturing to services.   <b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b></tt><p>
<tt>Robert Reich, Secretary Labor, says that he is as not concerned about
immigrants displacing Americans from jobs as he is about the tendency of
immigrants to lower the quality of US jobs, as employers look to them as the
ultimate flexible workers.  Employers prefer these flexible work situations,
and "at times[such jobs] result in the avoidance of social security taxes,
workers' compensation, unemployment insurance and benefits such as health
insurance and pensions."  For the immigrants, these casual jobs are still a
step up from their native countries.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>At a September 20 hearing of the US Civil Rights Commission on racial and
ethnic tensions in American communities, a Chinese-American labor union leader
testified that the employer sanctions provision of IRCA is known in New York
City's Chinatown as the "slave law," because it pushed low-wage workers into
illegal sweatshops.  The labor union representative said that employer
sanctions left only the most exploitative employers, who bring in thousands of
Chinese aboard "slave ships" such as the Golden Venture, which ran aground
outside of New York City last year.  The New York INS office reported that,
since IRCA was enacted, there had been 605 completed cases that proposed fines
of $12 million against employers and collected $4 million. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On September 9, Reich announced that the Labor Department will be stepping
up its investigations of illegal sweatshops.  Reich said there is evidence that
the problem of sweatshops in the United States is growing more serious.  A DOL
survey of garment manufacturers in California found the more than half of the
firms were paying below the minimum wage of $4.25 per hour and 68 percent were
violating federal overtime requirements.  DOL has the authority, not used since
the 1940s, to prohibit the shipment of clothing that was produced in violation
of minimum wage and overtime laws.  In five cases during the past year, DOL has
prohibited the shipment of  clothing until workers were paid back
wages.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b></tt><p>
<tt>How does immigration affect America's "competitiveness."  DOL Secretary
Reich defined competitiveness as rising living standards for MOST Americans,
linking economic growth with economic equality.  In 1978, a white male college
graduate earned 49 percent more than a white man with only a high school
diploma, yet both were considered middle class.  Today, this gap has widened,
so that the college graduate earned 82 percent more in 1992, and the relatively
lower incomes of high school graduates puts them at risk of falling out of the
middle class.  Indeed, Business Week asserted in a recent cover story that "you
can all but forget about joining the middle class unless you go to college"
(p.78).</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Current immigration patterns accentuate growing earnings inequality, since
immigrants tend to be bunched at the extremes of the education distribution,
and years of education is the best single predictor of earnings.  If
large-scale immigration continues, and most newcomers continue to be either
college graduates OR high school dropouts, immigration is likely to figure in
what many are predicting will be the major economic debate of the 1990s:  what
to do about economic inequality.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The traditional view is that a rising tide lifts all boats, or that general
economic growth helps both rich and poor.  This did not happen in the 1980s.
The richest 25 percent of American families--those with incomes of $64,000 or
more in 1992--get 51 percent of national income, while the poorest 25
percent--with incomes of less than $22,000--got six percent.  Over three in
four children from top-25 percent families get college degrees, versus 1 in 25
of bottom-25 percent families.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some economic studies suggest that too much education and earnings
inequality can slow economic growth because co-workers do not have the skills
needed to make the educated with high earnings as productive as they otherwise
would be.  In the US, the average hourly earnings of the highest paid 10
percent of men in 1992 was almost six times that of the lowest 10
percent--e.g., $30 hourly versus $5, twice the average 3 to 1 ratio in Western
Europe and Japan. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Immigration is only one of several factors responsible for increased
earnings inequality.  A new Economic Policy Institute study attributes the
decline in real wages-- 2.6 percent from 1989 to 1993-- to the expansion of
low-wage service jobs and the increasing globalization of the US economy,
reflected in both rising trade and more immigration.  Other studies point to
technologies that require more skills, the decline of unions, and tax cuts on
the wealthy.  According to EPI calculations, entry level wages declined 8
percent for high-school educated men, and 6 percent for college educated men,
calling into question the notion that more education always leads to higher
earnings. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC8">
Studies Continue to Dispute Immigration's Benefits and Costs</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In response to pleas and suits by governors seeking federal reimbursement
for the costs of illegal immigration, the Urban Institute in Washington, DC
recently completed a White House-commissioned study of the taxes paid and the
cost of benefits provided to illegal immigrants in seven states--Arizona,
California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and Texas.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Urban Institute concluded that illegal immigrants cost the states more
in services than they pay to the states in taxes, but that all immigrants
collectively pay $25 to $30 billion more in taxes to all levels of government
than they cost in services to all levels of government.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Using INS estimates developed by Robert Warren, the Urban Institute
estimated that in October, 1994 there will be about four million illegal aliens
in the US, with 85 percent in seven states (MN, May 1994).  The number of
illegal immigrants is believed to be increasing by 300,000 annually.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In the case of California, Urban Institute calculations for 1992 suggest
that California spent $1.8 billion on prisons, education, and health care for
illegal aliens, while California's Department of Finance estimated that $2.4
billion was spent on illegal aliens in 1993-94.  The Urban Institute estimated
that illegal aliens paid $732 million in taxes in 1992, while California
estimated that they paid $528 to $1.4 billion in taxes.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A similar study released on September 22  by the Center for Immigration
Studies, also in Washington DC,  found that in 1992, immigrants produced a
national deficit of $29 billion.  David Simcox and George High argue that the
Urban Institute used a very conservative figure for the number of undocumented
residents and inflated their tax revenues.  The CIS study estimated that there
are 22 million foreign-born residents in 1992, or seven million more than the
Urban Institute.  This means that costs associated with illegal immigrants
would be substantially higher, which also means that the amount the immigrants
contribute in tax revenues is about $7 billion to high. </tt><p>

SOS in California</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Proposition 187, Save Our State, on the November 8 California ballot would
amend California's constitution to deny benefits such as public
education--there are believed to be 300,000 illegal immigrant children in
California schools-- and social services to illegal aliens, require state and
local government employees to report suspected illegal aliens to the Attorney
General and the INS, and make it a state felony to produce or distribute false
documents.  Those campaigning for and against SOS are emphasizing its symbolic
message to the rest of the US--its passage would, they believe, send a signal
that the federal government should get serious and do something to reduce
illegal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Proponents of SOS argue that the alternative to SOS is doing nothing,
meaning that illegal immigration would continue.  Governor Wilson made this
argument on September 15, when he endorsed SOS, and promised to campaign for
its passage.  According to Wilson, the major benefit of SOS would be to
generate lawsuits that would force the US Supreme Court to re-examine its 1982
decision that states must educate illegal alien children in public
schools.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Opponents make two arguments.  Some acknowledge that though illegal
immigration is a problem, the SOS approach of denying social services to
children and other illegal residents is not the best way to deal with it.
Others argue that illegal immigration has not been proven to be a problem, and
that SOS is a xenophobic reaction to the changing state's demography--shortly
after the year 2000, a majority of California residents will be non-white,
largely because of immigration.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown on September 13
acknowledged that illegal immigration is a fair and legitimate issue facing
California, but she opposes SOS.  Mexican Deputy Foreign Minister Rozenthal on
September 14 in Los Angeles assured SOS opponents that the Mexican government
would "work closely" with them to defeat the initiative.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Two recent polls of California voters show that SOS is supported by about
two-thirds of the voters.  The Field Poll released September 26, 1994 found
that 57 percent of voters supported the measure and 31 percent did not.  A Los
Angeles Times poll released on September 14 found that SOS was leading among
registered voters 62 to 29 percent, and 52 to 42 percent among Hispanics
registered to vote.  One third of those surveyed said that they supported SOS
because "we've got to do something about illegal immigration."  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles Times Poll director John Brennan warned that many voters remain
uninformed about the details of the initiative and that neither side has begun
what are expected to be intensive campaigns.   </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC10">English-only
Rule Upheld by Supreme Court</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The US Supreme Court let stand a lower court ruling that English-only
workplace rules do not discriminate against Spanish-speaking employees.
Employees Garcia and Buitrago sued Spun Steak in San Francisco after the meat
and poultry company imposed an English-only rule on its 30 employees in 1990.
The district court found that English-only rules violate federal anti-bias
rules, but the Court of Appeals reversed the district court, holding that, in
this case, most of the 30 employees were bilingual, so Spun Steak did not
violate their rights when it required them to speak English at work.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Such rules may be illegal if the workforce does not speak English.  One
result of the Garcia v. Spun Steak ruling is that employees have been calling
for employer-subsidized English classes. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some legal scholars argue the English-only workplace rules violate the 1964
Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on national origin.
However, federal appeals court decisions have made proving employment
discrimination based on national origin extremely difficult.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Many cities and states have considered or adopted English-only rules.  In
Allentown, Pennsylvania, the City Council passed an ordinance on September 7
declaring English as the city's official language.  The ordinance made English
the official language of all city business, except when federal or state law
requires otherwise.  Allentown's Latinos feel that the action is a "slap to
their community;" Latinos are about 12 percent of the city's 100,000 residents.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>English was made the official language of Dade County, Florida government
in the early 1980s.  The statute was overturned in 1993, but poll after poll
indicates that white voters in FL do not want more immigrants.  Florida
Governor Lawton Chiles is up for re-election, and observers say that his
declaration of an immigration emergency and his suits to have the costs of
immigration reimbursed have helped him.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Two bills that are now in the US House of Representatives Labor and
Education Committee would make English the official language of the US and
mandate that government business be conducted in English. One of the bills
would require the Immigration and  Naturalization  Service to create standards
of English proficiency that all prospective citizens would have to pass, and
eliminate bilingual education and bilingual ballots.  Proponents of the bills
deny that they are anti-immigrant or targeted at Hispanics; they argue that the
bills encourage immigrants to learn English and promote their integration

Unions and Immigration Policy</a></h2>
<tt>The AFL-CIO Executive Council has called for a re-examination of the
employer sanctions provisions of IRCA and the defeat of the SOS initiative in
California.  The AFL-CIO said in a statement that the impacts of illegal
immigration on states and cities have "been grossly exaggerated," and that
immigrants are being used as a scapegoat for "the general deterioration of
employment opportunities and wages."</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>According to the Executive Council, sanctions have led in some instances to
discrimination against US citizens and legal immigrants, as employers shun
hiring them in order to avoid penalties for hiring illegal workers.  Other
employers prefer to hire unauthorized workers to take advantage of their
illegal status.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The AFL-CIO recommended that the Justice Department step up its enforcement
of IRCA's anti-discrimination provisions, and that DOL stop checking on the
immigrant status (under current policy, DOL inspectors refer suspected
unauthorized workers to INS as they check for minimum wage and overtime
violations).  The AFL-CIO also recommended that border controls be improved,
and that a fraud-proof, non-discriminatory, non-card system [be developed]to
enable employers to verify very quickly every new hire's eligibility."</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC14">Russian
Immigration Controls</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The government of Russia passed two resolutions on September 8 aimed at
developing measures to control immigration into the Russian Federation and
spelling out the powers and duties of the Federal Migration Service.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The resolution said that  immigration control is under the purview of the
Federal Migration Service: it is responsible for regulating migration,
preventing illegal migration, and considering petitions for asylum.  The
Russian Federal Migration Service and other government agencies affected by
migration have been given several months to develop proposals on:  bilateral
and multilateral agreements between Russia, the CIS States, Latvia, Lithuania
and Estonia to prevent uncontrolled migration by foreign citizens; quotas for
those seeking asylum in Russia; and the establishment of Russian Federal
Migration Service offices in the "near and far abroad."  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The staff of the Foreign Ministry and the Federal Migration Service  will
be increased and 12 centers for the temporary housing of immigrations will be
created.  All foreign citizens requesting asylum in Russia will be housed in
temporary housing centers until a decision on their case has been made.  The
deputy director of the Federal Migration Service announced at an early
September press conference that the FMS will soon be setting up immigration
control posts at border checkpoints. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Federal Migration Service estimates that there are 500,000 illegal
immigrants in Russia, primarily from CIS countries as well as Iraq, Iran,
Somalia, Ethiopia, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.  Many of them receive no help
from the Russian government.  Most fear that any protest on their part will
lead to expulsion.  Recognizing the problem, the Russian Federal Migration
Service wants to impose stricter visa requirements for those from the former
Soviet republics and develop a streamlined procedure for granting refugee
status. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Scams are springing up in Russia as immigration consultants promise to help
those eager to go West.  One consultant charged $8,000 per person for a family
to emigrate, and forced them to sign over their apartment to the smuggler as
payment.  The Canadian embassy in Moscow advises those interested in emigrating
to never pay more $1,000 for services.  But Russians traditionally do not trust
the bureaucracy and can be easy targets for unscrupulous immigration
consultants. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>According to the Federal Migration Service , about 104,000 Russians
emigrated in 1990, but only 60,000 to 80,000 per year leave today.  Most
emigrants are well-educated, and include Jews, Armenians, ethnic Greeks and
Germans, who have immigration rights to Israel, Greece, and Germany.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC15">Immigration
and Germany's Elections</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On October 16, German voters will choose a new Parliament.  The Christian
Democratic Union and its sister Bavarian party, the Christian Social Union,
have an election platform that acknowledges the enriching role that foreigners
provide, but states that "Germany  is not an  immigration country" and will not
grant automatic citizenship to children of foreign parents born on its
territory, or dual citizenship to foreigners.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>SDP candidate Ruldof Scharping had carried a gloom and doom message to
Washington DC in April, warning that unemployment and the large number of
foreigners in the country could lead to a xenophobic backlash in an economic
downturn.  But Gross Domestic Product in Germany grew an unexpected 2.3
percent; boosting Kohl 18 percentage points to lead Scharping in the polls by 8
percent this summer. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The SPD asserts that Germany is in fact an immigration country and supports
an immigration law to manage migration.  The SPD platform asserts that
foreigners should have the right to vote in local elections.  The SPD also
supports allowing the children of foreigners born in Germany to automatically
receive German citizenship.  In addition, the SDP would ease naturalization
procedures and permit dual citizenship.    </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The FDP favors controlled immigration based on an immigration law that
would establish annual quotas.  Like the SPD, the FDP wants to promote the
integration of immigrants, reform the law granting German nationality, and
introduce dual citizenship. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Green Party views Germany as an immigration country and supports a
"multicultural society."  In order to become integrated, immigrants need legal
and political equality; this would include easier naturalization procedures and
the option for dual citizenship.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are also several small right wing parties on the ballot, the
strongest of which is the Republicans.  The Republicans do not want any
immigration, believing that the "German identity" is threatened by immigrants
and foreigners.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC16">Czech
Republic Releases Report on Permanent Residents</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A new report released by the Czech government on September 12 says that
there were 77,688 foreigners with long-term or permanent residence in the
republic last year. About 18,000 more received permanent or long-term residency
the first part of 1994.  There were only 5,000 requests for refugee status
since 1990.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In the first six months of 1994, 620 refugee requests were made, primarily
from citizens of Bulgaria and countries of the former Soviet Union.  Only 63
were granted refugee status.  The Interior Ministry has 14 humanitarian centers
which accommodated 1,417 people at the end of June, 1994.   Half of those with
temporary asylum in the Republic are children under 16 or people over 55.  A
total of 14,350 illegal immigrants were discovered or arrested in the first
half of the year.  Nearly 90 percent of the illegal immigrants come from the
former Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Romania.  Entrance into the Czech Republic at
the 109 border crossings was denied to 35,738 foreigners. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Czech Interior Minister says that it is vital that a Czech-German
readmission agreement be drawn up or the republic "could turn into a rubbish
pool for the countries participating in the Schengen Agreement."  The agreement
is expected to be signed after the October 16th German parliamentary elections.
The Czech Republic expects about 60 million marks ($93 million US) over three
years beginning in 1995, to help mitigate the effects of immigration, improve
the border police's technical equipment, and set up a central data system for
the foreigners' police and asylum department. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Interior Minister says that the accord draws attention to the need for
a Pan-European system of returning illegal immigrants to their country of
origin.  He adds that historically, Germany has acted as Europe's buffer
because of its location, but with the signing of the Schengen Agreement, the
buffer moves to the East, toward the Czech Republic and Poland.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Czech government does not expect the number illegal immigrants returned
from Germany to be significant.  In the first half of 1994, 1,500 were
returned.  The first half of 1993 saw 19,000 returned, and 11,000 were returned
in the second half of the year.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The agreement between Germany and the Czech Republic will change the
readmission time from the former seven days to six months.  That means that
illegal immigrants found further in the interior of Germany can be returned.
The Czech Republic would like to sign an agreement with Hungary and Slovakia so
that it can return immigrants to those countries.  Germany signed such an
agreement in September with Bulgaria.  </tt><p>

Recruits 17,000 Indonesian Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Development Minister of Malaysia has requested that Indonesia provide
17,000 agricultural workers for the oil palm plantations.  The Development
Minister said that the Malaysian government would only accept workers with
legal documents and would stop illegal workers from entering the country.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The senior director of United Plantations, Datuk Seri B. Bek-Nielsen, said
that in the future, oil palm production will shift from Malaysia to Indonesia,
South and Central America, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea and West Africa,
primarily because of labor shortages in Malaysia.  The children of plantation
workers no longer remain on the estates; today, they seek manufacturing jobs.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The oil palm plantations currently employ several hundred thousand foreign
workers, primarily from Indonesia and Bangladesh.  These workers, says the
senior director for United Plantations, are not as disciplined or committed to
the plantation as the Indian workers who remained with an estate for
generations.  Extraction rates in Malaysia are about two percent lower due to
worker inefficiency, particularly a lack of harvesting discipline and failure
to collect loose fruits.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>World oil palm production is expected to increase from 14 million tons in
1994 to 20 million tons in 2000 and 36 million tons in 2020.  Malaysia's palm

and Foreign Workers Effect Australian Wages</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A report on the effect of lower tariffs by the Australian Reserve Bank
found that Australian and American workers who remain in import-competing
industries have been forced to accept lower wages in order to be competitive
with foreign workers. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Economists Jerome Fahrer and Andrew Pease found that only one industry
satisfied the expectations of theory, that low tariffs, and thus low prices,
would lead to the decline of import-competing industries and lower real wages
for unskilled workers.  Clothing and footwear manufacturers, as expected, cut
employment by one-third.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Others industries reduced their employment, but not in response to a fall
in the price of imports--manufacturing employment fell fastest in industries in
which foreign competition is not important.  Increased productivity has been
the main cause of job losses in Australian manufacturing in the past decade.
Instead of falling wages, Australian manufacturers responded to lower tariffs
by raising productivity. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Another study by the Center for Population and Urban Research at
Melbourne's Monash University,  found that Australia's immigration policies are

<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This monograph notes that the immigration of one million persons annually
is making immigration a major issue at the end of the 20th century, as it was
at the beginning.  Incoming foreigners differ from native-born Americans in
several ways, notably in that they are much more likely not to have finished
high school, or, alternatively, to have had a graduate school education than
are Americans.  They are also ethnically different from the native
population--over 80 percent of all immigrants today are from Latin America and
Asia. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are four major categories of newcomers to the US--legal immigrants,
legal nonimmigrants, refugees and asylees, and unauthorized migrants.  Four
waves of immigration over the course of US history are described, highlighting
the similarities and differences between the current fourth and earlier waves.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The monograph explains how recently created legal categories--entrants,
family fairness, and temporary protected status, for example--contribute to one
of the paradoxes of immigration--most "immigrants" are already in the US when
the US government recognizes them as immigrants.  Fourth-wave immigrants are
concentrated in a few states and cities--Los Angeles has replaced New York as
the chief port of entry through which most of today's immigrants begin their
life in America.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Most immigrants come to the US because it offers better economic
opportunities than at home.  The individuals who come to the US generally
become better off than those still at home.  Their effects on the US economy
and labor market are not, however, unambiguously positive.  Case studies show
that unskilled immigrants, especially if they are unauthorized, may displace
similar Americans and depress their wages.  Mexican immigrants, for example,
now do the work that black janitors used to do in Los Angeles.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Econometric studies that tried to measure the effects of immigrants in
cities such as Los Angeles, however, could find few of the wage depression and
job displacement effects that were apparent in case studies.  Initially, it was
believed that the failure to measure these effects meant that they did not
exist; more recent analyses emphasize that mobile Americans move away from
immigrant cities or do not move to them.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The one point of agreement among economists is that even 10 to 12 million
immigrant workers have only small economic effects in the 130 million strong
labor force.  The US will not get rich and it will not get poor because of
immigration--or the lack of it.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some of the most contentious questions provoked by immigration are
non-economic:  are immigrants learning English fast enough?  Is their low rate
of naturalization appropriate?  Do naturalized citizens vote?</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>As in earlier eras, there are those who worry that newcomers are not
integrating quickly enough into American civic culture, while others point to
America's historical experience.  Typically, by the third generation, the civic
participation of immigrant descendants is similar to other Americans.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The United States is not alone in worrying about the uncertain destination
to which today's immigration is taking us.  Germany, a country with a
population one-third as big as the US, has also taken one million immigrants
annually over the past few years, making immigration a major political issue.
Only 1 in 100 people in Japan are foreigners, but that country too is engaged
in a serious debate over how do deal with an aging and slow growing labor force
at home, and workers eager to migrate from nearby nations.  </tt><p>

overview of the issues raised by people crossing borders for jobs, and Part 2
highlights the migration experience of 20 countries.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The book reflects an admirable survey of the literature, and is especially
valuable for pulling together conclusions on everything from the effects of
indentured servants to the costs and benefits of illegal immigrants.  However,
this breadth can also be a weakness, since an overview may miss important
subpoints.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The book opens with definitions of five major types of border crossers:
settlers, contract workers, professionals, illegal immigrants, and refugees and
asylum seekers.  However, Stauker emphasizes that "migrants are human beings to
whom labels need not stick for very long." (p. 3).  Most people move to better
their economic prospects, and they follow their networks to particular
destinations rather than simply moving to the richest destination, so more
Bangladeshis move to Malaysia for employment than to Japan, even though Japan's
per capita GDP was 10 times Malaysia's in 1992.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker provides brief reviews of the history of labor migration.  The
Portuguese began to enslave Africans in 1442, but it was only after 1550, when
African slaves were first taken to the Caribbean, that the "peculiar
institution" was established firmly in the new world, to be followed by some 15
million African slaves (most scholars estimate that 10 to 11 million slaves
crossed the Atlantic, excluding perhaps one million who died en route).
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Alongside both slaves and indentured workers were European emigrants
dislodged by the agricultural revolution in Europe, but not yet absorbed in the
factories of the industrial revolution.  Stalker repeats the hypothesis that
emigration peaked about 30 years after the onset of the industrial revolution
in each of the European countries, and the industrial revolution in turn is
dated from when a country had 1,000 km of railroad track.  Almost 48 million
Europeans left between 1846 and 1924, equivalent to about 12 percent of
Europe's 1900 population.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker reviews briefly theories of why people move, concluding that the
push-pull-network framework is most useful when applied to individuals and
households.  He emphasizes that the income gap between rich and poor countries
widened over the past three decades, and that there will be striking
discrepancies in labor force growth between neighboring regions that differ in
wealth.  The EU/EFTA labor force, for example, is projected to rise by one
percent in the 1990s, while the labor force of the southern and eastern
Mediterranean is projected to increase by 27 percent (p. 27).  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Disruptions on the path to successful development can produce migration
humps, or temporarily more emigration and, according to Stalker, export
processing zones are especially prone to stimulate emigration.  However,
Stalker agrees with the assertion that "virtually all the international labor
flows in this century have been deliberately initiated by the industrialized
countries" (p. 29).  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>However, after labor recruitment sets migration in motion, it can take on a
life of its own.  In the Middle East and Asia, recruitment agents handle most
of the workers going abroad, extracting from them fees that can be as much as
one-third of their first year's pay.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker then turns to the costs and benefits of labor migration.  He notes
that immigration, even on a large scale, cannot make aging populations young
again, since immigrants tend to be only a bit younger than the median resident.
In other words, immigrants are unlikely to ever again have the demographic
impacts on their host areas that they did in 19th century North and South
America.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are three major economic impacts of temporary and permanent migrant
workers:  their effects on jobs and wages, their effects on economic growth and
productivity, and their effects on the distribution of income and wealth.
Stalker deals only with the jobs and wages issue, concluding on p. 53-4 that
there is little or no displacement, at least in the long run, and that there is
little evidence that the wages of citizen workers are depressed.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>According to Stalker, "there seems in principle to be no reason
why...immigrants might take jobs from native workers (p. 51)...nor will
bringing in immigrants at the bottom of the ladder necessarily reduce the ages
of natives."  (p. 53).  These are curious conclusions, since economic theory
predicts that additional workers must depress wages or displace workers, at
least in the short run.  The important question is how much, and in the
evidence reviewed by Stalker, the answer seems to be that there is not much
wage depression or job displacement. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker's review of the evidence fairly reflects the literature of the
1980s, when there was high immigration and job growth.  The 1990s literature,
by contrast, has a different tone.  Studies of the effects of even large number
of immigrants entering local labor markets, such as the 125,000 Cubans adding
seven percent to Miami's labor force in the early 1980s, typically find little
wage depression and labor displacement.  This led many, including Stalker, to
conclude that there were no such effects.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>But now the evidence seems to suggest that the wage depression and labor
displacement predicted by economic theory were real, and the problem was one of
measuring these effects.  For example, it has been suggested that the mobile
and unskilled American labor force moves out of areas in which there are large
numbers of immigrants, or does not move to such areas.  In other words, the
final chapter on the effects of immigrants on the labor market has not yet been
written.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker does not deal with the effects of immigration on productivity or
inequality, although most of the recent articles on growing inequality in the
US list large-scale immigration as one of the three or four factors promoting
inequality.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker deals briefly with what may be the major issue raised by the
economic impacts of immigrants--should immigration be treated as a way for
individuals to better themselves, or is it seen as a threat to disadvantaged
natives and to the ideal of equality.  Stalker gives greater weight to
immigrant opportunity when he discusses the foreign maids whose presence
permits better educated women to hold jobs outside the home in industrial
countries (p. 52).  Others might give more weight to equality and the avoidance
of the appearance of a class of helots.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker deals briefly with the issue of whether immigrants pay more in
taxes than they cost in public services.  Most of the discussion centers on the
US debate, and Stalker concludes that there is as yet "no clear picture...on
the welfare effect of immigrants."  What is clear, however, is that regardless
of the disputed overall balance of taxes paid and costs of services received,
in the US fiscal system, immigrant taxes tend to flow to the federal
government, while the cost of the services consumed by these mostly young
people are borne by state and local governments.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker touches at least briefly on most of the issues raised by
immigration, from the two major ways of granting citizenship--jus sanguinis, or
the principle that all persons born whose father, or, in some cases, mother, is
a citizen is also a citizen, a system that reportedly evolved from defining
membership in non-immigrant nomadic societies(p63).  Jus soli, by contrast,
grants citizenship to all persons born in the territory, and is more common in
immigrant societies such as the US, Canada, and Latin America.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Similarly, there are two different approaches to naturalizing immigrants.
Canada and Sweden, for example, encourage immigrants to become citizens to
promote their integration, while Germany and Switzerland tend to see awarding
citizenship as a reward for successful integration.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker discusses various approaches to integrating foreigners, from
assimilation to multiculturalism, and concludes that race is the greatest
barrier to any kind of integration--anti-immigrant parties, he asserts, spring
up when there are "too many" non-white immigrants (p. 75).  Mainstream
politicians then feel compelled to adopt some of the anti-immigrant parties'
rhetoric, or find their rhetoric to be a convenient excuse to hint at
anti-foreigner sentiments in a more moderate way themselves.  Religious
differences can add to native-immigrant tension, as Muslim immigrants
reportedly do in Europe.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The broad scope of this book is illustrated by its discussion of language,
education, and economic mobility.  Stalker emphasizes that immigrants begin a
the bottom of the job ladder, and they and their children remain there in part
because of discrimination against them (p. 99).  However, in some cases,
immigrants become entrepreneurs and discriminate by hiring fellow nationals,
aggravating tensions with native residents.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker reviews arguments for controlling immigration, and finds neither
preserving ethnic composition, nor economic worries, nor the cost of resettling
refugees compelling.  He reviews the effects of emigration on sending
countries, discusses three options for immigration countries:  free up trade,
increase foreign investment, and redirect aid to promote stay at home
development.  Neither is likely to have desired migration-reducing effects
quickly,</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The country studies begin with the traditional settlement countries of the
US, Canada, and Australia, then turn to Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Latin
America, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Gulf states, and Asia.  In every case, there
is a review of the number of immigrants, a discussion of immigration policy,
and an assessment of the current immigration debate.  For example, the
discussion of Malaysia notes that it is simultaneously a labor exporter and
importer, and that indentured worker immigration during British colonial rule
gave the country a population that is about 60 percent Malay, 30 percent
Chinese, and 10 percent Indian.  Some Chinese Malaysians emigrated after the
government in 1971 launched a program to favor Malays, Stalker concludes by
noting that the widespread illegal immigration of mostly Muslims is a
potentially explosive issue in a country in which one requirement for being a
Malay is to be a Muslim.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The book concludes with a global migration table that lists, for 98
countries, whether they send at least two percent and 200,000 of their
nationals abroad, or whenever they receive foreigners, meaning that at least
two percent of their populations and 200,000 residents are non-citizens, or at
least one percent of their labor forces and 100,000 workers are non-citizens.
Under these criteria, 24 countries are both sending and receiving countries,
including most of the former USSR member-states and surprises such as Haiti and
Jamaica.  According to the table, the major country of emigration is Russia,
with 25 million nationals abroad. </tt><p>

<tt>Matloff, Norman.  1994.  "Welfare Use Among Elderly Chinese Immigrants,"
mimeo, August 11.  Available from Matloff at Department of Computer Science,
UC-Davis, Davis, CA 95616.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In 1990, 40 percent of the elderly immigrants sponsored by their US
resident and often US citizen children were receiving Supplemental Security
Income, versus nine percent of the US elderly.  SSI is a cash assistance
program that typically provides about $400 monthly to the aged, blind, and
disabled; some states, including California, supplement SSI, bringing the
average monthly payment to $600.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There has been a very sharp increase in the percentage of elderly
immigrants receiving SSI--the number of such recipients quintupled between 1982
and 1992.  When elderly parents join their US resident children who "sponsor"
them, both the sponsoring child and the immigrating parent must sign an
affidavit of support on INS form I-134 stating that the child will support the
immigrating parents and the parents will avoid applying for welfare.  However,
the courts have ruled that these affidavits are not binding and, after three
years, elderly immigrants without other assets are eligible for SSI.  In the
case of many elderly Asian immigrants, the majority soon apply for SSI.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Based on interviews with elderly immigrants and social workers, Matloff
describes how the children sponsoring their parents plan to get them on SSI as
soon as possible.  Matloff decries what he considers to be an organized
subversion of the US immigration and welfare systems by often professional
Asians who have "made it" in America.  </tt><p>

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>
Report to Readers<p>
<p>
Migration News began in February, 1994 as a six-page, 4,000 word review of
significant immigration developments produced for the 50 UC faculty and
graduate students affiliated with the Center for German and European Studies in
Comparative Immigration and Integration Program (CIIP).  Today, Migration News
has expanded to a four-part, 12,000-word monthly review of immigration and
integration developments in North America, Europe, and Asia .  It is
distributed to 425 subscribers monthly--350 via email--and has over 1,000
readers.  <p>
<p>
According to 200 responses to an October 1994 survey, 82 percent of the
subscribers read over half of each issue of Migration News, and 26 percent read
all of the stories.  Most readers spend 30 to 60 minutes with each issue,
although 1 in 6 readers reports spending more than 60 minutes per issue.  Over
70 percent of subscribers report that other people read their Migration News,
giving each issue an average of almost three readers each.<p>
<p>
Most readers placed highest priority on stories about immigration developments
in their own region, e.g., North Americans were most interested in North
American stories.<p>
<p>
Migration News is based on computers:  newspapers and magazines in four
computer bases are searched monthly, and then students prepare draft stories of
developments that are reported by two or more sources.  The managing editor
edits these drafts.  In addition, Migration News includes occasional original
items, such as conference reports, and reviews of current resource materials.
<p>
<p>
We encourage all readers who can to take Migration News via email; beginning in
1995, we may have to charge for the paper version that is mailed.<p>

SOS Dominates California Campaign</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The "Save Our State'' Initiative--Proposition 187--figured prominently in
California political campaigns in October, and forced many state and national
politicians to take a stand on how to deal with illegal immigration.  Virtually
every major newspaper included an average two stories daily on SOS and illegal
immigration.  There were estimated to be 4 million illegal aliens in the US in
October 1994, including 1.7 million in California.<p>
<p>
If approved by voters on November 8, 1994, SOS would amend the California
constitution to provide that no person "shall receive any public social
services to which he or she may otherwise be entitled until the legal status of
that person has been verified."  This means that all persons seeking public
services such as public education, including higher education, and health care,
except for emergency health care, must prove that they are legal US residents.
Schools and hospitals would have to determine the legal status of clients if
they expect the state to reimburse them for services provided.  If
publicly-funded service providers suspect that a person requesting services is
an illegal alien, they are required to report that person to the Attorney
General of California and to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.<p>
<p>
In addition, SOS makes it a felony to manufacture, distribute, sell or use
false citizenship documents, and requires police to report arrests of illegal
aliens to the INS.  <p>
<p>
Polls suggest that support for the initiative is declining.  A Field Poll
released October 27 indicated that Proposition 187 was supported by 53 percent
of the registered voters and opposed by 39 percent, with 8 percent undecided.
Many political analysts believe that Proposition 187 will still pass, but not
by the landslide margin predicted a few months ago.  <p>
<p>
SOS had a 37 point lead in July, and a 26 point lead in September, so the 14
percent lead represents a much closer vote than anticipated by SOS backers.
SOS supporters have done relatively little campaigning: "debates" on SOS often
featured only opponents of the measure.  SOS supporters noted that they do not
always participate in forums because they do not want their spokespeople in
"combative situations."  Newspaper reporters say that the pro-Prop. 187
organization has been wary of contacts with the media.  SOS supporters raised
less than $500,000, versus $1.4 million by SOS opponents.<p>
<p>
 Politicians take stands<p>
SOS is seen by both sides as a watershed issue in which California may indicate
the mood of the US.  California played a similar role in 1978, when Proposition
13 signaled unhappiness with high taxes, and helped to set the stage for the
Reagan tax cuts.  In 1990, California voters once again signaled their
discomfort with environmental protections threatening jobs by rejecting
Proposition 65 or Big Green, which would have incorporated environmental
protections into the state's constitution.<p>
<p>
The two major candidates for governor have lined up on opposite sides of SOS:
incumbent Republican Wilson supports it, while challenger Democrat Brown
opposes it.  In fact, Wilson has identified himself so closely with Prop 187
that some political observers speculate that his campaign may falter if support
for Prop. 187 continues to decline, especially after Wilson on October 26
called for an "identity card" that would have to be shown to obtain a job or
public services.  <p>
<p>
On October 21, 1994, President Clinton announced his opposition to SOS, calling
it an "unconstitutional" effort to reduce illegal immigration.  Instead, he
reminded Americans that he has been working hard to strengthen the Border
Patrol, which launched Operation Gatekeeper on October 1 in San Diego (see
below), and that the Administration has taken steps to reimburse states for the
costs they incur to imprison criminal aliens.  Clinton criticized Wilson as a
politician who worked in 1985 to ensure that farm employers had easy access to
Mexican workers, and who is now being hypocritical by arguing that the federal
government is responsible for illegal immigration and California's fiscal
problems.<p>
<p>
Democratic incumbent US Senator Diane Feinstein on October 21 announced her
opposition to SOS, citing reasons similar to Clinton's--denying public
education could "throw 400,000" youngsters into the streets, where they might
be recruited into gangs and crime.  Feinstein said that her alternative--2,100
more Border Patrol agents, financed by a $1 per person border crossing fee--and
a tamper-proof work permit were better solutions to illegal immigration.
Feinstein has also called for new penalties on alien smugglers. <p>
<p>
Republican challenger Michael Huffington on October 20 endorsed SOS, saying
that its passage would "send a signal" to Washington that Californians were
"fed up" with the federal government's failure to control illegal immigration.
He also advocated a constitutional amendment that would end the US practice of
making the children of illegal alien parents born in the US automatically US
citizens.  <p>
<p>
On October 27, Huffington confirmed he employed for five years a nanny who was
an illegal alien, and that he had not paid all of the required Social Security
taxes on the nanny's wages.  Feinstein immediately attacked Huffington's
"hypocrisy" on the illegal immigration issue, and several commentators
predicted that Huffington's illegal alien nanny doomed his campaign.<p>
<p>
[On October 6, 1994, Congress amended US tax laws to require that Social
Security taxes be paid only on wages of household help that exceed $1000
annually, up from the previous $50 per quarter.  This change was set in motion
by the revelation in January 1993 that President Clinton's nominee for Attorney
General, Zoey Baird, had failed to pay Social Security taxes for the illegal
alien maid she employed.  Households that employ maids will pay the tax once
each year, when they file their own tax returns.]<p>
<p>
Immigration is usually a bipartisan issue--the Immigration Reform and Control
Act of 1986, for example, was carried largely by a Republican Senator and a
Democratic Representative.  SOS is opposed by most Democrats, but it has split
Republicans.  Among the putative Republican contenders for President in 1996,
Wilson and Patrick Buchanan have campaigned for the measure, while William
Bennett and Jack Kemp, both with more libertarian philosophies, oppose SOS for
fostering an "anti-immigrant climate."  Immigrants, they argue, are likely to
be Republican voters, since they have the "entrepreneurial spirit and self
reliance, hostility to government intervention, strong family values and deeply
rooted religious faith."  Kemp reportedly acted to prevent the 1996 Republican
platform from having a nativist or anti-immigrant plank.  <p>
<p>
On October 27, the Justice Department publicized a legal opinion that asserted
that SOS was not significantly different from a Texas law denying free public
education to illegal alien children that the US Supreme Court, by a 5 to 4
vote, found to be a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th
amendment to the US constitution in 1982.  This opinion marked the latest salvo
in a running debate between Attorney General Reno and California Governor
Wilson over how to deal with illegal immigration; Reno announced her opposition
to SOS with the statement that "it doesn't make sense to kick kids out of
school." <p>
<p>
Conservative commentator George Will endorsed SOS, attacking the 1982 US
Supreme Court decision.  He noted that two of the dissenters in 1982 remain
justices, but only one supporter, and predicted that if the Supreme Court were
to re-consider the issue, the justices would deny illegal alien children free
public education.  He believes that Proposition 187 is not about what a
national immigration policy should be, but what state policy should be
regarding violators of the national law. <p>
<p>
Commission on Immigration Reform Chairperson Barbara Jordan and several other
commissioners also attacked the SOS initiative, which was co-authored by CIR
commissioner Harold Ezell.  They asserted that the SOS provision to deny free
public education to illegal alien children was mean-spirited and not practical.
SOS supporters countered that Jordan's criticism was aimed at helping
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown, who opposes SOS.  <p>
<p>
Most supporters and opponents of SOS, as well as the CIR, have been careful to
draw a line between illegal immigration and legal immigration.  The two major
authors of SOS, former INS officials Alan Nelson and Harold Ezell, have said
that if the US had effective means to deal with illegal immigration, SOS would
not be necessary.<p>
<p>
 Mexican government reactions<p>
<p>
The Mexican government opposed Proposition 187.  After asserting that it does
not want to interfere in the internal affairs of another country, the Mexican
government goes on to argue that it must protect the interests of the Mexicans
in the US  by working to prevent the passage of SOS.  Mexico's Deputy Foreign
Secretary Andres Rozental argued that Mexicans in California are being used as
a scapegoat for the economic crisis in the state.  Mexican President Carlos
Salinas  called Prop. 187 "unacceptable."  <p>
On October 28, the Mexican government complained to the US Department of State
about the "climate of hostility that prevails in California and the growing
incidence of abuse and harassment against Mexican nationals."  <p>
<p>
The weekend of October 29, thousands of Mexicans participated in "Operation
Dignity" and refused to shop in the US.  Organizers said that the protest cut
in half the number of shoppers who usually shop in the US on weekends.
Protesters burned California Governor Wilson in effigy and held signs that read
"Say no to 187, No to Pig Wilson."  <p>
<p>
 Local Debates<p>
<p>
Prop. 187 was the focus of many local school board and civic meetings,
extensive coverage of its potential effects, and numerous editorials.  Most of
these meetings, stories, and editorials ended with pleas to vote against SOS.
A typical news article noted that, like the work registry proposed by the CIR,
if enacted ALL persons seeking services (SOS) or jobs (CIR) would have to
verify their legal status.  Since SOS provides no funds to California schools
for verification, the schools would have to find the funds to verify the status
of 5.2 elementary and secondary pupils, and two million students in colleges
and universities. <p>
<p>
Many school districts held public meetings to discuss estimates of their lost
revenues if SOS were enacted.  The Los Angeles Unified School District, the
nation's largest, estimated that it would lose $4,200 state dollars for each of
the estimated 100,000 illegal alien children enrolled.  But the big losses in
revenue would come if Los Angeles refused to educate illegal alien children,
AND the federal government in retaliation cut off funds for disadvantaged and
bilingual US citizen and legal immigrant students.  In Los Angeles's case,
almost two-thirds of the estimated $1 billion loss in education funds would
come from the potential loss of federal funds for US citizen and legal
immigrant students. <p>
<p>
SOS supporters assert that verification need not be costly.  Schools today
require that pupils provide proof of age and immunization and a local address
to enroll.  SOS supporters assert that most parents today provide birth
certificates to prove their children's ages, so that schools are already in a
position to verify the legal status of most school children.  In doubtful
cases, the child could receive schooling while a secondary check is completed.
SOS opponents counter that each school would have to be hooked up to the INS
computers so that the legal status of non-US citizens with INS numbers could be
verified immediately; such computer hookups would be very expensive.<p>
<p>
Opponents of SOS asked teachers and other public employees to sign pledges
that, if Proposition 187 is approved by California voters, they would engage in
civil disobedience and continue to provide services to unauthorized aliens.
Signers pledge to "continue to provide services to all who request them" and to
"refuse to verify immigration status as required by Proposition 187."  <p>
<p>
California's Attorney General announced on October 31 that he had developed
forms so that public employees could report suspected illegal aliens to his
office, but that his office would not prosecute those who failed to report.  In
most cases, administrative or intake staff, not teachers or doctors, determine
who receives services.<p>
<p>
Nearly 70,000 people protested against SOS in Los Angeles on October 16. The
march was billed as one of the largest ever mounted for immigration rights.  On
October 27, an estimated 8,000 high school students in Southern California left
school to protest SOS.  The anti-SOS campaign has been split between the
"responsible" Taxpayers Against 187, which acknowledges that illegal
immigration is a problem, but SOS is not the solution, and Californians United
Against Prop 187, a coalition of local organizations that e.g., encouraged the
student walkouts, organized rallies featuring Mexican flags, and heckled
pro-SOS speakers at debates.<p>
<p>
In San Diego County, voters view illegal immigration as the biggest issue in
the state, and a poll conducted October 18-25 by the San Diego Union-Tribune,
shows that 62 percent of the county's voters favor Prop. 187, while only 29
oppose it.<p>
<p>
The debate over SOS was conducted largely on emotional grounds.  SOS supporters
argued that the federal government has demonstrated in the eight years since
IRCA was enacted that it cannot reduce illegal immigration, forcing California
voters to "take a stand."  SOS opponents asserted that, if SOS is approved,
civil liberties would be at risk, as millions of teachers and nurses were
forced to become "immigration cops" required to report suspected illegal
aliens.<p>
<p>
Most commentaries on both sides agreed that the federal government should do
more to reduce illegal immigration, and that states such as California deserve
federal reimbursement for the costs of providing services to the unauthorized
aliens who elude government border and interior controls.  But proponents of
SOS go further and argue that illegal aliens are coming to California to obtain
government services and welfare benefits, so that passage and enforcement of
SOS would lead to an exodus of illegal aliens and less taxpayer costs even if
the federal government continued to fail in its efforts to control the border.
<p>
<p>
SOS opponents, on the other hand, argue that unauthorized aliens who are denied
services will not leave the US, but will remain uneducated and a threat to
public health.  Furthermore, some argue,  unauthorized workers fill vacant jobs
on farms, in factories, and in hotels, so that, if their entry really were
curbed, California may suffer during economic and labor market adjustments. <p>
<p>
 Expert Analyses<p>
 <p>
A few newspapers used the SOS campaign to try to educate their readers about
the economic issues raised by illegal and legal immigration, but the major
conclusion of many such articles is that experts disagree.  Instead of
comparing the effects of immigration to other phenomenon on which there is
general agreement on the sign of the effects, but disagreement on the
magnitude, and thus room for debate over what should be done, many articles
quoted immigration "experts" as saying that there is NO agreement on
anything--e.g., "the best people...threw their hands up in the air" when asked
about the economic effects of immigrants. <p>
<p>
Such assertions are neither helpful nor true.  Just as with minimum wage laws,
or the impacts of unions, there is both theory and empirical evidence that
higher minimum wages reduce the number of jobs, and that aggressive unions
raise wages and reduce employment.  The disagreement is not over the sign of
the effect--more immigrant workers MUST, according to theory, have some adverse
effects on the wages or job opportunities of US workers.  The debate is over
the magnitude of wage depression and displacement--are the effects significant
and,  if they are, are the costs of the additional  immigration controls needed
worthwhile.  <p>
<p>
After over 50 years of minimum wages, there is still no agreement on the exact
number of jobs lost because most US workers must be paid at least $4.25 hourly.
Most Americans seem to agree that the job losses due to minimum wages are a
reasonable price for society to pay to assure "decent" wages at the bottom of
the labor market.  The economic effects of immigration might best be considered
in a similar light.<p>
<p>
Two hallmarks of the SOS campaign stand out.  First, it is clear that
Californians feel strongly about illegal immigration--the issue in most polls
is second only to concern about crime.  Second, the debate did little to help
voters think about the longer-term issues involved in having large numbers of
skilled and unskilled immigrants enter the US at the end of the 20th century.
<p>
<p>
If arrayed by their education or skills, immigrants---both legal and
illegal--exhibit an hourglass or barbell distribution.  Immigrants are more
likely than the native-born to have more than a college degree and less than
eight years of schooling--means that many debates about the average or typical
immigrant are no longer instructive.<p>

<a name="RTFToC3">Commission
on Immigration Reform Issues Report</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The nine-member Commission on Immigration Reform created by IMMACT in 1990
issued its interim report on September 30.  The CIR recommended unanimously
that a registry combining data from the INS and the Social Security
Administration be tested in the five states with the most illegal aliens to
improve the enforcement of employer sanctions.  <p>
<p>
Even though each verification could be done for an estimated half-cent, so that
verifying the 50 to 60 million new hires annually would cost $25 to 30 million,
and the national registry could be established within five years for $250 to
$300 million.  Estimates of the cost of issuing new identity cards to all US
residents, and clearing up problems in the INS database, could cost
considerably more.  The CIR hopes that state tests could yield the best design
for a national registry.<p>
<p>
The CIR recommended seven steps to deal with illegal and legal immigration.
The CIR asserted that legal immigration has been and continues to be beneficial
to the U.S., but that the furor over backdoor illegal immigration threatens to
lead to pressure to reduce front-door legal immigration.  To prevent a backlash
against legal immigration, unauthorized immigration must be curbed through
improved border management, meaning there is a need for more efforts to deter
illegal entry with operations such as  Hold-the-Line in El Paso and Gatekeeper
in San Diego, coupled with expedited legal entries so that those who can enter
legally do so; better enforcement of labor laws; and the pilot registry to
improve employee verification.  <p>
<p>
The CIR recommended that legal immigrants remain eligible for welfare benefits
on the same basis as U.S. citizens, putting itself on record against recent
laws that have paid for e.g., extended unemployment benefits by denying some
newly-arrived immigrants cash assistance benefits for three to five years.
However, the CIR recommended that family members who e.g.  sponsor the entry of
their parents, promising to prevent them from becoming "public charges" in the
U.S., be legally obligated to live up to their sponsorship agreements.  This
would change current practice, since courts have held that sponsorship
agreements are not legally binding.<p>
<p>
The CIR recommended that criminal aliens in U.S. jails be promptly removed,
either to serve their sentences in their countries of origin, or be deported as
soon as they complete their US sentences.  The CIR has suggested that
strategies be developed to deal with immigration emergencies, such as those
with Cuba, and Haiti in 1994.  The CIR  called for better data be assembled,
and that the methodologies underlying state suits for federal reimbursement of
immigrant costs be assessed.  Finally, CIR recommended that the US cooperate
with the migrants' countries of origin to better manage immigration from
them.<p>
<p>
The CIR's report was generally praised by editorialists and commentators.
Journalist David Broder, for example, asserted that Barbara Jordan's civil
rights credentials permit her to speak with a definitive voice on the complex
issues raised by immigration.  Newspaper editorials generally endorsed the
CIR's recommendations with if-we-don't -accept-this,
something-more-drastic-is-likely-to-be-enacted.<p>
<p>
Most of the criticism of the CIR's recommendations came from civil liberty and
ethnic organizations such as the ACLU and La Raza; 42 House members signed a
letter to President Clinton on October 5 opposing the registry on the grounds
that it would decrease labor market discrimination against minorities.  The
ACLU solicited funds to oppose what they called CIR's call for a national ID
card to separate "them and us."  <p>
<p>
The registry proposal was also denounced by a number of religious and ethnic
groups.  Newspapers ran profiles of legal immigrants and citizens who "look and
talk" foreign and who fear that the registry proposal would lead to employers,
perhaps mistakenly, refusing to hire them.<p>
<p>
More serious are the concerns of labor market specialists that the registry
might increase contingent employment.  Many employers currently collude with
the unauthorized workers they hire to go through the motions of employment
verification.  If a worker provides a Social Security number that the computer
cannot verify, and that, because of errors in the data base, workers are given
30 or 60 days to go to the Social Security office and clear up the matter.  If
the worker does not visit the Social Security office, the employer would then
dismiss him/her, but could then rehire the worker under a new SSN and name, and
begin the process anew.<p>
<p>
Both INS Commissioner Doris Meissner and Attorney General Janet Reno said that
they agreed with the CIR that workplace enforcement must be improved, and that
the administration was carefully studying the CIR's recommendations.  But an
Office of Management and Budget official was quoted on September 30 as saying
that the Clinton Administration opposed the registry idea.  Jordan dismissed
reports that the Administration was rejecting the CIR's verification
recommendation;  she predicted that the Administration would embrace the
registry test.  But on October 3, Deputy White House Press Secretary Ginny
Terzano said that the administration would like to improve existing systems and
give them a chance to work more effectively before testing the registry. <p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Jordan was originally scheduled to head a list of witnesses testifying
before the Subcommittees on International Law, Immigration, and Refugees of the
House Judiciary Committee on October 3 on the need for a registry to make more
effective efforts to prevent illegal aliens from obtaining jobs.  Instead, on
October 5, officials from the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services,
and Justice outlined what they were doing to make sanctions enforcement more
effective.  Instead of endorsing the registry proposal, INS Commissioner
Meissner said that the Administration was studying it carefully.<p>
<p>
Bernard Anderson, Assistant Secretary, Employment Standards Administration,
told the subcommittee that "employer sanctions can reach its potential to play
an important role in controlling illegal migration if it is substantially
simplified in operation and enforced firmly. In addition, employers'
verification obligations must be implemented in a fair, non- discriminatory
manner and, just as important, employer sanctions must be complemented with
expanded and better targeted labor law enforcement."<p>
<p>
In his last hearing as chair of the House Immigration Subcommittee, Rep Romano
Mazzoli (D-Ky) reminded INS Commissioner Doris Meissner that she promised to
improve the agency's management in 1981, when she was acting commissioner.  He
complained that INS commissioners have for years promised that the solution to
the agency's management woes were just around the corner.<p>
<p>
During her testimony, Meissner said that "control with compassion" is one of
the goals of the INS.  She said that it is "the hallmark of this
Administration's position on immigration policy."   She added, "to continue a
generous legal immigration policy, the United States must be effective in
gaining control of its borders and deterring illegal immigration and the
attendant costs associated with it." <p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">Operation
Gatekeeper in San Diego</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On October 1, 1994, the US Border Patrol assigned 200 additional agents to
guard the 14 miles of border between the US and Mexico south of San Diego.  The
goal of Operation Gatekeeper is to make it impossible for aliens to avoid
capture.  Between the port of entry at Highway 5 and the ocean, there is a
fence, high intensity lights, and three lines of agents, all designed to
advertise to potential illegal entrants that illegal entry will result in
apprehension.  All those apprehended are fingerprinted electronically, and
between October 1 and 6, about six percent of the 6,000 aliens apprehended were
recidivists caught for the second or third time.  <p>
<p>
There were about 25,000 apprehensions in the San Diego sector in October 1994,
compared with 31,500 in October 1993 and 27,600 in September 1994.  The Border
Patrol achieved its goal of pushing aliens seeking to enter the US illegally to
the east--apprehensions in the Imperial Beach sector closest to the ocean
dropped from 2/3 of the average 1000 apprehensions daily in the first half of
the month to 40 percent of the average 700 daily apprehensions at the end of
the month.  Apprehensions in the more inland Brown Field area, by contrast,
rose from an average 150 daily at the beginning of October to almost 200
daily.<p>
<p>
Alien smugglers have been able to evade some past control efforts--using
cellular phones to know when the Border Patrol checkpoints on Highways 5 and 15
are down, for example, to smuggle aliens through, and using juvenile drivers
and nearly worthless vehicles to cope with smuggling penalties and vehicle
seizure.<p>
  <p>
Some speculated that putting more agents on the border at San Diego would not
be as effective as this saturate-the-border strategy was in El Paso because
many of the aliens entering the US at San Diego had come from the interior of
Mexico and were attempting to migrate to Los Angeles.  In EL Paso, 70 percent
of the illegal entrants were destined for the El Paso area, while over 95
percent of those apprehended south of San Diego are headed for destinations
outside the area, usually to Los Angeles, 120 miles north.  <p>
<p>
This means the reaction to saturating the border with agents is likely to be
different--in El Paso, reducing illegal entries and expediting legal entries
was supported by 90 percent of EL Paso residents.  In San Diego, most aliens
pay smugglers $300 for the trip to Los Angeles, and many have a mindset that
they must attempt illegal entry repeatedly until they succeed.<p>
<p>
Some predicted that there would be violence on the border, as desperate aliens
and their smugglers clashed with the Border Patrol.  This does not seem to be
the case; during the first three weeks of Operation Gatekeeper, there were only
five charges that the Border Patrol abused aliens attempting to illegally enter
the US.  However, legal services groups on October 24, sent a letter to the INS
complaining about the "rough handling" of apprehended aliens, the lack of food
in "overcrowded" detention facilities, and the "practice" of returning men to
Mexico about 90 miles east of San Diego in Mexicali, while women and children
are returned to Tijuana.<p>
<p>
Some Mexican observers, as well as the president of the Border Patrol agents'
union, are skeptical of the effectiveness of Operation Gatekeeper.  Several
Mexican critics complained that saturating the border with agents runs counter
to NAFTA's goal of free trade.  The Border  Patrol union would presumably like
to see even more agents assigned to border security.<p>
<p>
The Border Patrol has budgeted $236 million for safeguarding the US-Mexican
border in FY95, equivalent to $650,000 daily.  The next saturate-the-border
operation is Operation Safeguard in Arizona.<p>
<p>
Near Pueblo, Colorado, a federal prison includes inmates from 129 countries,
and foreign-born persons, most convicted of drug offenses, are 28 percent of
the inmates.  Nationwide, the cost of keeping foreigners in jail is $1 million
daily.  In an effort to reduce these costs, the US is attempting to return
convicted foreign felons to their home countries--about 200 have been returned
to Mexico so far.<p>
<p>
Florida has received permission to try a pilot program for three months in
which illegal aliens who are accused of misdemeanors and non-violent felonies
could avoid trial in the US by agreeing to be deported.  Those deported would
have to agree not to return to the US.<p>
 <p>
Jamie Gorelick, Deputy US Attorney General, reviewed Operation Gatekeeper on
October 13 and reported that it is part of a Clinton Administration plan "to
close the entire border."  <p>

<a name="RTFToC5">Judge
Stops Return of Cubans</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On October 14, President Clinton announced that Cubans being held at Guantanamo
would have to return first to Cuba to apply for U.S. immigrant status or to
participate in a lottery that will select a total of at least 20,000 Cuban
immigrants each year.<p>
<p>
On October 24 attorneys filed a class-action suit on behalf of some of the
Cubans being held in Guantanamo, arguing that the conditions there are so
intolerable that the US government is forcing Cubans to return "voluntarily."
The suit asked a federal judge to order the administration to permit Cubans in
Guantanamo to receive counseling about their rights and to have immigration
hearings there.  On October 25, a US district judge blocked the return to
Havana of 23 Cubans, pending a resolution of the suit.  On October 29, 21 of
these Cubans signed a letter to the judge asking that they be allowed to return
to Havana.<p>
<p>
So far, 42 of the 23,699 Cubans at Guantanamo have returned to Cuba
voluntarily.  Another 8,206 Cubans are housed in Panama. Nearly 20,000 Haitians
were at Guantanamo, and the State Department reported on October 25 that 13,500
of them have voluntarily returned home.  The Clinton Administration said that
the elderly and unaccompanied minors among the 27,000 Cubans housed at the U.S.
base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, would be allowed to enter the U.S.  <p>
<p>
The US and Cuba are continuing talks on their recent migration agreement.  The
US in August prohibited Americans from sending money to relatives in Cuba--$250
to $500 million per year--and Cuba would like the ban lifted. <p>

<a name="RTFToC6">Agricultural
Labor Shortages</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On September 27, 1994, the Los Angeles Times reported that "raisin farmers were
hit by shortage of workers."  The article quoted grower assertions that 50
percent of the estimated 50,000 harvest workers who cut bunches of grapes and
lay them on paper trays to dry into raisins were unauthorized, that farm labor
contractors who organize the crews to harvest grapes were reporting 15 to 20
percent shortages, and that there was a conflict between traditional grower
support for Governor Wilson and his endorsement of the SOS initiative that
would deny benefits to illegal immigrants.  The story ended on a familiar
refrain, quoting a raisin packer asserting that "if you removed every illegal
alien from this state tomorrow, you'd see the business--and not just the
agricultural business--start to crumble."<p>
<p>
Growers fear that the passage of Proposition 187 will lead severe labor
shortages.  They have already met with the INS to discuss what will happen if
the proposition passes.  Some growers are pushing for a guestworker program to
allow temporary farm workers to enter the country legally. <p>
<p>
"Farm labor shortages" were the rallying cry of California and other western
farmers in the debate preceding IRCA in 1986, and California Congressional
representatives from Representatives Coehlo and Panetta to Senator Wilson
energetically pushed their colleagues to accept their constituents arguments
that the "nature of California agriculture" required a unique guestworker
program.  Such activities prompted President Clinton  in October 1994 to note
that 'If the people in California would be fully candid, they would have to
say<p>
that leadership decisions made in the past in California have actually<p>
facilitated illegal immigration."<p>
<p>
Farmers won in IRCA, a unique SAW legalization program and insurance that, if
too many newly-legalized farmworkers left the fields, replenishment immigrants
could be imported.  And farmers monitored the labor market closely.  In 1987,
isolated reports of labor shortages led then-Senator Pete Wilson to write a
letter to President Reagan complaining of "burdensome SAW application
procedures."  In the House, Representative Fazio requested a GAO survey of West
Coast growers to provide "proof" of a farm labor shortage.<p>
<p>
Fazio won a border-entry legalization program under which alien workers without
documents could come to a US port of entry, assert that they had worked as
illegal aliens in 1985-86, and then receive temporary work permits to enter the
US, so that they could work while obtaining documentation of their 1985-86
employment, and then apply for legalization.  Over 100,000 aliens entered the
US in this manner, helping to end complaints of labor shortages.<p>
<p>
There were practically no reports of farm labor shortages between 1988 and
1993.  Indeed, in preparing its final report in 1992, the grower-dominated
Commission on Agricultural Workers concluded that "there is a general
oversupply of farm labor nationwide." (xx), that "employer sanctions have been
ineffective at preventing, and have not significantly curtailed, the employment
of unauthorized workers in agriculture," (xxi), and that, "since IRCA, growers
have generally been able to make planting decisions and assume that workers
would be available...INDIVIDUAL PRODUCERS...may experience spot labor shortages
[that can be remedied with] better systems for recruiting and training workers,
transporting them to their jobs, and providing housing."(xxiii, emphasis
added).<p>
<p>
Raisin harvesting is the single most labor-intensive harvesting activity in
North America, and fears of farm labor shortages have been part of the industry
since is founding in California in the 1880s--there were almost as many acres
of raisin grapes in California in 1920 as there are today. The raisin industry
is part of the larger grape industry--about 48 percent of California's 700,000
acres of vineyards are planted with varieties that are usually used for wine,
40 percent to raisin varieties, and 12 percent for table grape varieties.  But
the major raisin grape variety--Thompson seedless--is versatile--it can be used
for table grapes, wine, or raisins.  The need for raisin harvesters near Fresno
depends on the relative prices of tables grapes, wine grapes, and raisin
grapes, as well as whether the raisin industry is engaged in one of its
periodic don't-pick programs to limit the supply and thus increase the price of
raisins.<p>
<p>
Raisin harvesting is a relatively short-term and low-paying job.  According the
most recent definitive study of raisin harvesters, workers prefer jobs that
last longer than the four- to six-week raisin harvest, such as citrus
harvesting, or jobs that enable them to have higher hourly earnings, such as
Washington apple harvesting.  Although there is a relative lull in worker
activity in early August, growers aiming to maximize the sugar content of their
raisins wait as long as possible to begin harvesting their grapes, which
produces a perennial labor shortage as growers scramble to get the grapes cut
and dried by the sun before the first rain falls.<p>
<p>
In 1994, there was bumper crop of raisins and a bumper crop of Washington
apples. Many workers went north to pick apples, resulting in a "shortage" of
raisin harvesters.  Some officials estimate that the labor pool shrank by 15
percent.  Many growers reluctantly raised the raisin piecerate wage from $0.15
to $0.16 or even $0.17 for each 25 pounds of green grapes that are cut and laid
on a paper tray to dry.  Many growers also raised the commission they pay to
farm labor contractors from $0.05 to $0.06, but $0.16 was the average rate paid
in 1991.  At this rate, 10 percent of the workers earned less than the $4.25
minimum wage in 1991. <p>
<p>
In 1994, rains came with about 25 percent still on the ground.  Growers
predicted that the combination of rains and the labor shortage will lower crop
estimates  between 20,000 to 50,000 tons for a total yield of approximately
404,677 tons. However, even though the rain may have ruined some of the raisins
drying in the sun, the president of the Fresno Cooperative Raisin Growers noted
that "Even if the 25 percent that's out in the field now got totally wiped out
by rain, there's still plenty of raisins to take care of supply and demand for
a whole year."<p>
<p>
There will always be labor shortages in the raisin industry--the only question
is how much growers will complain about them.  Any industry that offers a short
season of work, does little to recruit workers, and discards them when the
harvest is completed, will be forced to use workers who are trying to find
better jobs.  SOS provides a convenient political target for what in 1994
appears to be better job opportunities for workers who might in other years
found raisin harvesting to be their best US job option.  <p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Chinese
Alien Smuggling</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Chinese triads obtain an estimated $3 billion per year smuggling 100,000
Chinese aliens into the US.  They worked in relative anonymity until the
grounding of the Golden Venture off New York City in 1993.  Chinese triads also
smuggle prostitutes and heroin into the US.  <p>
<p>
Chinese smuggling to the US reportedly began in the 1980s, when farmers in
Fujian, on the southeastern coast of China, lost their land to factories, which
hired mostly young women.  Networks soon developed to smuggle people to Taiwan,
Southeast Asia and Latin America--more than 90 percent of the 500,000 mainland
Chinese reportedly smuggled into the US over the past decade have been from
Fuzhou, capital of the Fujian province, and the three adjacent counties.   <p>
<p>
The smuggling routes follow along well-established routes through transit
countries such as Belize, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, Paraguay, Mexico and
Russia.  Many Chinese trade their passport for a Taiwanese passport, and are
then moved to country such as Dominican Republic, for continuing passage to the
United States.  China's Public Security Bureau estimates that there are a half
million Chinese waiting for transit to the West in Moscow, Ho Chi Minh City,
Bangkok, Africa, Brazil, Mexico, Romania and Bulgaria. Their final
destinations, include the US , Australia, Austria, Italy, Germany and the Czech
Republic.  <p>
<p>
According to Willard Myers, director of the Center for the Study of Asian
Organized Crime in Philadelphia, Taiwan-based transportation companies
cooperate closely with the Chinese triads.  Forty Taiwanese ships have been
identified by the INS as transporting illegal aliens. The money earned by the
illegal smuggling is laundered in Taiwan, where there are safe houses.
Immigrants typically pay about $30,000 for a standard air-smuggling package,
which includes $500 for a Chinese passport and $250 for an exit visa.  An
"official government business" passport, which is rarely challenged by the INS,
costs an additional $15,000. <p>
<p>
Government corruption in transit countries is reportedly rife.  In Belize, the
minister for immigration was fired after he accepted bribes from Chinese
smugglers.  In July, the regional chief of the Mexican immigration service in
Tijuana and two of his deputies were dismissed and charged with corruption.  In
May, a Hispanic civil rights leader and three Taiwanese were charged with
providing false documentation to illegal Asian immigrants (see MN, May 1994).
<p>
<p>
Other smuggling rings imitate the Chinese triads.  In September, 1994, the
owner of an Indian restaurant and 11 others in Seattle were arrested for
smuggling 900 people, charging each $10,000 to $14,000 per person, or an
estimated $13 million since 1985.  The smugglers brought Indian and Pakistani
nationals to the United States via Canada and Mexico.  Most were taken to
Panama, moved by land to Mexico, and then walked across the Mexican-US.
border.  Another 100 entered the US from Vancouver via Seattle taxi drivers,
many of whom are also from India and Pakistan.   <p>
<p>
In New York City, the US Department of State is investigating several smuggling
rings smuggling Albanian immigrants into the US with false passports purchased
in Thailand.  Most of the Albanians are arriving in New York from flights that
originate in Vienna and Bucharest.   <p>
<p>
The Clinton administration proposed tougher anti-smuggling laws in June 1993.
Clinton had recommended increasing penalties for alien smuggling, interdicting
boats on the high seas, and expanding investigative efforts.  Congress, though
it finally passed the crime bill, deleted the anti-smuggling proposals,
including the power to quickly return illegal immigrants. <p>

<a name="RTFToC8">Immigrant-Native
Tensions in Wisconsin</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On October 16, 1994, the CBS TV-News magazine 60 Minutes described
refugee-native tensions in Wausau, Wisconsin.  This small city was populated
almost exclusively by the descendants of German and Scandinavian immigrants
when, during the 1980's, several churches sponsored Hmong refugees.  Today,
Wausau's 4,000 refugees are 11 percent of the population, and policies adopted
to integrate them have divided the city.<p>
<p>
About three-fourths of the Hmong are receiving welfare payments, causing some
resentment as property taxes go up to build additional schools for the children
of non-working parents - Hmong are one-fourth of the elementary school class.
To promote integration, the Wausau school board began busing school children to
achieve a rough balance between  Hmong and other children in each school.  In
response, the school board that endorsed busing was recalled, and today mostly
Hmong children are being bussed to achieve ethnic balance.<p>
<p>
Many of the Hmong have become US citizens, and they sometimes take several jobs
in order to sign affidavits that they will be able to support the family
members whose immigration they are sponsoring.  Some Wausau leaders are calling
for a moratorium on immigration into the city.  They stress that current Hmong
residents were welcome, but that the community needs "breathing room" to
integrate the Hmong in their midst.  The show ended on a
no-good-deed-goes-unpunished theme:  the beneficence of Wausau churches set in
motion an immigration process that has divided the city.<p>

<a name="RTFToC10">Immigration's
Role in European Elections</a>
</a></h2>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>The Freedom Party's Joerg Haider, who began an unsuccessful signature
campaign to stop immigration until Austria's housing and employment problems
improve, received 22 percent of the Austrian vote, an increase of six percent
over the previous election.  The<b> </b>Freedom Party has called for a
moratorium on immigration, and it appealed to young blue-collar voters with an
"Austria for Austrians" campaign.  For the first time, the Social Democratic
party (SPD) and the Austrian People's Party (OVP) won less than 80 percent of
the vote.   <p>
<p>
In Belgium, the Flemish Nationalist Party, using the slogan "Our People First,"
won nearly one-third of the vote to take control of the City Council in
Antwerp, a 10 percent gain over six years ago.   Extreme-right parties
typically obtained 20 to 30 percent of the vote in local elections in October
with a simple answer to immigration problems:  seal the borders and deport
resident immigrants.<p>
<p>
In both countries, voter frustration with joblessness, crime, and economic
insecurity were blamed for the drift from mainstream parties toward the
extremes. Mainstream French political parties held the National Front to 10
percent of the vote in European Parliament elections in June.<p>
<p>
But the sharpest drop in support for anti-foreigner political parties was in
Germany.   In Germany, the CDU-CSU-FDP coalition retained control of the
Bundestag and government, with a margin reduced to 12 seats.  The Free
Democrats made dual citizenship for foreigners living in Germany one of their
goals for the new government, a position opposed by its coalition partners.<p>
<p>
The Republican Party in Germany, with 17,000 members--down from 25,000 in
1992--earned only two percent of the vote, not enough for a seat in the
Bundestag.   The decline in the party's popularity seems to stem from the
tightening of asylum laws in 1993 and the subsequent decline in the numbers of
asylum seekers.  In another sign of the decline of the anti-foreigner sentient,
violence against foreigners has declined in 1994, from 1,654 cases in the first
nine months of 1993 to 1,052 in 1994. <p>
<p>
Some foreigners in Germany believe that the Christian Democrats tough stands on
immigration in 1992-93 defused the appeal of the right wing parties.  After
five Turks were killed last year in a Solingen arson fire, Kohl promised to
make naturalization easier, but then backed off for fear of anti-foreigner
violence. <p>
<p>
According to a recent poll by the  Center for Turkey Studies in Essen, Germany,
62 percent of the Turks in Germany want German citizenship, but they do not
want to have to give up their Turkish citizenship, which would mean forfeiting
any claim to property in Turkey.  If they became German citizens, 42 percent of
the foreigners--Turks, Greeks, Italians and former Yugoslavs--would vote for
the Social Democrats (SDP), and 11 percent for the Greens.  Only 11 percent
would vote for Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) which, according to the
report, helped to explain why the CDU does not support dual nationality.
Frankfurt, whose population is almost one-third foreigners, has an "Auslander<p>
Parliament" that meets monthly and can submit requests to the city's parliament
consisting of 51 foreigners, as well as an office of Multicultural Affairs.<p>

<a name="RTFToC11">Identity
Checks in France</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Under instructions from Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, French police in
August, 1994 increased identity checks of foreigners and foreign-looking
nationals.  Under 1993 legislation aimed at combating terrorism, police are
permitted to "control" persons suspected of being foreigners.  In opinion
polls, 57 percent of those surveyed support the identity checks.<p>
<p>
Some observers believe that the police are targeting dark-skinned immigrants
who refuse to assimilate into French society.  France has some of Europe's most
liberal naturalization policies, as well as a tradition of expecting newcomers
to "act French" in public.<p>
<p>
There are about three million Muslims in France, and 500,000 of them are French
citizens.  Frequent identity checks, plus the detention of "hundreds" of
Muslims for immigration irregularities, may threaten what some call the
"fragile truce" between French society and Muslim immigrants.  <p>
<p>
The crackdown is reportedly motivated by fears of Islamic terrorism and several
well-publicized incidents of Islamic non-conformity in French schools.  France
has expelled at least 20 Algerian-born immigrants accused of terrorism, and the
French Education Minister in September 1994 reminded school principals to
prohibit girls from wearing "ostentatious" Islamic head scarves to school.  <p>
<p>
Classes were suspended for two weeks at the beginning of the school year in a
northern Paris suburb by demonstrations in support of four girls who appeared
on the first day of school wearing head scarves, leading to their suspension
from classes--they sit in the library instead of participating in class.
Newspapers report that both Islamic extremists and National Front supporters
stand outside school gates, waiting to proselytize among the youth who are
upset by the debate over head scarves.<p>
<p>
On October 21, a Muslim cleric from Metz who urged girls to defy the ban and
wear head scarves to school was expelled to Morocco under an "absolute
emergency" procedure that bypassed the usual judicial proceedings.  This iman
allegedly opposed the integration of Muslims into French society.<p>

On September 7, five prominent members of a pro-Greek political movement were
arrested, and the Greek government responded by expelling between 30,000 of the
estimated 150,000 Albanians working illegally in Greece. The pro-Greek
Albanians were protesting the Albanian government's closure of elementary

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC13">Americans
on German Immigration Controls</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The frustration over American failures to control illegal immigration, and the
apparent effectiveness of German control efforts, prompted a series of articles
in the American press that explained what Germany does to control illegal
immigration.  Typical stories noted that Germany has separate residence and
work ID systems, that illegal aliens are not eligible for public education or
emergency health care benefits, and that children born to illegal alien parents
in Germany are not entitled to automatic German citizenship.  <p>
<p>
In 1992, some 438,000 foreigners applied for asylum in Germany.  Most arrived
legally, often as tourists, and then filled out forms asserting that, if they
were returned to their countries of citizenship, they would face political
persecution.  Most of these asylum applications were rejected, but it took two
to five years for appeals to be exhausted, and during that period, asylum
applicants were entitled to housing, meals, and in some cases, work permits.<p>
<p>
On July 1, 1993, Germany modified its asylum policies.  With more hearing
officers, asylum applications were heard immediately, and the entire process
was reduced to 30 to 60 days.  Asylum applicants from "safe" countries could
file their claims, but then leave Germany while their cases were decided.
Applicants who traveled through safe countries en route to Germany were
returned to e.g., Poland, and told to file their claims there.<p>
<p>
In September, 1993, 10,867 applicants applied for asylum, bringing the total
for 1993 to 92,731.  The two major countries of origin were the former
Yugoslavia, accounting for 30 percent of the asylum applicants in 1994, and
Turkey, accounting for 14 percent.  Germany's labor force is expected to be
41.5 million in 2000, not much larger than the 40.6 million in 1990, but high
unemployment rates are expected to persist because of rising productivity, more
working women, and continued immigration.<p>
<p>
There were 3.5 million unemployed workers in Germany in September, 1994--the
unemployment rate was eight percent in the former West Germany, and 14 percent
in the former East Germany.<p>

Immigration Minister Signs European Agreements</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
During a European trip in early October, Canadian Immigration Minister Sergio
Marchi signed agreements to help ease immigration problems between the
countries.  Effective November 1, 1994, Hungarians became the first Eastern
Europeans to travel to Canada without visas.  <p>
<p>
Canada accepts refugees now living in Hungary.  Since 1990, about 130,000
refugees have come to Hungary, and 2,500 asylum-seekers and another 5,000 to
6,000 families are supported by the state.  Ten percent of the refugees in the
Bicske camp, 35 km west of Budapest, have been granted refugee status.  About
102 refugees left Bicske for Canada and another 75 are expected to leave by
November. <p>
<p>
Canada signed an agreement to provide $1.3 million to help Russia improve its
immigration procedures and border controls.  Canada will help the Russian
government to draft new citizenship laws, provide technology to improve border
control, and help retrain former Soviet immigration officers.  Russia will
provide Canada with access to Russian information on criminals who try to enter
Canada.  <p>
<p>
Canada has recently experienced several publicized crimes committed by illegal
Russian immigrants.  Tightened security, the Canadians hope, will also halt the
spread of international crime, especially money laundering and drug
trafficking, from entering Canada.  About 12,000 Russians are expected to visit
Canada in 1994, and about 1,500 are expected to immigrate legally.   <p>

<a name="RTFToC16">Taiwan
Allows More Foreign Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Manufacturing firms in Taiwan have been given the green light by the Council of
Labor Affairs to submit applications to import foreign workers.  The Council
has not set a maximum number of foreign workers who will  be allowed to work in
Taiwan.  <p>
<p>
Employers wanting to employ foreign workers must meet several criteria,
including participation in large-scale public works projects requiring a
minimum capital investment of NT $200 million (US$77 million).  Foreign workers
can be used in construction and manufacturing, but they must not exceed 50
percent of the total workforce in construction or 35 percent of the workforce
in manufacturing.  <p>
<p>
Contractors needing workers to build schools and medical facilities can bring
in foreign workers if the project exceeds NT$150 million in value.  Private
projects and government sponsored social welfare facilities can use foreign
workers if the investment exceeds NT$100 million. All construction projects
using foreign workers must last 18 months or more.<p>
<p>
The Economic Planning and Development Committee of Taiwan estimates that there
will be an annual shortage of 236,000 workers between 1994 and 1996.  The
Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics estimates that Taiwan
will need as many as 145,000 additional foreign workers to solve its labor
shortage in 1995.  The manufacturing sector hired 135,000 foreign workers in
1993, an increase of 165 percent over the previous year. <p>
<p>
Taiwan requires employers of foreign workers to pay an employment stability fee
in order to bridge the income gap between Taiwan workers and imported foreign
workers.  As of November 1, the employment stability fee for employers of
foreign workers will be increased by NT$100.  The fees range from
NT$1,400(US$54) for foreign workers in manufacturing to NT$600 (US$23) for
maids. These foreign worker impact fees are adjusted frequently. <p>
<p>
On October 21, the Taiwan Executive Yuan approved a revision in the Employment
Service Law to allow white-collar foreign workers to extend their stays beyond
the previous three-year limit.  Blue-collar foreign workers can extend their
stay from two years to three and one-half years.  Blue-collar foreign workers
will also be required to make deposits with the government to prevent them from
leaving their approved jobs for higher-paying illegal work. <p>
<p>
Over the past two years, the CLA approved requests for 117,408 Thai workers to
work in Taiwan: Thais are about 68 percent of the total foreign labor force in
Taiwan. Thais who want to work in Taiwan must pay job brokerage fees in both
Thailand and Taiwan that range from 70,000 to 100,000 baht (US$2800 to
US$4000).  Many Thai workers leave their construction jobs to work in local
factories at a higher wage, in part to repay their debts to job placement
agencies.  In May, 1994, over 1,000 Thais were reported to have left their
entry jobs and nearly 4,000 had overstayed their permits.  <p>
<p>
The Taiwan government has asked Thailand to crack down on the job placement
agencies, or face the possibility of a ban on Thai workers.  As a result, the
Thai Labour and Social Welfare Ministry began a program to eliminate payments
to Thais placement firms by directly contracting with Taiwan firms.  <p>

The Bangladeshi prime minister asked Malaysia to accept up to 750,000
Bangladeshi workers. Bangladesh receives about $900 million annually in
remittances. <p>
<p>
In January 1994, the Malaysian government announced a freeze on the recruitment
of additional foreign workers until illegal immigration was brought under
control. The freeze was relaxed in May 1994, after the Cabinet decided to allow
employers facing labor shortages to apply directly to the government for
foreign workers. <p>
<p>
Malaysia has received $20 billion in foreign investment in manufacturing during
the past six years, helping to generate an annual 8.6 percent growth rate since
1988.  Wages in many jobs are rising at a 10 percent annual rate, unemployment
is less than three percent, and managers and engineers can earn $30,000
annually.<p>
<p>
The plants originally opened by foreign investors to produce electronic
components today employ high percentages of engineers--one in six of the 2,000
workers at Intel's plant in Penang, for example, is an engineer.  Some
speculate that American high-skilled jobs may be at risk as product design and

Foreign workers are drawn to  South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Singapore by abundant jobs and higher wages.  The major labor exporters are the
Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Thailand.  <p>

Many countries are both labor exporters and importers-- workers from Burma

These vulnerable workers are sometimes abused by employers, some of whom treat
the migrants as indentured servants, controlling not only their working
environment, but also their personal lives. <p>
<p>
In fast-growing Asian countries such as Malaysia and Thailand, the salaries of
engineers and skilled technicians are rising sharply in response to the
creation of three new engineering positions for every two engineering
graduates.  As foreign investors continue to create jobs in these countries,
they increasingly seek to bring with them Indian, Filipino, and Chinese
engineers.  Many business leaders are urging governments to relax their
temporary worker policies until local education systems can catch-up with the

Cambodia continues to insist that a new immigration law effective September 22

In a September 19 letter to the UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the
Cambodian Prime Minister said that "I can give you every assurance that no
decision intending to massively expel or canton (intern) foreigners will be

<p>
The main concern of human rights organizations is the absence of language which
defines Cambodian citizenship, so that any person who is not Khmer could be
expelled.  The UN High Commission for Refugees has been approached about
setting up internment camps within Cambodia, a move which feeds the fears of
the Vietnamese.  UNHCR refused the request, and has criticized Cambodia's
immigration law. <p>
<p>
Independent estimates place the number of Vietnamese living in Cambodia at
150,000 to 500,000; the Cambodian government reports that there are 100,300.
Over half of the Vietnamese arrived in Cambodia after Vietnam's invasion of
Cambodia in 1978. The Khmer Rouge believes that more than four million
Vietnamese secretly occupy Cambodia, and they are plotting to take over the
country. <p>
<p>
Cambodia has a population of nine million, compared with 70 million in Vietnam.
Cambodians traditionally fear a Vietnamese takeover. <p>

enter the country to look for work.  A group of Filipinos posing as the
volleyball team, complete with uniforms, was the first group apprehended trying
to sneak into the country.  Immigration authorities were suspicious because
team members were short and middle-aged.  A call to the Philippines revealed
that there was no Filipino volleyball team competing in the games.  Another 15
Burmese had false visas and claimed to be their country's soccer cheering club.
Finally, a team of "Greek" athletes--none of whom could speak no Greek--were
intercepted and deported to Seoul. <p>
<p>
By the end of the games, nearly 100 people had been caught trying to sneak into
Asia's richest county.  Athletes began to call it "The Great Escape."  Despite
zealous observation by Japanese officials and appeals from coaches, 15 athletes
from Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh were missing, and presumed to
be working illegally, by the end of the games on October 16. <p>

<a name="RTFToC27">Israel
Replaces Palestinians with Guestworkers</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Israeli government on October 23, 1994 increased the number of foreign
workers permitted to enter the country from 35,000 to 54,000.  The foreign
workers replace the estimated 60,000 Arabs from the West Bank and Gaza who have
been prohibited from working in Israel after the bus bombing in Tel Aviv in
mid-October.  <p>
<p>
Most of Israel's non-Arab guestworkers are from Thailand, China, Romania, and
Bulgaria.  There are currently 34,200 workers, mostly from Romania and
Thailand, who were brought into Israel during previous closures.  The
additional 19,000 guestworkers include 15,000 construction workers and 4,000
agricultural workers. <p>
<p>
It is expected that when Israel reopens the border, a smaller number of
Palestinians will be permitted to work in Israel.  After the border closure in
May 1993, the number of Palestinians working in Israel dropped by an estimated
30,000 to 60,000.  In  Gaza, 50 percent of the 900,000 inhabitants are
unemployed, and most live in refugee camps with below poverty-line incomes.
Restricting their access to the Israeli labor market will create problems for
Palestinian leader Yasar Arafat, since Arab "day workers" who cross into Israel
bring back $700,000 each day, according to the World Bank. <p>
<p>
In a related story, there is a growing movement in Israel to restrict the
immigration of elderly Jews likely to become public charges.  Prime Minister
Rabin opposes this anti-immigrant movement, arguing that aliyah or immigration
is the raison d'etre of Israel.  Israel already discourages elderly Russian
Jews from immigrating; persons over 65 are 1 in 6 Russian immigrants.  Today,
10 percent of the Israeli population is 65 or older. <p>
<p>
In 1993, 76, 410 immigrants moved to Israel, but 29 percent did not declare
themselves to be Jews--their mothers were--and at least a few were quoted as
saying that Israel should help everyone regardless of their religion.  Members
of so-called "Lost Tribes" in India and Africa have begun to apply to immigrate
to Israel, prompting more Israelis to argue that the "law of return" must be
ended.<p>

Africa Fights Illegal Immigration</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
One illegal immigrant enters South Africa every 10 minutes, according to the
Home Affairs regional director.  In order to stem the tide of illegal entrants,
South Africa is considering a number of measures, including a US-style "green
card,"  without which a foreigner could not work.  <p>
<p>
In 1993, South Africa expelled 96,000 illegal aliens to 39 countries, primarily
Mozambique, Lesotho and Zimbabwe.  But the control immigration officer for the
Johannesburg region estimates that his department is apprehending less than 10
percent of the illegals. <p>
<p>
According to some observers, a country with an unemployment rate of nearly 50
percent, and a population with high expectations, has much to fear from the
estimated two to eight million foreigners in South Africa.  There are reports
from the northern Transvaal that children as young as 12 are working as farm
workers for 10 pounds (US$6) a month--adults receive about 30 pounds (US$18).
<p>
<p>
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party is leading a campaign to
"clean" the country of illegal immigrants.  It is organizing demonstrations and
threatening direct action if the government does not deal with the issue.
Chief Buthelezi is the minister of home affairs, the agency responsible for
immigration. <p>
<p>
Many of the illegal workers are from Zimbabwe, where two million workers are
unemployed.  Farm workers, hotel cleaners and miners are now being joined by
professionals including teachers, doctors, engineers and nurses who find
salaries much higher in South Africa.  There are an estimated 300,000
Zimbabweans in South Africa, most working legally.  <p>
<p>
South Africa deported nearly 10,000 illegal migrants at the end of September.
Over 13,500 Zimbabweans were expelled from Botswana between February and
August, 1994.  The Zimbabwean government fears that these mass deportations of
illegal Zimbabwean workers from Botswana and South Africa will create serious
economic problems for their country.  The Zimbabwe government is asking South
Africa and Botswana to deport the illegal workers in stages, so that the
country has a better chance to absorb them back into the economy. <p>

Spencer, Sarah(Ed).  1994.  Immigration as an Economic Asset:  The German
Experience.  Staffordshire, UK, Trentham Books.<p>
<p>
This book features five chapters by Germans explaining the evolution and
economic impacts of immigrants in Germany.  According to the British editor,
Britons who participated in the conference at which these papers were presented
were surprised by the dominant roles played by German unions and employers in
establishing German migration policies, and by the general agreement that
immigrant economic impacts were positive in Germany.  Some Britons were
convinced that similar economic reasoning would not be persuasive in Britain,
where politicians are reluctant to change immigration policies.<p>
<p>
Some 4.2 million immigrants entered Germany between 1988 and 1992.  Ursula
Mehrlaender describes the three phases of German immigration--guestworker
recruitment between 1955 and 1973, then the unification of families in Germany,
and after 1985, a dramatic increase in asylum applicants, peaking at 438,000 in
1992.  Ethnic Germans from the ex-USSR and Eastern Europe are not considered to
be immigrants, and are thus excluded from German data on foreigners.<p>
<p>
According to Gieseck and his colleagues, German GNP in 1992 was six percent
higher than in would have been without immigration.  Since foreigners are about
eight percent of the population, this indicates that foreigners have below
average incomes.  Because some foreigners still leave Germany when unemployment
rises, Gieseck calculates that the German unemployment rate would have been 0.2
percent higher without the flexibility provided by immigrants.  Sen emphasizes
that the 1.9 million Turks in Germany have created at least 125,000 jobs in
Turkish-owned firms there.<p>
<p>
According to economic theory, the availability of immigrant workers should
raise profits and depress wages, at least in the short run.  According to Klaus
Zimmermann, in 1992, business profits were 10 percent higher than they would
have been without immigration.  However, Zimmermann estimates that workers
earnings were also raised about five percent by immigration, although he notes
that the presence of young immigrants may make it hard for older German workers
who lose their jobs to find new ones.<p>
<p>
Ralf Ulrich calculates that in 1984, foreigners received more in unemployment
benefits than they paid in unemployment taxes--unemployment benefits in Germany
are financed by worker contributions.  However, immigrants paid more for health
insurance than they cost in benefits.  <p>
<p>
Many German academics and policy makers assert that Germany, whose native
population is shrinking--deaths exceed births--will have to actively accept
immigrants in order to pay its pension obligations.  Even if productivity
rises, and more women join the labor force, there are estimates that Germany
will need to accept at least 300,000 immigrants annually just to keep pension
contributions on active workers manageable.<p>
<p>
Ulrich notes that importing immigrants to provide pension contributions in a
pay-as-you-go system puts a country on an immigration treadmill, because the
immigrants also age, and thus draw pensions themselves.  Even 200,000 young
immigrants annually, most of whom go to work immediately, will provide only a
temporary cushion for the pension system, and they barely make a dent in the
median age of the population.  Furthermore, if less-educated immigrants are
disproportionately affected by technological trends that are raising the
unemployment rates for such workers, their economic and pension contributions
may be less than anticipated.<p>
<p>
Germans disagree on whether immigrants will be needed for economic reasons, and
whether current policies promote immigrant integration.  Zimmermann asserts
that immigrant workers are needed in Germany, and that the how many question
facing all immigration countries should be answered by calculating the marginal
contributions of immigrants, as well as their marginal costs of adaptation, and
halting immigration when costs exceed contributions.  He further echoes the
call for a GATT-analog--a General Agreement on Migration Policy, he asserts,
could allow European countries to establish immigration quotas for economic
migrants, thereby reducing the number of asylum seekers.<p>
<p>
Many Germans and foreign observers have noted the contradiction in current
German immigration policy--promote the integration of foreigners who wish to
stay, but also encourage the return of those who can be persuaded to leave.  In
this context, integration is usually thought of as foreigners accepting and
adopting German customs.  Sen and many Germans argue that foreigners settled in
Germany should be allowed to have dual citizenship, so that they can
participate in German political life, and be taken seriously by politicians,
and not have to appear disloyal to their countries of origin, or give up the
right to inherit property or invest on favorable terms there.  However, the
current Kohl government has expressed opposition to dual citizenship.<p>

<p>
According to the 1990 Census of Population, foreign-born persons were eight
percent of the US population and 10 percent of the households receiving public
assistance payments, but they received 13 percent of all cash assistance
payments from programs such as AFDC and SSI, reflecting larger immigrant
families.  The typical household headed by a native-born person on welfare
received $4,000 in cash benefits in 1989, versus $5,400 by households getting
cash assistance whose heads were foreign-born.  <p>
<p>
The percentage of families receiving cash assistance and headed by a
foreign-born person varied by country of origin:  it was highest for persons
from Southeast Asia, about 11 to 12 percent for immigrants from Mexico, and two
to four percent for persons from East Asia.  For immigrants from most
countries, the percentage of families receiving cash assistance has been
rising--about 30 percent of the households headed by immigrants from the
Dominican Republic are receiving cash assistance even after 10 years in the
US.<p>

Clark, Rebecca et.al. 1994.  Fiscal Impacts of Undocumented Aliens:  Selected
Estimates for Seven States.  Available from the Urban Institute, 2100 M St,
Washington, DC, 20037.  September.<p>
<p>
This study was conducted at the request of the Office of Management and Budget
and Department of Justice to examine the fiscal effects of unauthorized or
illegal aliens in seven states--California, Florida, Texas, New York, Illinois.
Arizona, and New Jersy.  Estimates were developed for three types of costs
incurred to provide services to illegal aliens--incarceration, elementary and
secondary education, and emergency medical services--and the federal, state,
and local taxes paid by these aliens.<p>
<p>
Based on INS estimates (MN, May, 1994), the Urban Institute estimated that
there were 3.4 million illegal aliens in the US in October 1992, and 86 percent
were in the seven-study states.  As of March 1994, the Urban Institute
estimated that 21,395 illegal aliens were incarcerated in the seven states at a
cost of $471 million per year or an average annual cost to the states of
$22,000 each; 641,000 illegal alien pupils enrolled in public schools at a cost
of $3.1 billion or $4,800 each; and $445 million was spent on Medicaid for a
presumed 3.2 million unauthorized aliens in 1993, or $1,400 each--the number of
unauthorized aliens is estimated to increase by 300,000 per year, and 86
percent are in these seven states. <p>
<p>
The taxes paid by unauthorized aliens to state and local governments were
estimated indirectly to be $1.9 billion.  These taxes included 59 percent from
sales taxes, 37 percent from property taxes, and five percent from state income
taxes.<p>
