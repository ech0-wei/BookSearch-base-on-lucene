BIGGER MAY NOT BE BETTER

The general condition of the U.S. chemical industry in 1995 shows
a pattern of slight production growth, substantially increasing
corporate earnings growth and an equally consistent decline in
employment. This pattern shows certain corporate operating
principles that deserve critical judgement. These are as follows.

     1) Profits will be higher if you pay fewer people.
     2) A declining dollar can create a market without investment
     in the human resource for process improvement and change.
     3) It is possible to meet market demand without production and
     process improvement by expanding older system and design
     concepts. The steel industry is a historical precedent.
     4) The investment in human capital can be forfeit now to be
     recovered in the future at a lower price.

The following reference expresses concern for the next year. The
dollar is gaining value and controls are being relaxed. There are
many  talented people in the marketplace. It should not be long
before "mom and pop" operations can distribute rubbing alcohol to
the local pharmacies at half the price. Microbrewries are now a
commonplace on the east coast. At a price they offer quality and
choice not available since before prohibition. Long Island now has
its own wine industry. It will soon recognize that its potato crop
would be useful for production and pipeline delivery of vodka to be
drunk in Manhattan and shipped world wide from the Port of New
York. A right-of-way along the Long Island Railroad will do.

Most of the processes operating in the chemical industry now can
and will be copied and improved by the Chinese. Chemical production
is an ongoing process of growth based on improvement. There are
many aspects to improvement. Purity, safety, reliability, speed,
applications of new materials and computer resources are examples.
The present state of affairs is a one way ticket to obsolescence.

SILICON SENSORS

Few materials can compare to silicon for its usefulness in sensor
design. The first commercial use of the material was in preparation
of photosensors in 1960. In the last 35 years silicon has not
changed but there have been numerous changes in technology and
market demand that increases its usefulness to the measurement and
instrumentation field.

The following reference describes improvements and devices that
serve new demands. There are 10,000 researchers operating in 200
laboratories that continue the study of silicon sensor devices.
Recent improvement in technology makes controlled doping possible.
It is now possible to make multiwavelength sensor that limit
response as a function of the depth of penetration of the
stimulated carriers.

In addition there are demands that appear out of environmental
monitoring needs and biosensing systems. Surface acoustic waves and
microcalorimetric enzyme catalyst measuring systems are two
examples of these applications. The reference contains many more.

Anyone interested in silicon devices should see this paper. It is
18 pages long with about 100 references. Most of them are to recent
papers.

MICROMACHINING TECHNOLOGY MAKES SMARTER USEFUL SENSORS

Developments in micromachining show considerable advancement in the
fabrication of complex sensors. Earlier work was limited to silicon
optical and pressure sensors. Now there are demonstrations of gas
chromatography on a chip. These devices include valving, a flow
channel and a detector.

There are various applications for these devices, but one of the
more important is biological and biomedical sensing. One
application is the monitoring of biological cells individually. An
example is the observation in vitro of the responses of a cardiac
cell under the influence of various chemicals.

On the small scale of these sensors it is necessary to rethink the
physical properties of familiar materials. The surface tension of
water can have a sealing action on a piston cylinder array.
Chemical sensors based on these devices are currently in commercial
development. Taguchi type sensors on micromachined silicon have an
increased level of versatility. The response time can be controlled
by heaters designed into the system with a fast response and
minimum power.

DIODE-BASED DETECTOR SPEEDS DNA ANALYSIS

Allen Northrup of Lawrence Livermore laboratories describes a
compact assembly that performs the polymerase chain reaction. This
reaction is important in cloning DNA to increase its concentration
for more precise and more rapid detection. It is useful in
detecting viruses, bacteria, mutations associated with cystic
fibrosis and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

The unit is much smaller than the hardware presently available for
these measurements and promises to be an order of magnitude
cheaper. It replaces a laser with a diode in the detection
circuitry. It uses semiconductor fabrication techniques to prepare
the thermal cycling process. This technology incorporates heaters
and controllers in the silicon chambers. The small size and thermal
mass permits rapid heating and cooling.

The technology duplicates a process developed by Kary Mullis that
received the Nobel prize in 1993. Hardware available before this
development to process samples for cloning was between $7000 and
$14,000, requiring hours of processing. This hardware does the
operation in minutes.

The following reference is descriptive. It  would be improved with
a drawing.

PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBES TO STUDY COSMIC RAYS AND NEUTRINOS

Photomultiplier tubes were among the first photosensors. Most
replacements now are the simpler, cheaper and lower voltage solid
state devices. Photomultipliers have not disappeared. They are
particularly well suited for high sensitivity at high energy
because they depend on charges transported in a vacuum. Their
application seems to be increasing. They are particularly useful
for the detection of charged particles in space and on the ground.
Cosmic ray detection is an example.

Cosmic rays exist in showers that bombard the outer atmosphere.
Some of them reach the surface. There is an active interest in
modelling these showers at various places on earth. These charged
species have significant influence on the chemistry of the
atmosphere. An example is the loss of ozone at the poles.
Photomultiplier tubes serve this need.

There also is an interest in using photomultiplier tubes for the
determination of muons and neutrinos under water. This revived
interest by astronomers and physicists is driven by new
applications of an old detector. New designs include devices that
are about the size of a TO-5 can. They still require high voltage.

ACCESSING SENSORS USING INTERNET

A project at the Winooski One hydroelectric dam is operated by the
University of Vermont. It uses the Internet as a sensor interface
to measure multiple parameters such as flow and pressure. The
computers on line can bring generators on line when the water
levels are high enough to drive them effectively. The system
contains 85 fiber optic sensors embedded in the structure.
Maintenance personnel monitor these sensors remotely to provide
service as required.

This is a considerable economy over a system that requires
individuals to be on site to record measurements as needed. The
system is useful for control functions and also information
gathering. Apart from the analog-digital boards that are part of
any instrument measuring system, the computer hardware is in every
way the same as other computer systems. It uses software that is
available for the Apple or the PC system.

There are the usual traffic delays that are part of the operation
of Internet during periods of high usage. These are difficulties
that are not as likely to occur if one limits operations to low
usage intervals, such as between 4 and 6 AM eastern standard time.

The authors advise that it is possible to access the installation
on Internet. The Web address is http://issri.emba.uvm.edu/. This
Internet address contains drawings and data from the installation.
In addition it is possible to download a publication submitted to
the Journal of Smart Materials and Structures that contains more
information.

DETECTING CRYPTOSPORIDIUM

In 1993 cryptosporidium slipped into Milwaukee's water supply
sickening 400,000 people and killing 104. There remains a need for
new methods of detection and control of these pathogens. The
current law requires a turbidity standard for potable water
delivery. That does not distinguish the viable from the non-viable
5 micron size cryptosporidia.

There are manual test systems for filtration and tagging of the
filtrate with fluorescent materials. These have about 30% error.
Algae and other materials bind with the fluorescent dye and tend to
give false positive results. There are other methods discussed.
Most do not have a measurement capability for use in protecting the
public health.

All the proposed methods are laboratory intensive. They do not
appear to be suitable for continuous analysis. The problem is
further complicated because the intrusion may only occur
periodically, when there is heavy rain. This is a condition that
inspires complacency.

IMPROVED METHOD OF FABRICATION OF NICKEL-METAL HYDRIDE BATTERY

The demand for cheap portable power continues to stir development
of economic processes of producing batteries. A current focus is on
nickel-metal hydride systems in which energy is produced by
reacting the hydride on a catalytic surface exposed to oxygen or
air. Among other applications the large economic interest is in
clean energy sources for automobiles.

These systems are of particular interest because they can be
recharged electrically by discharging oxygen and reforming hydride.
They also can be charged by supplying gases. They are inherently
clean sources of energy and light in weight. The following
references are to work being done in Sweden

An element of cost in fabricating a metal hydride system is in the
fabrication of the electrodes. The second reference describes a
continuous process to do this. This process involves the rolling
fabrication of a band with one side of nickel hydroxide and the
other of mischmetal required to form the hydride.

The following papers describe the performance characteristics of
the prototype devices. Summaries include changes that will be
necessary to accommodate this technology to electric vehicle
applications.

Electrochemical Society, Vol. 142, No. 12, pp. 4040-4045, December

MODEL FOR METALLIC ELECTROMIGRATION FAILURE

Why would a circuit board that has operated within specification
for a long time fail after six years? There may be several answers
to this question but one may be metallic electromigration between
adjacent anodic and cathodic conductors on the board. The
phenomenon has been recognized since the 70s. It promises to become
a more important concern as multilayer boards find application.

The electromigration phenomenon depends on voltage, humidity,
contamination, distance between electrodes and temperature. To
collect data rapidly observations are generally made at high
voltages, (typically 100 volts). The process occurs more slowly at
10 volts.

The following reference is part of a larger tutorial effort to
focus interest on failure processes. It provides documented
information on the factors that influence the processes involved in
the dendritic growth resulting from metallic electromigration. In
a given application environment these failure processes should
follow a Weibull distribution.
**Krumbein, S.J., IEEE Transactions on Reliability, Vol. 44, No. 4,
pp. 539-549, December (1995)**
NOTE: On page 602 of IEEE Transactions on Reliability, Vol. 44, No.
4, we are advised that much of the federal funding for the very
useful MIL-STD (Military Standards on reliability) is being
transferred to other sources or abandoned. This will be a change in
access and should be examined by those interested in maintaining
access to this information.

Teikoku Sen-i Posts First Profit in 7 Terms


   Teikoku Sen-i <3302>, a textile maker specializing in linen,
has posted nearly 400 million yen in current profits for the
term to December 1995, marking a substantial gain from last
term's 517 million yen in current losses.  Teikoku saw the
effects from rationalization, and national disaster prevention
consciousness contributed to an increase in demand for related
products.  Sales rose 4% to 16 billion yen, and operating
profits reached nearly 700 million yen aided by decreased sales
and administration costs.

Mitsui Mining Ups Copper Foil Production


   Mitsui Mining & Smelting <5706> will expand printed circuit
board-use copper foil operations by 30%, with an investment of
10 billion yen over three years.  The capital will be applied to
operations at five overseas production points.  The company will
also reinforce sales to the West by offering a special copper
foil developed in cooperation with U.S. makers of copper-covered
resin boards.  Mitsui Mining already holds a 40% slice of the
world pie in copper foil production, with aggregate monthly
output of 3,600 tons.  The heightened operating capacity should
put the company in the forefront of the industry worldwide.

Spread the word - congressional republicans entering this
Election Year Should Find More Support For Environmental
protections, and some House leaders may stress this to
colleagues, industry analyst predict. "A number of
Republicans like [New York Rep. Sherwood] Boehlert already
recognize the depth of support for environmental controls,
and they are trying to encourage the party to temper its
stand so it's not anti-environmental," said Doug MacMillan,
executive director for the Environmental Technology Council.
"What they hear in their districts will make them recognize
the depth of public support for it." Superfund Reform '95
Executive George Baker agreed that should GOP legislators
fail to push through environmental reforms, especially to
Superfund, Republicans could "lose the political public
relations war" and could be deemed anti-environment.
"They've allowed their opponents to forecast them as rolling
back" environmental controls, he said.

   EPA, meanwhile, must stand firm with its environmental
policies as Congress attempts to reduce agency staffing and
budget, MacMillan added. Since 1994, "EPA has reversed
course on number of important environmental policies in an
apparent attempt to placate some of its adversaries," he
said. Along with making public statements supporting strict
environmental standards, the agency must not backpeddle on
its regulations. EPA cannot be "talking a good game, while
quietly surrendering to its opposition," he said.


JOIN THE CLUB - EPA began preparing to shut down the federal
Superfund program Jan. 2. The agency is unable to pay nearly
2,000 of its own employees in the program, and 8,000
contractors who perform remediation work. Superfund was not
affected immediately by the federal shutdown because most of
these employees are paid directly from the fund, rather than
from budget appropriations, said Jim Mathews, deputy
assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Solid Waste and
Emergency Response (HWN, Dec. 18, 1995, p. 399). Though
Congress has not reauthorized the program nor issued its
allotment for the next fiscal year, Superfund has operated
since October off a surplus in last year's fund, Mathews
said. That money will run out Jan. 2, and the agency will
begin shutting down the program. Only emergency personnel
will continue working, reducing the agency's program
employees from more than 3,000 to only 80. Several large
Superfund sites will continue cleanups during the shutdown,
while many will cease operations, he said. Contact: Jim
Mathews, EPA, (202) 260-4610.

SUPERFUND REFORM BILLS COULD PLACE
BURDEN ON STATE CLEANUP PROGRAMS


   Superfund reform bills now stalled in Congress may place
a larger burden on state cleanups, or halt remediation
activities outright, according to several state
environmental officials.

   H.R. 2500, proposed by Rep. Michael Oxley (R-Ohio), and
S. 1285, proposed by Sen. Robert Smith (R-N.H.), could
create an intense burden on state remediation programs, Kris
Hoellen, assistant deputy director for the Washington-based
Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management
Officials told the National Council of State Legislatures at
the council's annual meeting Dec. 14 in Washington. Under
these bills, litigation could increase from sites that
already have selected a remedy if they find a more cost-
effective method. State officials also fear the bills would
cap the number of National Priorities List (NPL) sites,
leaving states to fund many cleanups themselves.

   Oxley's bill would pre-empt states from enacting cleanup
standards more stringent than federal levels, Hoellen said.
Smith's bill, however, would allow states to pay the
difference for tougher standards, but it is unlikely states
would not have the funds to enforce further site remediation
beyond federal standards, she said.

   The House version of Superfund reform would cap the NPL
at 125 sites over the next seven years, while 90 sites would
be allowed over three years on the Senate side. There now
are 1,700 NPL-qualified sites EPA has yet to place on the
list, Hoellen said. Shifting these sites to state authority
could overwhelm state agencies, she added.

   Pre-enforcement litigation would greatly hinder site
cleanups, Hoellen told HWN. Both bills would allow parties
to reopen remedy cases if they show they can save at least
$1 million using another method. In addition, the Senate
version of the bill would shift more program costs to the
states, compared with cost-sharing provisions in Oxley's
bill, she said.

   Many states also do not want to pay for orphan shares,
Hoellen said. Particularly, states do not want large
potentially responsible parties cashed out of liability,
which could leave state agencies "holding the bag," she
said.

   If either bill passes in its present form, all new work
on existing sites will stop, said Ed Putnam, associate
director of remediation planning and design for the New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. New Jersey
could only continue ongoing work, he said. Superfund would
continue to fund immediate contamination removal programs,
but states could not afford to take additional remedial
action, he added.

   "There always has been competition for funds among state
regulatory agencies," Putnam said. "There's simply going to
be more competition" if Congress reforms Superfund.

   Remediators would not be able to remove contaminated soil
from some sites, preferring to close off the area, he said.
Furthermore, states would not clean aquifers, preferring to
monitor plumes and treat contaminated wells, Putnam said.

   Putnam finds no significant difference for states between
the bills. Both make the pursuit of funding competitive
between states. "It's just a question of how competitive,"
he said.

Reauthorization Still Up in the Air

   A more pressing question for states is the future of
Superfund, which lacks a reauthorization bill and its taxing
authority, Putnam said. "Superfund is stalled; there is no
new work occurring," he said. Faced with the possibility of
significant changes in the law possibly months away and a
dwindling funding mechanism, it is difficult for states to
make any long-term plans for Superfund remediation, Putnam
said.

   Spending money and manpower to maintain retroactive
liability costs more than it would to repeal it, said a
commercial consultant who deals in government affairs.

   If the remedy process is not reformed, states could not
afford remediation, the consultant told HWN. There are many
state agencies who are competent enough to handle cleanups
more efficiently than EPA can, he said. "There are a number
of states embarrassed by EPA's performance" in Superfund
cleanups, he added.

   States do not spend nearly as much money on cleanups as
EPA, the consultant said. Particularly, states historically
do not take as long to select a remedy or to complete
cleanups.

   Though EPA is blaming the Republican Congress for
stalling the Superfund program, the consultant criticized
President Clinton, who vetoed the recent Veteran's
Administration/Department of Housing and Urban Development
bill last month that would have extended Superfund taxes. In
addition, EPA has been dragging its feet in assisting with a
compromise Superfund reauthorization bill, he added. "EPA
has been working overtime to stop the bill," he said.

SUPERFUND REFORM BILLS TOP THE LIST
OF KEY CONCERNS FOR UPCOMING YEAR


   Congressional action on Republican Superfund reforms this
year could significantly alter the course of how hazardous
waste is managed, affecting many aspects ranging from
impending rulemaking to technology, according to several
industry analysts.

   Superfund reform, a priority on the Republican agenda, is
expected to be the key issue in the industry in 1996. Many
Democrats have criticized the reform efforts so far, but GOP
members likely will collaborate more this year with their
colleagues across the aisle to approve a reform package,
said George Baker, executive director of Superfund Reform
'95. The debate should move rapidly because 1996 is an
election year, and most work will be completed by August to
gear up for elections in the fall, he said.

   Republicans "need Democrats to be comfortable with [the
reforms], and get broad support from industry, small
businesses and municipalities," Baker said. "These reforms
are needed to effectively clean up a number of sites
faster." Once a reform package is adopted, Superfund
reauthorization should proceed smoothly, he added.

   Congressional delays on Superfund reform last year
frustrated members of the Chemical Manufacturers Association
(CMA). As the debate drags on, the association is concerned
that legislators will tinker with proposed bills further,
allowing more exemptions. "We're getting to the point where
deals will be made here and there," said CMA spokesman Matt
Weinstock. "As long as it floats around, there are more
chances for industry to make carveouts. Congress needs to
get this thing done without creating a new unfair system."

   CMA also urges Congress to pass H.R. 2036. The bill would
streamline land disposal restrictions under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (see story, this page).
"The bill will make management of waste fairer and easier to
comply," Weinstock said, praising the bipartisan effort to
approve the bill. "If we could have had that effort on
Superfund, we'd be done."

   EPA's Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR),
scheduled for promulgation late this year, also may impact
hazardous waste management (HWN, Dec. 4, 1995, p. 384).
However, Title 9 of H.R. 2500, Rep. Michael Oxley's (R-Ohio)
Superfund reform bill, could render HWIR moot. Officials
with the Environmental Technology Council (ETC) oppose this
portion of the bill because it would allow states to adopt
provisions freeing the management of remediation waste from
RCRA's Subtitle C requirements or the Toxic Substance
Control Act.

   "We believe some modified national standards for hot
spots makes sense for Superfund and RCRA waste," said ETC
Executive Director Doug MacMillan. "If the bill passes,
there will be no purpose to go forward with the [HWIR]
contaminated media rule" to be proposed soon.

   Superfund reforms also could severely hamper marketing
innovative technologies for hazardous waste this year. Bills
in the House and Senate largely favor closing off a
hazardous site rather than seeking permanent remediation,
MacMillan said. "That will be a serious disincentive for
innovative site cleanup technology," he said. "Why worry
about detoxifying waste if you can fence a site off or
provide alternatives to water supply?"

   EPA anticipates proposing its hazardous waste combustion
strategy this year, which has been a bone of contention in
recent years between hazardous waste incinerators and cement
kilns. The agency is slated to propose emission standards
for cement kilns and to determine proper handling of cement
kiln dust. "If EPA could get some realistic, applicable
standards for air emissions and for combustion residues, the
long-running controversies would die down," MacMillan said.
"That would be positive because the arguments between the
various groups have eroded the general public's confidence
about combustion."

LAND DISPOSAL RESTRICTIONS
H.R. 2036 APPROVED IN COMMITTEE;
BILL REQUIRES REPORT ON RELEASES


   EPA next year may ask particular landfills and treatment
systems accepting treated hazardous waste to provide data
for a five-year study on the threat of the sites' waste
stream to human health and the environment.

   The House Commerce Committee Dec. 21 passed H.R. 2036,
the Land Disposal Flexibility Act, with relatively minor
amendments. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Michael Oxley (R-
Ohio), passed the committee's Commerce, Trade and Hazardous
Materials Subcommittee in November (HWN, Dec. 11, 1995, p.
394).

   The measure would allow EPA to set land disposal
standards now prohibited by a federal court decision. The
agency in 1990 exempted from Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA) standards treated hazardous waste at
treatment systems regulated under the Clean Water Act and
nonhazardous deep injection wells regulated under the Clean
Drinking Water Act. In 1992, however, the Washington, D.C.,
District Court directed EPA to apply RCRA standards to these
wastes, which some industry officials said adds up to $800
million annually in compliance costs.

   Democrats worked extensively with Republican committee
members to pass the bill to the House floor, with Rep.
Blanche Lambert Lincoln (D-Ark.) working with Oxley to
address many Democratic concerns. The committee passed an
amendment offered by Lincoln calling for EPA to complete
within five years a study on these sites to determine if
releases are threatening the ground water or human health.
Ranking Democrat Rep. John Dingell (Mich.) warned that
setting a deadline on the study could lead to further court
action, yet did not oppose Lincoln's amendment.

   Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) expressed the strongest
opposition to the bill, calling for an EPA study completed
within three years, whereupon the agency must take action on
the study's findings. Wastewaters from these sites can have
concentrations of toxins up to 99 times drinking water
standards, thereby necessitating quick action on these risk
reports, he said. "Decharacterized waste containing
hazardous constituents may leak from surface impoundments at
the same levels of concerns as listed waste streams,"
Pallone said.

   Several members opposed the amendment, saying it would
require EPA to depend on old data to meet the three-year
deadline, and would force the agency to spend more time and
resources on waste that does not cause a significant threat
to the environment. Committee members sought to push the
bill through Congress before Jan. 17, the court-issued
deadline for the EPA rules to take affect. Contact: Nandan
Kenkeremath, majority counsel, (202) 226-2424.

DIOXIN
ASME REPORT FINDS MINIMAL LINKAGE
BETWEEN CHLORINE, DIOXIN EMISSIONS


   No significant correlation is shown between the type or
amount of chlorine in waste burned in hazardous waste
combustors (HMCs) and the concentrations of dioxin and furan
emissions (PCDD/F) measured at the stack, according to a
recent study by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers
(ASME).

   ASME analyzed more than 1,900 test results of hazardous,
solid, biomass and medical waste combustors. Limiting the
chlorine content of combustor feedstocks has little or no
effect on the composition or quantity of dioxin emitted,
states the report, The Relationship Between Chlorine in
Waste Streams and Dioxin Emissions from Waste Combustor
Stacks.

   HMCs studied in the report include hazardous waste
incinerators (HWIs), fired boilers and cement kilns. The
concentration of chlorine in the feed stocks for the
generators ranges from less than 0.1 percent for many
biomass combustors up to 80 percent for some HWIs, the study
says. The tests were done at 169 facilities - including 74
hazardous waste combustors - where chlorine and PCDD/F
emissions were measured.

   PCDD/F and chlorine were "simultaneously characterized"
at 107 units in 90 facilities. The data was checked to
identify errors and statistical problems, standardized to
reflect common reference conditions and analyzed to
determine if either the composition of PCDD/F concentrations
or the quantity of those composition changed, ASME states in
the report.

   Tests in 72 waste facilities showed no significant
relationship between chlorine input and PCDD/F measured in
the gas streams. In many of the tests, the combustion units
were "spiked" with larger amounts of chlorinated plastics,
or polyvinyl chloride, to determine if a higher chlorine
content in the waste fuel produced any measure of dioxin,
ASME explains. Cement kilns "displayed no apparent stack gas
PCDD/F concentration increase with increasing chlorine feed
rate," the report states. The result "is not surprising,
since chlorine is frequently added to remove natural alkalis
and produce Portland cement meeting federal and state
construction standards," ASME says.

   The study was not intended to evaluate control systems
performance, generate new data, assess the relationship
between PCDD/F and chlorine in liquid effluents or solid
residues, or to evaluate the removal of particulate-bound
PCDD/F in emission control devices, ASME says.

   "The failure to find simultaneous increases in most
cases, and finding a few inverse relationships, indicates
that whatever effect feed chlorine has on PCDD/F
concentrations in flue gases, it is smaller than the
influence of other causative factors," the society states in
the report. "Any effect chlorine has on PCDD/F
concentrations in commercial scale systems is a factor of
air pollution control system temperature, ash chemistry,
combustion conditions, imprecise measurement and localized
flow stratification." For a copy of the 663-page report,
contact John Varrasi, ASME, (212) 705-8158.

SUPERFUND
LOVE CANAL AGREEMENT EXEMPLIFIES
NEED FOR QUICKER SETTLEMENTS: CMA


   Some chemical industry analysts hope congressional
reforms to Superfund encourage responsible parties to pay
cleanup costs more swiftly, saying a settlement last month
for remediation costs at the infamous Love Canal Superfund
site in New York typifies the need for quicker action.

   The Occidental Chemical Corp. Dec. 21 agreed to pay $129
million over four years to EPA and the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) to cover cleanup costs at the Love
Canal site. Under the settlement, EPA will receive $102
million, and FEMA, which relocated area residents and began
site cleanup, will get $27 million.

   Occidental's corporate predecessor, Hooker Chemicals &
Plastics Corp., buried more than 20,000 tons of chemical
waste from 1942 to 1953. Although a housing development
later was built on the site, hundreds of families were
forced to leave these homes in the late 1970s to allow crews
to remediate the site. The site's cleanup costs eventually
lead to the creation of Superfund in 1980.

   In addition, New York originally sought $630 million in
damages from Occidental, but the company in 1994 agreed to
pay the state $98 million. Occidental's suits with the city
of Niagara Falls and several former residents still are
pending.

   "This reaffirms the definite need to move on legislative
reforms so we don't have these cases hanging around for 11
or 12 years," said Chemical Manufacturers Association
spokesman Matt Weinstock, who doubts the settlement will
spark other large Superfund payback agreements. "I'd like to
think things will continue on a case-by-case basis."

   A key EPA official agreed the Superfund program needs
genuine reform, yet not as stringent as Republican bills
proposed in Congress. "We need to speed cleanups and lower
costs so that more property can be returned to communities
for productive use," said EPA Region 2 Administrator Jeanne
Fox. "The lessons learned at Love Canal have been
successfully applied at hundreds of abandoned waste sites
around the country, where toxic threats to public health
have been removed."

   Claims in GOP reform bills stating 40 percent of taxpayer
funding for Superfund goes to litigation are untrue, Fox
said. "That figure refers to the legal costs to private
parties involved in suits and countersuits, often with their
insurance companies," she added. Contact: Howard Collins,
Occidental, (310) 443-6523.

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS
BAN ON U.S. IMPORT OF PCBS PROVOKES
CANADIAN COMPANIES TO SUE MINISTRY


   An Ohio company's recent exemption from EPA to import
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from Canada for treatment
led the Canadian government to ban PCB exports from Canada.
Several Canadian companies, in turn, have filed a lawsuit
against Canada's Environment Ministry.

   EPA Nov. 15 granted S.D. Myers, an Ohio-based hazardous
waste treatment firm, a special exemption to import PCBs for
treatment at the firm's Talmadge, Ohio, plant. The next day,
Sheila Copps, Canada's environment minister, issued an
interim ban on the company's exportation of the carcinogenic
chemicals, said Dana Myers, president of S.D. Myers.

   The Environment Ministry bowed to pressure from the
Canadian hazardous waste treatment industry, particularly
Chem-Security, a large Edmonton, Alberta-based firm, Myers
said. Officials from Chem-Security could not be reached for
comment. Prior to the ban, the Canadian government granted
Myers permission to import PCBs with EPA's approval.
"Environment Canada asked EPA to open the borders" to PCBs,
Myers said. "After EPA did, Canada slammed them shut."

   After the Environment Ministry issued the interim ban,
two Canadian firms, General Waste Transport Inc. and the
Quebec Center for the Environment, sued the Environment
Ministry Dec. 19 to lift the ban. The Environment Ministry
issued the ban under the Canadian Environmental Protection
Act. Copps implemented an interim ban from one rule and
applied it to a different rule, which invalidates the ban,
Myers told HWN.

   The companies are bringing Copps and Canadian Attorney
General Allan Rock to court on two separate grounds. First,
Copps did not have the authority to enact the ban because
human health is not threatened with the transport of PCBs
across national borders, said Douglas Hamilton, a partner in
the Toronto firm of Osler & Hoskin, and the attorney
representing General Waste Transport. The ban also would
retain Chem-Security's monopoly of the Canadian PCB
remediation market, thus invalidating the ban, Myers added.
The firms are reviewing Environment Ministry procedures in
implementing the ban to determine if it had the necessary
backing of the Ministry of Health, Hamilton said.
Environment Ministry officials could not be reached for
comment. Contact: Dana Myers, S.D. Myers, (216) 633-2666;

CIEC BIOSOLIDS TECHNOLOGY CUTS NOX
EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA CEMENT KILNS


   The Cement Industry Environmental Consortium (CIEC)
recently unveiled its biosolids injection technology, which
reduces nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and disposes
wastewater sludge.

   The process uses ammonia in the sludge to convert NOx
into a stable, non-toxic gas, CIEC officials said. The
technology mixes sludge with combustion gases from cement
kilns.

   The consortium now is testing the process at the
Mitsubishi Cement Corp. plant in Cushenbury, Calif., the
state's largest cement plant. Use of biosolids injection has
reduced NOx emissions by 45 percent, while treating 10
percent of Southern California's wastewater sludge, CIEC
said.

   Biosolids injection can help cement kilns meet strict
Clean Air Act standards, CIEC said. Contact: Robert Kahn,
CIEC, (206) 236-7200.

CHICAGO BROWNFIELDS FORUM RELEASES
MODEL FINANCING GUIDELINES FOR BANKS


   The Chicago Brownfields Forum (CBF), seeking ways to make
brownfield redevelopment more feasible, last month released
model lending guidelines that may spur bankers to invest in
more abandoned industrial properties.

   The model is designed to allow banks and lending
institutions to extend credit to redevelopment projects,
while protecting the bank's collateral interest and loan
repayment, CBF officials said. The model identifies policies
and procedures lending institutions can follow in financing
redevelopment projects.

   The city-organized forum consists of more than 100 public
and private representatives, including real estate
developers, industry representatives, environmentalists,
government agencies and community groups.

   Chapman & Cutler, a Chicago law firm, led the task force
crafting the guidelines. Banks can adopt the model to
existing policy to initiate financing redevelopment
projects, CBF officials said. Brownfield financing has
suffered because lending institutions did not know which
questions to ask developers, so developers did not know what
information to submit, officials said. The package includes
specific requirements developers must satisfy, with forms
and examples.

   CBF developed the policy as an example for other states
with voluntary cleanup plans. Future models will address
financing in states that have no voluntary cleanup program,
CBF officials said. Contact: Bill Trumbull, CBF, (312) 744-
5711.


   COLORADO - The Broomfield City Council last month opposed
a plan to bury hazardous waste at the former Rocky Flats
nuclear weapons plant, near Boulder. In November, the
Department of Energy (DOE) and Kaiser Hill, a DOE
contractor, proposed to expedite cleanup and closure of the
plant. According to the plan, workers would remove the most
hazardous radioactive waste, but low-level waste would be
buried on-site at the plant. Last month, the council passed
a resolution opposing this proposal. The council also sent a
letter to the state officials overseeing the cleanup.
Contact: Patrick Etchart, DOE, (303) 966-5993.

   HAWAII - EPA last month fined the Department of Interior
(DOI), National Parks Service for violating the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) by storing hazardous
waste at the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The facility
stored hazardous waste without a RCRA permit between March
and October. The waste contained acetone, chromium, lead,
xylene, phenol, arsenic and mercury. EPA also cited DOI for
storing waste in rusted, leaking containers. EPA fined the
facility $243,800 and ordered it to develop a hazardous
waste management plan within two months. Contact: Lois
Grunwald, EPA, (415) 744-1588.

   OHIO - EPA last month completed cleanup at the Coshocton
City Landfill Superfund site in Franklin Township. The
remediation activities included construction of a landfill
gas collection and venting system, construction of a
landfill cap, and ground water monitoring. Potentially
responsible parties completed all work, with oversight from
EPA and Ohio state officials. EPA will review the site every
five years as required by law. From 1968-1979, the site was
used as an 80-acre landfill, which accepted various
industrial wastes from several local companies. The site was
added to the National Priorities List in 1983. Contact:
Anthony Rutter, EPA, (312)886-8961.

   MICHIGAN - EPA last month reached agreement with Dow
Chemical Co. for alleged hazardous waste violations at the
company's Midland facility. The agency cited the firm in
September 1993 for failing to meet Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act requirements governing burning hazardous waste
in a boiler. The company failed to develop a written plan to
analyze the hazardous waste burned; failed to determine ash,
chlorine and chloride concentrations in the waste fed to
boilers; and failed to check for leaks in boiler valves, EPA
said. EPA's consent order called for a $167,000 fine and for
Dow to correct the violations. Contact: Michael Cunningham,
EPA, (312) 886-4464.

   WASHINGTON - The Department of Energy (DOE) last month
gave Westinghouse Hanford Co. (WHC) a "good" performance
rating for the six months ending Sept. 30. DOE awarded the
company a grant of more than $1.5 million based on a
detailed department evaluation. This rating was a
significant improvement over the company's last rating of
satisfactory, DOE officials said. DOE cited improved
performance by WHC in tank remediation and facility
stabilization. DOE, however, noted deficiencies in
conducting an operations procedure for radiological control
and in establishing an effective field work procedures plan.

ERM CASE STUDY DEMONSTRATES NEED
FOR UNDERSTANDING OF PERMIT PROCESS


   Industrial plants can face overly burdensome water
quality-based effluent limits (WQBELs) without a clear
understanding of how regulating agencies determine these
limits and assess the data on which the limits are based,
according to a paper presented by William Hall, a senior
project manager with Environmental Resources Management
(ERM) Group.

   The paper, presented recently at the annual Water
Environment Federation conference, outlines how the
consulting firm negotiated with the Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Resources (DER) to set less-stringent
WQBELs for a client. The new limits should be less costly
than a draft National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit DER originally prepared for an electronic
components manufacturer, states Hall's study, Negotiating
Less Conservative Water Based Effluent Limits: A Case Study.

   The draft included WQBELs for copper and lead, as well as
fluoride limits based on historical performance. After
studying the draft limits, ERM concluded these limits were
too conservative, and the company would struggle to comply
with them, the report states.

   The manufacturer discharged 330,000 gallons per day of
process wastewater into a large fresh water river. The
proposed fluoride limits included average monthly limits,
maximum daily limits and instantaneous maximum concentration
limits. A review of historical data of effluent discharge
showed the facility could not comply with the state's
average monthly limit, the study said.

   The WQBELs for copper and lead affected four discharge
streams in the facility - three process wastewater
discharges and a cooling water discharge. Studies showed the
plant's wastewater treatment operations, with improvements,
could easily handle the limits set for lead. However, the
company determined the draft copper limits were three times
lower than the best treatment technology could provide, the
study says.

   The low draft limits stemmed partially from
misconceptions about mineral hardness, or concentration, in
the river. ERM recorded the river's hardness data per month.
River hardness peaked during the late summer and early fall,
which coincided with low effluent flow from the plant, ERM
concluded. DER, therefore, raised the WQBEL for copper in
the permit.

   Moreover, ERM determined the slope of the receiving
river, or the difference in elevation between two points
along the river, was less steep where effluent enters than
at other sections along the river. A mild slope gives the
effluent less time to travel downstream and a greater chance
to disperse in a smaller area, the report says.

   DER has since raised the WQBEL for copper from 0.18
milligrams per liter (mg/l) to 0.47 mg/l. DER also raised
the lead limit from 0.29 mg/l to 0.43 mg/l, thereby removing
lead as a water quality-based parameter. DER also raised the
company's average monthly limit for fluoride 2.5 times the
normal limit, the study says.

   "What this case study clearly illustrates is that a
regulatory authority is not responsible for establishing
optimum parameters value to maximize effluent limits while
trying to protect the environment," the report says. "That
responsibility lies with the permittee." The paper is free
from ERM by contacting Dorothy Condon, (610) 524-3657.

***************
SLANTS & TRENDS
***************


THE ASSOCIATION of American Railroads (AAR) last month
completed the consolidation of hazmat and other research
facilities at its Transportation Technology Center (TTC) in
Pueblo, Colo. As part of the consolidation, AAR closed its
Chicago Technical Center (CTC) at the Illinois Institute of
Technology. Thirty CTC employees were relocated to the TTC.

'CONSOLIDATION of our TTC and CTC facilities will result in
annual savings of more than $2 million," AAR President Edwin
Harper said. "By combining AAR's rail research experts and
equipment at one location, we will increase our research
effectiveness and TTC's capacity to attract future research
and development projects."

* * *

PRESIDENT CLINTON entered office three years ago this month
pledging to make government more efficient. In keeping with
that promise, the Research and Special Programs
Administration (RSPA) has proposed placing administrative
procedure on its head. On non-controversial rules, RSPA will
promulgate first and ask for comments later (See story, p.
5).

* * *

QUOTE, UNQUOTE: "If a pilot ticketing program is
implemented, shippers should have the opportunity to contest
alleged violations by telephone as well as in writing. There
have been numerous occasions when letters of warning or
verbal warnings have been issued inappropriately due to
incorrect interpretation of the regulations by inspectors.
These enforcement errors can often be resolved over the
telephone. Under the proposed program it appears that the
relative ease of issuing tickets could result in more
penalties being proposed and that tickets could only be
contested in writing." - American Crop Protection
Association, commenting on a RSPA proposal to issue tickets
for minor hazmat transport violations.

* * *

RSPA SURVIVED 1995 INTACT. A Clinton administration proposal
to combine the Department of Transportation's 10 agencies
into three modal offices apparently got lost in the
legislative shuffle last year.

RSPA Clarifications

     Selective testing: Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee,
asked whether alternative closure methods for packages may
be used interchangeably without retesting, so long as the
packages provide an equivalent level of performance.

     RSPA responded that under the agency's Selective
Testing Variation 4 [Section 178.601(g)(ii) of the Hazardous
Materials Regulations], testing is not required when the
structural design of the tested-out packaging, including
methods of closure, "is maintained." The agency added,
"Thus, any change to the originally tested closure results
in a different packaging design type requiring design
qualification testing."

     Competent authority: The Glidden Co., Cleveland, asked
whether it would need a Competent Authority Permit Number
from the U.S. Transportation Department, and display that
number on all shipping papers, to export a product in RSPA-
approved UN1A2 (open-head) drums. The International Maritime
Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code generally requires shipments to
be made in steel, closed-head drums unless another type of
drum is permitted under competent authority.

     RSPA responded that so long as the U.S. company
complies with the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) it
has permission from competent authority and does not need
other documentation. "The RSPA associate administrator for
hazardous materials safety is the United States Competent
Authority for purposes of the IMDG Code," RSPA said. "The
provisions contained in the HMR constitute competent
authority approval for the United States for transportation
of hazardous materials in instances where the IMDG code ...
specifically permit[s] a variation based on the approval of
competent authority."

     Reportable quantity: The Technical Group Inc.,
Washington, asked whether it is better to rely on the
intended formulation "batch sheet" information or on the
actual laboratory analysis of the end product to determine
whether the lead content of a material meets or exceeds its
assigned reportable quantity of 10 pounds per package.

     RSPA said it is the shipper's duty to classify a hazmat
properly, and the agency "does not prescribe a particular
method a shipper must follow in determining whether a
material is a hazardous substance." Added RSPA: "If any
constituent equals or exceeds its listed RQ per package,
then the material meets the definition of a hazardous
substance. Therefore, if the amount of lead content in a
material equals or exceeds 10 pounds per package, the
material is a hazardous substance."

     Unflanged heads: New Progress Inc., Arthur, Ill., asked
whether Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations
permit cargo tanks with unflanged heads to be used to
transport hazmat. New Progress said if DOT rules allow, the
company would proceed with building chassis-mounted truck
tanks with unflanged heads.

     RSPA had bad news for the company: DOT regulations
prohibit the use of tanks with unflanged heads. "Unflanged
heads have no radius and are unacceptable," RSPA said.
"Flanged heads having a knuckle radius less than that
permitted by Section 178.346-1(d)(3) [of the Hazardous
Materials Regulations] also are not acceptable."

     Made in the USA: Olympic IBC Corp, Kirkland, Wash.,
asked whether it may apply the "USA" mark to bulk containers
the company primarily manufactures at its affiliate in
Mexico. Because it takes full responsibility for the
markings and the final step of manufacture is completed in
the United States, Olympic IBC said it believes the
containers may be marked USA.

     However, the company is wrong, RSPA said. Under the
agency's HM-215A rule, RSPA said, "A USA marked packaging
should be manufactured and marked only in the U.S." The rule
is published in the Dec. 29, 1994, Federal Register.

     Shipping, fueling: Consolidated Edison Company of New
York Inc., New York, asked whether the Hazardous Materials
Regulations, which apply to cylinders used as shipping
containers, apply to cylinders used as part of a system to
fuel a compressed natural gas-powered vehicle.

     "Cylinders used as fuel tanks for propulsion and not to
transport cargo are not subject to regulation under the
federal hazardous materials transportation law or the
Hazardous Materials Regulations," RSPA responded.

     "In addition, as long as those cylinders are mounted on
your vehicles and used only as fuel tanks, there is no legal
requirement to reinspect or retest them under the
exemption," the agency stated. "Therefore, you may make your
own determinations about what reinspections and retests are
necessary for safety purposes."

RSPA IMPROPERLY CEDES AUTHORITY
UNDER TICKET PROPOSAL, NPCA SAYS


     The Research and Special Programs Administration, in a
proposal to ticket hazmat violations that do not
substantially harm safety, improperly surrenders much of its
hazmat oversight responsibility to the U.S. Coast Guard, a
group of paint-makers, suppliers and distributors has told
RSPA.

     The National Paint and Coatings Association (NPCA) also
derided the proposal as ambiguous and a way to discourage
companies from paying fines, even as the group  praised RSPA
for trying to simplify hazmat enforcement procedures.
Nevertheless, the focus of the association's objections is
RSPA's proposal to have Coast Guard hearing officers handle
shippers' appeals of these tickets.

     Under the controversial proposal, RSPA inspectors would
be allowed to write tickets for violations that have "no
substantial impact on safety," including: operating under an
expired exemption, neglecting to register, failing to
maintain training records and not filing incident reports.
The tickets would state the facts supporting the alleged
violation and a penalty amount "substantially less than the
penalty that would be proposed under current procedures,"
RSPA stated.

Coast Guard Would Hear Cases

     Other provisions of RSPA's proposal would give alleged
violators the choice of paying the ticket or contesting the
proposed penalty within 30 days of receipt. Companies
contesting the ticket would have a hearing before a U.S.
Coast Guard hearing officer, a proposal NPCA derided as
unfair to industry.

     "Final resolution of alleged violations by the Coast
Guard, without any recourse back to RSPA, is troubling
because the industry is not familiar with Coast Guard
procedures and the industry is unsure of the Coast Guard's
familiarity with RSPA regulations and the practice of the
motor transportation industry," NPCA said.

     "Although the Coast Guard may have some expertise with
hazardous materials regulations as they relate to maritime
shipping, the Coast Guard has no history of interaction with
motor carriers," the group added. "Therefore, they are not
familiar with the general practices of the industry and this
fact will be an obstacle to a smooth resolution of these
cases."

     NPCA urged RSPA to increase its own role in the
proposal by giving alleged violators a right to appeal the
Coast Guard's decision to the RSPA administrator. After all,
RSPA would be the agency that enforces the Coast Guard's
ruling, the association added.

     "RSPA's desire to offload some of the burden of
handling 'insubstantial' violations through a ticketing
program...to better service cases or violations that do
concern safety issues is laudable," NPCA said. "However,
even in cases where there is no substantial impact on
safety, there may come a time during the resolution process
that the enforcing agency's office needs to examine the
case."

     In addition to its objection regarding the Coast
Guard's role, NPCA said RSPA has failed to define adequately
what the agency means by "no substantial impact" on safety.
"Although it does seem clear that the ticketing option will
only be used for the seemingly innocuous recordkeeping type
of violations, there is no built-in mechanism within the
proposal that clearly establishes succinct boundaries for
inclusion in the program," NPCA said.

Proposal Would Discourage Payment

     RSPA's proposal to permit minor violations to count
against a shipper's safety record, and thereby increase the
company's penalties for future violations, will discourage
the payment of fines. Companies, instead of paying the fines
immediately, would try their luck at a hearing, thereby
delaying payments, the association added.

     "If the ticketing proposal is meant to be a streamlined
method of dealing with 'insubstantial' violations and will
result in a certain percentage of cases being moved away
from RSPA, RSPA will want to encourage companies to
participate in this new streamlined process," NPCA said.

     "If, however, companies learn that the most innocuous
'insubstantial' violations will result in escalating fines
or other ramifications (like an increase in insurance
premiums because of a number of tickets, being published in
the year-end report of violations with a list of tickets),
there will be no incentive to pay the ticket," NPCA added.
"Faced with escalating fines or other ramifications, most
companies will choose to contest the ticket."

     RSPA's ticket proposal was published in the Aug. 21
Federal Register. Contact: RSPA's Office of Chief Counsel,

PE%A ANNOUNCES DELAY
IN NAFTA CROSSINGS


     Approval for trucking companies wishing to conduct
cross-border traffic between the United States and Mexico
under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is on
hold until U.S. and Mexican transportation officials meet
and further "improve safety and security measures,"
Department of Transportation (DOT) Secretary Federico Pe$a
said Dec. 18.

     Under NAFTA, Mexican and U.S. truckers were to be
allowed to cross the border and operate throughout those
U.S. and Mexican states along the border starting Dec. 18.

     Mexican drivers wanting to operate past the up-to-15-
mile commercial zone must file for approval from the
Interstate Commerce Commission's successor agency. Though
that agency, the Surface Transportation Board, will take
applications from Mexican truckers, approval will be
withheld until safety meetings occur, Pe$a said.

Mexico: Move Violates NAFTA

     Since the announcement, the Mexican government wrote to
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor declaring the U.S.
delay a violation of the principles of the agreement and
threatening to file a complaint under NAFTA's enforcement
mechanism. U.S. officials expressed surprise about the
Mexican complaints, saying the Mexican government knew of
the U.S. intent far in advance.

     And, said Kantor in a return letter excerpted in The
Washington Post, despite the Mexicans' concerns, "we must
first and foremost ensure the safety and security of our
citizens."

     The trucking industry, cautiously concerned when Pe$a
first announced the delay, became "outraged" as the week
went on, said Linda Bauer-Darr, vice president of
international relations at the American Trucking
Associations (ATA). "Obviously, there is no deadline" to end
the delay, Bauer-Darr said. "Obviously [the delay] was
brought about because of political pressures.

     "This is not a good way to be conducting business ...
with our important trading partners," Bauer-Darr said.

     As Dec. 18 approached, safety advocates such as
Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways (CRASH) and unions
such as the International Brotherhood of Teamsters stepped
up protests to the pending opening of the border.

     The groups contend Mexican trucks do not meet state and
federal standards regarding safety, weight or insurance and
that Mexican drivers are not sufficiently trained in hazmat
procedures. They also contend state and federal officials in
the United States are not sufficiently staffed, funded or
prepared to enforce U.S. safety standards on the Mexican
trucks. Officials in the four border states - Arizona,
California, New Mexico and Texas - share those worries.

     Giving in to pressure from those groups will hurt the
U.S. trucking industry in the long run, Bauer-Darr said.
"This is going to play very dangerously when it comes to
other pending trade issues with Mexico," she added.

     U.S. and Mexican negotiators are trying to work out
disputes over such issues as small-package delivery, wheat-
transportation rules and the use of 53-foot trailers in
Mexico.

     "This delay destroys any political leverage [the United
States] had at all," Bauer-Darr said. "Here we're saying
it's very important for [Mexico] to live up to its NAFTA
commitments, but then we don't live up to ours."

     The labor and safety groups were "cautiously
optimistic" about the delay. "The delay is good news ...
only if it means that Mexico will ultimately raise its
truck-safety standards to meet our own," said CRASH
Executive Director Jack Rendler. "Our government should be
doing more, not less, to address truck safety, and NAFTA
should not result in any loosening of U.S. truck-safety
standards.

     Despite the delay on the open-border rule, other
actions took effect Dec. 18 as scheduled, such as the cross-
investment rule, which permits U.S. trucking companies to
invest in their Mexican counterparts, and vice versa.

RSPA PROPOSES EXPEDITED PROCEDURE
FOR ISSUING NON-CONTROVERSIAL RULES


     The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA)
Dec. 18 - in what would be a break from usual regulatory
procedure - proposed a new system of issuing rules in non-
controversial areas first and then inviting interested
parties to submit their objections.

     Under the usual procedure, RSPA - like other federal
agencies - proposes rules and invites the public to comment
on the proposals. Only after the time for comments has
expired does the agency issue its regulations.

     However, in an effort to make the agency more
efficient, RSPA has proposed bypassing the notice-and-
comment period by publishing "non-controversial" rules in
the Federal Register and then seeking input from parties who
object to the rules. If RSPA does not receive a "significant
adverse comment" or notice that a party intends to file an
objection by a certain date, the rule would go into effect.

Agency Defines 'Non-Controversial'

     In its proposed procedural change, RSPA defined non-
controversial rules as those that effect minor, substantive
changes to regulations; incorporate by reference the latest
edition of technical or industry standards; or extend
compliance dates.

     The agency also defined significant adverse comment as
a statement from an interested party that explains why the
rule is inappropriate, ineffective or unacceptable.

     "Comments that are frivolous or insubstantial would not
be considered adverse under this procedure," RSPA said. "A
comment recommending a rule change in addition to the rule
would not be considered a significant adverse comment,
unless the commenter states why the rule would be
ineffective without the additional change."

     Parties wishing to comment on RSPA's proposed "direct-
final-rule" procedure must do so by Feb. 16. For more
information, contact: Nancy Machado of RSPA's chief-counsel
office, (202) 366-4400.

     RSPA's proposal is published in the Dec. 18 Federal
Register, p. 65210. The three-page proposal also is
available via BPI's DocuDial Service% as #75-1102. To order,
see page 6.

EFFORTS TO ACCELERATE TIMETABLE
FOR RADWASTE SHIPMENTS QUICKEN


     Efforts to accelerate the timetable for shipping high-
level radioactive waste cross-country seems to be gathering
steam, despite opposition from the Clinton administration.

     Under the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), the
Department of Energy (DOE) must begin accepting high-level
waste from U.S. nuclear power plants by 1998. However, DOE
is behind schedule in constructing a permanent storage
facility, slated for Yucca Mountain, Nevada.

     Next month, the House may vote on legislation (H.R.
1020) that would require DOE to open an interim storage
facility at Yucca Mountain. Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.)
introduced similar legislation (S. 167) in the Senate, but
that measure has stalled. Both bills call for the interim
facility to begin accepting waste by 1998, but several
issues must be resolved before the shipments can begin.

O'Leary Cites Concerns

     Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary Dec. 14 told the Senate
Energy and Natural Resources Committee the administration
could not support proposals siting the interim facility at
Yucca Mountain until it finishes suitability studies on the
permanent repository. However, O'Leary said DOE could
complete its suitability determination by the end of 1998,
and, if Yucca Mountain appears suitable, the agency may
consider building an interim facility.

     That day, Sen. Rod Grams (R-Minn.) introduced a bill
(S. 1478) to privatize interim storage, a proposal backed by
nuclear-power interests in his home state. Grams' bill would
let a private consortium build and operate an interim
storage facility and allow DOE to contract with the
consortium for waste storage. The facility would be built on
government-owned land, probably in Nevada.

     "For 16 years, DOE has been charged with the
responsibility of our civilian spent fuel," Grams said. "In
that time, DOE has spent nearly $5 billion of ratepayers'
money, including over $250 million from Minnesota's electric
customers...Privatizing the interim storage program would
improve efficiency and lower costs to the taxpayers."

     But most in the nuclear industry are pinning their
hopes on DOE building an interim facility. "It
[privatization] would be a last resort," said Scott Peters
of the Nuclear Energy Institute.

RSPA Appeals Action

RSPA Ref. No. 90-82-SB. In the Matter of Morton
International Inc., Respondent.

Background

     On Aug. 16, 1991, the Research and Special Programs
Administration (RSPA) fined Morton International $2,000 for
having knowingly violated several sections of the Hazardous
Materials Regulations (HMR). These provisions included 49
CFR 171.2(a), 171.2(c), 172.202(a)(1), 172.202(a)(2), and
173.102.

     RSPA reduced to $2,000 a $3,500 fine the agency
proposed in an Aug. 23, 1990, Notice of Probable Violation.
The company appealed the $2,000 fine.

Discussion

     Morton International conceded RSPA's finding that the
company had violated HMR by failing to mark "DOT 12B" on
each side of the package. But the company contested RSPA's
other findings.

     RSPA said the company was required to meet all mandates
of Exemption DOT E 8214 when offering hazmat for interstate
transportation pursuant to the exemption. Failing that, the
shipments had to meet HMR mandates, the agency added.

     RSPA charged Morton International with violating the
HMR by failing to mark properly its otherwise complying
packagings with the "12B" specification.

     RSPA said Morton International knowingly offered hazmat
for transport in commerce in unauthorized, non-DOT
specification packaging, in violation of Exemption DOT E
8214 and 49 CFR 171.2(a) and 173.102. The company said the
hazmat was part of a shipment from Utah to California, where
it was awaiting transfer to Japan.

     Morton International argued the International Air
Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulations
govern movement of the material to Japan and said these
regulations prohibit "double marking" of packages with
United Nations (UN) markings and DOT markings. The company
said this prohibition on dual UN and DOT markings barred it
from placing the otherwise necessary "DOT 12B" markings on
the packages.

     However, RSPA said the company was wrong in believing
that IATA regulations control movement of the packages and
that a prohibition exists on DOT markings on packages
offered for international transportation. The International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Technical Instructions
govern international transport of hazmat and permit dual
markings, RSPA added.

     Even if dual markings were prohibited, Morton
International's violations concern the offering of material
for transportation from Utah to California; that is within
the United States, RSPA said. If a prohibition on dual
markings on international shipments did exist, the company
would still be required to mark the packages with the
requisite DOT specification marking for interstate trans-
portation within the United States and to make any necessary
modifications before offering the packages for international
transportation, RSPA added.

     Because Morton International did not comply with the
DOT exemption, it was required to comply with the HMR, and
its violation lay in its failure to comply with the HMR,
RSPA said. While it met the basic requirements of the "DOT
12B" specification, the company failed to meet with the HMR
because it did not mark the packages with the "12B"
specification, RSPA said.

Findings

     "I find that a civil penalty of $1,500 is appropriate
in light of the nature and circumstances of these
violations, their extent and gravity, respondent's
culpability, respondent's lack of prior violations,
respondent's ability to pay, the effect of a civil penalty
on respondent's ability to continue in business, and all
other relevant factors," RSPA administrator D.K. Sharma
said.

NTSB COUNTS HEAD SHIELDS, COUPLERS
AS BEING AMONG ITS TOP ACHIEVEMENTS


     The National Transportation Safety Board counts the
NTSB-inspired requirement that railroad tank cars
transporting hazmat be equipped with head shields and shelf
couplers as being among its greatest achievements.

     In a recent report, NTSB said these safety features
have dramatically reduced the number of tank-car explosions
and ruptures during the past 10 years. Nevertheless, NTSB
warned the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), railroads
and shippers to remain vigilant.

     "The danger still exists, and accidents still occur,"
NTSB wrote in its report We Are All Safer: NTSB Improvements
in Transportation Safety. The report detailed NTSB studies
on freight-railroad accidents and resulting board
recommendations the federal government or private sector has
adopted. These agency and corporate steps have enhanced
transportation safety, NTSB said.

NTSB Praises Railroads

     For example, NTSB praised the railroad industry for
responding to board suggestions by improving communication
with communities near railyards and rail routes. In
addition, FRA, the Association of American Railroads and
locomotive manufacturers have met to establish a program to
gather data on fuel-tank damage and fuel spills.

     The board singled out CSX Transportation (CSXT) for
special praise for its response to a 1989 derailment and
butane spill in Akron, Ohio. Based on NTSB recommendations,
CSXT began training its railroad crews to assist emergency
personnel responding to hazmat spills and to require crews
to keep up-to-date listings of where the hazmat-containing
cars are on trains, the agency added.

     NTSB also hailed the Chemical Manufacturers Association
for requiring its members to have a chemical-risk management
program to evaluate risks of spills and implement ways to
reduce the chances of hazmat leaks. CMA's actions followed a
1981 NTSB study that found 2,121 railroad accidents
involving hazmat resulted in the evacuation of 100,000
people.

     In that study, the board also examined 45 railroad
accidents. "In at least 21 of the 45 cases investigated for
the study, the safety board found that local emergency
response incident commanders did not have a hazardous-
materials emergency-response plan to follow, and in 19 of
the cases, incident commanders and railroad personnel had
not been in contact with each other to develop a plan of
action in the event of a train accident involving hazardous
materials," NTSB stated.

     For more information, contact: NTSB, Public Affairs
Office, Washington, DC 20594; (202) 382-0660.

CLINTON NOMINATES GEORGIAN
FOR TRANSPORT SAFETY BOARD


     President Clinton last month nominated George Black, a
Georgia county transportation director, for the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

     Black, director of Gwinnett County's transportation
department since 1988, has investigated more than 1,500
highway crashes. As director, he has overseen the design,
construction, maintenance and operation of the county's
roads and its airport.

     "Mr. Black's qualifications and experience as a civil
engineer will provide the NTSB with the technical expertise
necessary to evaluate complex highway, bridge-design and
maintenance issues," read a White House statement. Black's
nomination awaits Senate confirmation.

U.S. HAZMAT REGS PREEMPT
NEW YORK RULES, RSPA SAYS


     The U.S. Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) preempt
New York state rules that ban the repackaging of hazardous
wastes, require a statement on the manifest of waste
transfers between vehicles and mandate secondary containment
in defined containers for the storage or transfer of hazmat,
the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA)
stated last month.

     RSPA, which enforces HMR, concluded the federal rules
trump New York's after weighing the Chemical Waste
Transportation Institute's (CWTI's) challenge to the state
regulation. In a petition to RSPA, CWTI said the New York
Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR) are not "substantively
the same as" the federal regulations and are therefore
invalid under the federal Hazardous Materials Transportation
Act.

     In its decision, RSPA agreed with CWTI's argument that
the NYCRR goes beyond HMR by imposing an absolute
prohibition on repackaging hazardous waste. HMR, unlike the
New York rule, allows for some repackaging, such as the
consolidation of some loads from cargo tanks to tank cars,
RSPA said.

State Went Too Far

     New York also went too far in requiring all hazardous
waste transfers to be listed on manifests, RSPA found.
Federal rules require only that the transporter's company
name and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
identification number appear on the manifest.

     Finally, RSPA objected to New York's requirement that
hazmat be transferred between vehicles only in containers
with impervious bases and drainage and capacity limits. HMR
contains general requirements that the containers be impact-
resistant for the minimum and maximum temperatures
encountered during transportation.

     Before RSPA would consider its challenge to New York,
CWTI had to survive a challenge from New York. The state
urged RSPA to ignore CWTI's petition, saying the group
lacked standing to oppose the state regulation because none
of its members has been hurt by the controversial rule.

     New York, joined by Pennsylvania and Montana, said CWTI
is primarily concerned with hazmat transportation, and the
state regulations in question concern toxins that are merely
waiting to be transported. CWTI countered that many of its
members have refused to engage in certain hazmat-related
activities in New York, lest they be fined heavily for
running afoul of the state rules.

     RSPA, ruling in favor of CWTI, said hazmat awaiting
transportation is still governed by the HMR provisions
governing shipments. The New York rules and HMR, therefore,
affect CWTI members, allowing the group to challenge the
state regulations, RSPA said.

     "Where loading, unloading or storage occurs incidental
to the movement of property in commerce, that activity is
within the scope of federal law governing the transportation
of hazardous material and the HMR," RSPA said. "Requirements
affecting transportation facilities, and transporters'
activities at those facilities, are subject to federal
preemption." For more information, contact Frazer Hilder of
RSPA's chief-counsel office, (202) 366-4400. RSPA's decision
is published in the Dec. 6 Federal Register, p. 62527.

MACHINERY ADVANCES ABET GAINS IN HDPE BLOWN FILM

By:
MICHAEL C. GABRIELE

Spurred by ongoing technical innovations, favorable cost comparisons with
paper and other resin systems, and growing end-use markets, high-density
polyethylene blown film production will register strong annual growth rates
during the next five years.
   North America, Asia, and Latin America are identified as prime growth
markets for HDPE film, while the more mature Western European market is
steady but less robust. Many equipment suppliers say Eastern Europe is
developing as an especially fertile sector for HDPE film growth.

Suppliers project strong growth for HDPE film
   Equipment suppliers are unanimous in their bullish forecast for the
growth of HDPE film. They say many processors, especially those in the
U.S., are set to embark on significant expansion in their production
capabilities over the next 24 months.
   Processors are looking to upgrade the quality of their operations and
film products by utilizing a host of incremental technical innovations.
Many of these capital investments will involve processing lines for
``high-stalk,'' coextrusion high-molecular weight HDPE.
   HDPE film sales in North America are projected to grow at a healthy
average annual rate in excess of 20% during the next five years, sources
say. Much of this increase in business will come at the expense of LDPE and
paper, in various packaging applications.
   An industry source at a major polyolefin resin producer estimates the
total U.S. market for HDPE film in 1995 was upwards of 1.5 billion lb.,
with a value in excess of $1 billion. About 150 billion HDPE film bags were
produced last year for four major market categories: grocery ``T-shirt''
sacks; thin-film industrial can liners; consumer garbage bags; and general
consumer product merchandise bags.
   Eastern Europe is cited by several equipment suppliers as a vibrant
growth sector for the production of HDPE film. Many processors in the
emerging market economies of Eastern Europe are moving aggressively to
invest in high-stalk, coextruded HMW-HDPE film lines, which typically carry
a price tag in excess of $2 million.
   Machinery builders point out that HDPE film's ability to be downgaged
yet maintain physical properties is one factor that will continue to fuel
its growth in both consumer and industrial packaging and insulating
applications.
   ``You can't downgage LDPE or LLDPE like HDPE and still maintain desired
levels of tensile strength,'' David Nunes, president of Alpine American,
Natick, MA, says. ``Also, paper prices are skyrocketing, while the demand
for T-shirt bags is growing at an extraordinary rate.''
   Sources say U.S. paper prices are five times higher than HDPE film in
applications such as T-shirt bags. Recent reports quote the price of 70-lb.
unbleached kraft grocery sack paper at $590 a ton, with supplies tight and
prices expected to continue rising in the near term.

Demand for grooved-feed extruders is picking up
   Joseph Altimari, executive vice president, Black Clawson-Sano Inc.,
Amelia, OH, says his firm's recent marketing alliance with Spanish
machinery builder Covex R.S. Extrusion S.A., of Barcelona, will seek to
capitalize on the growing market demand for grooved-feed extruders for HDPE
blown film. Black Clawson-Sano last spring acquired the exclusive rights to
market Covex HDPE film systems in North America.
   The grooved-feed extruders provide stronger, more consistent, and
predictable extrusion rates compared with smooth-bore types. However,
Altimari points out grooved-feed results in higher wear rates on machines.
To remedy this, Covex has come up with a novel, proprietary groove design
that reduces back pressure and wear in the feed zone.
   Covex film lines utilize an extruder design that reduces screw r.p.m. by
as much as 25 to 50%, compared with existing standard machines, yet
maintains equivalent film output levels, according to Altimari. In
addition, Covex has introduced a bi-layer die design with a single
extruder, which is said to orient HDPE film to help prevent the ``zipper
tear'' effect.
   Paul Kiefel Extrusionstechnik GmbH, Wrentham, MA, and Reifenhauser Inc.,
Peabody, MA, each offer 100-mm. grooved-feed extruders aimed at the T-shirt
bag market. The machines are capable of output rates over 1000 lb./hr.
Alpine is testing a 120-mm. extruder for HDPE, which has been adapted from
an LDPE film system. The design will allow processors to run both HDPE and
LDPE.
   Reifenhauser has unveiled an internal bubble cooling (IBC) technology,
which induces more ``neck-in'' for the stalk or neck of a film bubble.
Matthew Bangert, vice president of sales, explains the IBC system decreases
the neck diameter of the film bubble, just below the frost line. This
enables processors to use larger dies to boost output rates without
sacrificing the desired physical properties of the film.
   Bangert says the technology achieves up to 30% neck-in for the bubble
stalk; the typical neck-in range for most film lines is 5 to 15%.
   Battenfeld Gloucester, Gloucester, MA, recently delivered an enhanced
blown film ``swing'' line to an unnamed U.S. customer, which provides the
capability to change die diameters for the processing of either
high-molecular-weight HDPE or LLDPE.
   Bill Hellmuth, senior product manager, says the new line can switch
between a 17-in. die diameter, for HMW-HDPE, and a 24- in. die diameter for
LLDPE. The unit is equipped with a three-layer die and two extruders: 80-
and 90-mm. The line has a 124-in. nip roll face and an output range of 1000
to 15,000 lb./hr., depending on film thickness.
   Brampton Engineering Inc., Brampton, ON, Canada, has launched its
``Dial-A-Gap'' die gap adjusting system. Bill Wybenga, president, explains
the system isn't an automatic gaging control; it adjusts the total gap
around the die's circumference.
   Wybenga says the system, which can be electronically or manually
operated, allows processors to increase or decrease the nominal film die
gap to suit the needs of the material and the output rate. The gap can be
adjusted in a range of 0.5 to 3 mm. He says that operating with a more
narrow die gap increases the tear resistance and dart impact properties of
the film.
   Alpha Marathon Mfg. Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada, has introduced a
spiral die with a ``flow-mixing channel'' to provide a consistent
temperature gradient at the spiral. This provides more exact film gaging,
with improved optical properties and better machine-direction film
orientation.
   An Alpha spokesman explains that each spiral is fed from two ports, and
each port feeds two spirals, which homogenizes the melt entering the
spirals with a thermal layering effect. The screw also incorporates a
special mixing tip.

High-end applications include insulation
   Most sources were guarded when asked to discuss new market areas for
HDPE film. However, indications are that emerging higher-end applications
will involve using the material as a conductive insulator or shield.
   These applications include conductive bags and over-wraps, in areas such
as printed circuit boards, video and electrical cables, and other
electronic products.
   Hellmuth of Battenfeld says his firm is involved in new market
applications, which call for the development of HDPE film lamination. HDPE
film is laminated to a light-gage PE foam, providing conductive insulation
and a protective covering for consumer products.
   Gunther Neumann, a sales representative with Kiefel Inc., Wrentham, MA,
says a well-established trend for new-equipment sales for HDPE film has
been the inclusion of coextrusion capability. He says feedback from
processors indicates they require the flexibility to pair the strength and
downgaging properties of HDPE with the clarity and puncture resistance of
LLDPE.
   Reifenhauser has done proprietary development work with HDPE/LDPE
coextrusions, to produce higher-clarity film. The opacity typically
associated with HDPE is a surface phenomenon. LDPE, as an outer layer to
HDPE, becomes a clarity enhancer.
   Many processors and end users are evaluating the coextrusion
combination of HDPE and metallocenes, sources say. Application trends point
to using a metallocene as a skin layer over HDPE film. This combination
takes advantage of HDPE's superior tensile strength, along with the tear
resistance and enhanced surface appearance of metallocenes.

New oscillating systems are among advances
   Macro Engineering & Technology Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada, in March
will begin testing a horizontal oscillating nip on a lab-scale line. A
benefit of the design is a lower head-room requirement in processing
plants, compared with a typical vertical oscillating nip system. It also
eliminates the need to stand film on its edge, which reduces sagging.
   Brendan Dorney, sales engineer, says this design is well suited for the
production of HDPE film. He explains that the horizontal skew bars direct
the film in a scissor-like manner through the 180 or 360 deg. of rotation.
The fixed horizontal bars, like those in a vertical process, use an air
cushion for lubrication.
   Recent innovations from Egan Davis-Standard, Somerville, NJ, are a
94-in. oscillating nip, and European-style surface winder. Rick L. Keller,
industry director of film systems, says the new oscillating nip, introduced
last year, helps reduce gage variations in process, allowing for a more
uniform gage distribution, which results in a flatter, more consistent film
roll geometry. The nip is electrically driven and oscillates 720 deg.
(+/-360).
   The Egan surface winder has been rolled out to meet the demands of U.S.
film processors, many of whom are showing a preference to automatic surface
winders rather than center or turret winders.
   Surface winders long have been considered the system of choice among
European blown film processors. Keller says the Egan winder can handle
rolls up to 50 in. in diameter, and enables processors to achieve a higher
degree of control in the film roll hardness.
   Kiefel's ``light'' mono extrusion line (Compex 60 SA.L), is described as
a lower-cost system for HDPE packaging films. The system includes a
stationary extruder with a standard 23 L/D screw length, an internal bubble
stabilizer with a new high-slip, wear-resistant plastic cone, and dual
irises for external bubble stabilization.

EUROPEAN PROCESSORS NEED SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

By:
JOACHIM ECKSTEIN

   In the processing industry, our philosophy is one where basic standards
and strategies influence our everyday business practices. I believe that in
the past, we concentrated too heavily on the operational side. Only when
confronted with change did we consider new strategies. The changes
confronting our industry were often politically motivated, such as taking
back used products, quota regulations, or collection systems, and were not
related to sensible economic practices. We plastics processors too often
only reacted rather than developed our own independent strategies. Thus,
for example, we were not able to promote politically and publicly supported
waste-to-energy recovery through incineration. Today, only a few European
countries favor this economic and ecologically sound method of waste
management.
   We are confronted in all European countries with varied environmental
regulations at varied costs. The highest fees are found in Germany, to
support the Dual System's (DSD) collection and processing activities.
Recycling a kilogram of plastic costs about $2, three times the value of
the collected material.
   Last year members of the EuPC (European Plastics Converters Association)
reoriented their philosophy and strategy toward the same goals proposed by
European politicians. The EuPC has taken the principles of ``sustainable
development,'' as put forth at the 1992 Rio Conference, as tenets. We see
the fulfillment of Sustainable Development as insuring sustainable
existence for the entire plastics industry. Therefore, when the principles
of European plastics processors coincide with those of European
politicians, future conflicts between political and business goals can be
avoided.

PROFIT NEEDED TO WITHSTAND HARDSHIPS
   European processors are mainly small to medium-sized businesses which
understand that entrepreneurial activities, including ecological aspects,
have be economically viable. All new or additional ecological burdens
placed on our industry have to be both bearable and profitable to insure
the processor's economic survival. So far, this has not been the case. If
we are required to use recycled materials, then these materials should be
sold at rates that correspond to their actual costs.
   There are a number of internal actions we as processors can take to
align ecological measures with our business principles. Resource and energy
reduction, investing in modern technology to ensure better productivity and
low exhaust emissions, as well as sensible use of recyclate are just a few
of the measures we can contribute.
   The products we produce have different life cycles of usefulness. The
higher the quality and better the designs we manufacture, the longer they
can be used - therefore increasing the attractiveness for the customer who
should be willing to pay a higher price.
   By reducing raw material use and building in the collection and
recycling costs at the production stage, we can make our contribution to
improving both the environment and the cost situation.
   Collection, sorting, and recycling of used plastics are today not
covered in the processor's cost calculation. They are usually paid by
municipalities. The goal of the Rio Conference was to transfer these costs
to the producer and seller. This is only possible when a realistic cost
structure allows for a pragmatic cost/sales price ratio to cover the
recycling process.
   The EuPC is not propagating any single form of recycling. Of course,
mechanical recycling, the sole technology which the processor can put into
practice, is only attractive if the costs of collection, separation, and
utilization are under or at the same level as virgin raw material. If the
costs of sorting and cleaning plastics waste make mechanical reprocessing
uneconomical, then other methods such as waste-to-energy recycling should
be considered.
   By orienting our philosophy on the principles of sustainable
development, we European plastic processors want to contribute our part in
keeping plastics, with its outstanding properties, a preferred material.
This should stimulate growth in our industry and create jobs.
   A growth rate of only 1%/yr. in the European plastics processing
industry equates to income of $214 million, which finances 6000 extra jobs.
We thus see sustainable development making a meaningful contribution to all
our social security.

SPI SAYS IT WILL REVIEW PROPOSED RAIL MERGER

   Plans by rail line Union Pacific Corp. to acquire rival Southern Pacific
Transportation Co. are under study by the Society of the Plastics Industry,
to determine how such a consolidation of rail service would affect U.S.
resin shipments.
   The merger would create the largest Class 1 railroad in U.S. history.
SPI says that if the deal goes through, 75 to 80% of all resin produced
between Houston, TX, and New Orleans, LA, would be shipped by one company.
This amounts to 39 billion lb. - or 72% - of U.S. resin production.
   SPI is concerned about shipping rates. Transportation is 20% of resin
cost - the second-most expensive cost after raw materials. The group has
until March 29 to file an objection with regulators.
   Union Pacific, which filed notice of the merger Nov. 30 and seeks
approval by August, doesn't believe it will lead to higher prices. ``Lower
transport prices will result over the long run,'' says regional marketing
director Edward Trandahl. He notes 40 plastics shippers in support of the
merger.
   One supplier in favor is Andrew Smith, CEO of polyolefins producer
Rexene Corp. ``We believe the merger will provide more efficient
transportation service.''
   One statistic to emerge from SPI's review is the impact of plastics on
Texas and Louisiana. The industry employs 88,000 in those states, and pumps
$21 billion into their economies annually.

SABIC ADDS PET AND LDPE

   Addition of these resins by Saudi Basic Industries Corp. will make the
company, known by its acronym Sabic, one of the world's most broadly based
resin suppliers by 1996-97. Sabic already produces high-density
polyethylene, linear low-density PE, polypropylene, polystyrene, and
suspension grades of polyvinyl chloride.
   A 310-million-lb./yr. polyethylene terephthalate facility, including
capacity for bottle grades, was due on line late last year. A
770-million-lb./yr. plant for purified terephthalic acid monomer, a PET
precursor, is scheduled for startup in 1997, which would make Sabic
self-sufficient in PET feedstocks (it already makes ethylene glycol).
   The addition of conventional (high-pressure) low-density polyethylene
capacity is due on line in 1997. A 440-million-lb./yr. facility will make
heavy-duty bag, shrink wrap, and other film- and molding-grade resins.
Abdullah Nojaidi, Sabic's president, says that local users in the Middle
East now want their suppliers to provide them with LDPE to complement LLDPE
in blending and other roles.
   While LDPE has been losing share to LLDPE and HDPE for such applications
as films in various regions, it continues to find use in many markets for
the process efficiencies it provides as a blending resin with LLDPE. There
are also many process machines that are configured to run low-density PE,
which are not likely to be replaced or upgraded soon to take LLDPE.
   Sabic is also entering PVC emulsion (paste) supply, with a
50-million-lb./yr. unit just brought onstream. Support facilities to make
di-octyl phthalate plasticizers (using a technology to be licensed from
Japan's Mitsubishi), as well as DOP feedstocks, are also under
construction.

PC SHORTAGE MAY PROMOTE RESIN ALTERNATIVES

   Supply shortfalls, long lead times, and rising price continue to plague
polycarbonate. Several suppliers of PC (and competing clear/tough resins)
say lead times for delivering PC in North America, Europe, and Asia stood
at 8 to 16 weeks in late December. In October, a fourth price hike in six
months went into effect, bringing prices for blow molding grades to US$1.80
to $1.90/lb. for volume buys, a rise of at least $0.30/lb. since
first-quarter 1995. Many accounts are on allocation. (See related article,
p. 67.)
   Users are scrambling to cope. In some markets, where compromise on
clarity is feasible, a shift to lower-cost clear/tough styrenics is
occurring. Blending of PC and other polymers in opaque markets is
increasing, too. Bayer, for example, reports a shift in some markets to
alternative materials in its slate like ABS/PET alloys. The result is that
clear styrenics, like Phillips 66's butadiene-modified grades and Novacor's
acrylic-modified resins, are sold out, with inquiries in medical and other
roles flooding in.
   Indeed, some say a permanent change may be underway in select markets,
as end-users learn to adapt to alternatives that sell for under $1/lb. ``PC
shortfalls create a new mind-set - and a window for replacement,'' states
Steve Shelby, K-Resin commercial manager at Phillips 66, Houston, TX.
Another approach is to send out metallized PC scrap (e.g., from compact
disks), which is usually landfilled, for cleanup by recyclers and
subsequent reuse.
   ``PC today is simply precious,'' a supplier explains. Consultants peg
current PC capacity utilization rates at near 100%. And demand is viewed as
continuing to outrun announced capacity increases through 1996-97,
according to Bill Kuhlke, Kuhlke Assoc., Houston, TX. PC shortfalls and
high costs could persist until 1998-99, observers say.

LOSS OF GM WORK MAY FORCE SALE AT GENCORP

   GM's switch from sheet molding compound to steel for body panels on the
U-van platform has prompted GenCorp, the supplier of body panels, to
consider selling its Reinforced Plastics Div. Preliminary sale talks are
being held with Cambridge Industries Inc., Madison Heights, MI.
   GenCorp produced lift gates, doors, side panels, and other components
for the all-plastics-exterior U-van in Shelbyville, IN, since 1989.
Production of U-van components will end at mid-year. Parts are also made
there for GM's Camaro, Firebird, and Corvette, Chrysler's Jeep, and Ford's
Ranger.
   Cambridge is a diverse automotive supplier that maintains 11 plants in
the U.S. It produces interior trim, exterior panels, and structural
components.
   Observers say GM switched to steel for economy. The automaker is
redesigning the van for 1997 and anticipates volumes of 300,000 to 400,000,
a production level that is more cost-effective for steel. In 1995, volumes
reached 120,000 for the U-van, which consists of the Lumina APV,
Silhouette, and TranSport models. Only 100,000 units are planned for 1996.

PVC WINS 2, LOSES 1 IN LATEST GO-AROUND

   Proponents of polyvinyl chloride gained ground in two high-profile
regulatory showdowns.
   In Berlin, the city legislature voted down restrictions on vinyl use in
municipal construction, reversing a position that it took five years
earlier. Thus, in Germany's future capital, PVC resumes a familiar role as
a building material in windows, shutters, roof beams, and pipe.
   In Canada, Toronto officials urged legislators to reject an
activist-proposed ban on PVC pipe. Testimony by the industry is credited
with thwarting a citywide ban.
   A setback was encountered in Sweden, where Greenpeace claims victory in
a campaign to have Parliament approve the ``speedy'' phaseout of most PVC
products.

TAIWANESE PRESS MAKER IS AWARDED CE MARK

   Fu Chun Shin Machinery Manufacture Co., in Tainan, says that its 60- to
420-ton injection molding machines now carry the CE mark, a European
quality standard (Dec 95 MP, 23). U.K.-based body Amtri Veritas presented
the company with the certificate.
   According to Pao-Hiun Wang, president of FCS, the company is the first
Taiwanese injection machinery supplier to gain the CE mark. FCS spent a
year upgrading machinery with the assistance of its agent, Excel UK, for
certification.
   The CE mark is a prerequisite for machinery suppliers selling in Europe.
FCS says clients worldwide are requesting machines with the mark, which is
becoming an international safety standard.

GROWTH PROJECTED FOR BLOW MOLDED BULK CONTAINERS IN U.S. AND EUROPE

By:
Michael C. Gabriele

   The U.S. and Europe are emerging as high-growth markets for the
production and sale of blow molded intermediate bulk containers. Demand for
the specialized industrial containers is steaming along at an annual growth
rate of at least 15%, a trend expected to continue over the next five
years. However, the wider use of blow molded IBCs is coming at the expense
of rotationally molded containers.
   IBCs represent a class of large-volume (275 or 330 gal., and 1000 or
1250 liter) industrial containers, with a blow molded tank enclosed and
supported by a tubular steel or welded wire mesh structure.
   A critical boost to the growth of blow molded IBCs occurred in late
1994, when the United Nations passed an international commerce regulation
(HM-181E), which stated blow molded IBCs containing hazardous materials
could be reused. Prior to this ruling, only rotationally molded tanks could
be recycled for the shipment of hazardous materials. The chemical industry
and food processors represent the two major end-use markets for IBCs.

Four major processors are located in U.S.
   Tom Barrett, president of Scheutz Container Systems Inc., North Branch,
NJ - one of four major U.S. producers of blow molded IBCs - notes the
growth of blow molded IBCs is being pulled by solid demand from end users.
``End users see the advantages in more efficient, cost-effective material
handling, and safer overall storage of materials using IBCs, compared with
55-gal. drums,'' Barrett states.
   Hoover Material Handling Group Inc., with three production facilities
(Mount Vernon, OH; Anniston, AL; and Beatrice, NE) is the largest U.S.
producer of blow molded IBCs. John R. Redmond, president, estimates that
his company currently produces nearly half of all blow molded IBCs in the
U.S.
   Other U.S. processors include Sonoco Product Co., Lavonia, GA, and
Scheutz (production installations in North Branch; Atlanta; and
Perrysburg, OH). Sonoco produces blow molded IBCs under a license
technology agreement with Sotralentz, a machinery builder and system
integrator based in Drulingen, France.
   A fourth company, Van Leer Containers Inc., based in Alsip, IL, is
slated to begin production at a plant in Lawrenceville, GA, during the
first half of this year. The firm is a unit of Van Leer Nederland BV,
Amstelveen, the Netherlands.
   Blow molding equipment suppliers for the production of IBCs include
Krupp Kautex Maschinenbau GmbH, Bonn, Germany; the Plastics Machinery Div.
of Cincinnati Milacron, Batavia, OH; Battenfeld Blowmolding Machines Inc.,
Boonton, NJ; Bekum America Corp., Williamston, MI; Ube Industries Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan; and Uniloy Srl, Calenzano, Italy.
Two German equipment builders - Rikutec GmbH, based in Altenkirchen, and
Mauser-Werke GmbH, located in Bruhl - produce their own line of blow
molding machines for commercial sale, as well as process IBCs.
   Hoover operates two Krupp Kautex machines - one in Mt. Vernon and one in
Anniston. Last April, Hoover went on line with a new Bekum unit in Mt.
Vernon.
   Michael D. Hodges, Sonoco market manager, plastics, says his company
utilizes two Krupp Kautex machines at its Lavonia site.
   Sources say there are as many as 15 processors in Europe producing blow
molded IBCs, with the companies concentrated mainly in Germany, France, and
the Netherlands. Scheutz Werke GmbH, Selters, Germany, (the parent firm to
Scheutz Container), and Van Leer are identified as the largest European
producers of blow molded IBCs.
   It's estimated that between 900,000 and 1.1 million blow molded IBCs
were produced and sold in Europe in 1995, according to industry sources. By
contrast, the U.S. market reached just over 400,000 units last year. Both
totals represent a growth rate of 15% compared with the previous year, a
level of average annual increase anticipated to continue for this business
segment through the year 2000, sources say.
   Bob Zendel, Sonoco general manager, says IBCs are developing as a
preferred mode of material transportation, replacing the venerable 55-gal.
drum. Compared with the drums, IBCs are described as being more efficient
containers, in terms of shipping space utilization, handling and storage,
enclosure cleaning and reuse, and material dispensing, he says.

Technical innovations for blow molded IBCs
   The leading-edge technological trend for blow molded IBCs involves the
use of coextrusion techniques. Multilayer tanks can incorporate a
combination of resin systems, or can make use of regrind material,
depending on the application.
   Sonoco and Van Leer this year will initiate production of coextruded
IBCs in the U.S. Sonoco will employ its existing Krupp equipment, while Van
Leer will use a Rikutec machine. Hoover, with its Bekum unit, also will
have coextrusion capability.
   In another development, Hoover recently unveiled its ``Tufftote'' line
of IBCs, which combines an inner HDPE blow molded vessel with a two-part
outer RIM shell. The RIM material is a thermoset olefin (dicyclopentadiene
or DCPD) known as Telene, supplied by BFGoodrich Co., Cleveland, OH. The
result is a freestanding plastics IBC with no metal support frame, which
can be stacked up to three units high.
   Hoover officials say Tufftote IBCs have a 60% lower tare weight
compared with standard metal-caged containers, and eliminate the corrosion
problems commonly associated with metal frames when transporting various
hazardous liquid chemicals.

PEEK GETS PUMPED

By:
Joseph A. Grande

   Metal is slowly taking a back seat when it comes to low-wear and
low-friction applications in the oil refinery and petrochemical industries.
Polyether-etherketone (PEEK) is increasingly being used in stationary and
rotating wear components in centrifugal pumps which are used in oil
refineries, petrochemical plants, and pipeline installations.
   A good example is a new large-scale refinery in Thailand. The builder,
Caltex Corp., Dallas, TX, specified PEEK for the case rings in all the
refinery's process pumps. It may be the first time that a new pump
construction has been specified with non-metallic wear rings, according to
PEEK compounder and processor EGC Corp., Houston, TX.
   In contrast to 410 stainless steel, bronze, or cast iron, PEEK is
non-galling and non-seizing when in contact with other metal-mating
surfaces. The formulation, called Xytrex 451, is a 30% chopped carbon fiber
resin with tensile strength of 17,000 p.s.i. and continuous use temperature
of 350 to 400F. The material has a coefficient of friction that is six
times better than stainless steel, according to the supplier. The
compression-molded rings are 6-in. x 5.5 in. x 1-in.

MANIFOLD MIXING UNIT PUTS A SKIN LAYER ON MOLDINGS

By:
Peter Mapleston

   A small mixing unit that fits between nozzle and mold in injection and
blow molding machines can be used to produce sandwich moldings in which
colorants and other surface-active additives are present only in the skin
layer of the molding. The system was introduced at K'95, and according to
its developers has aroused considerable interest, not only among potential
customers, but also suppliers of additives as well as thermoplastics.
   The Addmix system works with any type of additive in liquid form. One
primary application is colors, but Addmix says the unit is equally
appropriate for such additives as release agents, and even laser-sensitive
additives used in moldings that are subsequently printed by lasers (Aug 95
MP, 28).
   As of January, the London-based company will supply off-the-shelf
manifolds that attach to the back of each mold. The additive is mixed into
the polymer melt between the end of the injection barrel and the mold. By
selective addition of the additive into the first part of the shot - the
part which becomes the skin layer of the molding - processors can cut down
on their additives consumption by as much as 80%, depending on the geometry
of the part. Users can adjust the volume of melt into which the additive is
mixed, over a limited range.
   Use of the manifold does not affect production cycle times. Although no
details are available on the design and the means of mixing the additive
into the melt, company director Simcha Kilim describes the manifold as a
``form of hot-runner manifold.'' He says it does contain a non-rotating
moving part connected to the injection head. ``It does not affect the
regular behavior of the machine,'' he says. Additive is metered to the
manifold using a simple peristaltic pump that delivers constant pressure.

System helps molders save money, material
   Kilim says that although it might appear at first that additive
suppliers would hesitate to embrace a technology that will reduce their
sales, companies supplying additives with low degradation temperatures are
interested because the Addmix manifold submits the additives to little
thermal and shear stress.
   The Addmix system can be used in various ways. The company's main
interest is in skin molding, and around the middle of next year it will
introduce a version for multiple-cavity molds that enables selective
coloring (diagram). In this system, melt is split into two streams, and
each stream can be mixed with a different color.
   A manifold suitable for linking to a mold with a cavity around 200 cu.
cm. costs around $8500 (5000). Addmix says that money can be recouped in a
few months. It cites savings possible with a typical polymer with a base
cost of $0.865/lb.
   A yellow compound containing 1.5% additive priced at $10.468/lb. costs
$1.009/lb. In production of a part with a 3-mm. wall thickness, the Addmix
system can be used to give a skin layer of 0.5 mm. (1 mm. total). If the
color in the skin layer is added at 2% for security, the total cost for
material in a part weighing 1 lb. is $0.927, giving a saving of $0.08/lb.
of processed material. The savings are even more stark when more exotic
colors, some of which cost over $70/lb., are used.

MD&M-WEST CONFERENCE TO ADDRESS DESIGN REGULATION

By:
Merle R. Snyder

   Regulatory issues, technology advances, and global business
opportunities will be the focus of attention as participants from the U.S.
and about 30 other countries gather for the 12th annual Medical Design &
Manufacturing (MD&M) West conference and exhibition, Feb. 6 to 8, at the
Convention Center in Anaheim, CA. About 800 exhibitors are expected to
occupy 112,000 sq. ft. of space.
   An early session, Feb. 5, conducted by representatives of the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), is billed: ``GMP (good manufacturing
practices) Design Controls and the New 510(k) Environment - a Regulatory
Update.'' Visitors may also sign up for 15 minutes of free consultation
with industry and regulatory agency experts in the ``Meet the Experts''
forum.
   The new GMP rule has been designed for compatibility with the
quality-systems philosophy of the International Standards Organization
(ISO) 9000 series of international standards. Manufacturers that properly
implement design controls can also reduce their product liability exposure
and minimize product development costs. The session will include discussion
of the new 510(k) guidelines' impact on device marketing.
   Specific topics to be addressed include implementation timing for
specific design controls; component, labeling, and packaging design
controls; design input, verification, and output; biocompatibility
considerations; and proper preparation of a 510(k).
   Also on Feb. 5, is a tour of the R&D and clean-room assembly operations
of Gish Biomedical, Irvine, CA. Gish manufactures medical devices used in
cardiovascular and orthopedic surgery, orthopedic and thoracic autologous
blood recovery and reuse systems, and vascular access products for extended
home-care infusion therapies. Tour participants will have the opportunity
to meet with researchers, product designers, manufacturing engineers, and
corporate management in the course of the tour of the 150,000-sq.-ft.
production facility.
   Speakers in a Feb. 6 session on clinical trials will discuss the use
of human subjects to determine a product's efficacy and marketability,
while focusing on such issues as investigational device exemptions (IDEs),
FDA regulations, effective clinical trial design, difficulties in
conducting trials, and alternative techniques for overcoming problems.
   In a partnership that is now entering its third year, the Medical
Plastics Div. of the Society of Plastics Engineers (SPE) is presenting a
Regional Technical Conference (Retec) in an all-day session Feb. 7,
concurrent with the MD&M West event. Hosted by Exxon Chemical's Robert
Portnoy, and chaired by Udayan Patel of Advanced Cardiovascular Systems,
the session is billed ``Application of Plastics to Medical Devices:
Problems and Solutions.''

Molders, designers seek global opportunities
   International considerations loom ever larger in the medical device
business. International standards-setting groups are creating a wide range
of global standards regarding clean-room and aseptic processing and
packaging. A session on Feb. 8, instructed by Anne Marie Dixon, managing
partner of a clean room consulting firm, will discuss the work of ISO's
Technical Committee 198.
   Also on Feb. 8, speakers will address opportunities in Japan, greater
Asia, Taiwan, Europe, and Latin America in a session entitled ``Global
Expansion: International Opportunities for Medical Device Manufacturing
Companies.''
The market for medical devices and supplies in China is expected to surpass
$1 billion this year. The country is therefore the focus of a session to
include presentations by officials of the Ministry of Health, People's
Republic of China, including: an ``Overview of the Chinese Health-Care
System''; ``Hospital and Clinical Needs for Medical Devices''; and
``Reimbursement Policies and Cost Containment.''
   U.S.-China government initiatives will be discussed by Paul E. Barry,
international trade specialist, Office of Microelectronics, Medical
Equipment, and Instrumentation, International Trade Administration, at the
U.S. Dept. of Commerce.
   MD&M West is sponsored by Medical Device & Diagnostic Industry magazine,
published by Canon Communications Inc. For information, call (310)

ORGANIC PEROXIDES FACE STIFF TECHNOLOGICAL COMPETITORS

By:
Gordon Graff

   New technologies for producing and modifying polymers are posing a
formidable challenge to organic peroxides as the additives of choice in a
number of traditional high-volume areas.
   According to industry observers, peroxides are still secure in such
current applications as initiators for vinyl polymerization, curing agents
for thermoset resins, and crosslinking agents for elastomers and PE. But
they say that fast-rising competitors like metallocene catalyst technology
and electron beam processing could eventually edge out peroxides in their
present roles as rheology modifiers for PP and as initiators for production
of LDPE.
   In the modification of PP, ``metallocenes definitely have an advantage
over peroxides,'' says consultant John Murphy of The Catalyst Group, Spring
House, PA. Right now, peroxides are often used to degrade PP in a
controlled fashion, after it emerges from the reactor. This
``vis-breaking'' produces a polymer with a relatively narrow molecular
weight (MW) distribution, a feature that improves its melt flow properties
during processing. But metallocene catalysts have the ability to produce PP
right out of the reactor with the requisite narrow MW distribution. Such
polymers in principle should need no post-reactor peroxide treatment.
   There is little uncertainty in the minds of metallocene polymer
producers. Malcolm Kaus, Exxpol venture manager at Exxon Chemical, Houston,
TX, declares flatly that Exxon's recently commercialized metallocene PP
technology ``will greatly diminish, if not eliminate, peroxide use'' in the
treatment of PP. ``Of course this is only a projection,'' he adds, ``and
I'm not sure in what time frame this will be realized.''
   Besides Exxon, other developers of metallocene-based PP include Hoechst
AG, Frankfurt, Germany; BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany; and Japan's Mitsui
Toatsu, Tokyo.

Metallocene claims concern peroxide makers
   Peroxide producers are taking the metallocene competition seriously.
``We're definitely concerned about claims'' that metallocenes will displace
peroxides, says R. Gerald Gimbarski, business manager for organic peroxides
at Elf Atochem, Philadelphia, PA. ``I agree that metallocenes could be a
threat,'' adds Ronald Pastorino, market manager for organic peroxides at
Witco Corp., Greenwich, CT, although he says that any challenge is not
likely to materialize for ``several years.''
   Electron beam (E-beam) processing is also presenting a frontal challenge
to peroxides. E-beam processors claim that their systems have advantages
over peroxides in such applications as crosslinking rotationally molded PE
storage tanks and curing the resin in PE water tubing. For example, Karen
Butler, marketing director at E-Beam Services, Cranbury, NJ, points out
that peroxides, which are temperature-sensitive, are not compatible with
high shear rates or the process temperatures required for high line speeds
and thin-walled or intricately shaped products, whereas E-beam curing can
be used in these applications. She adds that E-beam allows more precise
control of crosslinking density than peroxides or other chemical curing
agents.
   One drawback of E-beam systems is that fabricators, who seldom wish to
invest in an E-beam facility on their premises, typically have to ship
their uncured objects to a distant processor. On the other hand, the extra
transportation costs are reduced by the savings from eliminating peroxides
in the formulation.
   Despite stiff competition from other technologies, peroxide makers are
continuing to innovate. At Elf Atochem, Gimbarski points to two recent
introductions under its Lupersol line of organic peroxides. These products,
grades 610-M50 and 688-M50, are hexylene glycol peroxyesters that serve as
low-temperature, fast front-end initiators in the production of polyvinyl
chloride. They are intended to speed up polymerization cycle times.
   The 610-M50 grade is also the first new peroxide additive approved in
the U.S. in 12 years not required by the Environmental Protection Agency to
carry a warning label of carcinogenic hazards. Elf avoided the label by
submitting voluminous safety testing data to EPA.

LIQUID COLORANTS ARE FREE OF OLD DRAWBACKS, GAIN IN POPULARITY

By:
Gordon Graff

   Liquid colorants, which were once confined to a small niche in the
injection molding business, are now competing head-on with traditional
color concentrates and other solid systems in high-volume extrusion and
extrusion blow molding markets. Behind this trend are technical advances
over the past five years that have made liquid colorants more reliable and
economical for many applications than pellet concentrates and other solid
colorants.
   In particular, improved carrier vehicles have made liquid systems
compatible with just about all thermoplastic resins, and a new generation
of highly accurate liquid dispensing pumps now offers consistent color
quality in fabricated products. The high concentrations of pigment in the
latest liquid systems also enhances their economic appeal for processors.
   The liquid colorants industry received a big boost earlier this year
when Rubbermaid Inc., Wooster, OH, one of the country's largest plastics
processors, decided to switch from solid colorants to liquid systems in
many of its plastics fabricating operations. Details of the switch are
sketchy, and Rubbermaid declines to comment on it. But according to one
industry observer, the move will be ``very influential'' in convincing
smaller processors to adopt liquid systems.

Business is booming for colorant pump suppliers
   While there are few estimates of the size of the liquid colorants
market, suppliers of both the colorants and the dispensing pumps often sold
with them report that business is booming. ``Sales of liquid colorant pumps
have more than doubled for us this year,'' says B. Patrick Smith, vice
president for marketing and sales at Maguire Products Inc., Media, PA, one
of the leading suppliers of dispensing equipment for liquid systems. And
Michael R. Shaughnessy, president of ColorMatrix Corp., Cleveland, OH, a
supplier of liquid colorants, estimates that such products are growing
``significantly faster'' in the U.S. than the plastics colorants business
as a whole.
   Despite their inroads into extrusion applications, liquid systems are
still concentrated heavily in injection molded products. According to one
industry observer, liquid colorants now account for 20 to 25% of the
colorants used for injection molded products in North America.
   By most accounts, use of liquid colorants is far more widespread in
North America than Europe. In explaining this disparity, industry sources
cite the fact that many European pigment manufacturers also make color
concentrates, which have well-entrenched markets. Elsewhere, pigment makers
are more independent and thus freer to experiment with new formulations.
Nonetheless, liquid systems are catching on in Europe. In fact, new
business there has been so brisk that ColorMatrix recently opened a
manufacturing plant near Liverpool, England, to address the market.
Meanwhile, interest in liquid colorants is said to be particularly strong
in Latin America.
   Liquid colorants have come a long way from their first appearance in the
late 1970s, when incompatibility between their liquid carrier vehicles and
many thermoplastics caused slippage of extruder screws. Many formulations
were also slow to disperse in melted resins, and liquid dispensing
equipment was often inaccurate or costly.
   Today's liquid carriers - their compositions are well-guarded trade
secrets - are compatible with most polyolefin, styrenic, and engineering
resins; screw slippage is largely a thing of the past. Better milling
procedures are producing very fine pigment particles that make liquid
colorants easier to disperse than competing dry powdered colorants and even
the liquid colorants of just a few years ago.

Dispensing units are more accurate, less expensive
   Perhaps the most significant factor responsible for the growing
popularity of liquid colorants is the accurate and inexpensive dispensing
pumps that have recently come to the fore. These pumps are portable and
generally cost between $1000 and $2500. Liquid colorants are often
formulated for particular dispensing machines. In fact, such liquid
colorant suppliers as Ferro Corp., Edison, NJ, and Morton International,
Chicago Heights, IL, also offer their customers dispensing machinery.
   Although they differ in details, most current liquid color dispensing
units feature a peristaltic pump, in which liquid is released by periodic
compression and release of a flexible pumping tube by a series of rollers.
The rollers are driven by a variable-speed, microprocessor-controlled
motor. Precise metering is achieved by automatic counting of each rotation
of the motor, which is set to deliver a known amount of liquid per
rotation. The liquid colorant always remains inside the feed tube and never
comes into contact with the rollers or any other part of the pumping
mechanism. As a result, color changeovers can be rapid.
   The colorant feed tube usually enters injection or extrusion machines in
one of two locations: immediately below the hopper at the feed throat, or
into a groove machined into the base of the barrel. Both configurations
promote rapid mixing of colorant and resin in the barrel and an even
distribution of color in extruded or molded articles.
   While liquid colorants usually cost more on a unit basis than powders or
pellet concentrates, they are so concentrated (typically 75% pigment
loadings) that they are often more economical to use than competing
products.
   Despite the favorable economics, liquid colorants have been slow to
penetrate some applications. Blown film is one such area, because liquid
systems are less efficient than the concentrates in achieving required
levels of opacity in very thin films.
   Meanwhile, suppliers of liquid colorants are unveiling grades for
special applications. For example, Riverdale Color Manufacturing, Brooklyn,
NY, is developing liquid colorants for use with ABS resins.
   Overall, growth of liquid colorants during the next year is expected to
remain strong. Among the reasons, notes Riverdale Color president Charles
Irish, are recent price hikes for polyethylene, polypropylene, and other
carrier resins used in pellet concentrates. Because of the resulting run-up
in concentrate prices, he says, ``more processors may entertain switching
to liquids.''

AUG 95 MP, 15

   An article about machinery supplier Starlinger & Co. indicated that
three years ago it bought, then sold, fellow Austrian company Maplan
International (Aug 95 MP, 15). In fact, although Starlinger bought the
entire Maplan International business, encompassing twin- and single-screw
extruders and rubber processing equipment, it only subsequently sold the
twin-screw business (to Theysohn Extrusionstechnik, also of Austria). It
retains the remaining businesses. Starlinger has never had any holding in
American Maplan, which was separate from Maplan Int. and which was recently
acquired by the Battenfeld Group.

PLASMA POLYMERIZATION USED FOR SCRATCH-RESISTANT COATINGS

By:
Robert Colvin

   Researchers at Germany's Institute for Plastics Processing (IKV),
Aachen, have come up with an innovative process to coat injection molded
polycarbonate and polymethyl methacrylate optical parts to obtain high
scratch resistance. This high-density process - a vacuum-coating method
which produces a glass-like surface - is performed at relatively low
temperatures in a microwave bath. IKV scientists are predicting the
technique can eventually be used to economically coat any size surface.
   Its specific advantage is that properties of the polymer layers
deposited on the plastic can be modified through selective process control
and aligned to a range of requirements such as crosslinking and the ability
to withstand chemical and mechanical stresses. This coating is free of
micropores, has an amorphous layer structure, and offers good adhesion,
even to nonpolar surfaces.
   Previously used methods for applying coatings include painting them on
the lens surface, which carries the drawback of dust contamination and ion
plating, and allows only low scratch resistance over small areas and
entails long process times. Plasma-aided evaporation is another option.
Here, clean-room conditions are needed, as well as resources to deal with
solvent-laden air.
   Plasma polymerization's adhesive qualities are obtained through a form
of process control which involves the formation of coupling agent layers
during coating. These layers are aligned to the substrate being used. By
varying the process parameters, it is possible for the hardness of the
interface layer to be further tailored.
   To obtain adequate scratch resistance as determined by the sand drop
test (DIN 52348-1) on PC, a coating of 6 micron is needed. The coating rate
is up to 2 micron/min., 50 times higher than plasma-aided evaporation
systems, says IVK's Harald Zell.
   IKV engineers have developed a plant concept for the production of
large-area coatings. So far they have been able to apply plasma
homogeneously over a width of 500 mm. at a deposition rate of 0.2
micron/min.
   Apart from transparent, scratch-resistant coatings, plasma
polymerization may find other applications. Since the surface tension of
the coatings can be selectively varied, hydrophobic layers can be employed
as anti-stick coatings. With hydrophilic coatings, good anti-misting
properties can be obtained, since droplets of water on the substrate
spontaneously form a transparent film which doesn't scatter light. IKV
researchers say anti-permeation coatings for PE fuel tanks are also on the
horizon.

CONNECTOR MARKETS FACE DECADE OF HIGH RISKS AND BIG REWARDS

By:
Robert D. Leaversuch

   At first glance, today's fast-emerging information age looks like a
bonanza for some 500 companies worldwide that mold electronic connectors,
and for their materials and equipment suppliers. Indeed, overall resin use
should continue to grow at about 10%/yr. Yet the breakneck speed of
technological change in the varied end-markets that use connectors is
disconcerting.
   In fact, the connector industry faces a tough, risky decade ahead as it
copes with expanding yet swift-changing demands by multinational giants who
manufacture computer, business machine, wireless, cellular phone,
automotive, and other electronic systems, and which in turn depend on
connectors.
   Ongoing evolution in electronics makes it difficult to understand or
predict market needs, according to a study to be issued in early 1996 by
Fleck Research, Santa Ana, CA. The consultant is estimating global unit and
polymer use rates for some 700 distinct connector segments through 2005.
   A central dilemma is that the exploding demand for the number of
connector units worldwide coincides with miniaturization and integration of
the devices. Fewer, smaller connectors eventually can mean less resin use
for each application. Also, miniaturization intensifies the performance
requirements for both the connectors and resins selected to make them.
   Miniaturization of connectors is driving designers to more
lightweighting and precision, higher flame-retardancy ratings, and higher
operating temperatures as compared to the past, says Ken Fleck, coordinator
of the study. This opens new opportunities for resins like liquid crystal
polymer.

Connectors claim 600 million lb. of resin
   World connector markets attract captive and custom producers that
include major global technology powerhouses (table). In 1995, world
thermoplastics use in connectors hit 600 million lb., according to the
Fleck report. This includes about a 10 to 15% fraction of thermosets
(mainly phenolic).
   Thermoplastics in connectors tend to be high-performance, high-value
materials. Most cost about $1.60 to $2.27/lb.; a fifth cost $2.27 to
$9.10/lb.
   Polyamides and thermoplastic polyesters are the most widely used
polymers, followed by polyphenylene sulfide, PC, and liquid crystal
polymers.
   The U.S. is the largest regional market, with a global share of 35%, or
210 million lb. Its largest end-use markets are data communication, phone,
wireless, computer, and automotive systems.
   Western Europe and Japan each have roughly 25% of the world market for
connectors, with a dozen Pacific Rim nations supplying another 10%. Shifts
in automobile production (e.g., to the Far East, Eastern Europe, and Latin
America) in recent years have made automotive connectors more widely used
there. They come in tiers used in the engine (e.g., anti-lock brakes) and
passenger compartment (seat belts), having quite different requirements.
   Global demand for connector units is exploding. The report estimates 50%
more connector units will be sold in the U.S. in the next five years, from
20 billion to 30 billion units. But profiting from this expansion may be
less than easy for molders and materials suppliers.

Challenges come with changing electronics
   The composition of connector markets is changing in lockstep with
changes in electronic products. For instance, 65% of the computers sold in
1995 in North America were desktop models, and 9% were workstation models.
But this 74% segment of computers consumed 90% of connector units and 96%
of resin.
   A decade from now, the market is expected to shift to notebook and
handheld computers, which tend to use fewer, smaller connector units. In
1995, these categories made up 25% of computers, but used only 4% of
resin.
   Another escalating design requirement is increases in the density of
pins (i.e., number per sq. in.), and increases in the pitch of pins and
connectors. Additionally, smaller connector designs generally involve lower
shrinkage rates, thinner walls, and more precise processing.
   The types of polymers used in connectors is in flux as a result of these
pressures. For example, Woo Young, Pyungtaek, South Korea, recently
switched a 300-pin connector for telephone exchanges to a nylon 46 from DSM
Engineering Plastics, Sittard, The Netherlands. The Stanyl material
replaces cross-linked PPS, and is said to offer problem-free insertion,
high pin-retention, and soldering resistance to 260C.
   At the same time, new versions of PPS, including linear grades made by
Hoechst AG, Frankfurt, Germany, are replacing polyesters in some roles.
A strong shift from thermosets to thermoplastics is also underway, Fleck
reports.

                   connectors face a major

POLYPROPYLENE SHOWS ITS METTLE IN TEXTILE DYE-TUBE DESIGN

By:
Robert D. Leaversuch

   Compressible dye-tube moldings illustrate how designers can use plastics
to enhance manufacturability, consolidate parts, and reduce material waste.
The cylindrical, lattice-walled, spring-like devices, injection molded in
PP by Technimark Inc., Randleman, NC, compress 40% when under high-speed
load, yet resist crushing.
   The necessary balance of flexibility and strength, along with desired
thermal and chemical resistance, are provided by PP resins supplied by
Epsilon Products, Marcus Hook, PA.
   PP dye tubes are rapidly replacing stainless steel versions in the U.S.
for high-speed winding of polyester and PP yarns through 270 degress F. dye
baths. The devices incorporate molded-in fins that allow the yarn to be fed
directly from the item to the subsequent weaving or knitting steps in
textile-making. Moreover, a three-fold transfer of yarn to separate metal
and paper tubing pickup devices (a process called ``backwinding'') is
bypassed. These previously needed steps had added to labor costs, generated
considerable tubing waste, and degraded fiber quality.
   The spring-like behavior of the PP devices in effect increases the
effective capacity of costly dye baths by 40%, and reduces chemicals and
water use. In 1995, Technimark expected to mold 30 million of the
lightweight (0.25 lb.) parts for the U.S. market, where a rapid transition
to PP is underway.
   Mike Pembroke, Epsilon's sales director, asserts that the application
``extends the envelope of PP design capabilities.'' Technology and know-how
for processing the complex, high-tolerance part is licensed by Joseph
Zimmerman, Aachen, Germany.
   Technimark has adapted the tube design for the U.S. Two- and four-cavity
molds are used; cycle times are 10 to 14 sec. The processor has designed in
stop buttons to prevent overcompression of tubes. Machines used are 400-ton
Van Dorn HT units. The disposable dye tubes can be reused in PP
furniture.

EXPORTS AND LOW MONOMER COST KEEP SUPPLY AND PRICING STABLE

By:
Robert Colvin

   Subdued buying by processors and a quarter-by-quarter drop in the cost
of ethylene monomer helped to keep polyethylene prices last year from
rising to what many producers would have termed an acceptable rate. Bad
news for the producers, no doubt, but good news for processors, especially
after 1994, which saw some of the steepest price run-ups for PE in recent
years.
   Though manufacturers are banking on low customer inventories helping to
stimulate buying in the first quarter of this year, chances are that prices
will remain pretty much where they were at the end of 1995.
   In North America, for example, fourth-quarter polyethylene prices ranged
from 37 cents/lb. for blow molding grades of high-density PE, to 40
cents/lb. for low-density PE liner grades. These levels were down
substantially from second-quarter 1995, when the average price for blow
molding grades of HDPE topped out at 50 cents/lb. and liner-grade LDPE hit
48 cents/lb.
   Moreover, in North America, ethylene monomer prices began the year at 31
cents/lb. and finished 1995 at 21 cents/lb.

North American pricing affects global resin costs
   Not surprisingly then, North American LDPE prices are considered to be
very competitive vis-a-vis those of other exporting regions on the global
market. According to McGraw-Hill's Platt's Polymerscan, a pricing service
in London, offshore resin sources continue to exert an influence on global
pricing. In Western Europe, imports, though slowing, remain a factor in the
price structure of resin. Asian prices have weakened as a result of high
availability from a variety of sources, according to Platt's Hazel Marlow.
   Among the various PE types, consultants note that HDPE inventories
remain high and export sales show no signs of taking off. They attribute
this to direct competition in film applications with linear low-density PE,
which itself is hit by overcapacity.
   Change might be in the offing in 1996, however. Advances in HDPE film
process technologies and blown film extrusion lines, coupled with
price-driven gains in large-volume markets like T-shirt bags, bode well for
the resin's use in many areas, notably, Western Europe and North America
(see story, p. 44).
   Compounding the situation for PE producers is market agitation in
Europe. Investigators acting on European Commission orders swooped down
late last year on corporate offices of manufacturers Borealis, BASF, BP,
DSM, Dow, Shell, Petrofina, Hoechst, Solvay, and Polimeri Europa, over
allegations of possible illegal cartel operations in pricing. The
investigation, which is still underway, appears to have been prompted by
complaints from processors and buyers stemming from limited supplies early
last year, allegations of price fixing, and possible restrictive
competitive practices.

Formulation advances upgrade properties
   Prices and politics aside, polymer technology is sparking optimism with
regard to properties enhancements. DSM, Sittard, the Netherlands, has come
up with an injection molding grade of LLDPE, Stamylex, which offers high
purity and a narrow molecular weight distribution.
   London-based BP Chemicals and Germany's Hoechst, Frankfurt, have come
out with a range of grades (rated as PE 100) for high-pressure water, gas,
steam, and industrial pipes.
   Not to be outdone, both HDPE market leader Solvay, Brussels, Belgium,
and Borealis, Lyngby, Denmark, introduced at K'95 third-generation grades
for similar applications (rated PE 80 and PE 100).
   The high-pressure pipe grades are, for the most part, bimodal.
   Hoechst is also eyeing future applications that will take market share
from other materials with its HDPE. Key among them is the hoped for
switch-over by Germany's mineral water producers from glass to polyethylene
terephthalate bottles, and the resulting demand for new bottle crates as
well as substitution of aluminum caps by HDPE caps.
   Even machine manufacturers are getting into the act by upgrading
extrusion lines for HDPE. Increases in competitive materials' prices and
waste-management costs have allowed HDPE film to make important inroads
into the film market through its down-gaging properties. Reifenhauser,
Troisdorf, Germany, for example, is designing better certain of its lines
to fit the polymer's characteristics.
   New capacity coming on stream includes production for specialty grades.
One example is the new Borstar technology for manufacturing
enhanced-property bimodal PE, which went into commercial operation at the
end of last year in a 264-million-lb./yr. plant run by Borealis in Porvoo,
Finland.
   Quantum Chemical, Cincinnati, OH, has a new Unipol PE gas-phase
LLDPE/HDPE unit, with a capacity of 480 million lb./yr., set to start up at
the end of 1996 in La Porte, TX. At the same site, the company will
maintain its 85-million-lb./yr. LLDPE unit dedicated to making rotational
molding resins. By the end of June, it will also have restarted a
250-million-lb./yr. Unipol reactor at Morris, IL. Another Unipol LLDPE
reactor at the site will be debottlenecked to raise capacity by 100 million
lb./yr. to a total of 400 million lb./yr.
   In a final move, Quantum has plans to convert its dedicated LLDPE
reactor at Port Arthur, TX, to a dedicated HDPE unit using BP technology
offering a capacity of 300 million lb./yr. Work is slated for completion by
October.
   Other suppliers are also increasing capacity. Montell, Wilmington, DE,
has started up a 440-million-lb./yr. PE plant at Lake Charles, LA, using
its Spherilene process technology.
   Dow Plastics, Midland, MI, plans to debottleneck an LDPE plant in
Sarnia, ON, Canada, and an LLDPE train located in Fort Saskatchewan,
Canada.
   Polimeri Europa, the Enichem/Union Carbide joint venture, in Milan,
Italy, will build a 400-million-lb./yr. Unipol swing reactor for HDPE and
LLDPE in Brindisi, Italy.
   Meanwhile, several companies say plants are scheduled for construction
in Brazil, India, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and parts of Southeast Asia and
China.
   While few plans exist for deactivating plants, Dow Plastics recently
announced it is shuttering a slurry HDPE facility in Sarnia, ON, Canada,
with a nameplate capacity of 160 million lb./yr.
   Konrad Scheidl, former PE manager at Dow and now market analyst with
Maack Business Services, in Au, Switzerland, sees one affect of all this
new capacity on the market, especially that using swing technology to
produce either LLDPE or HDPE: loss of share by LDPE. These swing-capacity
resins are making rapid penetration in the film market because of HDPE's
downgaging qualities and alpha-olefin-comonomer LLDPE's improved tensile,
heat seal, and impact strength, and high miscibility. LLDPE is calculated
by Maack to overtake HDPE this year in capacity growth, and to surpass LDPE
in 1998.
   Peter Toohy, manager of plastics sales for Chevron Chemical, Houston,
TX, says he doesn't see LDPE rolling over and yielding market share so
easily. The resin is in big demand in countries where LLDPE is readily
available, but where processing equipment and expertise have not reached
the levels of North America or Europe, he says.
   Rob van Ooijen, PE manager at DSM, agrees. He adds that to compensate
for difficulties in processing LLDPE, an addition of 10 to 40% of LDPE can
act as a blending agent. Thus, some plants that run LLDPE may still need
low-density grades for processability. DSM is one of the few companies to
make recent investments in LDPE facilities. Van Ooijen says production has
been sold out.
   This year Union Carbide, Danbury, CT, is launching Ultra Tuflin, a
hexane-based LLDPE aimed at replacing LDPE. It reportedly offers up to 110%
more machine-direction tear strength (at 89 micron) than existing
higher-alpha-olefin LLDPE's.

RESINS REPORT 1996
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, EXPANDING MARKETS

   This is a dynamic time in resins supply. On one hand, technology is
expanding the properties and applications potential of materials. On the
other, burgeoning demand in developing countries is creating a huge market
for plastics, while influencing supply and pricing around the world.
   For processors, these trends signal opportunity and challenge. As the
following articles indicate, the capabilities of plastics design have never
been greater. New technologies, grades, and application concepts increase
market penetration.
   But growth can be difficult. The runup in demand for resins last year,
much of it influenced by inventory buying to offset shortages, stretched
production to the limit. Some resins remain in tight supply. New capacity
is coming on line, though, and 1996 is seen as a year of more balanced
supply and demand. Prices, moreover, should be relatively stable for most
resins.
   Modest economic growth is forecast for most of the industrialized world.
This should assure steady if unspectacular gains in resin consumption. In
developing countries, GDP growth and resin consumption will stay at
double-digit rates.
   This year will be one in which innovative technologies and expanding
markets define plastics use. With no major economic problems on the
horizon, and supply and pricing relatively stable, processors have the
foundation in place for a successful 1996.

STABILITY SEEMS TO BE AT HAND IN GLOBAL COMMODITY-RESINS MARKETS

By:
Robert D. Leaversuch

   Processors of large-volume resins have experienced an unusual degree of
chaos in buying raw materials over the past year. But industry seers
predict that 1996 holds the potential for greater stability (and so
predictability) in the cost and availability of polyolefin, styrenic, and
vinyl resins.
   ``Expect a reasonable equilibrium between demand and supply in 1996,''
says Jim Fisher, president of consultant IBMA, Princeton, NJ. He and other
consultants generally expect the prices of most volume resins to stabilize
at or near fourth-quarter 1995 levels early in the new year. But some
suppliers expect that a ``bounce,'' or slight upswing in prices, might
occur. One possible harbinger of this: Dow Chemical, Midland, MI, saying PE
is undervalued, announced a 5 cents/lb. across-the-board increase for Jan.
1.
   What disturbs processors most about an uneven pricing course is the
uncertainty it entails in strategic planning. Volatility, no matter how
slight, thwarts efforts to schedule production, control inventory, or
follow a business plan. An underlying concern about pricing is global
demand. Polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene are maintaining growth
rates, on average, at 50 to 100% higher than the typical increases in gross
domestic product for many countries, particularly developing nations.

Memories of recent cost carousel linger
   In 1994-95, volume-resin pricing took an erratic course worldwide
(graphs). Global interconnections in resin supply are apparent in parallel
pricing patterns for the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
   Overcapacity and low pricing levels for the various grades of PE, PP,
PS, and PVC had been widely projected for the period 1994-95. In fact,
mid-1994 prices stood close to historic lows. Crystal PS in the U.S. was at
45 cents/lb.; spot tags for PP homopolymer in Germany and PVC in Asia were
at $1000/metric ton.

Unforeseen scenarios thwart business plans
   But the unexpected intervened. A spate of natural and operational
difficulties struck resin and monomer plants worldwide at the turn of 1995,
pushing monomer costs up and disrupting resin supplies. A hoarding frenzy
and six-month-long inventory buildup followed. Moreover, resin exports to
China, a burgeoning market, kept soaring. At the May-June peak, PS had
risen by 26% in the U.S., PP by 35% in Germany, and PVC by 13% in Japan as
compared to mid-1994.
   Around mid-1995, a reversal was underway. IBMA's Fisher attributes this
to effects of the continuing recession in Japan, to slowdowns in France and
the U.K., China's sudden retreat from aggressive resin buying (which
depressed export prices), and a resultant inventory rundown. Major monomers
fell in cost, but less so than resin; supplier margins were squeezed.
   At presstime, all the large-volume resin prices had dropped from their
1995 peaks, typically by approximately 25% in the U.S. and about 40% in
Europe and Asia. Nevertheless, prices generally remain above the lows they
reached in 1994.
   Ron Yocum, CEO at Quantum Chemical Co., Cincinnati, OH, a major
polyolefins producer, says that the demand side for PE and PP remains
favorable. He pegs underlying PE growth at about 1.5 to 1.7 times that of
GDP. National economies obviously vary by region, but in the developed
countries, this could yield growth in the low single digits - generally on
the order of 3 to 5%/yr. In countries like China, where GDP is increasing
at double-digit rates, PE growth would be much greater.
   But why did official PE demand in one major market, the U.S., rise by
12% in 1994 and remain relatively flat in 1995? (Figures released at
presstime by the Society of the Plastics Industry, Washington, DC, show a
0.9% decline in production and a 3% drop in sales and captive use for PE in
the U.S.) Inventory shifts, brought about by turmoil in 1994-95, obscured a
real growth rate for 1995 of around 4 to 5%. Yocum sees continued growth
being aided by technology (e.g., super-condensing modes that double
LLD/HDPE capacity at 40 to 70% of cost), and improving polyolefins
cost-performance.
   In PP, suppliers expect underlying growth to be twice that of global GDP
through 2000.

Substantial growth seen in developing nations
   Long-term, demand prospects favor other resins, too. Developing
economies (e.g., China, India, parts of Latin America) represent a dramatic
source of growth for styrenics and PVC. For instance, PS use is booming in
Brazil. Alberto Carvalheiro, commercial director of EDN, the top PS
supplier there, puts domestic growth at 25% for 1994 (a boom period) and
10% for 1995. Underlying growth is 1.3 times GDP, and expanding PS use in
packaging and export products (appliances, toys, TV cabinets) is credited.
   A striking example of demand strength is Mexico. Despite the collapse of
the peso and a 10% decline in GDP, demand by packagers and export-oriented
processors for some resins in Mexico actually grew in 1995. Monica Conde,
an analyst with consultant IMPI, Mexico City, estimates that demand in
Mexico for polyethylene terephthalate, PP, and PS rose, respectively, by
38%, 8%, and 4% last year.
   By late 1995, some industry sources argue, the decline of prices for
large-volume resins had bottomed out in the U.S., with inventories becoming
more in balance. IBMA's Fisher, however, says softness in many European
economies makes it less likely that prices there will firm up as quickly.
He says that many countries in Europe have yet to fully address the high
social cost of their social welfare policies. The seers pepper their
forecasts with caveats, most notably discounting the impact of a possible
recession, or a new, unexpected round of plant shutdowns.
   Stable monomer costs are one reason cited for expecting more resin
stability in 1996. Fred Petersen of Probe Economics, Armonk, NY, who tracks
monomers, notes that ethylene, which gyrated from 16 to 28 cents/lb. in
1994-95, is now at 21 cents/lb. Currently announced ethylene expansions, if
carried out, should assure adequate ethylene supply for two years, Petersen
adds. Propylene and styrene are considered likely to tighten slowly, not
moving upward before 1997-98.

Planned capacity will meet demand
   As for resin capacity, experts foresee two major waves of expansion over
the next several years. In PE, for instance, North American-based suppliers
will add some 2.8 billion lb. (e.g., Novacor in Canada) in 1997-98, or
enough to almost balance new demand. A much larger spurt in capacity is set
to occur offshore, notably in the Far East. Most forecasts see world PE
capacity rising by 16% through 1998.
   Bill Kuhlke of consultant Kuhlke Assoc., Houston, TX, puts today's
global PE operating rate at 86%. He sees growth absorbing added capacity by
1998. Utilization rates by then would rise to 91%, which would put new
pressure on pricing.
   Super-condensing-type modes for LLD/HDPE plants developed by BP
Chemicals, Exxon Chemical, and Union Carbide make a second PE expansion
feasible. But the impact won't be felt before 1999.
   In styrenics, consultants foresee crystal grades averaging 48 cents/lb.
in 1996, a figure that is close to current levels. Added capacity in the
styrene-importing regions (Western Europe and the Far East) is seen causing
a 50% drop in U.S. exports. Ed Glatzer of Chem Systems anticipates styrene
averaging 36 cents/lb. in 1996 and 33 cents/lb. in 1997, which would help
keep PS and ABS prices low.
   In vinyl, Richard Roman, Roman Assoc., Cleveland, OH, sees a
supply-demand balance lasting several years. New capacity will about match
anticipated growth. The U.S. and Eastern European producers, moreover, are
likely to be export bases for meeting the PVC needs of developing nations.

STRONG GROWTH WILL CARRY OVER INTO DIVERSE MARKETS AND APPLICATIONS

By:
Robert Colvin, with Stephen Moore in Tokyo

   Polypropylene is the only olefin resin in North America, Western Europe,
and Japan to have registered substantive growth last year. The material
showed most gains in blow molded containers (North America), sheet,
profile, and film extrusion, and injection molded packaging.
   These results stem from end-use growth and polypropylene's continuing
versatility as a resin, which is expanding its use in areas like
packaging.
   The results in North America, at least, also reflect a shift that took
place in inventory and production last year. In 1994, U.S. sales of most
commodity resins were at double-digit levels - at times beyond the
abilities of production capacity, according to Kevin Boyle of Occidental
Chemical Corp., Dallas, TX, chairman of the Society of the Plastics
Industry's Committee on Resin Statistics. This in turn led to a run on
purchasing, which shifted inventories of volume resins from producers to
converters. As buying slowed in 1995, inventories shifted back to
producers, with the result being that in the U.S., while production of all
plastics rose 3.4% in 1995 over 1994, total sales and captive use increased
by only 0.3%, according to figures released by the SPI at a press briefing
in its Washington, DC, headquarters on Dec. 6, 1995.

Resin's strength lifted U.S. production figures
   Though SPI began including Canadian sales with those of the U.S. in PP
last year, thus making year-to-year comparisons with 1994 difficult, Boyle
noted during the press briefing that had PP production been deleted from
1995 U.S. resin figures, thermoplastics production would have declined by
half, to 1.7% over 1994.
   In many global markets polypropylene producers are, however,
anticipating a first-quarter turnaround from fourth-quarter 1995. If this
happens, processors will find plenty of material - inventories at many
suppliers are reportedly hovering at around 6 to 7 weeks' supply. Prices,
moreover, should remain at or around current levels in most areas. No wild
fluctuations are predicted. Nor do many experts foresee PP supply
tightening before 1999.
   Consultant Phillip Townsend Assoc. Inc. (PTAI), Houston, TX, projects an
average annual growth in worldwide PP consumption of 7.2% between 1994 and
1999.
   Continuing advances in PP performance are strengthening its
price/properties ratio. A number of manufacturers have come up with ways to
improve properties and thus bridge the performance gap between the resin
and select engineering polymers. Examples include the Hivalloy
polymerization process from Montell, Wilmington, DE; injection molding
grades of impact copolymer from Fina Oil & Chemical Co., Dallas, and new
Controlled Crystallinity PP (CCPP) resins manufactured by Borealis, Lyngby,
Denmark.
   Some observers estimate that as much as two-thirds of PP's consumption
increase is at the expense of other thermoplastics. Robert Woods, business
manager for PP at Quantum Chemical, Cincinnati, OH, says that due to gains
in clarity, renewed interest has surfaced in PP as a substitute for PET in
some dairy and food containers such as peanut butter jars.
   Rexene Products Co., meanwhile, has a developmental PP-based flexible
polymer, Rexflex FPO, which the Dallas-based supplier claims will pull
automotive market share from PUR and foamed PVC, by virtue of its improved
melt strength and a 35% lower density than PVC.
   Joseph T. Bonk, specialty polymers manager, says automotive applications
are expected to include skin-covered foamed instrument panels whose
strength will be that they are made from a single resin - PP - thus 
facilitating recycling. Since the material contains no plasticizers, window
fogging is not a problem. To meet expected FPO demand, Rexene is building a
50-million-lb./yr. facility in Odessa, TX, that is to come on stream in the
third quarter.

Asia remains large growth market
   Outside North America, Western Europe, and Japan, the demand equation
for PP changes radically. Consultant Andrew Stevens at PTAI, for example,
sees average annual growth for Asia (excluding Japan) of 11.5% through
1999.
   Demand for PP in China remains high and is growing by as much as 11%
annually. Present local production stands at 2.64 billion lb./yr. compared
with demand of 4.4 billion lb./yr. By 2010, some 8.65 billion lb./yr. will
be needed. Because local producers won't be able to meet demand, observers
predict that imports will not only meet consumption needs in China, but
have a ripple effect on global supply. Assuming demand remains constant and
price is attractive, excess capacity could flow to China and create tight
supplies elsewhere.
   Tianjin United Chemical, Tianjin, China, has just started up an
882-million-lb./yr. PP plant based on Montell technology. Two other
882-million-lb./yr. plants have also come on stream: one in Guangdong,
financed by Hong Kong and Taiwanese investors, and one at the Zhongyuan
Petrochemical Union, which uses Montell technology.
   Other important PP markets include India with about 16% yearly growth
potential. India, despite a population of about 950 million, has one of the
lowest per-capita plastics consumption rates in the world, about 1 kg. (2.2
lb.) The average global consumption rate is around 16 kg. (35 lb.) The
U.S., by contrast, consumes about 60 kg. (132 lb.) of plastics/person. The
potential for PP (as well as other resins) is thus tremendous.
   Major players like Reliance Industries, Bombay, and Indian
Petrochemicals, Baroda, are expanding capacities. Domestic PP capacity
should rise to 1.19 billion lb./yr. by 1996 and to 2.64 billion lb./yr. by
2000. Reliance is setting up a 771-million-lb./yr. plant at Jamnagar in
addition to a 771-million-lb./yr. facility at Hazira. This capacity will
make it the sub-continent's largest PP producer.
   Elsewhere in the region, Pakistan's Ravi Chemicals Group, in a joint
venture with British-based Alyph Ltd., is to build a 154-million-lb./yr.
plant in Karachi - the country's first. Pakistan uses 110 million lb./yr.
The balance is for export.

Production expansions, consolidations proceed
   Capacity expansions and realignments are, of course, ongoing everywhere.
In Japan last year there was the merger of Tokyo-based Showa Denko and
Nippon Petrochemicals, which created a polyolefins giant offering 762
million lb./yr. of capacity. This was followed by further consolidation in
the Japanese market with a union between Mitsui Petrochemical Industries
and Ube Industries, in Tokyo, to offer 992 million lb./yr. of nameplate
capacity.

New capacity is coming on stream
   Europe has 14 PP suppliers. Among them is Dow Europe, Horgen,
Switzerland, which has plans to build a 440-million-lb./yr. plant at Buna
in the former East Germany.
   In Africa, meanwhile, Hoechst AG, Frankfurt, Germany, has increased
capacity from 132 million lb./yr. to 330 million lb. at its 50:50 joint
venture in Sasolburg, South Africa.
   In the U.S., Solvay Polymers, Houston, TX, is building a gas-phase
reactor and also debottlenecking lines to increase capacity from 440
million lb./yr. to 770 million lb. at Deer Park, TX, this year.
   Exxon Chemical Co., which is also based in Houston, has plans to build a
527-million-lb./yr. plant in Baytown, TX.

Many plants are built, few are being closed
   Will all this capacity be needed? Particularly in Europe where many
observers have complained for several years that there is already too much
capacity in place from too many producers?
   Observers point out that although a number of plants are going up, few
older ones are being decommissioned. Among the reasons that are cited for
this, according to Quantum's Woods, is that it may be easier to keep older
plants operating than to pay the cost of shuttering them and cleaning up
the property. Regulation not only influences plastics use, but affects the
economics of production as well.

VOLUME IS BEGINNING TO BUILD AS END-USERS ASSESS RESINS' BENEFITS

By:
Robert D. Leaversuch

   Metallocene-catalyzed polyolefins have generated much notice. But 1996
may be a watershed in determining their impact.
   Until now, metallocene polyethylene (mPE) and polypropylene (mPP) resins
have been circumscribed by narrow (though widening) grade slates,
confidential R&D, and patent disputes. Small, dedicated resin units
operate, but their capacity is less than 0.5% of market potential.
   Now, the catalysts are being retrofit to full-scale units for every
major polymerization process, which puts them into the production
mainstream. The trio of current mPE suppliers (Exxon, Dow, and Mitsui)
becomes a pack in 1996. Five suppliers are set to launch mPP grades.
Processors can also expect mPE and perhaps mPP technology to be licensed by
other producers before 1996 is over (table).
   The materials could help to sustain plastics growth rates at historic
levels (i.e., double the GDP). ``Metallocenes potentially allow polyolefins
to replace [some] higher-cost performance materials,'' states Ron Yocum,
CEO at Quantum Corp.
   There's little doubt among processors and suppliers that mPE and mPP can
offer cost-performance gains across a swath of specialty markets.
Metallocene PE is commercial, in the U.S., in niches like
controlled-permeation films (e.g., produce bags) and low-residuals wire and
cable, and, in Europe, flexible hosing.
   In dispute is how fast and how far grades can go in ``pseudo-commodity''
markets. Pseudo-commodity applications use volume resins like PE and PP,
but require property enhancements, like clarity and toughness, which
justify a premium and are attainable via metallocene catalysis.
   Examples are some clarity films (now served by LDPE), stretch film
(typically higher-alpha-olefin LLDPE), and flexibles (plasticized vinyl and
rubber).
   Consultants foresee 1996-98 as a time when mPE and mPP extend their
reach (most rapidly in the U.S.) to larger markets: e.g., stretch film
(superior toughness and cling), molded medical parts, and polymer
modifiers.

Battling constraints in metallocenes' use
   ``There's no doubt about mPE's specialties role; what's less clear is
end-user commitment in volume markets,'' says John Murphy of Catalyst
Consultants Inc., Spring Hills, PA. One reason for end-user ambiguity is
the desire to keep a low profile to retain a competitive advantage. More
substantive reasons for questioning the growth of metallocene materials use
have been resin capacity limits, cost, and processability.
   ``Capacity limits are no longer a realistic long-term constraint,''
declares Bob Bauman, of consultant Chem Systems, Tarrytown, NY. He says
that in the past year, a number of suppliers have run mPE in gas-phase,
slurry, loop, and high-pressure process units (table). Retrofits involve
upgrading a unit's catalyst delivery system and changing reactor
conditions, both done at modest cost.
   Exxon has run 30 million lb. of mPE on a 1-billion-lb./yr. gas-phase
plant in the U.S. Thus, it seems feasible to capitalize on mPE benefits
without building specialized or dedicated capacity - a view also taken by
BP, Union Carbide, and Mobil. In theory, at least, it is feasible to use a
new type of swing capacity - units that shift between metallocene and
conventional catalysts.
   Other sources point out the practical limits to retrofitting metallocene
catalysts to units. In fact (as with current LLDPE/HDPE swing units), this
capability is likely to be used rarely, since units are large and
inflexible. Except in large volumes, shifting between grades and catalysts
adds downtime, increases off-spec transition material, cuts throughput, and
raises cost.
   A common strategy is to convert small, often aging, reactors to mPE, an
approach taken by Union Carbide, Hoechst, BASF, and BP. David James,
Carbide's R&D director, suggests that dedicated plants best optimize
comonomer use at present (metallocenes being 10-fold more efficient than
regular catalysts).
   Dow favors dedicated capacity. It has announced a 300% increase in
worldwide mPE (tradename Insite) capacity for 1996. This includes a second
125-million-lb./yr. unit in the U.S., and a 150-million-lb. unit in Spain.
Len Azzaro, PE commercial director, says LLDPEs using Insite technology
will be made at a 400-million-lb./yr. unit by late 1996.

Cost is an issue: will premium stay or be cut?
   Metallocene PE catalyst costs 1 to 1.5 cents/lb. more than HAO-LLDPE
catalyst. This helps make mPE 10 to 15% costlier than LLDPE. And it creates
a dilemma: dedicated units cost more to run, volumes do not yet justify
dedicating full-scale units, and economies of scale are adverse. Balaji
Singh of consultant Phillip Townsend Assoc., Houston, TX, says suppliers
must pare mPE costs to gain share. He sees catalyst costs falling to under
1 to 1.5 cents/lb. in excess of LLDPE in five years.
   In theory, this should lower resin prices. But Bill Kuhlke of consultant
Kuhlke Assoc., Houston, TX, expects suppliers (with an estimated $3.3
billion in metallocenes investment) to keep premiums up, perhaps for as
long as 15 years, to pay back costs of development and in capacity. Others
say the market will determine price, payback notwithstanding.
   Exxon and BP plan to run mPE on large-scale gas reactors. This could
entail high operating costs, but they see it as the best way to seed
markets as demand grows. Eventually, mPE volumes would rise, and a
full-scale plant could be dedicated. Estimates of when this crossover might
occur range from five to 10 years.
   Suppliers cite gains in making mPE more processable. Singh notes that a
shift to metallocenes in markets like stretch film and medical moldings can
be a ``minor headache'' for processors versus shifting from LDPE to LLDPE.
   Horst Maack, president of consultant Maack Business Services, Au,
Switzerland, questions whether mPE can be run in Europe's (mostly LDPE)
process equipment by just tweaking machinery. Maack says mPE involves
higher conversion costs for those adopting mPE in film in Europe. Changes
in screws, die gaps, feed sections, and winding equipment add 5% to 30% to
investment. And mPE also runs hotter than conventional PE, so throughputs
could fall and costly controls may be needed.
   ``A landslide in volume markets in Europe is likely when mPE matches
LDPE's processability,'' says Maack. He sees 200,000 tons (400 million lb.)
of mPE use in Europe by 2000.
   Hartz Mann, BASF's PE applications director, sees blending as one way to
introduce mPE in Europe. BASF's tubular LDPE capacity is said to be optimal
for plastomer versions (grades of 0.886 to 0.910 g./cc. density). Slurry
process units may prove most suitable for high-density mPEs.
   Penetration by mPE and mPP technologies also depends on licensing.
Exxon, with a broad stake in patents, and alliances with Hoechst
(catalyst), Mitsui (gas-phase process), and DSM (plastomers), may have an
edge. But licensing also requires a servicing and know-how infrastructure,
which may give Union Carbide and BP an inside track.
   Roland Hingmann, BASF's R&D director for polypropylene, says that
running mPP in PP plants is feasible, if not as simple as for mPE. The
ability has, in fact, been demonstrated by Hoechst, Exxon, BASF, and others
in gas and slurry reactors. BASF is promoting with its technology improved
homopolymer, controlled-rheology grades, high-stiffness and -toughness
copolymers, and reactor TPOs.


These are the top contenders in the drive to commercialize technology for
production of metallocene-based polymers*

DEMAND MATCHES GDP GROWTH IN DEVELOPED NATIONS, SURGES IN ASIA

By:
Joseph A. Grande


   Last year ABS demand stabilized in many areas and approached more
traditional growth rates.
   Use of ABS showed a decline of about 8% in the U.S., the first drop in
four years, while Europe managed a slight gain. Consumption was strong in
Japan, which posted an 8% gain, the first significant increase in five
years. Meanwhile, the rest of the Far East had double-digit growth. The
overall performance was a distinct contrast to 1994, which saw
above-average consumption.
   ``Performance in 1994 was not real growth because we were coming out of
deep recession,'' says Harald Laesche, ABS product manager at Bayer AG,
Leverkusen, Germany. As a result, observers say 1995's weaker numbers
should be viewed within the market's overall performance of the last five
years. During that period, ABS has grown about 3% annually, in line with
GDP growth of developed countries, says Ulf Buergel, business manager of
styrene copolymers for Dow Europe, Horgen, Switzerland.

Bayer acquisition changes global scene
   The lineup of global players changed last year, as Bayer revealed plans
to purchase Monsanto's ABS business. The move will more than double Bayer's
capacity and propel it into the top tier of ABS producers, alongside Chi
Mei and GE Plastics.
   A global study of the styrenics business by consultant Chem Systems,
Tarrytown, NY, predicts 5 to 6% annual growth through 2000. Mature U.S. and
European markets will see marginal gains.
   Demand in Japan will grow at an average of 1.6% over the next three
years, led by toys, leisure goods, and construction, according to the Japan
ABS Resin Industry Assn., Tokyo. Use in vehicles will decrease due to lower
production volumes and increased substitution of PP. Meanwhile, exports are
forecast to grow at an average annual rate of 9.2%. Hot destinations are
China, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia.
   The rest of the Far East will enjoy double-digit growth, says Edward
Glatzer of Chem Systems.
   In inter-polymer substitution, competition with PS and PP is at
equilibrium, suppliers claim. High-impact PS and PP continue to nip at ABS,
however, particularly in appliances that were over-engineered in ABS. In
European autos, governmental requirements for impact at low temperature may
bring back interiors that had been switched to PP.
   One bright spot last year was continued demand for ABS and ABS/PC blends
in computers and telecommunications. Growth is spurred by miniaturization
and the ability of materials to provide thin walls, strength, and high
processability. These blends are growing at a 15 to 20% rate in
applications such as cellular phones and notebook computers. On the other
hand, ABS has seen significant erosion in computer monitors and keyboards.
PS has gained a strong foothold based on cost and lower physical
requirements.
   A key target for GE Plastics is building and construction. The firm is
pushing Cycolac ABS, coextruded with a capstock of
acrylic/styrene/acrylonitrile, for window profiles, cladding, and other
components.
   Most of the world's capacity buildup is in Asia. Chi Mei, Tainan,
Taiwan, has plans to construct a 441-million to 882-million-lb./yr. plant
in Singapore or Malaysia. The company also plans to boost capacity in
Taiwan to 2.6 billion lb./yr. by 1998.
   Toray Industries, Tokyo, will double capacity in Malaysia to 353 million
lb./yr. by summer, making it the largest ABS facility in Southeast Asia.
   Improved processability remains crucial. At Dow, new Magnum ABS grades
provide lower plateout and double the melt flow rate.

SPECIALTY GRADES PROMISE GROWTH DESPITE SHORTAGES OF GLASS FIBERS

By:
Peter Mapleston


   Supply problems for nylon compounds have much to do with the
availability of glass-fiber reinforcements. A shortage in fibers occurred
after a fast pick-up in demand that started in 1994 and carried through
first-half 1995.
   Glass-fiber prices also moved up over 15% in 1995, though they are still
at sub-1980's levels. This year could see them rise again, from 5% into
double digits, depending on market conditions, which are softening in
areas.
   Another issue is the decision by Owens Corning to phase out 10-micron
fibers favored by many compounders (mostly European) and focus on 11- and
14-micron fibers that are less costly to produce. That's reflected in the
price: OCF 14-micron fibers sell for around 15% less than 10-micron
grades.
   At Hoechst-Celanese in Dallas, TX, nylon 66 product manager Chuck
Calhoun says the company has ``outstanding'' glass fiber-reinforced
products that rely on very fine fibers for much of their performance -
performance that could be hard to reproduce with thicker types.
   Jim Morelli, sales and marketing director at AlliedSignal, Morristown,
NJ, is sanguine. Allied's Capron nylon 6 grades ``are very forgiving. We
can use a significant number of types of fibers.''
   Resin-wise, if demand stays around 7%/yr., there should be no problems
in nylon 66 supply. Nylon 6 supply is less critical, due largely to a
slackening in the fibers market that enables polymer makers to divert
material to compounds. In Europe especially, millions of pounds of polymer
from ex-East Bloc countries are available. Nylon 66 prices are thus firm,
while nylon 6 price is under downward pressure.
   While the auto market in North America is flat overall, growth in nylons
will come through increased penetration into manifolds. Japanese car makers
are also switching to nylon manifolds.
   Prospects, in fact, look good for nylon 6 in air-intake manifolds.
Glass-reinforced compounds perform as well or better than 66 in parts
assembled by vibration welding, which is replacing lost-core injection
molding for manifolds fitted to some European cars. Allied says Capron HPN
(high-productivity nylon) 6 grades, initially for packaging, may be
preferable to 66 in lost-core molding, since their high flow improves cycle
times and reduces core shift. The company claims the grades allow
productivity gains of 20 to 30% over standard nylon 6.
   Bayer has programs with auto-makers for making large parts using hybrid
technology in which plastics, often nylons, are molded around large metal
inserts. Parts include cross-car beams, door panels, and seat frames.
   At Hoechst-Celanese, Calhoun cites good growth in niche automotive
electronics, as well as in components for suspension systems called
spring-seat spacers. The components, each around 4 oz., replace fabricated
metal, saving weight and cost.
   Several companies are introducing nylons with improved high-temperature
properties (Dec MP, 74). DuPont has added Zytel HTN semi-aromatic grades in
Europe. Main target is automotive - fog-lamp housings, ignition parts,
sensors, components for ABS brakes - but several electronics applications
are turning up for dimensional stability and heat resistance. Grades have a
glass-transition temperature 135 degrees F. higher than nylon 66;
properties are marginally affected by water uptake. Creep is low.
   Most activity for nylons in packaging is in films with improved barrier.
EMS-Chemie, Domat/Ems, Switzerland, has introduced what it terms
``multi-polyamides'' that contain over three types of nylon, and in some
cases as many as five. The copolymers are for niches such as cheese
packaging, to prevent the ballooning that occurs when cheese gases can't
escape through skin packaging.
   The materials replace PVdC in multilayer structures. According to EMS,
they are as good as PVdC at keeping oxygen out of the pack, and better at
letting carbon dioxide out. The materials are also said to be easier to
process than PVdC. Their low melt point and crystallinity suit them for
biaxial orientation.

SURGING DEMAND IN HIGH-GROWTH REGIONS BUOYS END-USE OUTLOOK

By:
Martin O'Neill


   Polyvinyl chloride sales were generally even in North America and
Western Europe last year, and off substantially (approximately 9.5%) in
Japan. Reasons for the material's performance in these regions, apart from
the continuing recession in Japan, include a second-half decline in
economically sensitive end-use markets like housing starts and general
construction, conversion to competitive materials like PET and PP in
packaging, and, to a degree, issues of recyclability.
   Exports, however, were up in many areas, notably from the U.S. (about
1.4 billion lb. - a 20% jump from 1994); also, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, and
Eastern Europe. Factors influencing this range from the weakness of the
U.S. dollar to European currencies like the German mark (though the price
differential is not as pronounced as it was in 1994), to overcapacity in
Japan chasing developing market opportunities in Asia.
   The outlook for PVC use this year varies by region. Since PVC demand
tends to follow GDP growth in the developed nations, average growth is
forecast for North America and Western Europe. Some economists predict
economic growth in the 2 to 2.6% range for the Group of Seven nations - the
U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan - primarily
as a result of efforts to reduce budget deficits. Others predict that some
national economies will experience less growth - as little as 1.3% in the
U.S., for example. The winner would appear to be Japan, for which growth of
2.1% is forecast by some experts for 1996 - low compared to many countries,
but a substantial jump from the 0.1% growth predictions for 1995 that were
made late last year.
   In other areas, PVC could see sizeable growth. Infrastructure repair,
for example, will continue in Eastern Europe, creating demand for window
profiles. The growing economies of some Latin American countries and the
continuing strength of Asia bode well for PVC use in these areas.
   And while PET continues to take share away from PVC in packaging, some
applications are holding firm while others are reverting to the material.
In France, Evian has switched from PVC to PET bottles for its mineral
water, and Vittel will follow suit this year. Yet due to its price, PVC
continues to play a major role in bottled water. In film, one European
grocery chain is changing back to PVC from polyethylene for meat wrap, to
get a shelf life of 2 to 4 days versus 24 hr. with PE.
   The bright spot in the PVC market, as with other resins, is Asia, where
capacity and demand are increasing, albeit from a relatively low starting
point. Joint ventures among Japanese, South Korean, and Western companies
are prominent, but domestic development is also strong.
   Thailand was a net exporter of PVC for the first time in 1994. It has
embarked on an ambitious expansion program that could see it become the
world's largest supplier in the next decade.
   India's PVC market is expected to grow from 1.03 billion lb. to 1.76
billion lb. by 2000, according to industry estimates.
   Demand for PVC in Vietnam is 110 million lb./yr., but growing by 20%
annually. Occidental Chemical Corp, Dallas, TX, and trading house Marubeni
Corp., Osaka, Japan, are establishing a 220-million-lb./yr. suspension
plant in southern Vietnam, which is due on stream by 1998. The venture,
Oxy-Vina Plastics and Chemical Co., is the first involving a U.S.
corporation in that country since resumption of diplomatic relations
between America and Vietnam last year.
   In China, PVC capacity is about 3.3 billion lb./yr. Imports amounted to
1.07 billion lb. in 1994, including copolymers. The country plans to
complete three plants before 1998, increasing capacity by 352 million
lb./yr., according to the Ministry of Chemical Industry.

REGIONAL GROWTH, OVERCAPACITY MAY CHANGE PATTERNS OF SUPPLY

By:
Martin O'Neill


   The phenomenal growth of PET in packaging over the last 20 years may be
slowing in mature markets, like North America, but its potential in largely
untapped markets assures solid growth for the foreseeable future.
   G. Keith Mitchell, director of consultant PCI Ltd., in London, noted the
potential for PET in several regions at a conference late last year
sponsored by The Packaging Group Inc., Milltown, NJ. Per-capita consumption
in North America and Europe is, respectively, 3362 and 1150 g. But it's
only 520 g./person in South America, 270 g. in the Middle East and Africa,
and 220 g./person in Asia-Pacific.
   Overall, observers say the outlook for 1996 is ``snug,'' with Europe
projected to import up to 363 million lb. of resin this year, a 7.8%
increase over 1995. The North American supply-demand ratio should be
relatively balanced in 1996, with quantities available for export to Europe
and South America. Much surplus capacity exists in Asia and Asia-Pacific,
where output is 20% for domestic use and 80% for export.
   Meanwhile, the capacity buildup continues worldwide, and will have an
impact as soon as next year. In 1997, Europe's PET imports are projected by
Mitchell to decline to 15 million lb. In 1998, he forecasts that Europe
will be a net exporter, capable of shipping 321 million lb.
   By 1997-98, if all the capacity that's under construction or planned
comes on line, says Guido Ghisolfi, CEO of Sinco Engineering, an Italian
builder of PET plants, there could be global overcapacity of 6.6 billion
lb.
   Among changes that experts like Ghisolfi see from this is a demand by
the major end-users of PET to stabilize the resin's price structure
worldwide. Ghisolfi says that about 10 multinationals (e.g., Nestle,
Unilever, Coca-Cola) consume 60% of PET. If such overcapacity occurs, it
would be a buyer's market, and the volumes these end-users consume will
give them much leverage in pressing for price stability - even to insisting
that prices not be tied entirely to raw materials' costs.
   Such observations are speculative. Yet expansions continue.
   Eastman Chemical is building in Spain and Latin America, and targets 3.4
billion lb. in place globally in late 1998.
   Hoechst will triple capacity to over 3 billion lb. by 2000, and may
build in Asia.
   Shell Chemicals will bring North American capacity to 1.1 billion
lb./yr. In Italy, capacity will be doubled to 352 million lb./yr. by early
1997, in Patrica.
   ICI has a U.S. plant in precommission, which will boost North American
capacity to 363 million lb./yr. A 264-million-lb./yr. European plant will
come on stream this year, raising the regional total to 484 million
lb./yr.
   Meanwhile, Dow Europe has entered the PET business via an agreement with
Enichem, whereby Dow acquires 80% of its Inca Intl. subsidiary in Italy.
   In Japan, Kaneko is adding a 33-million-lb./yr. unit in Sabae to
complement its 55-million-lb./yr. plant in Hofu.
   Mitsui Petrochemical has absorbed Mitsui PET Resin Co., its bottle-grade
marketing arm, to combine its PET and purified terephthalic acid
activities.
   And China's Shantou Oceanic Group recently obtained approval to build
PET film and bottle-grade resin plants. Japanese sources believe China's
total PET resin capacity will grow from 3.8 billion lb./yr. in 1994 to 5.3
billion lb./yr. in 1997. Nonetheless, the country is expected to remain a
net importer of the resin through the 1990s.

RESIN SHORTAGE SHOULD EASE THIS YEAR AS CAPACITY COMES ON STREAM

By:
Peter Mapleston


   The market for PC has been tight, due to high demand (10 to 12% growth
in late 1995) and supply problems experienced by several producers last
year.
   But relief is coming. This year there will be 135 million lb./yr. more
in GE's Burkville, AL, plant, and a further expansion of undisclosed size
at Bergen op Zoom, in The Netherlands. Bayer is debottlenecking three
plants, in Belgium, Germany, and the U.S.; and it is considering adding a
third line in Antwerp, Belgium. Dow is also debottlenecking. Bayer,
meanwhile, awaits approval - possibly in the first quarter - for a
25-million-lb./yr. plant in China.
   The net result of these expansions, says Bayer vp. Mark Witman, is that
supply will be back in balance in 1997.
   ``Demand will be strong in 1996, but not as strong as in 1995,'' says
Dow Chemical's PC business director Mike Murry, in Midland, MI. GE's Lexan
manager in Europe, Robert Williams, expects a slowdown in growth to as
little as 5%/yr.
   Meanwhile, prices rose over 10% last year, with the highest jump in the
Far East, where they are near twice those of mid-1994, compared to some 40%
higher in Europe. Suppliers expect prices to stick in 1996.
   Growth in the Far East remains strong. Production of PC in Japan was
likely to exceed 450 million lb. last year. Demand is fueled by electronics
and exports. With Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and South Korea active importers
of Japanese PC, exports are again expected to account for over half of
Japanese shipments. Coupled with increases in domestic use, Japanese
shipments may rise 10% in 1995, versus 35% in 1994.
   Korean demand for PC is seen surpassing 50 million lb. in 1995, owing to
growth in electronics and automotive. The market is expected to continue
its dependence on imports until the only polymer maker, Samyung Kasei,
completes an expansion to 66 million lb./yr. at the end of 1997.
   Demand for PC in China, mainly from processors in Guangdong, will likely
double by 2000. China imports almost all its PC. Local producers have
capacity of 5.5 million lb./yr., but production problems have seen output
dwindle to under 2.2 million lb./yr.
   Production of CDs for music, computer data, and (soon) movies will
provide double-digit growth through the decade, with some putting the
figure at around 25%/yr. Bayer, GE, and Japan's Teijin are leaders in this
sector; Dow has a grade in development.
   Bayer is working on film insert molding for automotive and other
applications. First commercial use of the technology has been small parts
on which the film provides functional markings on switches and dials. Films
will be used for esthetics on larger parts. Films coming out of Bayer's
plant in Berlin, CT, coextrusions of PC and thermoplastic polyurethane,
have a soft touch.
   Prospects for PC blends in bumpers don't look good. GE, however, is
getting Xenoy used in body panels (mostly fenders) on limited-edition cars
as well as trucks. And it will supply material for the plastics-bodied
Smart car to be built by the Mercedes-Swatch venture in 1997 or 1998.
   Packaging activity revolves around multitrip containers for milk and
water. Dairies in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland have switched to PC
bottles, which can make 50 trips or more. Consumers like them because they
open more easily than cartons and are lighter than glass. Retailers like
them because, being square, they fit better onto pallets and require 30%
less space.
   Three- and 5-gal. containers for mineral water are finding more use.
Bayer cites double-digit growth in Europe, the Far East, and South America,
and says the potential market is 10 times higher than today.

WELCOME TO A `WORLDWIDE WEB'

By:
Patrick A. Toensmeier

   In 1996, MODERN PLASTICS will offer its own version of a ``worldwide
web.'' The ``web sites'' will be international plastics shows. Our ``web
servers'' will be tabloids developed for each show and distributed
on-site.
   There will be at least seven shows so covered. They are, as highlighted
on the map: Aseanplast, in Jakarta (Mar. 12-15); Argenplas, in Buenos Aires
(Apr. 18-24); Plastexpo, Lyon, France (May 21-24); Mercoplast, Rio de
Janeiro (Aug. 20-21); International Plastics Fair, Tokyo (Oct. 11-15);
Ausplas, Melbourne, Australia (Oct. 22-26); and Interplas, Birmingham,
England (Nov. 10-14). We may also produce a tabloid for Chinaplas, in
Beijing (Mar. 26-30), and for Equiplast, in Barcelona, Spain (Oct. 20-25).
   The tabloids will feature information about new products on display at
each show. They will also include overviews of local markets, business
trends, and other issues of interest to processors.
   Importantly, the news that MODERN PLASTICS acquires in developing these
tabloids, and in covering the shows, will be reported in the magazine as
well. And the contacts that our editors make in this process will help us
to provide, on a continuing basis, the information and perspective on
process technology, market issues, and business trends our readers need for
their decision-making.
   We will, of course, have a presence at more expositions this year.
MODERN PLASTICS' global editorial staff will cover over 20 shows around the
world in 1996. Show coverage may seem routine. But it's an opportunity for
readers to review the latest developments in materials and machinery that
can contribute to the capability and profitability of their operations.
   In today's global economy, trade shows are not local events. The
products and technologies they feature have an impact on companies
worldwide. Show coverage is part of the continuing effort by MODERN
PLASTICS to keep readers in step with developments that affect their
businesses, no matter where they do business.

MODULAR INJECTION MACHINES SUIT A WIDE RANGE OF REQUIREMENTS

By:
EDITED BY MERLE R. SNYDER

   The Allrounder S models have further extended the degree of modularity
in Arburg's injection molding machines to incorporate units for all levels
of sophistication. The company has introduced two models, with platen
tiebar distances of 220 by 220 mm. and 270 by 270 mm. Both accept clamp
units with clamp forces of either 17 or 28 ton, and injection units with
Euromap designations 60 and 150.
   These are all standard equipment. The 60 injection unit takes cylinder
modules with diameters of 18, 22, and 25 mm., while the 150 version takes
25-, 30-, and 35-mm barrels. The standard control is the Selogica, with a
32-bit multiprocessor and a monochrome flat screen.
   The 220S model with 17-ton clamp replaces Arburg's 170CMD, which will
cease production in the second quarter (Arburg gave up production of larger
CMD models two years ago). These two new machines go into series production
in February, and are part of what will eventually be a complete line.
   Arburg says special attention was paid to floor-space requirements,
noise emissions (maximum noise level is 72 dB) and ergonomic design. For
example, mold-temperature control units can be fixed onto the frame of the
machine and plugged into cooling water distribution channels integrated
into the machine base. Other peripherals can also be positioned in the
immediate vicinity of the machine. With high-end Selogica controls,
multi-axis robots can be programmed directly from the machine control
panel.
   Electrical interfaces are integrated into the base, at front and rear.
The water-cooled electrical cabinet on the front of the machine is divided
in two, with 23-v. electronics on one side and 230-v. electronics on the
other.
   There are four pump combinations on the hydraulics. The basic machine
has a servo valve for movements and pressure hold, a main pump, and a
manual cooling water distributor. Users can opt for extended hydraulics to
enable injection and clamp movements to run parallel, motor capacity can be
increased, and there are levels of regulation for the injection unit and
for cooling water distribution.
   The clamp unit employs a double-piston system that is highly compact and
also provides good force distribution. The hydraulic valves are attached
directly to the rear face or (for core pullers) on top of the third platen,
and oil is pumped straight to the pistons, without need for hose
attachments.
   The central hydraulics unit at the rear of the machine is
self-contained, and is easily fixed to the machine base. Replacement where
possible of hoses by fixed metal pipes makes assembly easier and also
increases precision in use, since the pipes have fixed volumes. Arburg
Inc., P.O. Box 311178, Newington, CT 06131

DIE DESIGN CUTS FLOW HANGUPS

   Extrusion dies of the LI series for multilumen profiles are made from
Carpenter Custom 630 (17-4 PH) stainless steel, heat-treated to a hardness
of 44 Rockwell C, providing excellent corrosion resistance for many
polymers, high strength, and surface finish durability. All wetted surfaces
are polished to an 8-micro-in. mirror surface finish. Smooth, profiled, and
polished resin flow paths reduce areas of melt stagnation. The LI dies are
designed with a melt thermocouple immersed into the polymer stream to
provide exact melt temperature; also, a flow-through mandrel to insure web
consistency. Profile configurations are available with up to eight lumens
and are supplied in an in-line die arrangement. Push-out screws are built
into all precision diameter interfaces to ease disassembly. Dual-thread
bushing permits operator adjustment with 0.014 in. (0.36 mm.) travel/turn
of the adjuster screw for high-precision profile centering capability.

GRAVIMETRIC BLENDER

   GRAVIMETRIC BLENDER. Model 400 VME-II combines the economy of slide-gate
metering with an accuracy that reportedly rivals auger metering. Its double
``V'' slide gate design gives consistent material flow through the
discharge opening even when ingredient ratios are as low as 1%. This allows
the computer to determine the amount of material falling between the
metering device and the weigh hopper. To facilitate fast changeover, the
unit has easily removable weigh hopper, slide gate and auger units and
large clean-out doors. Menu-driven format simplifies operation. A movable
control panel stores up to 99 recipes, inventories all material, and
calculates average use rate. HydReclaim Corp., 3145 Copper Avenue, Fenton,

TWO-MATERIAL MACHINE

   TWO-MATERIAL MACHINE. The VL2000 coinjection molding machine is the
largest of its kind ever shipped by Milacron. Two injection units feed into
a manifold that directs and meters the two different melts. Injection
capacity of each unit is 232 oz. Either or both of the injection units can
be backed out of the manifold for independent purging. The manifold can
also be independently purged. Both the units and the entire molding process
are integrally controlled by the Milacron Camac 486 Plus control system. In
operation, a pin in the manifold moves to open path A, path B, or both
paths together. The control system integrates simultaneous operation of the
two injection units. In most cases conventional molds can be used with no
modification. The operation is essentially an encapsulation process.
Separate core and skin layers can be molded. The skin layer of virgin,
transparent, or other resin types is injected first. Next, the core resin
follows the skin resin, pushing the skin out in front of it. The core resin
can consist of regrind, post-consumer reclaim, or a structural material. A
small finishing amount of skin resin is injected after the core to seal the
gate and complete the encapsulation. Cincinnati Milacron, 4165 Halfacre
Road, Batavia, OH 45103

VERSATILE STAMPING SYSTEMS ENHANCE USER CAPABILITIES

By:
Martin O'Neill, with Jennifer Gordon


   The growing sophistication of control systems on hot-stamping machines
improves the accuracy and versatility of the process. The use of
micro-processor-based systems assures reliable digital control of key
functions. This allows for more consistent decorating, improved
trouble-shooting, and less downtime. Touch-button access on many units also
displays messages of machine functions.
   20 Examples include equipment from Acromark, Berkeley Heights, NJ, that
focuses on exterior marking of cylindrical and tapered parts, and features
improved marking speed, repeatability and safety. Its line of direct-acting
presses ranges from 1/2 to 20-ton force, with die areas from 4 in. by 5 in.
to 24 in. by 36 in. Model 730RR variants include automatic loading and
unloading, plus double-sided versions with double silicone rollers to
increase output speed to close to 60 parts/min. Applications include foil
or preprinted heat transfer decoration of cosmetics containers, canisters,
and bracelets.
   Cassco Machines, Don Mills, ON, Canada, offers a system controller as
standard, allowing operation with turntables, slide tables, peripheral
roll-on attachments, foil strip delays, and pick-and-place units. Control
extends to a dual-speed heat-transfer indexing system for multi-color image
application in a single operation. High-speed, automated systems range in
use from a 1/4-ton hand-fed application to an 18-ton automated factory
press.
   Kensol/Franklin Hot Stamping Machines, Norwood, MA, assembles
hot-stamping machines and makes foils, dies, and tooling at three U.S.
facilities. The KF Model 500 1/2-ton air-operated press features a
user-friendly microprocessor control system, micrometer depth-stop control,
and dual-hardened steel head guides, in ball bearings, suitable for
silicone rubber dies and rugged enough to stamp with metal engraved dies.
   Meanwhile, Air Hydraulics Decorating Systems, St. Louis, MO, offers a
standard line of heat-transfer and foil machinery including horizontal and
vertical roll-ons. The horizontal Accu-Roll is used to apply large heat
transfers while eliminating air entrapment and foil wrinkling. Standard
features include a non-contact infrared temperature sensor, overheating
protection circuit, and variable carriage speed up to 4 in./sec. A coaxial
air/hydraulic cylinder carriage drive with left to right stroke motion
supplies stroke lengths ranging from 15 to 27 in.
   Baier, Rudersberg, Germany, makes both direct-imprint hot stamping
equipment and label-stamping with die-cutting machines for label
production. The company's Geba 1/PPP is adapted to the plastics-processing
industry, with three heads mounted at different angles to stamp various
parts in one operation.
   Cosmetics containers and closures demand refined, fashionable colors,
and eye-catching matte or high-gloss effects to produce an elegant image
and add value to products. Baier developed its new Geba 60 model for
hot-stamping round, oval, and conical shapes. Advantages include fast
tooling changeover for dies and holders, and economic small-run
capabilities. For larger quantities, the machine can be equipped with a
magazine feed system. Capabilities include line or motif stamping, or both
combined.

Equipment is specialized to meet diverse needs
   Because of its cost advantage and durability, hot-stamping is
increasingly used for storage boxes. Hydraulic and hydro-pneumatic machines
are most suited to this application. Baier's model Geba 4/HY has a stamping
pressure of 15 tons. The movement of the plunger is dependent not on
distance, but on pressure, allowing differences in material thickness to be
overcome. Throat and insertion height allow the processing of voluminous
parts.
   Kurz, Furth, Germany, has an in-mold decoration (IMD) technique,
combining injection and hot-stamping of multi-dimensional, flat, or curved
thermoplastics parts for automotive components, cosmetics containers,
electronic equipment casings, domestic appliances, watch faces, picture
frames, door blinds, and nameplates. Foils are fed through a custom-built
injection molding tool.
   During resin injection, pressure and heat from the material cause
release of lacquer layers from the polyester carrier, which bond to the
part providing good chemical and scratch resistance. The thickness of the
polyester carrier depends on decoration depth, part size, injection
position point, and the material being processed. The spent polyester is
wound off. Kurz claims this technique reduces costs by 10 to 50%.
   20 Maple Roll Leaf Co. Ltd., Windsor, ON, Canada, manufactures
pigmented stampings for use in automotive, appliance, cosmetic, or
pharmaceutical industries. The company says bright colors can be applied to
dark substrates.
   Stamp-Rite, Lansing, MI, manufactures steel hot-stamping dies for long
runs. Dies can be surface ground several times with no measurable change in
the stroke of characters. The manufacturing process forms raised characters
on the die while it is in the hardened condition, reducing distortion or
shrinkage possibilities.
   Transfer Print Foils, Inc., East Brunswick, NJ, claims to provide a wide
selection of hot-stamping foils and laminates for decorating plastics.
Customization of printed foils is available for such items as home
furnishings, profiles, and appliances. Decorated laminates in roll or sheet
stock are 2-ply and 3-ply, from 0.020 gage to 0.187 gage. The company says
laminates are available on ABS, PVC, PC, styrene and acrylic.
   United Silicone, Lancaster, NY, provides hot-stamping systems, tooling,
and services. The 2-1/2-ton Model US 25 applies foil or heat transfers to
flat or slightly flat crowned surfaces, and up to 90 deg. of a cylindrical
part's circumference. The US 25's foil-advance system is
electric-motor-driven and produces constant pulling torque for smooth
advance. The system features a foil-tensioning arm, which automatically
removes slack from the foil to eliminate wrinkling. Adjustable foil guide
bars and guide rings provide flexibility and ease of adjustment without any
tools.

HYDROGEN FLUORIDE IS CUT FROM COMPOUNDING PROCESS
ACID SCAVENGER ADDITIVES NUKE (NEUTRALIZE) NOXIOUS FUMES

By:
GAIL S. NONNEMACHER AND DR. STEPHEN I. FOSTER
Edited by William A. Kaplan

   Hydrogen fluoride earns the highest hazard rating given by the U.S.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration for dangerous materials in
the workplace. Even in low concentrations its effects can still cause
significant health problems. We have found that HF can be released from
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) micropowders during compounding, and reach
impermissible levels capable of causing physical injury to workers. The use
of acid scavengers has been found to be highly effective in eliminating the
presence of this hazardous substance.
20 While studying the compounding of micronized PTFE (also termed
micropowders) in general-purpose polystyrene (GPPS), we encountered an
acrid odor. Although ventilation was used to mitigate the odor, it
persisted, especially in the vapor space of confined packages of the
micropowder and the concentrate. Our micropowder supplier thought the odor
originated from residual mineral oil used as a lubricant in its processing
operation and could be controlled by ventilation. This explanation did not
satisfy us and we discovered, surprisingly, the odor was HF. Although HF
can be liberated when PTFE decomposes at approximately 600 degrees F., this
is well above the processing temperature used in our study.
20 During the next compounding run, measurements at the vent port and die
face of the extruder as well as in the vapor space of the gaylords showed
HF concentrations well above 20 p.p.m. HF was also detected in the extruder
hoppers, which fed the concentrate for subsequent processing. The
concentration of HF in air was measured using a Sensidyne Model 800 pump
with hydrogen fluoride detector tubes. The estimates of HF concentration
depend on the degree of color change in the detector tube and the amount of
air drawn through the tube, and can be used to measure HF from 0.25 to 50
p.p.m. However, no HF could be detected outside the gaylords or the plastic
liner, or at a distance of greater than 4 ft. from the compounding
extruder.
   Micronized PTFE is normally prepared from virgin or scrap PTFE resin of
either the fine powder or granular variety. In producing micronized powder,
the PTFE is first coarsely ground and is then subjected to either electron
or gamma irradiation to reduce the molecular weight of the polymer. In
lowering the molecular weight, the PTFE becomes more crystalline; hence,
friable and grindable. The particle size can then be further reduced to
approximately 1 micron by air-impact grinding.

MW reduction process is a factor
   This processing sequence was followed by our micropowder supplier. From
discussions with PTFE industry experts, we learned that during the
irradiation process, the molecular weight of the PTFE is significantly
reduced from the 2- to 5-million range to approximately 200,000. This is
accomplished by breaking the carbon-carbon bond along the PTFE chains, a
process which creates many free radical species where the chains are
terminated. These reactive free radicals can combine with oxygen and/or
water from the air to form stable organic acids and acid fluorides. The
acid fluorides can further react with water to form organic acids,
liberating HF gas. Higher temperatures accelerate the liberation of HF.
Thus, when the micropowder is compounded, HF is liberated and slowly
diffuses out of the concentrate.
20 For example, one sample of the concentrate made during our study that
contained 20% PTFE was analyzed to determine the amount of hydrolyzible
fluoride, i.e., potentially releasable HF. The results indicate that the
pellets contained 5 p.p.m. hydrolyzible fluoride, which was assumed to be
available as HF. Assuming that a gaylord contains 1000 lb. of 20%
concentrate and that HF is an ideal gas, we calculated that, if all the HF
were instantaneously released, about 3000 p.p.m. could be found in the
vapor space of the gaylord. This calculation indicated that while the
amount of releasable HF in the pellet was small, there is enough
hydrolyzible fluoride in the concentrate to account for the HF measured in
the vapor space of the gaylords. The difference between the calculated and
actual amounts of HF in a gaylord is probably due to diffusion-limited
release of HF from the pellets.
20 We conjectured that HF generation during compounding was aggravated
due to the high melt temperatures that were employed, which ranged from 500
to 550 degrees F. Reduction of heating setpoints and throughput yielded a
lower melt temperature of 490 degrees F., but did not significantly impact
the generation of HF. We also hypothesized that pre-baking the PTFE
micropowder prior to compounding might reduce or remove much of the HF.
Several types of baked and unbaked, high and low irradiation PTFE were
obtained from our micropowder supplier and were compounded using our normal
extrusion temperatures, i.e., 500 to 550 degrees F. However, the level of
HF generated from the baked and unbaked samples was far in excess of
industrial hygiene limits.

Potential scavengers selected
   Based on the chemistry involved and our calculations indicating that the
concentration of HF in the pellets was exceedingly small, the use of an
acid scavenger represented a realistic approach to solving this problem.
Similarly, the suspected role of free radical chemistry in the production
of HF suggested that antioxidants, which scavenge free radicals, might also
be useful in solving this problem.
20 Acid scavenger candidates were: calcium stearate powders, DHT-4A (Mg
subscript 4.5 Al sbuscript 2 (OH) subscript 13 CO subscript3 .3 .5 H
subscript 2 O), and magnesium oxide powder. The calcium stearate and
magnesium oxide were pre-compounded into GPPS resin. Irganox B225 (from
Ciba-Geigy), an anti-oxidant, was also investigated, since it might react
with the PTFE chain ends to form a stable, non-reactive chain.
20 Blends of the 20% PTFE/80% GPPS concentrate and the potential
scavengers were re-compounded using typical operating conditions. (Table 1)
Potential scavengers were initially evaluated at loadings of 1% to provide
excess scavenger based on the measured level of hydrolyzible fluoride and
the reaction stoichiometry. The residual HF level was measured by
collecting a 7- to 10-lb. sample of the concentrate in a 60-liter PE bag,
sealing the bag for five minutes, and then measuring the HF evolved in the
air space. Upon discovery of a scavenger that resulted in a non-detectable
level of HF, the level of scavenger was halved and the experiment was
repeated. The lowest scavenger level investigated was 0.20%. (Table 2)
   Additional evaluation of successful scavengers considered their
hydroscopic nature and the expected likelihood to agglomerate. Also, to
confirm that enough scavenger remained to prevent HF formation during
additional processing steps, the preferred acid scavenger was initially
compounded at a level of 0.25% into the concentrate and the resulting
concentrate was re-compounded two times.
   Calcium stearate, DHT-4A, and magnesium oxide were determined to be
effective acid scavengers at 0.25 weight percent in the production of 20%
PTFE in GPPS concentrate. Irganox B225 was not effective at the levels
tested. Based on these results, calcium stearate was selected as the least
hydroscopic and having the smallest probability of agglomeration due to its
lower melting temperature and fine particle size. Re-compounding this
material two times produced no detectable HF after subsequent passes. Thus,
calcium stearate was incorporated into the production of the concentrate at
our contract compounder. No HF could be detected in the concentrate
produced, in sealed containers of the concentrate, or in any area of the
facility. Industrial hygiene monitoring has since been routinely conducted
and has failed to detect any HF.
20 It is reasonable to assume that the calcium stearate reacts with the
HF or HF-precursor to produce calcium fluoride (CaF2) and stearic acid.
Both of these reaction products are considered innocuous materials from an
industrial hygiene and reactivity standpoint, particularly at these low
concentrations. Stearic acid is known to act as a processing aid but at
these low levels it did not appear to impact extrusion conditions.
   This information may be useful to other processors, but it is important
to verify that acid scavengers will work in a particular system by
monitoring the level of HF in various areas.

RELATIVE STABILITY IN SUPPLY AND PRICING IS PROJECTED FOR MARKET

By:
Joseph A. Grande

   After a blockbuster 1994, demand for polystyrene eased to what many term
realistic levels in 1995. The market took off early in the year but fizzled
by mid-summer, as inventories soared, prices rose before settling in the
fourth quarter, and demand softened.
   In North America, demand dropped slightly. U.S. production of PS
declined by 0.9%, according to the Society of the Plastics Industry, while
sales and captive use were off by 2.6% over 1994.
   Western Europe and Japan were relatively flat as well. A bright spot in
Europe was expandable PS, which posted a 4% gain from demand for building
insulation in eastern Germany.
   The Far East enjoyed strong growth despite tight import restrictions in
China.
   Throughout the decade, PS should grow by 3 to 4% annually, says Edward
Glatzer, principal with consultant Chem Systems Inc., Tarrytown, NY, which
recently completed a study of the styrenics business. Glatzer said the
modest gains are attributed to more mature markets in North America and
Europe and the loss of export business in Japan to offshore companies.
Surging economies in the Far East, particularly China and India, will yield
double-digit growth in those areas.
   Suppliers see ample availability of feedstocks this year. Costs,
moreover, seem to have settled. Though prices rose through the summer in
North America and Europe, they have dropped 20 to 25%. Fewer imports into
China forced prices in the Far East to drop during the summer, says Karl
Foerster, PS market manager for BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany.
   Market-wise, in the U.S., observers agree that polystyrene is under less
pressure for material substitution. ``The easy substitutions by
polypropylene have been done; it's a lot slower than 3 or 4 years ago,''
said Marvin Sauers, PS business manager for Amoco Polymers, Alpharetta,
GA.
   In Europe, some volatility is possible, particularly in packaging
applications, because of the price gap between PP and PS (DM 0.90 to 1.20
for PP versus DM 1.60 for PS), says Bruno Barbet, product manager for Dow
Europe, Horgen, Switzerland.
   In North America and Europe, high-impact PS continues to penetrate the
business equipment market. As a less costly alternative to lower ABS and
PC/ABS, polystyrene finds growing use in keyboards, monitors, and housings
due to lower mechanical and thermal requirements.
   In 1995, polystyrene completed its virtual replacement of ABS in 3.5-in.
micro floppy disks, according to Richard Marchetti, director of market
development for Huntsman Chemical Co., Chesapeake, VA.
   Oriented PS, meanwhile, is making strides in rigid food packaging.
Grades with lower residual monomer don't affect the taste of packaged
goods.
   BASF, Mt. Olive, NJ, will unveil this year high-impact,
ultraviolet-light-stable grades that compete with PC/ABS in computer
housings. Under development are high-impact, high-gloss specialty grades
with 20% better melt flow, equivalent gloss, and improved impact compared
to the company's workhorse grade ES 9524. The materials would compete with
medium-impact ABS in small appliances and other consumer durables.
   There's not much expansion planned in the West this year, though BASF is
adding capacity in Mexico and the U.S., and Novacor, Leominster, MA, is
starting up 70 million lb. in Springfield, MA.
   Far East suppliers continue to build capacity, however, in response to
strong demand.
   One project made Zhanjiang Zhongmei Chemical Industries Co., Guangdong
Province, China's largest PS producer, when it added a second
88-million-lb./yr. line last year. The company is a Sino-American joint
venture, 70% owned by American Pacific Enterprises Group, Los Angeles, CA.

BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS OFFER TAILORED RATES OF DEGRADATION

By:
EDITED BY ROBERT D. LEAVERSUCH

   A number of biodegradable polymers have been developed that provide
precision-controlled degradation. These polymers are considered to be a
viable approach to plastics waste disposal in selected end-uses. They
include:
   -- Polyester amide is said to compost without residue at a rate
comparable to lettuce leaves. The semi-crystalline yet translucent material
resists solvents and light, has a melting point of 125C., and works in film
and fiber extrusion, and molding. Potential applications are garbage bags,
disposable flower pots, and mulch sheet. Bayer AG, Bayerwerk, D-51368,
Leverkusen, Germany
   -- Starch-based thermoplastic made from cereal feedstocks has
antistatic properties. The basic structure is comprised of copolyesters. A
plasticizer is blended on-line with the copolyester to form an antistatic
biodegradable material. Household and packaging films display toughness and
good elongation at break. BASF, Carl-Bosche Straabe 38, D-67056
Ludwigshafen, Germany
   -- Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) stays flexible from sub-zero to 130C.
temperatures, and biodegrades in a few months. The thermoplastic polyester
is a joint development of Biomer (a manufacturer of biodegradables) and PCD
Polymere, the European polyolefin supplier. Injection molding grades with
properties comparable to PS and PP run on conventional equipment. machines.
PCD Polymere, Danubiastrabe 21-25, A-2323, Schwechat-Mannsworth, Germany
   -- Aliphatic polyester works in PE, PP, and PS. Bionolle processes on
conventional processing equipment at 140 to 260 degrees C., in blown and
extruded films, foams, and injection molded products. Application areas are
paper lamination, trash bags, diapers, and cosmetic and beverage bottles.
Showa Highpolymer Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan
   -- Aliphatic polyester that biodegrades in soil as well as fresh and
ocean water areas, decomposes to water and carbon dioxide. Skygreen's rate
of degradation depends on grade, product shape, and level of
microbiological activity. Typically, degradation of a 40-mil-thick film
takes two months. Odorless material has properties similar to those of PE
and PP and can be readily processed on conventional equipment. Sunkyong
Industries Ltd., Kukdong Bldg., Choogmuro, Jung-Gu, Seoul 100-705, South

PBT MAKES A CLEAN SWEEP

   Thermoplastic polyesters allow the redesign of vacuum cleaner motors by
the Electrolux Group, Luton, U.K., yielding cost-performance benefits. The
motor's one-component, input air guide is molded from polybutylene
terephthalate, providing a smooth surface (for reduced turbulence) and
parts consolidation. The part had been a 10-component, stamped-metal
system. The air guide snapfits to a PET (Rynite 530) housing, eliminating
mechanical attachments. System cost is cut by less materials use and
simplified manufacturing. DuPont Engineering Polymers, P.O. Box 80713,

POLYETHERIMIDE RESINS

   POLYETHERIMIDE RESINS are said to improve processability and to optimize
the balance of heat and impact properties. Ultem HTX is targeted at
replacing stainless steel or high-performance polymers in medical and food
service markets. Notched Izod impact strength is 500% higher than a
standard polyetherimide grade. The new grade also features improved
chemical resistance for medically sterilizable applications. Ultem ATX is a
next-generation PEI/PC blend providing high impact strength, intermediate
thermals, and reduced cost. Unreinforced, the heat-distortion temperature
is 165 degrees C to 190 degrees C. Resin is for food-service applications
(microwaveable cookware, utensils), and also has potential in automotive
headlamp reflectors (it can be metallized without costly basecoat
procedures). GE Plastics, One Plastics Ave., Pittsfield, MA 01201

THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN 

THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN dragged on this week, with 
congressional and White House negotiators still exchanging 
philosophical barbs on Wednesday, Jan. 3, but offering no 
real retreat from hard-line positions for public view.  The 
Wall Street Journal summarized:  "Success is not at hand."  
The EPA parking lot was at least half full, however, begging 
the question as to whether a plethora of regulations and 
proposals would drop into the hopper once the government 
reopens.  More than a handful of "non-essential" workers were 
sneaking into their offices anyway.  Unlike past involuntary 
"furloughs," questions were raised as to whether employees 
would get their paychecks, half a paycheck or none at all.  
The questions were even more pressing for government 
contractors, who were looking at the possibility of layoffs.

DELANEY CLAUSE 

DELANEY CLAUSE decisions by EPA's OPPTS were among the key 
matters left hanging by the government shutdown.  EPA must 
decide whether to cancel some pesticide tolerances because 
of the anti-cancer provision of the law and whether to apply 
the clause to dried agricultural products under a definition 
which considers drying to be "processing."

A CHEMICAL SPILL 

A CHEMICAL SPILL in Bogalusa, La., in October is attracting 
dozens of lawyers, according to a Jan. 2 Fox-TV presentation 
"A Current Affair," with 50 cases already filed.  
Prominently featured was Johnnie Cochran of O.J. Simpson 
case notoriety, who accused EPA and the community of 
negligence in their emergency plan and said "somebody is 
going to be held responsible" (See Dec. 6, Page 2).  Gaylord 
Chemical Corp., the company involved in the freight train 
spill of nitrogen tetraoxide, was said to be holding

UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS 

UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS are unlikely to be the cause of 
elevated breast cancer mortality rates in the Northeast, two 
Maryland epidemiologists wrote in the Dec. 20 Journal of the 
National Cancer Institute.  "Further reassurance is provided 
by the near absence of regional differences among younger 
women, plus the convergence of breast cancer rates across the 
country over time," wrote William Blot and Joseph McLaughlin 
of the International Epidemiology Institute in Rockville, Md.  
Their conclusion was based on an NCI statistical analysis of 
the regional distribution of breast cancer mortality in 1987.  
More research is needed to determine the role of genetic 
and/or environmental factors in breast cancer development, 
they said.

MONSANTO's ROUNDUP 

MONSANTO's ROUNDUP was noted in the Jan. 2 Wall Street 
Journal as having continued success and even dominance, 
despite the growth of competition.  The journal said 
Monsanto plans to introduce "Roundup-ready" soybean seeds 
for plants resistant to the herbicide during the 1996 spring 
planting season.  It was also noted that the firm 
aggressively cut prices during 1995.

TRICHLORFON, AN ORGANOPHOSPHORUS INSECTICIDE, 

TRICHLORFON, AN ORGANOPHOSPHORUS INSECTICIDE, has been 
suggested as the cause of such congenital abnormalities as 
Down's Syndrome among a small Hungarian population who ate 
fish contaminated with the substance in the late 1980s, said 
researcher Andrew Czetzel of the World Health Organization 
in a letter to the editor in the January 1996 issue of 
Epidemiology.  According to Czetzel, of 15 births in a small 
village in Hungary in 1989-90, 11, or 73%, were affected by 
congenital abnormalities.  Several of the women who gave 
birth had consumed fish contaminated with 100 mg per kg of 
dichlorvos, which is slowly released in fish treated with 
trichlorfon, he said.  In the study, researchers ruled out 
teratologic factors, familial inheritance and consanguinity.  
Czetzel added that the cluster ceased when the chemical 
treatment of farmed fish with trichlorfon was banned in 
March 1991.

METHYL BROMIDE AND PENTACHLOROPHENOL STUDIES 

METHYL BROMIDE AND PENTACHLOROPHENOL STUDIES by the 
California EPA Department of Pesticide Regulation are not 
yet complete, and giving manufacturers additional time to 
complete them "is a question of process and fairness, not a 
health and safety issue," said department director James 
Wells.  Wells said that California Gov. Pete Wilson Dec. 29 
called a special legislative session to consider legislation 
in the state that would allow DPR to grant manufacturers of 
the two pesticides additional time to complete the last of 
several required toxicology studies.

EPA FACING MANDAMUS WRIT REQUEST ON SEWER GROUT

EPA is faced with an inability to answer as the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the District of Columbia considers a request 
for a writ of mandamus to compel an agency response on its 
proposed ban of acrylamide sewer grout (See Oct. 25, Page 
9).

The court on Dec. 14 upheld a mandamus request from the 
National Association of Sewer Service Companies, ordering an 
EPA response within 21 days to a NASSCO demand for an EPA 
answer.  EPA then filed a request for additional time, citing 
the furlough imposed by the government's budget impasse.

NASSCO attorneys Lynn Bergeson and Lisa Campbell opposed the 
extension in a Dec. 22 briefing that traced the chronology 
of the proposal and argued that EPA has had plenty of time.  
Among the statements by the attorneys for Weinberg, Bergeson 
& Neuman were:

-- "EPA issued the proposed rule at issue over four years 
ago.  The proposed rule seeks to abate human health risks 
that, despite the passage of time, EPA continues to 
characterize as 'unreasonable.'  These human health risks 
are apparently not unreasonable enough for EPA to take 
action, however.

-- "The Office of Management and Budget rejected the draft 
final rule and returned it to EPA on Oct. 18, 1995.  EPA 
informed NASSCO on Oct. 30, 1995, that it would not be 
withdrawing the rule by the end of October, nor would EPA 
commit to withdrawing the rule at any time in the future.  
Within 24 hours of being so advised, NASSCO submitted the 
petition on Nov. 1, 1995.

-- "Respondent (EPA) was served with the petition by first 
class mail on Nov. 1, 1995, a full seven weeks ago.  
Counsel for respondent, Jon Lipschultz, called on or about 
Nov. 15, 1995, five weeks ago, to state that he had 
received the petition and would be working on it.  Indeed, 
NASSCO notified EPA that it intended to bring court action 
to compel the issuance or withdrawal of the proposed rule 
last summer, long before respondent was actually served 
with the petition on Nov. 1, 1995.  

-- "Respondent's claim for the need for time beginning with 
the court's Dec. 14, 1995, order thus inaccurately reflects 
the amount of time that respondent has had to work on its 
response to the petition....




-- "Respondent claims that the current furlough of federal 
workers affects it ability to prepare its response.  As 
stated above, respondent had ample time before the court's 
order was issued and before the furlough commenced to 
prepare its response to the petition...."

NASSCO  concluded that "every day of continued delay in the 
issuance or withdrawal of the proposed ban harms NASSCO 
members." ((6PTCN 1002, 8 pages, $6)

INDUSTRY CALLS PROPOSED WPS DECONTAMINATION CHANGES TOO 
COSTLY

EPA's proposed modifications to Worker Protection Standard 
decontamination rules would place an economic hardship on 
growers, industry groups and trade associations said in 
comments submitted to the agency.  

Requiring decontamination facilities even after a crop has 
been harvested would be "an unjust and unduly burdensome 
economic expense to the producer," the Coalition for 
Sensible Farmworker Protection said.  

EPA published proposed WPS decontamination changes in the 
Sept. 29 Federal Register (See Aug. 23, Page 2; Sept. 27, 
Page 19).  The agency proposed to shorten the amount of time 
in which growers must provide decontamination facilities to 
between one and 15 days for most pesticides.

It would cost $4,400 to provide decontamination sites for 
1,000 acres, the coalition said, criticizing EPA's estimate 
of compliance costs as "quite low."  

"[T]he undersigned organizations continue to believe that it 
is inappropriate for the agency to require decontamination 
facilities at the end of the restricted entry interval," the 
coalition said.  The group includes state departments of 
agriculture, university agriculture departments and several 
trade associations.  Decontamination facilities should be 
required only when workers are present and have contact with 
pesticide-treated surfaces, it said.   

The coalition also criticized EPA's proposal to require 
decontamination sites for pesticides with REIs longer than 
four hours.  Such determinations should be based on a risk-
based, sound science standard, not solely on length of 
exposure, it said.

The Yuma (Ariz.) Vegetable Shippers Association also said it 
would be expensive for growers to comply with the proposed 
decontamination requirements.

The Society of American Florists asked EPA to apply the 
proposal to all pesticides, instead of only to those with 
REIs of four hours or longer.

In its comments, the American Farm Bureau Federation 
proposed a zero-day decontamination period for all 
pesticides with REIs less than four hours.  A zero-day 
decontamination requirement for these pesticides would 
encourage the use of low-toxicity pesticides, it said.  
"This makes lower-risk products more cost competitive."  
Like the Coalition for Sensible Farmworker Protection, the 
federation called the cost of decontamination kits 
"significant."

The federation also asked EPA to:

-- "eliminate the requirement for a decontamination site 
after crops are harvested; 

-- "eliminate the decontamination requirement when the REIs 
expire, and

-- "allow field workers to bring decontamination kits into 
treated areas as early entry.  EPA should allow growers to 
make similar arrangements for provision of decontamination 
kits for all types of agricultural workers."

The Georgia Department of Agriculture asked EPA to simplify 
the proposed changes by limiting the number of exceptions to 
the WPS.  "[T]here are already too many 'if/then' statements 
or exceptions....  Regulations that are simple, easily 
comprehended and have few exceptions are more likely to be 
followed....  More exceptions usually mean more complexity 
and the more likely the regulated community is to be 
confused, which adversely affects enforcement," it said.  
GDA proposed a seven-day decontamination site requirement 
after the REI expires.

Columbia, Md., resident Louis True Jr., a former EPA 
official, said EPA failed to indicate why the agency plans 
to depart from its 1992 WPS regulations.  He asked the 
agency to repropose a WPS standard instead of modifying the 
current one.  "Absent such a step, there will have been no 
reasonable opportunity for public comment on a rational 
presentation of the basis for the proposed changes, and any 
conclusions drawn by EPA would be arbitrary and capricious," 
he said.

The WPS changes EPA seeks can be achieved by a case-by-case 
review of labeling requirements rather than revising the 
1992 regulation, he said.  ((6PTCN 1001, 24 pages, $10)

EPA, HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS ARGUE OVER TIMING ISSUES

Arguments over minute details, particularly concerning 
timing, continued in the EPA FIFRA case against Health Care 
Products as EPA filed -- just before the furlough clamped 
down on the government -- an extensive brief with the Office 
of Administrative Law Judges (See Dec. 6, Page 20).

EPA noted its earlier request to have the hearing proceed 
under the name Smartel Communications instead of Celltech 
Media or Health Care Products, noting that ALJ Daniel Head 
had not allowed the filing and had ordered a schedule of 
motions from both parties.

Following the end of a first furlough last November, EPA 
said, attempts were made to contact Health Care Products 
attorney James Piccozi to set up the schedule, but to no 
avail.  EPA's problems with the later and current furlough 
were described in the agency's brief:

-- "Judge Head's Nov. 14, 1995, order, which was filed 
following a feverish and pointedly irregular flurry of 
telephonic and letter writing attempts by counsel for 
petitioner/respondent to circumvent established agency 
procedures, clearly set forth the mechanism by which 
petitioner/respondent's requests for any schedule changes 
were to be decided.

-- "In anticipation of federal shutdown which loomed and 
which in fact occurred on the very day that the judge issued 
his order, Judge Head directed that the parties consult with 
one another concerning the schedule and any alternative 
dates to be set immediately following the end of the federal 
shutdown.  It was clear from the judge's order that no 
responses to pending motions should be filed during the time 
period between the judge's order and the reopening of the 
federal government and the parties' taking the steps ordered 
by the judge.

-- "In flagrant disregard of the judge's Nov. 19, 1995, fax-
served order, on Nov. 19, 1995, petitioner/respondent 
dispatched its response to the Oct. 23, 1995, motion.  It 
did so even with the knowledge that complainant/respondent 
intended to file an amendment to its motion and could not do 
so at the time of the still-crippling federal shutdown....

-- "Petitioner/respondent appears to have attempted to 
exploit the absence of counsel for complainant/respondent 
and their inability to take any actions in this litigation 
to its unfair advantage.  It filed a document which was 
affected by the judge's order and which it should have known 
should have only been filed following the ordered 
consultation with counsel for the agency and the parties' 
subsequent report to the judge."

The brief pointed out that in addition to the controversy 
over use of the name "Smartel Communications," Piccozi had 
raised an issue as to whether the company should be called 
"Health Care Products" or "Health Care Products, Inc."  
Accusing Piccozi of demanding changes in EPA's work 
schedule, agency counsel Philip Ross, Bret Williams, Carl 
Eichenwald, Davina Pujari and Scott Garrison complained:  
"... Counsel for petitioner/respondent seems to think that 
the agency should 'drop everything' to meet the needs and 
convenience of complainant/respondent and its counsel.  
Though counsel for complainant/respondent may have 
difficulty realizing that the agency has other matters to 
which it must attend other than business that pertains to 
his client, such is indeed the case."

30, 1995, with the expiration date extended to Oct. 31, 
1995, in Oregon and June 22, 1996, in Florida.  The 
exemptions were granted to the Delaware Department of 
Agriculture; Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer 
Services; Georgia Department of Agriculture; Maine 
Department of Agriculture; Maryland Department of 
Agriculture; Michigan Department of Agriculture; Minnesota 
Department of Agriculture; New Jersey Department of 
Environmental Protection; New York Department of 
Environmental Conservation; North Dakota Department of 
Agriculture; Ohio Department of Agriculture; Oregon 
Department of Agriculture; Pennsylvania Department of 
Agriculture; South Dakota Department of Agriculture; 
Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, 
and Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer 
Services.

The agency also noted that the Montana Department of 
Agriculture initiated a crisis exemption July 15 for the use 
of bifenthrin on canola to control diamondback moth larvae.  
This program has ended.

In the same notice, EPA denied specific exemption requests 
from the California Department of Pesticide Regulations for 
the use of fenpropathrin on tomatoes to control silverleaf 
and greenhouse whiteflies; the Montana Department of 
Agriculture for the use of tralkoxydim on wheat to control 
weeds since the situation is "routine and not urgent," and 
to the Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota Departments 
of Agriculture for the use of propiconazole on wheat and 
barley to control fusarium head blight because residue 
chemistry indicated the crops would contain carcinogenic 
residue in processed foods, triggering the Delaney "anti-
cancer" clause.  

The agency also denied specific exemption requests for use 
of Pirate on cotton to control beet armyworms since it is 
unregistered due to "risk of unreasonable adverse effects to 
nontarget birds, aquatic organisms and the environment."  
EPA added that an exemption for a registered alternative, 
tebufenozide, was granted to control the pest in the 
Southeastern Cotton Belt region.  Exemption requests were 
denied to:

Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries; Arkansas 
State Plant Board; Georgia Department of Agriculture; 
Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry; 
Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce, and 
Tennessee Department of Agriculture.

INDUSTRY, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS DISAGREE ON IMPACT OF TAKINGS 
BILL

A broadly worded bill in the Senate that would compensate 
property owners and businesses adversely affected by federal 
regulation is drawing widely different reactions from 
environmental and business groups. 

The so-called takings bill could weaken pesticide 
regulations by making it prohibitively expensive for the 
government to impose usage restrictions, environmentalists 
said.  Business groups said the measure would give growers 
and landowners much-needed regulatory relief.  Either way, 
both agreed it could have a far-reaching impact on pesticide 
regulation.

Both the Senate and the House are working on so-called 
takings bills.  But while the House bill targets wetlands, 
endangered species and water use, the Senate version, 
recently approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
contains broad language that could subject any regulatory 
agency to takings claims from private citizens, according to 
environmentalists. 

"Some restriction on the application of a particular 
pesticide that has the effect of reducing the yield of the 
land and therefore the short-term or long-term real estate 
values could be a taking under the definition of takings in 
this bill," said John Echeverr, general counsel for the 
National Audubon Society.  "As written, S 605 is 
extraordinarily broad and applies to any type of 
governmental regulation under any federal law," he said.

"The one exception to the bill is that if an activity 
constitutes a nuisance, then regulation on the activity does 
not constitute a taking.  But pesticide application as a 
nuisance generally doesn't have strong roots in common law," 
Echeverr said.

Agricultural Groups Support Bill's Implications

Jim Egenrieder, director of regulatory affairs for the 
Agricultural Retailers Association, said his group supports 
the broader implications of the takings bill.  "The growers 
are prohibited from using certain materials in certain areas 
without any recognition of the financial impact of some of 
those initiatives, and without going through any cost-
benefit analysis," said Egenrieder.  "I think this takings 
legislation is asking 'Should a person be compensated when 
he or she can no longer use that land because of regulatory 
or legislative action?'"

Floyd Gaibler, vice president of governmental affairs for the 
Agricultural Retailers Association, said a broad group of 15 
agricultural associations and companies signed a Dec. 5 
letter supporting the bill.  "We say it would clarify the 
takings standards that courts have not been able to clearly 
articulate," said Gaibler. 

The letter says, "The agriculture community increasingly is 
impacted by regulations which prohibit ordinary land uses 
just as effectively as if a highway were built across 
private land."  The letter goes on to say that farms are 
often collateral for operating loans, and that the 
accumulated value of land is often a landowner's primary 
source of retirement income.

Sierra Club Calls Measure Anti-environmental

The Senate takings bill "is a radical anti-environmental 
bill," said Roni Lieberman, media director for the Sierra 
Club.  "The bill distorts the meaning of American property 
rights.  In the case of pesticides, corporations could say 
they should be compensated for having to add environmental 
controls to their properties," he continued.

Lieberman also said the bill would subject agencies to 
costly review to determine possible takings effects of new 
regulation.  "This is not about property rights, which are 
protected under the constitution," said Lieberman.  "It is 
about boosting profits," he said.

Clinton Vows to Veto Senate Takings Bill

The Clinton administration charged that the Senate bill 
would create "one of the most expensive new federal spending 
programs in recent history" and block new laws to protect 
public health and safety.  In a Dec. 14 letter to Senate 
Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Clinton 
said he would veto S 605 or any similar legislation.  This 
drew a quick response from Hatch. 

Hatch Says Regulators Would Need to Step Lightly Around 
Property Rights

"President Clinton astonishingly says this bill does not 
protect legitimate private property rights," said Hatch, who 
added that the bill creates a "system of incentives for 
agencies to reduce the number and size of the takings they 
commit." 

Hatch said a Congressional Budget Office report released in 
October suggests that the bill will not burden federal 
regulatory agencies with a lot of takings actions.  "That 
estimate concludes that the bill will have only minimal costs 
and will achieve the stated goals of the bill by encouraging 
agencies to change their behavior," said Hatch, adding that 
the provisions in the bill come out of current case law.  "So 
when we debate this bill, let's remember that many of the 
provisions of the bill are simply codifying what the Supreme 
Court has said the Fifth Amendment requires," he said.

SORGHUM PRODUCERS GROUP CHALLENGES GRANULAR CARBOFURAN 
CANCELLATION

The National Grain Sorghum Producers Association is 
preparing oral arguments in its challenge of EPA's decision 
to cancel sorghum uses for granular carbofuran.  Oral 
arguments in the case are scheduled for Feb. 22 before the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for Washington D.C.

The association said in its Nov. 22 pleading that EPA has 
no basis in the record for its conclusion that granular 
carbofuran poses an unreasonable risk to birds.  It also 
contended that EPA failed to hold a hearing on its final 
decision.

"EPA relied solely on avian mortality as the basis for its 
decision not to allow the continued use of granular 
carbofuran," the association said.  "After more than 10 
years of study, there is no evidence of birds killed by 
granular carbofuran applied in sorghum in accordance with 
its label."

The pleading charges that EPA "misapplied" data allegedly 
supporting its conclusion about avian deaths.  For 
instance, the agency referred to 41 incidents of alleged 
bird kills attributable to direct granular carbofuran 
poisoning, 25 of which were water fowls in rice fields in a 
single area in California, the pleading says, adding that 
this data is not relevant because new agricultural 
practices have eliminated water fowl deaths in rice fields.

EPA also emphasized alleged raptor kills by granular 
carbofuran without strong evidence that reported raptor 
incidents were the result of exposure to the chemical, the 
association argued.

"Not only was the analysis EPA employed deeply flawed, the 
agency ignored studies that did not support its desired 
conclusions," the group said, claiming that EPA ignored 
Maryland and Florida field studies suggesting that granular 
carbofuran, when used properly, did not cause bird deaths.

The association also accused EPA of denying its request for 
a hearing before the pesticide was canceled.  "A trial-type 
hearing would have allowed petitioner to more fully 
demonstrate the lack of evidence supporting cancellation of 
granular carbofuran on sorghum," it said.

The association claimed that cancellation of granular 
carbofuran would cause hardship on farmers who would not be 
able to find an affordable alternative to control chinch 
bugs.  "An alternative to granular carbofuran for 
controlling chinch bugs, flowable carbofuran, is more 
expensive and requires different equipment for 
application," said the pleading, which adds that the 
additional expense of this application equipment is too 
expensive for sorghum producers farming fewer than 250 
acres.  ((6PTCN 1003, 39 pages, $14)

BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL AGENTS  MINOR-USE PROGRAM SOUGHT

Beyond Integrated Pest Management, biological control 
methods development needs much more research, more 
government coordination and a program similar to the minor-
use pesticide development program.  These were major 
recommendations this week of a committee of the National 
Research Council's Food and Nutrition Board.

The report, "Ecologically Based Pest Management -- New 
Solutions for a New Century," was developed by the Food and 
Nutrition Board's Committee on Pest and Pathogen Control 
through Management of Biological Control Agents and Enhanced 
Cycles and Natural Processes, headed by Ralph Hardy of the 
Boyce Thompson Institute, Ithaca, N.Y.

The committee saw an "urgent need for an alternative 
approach to pest management that can complement and 
partially replace current chemically based pest management 
practices."  Noting the introduction of synthetic chemical 
pesticides in the 1940s, the committee said:

"It is now clear that their use has some unfortunate 
consequences.  Many consumers believe that trace residues of 
synthetic chemicals in food are undesirable and represent a 
significant food safety risk.  In some cases, undesirable 
environmental impacts of synthetic pesticides have caused 
consumers to oppose the use of these materials in 
agriculture and caused governments to regulate or outlaw 
their use."

Ecologically based pest management (EBPM) as proposed by the 
committee would go beyond Integrated Pest Management's 
reliance on synthetic controls and "rely primarily on inputs 
of pest biological knowledge and secondarily on physical, 
chemical and biological supplements for pest management."  
The description continued:

-- "The EBPM systems will be built on an underlying knowledge 
of the managed ecosystem, including the natural processes 
that suppress pest populations.  It is based on the 
recognition that many standard agricultural practices 
disrupt natural processes that suppress pests.

-- "In contrast to standard practices that disrupt and 
destabilize the agrosystem, agricultural practices 
recommended by EBPM will augment natural processes.  These 
practices will be supplemented by biological-control 
organisms and products, resistant plants and narrow-spectrum 
pesticides."

As to EBPM's improvement over integrated pest management, 
the committee said:  "Early IPM innovators should be 
recognized for conceiving a framework for an integrated 
approach to arthropod, weed and pathogen pest management....  
The practice of IPM, unfortunately, is not always consistent 
with the theory of IPM.  The focus of early IPM programs was 
devoted to control of insects, setting a precedent for the 
focus of IPM on arthropod pest management.  In many cases, 
this management was limited to pest scouting and precise 
applications of insecticides.  Consequently, this focus has 
been at the expense of IPM of weed and pathogen pests."

The three fundamental goals of EBPM were outlined as:  "(1) 
safety, (2) profitability and (3) durability."

The acute and chronic toxicities associated with synthetics 
generally have not been found with biological-control 
organisms, the committee said, elaborating on the second and 
third goals with:

-- "For EBPM to be successful, it must also be profitable for 
the grower....  Because producers will implement only those 
pest control methods that lower economic risks and enhance 
profits, they will insist on assurances that biologically 
based tools are cost-effective and provide consistent 
responses....

-- "EBPM strategies also must be long-lasting to have a 
positive impact on crop protection....  Decreasing the pest's 
rate of development of resistance to new inputs is essential 
for the durability of EBPM."

Noting a "large annual research and development investment 
of more than $500 million" for the production of organic 
pesticides, the committee said, "... An increased investment 
in research of biological processes will be needed to 
support the development of EBPM."

Monitoring, Certification Seen as Needed

Following an extensive description of biological control 
programs to date, the committee outlined implementation 
steps for EBPM as including:

Small-market support -- "Some of the most effective 
biological-control organisms and products in EBPM are 
projected to have modest uses or small markets, and will 
require public-sector support for regulatory approval as 
well as for research....  [T]he costs associated with 
obtaining registration can discourage commercialization of 
biological-control organisms, as is the case now for minor 
use chemical pesticides, products needed on small acreage or 
in such small markets that they lack commercial appeal.  In 
the same way that public funds help with approval processes 
of minor use chemical pesticides by regulatory agencies, 
public investment can ensure continued progress for 
biological technologies."

Certification -- "Organized efforts to increase distribution 
of high-quality biological tools will facilitate grower 
acceptance of EBPM.  The procedure of crop seed 
certification by state agencies guarantees that new 
cultivars are genetically pure and that noxious weeds, 
arthropods and pathogens are below detection limits.  Each 
certification board tests, increases, releases and 
distributes new field crops according to predetermined 
standards....  Such a process of release benefits the 
individual grower with valuable information on product 
performance and quality, lowering the risk of adoption."

Monitoring pests -- "Monitoring for the potential development 
of resistance by pest organisms is key to managing the long-
term viability of ecologically based systems....  The 
importance of monitoring pest populations in individual 
fields is critical to the accurate assessment of tactics 
aimed at delaying pest resistance to biological control."

Emphasizing the importance of "durability" of biological 
solutions, the committee said it "must be managed through 
collective action" and continued:

-- "An effective mechanism currently used to delay pest 
resistance is the coordination of pest control activities 
among growers (National Audubon Society, 1994); sharing pest 
monitoring activities and collected information is useful in 
developing countermeasures that will limit additional crop 
losses.

-- "Practices, comparable to the use of mixtures and multilines 
to conserve the durability of plant resistance genes, can be 
developed and put into practice in order to enhance the 
durability of valuable biological-control organisms and 
products.  Efforts to do this can be coordinated by industry, 
perhaps modeled on such organizations as the fungicide 
resistance working group, which is dedicated towards 
developing practices and implementation recommendations to 
enhance the long-term use of fungicides.  Cooperative efforts 
among researchers, industrial suppliers and growers can 
increase the durability of these biological tools."

Gaps and Inconsistencies in Public Oversight Listed

After devoting 19 small-type pages to research priorities 
and methods of accelerating research, including changes in 
institutional approaches, the committee's report delved into 
public oversight.  Listing "gaps and inconsistencies in 
current oversight" programs, the committee said in part:

-- "... The complexities and anomalies of the current system 
may be attributed to the overlapping jurisdiction of several 
agencies and the diversity of organisms to be regulated, and 
the attempt to make the decision-making 'template' developed 
for registration of conventional chemical pesticides 
applicable to biologically based controls.

-- "Current federal oversight generally evaluates the risks 
of biological-control macroorganisms using the procedures 
developed for exotic plant pests under the Federal Plant 
Pest Act (FFPA); microbial biological-control agents are 
subject to oversight procedures developed for chemical 
pesticides under (FIFRA).  Neither set of procedures is 
tailored for registration of biological-control agents; 
therefore, both pose unnecessary barriers to registration of 
biological-control organisms."

 'Dual Review' at EPA

Noting that EPA reviews killed products under TSCA and 
others under FIFRA, the committee said the situation 
"results in a dual review process within EPA, with the 
manufacturing portion of the process reviewed separately 
from the field release of the killed microbial pesticide."  
The distinctions in TSCA and FIFRA for review of "chemical 
intermediates" is irrelevant for microbial pesticides, the 
committee said.  The discussion of oversight continued:

-- "The existing fragmented oversight process employs 
different assessment criteria to biological-control 
organisms that pose similar human or environmental risks, 
resulting in unnecessary scrutiny of some low-risk organisms 
and almost complete lack of regulatory review of others.

-- "The most important inconsistency is the differential 
treatment of macroorganisms by USDA/APHIS under FFPA and of 
microorganisms by EPA under FIFRA.  For example, neither EPA 
nor APHIS regulates nonpathogenic nematodes, whereas both 
agencies regulate microorganisms.  In addition, microbes are 
exempt from oversight if vectored by a nonpathogenic, 
indigenous macroorganism (such as a nematode).  There is no 
clearly defined process for risk assessment of biological-
control macroorganisms that are not plant pests, resulting in 
indecisiveness in granting permits for field release....

-- "To provide appropriate oversight of biological-control 
organisms and products, USDA, EPA and other federal and 
state agencies with oversight authority should jointly 
develop criteria and protocols specifically for the testing, 
registration and use of living control organisms, 
biological-control products or plants resistant to pests or 
diseases.

-- "No formal oversight structure exists for traditionally 
bred resistant plants, whereas genetically engineered 
resistance will, it appears, be subject to close scrutiny.  
A question confronting policy makers is whether host plant 
resistance accomplished through genetic engineering should 
receive a higher degree of scrutiny than resistance achieved 
through traditional plant breeding.  Such a distinction 
embedded in regulatory practice would not necessarily 
reflect differences between actual human or environmental 
health risks posed by the two technologies."

Options for Improvement Outlined

Calling for departure from current oversight practice, the 
committee said agencies' criteria for risk assessment must 
vary with the possibilities presented by each organism, 
product or resistant plant.  Suggesting the desirability of 
Technical Advisory Groups, the committee characterized these 
as "a consortium of representatives from government and 
research established to provide advice to the government on 
the safety of biological organisms for weed control."  The 
committee emphasized:

"The U.S. EPA and the USDA, currently responsible for 
oversight of pesticide regulations, should develop and 
publish a guide to risk criteria, data requirements and 
oversight procedures that apply to importation, movement, 
introduction, testing and release or registration of 
biological-control organisms or products."

The 89-page report concluded:

-- "... Principles of ecology that lay the foundation of EBPM 
must be incorporated into implementation and oversight.  An 
important goal of EBPM is to restore and preserve balance to 
the managed ecosystem by duplicating natural processes to the 
maximum extent possible.  

-- "Risk assessment also should reflect that principle.  
Biological-control products must be developed and implemented 
in ways that complement managed ecosystems and facilitate the 
biological and natural controls already existing to suppress 
pests.

-- "Monitoring of new products and processes is key.  The 
resultant information will lead to early identification of 
durability problems.  The knowledge gained from this 
monitoring of the dynamic interactions among organisms will 
increase the understanding needed to manage old and new pests 
in a safe, profitable and durable way."

CHINA TO CUT LPG, OLEFIN IMPORT TARIFFS TO 6% BY APRIL 1

By:
David Hanna, Christopher Park, Platt's Tokyo


China this week announced plans to cut in half tariffs on chemical imports
effective Apr 1, pledging to 'open the chemical sector wider to foreign
investment'. Included in the change are import tariff cuts for olefins and
LPG to 6% from 12%. The International Business Journal under Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation published two lists of new tariff
rates for a total of 363 items, mostly related to petrochemical and
chemical industries. Import tariffs for liquefied ethylene, propylene,
butylene, butadiene will also be slashed by 50% to 6%. Rates for propane
and butane will be slashed by 3% to 6% starting April. New rates for
imported benzene, toluene and xylene will be lowered to 6% from the present
12% by then. China said it would cut import tariffs of over 4,000 items by
an average 35% to 23% from Apr 1. No information was forthcoming on duties
for polymer imports. Traders in Korea and Japan peg current duty rates on
commodity polymers at 15-30%. China's Ministry of Chemical Industry
forecasts that the industry's output value will grow by 8% from 1995 to
Yuan 245-mil ($306-mil) in 1996. Meanwhile, chemical imports grew by 8% to
$5-bil, while exports rose 20.9% to $3.8-bil during the first half of 1995.
Industry sources believe these figures should rise once the new tariffs go
into effect.

METHANEX TO BUILD 900,000 MT/YR METHANOL PLANT IN CHILE

By:
Louise Egan, Santiago

   Methanex, the world's largest methanol producer which owns a methanol
plant in Cape Horn, Chile, will build a second plant in Cabo Negro, in the
southern region of the country. The new facility will have a capacity of
900,000mt/yr of methanol. Enap, the Chilean national oil company, which is
the principal supplier of natural gas for the project, has stated that
construction will be completed in December 1996. The Chilean government has
authorized $350-mil in additional investments by the Canadian company for
the project. Together with the Cape Horn plant, Methanex will be producing
1.7-mil mt/yr, or 12% of world demand for methanol. Methanex Cabo Negro
plans to eventually export methanol to other Latin American countries.
Chilean consumption is expected to reach 100,000mt/yr in the short term.

INDIAN CHEMICALS MINISTRY WANTS IMPORT DUTY CUTS

By:
Neel Patri, New Delhi

   The Indian ministry of chemicals and petrochemicals has sought
across-the-board cut in the import duty on several chemicals and
petrochemicals to a uniform 10% from the present levels that range from 15%
to 50%, officials said.
   In its memorandum to the finance ministry which is preparing the 1996
federal budget, the ministry has also suggested hiking duties on some
catalysts.
   The chemicals recommended for duty reduction to 10% include carbon black
feedstock which bears 30% tariff at present, napthalene which carries 30%
duty, high purity limestone that is subject to 50% duty at present, and
cumene that carries 20% duty now.
   However, the import tariff on methanol may be set at 40% compared with
the present 50%. The ministry is seeking a cut in methanol duty from 50% to
40%.
   The items for which duty hikes have been recommended include four
specific catalysts used in the manufacture of ethylene, formaldehyde,
de-sulphurisation process, and methyl ethyl ketone from secondary butyl
alcohol (from the present 25% to 50%.
   Simultaneously, the ministry has favored reduction in import tariff on
specific pesticides to 30% from the present 40% and in order to encourage
caustic soda chemical manufacturers to shift to membrane cell technology
from mercury cell process of manufacture, total exemption of capital goods
imports needed for this switch-over has been recommended. The present duty
is 25% on capital goods imports.
   'The idea is to keep duties on basic rawmaterial low and the end
chemicals onthe higher side.' 'The idea is to keep duties on basic raw
material low and the end chemicals on the higher side to make import of
former cheaper for export after value addition. Some sort of protection for
the indigenous industry against cheap imports and dumping has been one of
the criteria,' explained a senior ministry official.
   Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corp has selected Norsk
Hydro and the Madras-based WS Industries as partners for a proposed 150,000
mt/yr PVC resin project, expected to cost around Rupee 7.5-bil ($214-mil),
TIDCO officials said this week.
   Company directors have approved a proposal to offer 51% of the equity to
Norsk Hydro, while WS Industries would hold 10% and TIDCO 11%. The equity
sharing proposal would have to be approved by the Tamil Nadu government,
which owns TIDCO.
   The PVC project is likely to be located at Ennore, south of Madras,
where a new port is proposed to be built by the government. The port
project includes building a chemicals import terminal.
   The PVC project entails importing 124,000 mt/yr of ethylene dichloride
and 48,000 mt/yr as feed. A market survey commissioned by TIDCO showed that
the demand for PVC was growing in the southern region, and that fresh
capacity was called for.
   At present, there are two major PVC producers meeting demand in southern
India, Chemplast Sanmar with 48,000 mt/yr capacity, and Dhrangadhara
Chemical Works with 42,000 mt/yr capacity. Both are located in Tamil Nadu.
   State-owned Hindustan Organic Chemicals Ltd has been allotted land at
Baikampady village near the New Mangalore port in southern Karnataka state
to build a chemical terminal, a company release said.
   HOC will invest some Rupee 360-mil ($10-mil) in the 50,000 kl terminal,
to be built in two stages. HOC, a major importer and exporter of chemicals,
is currently renting storage tank facilities at the New Mangalore Port for
operations at Cochin, as well as for exporting phenol and acetone.
   'In all, 10 storage tanks are expected to be constructed under phase
one. It is proposed to handle a diverse range of chemicals, including
benzene, toluene, xylenes, cumene, phenol, acetone, and methanol. The first
stage is expected to be completed during 1996-97,' the release said.

NWE POLYMERS PRICES REACH EXTREMES IN VOLATILE 1995 MARKET

By:
Elinor Else, Platt's London


   European polymer prices rollercoastered in 1995, peaking on high demand
and tight supply but then crashing as a slower economy, high stocks and
higher prices undermined buying interest. Another major influence on Europe
was the Asian market, whose demand was the main motor behind market
balances world- wide.
   All the polymers started the year at relatively high price levels, with
the polyolefins averaging around DM1.80/kg FD Germany in early January, PVC
a few pfennigs lower and general purpose polystyrene a little over
DM2.00/kg FD Germany.
   There were some difficulties related to local currencies weakening
against the deutschmark in the UK and Italy which held back prices in those
markets. New import tariffs on polymers moving into the EU temporarily
slowed shipments from Mexico and eastern Europe. But underlying demand was
good and supply was balanced to tight in most markets.
   PVC, polystyrene and PP were all firm through the first quarter of 1995
as producers pushed through targets and supply was either tight - as in the
case of PVC which suffered a series of monomer and polymer outages - or at
least balanced to supply.
   But towards the end of the first quarter the first few signals of change
started to emerge. Firstly, demand for low density polyethylene began to
slip late in Q1 as consumers started to run down stocks built at the end of
1994. Also, prices adjustments were made to bring countries that had
suffered from a weak currency against the German mark back into line.
   This meant a push for price adjustments in the UK, Italy and France but
it also meant German prices had to be held steady while the rest of the EU
caught up.
   Meanwhile, relative strength in German prices started to attract the
attention of east European importers as well as sellers of other exotics.
This began to undermine the German LDPE market, the market which tends to
lead price levels around Europe.
   During April and May PVC prices were stabilizing as demand for pipes
proved slower than expected and finished pipe stocks were said to be high.
Polypropylene and polystyrene were both benefiting from stronger
fundamentals and prices for both of these polymers remained firm.
   Two things happened: the traditional summer slowdown and a crackdown on
VAT collection and smuggling of polymers into China.
   The effect of the 'summer lull' is a regular seasonal effect and is
factored into most people's forecasts for supply and demand during the
year: in later July, demand will tend to slacken off as converters in much
of Europe close their factories for all or part of Aug. Demand in Sep is
usually slow to start but will pickup until Oct, which is usually a 'normal
month'.
   However, the sudden halt to Chinese buying, along with the pressure on
Asian prices from ample US export availabilities, was not expected. The
initial effect was to divert a significant proportion of US and other
exports into Europe. Longer term, the effect was an overall dampening of
global polymer demand and a sense among consumers in Europe that there was
plenty of material available to cover their needs.
   Prices for PVC, PE and PP started to erode in June as European buyers
sensed a price decrease to come as the Asian problems emerged and European
demand was set to slow for the summer.
   PS resisted as producers pushed for another increase and succeeded in
both June and July.
   But by the end of July, all polymer prices were on a downtrend that was
only to bottom out at the very end of the year. With Chinese buying on
hold, exotic availabilities were plentiful and west European producers
found it more difficult to control stocks by selling excess supply
overseas.
   In addition, the summer lull lasted through Oct, adding several weeks of
very low demand to the expected period as consumers rode down their stocks
and were confident that prices would be lower in the coming weeks.
   This process of destocking and buying hand-to-mouth characterised the
latter half of 1995.
   The lack of forward buying kept up considerable pressure on producers
and attempts to control stocks through cutting production were only
partially successful.
   There was considerable competition to maintain market shares in the
various European markets: for example in the UK market there were several
instances of producers undercutting each others' prices for PP and PE.
Exports were moved out at discount prices to ease pressure on mounting
stocks.
   Through Oct and Nov, the production cutbacks did have an effect on
producers' stock levels which were better balanced by the end of the year
except for some cases in the PE market. The re-entry of Chinese buyers in
Nov lent some support to European and US markets, even if that demand was
only a form of prebuying ahead of import license changes in 1996.
   But prices in Europe had hit bottom and with or without China, many in
the industry said that with prices below available cost in many cases,
there was no room for further price erosion.
   PP, PE, and PVC all ended the year with the low end of the price range
firmly below the DM1/kg FD Germany level. PS had fallen steeply but had
stabilized close to DM1.50/kg FD Germany for general purpose material and
DM0.10/kg higher for high impact.
   Increases were announced for Jan 1 for PP and PE, which were felt to
have reached unsustainably low levels. PS has not seen a price increase
announcement and suppliers say they are looking to rollover prices from Dec
into Jan. However, consumers say there is still room for a slight erosion
in PS prices and as Chinese demand is not expected to pick up until later
in Feb, the impetus for price increases seems likely to be limited until
later in Q1.
   PVC pipe grade has seen a period of poor demand, the summer too dry to
allow for much construction or cable-TV pipe laying and the winter being
the traditionally low demand season. Some are indicating price increases
could be on the cards for Mar or Apr.
   In broader terms, most in the industry expect there to be some
improvement in early 1996 as demand and prices both recover to more normal
levels.
   Consumer stocks are more balanced now and prices are seen as either
stable or firming, producers argue, so that when demand kicks in in late
January, coverters will come into the market to top up low stocks.
   Overall growth in underlying demand for polymers is expected to grow at
around 3% in 1996 and both buyers and producers are hoping for a less
volatile year in 1996.

ASIAN BENZENE PRICES SLUMP IN 1995

By:
Joanna Lim, Platt's Singapore


   Asian benzene prices began the year bullish, driven largely by strong
styrene demand. In response to spiralling styrene prices, Japanese and
Korean producers cranked up operations at their plants, with less benzene
subsequently available in the spot market.
   The strength of the US benzene market also led to less deepsea product
moving into Asia. At the same time, plant turnarounds in Japan and Korea in
Mar through June also heightened the region's shortage.
   Benzene prices climbed $5-10/mt monthly during the first quarter, with
prices peaking in April at $395-400/mt FOB Korea from $365-370/mt in Jan.
   In May, styrene prices in Asia started to deteriorate, brought on by
China's sudden withdrawal from styrenic derivative imports, dueto Beijing's
measures to crack down on smuggling and tax invasion in China's ports.
   Local traders had been evading a 17% value added tax on imported resins
by negotiating private agreements with local authorities. State officials
were despatched to the ports to enforce the VAT collection, and this
brought business to a halt.
   Styrene producers throughout the region reduced their operating rates in
order to cope with high inventory. Japanese producers cut operations to by
20-30%; Taiwan producers reduced production by 30-50% and in Korea, Yukong
Oxichemical had a unscheduled shutdown of its 300,000 mt/yr styrene plant
for one week, citing bearish market conditions for the outage.
   Furthermore, ethylene plants throughout Asia cut runs by 15-20% in July.
Lack of Chinese demand for ethylene-derivative products had led to drastic
drop in its prices, prompting ethylene producers to run their plants just
enough for their own downstream requirements, dropping their export ratio
altogether.
   In Nov, benzene prices firmed in Asia, driven by a surge in Chinese
demand for styrenic derivatives. This time the Chinese government was known
to be planning to reduce the export rebate on the value added tax next
year.
   From Jan 1 1996, the current 17% VAT and 14% rebate for exports will be
revised to a 9% rebate. The new rebate will apply to imported material
delivered into China from Jan 1.
   Traders also report that import licenses for 1995 are due to expire on
Dec 20, and that the Chinese government is expected to severely limit the
number of new licenses issued next year.
   These two factors prompted Chinese end-users - who were already low on
stocks because of a clampdown on imports and speculative trading since May
- to buy large quantities before the end of the year.
   Last week Korea rejected bids at $240/mt FOB, holding out for $250/mt
and above. The last trade into India last week was at $290/mt C+F. This
week sellers have brought up their offers to around $300/mt C+F, following
the US Jan contract price nomination at 90 cts/lb, 10 cts/lb over Dec.
   Meanwhile other consumers in Asia are staying sidelined amid uncertainty
over the benzene price trend. Most agree that in the short term the market
is firm. However, they refer to waning Chinese demand for styrene and
ethylene derivatives as the basis for a possible return to weak benzene
prices in Asia.
   Toluene began the year on a bearish note in Asia, with ample deepsea
cargoes outpacing demand. It was only towards mid-March that the market
began to firm, as Korean producers began their plant turnarounds.
   Between May and July, toluene prices held up relatively better than
benzene due to its comparatively tighter supply. And, unlike benzene,
toluene enjoyed relatively steady demand from China where it is used to
upgrade 95 RON unleaded gasoline to 97 RON.
   But toluene's decline escalated with the unplanned shutdown of two TDP
units in Korea in early Aug. In order to cope with their benzene and
xylenes surpluses Korea's Yukong Ltd and HanWha Energy shut down their TDP
units indefinately from early August, and the surplus in Korean toluene
which subsequently followed led to increasingly bearish market sentiments.
Bearish benzene prices also severely softened the toluene markets.
   Producers also had been quick to decrease their prices in order to to
keep arbitrage cargoes out of the region.
   Taiwan's Chinese Petroleum Corp is known to issue monthly toluene buy
tenders for delivery two months out, thereby extending eligibility to US,
NWE and other deepsea product.
   Asian producers therefore did not rule out the possibility of the
traders shipping out additional toluene to Asia along with CPC's volumes
especially in times of weak market conditions in the US.
   Currently toluene prices have firmed in line with tight supply and also
because of strong benzene and MTBE markets in north and southeast Asia.

US OLEFINS PRICES WEAKEN STEADILY AS DEMAND DWINDLES

By:
Richard Capuchino, Platt's Houston; Nicholas Towasser, Platt's New York


   US olefin markets experienced a downturn in prices through 1995, however
none more drastically than ethylene and refinery grade propylene. Both
products lost about 10 cts/lb in contract prices from the beginning to the
end of the year.
   Ethylene began 1995 settling up 1 ct/lb in Jan, Feb and Mar to place
most contracts in 29-33 cts/lb range, while spot prices were at 31-34
cts/lb FOB USG by the end of Mar.
   The National Petroleum Refiners Association reported Q1 1995 inventories
at 1.28-bil lbs, up from the 1.11-bil lbs in Q1 1994. Meanwhile, Q1 1995
production totaled 11.64-bil lbs, down from the 11.70-bil lbs in Q1 1994.
   By late Mar, demand began to fall, while spot prices also fell from the
low 30s to 28-29 cts/lb. Producers rolled over contract prices from March
to 29-33 cts/lb in April and May.
   Jun brought the first decrease in ethylene prices, when producers agreed
to settle contracts down 0.50 cts/lb. Contract prices for Jul also settled
down 1 ct/lb to 27.50-31.50 cts/lb. Spot prices in Jul had also fallen to
25.50-26.50 cts/lb due to consumers meeting commitments from contract
material.
   The NPRA reported that both inventories and production increased in Q2.
Inventories in Q2 totalled 1.88-bil lbs, a two-year high, while Q2 outputn
totaled 11.95-bil lbs.
   High Q2 inventories were due to turnarounds scheduled for Sep and Oct.
High stocks and decreased demand from polyethylene producers caused several
ethylene producers to cut production rates to about 80% capacity. By late
Sep producers had settled Aug and Sep contracts down 1.50 cts/lb placing
Sep contracts at 24.50-28.50 cts/lb, with spot prices at 22-23 cts/lb FOB
USG.
   By early Oct, at least one producer made a three-month nomination of Oct
down 1 ct, November down 0.50 ct and a rollover for Dec. Some sources
doubted the nomination's chances of acceptance, and by mid-Nov it seemed
most consumers had chosen to take a month-by-month approach.
   Around the same time a rumor circulated that Union Texas had offered to
settle October volumes with a formula of 75-80% at an Oct contract price of
1.5 cts down from September and 20-25% at a Oct spot price of 15.5 cts/lb.
Two Texas producers said they settled some accounts for Oct at a level
'competitive' with the formula. One producer said the formula resulted in a
contract price of 20.70 cts/lb for Oct, and settled some accounts at that
level.
   Also complicating the Oct contract price was the question of at what
level exactly the Sep price had been. According to one report Exxon, in an
effort to devise a contract price that would more accurately reflect the
market price and eliminate the need for discounts, revised its Sep contract
price from 24.50 cts/lb to 23.50 cts/lb. However, another producer refused
to revise its Sep contact price, and maintained an Oct contract of 23
cts/lb.
   Early in Oct there was unconfirmed talk of some customers demanding an
additional 0.25 ct/lb discount on the Sep contract price, in addition to
the original 1.5 cts/lb decrease from Aug.
   By late Nov, most sources reported settling Oct at 22-23 cts/lb, down
1.5 cts/lb from Sep, though another producer, who had not yet settled
accounts, did report hearing an Oct contract of 21 cts/lb as a reference
point.
   By the year's end, neither Nov nor Dec had definitively settled. Some
producers reported invoicing or settling Nov down 1 ct/lb. One producer
reported settling half its accounts with a two-month settlement: Nov at 20
cts/lb, down 1 ct/lb, and Dec at 19.50 cts/lb, down a further 0.50 cts/lb.
   Another producer reported some participants were working toward a
two-month agreement. He said a reduction of 1 ct/lb for Nov was tentatively
agreed, and that talks centered around whether Dec would settle down 0.50
ct/lb or 1 ct/lb. However, one consumer reported offers to settle Nov at
more than 1 ct/lb down.
   This week, one producer reported that settlements for Nov varied from
down 1 ct to 1.50 cts/lb, and that Dec negotiations were still ongoing.
   To compound the year-end confusion, in Dec several US PE producers
announced a 5 cts/lb US domestic price increase for all grades of PE
effective Jan 1. Similarly, one producer expected higher feedstock prices
as the colder weather might make producers less inclined to give
concessions.
   Fiber grade ethylene glycol began the year tight due to strong global
demand for polyester, while weather continued to affect demand of
anti-freeze grade. Spot prices for A-F grade began the year at 30-31 cts/lb
FOB USG. Industrial grade was pegged at 29-31 cts/lb at first of the year,
with contract prices for fiber grade at 28.5 cts/lb.
   Strong demand for PET kept the MEG market tight. Fiber grade was tight,
with spot supply almost non-existent at the beginning of the year.
   In Mar, producers nominated a 2 ct/lb increase for fiber grade due to
strong demand and extremely low inventories. By mid-Apr, fiber grade had
settled at 30.5 cts/lb, while industrial and A-F grade were at 30-32 cts/lb
for spot deals.
   In mid-Apr sources reported that A-F grade buyers were looking to indus
grade market for incremental volumes. Export demand for fiber grade was
described as 'phenomenal' in May.
   In early Jun, one producer nominated 2 ct/lb increases on all grades for
both list and off-list prices. Stocks on all three grades remained
relatively low.
   Spot prices in late Jun were seen at 30-34 cts/lb FOB USG for industrial
and fiber grade.
   Mid-Jul saw fiber grade contracts settle at 33.5 cts/lb FD USG, while
spot prices for A-F and industrial grades around 33-35 cts/lb FOB USG.
Strong demand and low inventories forced some producers in late Jul to buy
material in the spot market.
   A traditional seasonal decrease in A-F grade demand saw a 'lull' in
demand. By late Aug spot prices for industrial and A-F grades fell to 29-31
cts/lb FOB USG, while demand for fiber grade continued strong. The decrease
in demand also allowed for a slight buildup in inventories.
   Mid-Sep saw producers cautiously building up stocks, recalling the
previous winter's mildness.
   Throughout Q4 sources reported generally less-than-dynamic A-F grade
sales. In mid-Oct there was talk of Mexican and Venezuelan industrial grade
material available at 26-27 cts/lb FOB USG, but few buyers were seen. Some
sources believe the A-F grade buying season will continue into 1996, as
consumers maintain low stocks.
   For propylene, the year began with contract prices for all grades in the
high teens and low 20 cts/lb range.
   Jan contracts for all grades settled up 1 ct/lb from Dec, with polymer
grade at 21.75 cts/lb, chemical grade at 20.25 cts/lb and refinery grade at
18.50-19 cts/lb. Spot polymer grade showed a 10 ct/lb premium above
contract, chemical grade had a 2-4 ct/lb premium, but spot refinery grade
was about 1-1.50 cts/lb below contract.
   Some tightness in supply was noted in the market when several producers
took turnarounds at FCC units along the Gulf Coast early in the year.
Strong demand and scheduled outages kept market snug for several months,
with producers having little opportunity to build inventories.
   Alkylation values for refinery grade propylene were at 7-8 cts/lb in
Feb, with values depressed by low gasoline prices. Values of 6-7 cts/lb in
late Mar continued to encourage producers to sell refinery grade on the
spot market where it commanded a higher value. Excess refinery grade
material was entering the US Gulf from California, the Midwest and South
Louisiana.
   By early Mar, producers were building inventories. Contract and spot
prices slipped for refinery grade propylene by early Jun to 15.75-18.25
cts/lb and 15.00-15.50 cts/lb FOB USG respectively, due to overproduction
and low alkylation values. However, contract prices for polymer and
chemical grade had added 1 ct/lb in Feb, Mar and Apr to 24.75 cts/lb for
polymer grade and 23.25 cts/lb for chemical grade for Apr.
   Although an increase was passed in Apr, discussions were drawn out due
to the levelling off in ethylene prices and the decline in the refinery
grade market. Discussions for Apr included talk of a 0.5-1 ct/lb decrease
in prices. However, after the 1 ct/lb increase in Apr, consumers settled
May as a rollover.
   By mid-May, outages at several Gulf Coast fluid catalytic cracking units
helped firm the market, while alkylation values as high as 15-17 cts/lb
were attributed to the onset of the driving season.
   Due to excess supply of polymer grade material, spot prices fell to
25-26 cts/lb FOB USG for polymer grade and 23-24 cts/lb FOB USG for
chemical grade in Jun. Demand for the higher grade propylene was softer due
to falling polypropylene demand.
   By mid-Jul the weak polymer market was also affecting refinery grade
propylene producers who upgrade material via splitting, and spot prices for
all grades had fallen below contract prices by late Aug. Polymer grade spot
was at 20.50- 21.50 cts/lb FOB USG, while chemical grade at 19.50- 20.50
cts/lb and spot refinery grade at 14.25-15.00 cts/lb ex-tank FOB USG.
   Inventories for Q2 totaled 965-mil lbs, while production totaled 6.7-bil
lbs. By late Sep, spot prices had declined further due to ample supply and
lower demand for all three grades. All spot prices had fallen considerably
below contracts prices by the end of Q3.
   Although some US sources reported settling Oct polymer and chemical
grade propylene down 1.5 cts/lb, Nov down 1.5 cts/lb and Dec down 1 ct/lb,
the Dec contract price for both grades seemed to be very much in question
by the year's end.
   One source reported discussions were divided between a large number of
producers who contended Dec should be down 1 ct/lb, and some consumers who
contended it should be down 1.5 cts/lb.
   By early Dec, polymer grade was heard in the pipeline at 11 cts/lb and
10 cts/lb in railcars. Chemical grade was heard at 10 cts/lb in pipeline
and 9.5 cts/lb in railcar. Refinery grade propylene also dropped to
significant lows. Its Dec contract price settled between 9.00 and 9.50
cts/lb, while Dec spot was reported between 8.50 and 9.00 cts/lb.
   Butadiene contracts began the year settling up 1 ct to 25 cts/lb, while
spot prices were at 25-27 cts/lb CIF USG. Jan 1 inventories totalled
221-mil lbs/yr, up 39-mil lbs/yr from Dec 1994.
   Feb 1 inventories totaled 229-mil lbs/yr, while spot market at 23-24
cts/lb CIF USG. Producers that were seeking to build inventories in
anticipation of turnarounds allowed stocks to total 235-mil lbs on Mar 1,
and reported approaching capacity at storage tanks by early Mar.
   After rolling over in Feb and Mar at 25 cts/lb, butadiene contracts
settled down 2 cts to 23 cts/lb in Apr. Apr 1 inventories totaled 225-mil
lbs/yr, which was the first decline in stock levels since Nov 1994. Spot
prices in mid-Apr were at 22-23 cts/lb CIF USG.
   May 1 inventories totaled 249-mil lbs, while spot prices were pegged at
20-22 cts/lb CIF USG. However, the industry was at odds over the reporting
of Jun 1 inventories at 145-mil lbs. The decrease was due to downtime at
ethylene and butadiene units, decreased imports and high freight rates.
Contracts settled at a rollover at 23 cts/lb in both May and Jun.
   Spot prices in early Jul were pegged at 23-24 cts/lb CIF USG. Jul 1
inventories rebounded somewhat to 166-mil lbs/yr, but this figure was
without the participation of one large consumer that took issue with the
Jun 1 figure.
   Jul contract prices settled late in the month at 25 cts/lb, while Aug
contracts settled unchanged. Aug 1 inventories totaled 173-mil lbs. In Sep
butadiene derivative markets reported weakness, though this was offset by
the turnaround of two major butadiene plants. Sep 1 inventories totaled
200-mil lbs, which was ascribed to expected turnarounds in Oct and to
several tanks taking on extra material for operators whose other tanks were
out of service.
   Contracts rolled over in Sep at 25 cts/lb. Spot transactions were
minimal due to high inventories. By the end of Sep, spot butadiene was
pegged at 23-23.5 cts/lb CIF USG.
   In late Oct, Lyondell, Texas Petrochemical and Shell nominated the Nov
contract price at 23 cts/lb, down 2 cts from Oct. The downward push came at
a time of high stocks.
   From Jul to Oct, consultants Hodson & Co reported a sustained rise in US
butadiene inventories. Oct 1 inventories were reported at 226-mil lbs, an
increase of 13% over Sep.
   As consumers sought to work off butadiene bought at 25 cts/lb, the spot
market seemed to vanish by mid-Nov. Aside from the uneconomic pricing of
imported material, sources also said storage was often an issue.
   As the year closed, high inventories continued to weigh on the market,
and there was unconfirmed talk of at least a large consumer demanding yet
another price decrease for Jan of 2 cts/lb, pushing the contract down to 19
cts/lb.
   In early Jan, one trader heard reports that three producers are indeed
settling at this level. Two producers have reportedly settled 19 cts/lb for
Jan, while a third has granted a 'temporary volume allowance', in the
trader's words, bringing the net contract price to 19 cts/lb, but
preserving 21 cts/lb as a basis for Feb negotiations.

ETHYLENE

   Shanghai is to invest an estimated Yuan 40-bil ($4.8-bil) to build an
ethylene plant in a joint venture with neighbouring Zhejiang province, the
Shanghai Star bi-weekly newspaper reported.
   The plant would be built in the Caojing chemical base near Hangzhou Bay
and would produce 600,000 mt/yr, with production starting as soon as
possible, according to the report.
   'Foreign funds would be introduced to promote the project,' the report
quoted Yu Dexiong, a senior chemical industry industry official, as
saying.
   Yu said Shanghai's strategy was to develop the chemical industry not
only in the city but also in the Yangtse river valley.
   The Shanghai Chemical Industry Bureau was recently transformed into an
entreprise and renamed Shanghai Chemical Shareholding (Group) Co in a move
to give new impetus to the chemical industry.

KOREA ETHYLENE DEREGULATION

   Eight of Korea's ethylene producers plan to negotiate with the
government on matters regarding deregulation of investment policy on naptha
cracker expansions, according to a Korean press report last week.
   A meeting was held recently of senior officials from eight of the
nation's top petrochemical producers who are discussing how to better
coordinate investments in naphtha cracker expansion projects.
   According to an industry source, the government is concerned about the
new round of ethylene expansions based on negative results from previous
expansions.
   However, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy is set to deregulate
the petrochemical industry in mid-1996 and is reportedly set to authorize
Hyundai Petrochemical's new naphtha cracker expansion project by early
1996. Currently, all investments geared toward expansion projects must meet
approval from the Ministry.

JAPAN'S IDEMITSU PETROCHEMICAL

   Japan's Idemitsu Petrochemical has sold its 15% stake in a polyethylene
joint venture based in Malaysia to UK's BP Chemicals, a Petronas source
said last week.
   BP now has a 60% controlling interest in the 200,000 mt/yr PE plant in
Kertih, on the northeast coast of the Malaysian peninsula, with Malaysian
national oil company Petronas holding 40% as before, the source said.
   The plant produces high density polyethylene and linear low density
polyethylene using BP technology.

POLYETHYLENE TEREPHALATE

   Continental Pet Espana announced plans to construct a new
bottle-manufacturing plant that will more than double polyethylene
terephalate demand to 55,000 mt/yr.
   The facility, to be located in Madrid, is expected to be completed in
1997. A possible second phase would boost PET demand to 70,000 mt/yr.
   Although the Continental Pet Europe subsidiary, which currently has four
plants in Spain, usually buys raw material from central European producers,
local supply is poised to increase.
   In November, Seda de Barcelona subsidiary Catalana de Polimers announced
plans to boost PET production to 150,000 mt/yr from 40,000 mt/yr by
year-end 1996.
   Meanwhile, Eastman Chemical is building a 120,000 mt/yr PET plant in San
Roque in southern Spain, in conjunction with Cepsa subsidiary Interquisa
doubling purified terephthalic acid capacity to 400,000 mt/yr. Both
projects are also scheduled to be completed by year-end 1996.

LPG

   Saudi Aramco and Kuwait Petroleum Corp have announced January LPG
postings for propane at $205/mt FOB, an increase of $10/mt over the
December price. Butane has been set at $188/mt FOB, unchanged from the
December level.
   Last week, BP announced January North Sea prices at $230/mt FOB for
propane, an increase of $50/mt, while butane was posted at $155/mt, down
$7/mt from December.

SUPERFUND

   The Republican balanced budget plan vetoed by President Clinton included
a short-term extension of the Superfund excise tax on petroleum and
chemical feedstocks and a corporate environmental tax.
   The tax was due to expire midnight Dec 31, and will not be collected
after that date until there is a budget agreement between the White House
and houses of Congress.
   The excise tax on petroleum and chemical feedstocks was extended for
nine months, pending efforts to overhaul and reauthorize the existing
program. The budget plan also extended the 5 cts/bbl oil spill liability
tax, which was due to expire Dec 31.
   The fund is close to its $1-billion cap, at which point collections
cease. The 0.1 ct/gal tax to clean leaks from underground storage tanks
also expired Dec 31, and is not extended under the Republican plan.

PROPYLENE OXIDE

   Dow Chemical and its subsidiaries plan to expand propylene oxide
capacity at Freeport, Texas; Stade, Germany; and Aratu, Brazil, by a total
of 250,000mt/yr through continuous process technology improvements, the
company said.
   In 1994, Dow announced the addition of more than 227,000mt/yr of PO
capacity at its Plaquemine, Lousiana; Freeport, Stade and Aratu facilities.
All of these expansions will be completed by the end of 1996.
   Dow will now add an additional 45,000mt/yr at its Freeport plant by the
end of 1996, bringing the plant's total capacity increase to 160,000mt/yr
since 1994.
   An additional 205,000mt/yr of capacity will be added at the Stade and
Aratu sites. Dow expects to achieve these two increments between mid-1998
and early 1999.

What's Ahead
for Chiral in '96

The past year saw chiral technology transition from being more than
just a niche in some corner of a pharmaceutical company to become
a major part of drug-development efforts. With the breathtaking
revelations of enzymes, receptors, and genes as new potential
targets for therapeutic interventions being made, Big Pharma now
finds it obliged to team with combinatorial chemistry firms just to
keep up with all the exploding opportunities. To be sure, not all
the potential therapeutic molecules are chiral, but the majority
are so.

Stereochemical technology has applications also in
nonpharmaceutical areas, such as pesticides, flavors, aromas, dyes,
liquid crystals, and polymers. The new year is not yet the time
when we will see maturation in the pharmaceutical sector, however,
and these other fields will likely remain minor outlets, except
perhaps for liquid-crystal applications, which will continue to be
significant. Will chiral technology firms miss the "ground floor"
opportunities to be had in these other areas, or are their plates
simply too full as it is?

The unfolding year will undoubtedly yield new, dazzling feats in
the synthetic duplication of natural molecules.  Most of them,
however, will likely continue to be marvels of academic
accomplishment but will be commercially inviable because of poor
yields, impractical complexity, or costly raw materials.  They
will, though, point up new possibilities for asymmetric chemical
catalysts and resolving agents.

Biocatalysts -- live microbes and refined enzymes -- will probably
carve out significant new roles for themselves in 1996. They
already have an important place in stereochemical technology, but
organic chemists are beginning to look more favorably on them as
useful tools, in part because genetic engineering, protein
engineering, and new screening technologies are delivering up newer
and better enzyme performances.

Synthesis and separation will continue to be opposing strategies
for chiral molecule manufacture this new year. But companies
increasingly see the virtue of combining the two in a way that
makes both economically feasible and efficient.

5.5 Million ChiRex
Shares Offered

Sepracor Inc. (33 Locke Drive, Marlborough, MA  01752;  Tel:
508/481-6700, Fax: 508/481-7683) and Sterling Organics Ltd.
(Sterling Place, Dudley, Cramlington, Northumberland NE23 7QG,
U.K.), a fine chemical company, will join forces to create a new
chiral technology company, ChiRex Inc.

The two companies jointly announced the filing by ChiRex Inc. of a
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
relating to a proposed offering of 5,500,000 shares of ChiRex
common stock.  Net proceeds from the proposed offering will be used
to combine Sepracor Inc.'s chiral chemistry business, which is
conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary, SepraChem Inc., with
Sterling Organics' in a newly formed U.S. company.  The offering
will be managed by CS First Boston, Lehman Brothers, and Smith
Barney Inc.  The S-1 has been filed with a proposed maximum
offering price of $16.50 per share.

ChiRex Inc. will combine SepraChem's chiral chemistry process
technology with Sterling Organics' large-scale chemical
manufacturing capability.  SepraChem, established in 1994, supplies
Sepracor and pharmaceutical companies with chiral pharmaceutical
intermediates and active ingredients.

The business of Sterling Organics was established in the 1960s to
manufacture pharmaceutical intermediates for Sterling Winthrop Ltd.
(4 New Horizons Court, Harlequin Ave., Brentford, Middlesex  TW8
9EP, U.K.), of which it was a division.  Eastman Kodak Co. (343
State St., Rochester, NY  14650; Tel: 716/724-4000,  Fax: 716/477-
3681) sold Sterling Winthrop to Sanofi Winthrop (1 Onslow St.,
Guilford, Surrey  GU1 4YS, U.K.) in September 1994, which in turn
sold the Sterling Organics operation to a group consisting of
Sterling Organics management investors and Montagu Private Equity
Ltd., the European private equity arm of the HSBC Group (10 Lower
Thames St., London EC3R 6AE, U.K.).

Following the offering, ChiRex is expected to have approximately
9.8 million shares outstanding, of which Sepracor is expected to
own approximately 38%.

Celgene Adds
to Its Board

Celgene Corp. (7 Powderhorn Drive, Warren, NJ  07054;  Tel:
908/271-1001,  Fax: 908/271-4184) reports that its board of
directors elected Richard C. E. Morgan to be acting chairman and
chief executive officer effective Jan. 1, 1996, filling the post
held by Richard G. Wright, who is retiring.   Morgan, a director of
Celgene since 1986, is a general partner of Wolfensohn Partners
L.P. (New York) and serves as a director of several medical
technology companies.

Separately, Celgene said Sol J. Barer, president, chief operating
officer, and director, will replace Wright on the board's executive
committee, which also includes Chairman Frank T. Cary, and Morgan.

Chiroscience Turns to
Generic Bulk Actives

Chiroscience (Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge CB4
4WE, U.K.) is entering the intermediates market for generic drugs
with an initial goal of grabbing a 10% market share of global sales
of the bulk active ingredient for the anti-inflammatory and
analgesic medicine S-naproxen.  The company will concentrate on
development of technologies for low-cost production of generic bulk
actives, rather than manufacturing the materials itself.

Naproxen is one of the largest selling enantiomeric drugs, having
worldwide sales in the prescription market of about $1 billion,
perhaps $300 million in the U.S. alone.  Sales should go even
higher now that the over-the-counter market is being tapped.
Syntex is the major producer of naproxen and is its patent holder.
Naproxen is coming off patent, however, and Syntex has collaborated
with Procter & Gamble to market an OTC naproxen under the name
Aleve.  Lederle intends to enter the market with a generic version.

Chemically, naproxen is 2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propionic acid.  It
is, therefore, a chiral 2-substituted propionic compound, a
characteristic shared with the profens.  The substance is marketed
as the single S isomer, which has 28 times the biological activity
of the other isomer.

Chiroscience intends to license its technologies or use contract
manufacturers for supply of bulk actives, which the company will
sell to generic drug formulators.  The company will use a
technology licensed from DuPont (Wilmington, DE  19810; Tel:
302/695-5234,  Fax: 302/695-5286), using a catalyst for asymmetric
hydrogenation, to produce s-naproxen.  Other processes will be
developed using Chiroscience's own enzymatic catalyst technology.

Alan Shaw, sales director for technical services, says his company
believes it can significantly reduce process costs while
maintaining normal margins due to its chiral technology know-how.
Chiroscience currently provides chiral building blocks as well as
active ingredients for new chemical entities being developed by
other pharmaceutical firms.  The other component of the company's
business focuses on developing pharmaceuticals for marketing on its
own.  One category of pharmaceuticals in its development portfolio
is identified as "fast-track single isomers," which are single-
enantiomer versions of drugs already on the market.

Chiroscience estimates that the current worldwide market for bulk
S-naproxen is around 2,000 tons per year, worth $200 million.  This
could rise, however, to 3,000 tons, worth $300 million, by the year
2000, mainly as a result of introduction of OTC naproxen in Western
Europe.

Stereochemical Stock Watch

that its beta-interferon for multiple sclerosis has received a
favorable nod by an FDA committee. Vertex got a boost when its
marketing partner Glaxo Wellcome announced commencing a clinical

Chiral Technology
Aided by AIDS

The AIDS pandemic provides a virtual goldmine for chiral
technology, since almost all the drugs available and in development
for treating this disease and its associated conditions are
enantiomeric.

In 1995, the worldwide total sales of all currently marketed HIV
reverse-transcriptase inhibitors amounted to about $450 million.
Nucleoside types have about two-thirds of this market, or $300
million worldwide in 1995, while non-nucleosides have about one-
third, or $150 million.

The newest to join the arsenal of AIDS antivirals are HIV protease
inhibitors, which prevent the action of the enzyme needed by the
virus to convert directly transcribed precursors into mature
proteins as part of its replication process.  The first of this
type to receive regulatory approval, which came in December 1995,
is Invirase (generically called saquinavir) from Roche (Pf. 4002,
Grenzachenstrasse 124, Basel CH-4002, Switzerland; Fax:
011/410/616/911-111; and 340 Kingsland St., Nutley, NJ 07110; Tel:
201/235-5000, Fax: 201/235-7034).

Most likely to reach the market next is Ritonavir from Abbott
Laboratories (1 Abbott Park Road; Abbott Park, Illinois 60064-3500;
Tel: 708/937-6100, Fax: 708/937-2013). Abbott reports recent
results from a clinical trial showing this protease inhibitor
significantly reduced plasma viremia and elevated counts of CD4
lymphocytes.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals (40 Allston St., Cambridge, MA 02139; Tel:
617/576-3111, Fax: 617/576-2109), developing its own HIV protease
inhibitor, reports that its partner, Glaxo Wellcome (Berkeley Ave.,
Greenford, Middlesex UB6 OHE, U.K.; Fax: 071/493-4809), has
commenced Phase I/II clinical trials in the U.S. and Europe. This
effort is being supported also by Kissei Pharmaceutical (Matsumoto,
Japan).

Although monotherapy with one compound or another does a reasonable
job at keeping the virus at bay, it seems probable that combination
therapy with a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor and a protease
inhibitor will constitute the future direction of treatment. The
virus may develop a resistance toward one drug type, but it faces
a greater obstacle to its replication when confronted with both
types. It seems possible that while the RTIs will rise to perhaps
$500 million by 2000, for an average annual growth rate of 1.9% in
this five-year period, the PIs will rise rapidly from zero to $500
million themselves, before settling down to a more normal growth
rate.

Numerous other drugs, appproved or experimental, also treat AIDS or
AIDS-associated conditions. The short list includes gamma-globulin,
alpha-interferon, ganciclovir, fluconazole, pentamidine,
erythropoietin, foscarnet, itraconazole, atovaquone, rifabutin,
dronabinol, megestrol acetate, trimetrexate, clarithromycin,
trimethoprim, doxorubicin, and amphotericin B (see table)

To these can be added target-specific antibodies, antigen-based
vaccines, immune-boosting cytokines, immunomodutar chemcals, and
herbal medicines. Almost every biopharmaceutical and Big Pharma

Sepracor Makes
Improvements

Sepracor Inc. (33 Locke Drive, Marlborough, MA  01752;  Tel:
508/481-6700, Fax: 508/481-7683) has been granted its eleventh and
twelfth U.S. patents for Improved Chemical Entities (ICE).

U.S. Patent 5,470,868 covers the use of R-ondansetron as an
antiemetic.  Marketed by Glaxo Wellcome (Lansdowne House, Berkeley
Square, London W1X 6BZ, U.K.; Tel: 1714934060) as Zofran, racemic
ondansetron already is a leading antiemetic used to treat nausea
and vomiting associated with chemotherapy treatments and surgery.
Sepracor estimates that emesis occurs in 70% of the 3.6 million
chemotherapy episodes and 30% of the 23 million surgical procedures
performed in the U.S. each year.  The sales of Zofran in 1994 were
approximately $600 million.

Despite its effectiveness for emesis, racemic ondansetron has shown
a meaningful incidence of adverse side effects such as tachycardia,
angina, and electrocardiographic alterations, including second-
degree heart block most prevalent in nonchemotherapy uses.
Sepracor believes that the single isomer of ondansetron provides an
opportunity for development of a safer, more effective antiemetic.
Preclinical trials have indicated that R-ondansetron has superior
antiemetic activity compared with the racemic product.

In preclinical studies, Sepracor has discovered that a purified
version of itraconazole retains full antifungal activity with
reduced risk of drug-drug interaction.  Marketed by Janssen
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (1000 E. Garvey Ave. S., West Covina, CA
91790; Tel: 818/918-8510, Fax: 818/918-2862) as Sporanox,
itraconazole is a leading antifungal agent.  The product had 1994
worldwide sales of $276 million and is protected until June 1998
under its composition-of-matter patent.

Sporanox is a complex molecule consisting of several isomers.
Despite its effectiveness for treating fungal and yeast infections,
Sporanox carries a warning label about certain drug interactions
that cause adverse effects, such as cardiac arrhythmia, ventricular
tachycardia, and torsades de pointes.  Other adverse effects
include liver toxicity, nausea, vomiting, and hypersensitivity
reactions.  U.S. Patent 5,474,997 claims pharmaceutical
compositions containing (2R,4S)-itraconazole is a way of treating
local and systemic fungal and yeast infections while avoiding the
concomitant liability of adverse effects associated with the drug.

David S. Barlow, president of Sepracor Pharmaceuticals, said that
the improvement in safety profile may ultimately help enable the
switch of itraconazole from a prescription drug to an over-the-
counter product. That would help extend the franchise for the drug
and expand its market.

Sepracor additionally seeks to commercialize norastemizole, a
third-generation antihistamine and potentially improved allergy
therapy. Norastemizole is an active metabolite of astemizole, the
nonsedating antihistamine marketed by Janssen under the brand name
Hismanal. The astemizole product may produce cardiac arrhythmia,
however.  Preclinical studies by Sepracor indicate that
norastemizole may avoid this side effect.  The fact that
astemizole, as well as norastemizole, are nonchiral entities points
up that Sepracor does not deal exclusively with chiral molecules.

(R)-Lomefloxacin
Eliminates Headaches

James W. Young of Sepracor Inc. (33 Locke Drive, Marlborough, MA
01752;  Tel: 508/481-6700, Fax: 508/481-7683) has been issued a
patent for methods and compositions that treat bacterial infection
using optically pure (R)-lomefloxacin (U. S. 5,476,854). Optical
purity is important since certain isomers may actually be
deleterious rather than simply inert. For example, it has been
suggested that the D-enantiomer of thalidomide was a safe and
effective sedative when prescribed for the control of morning
sickness during pregnancy, and the corresponding L-enantiomer was
a potent teratogen.

It has been discovered that the optically pure (R)-isomer of
lomefloxacin is effective in treating infection in a human while
avoiding adverse effects associated with the administration of
racemic lomefloxacin, including headache, stomach discomfort,
gastrointestinal disorders, hypoglycemia, renal and hepatic
dysfunction, allergic reactions and respiratory distress, and
arthropathy, such as cartilage lesions and erosion and
abnormalities in bone growth in immature patients.

Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e. they
have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In
describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R
and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule
about its chiral center(s).  A specific stereoisomer may be
referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is
often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of
enantiomers if referred to as a racemic mixture.

Stereochemical purity is of importance in the field of
pharmaceuticals, where 12 of the 20 most prescribed drugs exhibit
chirality. A case in point is provided by the L-form of the b-
adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol, which is known to be 100
times more potent than the D-enantiomer.

Sepracor's development includes methods for treating the above-
described conditions in a human while avoiding the adverse effects
that are associated with the racemic mixture of lomefloxacin by
administering the optically pure (R)-isomer of lomefloxacin.

Lomefloxacin is currently available commercially in Argentina,
Japan, Mexico, and other countries in Asia and Eastern Europe as
the racemic mixture.  Racemic lomefloxacin, having the chemical
name 1-ethyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(3-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-
oxo-3-quinolinecar-boxylic acid, belongs to the quinoline class of
antibiotics. The quinoline antibiotics, in general, exhibit a broad
spectrum of antibacterial action, demonstrating effectiveness
against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains.

Quinoline antibiotics have been shown to be effective in treating
infections of the respiratory, genito-urinary, and gastrointestinal
tracts.  Racemic lomefloxacin exhibits a broad spectrum of
antibacterial action, demonstrating effectiveness against both
gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Lomefloxacin has
shown to be more effective against gram-negative bacteria.

Ketoprofen Gains
Market Share

The chiral drug, ketoprofen, sold under the Orudis KT brand name by
the Whitehall-Robins Healthcare Division of American Home Products
(5 Giralda Farms, Madison, NJ 07940; Tel: 201/660-5000), has
achieved a 3.7% share of the $2.75 billion OTC pain reliever market
in the U.S., according to A.C. Nielson. The survey covers just the
two-month period ended Dec. 16, since introduction of the product
on Nov. 9. The share figure translates into sales of $102,000,
which comes to $610,000 on an annualized basis, although it's too
early to foretell the actual full-year performance.

To achieve even this modest share so quickly, Whitehall-Robins
undertook the largest overnight delivery of new medication to
retail stores it has ever made.  In a 24-hour, nationwide
distribution effort, more than 20,000 trucks were mobilized to
deliver the Orudis KT to more than 30,000 retail outlets. Retailers
apparently confirm the product's market acceptance. Says John
Spellman, analgesic category manager of American Drug Stores,
"Orudis KT has made a surprisingly strong, early impact on the
over-the-counter pain-relief category at [the company's] stores."

Meanwhile, the consumer Care Division of Bayer (1 Mellon Bank
Center, 500 Grant St., Pittsburgh, PA 15219; Tel: 412/394-5500,
Fax: 412/394-5586) has entered the arena, with its Actron brand of
ketoprofen. Although the tablet has the same strength as American
Home Product's Orudis, Bayer's advertising campaign will emphasize
Actron's smaller tablet size. Promotion of Actron will include
newspaper displays in the top 20 markets and television
advertising. As Gary Balkema, president of Bayer Consumer Care
says, "The powerful medicine in Actron delivers safe and effective
relief of many types of pain.  And its unique size offers a new,
tangible benefit for consumers: it's very easy to swallow."

Ketoprofen chemically is in the same class as ibuprofen and
naproxen, a 2-substituted propionic acid that gives the molecule
its chiral character.

Motilin Focus of
Two-Pronged Effort

Motilin is a recently discovered peptide hormone found in the
gastrointestinal tract and has a molecular weight of around 2,700
daltons.  Its function is to stimulate gastric movement.  Efforts
to imitate and to suppress motilin's action is the subject of drug
development by several companies.

In one recent development, Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho (35 Higashi,
Sotobori-cho, Higashi-ku. Nagoya 461, Japan; Fax: 052/951-7650), a
relatively small pharmaceutical firm, has developed an orally
absorbable form of motilin. Instead of the natural molecule, Sanwa
uses a derivative, L-leucine-13-motilin-homoserine.  The agent's
formulation includes a special surfactant that includes a bile
salt, a saponin, and a polyethylene glycol/higher alcohol ether.
The surfactant acts as an inhibitor of peptide cleaving enzymes.

Too much gastrointestinal activity can be as bad as too little, and
it commonly manifests itself as "nervous stomach" -- diarrhea and
the like. The pharmaceutical division of BOC's subsidiary, Ohmeda
(110 Allen Road, Liberty Corner, NJ 07938; Tel: 908/647-9200, Fax:
908/647-9245) has invented motilin analogs that antagonize the
hormone's receptor and thereby inhibits gastrointestinal motor
activity.

The analogs are optically active isomers of the amino acids that
make up motilin, but some have the D instead of the natural L
configuration, e.g. D-arginine, D-lysine, D-ornithine, D-glutamine,
D-asparagine, or D-alanine. Unnatural amino acids also may be part
of the composition, e.g. D-2,4-diaminobutyric acid, a
halophenylalanine, and cyclohexylalanine.

Ergo Uses Ergot
for Diabetes

Ergo Science Corp. (Boston, MA; Tel: 617/241-6816) finds that
bromocriptine, an ergot alkaloid derivative having five chiral
centers, can benefit in the treatment of Type II diabetes.  The
formulated product, brand-named Ergoset, is currently in Phase III
clinical trials.

In an animal study using seasonally obese, hyperinsulinemic Syrian
hamsters, a carefully timed administration of bromocriptine
produced a significant reduction in noctural lipolysis and hepatic
glucose production accompanied by a 75% decrease in circulating
insulin and improved daytime glucose tolerance.  Timed
bromocriptine may improve glucose tolerance by inhibiting lipolysis
and free fatty acid oxidation through a central and possibly
peripheral effect that increases the ratio of dopamine to
noradrenaline activity. An increasing body of evidence points to
the influence of circadian rhythm on human metabolism.

Bromocriptine already has medical use as an anti-Parkinson's
disease drug, e.g. Sandoz's Parlodel, where the substance acts as
a dopamine receptor agonist. The substance also inhibits the
secretion of prolactin, a hormone that stimulates milk production.

Enantiomeric Sertraline
Synthesized by Pfizer

Pfizer markets sertraline under the brand name Zoloft.  It is an
antidepressant drug and, in fact, is one of the top-selling ones,
with worldwide sales in the area of $720 million annually.

The company has devised a new multistep process for synthesizing
sertraline that involves first synthesizing the (4S) enantiomer of
4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-1(2H)-naphthalenone in high optical
purity. The process starts with the familiar 4-(3,4-
dichlorophenyl)-4-ketobutanoic acid, then proceeds through an
esterification with isopropyl or tert-butyl alcohol, a reduction of
the keto to hydroxy (creating the 4R configuration), and ultimately
yielding the key (4S) naphthalenone intermediate.

Subsequent transformations of the intermediate finally yield cis-
(1S)(4S)-N-methyl-4-(3-,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3-4-tetrahydro-1-
naphthaleneamine, in other words, sertraline.

SmithKline Produces
Camptothecin Analogs

Camptothecin is an alkaloid originating from the Chinese tree,
Camptotheca acuminata, and chemically it is 4-ethyl-4-hydroxy-1H-
pyrano-[3',4':6,7]indolizinol[1,2-b]quinoline-3,14(4H, 12H)-dione.
The substance has anticancer activity by virtue of its acting as an
inhibitor of topoisomerase I, also called "DNA-relaxing enzyme."
This enzyme uncoils double-helix DNA, the first step in replication
of the genetic material during the process of cellular
proliferation.

SmithKline Beecham (1 Franklin Plaza, Philadelphia, PA 19101; Tel:
215/751-4000) is clinically evaluating camptothecin relatives for
breast and colon cancers, and one such compound has the designation
SKF-104864. The company describes a process for the asymmetric
total synthesis of camptothecin analogs.

In the process, a cis-dioxolanone having the same desired absolute
configuration as the end compound is converted to a diester in a
way that conserves the chirality.  This substance then is converted
to one bearing either a good leaving group, a cyano, a carboxylic
acid, or an N-aryl carboxylic amide.  This is converted to a
compound incorporating a propargyl or substituted propargyl, which
finally is converted to the end camptothecin analog.

The chief rival to SB in this arena is Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, which
has in clinical development a camptothecin analog, called
irinotecan and  brand-named Campto, the company licensed from
Yakult Honsha.  The latter also licensed Upjohn, which uses the
brand name Camptosar for the same compound.

Oxazolidinones Show
Diabetes Potential

Celgene (7 Powder Horn Drive, Warren, NJ 07059; Tel: 908/271-1001,
Fax: 908/271-4184) sees potential in oxazolidinones as therapeutic
agents for diabetes and hyperglycemia. The company developed a
stereopreferential synthesis of the (R,R) diastereoisomers of 3-(1-
phenylprop-2-yl)-5-phenyloxazolidin-2-ones as intermediates for the
final compounds.

The method starts with a reduction of the addition salt of an (R)-
N-protected-N-phenylcarboxymethyl-1-phenylprop-2-ylamine to form a
secondary alcohol of predominantly the desired enantiomeric
configuration at the two chiral centers. The next step is a removal
of the protecting group that forms a secondary amine.  Then the
secondary amine is reacted with a carbonyl source. The overall
process results in a chemical purity and an optical purity both in
excess of 99%.

Chemical drugs other than insulin for the control of diabetes and
hyperglycemia has combined worldwide sales of perhaps $3.5 billion
annually, at present. The major fraction of these sales come from
sulfonylurea drugs. They are under challenge by new contenders
because of their tendency to produce hypoglycemia, a serious
problem of its own.

UOP Provides
Good Yield

David W. House of UOP (E. Algonquin Road, Des Plaines, IL  60017;
Tel: 708/391-3963,  Fax: 708/391-3804) has worked out a way to
conveniently racemize benzyl alcohols having a chiral center at the
benzylic carbon by treatment with solid acids that are strongly
acidic cation-exchange materials (U.S. Patent 5,476,964).

It has been known for some time that for medicinals having at least
one chiral center the pharmacological effectiveness of the
enantiomers of the racemic mixture may substantially differ.
Although the recognition of the desirability of using the
pharmacologically and pharmaceutically more acceptable enantiomer
is old, nonetheless the use of optically pure medicinals generally
is relatively new, simply because of the difficulty and cost of
resolution of the racemic mixture and/or the difficulty and cost of
asymmetric synthesis of the desired enantiomer.

With modern chemical advances, especially in asymmetric synthesis,
has come both an increase in the feasibility of selectively
preparing the more acceptable enantiomer of a given chiral
medicinal, as well as increasing pressure on the pharmaceutical
industry to make available only that enantiomer. An instructive
example, pertinent to the subject matter of this invention, is the
class of serotonin-uptake inhibitors exemplified by fluoxetine
(whose racemate is available as Prozac), tomoxetine, and
nisoxetine.

Enantioselective synthesis depends on chiral reagents of high
enantiomeric purity that can be quite expensive. Consequently,
another general approach is based on the efficient resolution of an
early precursor, used as a raw starting material in synthesis, with
high enantiomeric purity, followed by subsequent conventional
synthetic techniques that maintain high enantiomeric purity in
intermediates through final product formation.

When one enantiomer is more desirable than the other in practice
only the more desirable enantiomer will be utilized in subsequent
synthesis. Unless one is willing to accept the economic burden of
discarding the less desirable (or even undesirable) enantiomer --
which is half of the starting material -- it is imperative to
somehow recycle the undesired enantiomer. This application is
directed precisely to this need to afford a cost-effective solution
to the preceding problem.

Racemization of benzyl alcohols may be effected generally in the
range from 20-150C in aqueous or partly aqueous systems in
combination with a water-miscible organic solvent to improve
solubility of the alcohol. Similar racemizations may be effected
for benzyl ethers and esters. This process is valuable for
recycling of unwanted enantiomers obtained in the resolution of
racemic mixtures.   The purpose of this invention is to racemized
benzylic alcohols, ethers, and esters, especially in a continuous
process, with high specificity and good yield.

Supercritical Fluids
Yield Higher Purity

Chemists at Duke University (Durham, NC) have teamed up with Los
Alamos National Laboratory (Los Alamos, NM) to get high
enantiomeric purities without resorting to toxic solvents.  The
scientists find that they are able to get as great or greater
enantiomeric excesses by catalytic hydrogenation in supercritical
carbon dioxide as in organic solvents.

Above its critical temperature of 31C, nonflammable, non-toxic
carbon dioxide is compressible to densities of 0.5 g/ml, meaning
that users can vary solvent properties by manipulating pressure.
Organic chemistry professor Mark J. Burk and coworkers reported in
the Journal of the American Chemical Society [117, 8277, 1995] on
the hydrogenation of substituted a-acetaminoacrylic acid to
substituted N-acetylalanines in carbon dioxide at 5,000 psig total
pressure and 40C with an asymmetric diphosphine-rhodium catalyst.

The team was able to get 88.4% enantiomeric excess of a-acetamin-
oisobutyric acid, the highest ever achieved from the acrylic acid
precursor.

Fredericamycin A
Is Scripps First

Scientists at the Scripps Research Institute (Claremont, CA) have
achieved the first total synthesis of both enantiomers of the
antitumor-anitbiotic agent fredericamycin A. While the natural
product exhibits potent in vitro cytotoxic activity and has shown
antitumor activity in vivo, not much is known about its site of
action or the structural features responsible for its activity.  In
an effort to identify the origin of its biological properties, Dale
Boger, Ottmar Hter, Kapiamba Mbiya, and Minsheng Zhang of Scripts
accomplished a convergent total synthesis of its two enantiomers.

As reported in the Journal of the American Chemical Society [117,
11839, 1995], the scientists used a Michael addition to add the DE
ring system to an F ring precursor, a benzannulation reaction to
construct the AB moiety, and then an aldol closure reaction to
close the C ring in between.

This research complements earlier attempts at total syntheses of
racemic fredericamycin A by other groups.  Boger and coworkers
found that natural fredericamycin A and its enantiomer exhibit
essentially equivalent cytotoxic activity.  This comparable
cytotoxic potency should permit the use of the two enantiomers in
distinguishing the site and potential mechanism of action of
fredericamycin A.

USC Characterizes
Stable Tetracation

Chemists at the University of Southern California (Los Angeles, CA)
have prepared and characterized the first stable tetrahedrally
oriented tetracation.  The synthesis was carried out by
postdoctoral associate Nicholas Head, working with chemistry
professors G. K. Surya Prakash and George Olah.

As reported in the Journal of the American Chemical Society [117,
12005, 1995], an adamantane tetrahedrally substituted with four
ester groups was first converted to a tetraol.  The tetraol is then
ionized to the tetracation under superacid conditions at -80C.
The tetracation is stable up to -40C.

Tetracations are very rare and long-lived tetracarbocations that
were previously unknown.  According to Prakash, the researchers
hope to use the tetracation to catalyze the polymerization of other
molecules to yield hyper-branched polymers.  They see the potential
for using the tetracation as a building block in the construction
of self-assembling supramolecular structures.

PerSeptive Introduces
New PNA Chemistry

Peptide and oligonucleotide synthesis chemistry comprise a bedrock
of chiral technology applications, for both research molecules and
potential therapeutics.  A new development is the emergence of
"peptide nucleic acids (PNA)," a hybrid type that uses a peptide-
like backbone with nucleotide pendants. Such hybrid molecules have
the complementary binding capabilities of oligonucleotides for
nucleic acid sequences, but resist the degradative action of
nuclease enzymes.

PerSeptive Biosystems (500 Old Connecticut Path, Framingham, MA
01701; Tel: 508/383-7700, Fax: 508/383-7851) introduces a new line
of products for the synthesis of peptide nucleic acids.
Applications include affinity purification, in situ  hybridization,
enhanced PCR, improved Southern blots, single-point mutation
analysis, and antisense research.

The chemistry employs new monomers with Fmoc (9-
flurenylmethoxycarbonyl) and Bhoc (benzhydryloxycarbonyl)
protecting groups. Syntheses are run on solid-phase supports using
mild conditions and automated instrumentation. PerSeptive has
applied for a patent on its new class of PNA synthons. Says Michael
Eghold, director of PNA research at PerSeptive, "PNA is now being
used in over 100 labs worldwide as a tool for molecular biology and
diagnostic research and functions in very different ways from any
previous molecule."

Having taken over the Biosearch Milligen business from Millipore in
August 1994, PerSeptive is now the second leading supplier of
materials for peptide and oligonucleotide chemical synthesis. It
also supplies the synthesis equipment.

Arrhythmia Drug
Uses Bioreduction

Merck is developing a new drug for cardiac arrhythmia, designated
MK499.  Its production makes use of an asymmetric bioreduction, by
which 6-bromotetralone converts to (S)-6-bromo-2tetraol.  The
reductive activity is furnished by the yeast Trichosporon captatum
MY-1890 (ATCC 74312) which, along with the substrate for
conversion, is cultivated in a medium incorporating glycerol, soy
peptone, and yeast extract.  An optical purity greater than 98% is
obtained.

Arrhythmia is an irregularity of the heart beat. A cluster of
specialized cells, located at the junction of the superior vena
cava and the high right atrium, called the sinoatrial (or sinus)
node, forms the pacemaker of the heart. These cells produce a
rhythmic electrical discharge that initiates the regular
contraction of the heart muscle, which in turn forces (pumps) the
circulation of blood. The sinoatrial cells are modulated by
autonomic nerves and by circulating catecholamines.

Antiarrhythmic drugs to regularize the heart beat had worldwide
sales in 1995 of about $900 million. The Group I antiarrhythmics,
which behave as sodium channel antagonists, have about an 89% share
of this market, while calcium channel blockers, potassium channel
blockers, beta blockers, and miscellaneous others comprise the rest
of the antiarrhythmics.

Process Not Picky
About Enzymes

Researchers at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (345 Park Ave., New York,
NY 10154-0004; Tel: 212/546-4000) have refined a method of chiral
epoxidation of benzopyran or pyranopyridine derivatives using
microorganisms (U.S. Patent 5,478,734). The enzymatic epoxidation
process is advantageous in that it provides high yields of the
chiral epoxides of the compounds with high optical purity.

The invention is a novel process for preparing a chiral epoxide
and/or a (+)-trans dihydroxy compound.  The process comprises the
step of treating a compound with an enzyme or microorganism capable
of catalyzing the stereoselective epoxidation of the compounds to
form the chiral epoxide or the stereoselective hydroxylation to
form the chiral dihydroxy compound.

It has been found that in the presence of one or more epoxidizing
enzymes or microorganisms producing epoxidizing enzymes, the
stereoselective epoxidation of the compounds is achieved. When the
reaction is carried out at ambient temperature, for example, an
optical purity of greater than about 80% may be obtained with a
reaction yield of greater than about 50%. Preferably, an optical
purity of greater than 85% with a reaction yield of greater than
about 60% may be obtained.

In addition to the chiral epoxide, the method comprises the
stereoselective hydroxylation of compounds to produce the chiral
trans-dihydroxy compounds.  The chiral dihydroxy compounds may be
prepared from the racemic trans diols by treatment of the racemic
trans diols with lipase, esterase, or microorganism capable of
supplying lipase or esterase.

Any enzyme or microorganism having the ability to catalyze the
stereoselective epoxidation or stereoselective hydroxylation of the
compounds as described may be employed in the processes. Two or
more -- as well as single -- species of microorganism may be
employed.  Various enzymes, regardless of origin or purity, are
suitable for usefor example, the enzymes may be in the form of
animal or plant enzymes or mixtures thereof, cells of
microorganisms, crushed cells, extracts of cells, or of synthetic
origin.  The use of genetically engineered organisms is being
contemplated.

Hoechst Makes
A Fast Switch

Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft (Frankfurt, Germany) researcher Javier
Manero has invented a process for preparing highly pure enantiomers
of oxirane alcohols (U.S. Patent 5,478,954)  The process involves
recrystallizing a mixture of the isomeric oxirane alcohols, in
which the desired enantiomer is present in an excess of at least
60%, in a solvent or solvent mixture at a temperature just below
the melting point of the oxirane alcohol.  Oxirane alcohols
prepared according to the invention are distinguished by high
enantiomeric purity.

For almost 150 years, chemists have endeavored to produce chiral
compounds in the form of largely pure enantiomers, either by
synthesis of a single enantiomer or by separation of the two
enantiomers. Chiral compounds are in general optically active, i.e.
they rotate the plane of polarized light by a certain amount. This
amount is of the same magnitude for the two enantiomers but has
different signs.

Particularly in the field of biochemistry, it is known that only
one of the two enantiomers usually shows a certain given activity,
even when the two can have completely different activities. In many
other fields of chemistry and industry it is important to work with
enantiomeric compounds that are as pure as possible. Examples
include plant-protection chemicals and ferroelectric liquid
crystals, i.e. those which contain chiral molecules and form tilted
smectic phases.

Clark and Lagerwall have been able to show that the use of
ferroelectric liquid-crystal systems in very thin cells leads to
optoelectric switching or indicating elements that, as compared
with the conventional twisted nematic (TN) cells, have switching
times that are shorter by a factor of up to 1000.  The optical
switching time of ferroelectric liquid-crystal systems depends on
the rotational viscosity of the system on the spontaneous
polarization and the electric field strength.

It is also known to obtain pure enantiomers of compounds by adding
seed crystals of the desired enantiomer to the solution of the two
enantiomers. This so-called spontaneous resolution of racemates
succeeds only if the racemic mixture crystallizes as a
conglomerate, i.e. as a mixture of crystals of one enantiomer in
each case, which is the case for only a few compounds.  It was a
goal at Hoechst to provide a process to more easily obtain oxirane
alcohols of an even higher purity of the enantiomers.

Hoechst found, surprisingly, that oxirane alcohols without
detectable contamination by the other diastereomers or enantiomers
can be obtained by recrystallization in suitable solvents at
temperatures that are just below the melting point of the oxirane
alcohol. The interval between the melting point and the temperature
of the recrystallization can be the wider, the higher the melting
point of the compound.

Continuous Sampling
Elucidates Absorptions

The University of Kansas (Lawrence, KS) has developed an interface
for use with a multiple-sample acquisition device and a capillary
electrophoresis separation device (U.S. Patent 5,449,064). The use
of continuous sampling can permit the user to better elucidate the
pathways and kinetics of absorption of a particular compound of
interest to determine how the compound is transformed within the
body and to determine the rate at which the compound is eliminated
from the living organism. This information is often necessary to
permit the researcher to fully assess the safety of both
pharmaceutical and environmental compounds.

One might desire information about the reaction of an analgesic
chiral compound in a living organism. To determine this, a known
amount of the compound could be given to the organism, and
continuous tissue samples (e.g., brain fluid) are obtained. By
analyzing the brain fluid samples that were withdrawn at various
time intervals after giving the analgesic to the animal, one could
obtain a great deal of information about the manner in which the
specific analgesic functioned within the living organism.

By continuously obtaining samples, it is also possible to determine
the amount of time required to remove the particular analgesic
system from the living organism. Knowing the rate of elimination of
the analgesic can be especially important for enabling its
manufacturer to either adjust the dosage or alter the drug (such as
through micro encapsulation) to enable the drug to achieve a proper
titer within the living organism for a proper time period.

One goal when performing continuous or semi-continuous sampling is
to improve the temporal resolution of the sampling and detection
process. Temporal resolution relates to the number of data points
that one can obtain over a given time span. Figures for temporal
resolution are typically given in units of time span. To say that
a particular experiment had a temporal resolution of 1 minute means
that a data point was taken (or capable of being taken) each
minute. The factor limiting temporal resolution is the time
required to accumulate and collect a sample of a size adequate for
the particular detection method being used in conjunction with the
sampling.

Methods for obtaining time-interval type, sequential multiple-
sample chemical information from tissues of living systems have
usually involved either a postmortem analysis taken at several time
points or the use of biosensors implanted in vivo. Postmortem
analyses typically require the use of a large number of animals
with only a single sample being taken from each animal. The "pseudo
continuity" of samples is achieved by taking the samples from the
different animals at different points in time.

The use of postmortem analyses to construct a temporal plot of
chemical events is difficult and often provides ambiguous results.
While several compounds can be determined at each time point (and
hence from each sample), each animal can provide data for only a
single time point. It is therefore preferable in terms of both the
quality of data obtained and the number of experimental animals
needed that the entire time course (data set) be obtained from one
animal by taking a large number of samples over a span of time.
Although this can be accomplished through the use of a biosensor,
biosensors suffer the drawback of providing less chemical
information since they are usually limited to monitoring only a
single chemical species.

To overcome the sampling difficulties, some researchers use a
microdialysis sampling technique. Microdialysis sampling is
accomplished by implanting a microdialysis probe that consists of
a small, semi-permeable membrane fiber at the site of interest.
This fiber is slowly perfused with a sampling solution. The
semipermeable microdialysis membrane allows certain molecules of
interest to pass from the animal into the sampling solution.

Small molecules in the extra-cellular space can diffuse into the
microdialysis membrane fiber and are swept away by the sampling
solution to be collected for analysis. Microdialysis probes can be
implanted in many tissues with minimal discomfort to the
experimental animal.  A limitation of microdialysis has been the
limited temporal resolution that has been achievable to date. While
microdialysis is a continuous sampling technique, it is typically
coupled to a separation method that requires discrete samples.

Beckman's New
Analysis Method

The rapid analysis-time characteristic of capillary electrophoresis
(CE) has allowed Beckman Instruments (2500 Harbor Blvd., Fullerton,
CA  92634; Tel: 800/742-2345 or 714/871-4848,  Fax: 714/870-8083)
to develop an easy-to-use, ultrafast chiral separation method for
the analysis of optically active drugscyclodextrin-array chiral
analysis.

Andras Guttman, Anthony Aumatel, Sandy Brunet, and Nelson Cooke of
Beckman reported the results of separations utilizing the new
method in American Laboratory [27, 18, 1995]. Earlier, STN
(November 1995) reported on Beckman's integrated capilllary
electrophoresis system that uses special software for computer-
based analysis of the data.

Cyclodextrin-mediated capillary electrophoresis of enantiomers was
first introduced by employing several native cyclodextrins
entrapped in polyacrylamide gels.  Later, a similar methodology in
an open tubular-separation mode was applied.  Natural a-, b-, and
g-cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides of 6, 7, and 8
glucopyranose units, respectively.  The diameter and volume of the
DC cavity are determined by the number of glucose units in the CD
ring.

The most energetically stable form of this ring structure resembles
a truncated cone in aqueous solution with the linking glycosidic
and glucopyranose oxygens pointing inward and the C-6 hydroxyls
opposite to the C-2 and C-3 hydroxyls.  As a result, the chemical
characteristics of the cavity are determined by the hydrogens
projecting into the cavity and the nonbonding pair of electrons
contributed by each of the ring-forming oxygens.

To obtain chiral separation with CD, it is necessary for different
interactions to take place between the enantiomer and the CD.
These interactions are as follows:  electrostatic, dipole-dipole,
inductive, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions.  If at
least one of these interactions is stereochemically dependent,
chiral separation of an enantiomeric solute is possible.

Recently, a rational approach to predicting the electrophoretic
mobility differences for enantiomers of weak acids and bases in CE
using different natural and derivatized CDs as chiral selectors was
introduced.  Three types of CD-based chiral CE separations were
identified, differentiated by the selective interaction of the
ionic/nonionic forms of the enantiomer.

In desionoselective separation, selective interaction occurs only
between the nondissociated form of the enantiomer and the CD.  In
ionoselective separation, selective interaction occurs only with
the dissociated form of the enantiomer.  In duoselective
separation, selective interaction occurs with both the charged and
uncharged forms of the enantiomer.

CD-array chiral analysis uses an array of chiral selectors, such as
b-, g-, hydroxypropyl-b-, and dimethyl-b-DCs, in various
concentrations to accommodate different types of solutes.  After
the application of the CD array on CE, the appropriate CD type is
usually identified in conjunction with the suitable pH.  Other,
more typical CE separation parameters, such as field strength and
temperature, can be varied in order to influence the separation
efficiency and, thus, resolution.

Chiroscience Blends
Chemistry, Enzymes

Chiroscience Ltd. (Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge
CB4 4WE, U.K.; Tel: 44/01/223-420430, Fax: 44/01/223-420440) makes
the claim of being the world's leading chiral technology company.
At the very least, it is one of the larger companies specializing
in this field. The company was founded by Chris Evans and is headed
by Nowell Stebbing.  Andrew Headland is the marketing manager, and
Joe Carey runs international collaborations.

The company has a willingness to employ both chemical reagents and
enzymes to make chiral compounds.  Moreover, it is wedded to
neither resolution nor asymmetric synthesis, accepting both
approaches to the furnishing of enantiomers. The company, however,
does regard itself as a pharmaceutical firm, excluding other
applications of chiral technology from its portfolio of interests.

Recently, Chiroscience acquired a license to phospholane asymmetric
hydrogenation catalysts from Du Pont.  Hydrogenation is one of the
most common reactions in preparative chemistry. The company notes
that rhodium complexes of Du Pont's DuPhos ligand family have
applicability to obtaining single-enantiomer amino acids by an
asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral enamides.

The reductions have high turnovers of catalyst, a low requirement
of hydrogen pressure, stereoconvergent  transformation of Z/E
mixtures, and high enantiomeric excesses. The phospholane catalysts
were discovered by Mark Burk at Du Pont, and he continues to work
at Duke University (North Carolina).  His latest advance is the
hydrogenation of b,b-disubstituted enamides in a medium of
supercritical carbon dioxide, giving the highest enantiomeric
excesses so far attained for the reduction of such tetrasubstituted
olefins.

Chiroscience also licenses ligands from Professor Barry Trost at
Stanford University (Palo Alto, CA), which the company uses for
palladium catalysts to promote asymmetric allylic substitution
reactions, for instance, the generation of carbovir (an antiviral)
and aristeromycin. The Trost catalysts can also be used to convert
allylic carbonates and acetates into useful synthons by reaction
with nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles, providing
access to a wide range of chiral cyclic molecules. Either
enantiomer can be produced.

Unnatural amino acids are of increasing importance as components of
therapeutic peptides, by modifying the receptor selectivity of the
peptide, and by enhancing its metabolic resistance to degradation
or by improving its bioavailability.  Chiroscience has developed a
"one-pot" route to unnatural amino acids using an immobilized
acylase for the resolution of the BOC derivative.  The unwanted
isomer recovered after the resolution is racemized and put back
into the process stream. The company now seeks to apply this method
to the production of cyclic amino acids as analogs of proline or
pipecolic acid.

When a D-acetyl amino acid is racemized with acetic anhydride, an
azlactone is formed as an intermediate.  This intermediate
spontaneously racemizes via its achiral enol tautomer, but
azlactones also can be biotransformed.  For instance,  the
introduction of n-butanol into  tert-leucine azolactone  using a
lipase takes place only on the L isomer, but the D isomer
spontaneous racemizes, channeling all the material toward the L in
a process known as "dynamic resolution.  Additionally, when
azlactones are made by condensation of an N-acyl glycine (such as
hippuric acid) with an aldehyde, the resulting olefins can be
opened to enamides, which then serve as substrates for the DuPhos
hydrogenation.

The g-lactam synthon (-)-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one is an
intermediate for the synthesis of carbocyclic nucleosides having
the same configuration as the natural ones they mimic.
Chiroscience's chemistry has the capability of producing not only
the lactam but also more advanced downstream intermediates.  The
company uses a proprietary resolution methodology based on
enantiocomplementary biotransformations by lactamases selected by
screening microorganisms of the natural environment.  Applying this
process ultimately results in at least a 20,000- fold improvement
in biocatalyst cost relative to early biocatalysts.

Among the pharmaceutical compounds for which Chiroscience has
developed production methods are a protein kinase C inhibitor, an
immunosuppressant, a k-opioid analgesic, and a dopaminergic
agonist.

SUIT ALLEGES AEC RAN
SECRET RADIATION TESTS
ON OREGON PRISON INMATES

     A class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Oregon Dec. 5 alleges that 67 Oregon state prison
inmates were the subjects of risky and painful government
experiments in the 1960s to study the effects of ionizing
radiation on the human body.  Bibeau v. Pacific Northwest
Research Foundation Inc. et al., No. 95-06410-HO (D OR).

     The inmates consented to the experiments, which involved x-
ray irradiation of their sex organs, but the defendants conspired
to conceal from them the true nature of the research and the
risks involved, the complaint charges.

     Harold Bibeau, an inmate at Oregon State Penitentiary in
Salem, OR, from 1963 to 1969, and his wife Melanie Ann, filed the
complaint on behalf of three classes of alleged victims: the 67
inmates who were subjected to the experiments, their family
members and any children who were conceived after the subjects
were irradiated.

     Named as defendants are two laboratories, the Pacific
Northwest Research Foundation Inc. (PNRF) and Battelle Pacific
Northwest Laboratories; two medical doctors who were employed by
the Oregon Department of Corrections, Dr. Daniel E. Dilaconi and
Dr. Fernando Leon; a PNRF employee, Mavis Rowley, and four
officials of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), the forerunner
to the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which
allegedly funded and oversaw the experiments.

     According to the complaint, the prison experiments (called
the Heller experiments after chief researcher Dr. Carl Heller,
now deceased) were undertaken after a 1962 accident at the
Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Richland, WA, exposed workers to
significant amounts of ionizing radiation.

     The AEC wanted to study the short- and long-term effects of
ionizing radiation on spermatogenesis among the workers and also
to investigate the effects of long-term exposure on pilots of a
then-proposed nuclear-powered airplane (which was never
developed), the complaint charges.

     The Heller experiments involved irradiating the inmates'
testes with eight to 600 rads of radiation over 10 years from
1963 to 1973.  Periodically, the researchers gathered blood,
urine and semen from the inmates and also performed biopsies and
vasectomies on them.

     The defendants knew that the experiments subjected the
inmates to prolonged pain, increased their risks of developing
cancer and other serious illnesses, and caused radiation sickness
and burns and chromosomal damage that may affect the health of
children conceived after the testing.  They conspired to conceal
those risks from the test subjects, the complaint charges.

     Bibeau claims he and the other inmates were thus deprived of
the opportunity to give their informed consent and that the
prison environment and the large monetary compensation the
inmates were given relative to their regular prison compensation
were inherently coercive.

     He alleges violations of civil and constitutional rights,
intentional infliction of physical harm and emotional distress,
strict liability, personal injury, absence of informed consent,
loss of consortium, negligence, gross negligence, breach of
fiduciary duty, conspiracy, fraudulent concealment and failure to
provide ongoing medical monitoring.  The complaint also states a
claim pursuant to Bivens (Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of
the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 [1971]) because it
alleges that government officials (the AEC defendants) and
private parties illegally conspired to cause injuries to the
plaintiffs.

     Bibeau is seeking compensatory damages of $50 million and
punitive damages of $200 million, medical monitoring of the
inmates and any children conceived after the experiments,
interest and attorneys' fees and costs.

     The plaintiffs are represented by Daniel Berger, Stanley
Siegel, Bernadette M. Rappold and Eric L. Cramer of Berger and
Montague, Philadelphia; E. Cooper Brown and H.W. Cummins of
Tacoma Park, MD; Martin H. Freeman of Bethesda, MD; and Raymond
J. Heslin and Leonard M. Marks of New York City.  They are also
represented by Jerry S. Cohen and Anthony Z. Roisman of Cohen,
Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, Washington, DC; and by Roy S. Haber,
Eugene, OR.

DEATH BENEFIT AWARDED
FOR ETS EXPOSURE
AT VA HOSPITAL

     A federal Department of Labor claims examiner in Cleveland
on Dec. 8 awarded death benefits to the husband of a Veterans
Administration nurse, who claimed that his wife died of lung
cancer from exposure to cigarette smoke while caring for mentally
ill veterans.  In re Mildred Wiley, No. A9-365951 (U.S. Dept. of
Labor, Office of Workers' Comp. Programs).

     The decision is believed to be the first award of benefits
for a workplace injury attributed to environmental tobacco smoke
(ETS).

     The claim was brought by Philip E. Wiley of Marion, IN, who
claimed that his wife, Mildred, died as the result of exposure to
ETS during the course of her employment at the VA Medical Center
in Marion, where she worked for 18 years.  Mildred Wiley died at
the age of 56, one month after being diagnosed with lung cancer
in 1991.

     Wiley contended that his wife's only exposure to cigarette
smoke was during her work at the hospital.

     Wiley's claim was denied twice, once in 1992 and again in
1993, on grounds that the causal relationship between Mildred
Wiley's cancer and her ETS workplace exposure had not been
established.

     The claim was resubmitted in December 1994 by Wiley's
attorneys, Joseph Young and William N. Riley of Young & Riley in
Indianapolis, and was accompanied by a report from Dr. David M.
Burns, a University of San Diego medical professor who has
testified in several tobacco cases.

     According to the compensation order issued by Cynthia F.
Bujakowski, Labor Department reconsideration claims examiner,
Burns said that based on a review of the entire record, "Mildred
Wiley's adenocarcinoma of the lung, and the carcinogenic process
itself, was significantly aggravated and accelerated by her
exposure to ETS at her worksite."

     Burns also noted that neither Mildred Wiley, her husband,
family or friends smoked cigarettes and that she avoided ETS in
public and social situations.  Also, Burns said, Mildred Wiley
regularly worked in an environment where ETS was commonly present
at levels where the tobacco smoke was easily visible or
perceptible.

     Burns said that "tobacco smoke is the only proven human lung
carcinogen that [Mildred Wiley] was exposed to at a substantial
level."

     The VA contested the claim, arguing that Mildred Wiley had
never complained about cigarette smoke and that she had lived in
several other cities where she could have been exposed to other
carcinogens before beginning work at the hospital in 1973.

     Bujakowski noted in the compensation opinion that, in
response to the earlier claims, the hospital did not dispute the
extent of Wiley's exposure to cigarette smoke.  And, Bujakowski
said, the hospital's own expert witness conceded that he could
not rule out ETS as the cause of Mildred Wiley's cancer.

     Riley, Wiley's attorney, said that Wiley will receive a
$1,000 death and funeral benefit and will be entitled to payments
of approximately $21,500, one-half his wife's annual salary, each
year for the rest of his life.

     In May 1993, Wiley filed a product liability suit against
the major cigarette manufacturers in Delaware County, IN, state
court (Dunn et al. v. RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. et al.,
No. 18D019305CT06 [IN, Delaware Cty.]).  The tobacco industry
moved to transfer the case to Grant County; that motion was
denied.  The Indiana Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the
case should be transferred from Delaware County to Grant County
because Mildred Wiley resided in Grant County at the time of her
death.  The plaintiffs appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court.

     On Dec. 5, the Indiana Supreme Court reversed the Court of
Appeals and affirmed the trial court decision that the proper
venue for the trial was the Delaware County, IN, court.

     The VA, which is responsible for making the payments to
Wiley, could seek recovery by filing a claim against any judgment
Wiley may win in his lawsuit, or by filing claims against the
companies directly.

NC CT.: OFFICIAL NOTICE
OF CONTAMINATION STARTS
CLAIM CLOCK RUNNING

     An official government notice of well water contamination
starts the statute of limitations running, even if a plaintiff
notices earlier that the water smells and tastes bad, the North
Carolina Court of Appeals ruled Dec. 5.  Crawford v. Boyette et
al., No. COA95-37 (NC Ct. App.).

     The panel reinstated a nuisance, trespass and strict
liability suit against the owner and operator of a gas station by
a residential neighbor.

     From 1986 to 1991, John Crawford rented a house near a gas
station owned by Gary Boyette and operated by Cary Oil Co.  When
Crawford moved in, he attributed the noticeable funny smell and
taste of his well water to the known presence of lime in the
vicinity.

     In 1987, he contacted the county health department, which
recommended chlorination but did not test for petroleum products.
It was not until April 6, 1989, that Crawford was notified by the
state of specific chemical compounds found in his water,
including benzene and paradichlorobenzene.  In June 1989, he
received the state's official health risk evaluation warning of
the risks of gasoline contamination.

     A nuisance and trespass complaint was filed in Wake County
Superior Court on April 2, 1992, within three years of the
April 6, 1989, notice.  Judge George R. Greene granted summary
judgment in favor of the defense, holding the suit barred by the
three-year limitations period.

     The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded in an opinion by
Judge Ralph A. Walker, saying the limitations period did not
start to run until Crawford received official notification that
chemicals from petroleum products were found in his water.
Although Crawford noticed a peculiar smell and taste, he
attributed those problems to lime and took reasonable steps to
determine whether his well was contaminated by contacting the
county health department, it said.

     In addition, it said Crawford received no warnings about
petroleum contamination until the state sent its detailed
evaluation in June 1989.

     Kenneth N. Barnes argued for Crawford.  Defense counsel were
Robert R. Smith of Smith & Holmes and Phillip C. Ransdell of
Ransdell, Ransdell & Cline.

ED VA JUDGE DENIES MOTION
TO REMAND LEAD POISONING
LITIGATION TO STATE COURT

     A lead poisoning personal injury suit that names a federally
funded public housing authority as one of the defendants will
remain in federal court, according to a Nov. 20 ruling by a
federal judge in Norfolk, VA, denying the plaintiffs' motion to
remand to state court.  Hunter et al. v. Estate of Baecher et
al., No. 2:95CV878 (ED VA).

     A complaint was filed in state court against the estate of
John Joseph Baecher, who owned the property leased to the
plaintiffs.  It was amended to add as a defendant the Norfolk
Redevelopment and Housing Authority (NRHA), which administers the
federal section8 subsidized housing program.  As amended, the
complaint seeks $5 million in damages under section1983 and
federal housing statutes, breach of contract, negligence, breach
of warranty and violations of the state Residential Landlord and
Tenant Act and Virginia Consumer Protection Act.

     After it was added to the suit, the NRHA petitioned to
remove the case to the Eastern District of Virginia on the basis
of the federal court's original jurisdiction over the civil
rights and federal housing statute claims.  The plaintiffs moved
to remand to state court, and arguments were heard on the motion
on Nov. 17.

     U.S. District Judge J. Calvitt Clarke Jr. denied the remand
motion, rejecting arguments that state claims predominate and
that construction of the two Virginia statutes in the context of
lead paint poisoning present novel and complex issues that state
courts should resolve.

     Although case law in Virginia is sparse on how the
landlord-tenant statute handles lead paint poisoning disputes,
that statute is modeled on a uniform statute with abundant case
law, the judge said.  In addition, he said the state law claims
are no more technically or intellectually involved than the
federal claims.

     Beyond that, Judge Clarke found the interests of judicial
economy and fairness to the litigants warrant supplemental
jurisdiction over the state law claims.  The federal and state
claims all center around the issue of what duties exist regarding
the presence of lead paint in a rental residence; the parties and
operative facts also are the same.  Nor does the statute under
which the case was removed to federal court authorize a remand of
the federal questions, he said.

     "In this case, Plaintiffs have consolidated their claims
against the two defendants and have invoked federal law in the
process.  In bringing one suit, Plaintiffs and Defendants could
expect to be part of only one proceeding.  By bringing federal
claims, Plaintiffs could expect that proceeding would take place
in federal court.  Defendants, by removing the case, showed their
preference for federal court," Judge Clarke said.

     The plaintiffs were represented by Richard James Serpe,
Harold Seward Lawlor and Richard Steven Glasser of Glasser &
Glasser in Norfolk; and by Oscar Lawrence Gilbert of Rabinowitz,
Rafal, Swartz, Taliaferro & Gilbert in Norfolk.

     Defense counsel were Marshall Topping Bohannon Jr. of
Bohannon, Bohannon & Hancock in Norfolk; John D. Radd of Huff,
Poole & Mahoney in Virginia Beach; and Melanie Fix, James Long
Chapman IV and Francis N. Crenshaw of Crenshaw, Ware & Martin in
Norfolk.

CA JUDGE DENIES MOTION
TO VACATE CONSENT DECREE
IN LEAD FAUCET SUIT

     Finding that he made no error in issuing a consent judgment
approving a settlement between the state and seven water faucet
manufacturers to eliminate the lead in their products, San
Francisco County Superior Court Judge Carlos Bea on Nov. 28
denied a motion by defendant Price Pfister to vacate the
judgment.  People ex rel. Lungren v. American Standard et al.,
No. 948017 (CA Super. Ct., San Francisco Cty.).

     Judge Bea also granted the state's request for sanctions in
the amount of $950.  He ruled that Pfister's motion was not
entirely frivolous, but that it showed bad faith by introducing a
confidential settlement letter from the state that it had agreed
to keep out of the proceedings.

     Pfister was one of 16 defendants in a suit brought by the
state and several environmental groups alleging that the faucet
makers were in violation of the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic
Enforcement Act, also known as Proposition 65, a state law
enacted in 1986 that prohibits the discharge of toxic chemicals
into sources of drinking water.

     The settlement agreement with seven of the major faucet
manufacturers was approved in October in Superior Court over the
objections of Pfister and Chicago Faucet Co.  It calls for the
faucet makers to eliminate lead from their faucets by 1999 and to
affix warning labels on faucets that do not meet California's
standard limiting the amount of lead in drinking water to
0.5 micrograms of lead per day.  The seven companies " American
Standard, Moen, Masco, Eljer, Elkay, Whirlpool and Universal
Rundle " have agreed to apply the same standards nationwide.

     The settlement came about after the state lost its case
against the faucet manufacturers in Superior Court and lost an
appeal in the California Court of Appeal.  The defendants
successfully argued that household drinking water is not a
"source of drinking water" within the meaning of Proposition 65.
However, in two consolidated cases in Alameda County against
three water pump manufacturers, the Superior Court ruled just the
opposite, i.e., that Proposition 65 does apply to tap water, thus
prompting the settlement.  The three water pump manufacturers
also joined in the settlement.

     In the meantime, the California Supreme Court has agreed to
hear an appeal of the appellate court ruling in the San Francisco
case solely on the issue of whether Proposition 65 includes
plumbing fixtures.

     In its motion to vacate, Pfister argued that the court erred
in presuming that the attorney general properly carried out his
duty to enforce Proposition 65 and that the court accepted an
improper standard for testing the lead content in faucets that
does not accurately detect whether the daily lead exposure
exceeds the legal limit of .5 micrograms per day.

     Judge Bea ruled that Pfister misconstrued the attorney
general's actions and the consent judgment.

     "No 'standard' has been adopted by the Attorney General or
the Court.  The testing protocol at issue is merely a means for
implementing and enforcing the .5 micrograms of lead per day
exposure standard called for in the regulations," he said.

     The state had requested $2,500 in sanctions against Pfister
for bringing a frivolous motion to vacate, but Judge Bea found
that the motion was not wholly frivolous because the state's
Rules of Civil Procedure do permit parties to contend that a
court's decision is based on legal error.  He did find, however,
that Pfister showed bad faith in filing the confidential
settlement letter under seal as part of its motion and in using
the letter as the basis of a declaration from an expert witness
that the testing protocol is not accurate.

     Pfister had agreed not to use the letter in any form in the
litigation and it should have adhered to that agreement, he said.
"'An honest man's word is his bond,'" Judge Bea said quoting from
Don Quixote.  "In this court, at least, the words of Don Miguel
de Cervantes are not only found true but enforced."  He ruled
that the state is entitled to recoup $950, its expenditures
caused by Pfister's use of the letter.

     Pfister was represented by James L. Meeder, San Francisco.
The state was represented by Deputy Attorney General Edward G.
Weil.

9TH CIRCUIT REINSTATES
COUNTY WORKER'S CLAIMS
AGAINST EXTERMINATORS

     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Oct. 26
reinstated the claims of a former Santa Clara County, CA, planner
against two exterminating companies that she alleges made her
sick when they applied pesticides to the building where she
worked.  Jensen v. County of Santa Clara et al., Nos. 94-16063
and 94-16824 (9th Cir.).

     The appellate court, however, ruled that her claims against
the county and some of its employees are barred by California's
workers compensation and government immunity statutes.

     Cheriel Jensen was an associate planner for Santa Clara
County from 1977 to 1993.  On June 14, 1993, she filed suit in
Santa Clara Superior Court against the county, 14 county
employees and officials, two pest control companies " Instar Pest
Consultants Inc. and Applied Pest Management Inc. (APM) " and an
APM official, Gregory Clark.  Instar provided pest control
services to the county from 1983 to 1990, and APM provided pest
control services from 1990 to 1993.

     Jensen's suit alleged that the two companies applied a
pesticide called Safrotin, which made her chronically ill.
Acting pro se, she alleged 22 federal and state law causes of
action including negligence, failure to warn, denial of civil
rights, violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act,
fraudulent concealment and breach of contract.

     The suit was removed to U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California where Judge James Ware dismissed 13 of the
county defendants and 17 of Jensen's causes of action.  He also
dismissed with leave to amend five of Jensen's claims against the
remaining county defendants, and Jensen filed a first amended
complaint in February 1994.

     In April 1994, Judge Ware granted summary judgment to
Instar, finding that Jensen's personal injury claims against the
company were time-barred by California's one-year statute of
limitations.  He later denied Jensen's motion to remand the suit
to state court, dismissed her remaining claims against the county
defendant and dismissing her second amended complaint against APM
and Clark.

     Jensen appealed all of those judgments, and the Ninth
Circuit affirmed all but the personal injury claims against
Instar and her second amended complaint against APM.

     According to the unpublished opinion, the circuit court
found that the district court correctly dismissed the claims
against the county defendants because they are barred by the
exclusivity provisions of the California Workers' Compensation
Act.

     The lower court also correctly dismissed the claims against
the county employees and officials because they are immune from
liability for actions taken within the scope of their employment
under the California Government Code section820.9, the appellate
panel said.

     In addition, Judge Ware ruled correctly that Jensen could
not file a claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
because it is not retroactive.  She stopped working 25 days
before the ADA went into effect, the circuit court said.

     On the personal injury claims against Instar, the Ninth
Circuit reversed and remanded Judge Ware's dismissal of those
claims because they were filed on time from the date she
discovered the alleged cause of her injuries.  Although Jensen
had suffered symptoms from 1977, she believed that her illness
was caused by the state's Malathion medfly spraying.  It was not
until June 12, 1992, that she discovered that her injuries may
have been caused by the county's pest control actions, and she
filed her first complaint on June 14, 1993, which is within the
one-year statute of limitations period, the appellate court said.

     The Ninth Circuit also reinstated Jensen's second amended
complaint against APM, which the district court had dismissed
because of her failure to comply with its court order to remove
four claims.  The appellate panel said that Jensen did try to
comply with the order and that the district court's sanction was
too harsh and constituted an abuse of its discretion.

9TH CIR. DETERMINES HEALTH
ASSESSMENT TO CONSTITUTE
REMOVAL OR RESPONSE

     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 7 affirmed a
Washington federal court's dismissal of a citizens' group's bid
to compel the Agency for Toxic Research and Disease Registry
(ATSDR) to initiate a health assessment program in the region of
the Hanford Nuclear Reservation.  Hanford Downwinders Coalition
et al. v. Dowdle et al., No. 94-35100 (9th Cir.).

     The panel agreed that no federal court jurisdiction existed
over the claim and concluded that the ATSDR's ongoing health
assessment activity in the region constituted a removal or
remedial action for the purposes of CERCLA's Timing of Review
provision.

     The litigation stems from ongoing cleanup efforts at the
Hanford facility in Richland, WA, which for some 30 years
produced plutonium for the Department of Defense.  The facility
generated releases of radioactive iodine and other hazardous
substances into the atmosphere, soil and water of the region.

     In 1988, the EPA proposed adding the Hanford site to the
National Priorities List (NPL).  The following year, the EPA,
Department of Energy and Washington Department of Ecology
outlined their response.  The ATSDR was assigned specific
responsibilities under the response plan to prepare preliminary
health assessments, and was given the discretion to expand them
to full health assessments if warranted.

     The Hanford site has remained the subject of continued
research by the ATSDR.  In 1993, the ATSDR declared the site to
be among the Superfund sites posing the greatest threat to public
health, and has applied the results of the Centers for Disease
Control's 1994 study to its criteria for determining whether
medical monitoring would be appropriate.

     Plaintiffs Hanford Downwinders Coalition Inc. (HDC) brought
the instant litigation in July 1993, alleging that the ATSDR has
a mandatory duty under CERCLA section9604(i)(9) to commence a
health surveillance program in the region, including medical
testing and monitoring for individuals exposed to radioactive
iodine.  The Eastern District of Washington granted the defense's
dismissal motion, concluding that the ATSDR's health-related
activities at Hanford constituted ongoing removal or response
activity, and that the plaintiffs' claim was therefore an
impermissible challenge.

     Affirming, the Ninth Circuit first rejected the plaintiffs'
contentions that the language of the statute supported their
construction of the statute.  The HDC asserted that when Congress
instructed the ATSDR to "effectuate and implement [CERCLA's]
health-related authorities" in section9604(i)(1) of the statute,
it meant to distinguish these health-related authorities from
"response authorities" as defined under section9604.  "There is
no indication that Congress' characterization of ATSDR
authorities as 'health related' was intended to render the
section9604 'response authorities' section superfluous as to
ATSDR actions," the panel rejoined.

     The panel found that the language of section9604(i)(1)
"should be read narrowly as a means to distinguish between
different types of response authorities, rather than interpreted
broadly as an effort to differentiate ATSDR health assessment and
surveillance activity from response actions protected by the
Timing of Review provision."

     Cautioning that not all section9604 "response authorities"
are to be considered removal or remedial actions per se, the
Ninth Circuit engaged in an analysis of whether the ATSDR's
conduct could be shown to be removal or remedial activity.  "The
ATSDR health assessment and surveillance activities challenged by
the HDC," the panel wrote, "are a necessary part of the
government's efforts to safeguard the public health at NPL
sites....  [The ATDSR] is an integral part of Congress' effort to
protect the health of those exposed to hazardous releases from
facilities listed on the NPL."

     The court reconciled the instant case with its holdings in
Durfey v. E.I. DuPont (1995) (See Toxic Chemicals LR, July 18,
1995, P. 21,563) and Price v. U.S. Navy (1994) which declared
that independent private actions for medical monitoring were not
removal or remedial actions.  "The reasoning in Durfey and Price
does not apply to health assessment and surveillance actions
engaged in by a governmental agency pursuant to explicit CERCLA
provisions," wrote the panel.

     The plaintiffs pointed to the structure of CERCLA, noting
that section9607(a)(4)(A), which provides for the government to
recover "all costs of removal or remedial action," is separate
from section9607(a)(4)(D), which provides for the recovery of
"the costs of any health assessment" made by the ATSDR.  The
panel rejoined that section9607(a)(4)(D) was in fact part of the
1986 SARA amendments, and "decline[d] to read the failure of
Congress to accomplish the seamless integration of ATSDR
provisions with the other authorities found under subsection
9607(a)(4)(A) as compelling proof of Congress' intent to
distinguish ATSDR activities from removal and remedial actions."

     The plaintiffs also pointed to the separate treatment of
response costs and ATSDR costs in CERCLA sections 9611(a) and
9611(c).  Noting the fact that the legislative history was silent
as to why the distinction was made, the panel stated its
obligation "to choose the interpretation that is most consistent
with the remainder of the Act."

     Having established that the ATSDR's conduct constituted
removal or remedial action, the Ninth Circuit disposed of HDC's
assertions that the requirements of the Timing of Review
provision were otherwise unsatisfied.  The panel looked to its
1995 holdings in MESS v. Perry (see Hazardous Waste LR, March 1,
1995, P. 28,144) and Razore v. Tulalip Tribes (see Hazardous
Waste LR, Oct. 4, 1995, P. 28,238) in concluding that the HDC's
suit was a "challenge" to the ongoing removal or remediation.

     Tom H. Foulds, Seattle, represents the appellants.

     Elizabeth Ann Peterson of the U.S. Department of Justice,
Environment and Natural Resources Division, Washington, DC,
represents the appellees.

3RD CIR.: NEIGHBORS,
VISITORS TO WASTE SITE
ARE NOT KNOWN CREDITORS

     Neighbors of a dump site contaminated by low-level radiation
were not known creditors and, therefore, the corporate owner of
the sites had no obligation to provide them with actual notice
when it went into bankruptcy, the Third Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals ruled Dec. 18.  Chemetron Corp. v. Jones et al., No. 94-
3371 (3rd Cir.).

     From 1965 to 1975, Chemetron Corp. owned and operated a
manufacturing facility that made an antimony oxide catalyst
utilizing depleted plutonium, as well as a nearby landfill where
it dumped waste products from that manufacturing process in
Cuyahoga Heights, OH.  Chemetron sold the sites in 1975, but was
involved in cleanup efforts between 1980 and 1988 after it was
discovered that the sites were contaminated with radioactive
waste.

     In 1988, Chemetron filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.
The court issued a claims bar date order fixing the last day for
creditors to file claims as May 31, 1988.  Chemetron sent the
required actual notice to all of its known creditors and also
voluntarily placed advertisements in the New York Times and Wall
Street Journal in an effort to reach any unknown creditors.

     In 1992, 15 individuals filed suit against Chemetron and its
successors in interest in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common
Pleas claiming to have been injured from exposure to radioactive
and toxic chemicals at the dump site.  Eventually the list of
plaintiffs grew to 21.  Two of the plaintiffs had lived in houses
near the site and the rest were periodic visitors to the houses.

     Chemetron moved to dismiss the suit, arguing that any such
claim had been discharged in the bankruptcy proceedings that
ended in 1990.  The plaintiffs then petitioned the bankruptcy
court to be allowed to file late claims.  In August 1993, the
bankruptcy court granted the petition, finding that the
plaintiffs were known creditors that had been entitled to actual
notice of the proceedings and the claims bar date.  The
bankruptcy court then reserved ruling on the issue of whether the
plaintiffs' claims were dischargeable.

     Chemetron appealed the bankruptcy court ruling to the U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, which
reversed the bankruptcy court's grant of the motion to file late
claims.  The district court held that the plaintiffs were not
known creditors and that the notice published in the two national
newspapers was sufficient to alert them to the bankruptcy
proceedings.  The district court also ruled, without explanation,
that the plaintiffs' claims were dischargeable and were
discharged as a result of the bankruptcy action.

     The plaintiffs appealed to the Third Circuit, which affirmed
the district court finding that the plaintiffs are unknown
creditors.  In Tulsa Professional Collection Service Inc. v.
Roper, 485 U.S. 478, 490 (1988), the U.S. Supreme Court
characterized a known creditor as one whose identity is either
known or "reasonably ascertainable by the debtor," Circuit Judge
Jane R. Roth wrote.  Generally, debtors are expected to identify
known creditors through a careful search of their own books and
records and further efforts are not required, she explained.

     In this case, she said, the bankruptcy court replaced the
"reasonably ascertainable" standard with a "reasonably
foreseeable" standard.  Under that test, the bankruptcy court
said Chemetron knew or should have known that it was reasonably
foreseeable that it would suffer claims from individuals living
near the sites, making them known creditors.

     This "reasonably foreseeable" standard is an incorrect rule
of law that imposes an impossible burden on debtors, the Third
Circuit found.  None of the claimants currently lives near the
site and some have moved as far away as Texas.  "We are hard
pressed to conceive of any way the debtor could identify, locate,
and provide actual notice to these claimants," Judge Roth said.

     Having affirmed the district court's ruling that the
plaintiffs were unknown claimants in the bankruptcy action and
that the newspaper notices therefore were sufficient to inform
them of the proceedings, the circuit court found that the
district court erred in failing to consider whether the
plaintiffs' failure to file their claims in a timely manner was
due to "excusable neglect."  The appellate panel remanded that
issue to the district court with instructions to consider the
totality of the circumstances and the potential prejudicial
impact on Chemetron.

               It also vacated the district court's ruling that the
plaintiffs' claims were dischargeable and discharged by the
bankruptcy action and remanded that issue to the bankruptcy
court.  Because the bankruptcy court had postponed ruling on the
issue of discharge, it was not an appealable order and therefore
was not properly before the district court, the Third Circuit
said.

     Circuit Judge H. Lee Sarokin concurred in the judgment but
said that the Third Circuit went too far in discarding the
"reasonably ascertainable" test entirely.  "These tests are not
mutually exclusive, or even at odds.  They address separate
issues," Judge Sarokin wrote.  One has to do with whether a
debtor knew or should have known a claim would be brought while
the other has to do with the debtor's ability to identify a
potential claimant, he said.

     The Jones plaintiffs were represented by William Mitchell
and Deborah J. Papushak of Armstrong, Mitchell & Damiani,
Cleveland.  Chemetron was represented Dennis G. Terez of Squire,
Sanders & Dempsey, Cleveland, and George L. Cass of Buchanan,
Ingersoll, Pittsburgh.

PLAINTIFF IN ILL HEALTH
SEEKS EXPEDITED APPEAL
OF DEFENSE VERDICT

     The plaintiff in a personal injury suit against the owners
and operators of the St. Onofre Nuclear Generating Station
(SONGS) will petition the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
this week for an expedited appeal of a jury verdict in favor of
the defense after losing a bid for a retrial on Dec. 5, according
to his attorney, Don Howarth.   James v. Southern California
Edison Co., No. 94-1085 (SD CA).

     Howarth filed a notice of appeal on Dec. 22.  He said that
his client, Glen James, 63, who is suffering from chronic
myelogenous leukemia, is in rapidly deteriorating health and that
he wants to expedite the appeal on James' behalf "while it may
still do him some good."  James, an engineer, worked at SONGS in
the mid-1980s.

     Howarth moved for a new trial after the eight-person jury
returned a verdict in favor of defendants Southern California
Edison and Combustion Engineering Inc. on Oct. 12.  He argued
that the jury was improperly influenced by the O.J. Simpson trial
and by juror misconduct.

     Howarth argued that the verdict was against the weight of
the evidence, that it was the product of improper passion and
prejudice and that the jury improperly considered extraneous,
prejudicial information.

               According to the motion, one of the jurors, Genevieve
Fitzwater, told the others that she had received radiation
therapy for thyroid cancer and that "it had saved my life."  In
addition, after the jurors were allowed to watch the verdict in
the O.J. Simpson case, Fitzwater also allegedly told the others
that they must apply the same "reasonable doubt" standard used in
the Simpson murder case to the evidence in this case.

     James also alleged that a second juror told a post-verdict
gathering that he had made his mind up for the defense early in
the trial before all of the evidence had been presented and that
he had never wavered in his belief.

     Southern District of California Judge Napoleon Jones Jr.
rejected all of those arguments, finding that under the Federal
Rules of Evidence, most of juror Gregory Hafen's declaration
supporting the allegations of juror misconduct is inadmissible.

     According to Rule 606(b), a juror may not testify to
anything that may have influenced his decision during
deliberations except on the question of whether extraneous
prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's
attention.

     Under that rule, only Fitzwater's statements about her
radiation treatment and applying the reasonable doubt standard
may be admissible if they can be shown to be extraneous
information and prejudicial by a preponderance of the evidence,
Judge Jones said.

     He ruled, however, that Fitzwater's alleged statements about
her radiation treatment are not prejudicial extraneous
information but "are best classified as personal experience
applied to the evidence in the case...."

     Citing to Hard v. Burlington Northern Railroad Co., 870 F.2d
1461 (9th Cir. 1989), Judge Jones said, "The type of after-
acquired information that potentially taints a jury verdict
should be carefully distinguished from the general knowledge,
opinions, feelings and bias that every juror carries into the
jury room."

     In Hard, he said, the Ninth Circuit found that it is
acceptable for a juror to use his own personal experience to
interpret the evidence in a case.  In addition, even if
Fitzwater's statements did constitute impermissible extraneous
information, the plaintiff failed to show prejudice by a
preponderance of the evidence.

     On the reasonable doubt issue, Judge Jones found that such
allegations are not admissible because they constitute testimony
on the mental processes of the jury.  He found no Ninth Circuit
precedence on the issue, but he cited two Fifth Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals cases that hold that once a verdict is rendered,
the court may not inquire into the jury's deliberative process to
determine if the jury properly followed the court's instructions
(United States v. D'Angelo, 598 F.2d 1002 [1979] and Robles v.
Exxon Corp., 862 F.2d 1201 [1989]).

     In addition to Howarth, the Jameses are represented by
Suzelle M. Smith of Howarth & Smith in Los Angeles.  Southern
California Edison is represented by Jack Reding of Crosby,
Heafey, Roach & May in Oakland, CA.

OHIO JUDGE GRANTS J.N.O.V.
TO PLAINTIFFS AFTER JURY
RETURNS DEFENCE VERDICT

     The defendants in a sick building syndrome suit in
Cincinnati filed a notice of appeal Dec. 29, challenging the
trial court's grant of judgment notwithstanding the verdict to
four plaintiffs on the issue of negligence after a jury returned
a unanimous verdict in favor of the building's owners.  Beck v.
A & D Limited Partnership et al., No. A-91-06574 (OH C.P. Ct.,
Hamilton Cty.).

     While Common Pleas Judge John W. O'Keefe found that the
evidence overwhelmingly supported a finding of negligence, he
denied the plaintiffs' motion for j.n.o.v. with regard to
punitive damages and also denied their motion for a new trial.
His decision was entered into judgment on Dec. 6.

     (The memorandum specifying grounds for the decision is
available from Andrews Document Access Service.)

     Judge O'Keefe granted j.n.o.v. to plaintiffs Sue Marshall,
Linda Bachman, Karen M. Ringland and Joseph Schwetschenau.  He
denied a motion for j.n.o.v. as to the loss of consortium claims
of Schwetschenau's wife, Dolores, finding that the jury's verdict
on that claim was acceptable.

     The four plaintiffs were sample plaintiffs for some 700
class members who claim that the A & D Building where they work
in Cincinnati caused headaches, fatigue, drowsiness, sore throat,
sinus problems, nausea, dizziness, eye irritation, chest pains,
disorientation, anguish and justifiable apprehension.

     Judge O'Keefe said that the jury should have answered in the
affirmative both Interrogatory 1 (Were the defendants negligent?)
and Interrogatory 2 (Do you find by a preponderance of the
evidence that any defendant breached any lease agreement?).

     "The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated that A & D was
unsafe and unsanitary, and the defendants thus were negligent,
and reasonable minds could come to only one conclusion as to
safety and sanitation," he said.

               He cited the testimony of four expert witnesses that
conditions in the building caused human health problems, as well
as two exhibits from the Cincinnati Health Department that
verified the poor indoor air quality as evidence of causation.

     Given his grant of j.n.o.v. on negligence, Judge O'Keefe
denied the plaintiffs' motion for a new trial because, he said,
there is no ground for a new trial unless the j.n.o.v. is
overturned on appeal.  By denying j.n.o.v. on the issue of
punitive damages, Judge O'Keefe said that the jury verdict
denying punitive damages would stand for the entire class of
claimants.

     On the issue of actual damages, Judge O'Keefe ordered a
bench hearing for Jan. 8 to determine the amount of actual
damages.  That hearing has since been postponed pending a
resolution of the appealability of the judge's j.n.o.v. order.
In a footnote, Judge O'Keefe said that "probably there is no
final appealable order until damages are determined and made part
of the Court's ultimate judgment,"  but the notice of appeal
specifically challenges the j.n.o.v.

     The plaintiffs are represented by Louise M. Roselle and
Colleen M. Hegge of Waite, Schneider, Bayless & Chesley and by
William Eric Minamyer of Kepley, MacConnell & Eyrich.  The
defendants are represented by W. John Sellins and A. Dennis
Miller of Droeder & Miller.  All three firms are located in
Cincinnati.

PARENTS OF PRO GOLFER
HEATHER FARR SUE MOTOROLA
FOR WRONGFUL DEATH

     The parents of professional golfer Heather Farr filed suit
against Motorola Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District
of Arizona Nov. 17, alleging that groundwater pollution from
three Phoenix-area Motorola plants caused the breast cancer that
killed Farr in 1993 at the age of 28.  Farr v. Motorola Inc.,
No. 95-2530 PHX-ROS (D AZ).

     The complaint alleges that Motorola has been dumping
trichloroethylene (TCE) and 19 other toxic and hazardous
chemicals into the air and ground since the 1950s and that a
plume of the chemicals seeped into the groundwater that Farr and
hundreds of other people used for drinking water.  It says that
Farr grew up in the vicinity of the plants.  Two of the plants
have been designated as federal Superfund sites, and the third
has been declared a polluted site under Arizona's state anti-
pollution statute.

     Farr was an All-American at Arizona State University before
turning pro and becoming the youngest golfer to qualify for the
LPGA tour in 1986.  She died in November 1993 after undergoing a
mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a bone-marrow
transplant.

     The complaint filed by her parents, Sharon and Gerald D.
Farr, allege wrongful death, negligence, trespass, infliction of
emotional distress, fraudulent concealment/failure to warn and
strict liability.

     According to the complaint, Motorola negligently disposed of
large quantities of toxic chemicals in and around the plants
resulting in bodily harm to Farr.  The company had special
knowledge of the types, amounts, dates and methods of disposal of
the chemicals going back the 1950s, but it failed to warn persons
living near the plants of the potential harm from the dumping and
it made express and implied false representations to conceal the
dangers of the chemicals from the public.

     "Motorola's acts of knowingly and intentionally disposing of
toxic and hazardous substances and wastes into the environment
without proper treatment constitute extreme and outrageous
conduct, which Motorola knew or should have known would cause
severe emotional distress to persons such as the deceased or
acted in reckless disregard of whether such emotional distress
would result," the complaint said.

     The Farrs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages,
attorneys' fees and costs.  The plaintiffs agreed to grant
Motorola an extension to file a motion or answer until Jan. 16

     Lead attorney for the plaintiffs is John M. O'Quinn of
Houston.  They are also represented by Robert H. Hinton of Hinton
& Cox, Houston; Dennis C. Reich of Reich & Binstock, Houston;
Stephanie Shapiro and Elaine Watson of Shapiro & Watson, Houston;
John A. Buttrick and Charles S. Price of Brown & Bain, Phoenix;
and Carl D. Shaw in O'Quinn's Phoenix office.  O'Quinn and Brown
& Bain are also involved in 800 cases brought against Motorola by
neighbors of the three plants.

     Motorola is represented by Garrett B. Johnson in Kirkland &
Ellis's Chicago office; John A. Zackrison in Kirkland & Ellis's
Los Angeles office; and Floyd P. Bienstock of Steptoe & Johnson,
Phoenix.

OCCIDENTAL PAYS $129M
TO CLOSE A CHAPTER
ON LOVE CANAL

     Occidental Chemical Corp. has agreed to pay the U.S.
government $129 million in cleanup costs and interest to settle a
16-year-old suit resulting from decades of pollution at Love
Canal, the incident that spurred Congress to enact the Superfund
Law of 1980.  United States et al. v. Hooker Chemical Corp. et
al., No. 79-CV-990C (WD NY).

     Under the proposed consent decree, announced Dec. 21,
Occidental Chemical Corp. (Oxychem) will pay $102 million to the
Environmental Protection Agency and $28 million to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  FEMA handled the initial
cleanup and relocation of Love Canal residents.

     From 1942 to 1953, Oxychem's corporate predecessor, Hooker
Chemical, dumped an estimated 22,000 tons of toxic chemicals and
hazardous wastes at Love Canal from its Niagara Falls
manufacturing plant.  The site was eventually covered over and
deeded to the City of Niagara Falls.  Homes and a school were
later built on and near it.  Chemicals began seeping into the
houses in the 1970s, sickening residents.  One resident, Lois
Gibbs, led a crusade to expose Hooker's actions and to clean up
the site.

     In 1979, the federal government and New York state brought
suit against Hooker.  The federal government initially sought
compensation of more than $200 million in cleanup costs under
CERCLA, and the state sought $250 million in punitive damages.
Oxychem was held liable in the liability phase of the trial, but
the state's claims for punitive damages were denied.

     In June 1994, Oxychem agreed to pay the state $98 million to
settle the remaining state claims.  The U.S. Army has also agreed
to pay the government $8 million for its share of the costs for
cleaning up hazardous waste that it dumped at the site during
World War II.

     The consent decree, which is expected to receive final
approval in 30 days, eliminates the need for a second trial on
damages.  Under its terms, Oxychem will pay the $129 million in
four installments over three years, beginning three months after
the court grants final approval.

     While the proposed settlement closes out the federal and
state cleanup claims, it does not end the litigation over Love
Canal.  The City of Niagara Falls is seeking $4 million in costs
and interest, and 900 former residents have personal injury
lawsuits still pending.  In the wake of the federal and state
settlements, Niagara Falls expects that it will soon reach a
settlement with the company to end its suit as well.

     In announcing the settlement, U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno called it "the transformation of an environmental disaster
called Love Canal into a success story.  It stands for the
principle that when people make a mess, they should clean it up."

     A spokesman for Occidental Chemical said that the company
has never denied liability, but that the settlement represents a
compromise among the parties on the amount of compensation,
rather than fines or penalties.  The agreement, he said, avoids
having to go through a protracted trial on damages.

     Occidental Chemical is represented by Steven K. Yablonski of
Piper & Marbury, Washington, DC.  The federal government is
represented by Steven Novick and Steven R. Baer of the U.S.
Justice Department, Washington, DC.

CA APP. CT. REVERSES
CARRIER WIN ON
WRONGFUL ENTRY

     The California Court of Appeal, Second District, on Dec. 5
overturned a Los Angeles judge's grant of summary adjudication to
Insurance Co. of North America (INA) on the environmental
coverage demands of Martin Marietta Corp.  Martin Marietta Corp.
et al v. Insurance Co. of North America, No. B084709 (CA
Ct. App., 2nd Dist.).

     The panel found that the policyholder had raised the issue
of potential of coverage for its environmental claims under the
"wrongful entry" provisions of INA's policies.

     Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin) named its carriers to
the present action to determine their obligations concerning the
insured's liabilities incurred at multiple Superfund sites.  The
policyholder made claims against INA with respect to the
Stringfellow site and six others across the country.

     INA issued automobile and personal injury coverage to Martin
Marietta from 1968 to 1972; the insured averred that the
"wrongful entry or eviction, or other invasion of the right of
private occupancy" language provision of the personal injury
provision created the potential of coverage for its environmental
liabilities.  The Los Angeles County Superior Court concluded
that the coverage "for certain damages because of personal injury
cannot reasonably be construed as including government pollution
clean-up claims."

     In its review, the state appellate panel noted INA's
contention that the "wrongful entry" language "provides coverage
only for 'classic landlord/tenant-type disputes.'  Under INA's
interpretation, 'wrongful entry or eviction' refers only to
forcible eviction claims brought by one with a possessory
interest in the land, and 'other invasion of the right of private
occupancy' extends that coverage to claims brought by occupants,
rather than owners."

     The court next looked to state precedent that interpreted
the challenged language outside of the environmental context.
The panel found these cases to establish that "under California
law, the language 'wrongful entry or eviction, or other invasion
of the right of private occupancy' is limited to tort claims
relating to the invasion of an interest in real property....
[C]ontrary to INA's argument here, personal injury coverage is
not determined by the nature of the damages sought in the action
against the insured, but by the nature of the claims made against
the insured in that action."

     The court then looked to the February 1994 ruling of the
California Court of Appeal, Fourth District, in Titan Corp. v.
Aetna Casualty, which had refused to find environmental coverage
under the personal injury provision.  "[U]nlike Martin Marietta's
INA policy, the insurance policy under review in Titan Corp.
contained a pollution exclusion which 'unambiguously declared'
that the policy would not pay for either bodily injury or
property damage caused by pollution," wrote the panel.

     The Titan court alternatively reasoned that it is not
"objectively reasonable for an insured to expect personal injury
to mean property damage, or to expect contamination of
groundwater to harm either a private right or an occupancy
right."  The panel here found that this reasoning "seems to
depart from California law."

     After reviewing the federal and out-of-state precedent on
the issue cited by both sides, the panel found them to "lack a
consensus of approach and of result.  Many concern insurance
policies which are in important ways different than the one we
are called on to interpret."

Trespass and Nuisance

     In looking to the language of the policy at hand, the court
stated that it "cannot accept INA's contention that the coverage
clause at issue is limited to 'classic landlord/tenant'
claims....  [I]t seems manifest that 'wrongful entry,' in the
context of torts relating to the invasion of an interest in real
property, includes trespass and may include nuisance, and that a
reasonable insured would so understand the coverage."

     INA averred that neither trespass nor nuisance was
specifically enumerated in the torts listed under the policy; the
panel rejoined that "the language of the policy clearly
encompasses those causes of action, and there is no requirement,
in the policy or in the law, that each covered cause of action be
'specifically enumerated.'"

     The panel cited to an 1885 ruling of the California Supreme
Court that stated that "every wrongful entry upon lands in the
occupation or possession of the owner constitutes a trespass."
The court also noted that it is established in California "that
trespass and nuisance claims may include wrongful entry or
invasion by pollutants....  To agree with INA that 'wrongful
entry' does not include trespass and nuisance claims would fly in
the face of this long-standing law."

               The panel rejected the insurer's contention that a wrongful
entry claim requires proof of forcible entry with intent to
ouster; it was further unmoved by the contention that the
underlying claimant (the government) cannot claim a right of
"occupancy" in the contaminated groundwater.

     "INA has not established that the government is seeking to
enforce only a public or residual interest in groundwater," wrote
the court.  "Instead, the undisputed facts indicate that the
government claims include allegations that pollutants emanating
from Martin Marietta have contaminated the water wells and
groundwater on land owned by individuals, businesses, and,
perhaps, governmental entities."

     The court lastly determined that INA had not met its burden
of showing that it was entitled to summary judgment.  The
underlying claims, wrote the panel, "are based in part on
trespass and nuisance....  [T]he actions [include] allegations of
wrongful entry and of invasions of the right of private occupancy
in real property."

     Kirk A. Pasich, Martin D. Katz and Linda D. Kornfeld of
Troop Meisinger Steuber & Pasich, Los Angeles, represent the
policyholder.

     W. Mark Wood, Martin S. Checov and H. Douglas Galt of
O'Melveny & Myers, Los Angeles, represent the insurer.

SLANTS & TRENDS

FISHER'S VIEWS ON TITLE III:  The pressue on industrial companies resulting
from annual reports of routine toxic releases under the Emergency Planning
and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) will continue to build, said
Environmental Protection Agency Assistant Administrator Linda Fisher.

'MORE AND MORE PEOPLE are paying more attention" to EPCRA because all
companies want their emission numbers to improve year by year, she said
Dec. 15.  "Information in the public's hands is a powerful tool, and it
has allowed, in a sense, industry to fix itself, which is probably a more
effective way than others."

THE LAW HAS BEEN 'VERY EFFECTIVE,' Fisher told TMN.  "When you have the
head of Monsanto or Du Pont or even small companies saying, 'I am making a
concerted effort to change behavior in my plant so we don't emit as much of
a toxic chemical,' that to me is a very postive thing."  Du Pont Inc.
Chairman E.S. Woolard stated Dec. 12 that the company would try to cut
toxic air emissions by 60 percent by 1993 (TMN, Dec. 20, 1989).
Monsanto Co. Chairman Richard J.  Mahoney said June 30, 1988, that the
company would cut toxic emissions world-wide by 90 percent by December
1992.

CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION members are being urged to take part in
the April 22 anniversary celebrations of Earth Day.  CMA is providing
members with ideas for getting their facilities involved in community
activities.  Allied Signal's Fluorine Products Division, Morristown, N.J.,
said it will purchase and donate a siren system to the county, CMA noted in
a release.  The system will be operated through the county emergency
services agency to warn residents of hazardous materials spills, fires and
natural disasters.

SOLKATRONIC CHEMICALS INC., Morrisville, Pa., donated a weather station to
communities surrounding its facility, held a seminar for local officials
on chemical dispersion modeling and donated equipment and funds to the
Bucks County Hazardous Incident Response Team.

NRC REPORTS DOE NUCLEAR SITE WORKERS
AT RISK FROM CHEMICALS AND RADIATION

     Workers at virtually every facility in the Department of Energy's
(DOE) 17-site nuclear weapons complex are at risk due to contamination of
the plants by radioactive and other hazardous materials, says a report
released Dec. 20 by the National Research Council (NRC).

     However, chemical hazards at DOE's weapons plants probably pose the
greatest threat to workers' health, notes "The Nuclear Weapons Complex:
Management for Health, Safety and the Environment."  While substantial
progress has been made in controlling exposure to ionizing radiation, there
appears to be a less than adequate emphasis at DOE's plants on hazards
associated with exposures to chemicals routinely used in industrial
operations, NRC says.  The substances of greatest concern include
beryllium, asbestos, cutting oils, organic solvents and plating solutions.

     "Occupational medical programs within the complex should increase the
emphasis placed on protection of workers from chemicals suspected to be
hazardous at the acute, subacute or chronic level of exposure," NRC
recommends.  The council suggests "removal of the worker from the hazard,
as in the case of pregnant workers," as one type of "control" for handling
toxic materials.  So-called "fetal protection policies" have come under
fire in federal courts as discriminatory (TMN, Nov. 1, 1989).

     The collection of health-related data concerning employees in the
nuclear weapons complex is inadequate with regard to both the kinds of data
collected and how they are stored, NRC says.  To correct the situation, the
report urges DOE to improve monitoring and surveillance programs for
exposure to hazardous substances through the use of standardized protocols
for data collection and analysis.  "In particular, data collected within
the complex should be comprehensive, accessible and comparable," the report
advises.

     NRC also cites as inadequate the fire control programs and the efforts
to control inhalation of radioactive dust by workers.  At least two
facilities have plutonium in their exhaust ducts, it notes.

     Blame for some of the problems lies with DOE's "complex management
structure with ambiguous lines of responsibility and authority," the NRC
says.  The report suggests that safety and other related decisions should
be made "at the lowest possible management levels."  DOE has accumulated a
great deal of information on the effects of exposure to radiation and this
should be made available for study, NRC adds.  DOE officials have promised
action on this issue.  The report is available for $15 from the National
Academy Press, 2101 Con?stitution Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20418; phone

KENTUCKY'S DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (DEP) has drafted a
comprehensive plan to strengthen environmental regulations.  The proposals
for toxic materials include:  installing air monitoring net?works in
selected areas; requiring waste reduction audits; proposing legislation to
have industry partially fund research on toxic effects; setting up a risk
assessment department in DEP; and monitoring ground water near hazardous
waste sites, land farms and under-ground storage tanks.  The department,
which intends to seek funding this year to implement its plan, also made
enforcement and hazardous waste reduction proposals.  For copies of the

SCIENTISTS CHAMPION PERMEABLE ZEOLITE
AS NEW DETECTOR OF TOXIC MATERIALS

     Recent technological breakthroughs in chemical analysis may lead to a
new era of inexpensive, high-speed monitoring of ground water, waste sites
and work places for toxic substances.  Researchers from the University of
New Mexico and the Sandia National Laboratories of Albuquerque, N.M., are
developing new chemical sensors using zeolite, a porous mineral that can
act as a "molecular sieve."

     Using polymers, the zeolite crystals can be arranged so that they act
as highly selective chemical screens, said Thomas Bein, assistant chemistry
profes?sor at the University of New Mexico and a member of the research
team.  These "screens" will allow only a single type of molecule to be
absorbed.  "The concept is very, very general and can be applied to almost
all chemicals," he said.

     Acoustic wave sensors located underneath a thin coating of the
zeolites may enable detection of substances up to the parts-per-billion
level.  This information then would be transmitted to a central control
station without removing the sensor, Bein added.

     This method of chemical monitoring has several advantages, Bein
explained.  Perhaps most importantly, it may allow for continuous and
"almost instantaneous" monitoring that could provide early warnings of
pollution.  It also may eliminate the need for human involvement in
collecting toxic samples.

     The new technology has not yet been tested in the environment.  But
the research team will be working on experimental testing devices aimed at
monitoring halogenated hydrocarbons leaking from waste dumps, Bein said.
The research group hopes to test a number of different zeolites and develop
a data bank about the different sensors.  The project is sponsored by an
Energy Department program that encourages cooperation between New Mexico
academic institutions and the two national laboratories in the state.  The
National Science Foundation provided funding for the sensor project, which
started about 30 months ago, Bein added.

     The research group's findings were presented Dec. 18 in a paper,
"Molecular Sieve Sensors for Selective Operation at the Nanogram Level," at
the 1989 International Chemical Congress of Pacific Basin Societies in
Honolulu.  For more information, contact Bein at 505/277-4935 or the
American Chemical Society at 202/872-4600.

FISHER SEES IMPORTANT ROLE FOR
INTERNATIONAL CHEMICAL TESTING

     A recent international agreement to test 150 industrial chemicals won
praise as an "interesting and important development in chemical testing and
con-trol" from Linda Fisher, the Environmental Protection Agency's
assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic substances.

     She cited this pact, under which member nations of the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) agreed to
determine the chemicals' adverse effects by 1994, as one of her three
priorities for administering the Toxic Substances Control Act.  (For
details on the OECD agreement, see TMN, Nov. 22, 1989).  The others
are pollution prevention, which is being pushed across-the-board by
Administrator William Reilly, and developing a strategic plan for the
Office of Toxic Substances.

     "My [overall] priority is to take advantage of those three activities
to target, perhaps, some new approaches to TSCA -- to build on what's going
on in the international community, to take a look at how we can use TSCA to
bring about pollution prevention or better management of chemicals, and to
use the strategic plans," she told TMN in a Dec. 15 interview.

     EPA also is "looking at an initiative under [TSCA] Section 8(e) to
identify ... in industries' minds more clearly their responsibility under
that section to report to us adverse effect findings in their [chemical]
studies," Fisher said, although she provided no timetable for a possible
proposal.

EPA TO ASSESS PCB CONTAMINATION
IN HUDSON RIVER, AGENCY SAYS

     Environmental Protection Agency officials in New York City have
released plans to re-evaluate the pollution on the bottom of the Hudson
River by polychlorinated biphenyl wastes from two General Electric Corp.
plants.  The agency's Region 2 said there would be a "reassessment of
whether further cleanup activities should now appropriately be taken under
the Superfund program."

     The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has been
using a demonstration program involving the dredging of the PCB sediments
from the river and capping them in an aboveground landfill with a $20
million federal grant under the Clean Water Act.

     "EPA has decided to reassess the 1984 decision in light of additional
data developed by New York state with respect to the movement and
persistence of the PCBs in the sediments, and in recognition of recent
advances in PCB-destruction technologies such as incineration," the agency
said.  "EPA's reassessment will be carried out independently of the DEC
[capping] plan."

     But $17 million of the grant will be redirected to support New York's
wastewater treatment programs due to delays in building a landfill for the
river sediment.  "The [state] project has not moved forward as planned
because of difficulties in siting the landfill," said EPA.

     PCB wastes were released into the river in 1973 by two GE facilities
in Fort Edward, N.Y.  In 1984, EPA signed a Superfund "record of decision"
that postponed the removal of PCB-contaminated sediment from the river
bottom.  A cleanup plan calls for PCBs on the river bank to be capped in
place temporarily.

STUDY FINDS LINGERING POLLUTION
IN MIDWEST FARM-STATE STREAMS

     Toxic herbicides were found in more than half of 155 Midwestern
streams tested early last spring, the time of year when contamination
levels should be lowest, a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) study showed.

     Although fields had not been treated since the previous growing year,
55 percent of the streams tested in 10 farm states still had measurable
levels of herbicides such as atrazine and alachlor, both widely used on
corn and soybeans to control weeds.  A second round of sampling conducted
in May and June -- after fresh applications of herbicides -- found 90
percent of the streams had detect-able contamination and dozens of samples
exceeded federal health advisory standards for such residues.

     Donald Goolsby, lead study author and USGS's water quality specialist
for the central United States, said his sampling team expected to find some
contamination, but not as mush as they did.  "The surprise was the large
and widespread concentrations," he explained.  "These herbicides have been
detected before in streams in agricultural states, but we do not know of
any reports of the wide-spread occurrences found in our study."

     Agricultural chemicals should be at their lowest concentrations in the
environment in the spring, Goolsby said, speculating that the springtime
contamination may be the result of streams tapping ground water
reservoirs, where herbicide residues can persist for six months or longer.
Another explanation, he observed last week, might be related to the general
drought conditions in the Midwest over the past few years.

     "It's possible there has not been sufficient rainfall to flush them
[herbicides] from the fields," he said.  The stream contamination "could
be coming from the previous year's application."

     The study tested streams in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas,
Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin.  Those
states were chosen because they account for 60 percent of all pesticide use
in the country and produce 75 percent of the nation's corn and 60 percent
of its soybeans.

     The second round of stream testing, conducted after springtime field
spraying, found dozens of samples had concentrations of herbicide residues
above federal health advisory levels.  Of the 127 samples, 71 exceeded the
Environmental Protection Agency's health advisory level for atrazine and 44
were higher than EPA's proposed drinking water standard for alachlor.  EPA
has classified alachlor as a probable human carcinogen and atrazine as a
possible human carcinogen (Canada has banned alachlor).  The geological
survey's study was not designed to test drinking water, Goolsby noted,
although some of the sampling sites were up-stream of public water intakes.

     In addition to its unprecedented scope, the study was innovative
because it used a new enzyme-based immunoassay method for detecting
herbicide residues in water, Goolsby said.  The new method is much faster
and cheaper than the traditional gas chromotography detection technique,
and, if verified as accurate, could have a major impact on environmental
science, he said.  The immunoassay method has been used primarily in
medical research.  The USGS study team currently is analyzing a third
round of water samples collected in the late fall, when water flow
generally is lowest and streams are being fed largely by ground water.
Results from this round of testing are due this month.

BOOK DETAILS ISSUES OF
DISASTROUS AIR TOXICS RELEASES

     Noyes Data Corp. of Park Ridge, New Jersey, has published a manual
called Accidental Releases of Air Toxics that compiles "the technical
information that is necessary for developing approaches to preventing and
controlling accidental releases."  The 649-page volume offers a brief
history of toxic chemical re?leases, an overview of the accidental release
problem, methods commonly used in hazard identification and evaluation, and
a summary of the general principles of hazard control.

     The book, written by six analysts from the Radian Corp. of Austin,
Texas, also identifies primary industrial chemicals of concern and
discusses fundamental causes of toxic releases.

     A major section of the manual addresses "prevention technologies,"
with chapters on process design considerations, physical plant design
considerations, and protection technologies such as flares, scrubbers, and
enclosures.  A section on "mitigation measures" features reports on
emergency planning and training, facility layout, detection systems, vapor
dispersion modeling, meteorological instrumentation, and secondary
containment.

     "Costs of identification, evaluation, inspection, and control
technologies can be used to roughly estimate costs of various programs for
accidental release prevention and control by either regulatory agencies or
companies," the authors state in a chapter entitled "Cost Implications for
Policy Planning." The book presents data and methodologies "to provide
companies with a rough measure of cost impacts of various process control
options."

     Accidental Releases of Air Toxics is available from Noyes
Publications, Mill Road at Grand Ave., Park Ridge, N.J. 07656.  The cost is
$86.

COURT ORDERS TRIPLE DAMAGES
FOR CLEANUP OF PCB WASTES

     A North Carolina man and his son have been ordered by a federal judge
to pay the federal government three times its costs of cleaning up
polychlorinated biphenyl wastes at a Fayetteville site.

     The Environmental Protection Agency spent $268,000 from Superfund to
remove PCB wastes from a former transformer reclamation site owned by Dewey
Strother of Fayetteville.  A federal district court has ordered Strother
and his son Kenneth to pay $804,000 under Section 107 of the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.

     In addition, the Strothers must pay a fine of $78,000, or three times
the $26,000 civil penalty assessed against them in 1984 for violating the
Toxic Substances Control Act.  The two men also must reimburse the
government three times all future cleanup costs at the site and three times
the government's legal costs, the Justice Department said.

STATE COURT THROWS OUT N.Y. RULE
ON POSTED PESTICIDE WARNINGS

     A controversial New York regulation that would require farms, hotels,
offices, residential buildings and restaurants to post notices before and
after pesticide use was rejected Dec. 21 by the Appellate Division of the
New York State Supreme Court.  Several groups representing the affected
industries sued the state over the proposed rule.

     The rule could not go into effect because the state Department of
Environmental Conservation had not not fully assessed the environmental
impact of the regulation, as required by law, the court said.  The court
also ruled that the DEC did not file the regulations on time.  Under the
decision, the department may have to repeat the public hearing process for
the regulation.

     State officials have not yet decided whether to appeal the decision to
New York's highest court, said R.W. Groneman, a DEC spokesman.  DEC did not
prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the rule because state
officials felt it would "have little or no adverse effect on the
environment."

     Agriculture groups, however, said the posting of signs might impede
farmers from using integrated pest management (IPM), which relies on the
quick and judicious use of chemicals.  Since the final version of the rules
would require only four hours' notice, instead of the 24-hour notice
originally proposed, DEC does not feel the law would impeded IPM, Groneman
said.

     But the court agreed with the farm groups.  "While it is true that DEC
may have considered the IPM program in promulgating the regulations, the
evidence in the record decisively demonstrates that the regulations would
have a major adverse impact on the IPM program, that DEC knew of this
evidence and that, therefore, an EIS was required to explore the entire
issue thoroughly," Justice Norman Harvey wrote in his opinion for the court
(his emphasis).

     DEC continues to support the concept behind the regulations, which
would require commercial establishments and farms to post notices informing
the public a few hours before pesticides are used and keep the notices
posted up to a full day after they are applied, Groneman said.  "The public
has a right to know about these dangerous chemicals that are, quite
frankly, used to kill things," he said, adding that this information can
mean "life or death" to allergic individuals.  Hotel and restaurant groups
had argued the signs would discourage business, but the state maintains the
public would quickly become acclimated to the notices, Groneman added.

THE UNITED STATES indicted 101 corporations and individuals for
environmental crimes in 1989, the Justice Department said last week.  This
is a slight decline in the number of indictments obtained in the previous
two years, however.  There were 127 indictments in 1987 and 124 in 1988,
the department said.  Government prosecutors negotiated guilty pleas or won
convictions in 107 cases.  The convictions and pleas resulted in individual
defendants being sentenced to a total of 37 years in prison.  The courts
assessed fines totaling $13 million.  The government has obtained
convictions or guilty pleas against 127 corporations and 305 individuals
since 1983.  The individuals have been sentenced to a total of 270 years in
prison, the department said.  It assessed criminal fines of more than $26
million since 1983, the first full year of operations for the Justice
Department's environmental crimes section.

department had referred the allegations to the state's attorney general,
whose interest led EPC to start releasing the most toxic portion of its

allegations by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that the
company's Palmerton, Pa., metal extracting operations violated OSHA's lead
standard and other safety and health requirements.  Under the agreement
reached last month, the company and the United Steelworkers of America
jointly will conduct a training program on lead hazards for all management

controls to address issues raised in the citations.  The agreement includes
these allegedly "willful" violations:  over-exposures to lead; improper
respirator selections; lack of engineering controls for lead; defective
lead medical monitoring and removal programs; and failure to provide
protective clothing.  The company must correct cited violations by June 30.
OSHA defines a willful violation "as one in which an employer either knew
that a condition constituted a violation or was aware that a hazardous
condition existed and made no reasonable effort to correct it."  OSHA
originally proposed fining Zinc Corp.  $1.9 million last March for 295
alleged willful violations of the lead standard.

N.J. EXPANDS PSE&G STANDARD OFFER PLAN TO 150 MW FOR 1996-97, AT AVOIDED
COST

The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities has voted to continue Public
Service Electric & Gas' ``standard offer'' program, and has expanded the
offering for 1996-97 (Docket No. EE95090415).
   Under the plan, PSE&G makes blocks of capacity available for energy
savings and pays its avoided cost to demand-side management projects. The
program began in 1993, when the utility opened a 150-MW block through 1995,
and in its recent order, the BPU expanded that to 185 MW for projects
submitted by Jan. 2, 1996. For its 1996 DSM plan, PSE&G had proposed
opening a new one-year, 75-MW block (DSR, 12 Oct '95, 1), but the BPU
expanded that to 150 MW for 1996-97.
   The new 150-MW offer will be broken into three 50-MW blocks, which will
provide declining payments, since additional capacity will reduce the value
of savings to the company, and thereby, its avoided cost. That figure now
stands at $5.45/kW/month for capacity and about 2.6 cents/kWh for energy.
However, the first 50-MW block of the new standard offer will set prices
27% lower, while the second block will be priced 33% below Standard Offer
No. 1 and the third block will be set 38% below it.
   Although Standard Offer No. 2 is set at 150 MW, the BPU made allowance
for a fourth block with no defined MW size, at prices that would be 44%
lower than Standard Offer No. 1. In addition, there will be a 15-MW
residential ``carve-out,'' with at least half of that reserved for
low-income residences. For those projects, prices will be set 14% higher
than Standard Offer No. 1 for the first half of the contract period, and
33% lower for the second half.
   Further, PSE&G will accept up to 10 MW of fuel-switching projects, but
only at government-owned facilities. It will also accept up to 1 MW of
projects that displace electric air conditioning in summer with chillers
powered by waste heat from cogeneration plants. These must involve existing
cogeneration facilities that exceed 50% efficiency, and they must not
result in incremental fuel use or emissions.
   If New Jersey opens up retail competition, PSE&G will continue to make
standard offer payments to projects whose hosts choose an electric supplier
other than the utility. However, that pledge would only apply if PSE&G is
still allowed to recover its standard offer payments through some type of
system benefits charge. DSM advocates in many states are lobbying for such
charges on distribution services, to maintain efficiency programs in the
face of retail access.
   In the standard offer program, projects are accepted on a first-come,
first-served basis, though they must be qualified by PSE&G for technical
merit and savings potential. They may be installed by users themselves, or
by energy service companies. One ESCO that is active in the program is
PSE&G's own subsidiary, Public Service Conservation Resources Corp.
(PSCRC), which works with customers on standard offer projects and provides
financing.
   In pushing for the continuation of its standard offer program, PSE&G
argued that the market-based approach fits well in the rapidly deregulating
industry. It told the BPU that ``given the right information, price signals
and product and service options, consumers are in the best position to make
decisions about how they should use and conserve energy.''
   It added that the ``decentralized decision-making of a market economy''
would stimulate innovation and reduce costs.
   There is no set budget for the standard offer program, since it will
depend on how much savings PSE&G purchases. However, the BPU approved a
$33-million, two-year budget for the utility to continue some ``core''
programs, such as rebates for lighting and air conditioning retrofits.
   PSE&G's plan was applauded by DSM advocates, including the Mid-Atlantic
Energy Project and N.J. Public Interest Research Group, who also praised
the utility's willingness to work with them. ``PSE&G's DSM plan, and the
process by which it was developed, should serve as a model for other
utilities in New Jersey and around the country,'' stated Daniel Rosenblum,
director of the Mid-Atlantic Energy Project.

CALIF. RESTRUCTURING PROPOSAL CALLS ON LAWMAKERS TO ENACT DSM SURCHARGE

   The California Public Utilities Commission called on the California
Legislature to enact a nonbypassable ``public goods'' surcharge on retail
electricity sales to fund energy efficiency and research and development
programs in a competitive electric industry.
   The PUC made the recommendation in its final restructuring order issued
December 20. The commission also recommended that the Legislature adopt a
separate universal surcharge to fund low-income weatherization programs
currently funded through utility demand-side management budgets.
   The commission gave the Legislature, Governor, stakeholders, and the
public 100 days to comment on its decision while the PUC establishes a
``road map'' for implementing restructuring in California. ``Given the
Legislature's role in creating these programs, we do not view it
appropriate to alter them significantly without Legislative guidance,'' the
PUC stated.
   The PUC plans to adopt a funding level, establish an independent
administrator for the DSM and R&D funds, and work out other details during
the implementation phase of restructuring. However, the PUC suggested that
the public goods surcharge should be equal to three percent of total
revenues from electricity sales in California.
   The PUC noted that while support for a nonbypassable surcharge to fund
energy efficiency and conservation programs remained strong, stakeholders
disagreed on the types of programs that should be funded and the
appropriate funding levels.
   The PUC specified that funding for energy efficiency programs should
focus on activities not provided by the competitive market that are in the
broad public interest and designed to transform the energy efficiency
market. The commission conceded that delineating between competitive and
other DSM activities will be difficult.
   ``We do not intend for the surcharge to collect funds to pursue energy
efficiency activities that the competitive market will provide on its
own,'' the PUC said. However, the commission observed that ``many programs
with a market transformation, information, or education focus are not
likely to be provided by the competitive market.''
   While acknowledging that there are various definitions of market
transformation activities, the commission concluded that it was appropriate
to use public funding to ensure that consumers have information about
managing their energy use. Residential and small business customers
generally have a greater need for these public programs than large
customers, which have greater resources available to manage their energy
use, the PUC noted. Moreover, financial incentives to develop the market
for energy efficient products and services, such as the Super-Efficient
Refrigerator Program and manufacturer rebates for fluorescent light-bulbs
and high-efficiency motors should continue, the PUC suggested. ``We expect
that public funding would be needed only for specified and limited periods
of time, to cause the market to be transformed,'' the PUC said.
   The PUC adopted a two-track approach to continuing DSM funding in a
competitive industry. In the short-term the commission plans to utilize the
utilities' expertise in administering DSM programs. However, after a short
transition period, the PUC plans to establish an independent, nonprofit
organization to collect the surcharge and allocate the funds competitively
to ensure equal opportunity for non-utility energy service companies.
   The PUC anticipates that by January 1, 1997 DSM costs will no longer be
embedded in electric rates but will be collected as part of the public
goods surcharge on retail electricity sales. Initially, the surcharge
should be a line item on utility bills corresponding to each utility's
authorized DSM funding in their service area. In time the PUC intends for
the same surcharge to be applied consistently throughout the state.
   The commission plans to hold workshops to provide guidance on
establishing the DSM programs that will be funded through the surcharge,
the details of the independent administrator and transition period, and how
utility expertise can be utilized.
   ``This guidance should be considered a starting point and not final,''
the PUC said. ``If the workshops flesh out the two tracks in more detail
and identify areas where public funding should be expanded or limited, we
will consider modifying our decision.''
   The PUC noted that the California Energy Commission is also
deliberating--through its Energy Services Working Group--how best to
promote energy efficiency in a competitive electric industry. The CEC
working group has recommended a surcharge to fund DSM and energy efficiency
R&D beginning January 1, 1996 while supporting more market-driven funding
approaches. The working group recommended that the PUC continue to oversee
utility DSM expenditures until 1998 while market structure details are
worked out.

MANY STATES REJECT EPACT STANDARDS ON DSM, IRP AND EFFICIENCY IN SUPPLY

   Many states have rejected the efficiency guidelines set down in the 1992
Energy Policy Act (EPACT), saying they conflict with existing state
regulations, according to a recent survey.
   St. Louis consulting firm Brubaker & Associates Inc. (BAI) polled state
commissions and found that almost twice as many states rejected the EPACT
standards as adopted them. However, most commissions took no action,
explaining that they were already in compliance with the standards before
EPACT was passed by Congress in 1992.
   In Section 111 of the act, Congress stated three efficiency standards
(7,8 and 9): integrated resource planning (IRP) should be employed by each
utility, and plans should be updated regularly, providing for public
participation; investments in conservation and demand-side management
should be at least as profitable as supply-side resources, giving
consideration to reduced sales, and should be monitored and evaluated;
energy efficiency investments in power generation and supply should be
encouraged by providing incentives for better maintenance and investments
in efficient generation, transmission and distribution.
   EPACT called for states to consider these guidelines and determine
whether adopting them would be consistent with state law. States were also
told to determine whether adopting the standards would advance conservation
and maintain equitable rates to electricity consumers. The act set a
deadline of Oct. 24, 1995 for these investigations.
   In its survey, Brubaker found that 12 states rejected the IRP standard,
seven adopted it and most others said they were already in compliance (some
had not yet ruled). Similarly, 12 states rejected the criterion for
investments in DSM, while 7 states adopted it and others either said they
were already in compliance or had not yet addressed the issue. On
efficiency in generation, 12 states rejected while only five adopted.
   States that rejected all three standards are: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas,
Delaware, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, North
Dakota, Virginia and West Virginia. Those that adopted all three standards
are: Florida, Idaho, Oklahoma and Wyoming. However, several others adopted
the IRP and DSM standards, while rejecting or reaching no decision the last
one, including Colorado, Connecticut and Indiana. Those states that said
they were already in compliance with all standards are: Georgia, Hawaii,
Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South
Carolina and Vermont.

PS COLORADO OFFERS GAS DRYER REBATES

   Public Service Colorado has inaugurated a natural gas dryer rebate
program that provides $70 to first-time buyers or those replacing an
electric clothes dryer.
   The two-month program expiring Dec. 31, 1995 is part of the company's
demand-side management efforts to help customers use energy wisely.
   ``Customers can dry almost three loads of laundry in a natural gas dryer
for what it costs to dry one load in an electric dryer,'' said Kathy
Worthington, marketing program leader at PS Colorado. The offer is
available only to residential customers of the company.

PEPCO PROVIDES $250,000 TO NON-PROFITS

   Potomac Electric Power spent $250,000 in 1995 to help subsidize the
weatherization of homes belonging to low-income and senior customers. Over
the past 12 years, the utility has helped weatherize more than 20,000
homes, working in conjunction with charitable groups.
   Under its Community Conservation Program, the company awarded contracts
worth $250,000 in 1995 to non-profit, community-based organizations to do
the work. Matching funds from private organizations brought the total
budget up to about $1-million for the year.

N.Y. ALJ BACKS SYSTEM BENEFITS CHARGE TO FUND DSM AS COMPETITION OPENS UP

   An administrative law judge at the New York Public Service Commission
has recommended imposing a mechanism to fund demand-side management as the
state opens up competition. She also emphasized wholesale, rather than the
retail competition that DSM advocates fear would encourage cheap, dirty
power.
   ALJ Judith Lee issued her proposed decision in the PSC's Competitive
Opportunities case (No. 94-E-0952). In it, she stated that ``Retail
competition has the potential to benefit all customers by providing greater
choice among their electricity providers, as well as increased pricing and
reliability options. But retail access brings with it significant risks and
requires considerable caution, and should be provided only if it is in the
best interests of all consumers.''
   With that note of caution, she urged the PSC to establish wholesale
competition first, ``with an eye toward adding retail access as rapidly as
possible once a market is established and reliability is ensured.''
However, she offered no time frame for the transition, and retail wheeling
advocates--such as large industrials--bitterly condemned the decision,
saying it gives utilities veto power over moves toward retail access.
   In earlier comments in the case, DSM advocates joined the utilities in
endorsing a wholesale pool, rather than retail access (DSR, 9 Nov '95, 7).
They argued that deregulation ``must protect the long-term economic and
environmental health of the state, and not focus entirely on short-term
price considerations.'' With a wholesale pool, they said, regulators would
have more control over resource choices, and could insist that distribution
utilities acquire a certain amount of DSM and renewables. They could also
impose a ``system benefits charge'' on retail rates to fund DSM and
renewables.
   But even if retail competition were allowed, distribution utilities
would still deliver power from outside producers, and regulators could
impose the system benefits charge or ``wires charge'' on those deliveries,
the efficiency groups said. In her proposed decision, Judge Lee opened the
door for the option: ``Any restructuring model should include a mechanism
for recovering costs required to be spent on environmental and other public
policy considerations.''
   The ALJ ruling was praised by David Wooley, executive director of Pace
Energy Project, at the Pace University Center for Environmental Legal
Studies in White Plains, N.Y. He said Judge Lee was ``appropriately
cautionary'' about the transition to retail competition. Further, ``She has
clearly endorsed a system benefits charge, and that was one of our main
objectives,'' he told Demand-Side Report.
   Wooley foresees a system benefits charge of 1.5-2 mills/kWh, which he
said would have a minimal rate impact. The funds could be administered by a
non-profit entity, a ``quasi-governmental'' entity whose board would
contain representatives of all customer sectors. Wooley does not rule out
utilities overseeing DSM efforts, but he fears any link between the
distribution company and its generation affiliate, which might oppose DSM.
``It's not impossible to erect barriers, but we're concerned because the
generating company would see DSM as competition, just it would see other
generators as competition,'' he said.
   Wooley is skeptical of the argument--often advance by retail competition
advocates--that in an open market, energy service companies would
proliferate to replace utility DSM programs. ``It's not at all clear that
ESCOs would arise to take over the conservation efforts,'' he said.
``Especially during a transition period, you need mechanisms to jump-start
the market.''
   Eventually, the system benefits charge could shrink, Wooley said, but he
added, ``There will always be a place for this to bring new technologies to
the market.'' He said the 1.5-2 mills/kWh surcharge is a ``reasonable''
proposal that could benefit everyone if it is administered well.
   On that note, Wooley dismissed the notion put forth by large users that
they are non-participants in most of the programs. ``Anyone who buys
commercial lighting has benefited from DSM efforts,'' he said. ``The market
has advanced, and what is standard now is very different from what was
standard a few years ago.'' To continue that market transformation, DSM
funds could go to equipment manufacturers, as well as users, to subsidize
efficiency upgrades in their product lines, he said.

UTILITIES MUST SHIFT INDUSTRIAL DSM TO CUSTOMER SERVICE, REPORT ADVISES

   Although utilities are under pressure to cut costs in the competitive
market, they must view industrial demand-side management as a means of
retaining these customers in that same tough environment, according to a
recent report.
   However, DSM must be shifted from a ``resource procurement'' strategy to
a customer-service approach, says IRT Environment Inc.. The Basalt, Colo.,
information and consulting firm surveyed manufacturers and utilities and
found that they are far apart on what industrial DSM should include.
   The problem is urgent, IRT says, because industrials are utilities'
``least captive'' customers, with options for fuel switching, cogeneration,
and shifting loads to other regions. Most of them are unhappy paying for
DSM in the first place, and say they do not even get much for these rate
hikes. Many large manufacturers have been pursuing energy conservation for
years, IRT notes, and they condemn rate-based DSM as a subsidy for
others--including competing industrial firms that have not taken the same
initiative. ``Utilities have been regarded by many industrial customers as
vestiges of a socialist system, monopolies used to deliver not only
electricity but public policy,'' IRT says.
   Part of the problem is that utility DSM programs are often rigid,
providing audits and rebates for motors and lighting, but not improving
processes, the report notes. This type of work is much more difficult
because processes can differ greatly from industry to industry, and even
from company to company within an industry. Process improvements demand the
kind of customized services that utilities must provide in the more
competitive market, according to the report. These should transcend energy
efficiency, and also focus on productivity improvements and pollution
control, IRT advises. However, utilities are still likely to encounter
hostility. In interviewing industrials, IRT found that some doubt utilities
are capable of providing effective energy services, since they have no
entrepreneurial skills. They think utilities should just get out of the way
and stop hiking rates for programs that are unwanted. At best, utilities
can promote efficiency through information, cost-based rates and financing,
some firms said.
   To overcome industrial skepticism, some utilities are contracting with
existing energy service companies or even acquiring existing ESCOs. They
may offer energy services outside of rate base through unregulated
subsidiaries. Others are using consultants with expertise in particular
industries to help their customers.
   Another approach is taken by Niagara Mohawk Power in New York, which
allows industrials to opt out of DSM rebate programs and avoid the rate
impact. However, the utility will link these customers with private ESCOs,
and will help them line up financing for efficiency projects. Meanwhile,
Detroit Edison has made efficiency part of the long-term supply contracts
it has signed with the ``Big 3'' automakers. The utility will provide 38
on-site energy managers, and has already seen $1-million in savings at
several facilities in a limited test of the program.
   The report, ``Industrial Efficiency Programs: Building Strategic
Partnerships,'' is available for $100 from The Results Center, IRT
Environment Inc., P.O. Box 2239, Basalt, Colo. 81621; (970) 927-3155.

NRDC PUSHING ENERGY EFFICIENCY PLAN IN LONG ISLAND LIGHTING RESTRUCTURING

   The Natural Resources Defense Council and other groups are lobbying the
Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) to emphasize energy efficiency in its
restructuring of Long Island Lighting.
   Concerned by the utility's high rates--averaging 15.3 cents/kWh--and
their impact on the economy, New York Gov. George Pataki has called for the
dismantling of the utility. He recently proposed a plan that calls for LIPA
to take over LILCO's distribution system, auction off its generating
plants, and shop around for the cheapest power in the wholesale market.
   However, NRDC, the Long Island Citizens Advisory Panel (CAP) and other
DSM proponents stress that the governor's plan only predicts 12% rate
reductions, which will not nearly bring rates in line with regional or
national averages. The only way to help businesses and residences is to cut
their bills by aggressively pursuing DSM, they argue (DSR, 7 Dec, 3).
   Presenting the breakup plan, neither Gov. Pataki nor LIPA chairman James
Gill mentioned energy efficiency. However, Ashok Gupta, senior energy
economist for New York-based NRDC, told Demand-Side Report that he has
gotten a good reception at LIPA and has further meetings planned for early
in the new year.
   In an outline of its Long Island Energy Efficiency Initiative, NRDC
notes that the State Energy Plan estimates the savings potential on Long
Island at $400-million per year, but ``without technical and financial
assistance, these economic investments appear difficult, risky and
expensive,'' it warns. Some subsidies are needed because ``High transaction
costs, scarcity and cost of capital, lack of expertise, split incentives
and other related hurdles stand in the way of private-sector investment in
energy efficiency.''
   To overcome those hurdles, NRDC has proposed a fund that would financed
through through a 0.2 cents/kWh rate surcharge. That would raise
$32-million per year over five years, or $160-million, which could be
administered by LIPA and the New York Power Authority (NYPA). However, all
energy services and products would be delivered by private energy service
companies.
   Incentives would serve as a marketing tool for ESCOs, and these would be
made available on a first-come, first-served basis, so that ``energy
service companies will in essence race to enroll new projects, generating a
quick market upsurge,'' NRDC predicts. LIPA, or whatever entity takes over
LILCO's distribution system, would let ESCOs collect payments from
consumers through their monthly electric bills.
   Part of the efficiency fund could be used to guarantee loans by private
lenders, to make capital more accessible and hold down interest rates,
according to the plan. The financial institutions could collect these loans
through electric bills, and payments could be timed so that users pay them
off through energy savings.
   In addition, LIPA could provide ``energy savings advances.'' Under this
scheme, when consumers sign contracts with ESCOs, they would be given
interest-free advances of 10% of their total investment, to be repaid
through future bills.
   The initiative would also provide coupons to cut the cost of purchases,
such as efficient lighting, refrigerators and other appliances. ``Though
purchases of such equipment often pay for themselves out of saved energy
costs, their higher up-front cost often deters consumers,'' NRDC notes.
Some coupons could be given to landlords, to encourage efficient purchases,
since renters usually have no say in their appliances, even though they pay
the bills. Other funds could be used to support design assistance for
architects and builders, and to accelerate the introduction of new
technologies.
   Overall, NRDC sees the initiative providing an additional 10% reduction
in energy bills, as well as stimulating private-sector investment worth
$1-billion, helping businesses become more competitive and creating jobs in
energy services and construction.

CONSULTANTS SEE NEED FOR UTILITIES TO RETHINK TRADITIONAL BUSINESS

   ``Electric utilities are dead,'' according to Mitch Diamond, vice
president, energy group, at Booz, Allen & Hamilton Inc., the New York
City-based consulting firm.
   In their stead are a number of distinct businesses that traditional
investor-owned utilities can choose to participate in or not as the
industry restructures, Diamond said. Whereas utilities now vertically
integrate generation, transmission, distribution and customer service,
these and other business functions will evolve into separate business
enterprises, in the form of power production companies, regional network
operators, bulk power traders, distribution system operators and retail
power marketers.
   Diamond made his remarks at the ``Competitive Analysis and Benchmarking
for Power Companies'' conference last month, sponsored by the Boston-based
Center for Business Intelligence in Washington D.C. The conference brought
together a number of consultants and utility executives to talk about the
integration of competitive intelligence techniques into the utility
industry as restructuring and deregulation progresses.
   Diamond said utilities should concentrate on organizing themselves to do
better in the future what they have already done in the past. To accomplish
this, a lot of analysis and hard thinking will be required, he said. He
suggested that executives decide which parts of the business they are best
at and concentrate on them, leaving the parts that they are weakest at to
other companies.
   He cautioned against a strategy pursued by several major utilities in
the industry: going overseas to build power plants in developing countries.
``Your business is not to go build plants in Argentina,'' he said, ``but to
be better in the business you're now in, here in the states.''
   To back up his claim, he presented data suggesting that the best
performers in different industries consistently outperform by wide margins
the average performance within those industries. In effect, he said,
pursuing international development opportunities may provide short-term
windfalls, but to the possible detriment of the work necessary to excel at
home.
   And to excel in the native market, he said, utilities must become more
customer-sensitive and willing to tailor their services to individual
customers' needs. In his company's analysis, he said it was discovered
that, across a variety of industries, customers switch providers as much,
if not more so, because of poor service as because of price differences. He
said the way to ensure the least amount of customer flight is to treat
customers as individuals, learn their individual needs and respond to them.
That way, when a new supplier woos them, the bond of loyalty and
recognition will be harder to break.
   Also speaking at the conference was Sanford Cohen, an analyst at Merrill
Lynch, who presented a regional analysis of how 50 utilities stand in terms
of their industrial power prices.
   In the mid-Atlantic region, Merrill Lynch found that Allegheny Power,
with ``among the lowest price and cost structures in the nation,'' was
strongest, with Baltimore Gas & Electric, Pennsylvania Power and & Light,
DQE and PECO Energy also strong. The analyst forecast that PECO Energy,
Public Service Enterprise Group and DQE would soon bring their current high
prices ``in-line with regional averages.'' Most at risk because of
competition in the region were General Public Utilities and Public Service
Electric & Gas.
   The Midwest, Merrill Lynch said, is ``another area that is primed for
competition.'' It noted Ohio Edison, Detroit Edison and DQE as expected
good performers. Most at risk is CMS Energy.
   In the Northeast, the analyst firm found no utilities in good
competitive positions. ``By national standards,'' it said, ``all of the
utilities in the Northeast have high prices. These price levels are not
going unnoticed by customers in the region. More than any other region, the
problems of the Northeast are homogeneous and it is in each utility's
interest to stall retail wheeling as long as possible.'' It picked
Northeast Utilities as the utility with the greatest chance to improve its
position.
   In the Southeast, Merrill Lynch picked Carolina Power & Light as most
likely to improve, although it is currently ``the weakest of regional
competitors. Improvements in nuclear performance coupled with large
reductions in O&M budgets over the next several years should help improve
the company's cost structure. Prices will also decline dramatically due to
the expiration of riders for nuclear investment recovery, as well as
expected discounting for industrial customers.'' It picked Southern Company
and Duke Power as presently best equipped to handle competition.
   In the region including Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas, the analyst found
that Entergy is showing the greatest improvement. It said its analysis in
this region was otherwise incomplete.
   And in the West, the analyst found that California utilities are highly
at risk because of power-purchase contracts and commitments to costly
nuclear facilities, a situation not likely to improve, despite ``heroic
efforts...to reduce price levels,'' because of the huge interconnected grid
in the West availing customers of cheaper supplies from Canada and Mexico
and elsewhere in the region.

COINCIDENT PEAK RATES HELP N.C. MUNI LOWER ITS WHOLESALE POWER COSTS

   The municipal utility in Greenville, N.C., said that
coincident-peak-based rates it charges all large industrial, commercial and
institutional customers has helped the muni realize significant savings in
its wholesale power costs, which are based in large part on Greenville's
peak demand each month.
   The Greenville Utilities Commission, as the muni is known, also said it
hopes to trim peak-period demand even more with a residential time-of-use
rate available beginning this month to 200 partipants in a pilot test.
   Roger Jones, general manager of the Greenville muni, said all muni
customers that demand 750 kW or more now pay one of three coincident peak
(CP) rates: An ``A'' rate for those whose energy use must be relatively
constant; a ``B'' rate for those with more flexibility; and a ``C'' rate
for those willing and able to make significant reductions in their energy
use during coincident peaks.
   Under each rate, the customer pays a basic monthly charge of $440, plus
a relatively high per/kW rate for its demand during the 60 minutes each
month when the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency (NCEMPA)--the
muni's wholesale supplier--experiences its highest systemwide demand.
   The customer also pays a much smaller per/kW charge for difference
between that coincident-peak level and its highest demand for all that
month, plus energy charges.
   For instance, under the ``C'' rate, a 3-MW customer that reduces its
coincident-peak demand to 1 MW pays a $440 basic charge, plus demand
charges of $21.34/kW on the 1-MW coincident-peak demand and $2.86/kW on the
2 MW above that level. The customer also pays an energy charge of 3.323
cents/kWh.
   Jones said that the muni's 750-kW and higher customers together account
for about one-quarter of Greenville's total energy use, and that the CP
rates have encouraged them to reduce their peak-period demand by 15 to 20%
from what it typically would have been without the CP rates.
   He noted that reduction translates directly into savings in the
wholesale power costs paid by Greenville to NCEMPA, which buys most of its
power from Carolina Power & Light.
   The magnitude of reductions in coincident-peak demand varied widely from
customer to customer, the muni manager said. Some are able only to trim
their demand slightly, while others have been ``very aggressive'' and have
slashed peak-period demand by more than 50%.
   One large industrial customer that typically demands about 8 MW reduces
its demand to between 1 and 1.5 MW during coincident peaks, Jones noted,
saving both the customer and the muni thousands of dollars in monthly power
costs.
   The residential time-of-use rate program Greenville is now pilot-testing
also is aimed at reducing peak-period demand and wholesale power costs.
   Jones said the pilot requires that participants sign up for the muni's
``Beat-the-Peak'' load-management program, under which load-control
switches are placed on customers' heat pumps, electric furnaces, central
air conditioners and electric water heaters, and those devices are remotely
switched off during peak periods.
   The TOU program sets on-peak and off-peak energy-use hours for three
different times of the year. On-peak hours are 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. during the
months of January, February, March, November and December; 1 p.m. to 7 p.m.
in May, June, July, August and September; and 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
to 7 p.m. in April and October.
   Participants pay a basic customer charge of $13.09/month, plus 6.449
cents/kWh for off-peak energy and 17.402 cents/kWh for on-peak energy. The
standard residential rate, in comparison, features a basic customer charge
of $8.09/month, plus energy charges of 9.473 cents for all kWh used from
July through October, and 8.257 cents for all kWh used the rest of the
year.
   Jones said he expects the residential TOU pilot to make at least a
slight contribution to lowering Greenville's peak-period demand, and
anticipates that after a year-long test and perhaps some adjustments, a
residential TOU rate is likely to be offered on a much wider scale in
1997.
   He added, however, that unlike the CP rate for large energy users, the
muni ``for the foreseeable future'' is likely to give residential customers
a choice between standard and a TOU rates.

SDG&E RETROFITS LIGHTS AT 175 SCHOOLS; SAVINGS ESTIMATED AT
$1.8-MILLION/YEAR

   San Diego Gas & Electric has completed an $11-million lighting retrofit
project at 175 schools in the San Diego Unified School District and
officials expect an annual savings of $1.8-million in energy bills.
   The utility said the project, largest of its type on the SDG&E system,
is expected to conserve 16.2 million kWh each year. Under SDG&E's
demand-side management incentive program, shareholders will receive about
$2-million more in earnings, the company said.
   The installations in each school included energy-efficient fluorescent
lamps, ballasts and fixtures in offices and classrooms. Also, occupancy
sensors in classrooms ensure lights are automatically turned off when not
in use. Exit signs also are saving energy with light-emitting diode kits.
   Gregg Lawless, SDG&E marketing account executive who served as team
leader for the lighting retrofit, said employees working on the project
used faster and better approaches.
   ``We broke some rules,'' Lawless said. ``The project's one-year time
line may seem long at first, but not when you recall that there are 175
schools. That's two days per school for the retrofits of all classrooms and
offices--to get done without disrupting classes.'' Lawless said, ``We
moved fast, took risks and emphasized a high level of teamwork, both
internally and with our contractors and the school district.''
   As an example, he said, SDG&E's procurement agents ``moved us through
the selection of contractors and bidding very quickly. It can be a
cumbersome process, but they did it in less than 60 days.'' Another key
factor in the project success, Lawless said, was excellent communication,
especially by SDG&E's team of energy consultants led by Kraig Akers.
   Lawless said, ``Akers and his team completed the audits for all 175
schools, they calculated the estimated energy savings and they determined
our incentives for the customer.'' On this project, he said, each energy
audit involved a representative of SDG&E, the school district and the
school district's energy consultant.
   ``The complexity of this approach,'' Lawless said, ``increased the need
for good communication. Throughout the project, we've made a point to keep
everyone up to date at all times, on all matters. It helps us to stay
focused.''
   Mike Lorch, principal of Kearny High School, said, ``There's a dramatic
change in the quality of light in classrooms and it's had a very positive
impact on morale at our school. Some teachers were so fired up, they went
out and bought supplies and painted classrooms on their own time.''

LOAD RESEARCH PROJECT SEEN MAXIMIZING DSM EFFORT FOR N.C. MUNICIPAL AGENCY

   North Carolina Municipal Power Agency No. 1, which arranges power for 19
municipal utilities in western North Carolina, said a far-reaching
load-research project it is undertaking should help the agency maximize the
effectiveness of its extensive demand-side management effort.
   Mark Otersen, NCMPA-1's supervisor of demand-side operations, said the
$250,000 project will involve the installation by this spring of new,
modified metering equipment at the agency's largest wholesale power
delivery points, as well as equipment to monitor the loads of ``well over
50'' of its munis' largest retail customers.
   The delivery-point meters--combined with telecommunications and computer
equipment to transmit and compile the meter data--will enable NCMPA-1 to
measure the demand of its muni members on a real-time, minute-by-minute
basis, he said. The customer-load monitors, in turn, will let the agency
gather information on customer demand and chart customer load
``shapes''--or patterns of demand.
   That data, Otersen said, should help NCMPA-1 design a menu of
innovative, DSM-related rates for industries with common load shapes, and
help its member munis convince large energy users of the benefits of using
such rates.
   He noted that relatively few of the large retail customers served by
munis in western North Carolina currently participate in load-management
programs that provide incentives to those who agree to let their utility
curtail or interrupt power during peak periods, or who agree to run
peak-shaving standby generators.
   With the customer-load data and newly developed rates in hand, Otersen
said, NCMPA-1 and its members ``will be able to say to a large customer,
`Here is where you are now, and here is how much you might save if you
could shift this much demand.' ''
   Also the new delivery-point meters and customer monitors could be used
to give NCMPA-1 precise data on the impact individual elements of its
overall DSM effort have on demand. For instance, he said, a muni might
implement only its load control program for standby generation, or for
residential water heaters, and be able to measure the MW difference between
demand just before controls were implemented and just after.
   In the future, with that information in hand, Otersen added, it might be
possible for NCMPA-1 and its munis to determine on some days that they only
need to implement a portion of their overall DSM effort--perhaps only
residential air-conditioner load controls--to meet their load-reduction
goals.
   Otersen and Woody Adams, the agency's power-supply manager, noted that
optimizing NCMPA-1's DSM effort really is only a side benefit of the
$250,000 load-research project, which is being undertaken primarily to
enable the agency know with considerable accuracy how much surplus energy
it has available each hour for possible sale to others on the wholesale
market.
   That knowledge will become increasingly important through the late
1990s, when the agency expects to have increasing amounts of surplus energy
available as Duke Power buys back less and less of NCMPA-1's 850-MW
entitlement to Duke's 2,200-MW Catawba nuclear power station in Clover,
S.C.

PORTLAND GENERAL TO LIMIT LIGHTING REBATES; SETS `SITE-BASED' INCENTIVES

   Portland General Electric has proposed an ``Earth Smart'' program to
provide incentives for energy-efficient commercial design; the utility will
limit its lighting rebates; and it plans to initiate ``site-based''
incentives that provide different incentives based on the sized of a
customer's facility.
   The changes to its non-residential program are not as dramatic as
expected, given that PGE has said its demand-side management target would
drop significantly in 1996, according to Lynn Plamondon, an Oregon Public
Utility Commission staff member. The company said earlier it would
make the transition from a target of 20 MW to a ``threshold goal'' of 6 MW,
which means the threshold is only a bare minimum (DSR, 28 Sept '95, 8).
   Plamondon noted that PGE's least-cost plan, which includes the proposal
to lower DSM goals, has not yet been ``acknowledged'' by the Oregon PUC.
   ``The company's goals will be controversial. Their target is up to 6 MW.
I am not sure we will go for that. I have seen the higher targets push them
to do more. If they have target of 5 or 6 MW, I am not sure they will be
pushed to do that.''
   In it proposed changes to its nonresidential programs, PGE wants to
begin the Earth Smart commercial program. ``The goal of the program is to
encourage construction of commercial buildings with the highest level of
cost-effective energy efficiency and environmental sensitivity,'' says a
commission memo.
   Earth Smart is expected to save 1.2 average megawatts annually at a
total resource cost of 2.2 cents/kWh and a utility program cost of 1.4
cents/kWh. The cost-effectiveness limit is 3.1 cents/kWh, according to the
memo.
   It will be offered at two levels: one, the ``gold'' option applies to
buildings that produce energy savings at least 30% above the Oregon Energy
Code. The ``green'' option applies to buildings yielding savings at least
20% above the code.
   Customized financial incentives for architectural design assistance, an
integrated package of energy efficient building and equipment measures and
building commissioning will be included, according to the staff memo.
Customer incentives plus other program costs are limited to either 50% of
the project's incremental costs or 2 cents/kWh, whichever is lower.
   In addition, PGE wants to revise its lighting program rebates to reflect
changes in equipment costs, practices, equipment availability and new
energy efficiency lighting measures. Lighting rebates will only go to
commercial buildings and industrial facilities of less than 20,000 square
feet. Customized incentives for lighting and other energy efficiency
measures will be available to owners of facilities larger than 20,000
square feet based on the economics of the project, according to the staff
memo.
   PGE also wants to implement different incentives based on the size of
the facility. ``The purpose of the program is to allow PGE more flexibility
in delivering energy efficiency to different target markets,'' said the
staff memo.
   Owners of buildings that are 20,000 square feet or smaller will continue
to receive incentives of up to 25% of the incremental cost for measures not
available under other demand-side management options.
   But PGE proposes to increase the minimum simple payback period from 1 to
1.5 years for measures that qualify for incentives.
   Incentives for facilities larger than 20,000 square feet will be
customized based on the economics of the project, but will not exceed 2
cents/kWh saved. ``The focus of this incentive option is on the energy
efficiency of the overall facility for proposed new construction or
retrofit projects,'' said the staff memo.
   The site-based incentives program is expected to save up to 1.4 average
MW annually. The total resource cost will be 2.9 cents/kWh and the utility
program cost will be 1.1 cents/kWh.
   The proposals are expected to be approved by the commission and go into
effect Jan. 1, 1996.

PACIFICORP OFFERS FREE EFFICIENCY MEASURES FOR ORE. APARTMENT OWNERS

   PacifiCorp has offered to provide $2.5-million in free energy-saving
measures to 10,000 apartment owners in Oregon as part of the Environmental
Technology Leadership Challenge, a national program that will be launched
in Portland, Ore., where the utility is based.
   Under the program, businesses, government organizations and non-profit
groups issue challenges designed to improve environmental quality.
   The project is sponsored by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Foundation and
funded by a number of businesses, said Curt Nichols, senior energy program
manager for the Portland Energy Office.
   The first 10,000 apartment owners who sign up will receive the free
energy-saving measures, said a spokeswoman for PacifiCorp.
   That is expected to save 2.5 MW in 1996. It is a follow-up of an earlier
program that provided free energy-saving measures to owners of multi-family
units, she said.
   In addition, PacifiCorp is working with the Portland Trail Blazers
basketball team to challenge facility managers to install state-of-the-art
energy technologies, said Nichols.
   And Philips Lighting in Portland asked public and private companies
using florescent lamps to switch to ``Econowatt'' florescent tubes that use
mercury technology.
   The lamp is said to be the first mercury florescent lamp with low
enough mercury levels to allow for non-toxic disposal.
   Similar programs will be launched in Chicago, Orlando, Fla., Chula
Vista, Calif. and Baltimore in a few weeks.

SESCO PETITIONS REGULATORS ON PG&E'S PLAN FOR OVER-COLLECTED DSM FUNDS

   SESCO Inc., the Lake Forest, N.J.-based energy service company, has
filed a protest with the California Public Utilities Commission over
Pacific Gas & Electric's proposal for distributing $23.4-million plus
interest of over-collected demand-side management funds from 1993 and
1994.
   PG&E has filed an ``advice letter'' (Document 1555-E) with the CPUC,
noting that it underspent its 1993 and 1994 electric DSM budgets by a total
of $106.9-million. The commission has already required that $83.5-million
be returned to ratepayers (Decision 94-12-047). The number was an estimate
and the CPUC directed the utility to notify it of any significant changes
in its 1994 year end balances. PG&E said it has closed out its accounts for
those years and has an additional $23.4-million in over-collected funds,
for a total of $106.9-million.
   The utility now proposes to retain the final $23.4-million and reserve
it for eventual payment to contractors participating in its ``integrated''
bidding solicitation. The pilot integrated resource bid effort is being
conducted by PG&E at the request of the CPUC to test how well supply-side
and demand-side resources can compete for the same block of capacity (DSR
13 April '95, 2; 19 Jan, 3).
   The utility maintains that if the integrated bidding contract payments
exceed the amount retained, any future unspent DSM funds would be reserved
to cover the spending. PG&E is currently engaged in contract negotiations
with 13 winning DSM bidders, representing 37 MW, at a cost of
$28.9-million, to be paid over the seven to 10 years of any completed
contracts.
   In its advice letter, PG&E said it had unsuccessfully asked the CPUC to
suspend integrated bidding because it was ``very concerned'' about entering
into long term, pay-for-performance DSM contracts at a time when the
California electric utility industry is restructuring. The utility said
that any agreement to pay for energy savings over a multi-year period could
result in an increase in stranded costs for PG&E.
   SESCO says that, while it supports the need to develop a way to deal
with the issue of long term DSM commitments under restructuring, ``we
definitely believe this advice letter is not the appropriate vehicle.'' It
notes that the utility should ``leave restructuring issues to the
restructuring docket,'' which the CPUC is considering.
   SESCO also believes that PG&E's proposal does increase rates. It also
says if a transfer of funds proceeds, the utility should provide for a
residential set aside.
   The unspent funds should be allotted at the same ratio as originally
intended, says SESCO. Residential customers provide about 35% of PG&E's
revenues, so should receive a similar portion of the unspent budget amounts
credited, says the firm. SESCO contends that the advice letter and
procedure will ``result in continuing damage to the interests of
residential customers.''
   SESCO says the 1993 and 1994 programs and budgets were approved by the
CPUC to meet needs of all ratepayers. It notes, ``instead of the transfer
of funding to an untested and unreviewed set of programs that largely
exclude residential customers, we propose that funding go to support
existing programs that have received full regulatory review and do not
discriminate against PG&E's residential customers.''

NIPSCO NEGOTIATING WITH UNNAMED PARTNER TO DEVELOP RESIDENTIAL ENERGY
SERVICES

   Northern Indiana Public Service is negotiating with an unidentified
company to develop and provide a variety of energy efficiency programs for
residential customers within its service territory.
   ``We want to give people the tools to help them manage their energy,''
said a NIPSCO spokeswoman. The Hammond-based utility has been criticized by
some consumer advocates for its less-than-enthusiastic support for
demand-side management.
   ``There's a reason for that,'' the spokeswoman told Demand-Side Report. 
``Traditional demand-side management programs, as we see them, have not
been effective.'' Consequently, if the current negotiations produce a
partnering agreement, ``we're calling it energy efficiency, not demand-side
management.''
   Whatever it is called, NIPSCO is looking to launch a pilot program in
its service territory later this year that would help residential customers
learn more about their energy usage in exchange for information about that
usage. The program would involve ``taking data you would get off a meter
and helping residential customers identify what their energy usage is,''
the spokeswoman said.
   The utility hopes to develop a ``pre-paid metering'' service it can
market to customers as well as a host of other programs, including
residential energy management. The spokeswoman declined to identify its
prospective partner except to say the company is not another utility or
utility vendor. ``We're talking about partnering with hardware and software
companies,'' she said.
   NIPSCO recently signed a five-year agreement to provide meter-reading
services to the city of Elkhart, Ind., following the completion of a
successful pilot program. Though not a DSM program, the program is an
example of how much emphasis NIPSCO is placing on meter reading, something
the utility believes it does very well.
   NIPSCO also is negotiating with other investor-owned electric utilities,
rural electric membership corporations, municipal electric systems and
water utilities to provide them with meter reading services also.

1994 SHAREHOLDER INCENTIVES APPROVED FOR SOCAL ED, PG&E, SDG&E AND SOCAL
GAS

   The California Public Utilities Commission December 20 approved
shareholder incentives for 1994 demand-side management programs of Southern
California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric and
Southern California Gas. The 1995 annual earnings assessment proceeding
constitutes the first application of the PUC's new ex post protocols to
utility DSM earnings claims. Beginning with this proceeding, the PUC
implemented a more stringent framework for evaluating savings from utility
DSM prgrams, linking new comprehensive measurements to utility earnings
from DSM shareholder incentives.
   In accordance with the new rules, utility total earnings' claims will be
based on the prior program year's achievements, with per-unit savings
measured over a 7 to 10 year period after implementation of the programs.
Utilities may recover those claims in four equal installments in rates in
the first, second, fifth, and tenth years of the proceeding.
   The PUC authorized Edison to recover $7.2-million of total shareholder
earnings from its 1994 DSM programs in four equal installments over a
10-year measurement period, with recovery of 25% or $1.8-million in 1996.
Edison estimated that its 1994 DSM programs would yield $129-million of net
benefits before earnings for $99.2 million of related program
expenditures.
   Similarly, the PUC awarded PG&E $19,317,000 for its 1994 DSM shareholder
incentive earnings to be recovered in four installments over a 10-year
measurement period. The PUC authorized PG&E to recover $4,344,038 in 1996
for its electric programs and $485,213 for its gas programs. PG&E
forecasted $202.6-million of net benefits before earnings for
$158.2-million worth of DSM program expenditures in 1994.
   The PUC awarded SDG&E $8,966,100 for its 1994 DSM shareholder incentive
earnings. As with the other utilities, the PUC authorized San Diego to
recover the total amount in four installments over a 10-year measurement
period, with recovery in 1996 of $2,189,930 for its electric programs and
$183,228 for its gas programs. SDG&E forecast $64-million in net benefits
before earnings for $30.2 million of DSM program expenditures in 1994. The
PUC likewise authorized SoCalGas to recover $2,898,000 for its 1994 DSM
shareholder incentive earnings in four installments over a 10-year
measurement period, with recovery of $714,582 in 1996. SoCal Gas projected
that its 1994 DSM programs would yield $14.8-million of net benefits for
$42.8-million of program expenditures. The PUC also approved SoCal Gas'
request to recover $7,254,000 in 1996 revenue requirements due to changes
in federal and state corporate income tax liabilities as a result of 1993
federal tax reform legislation.
   The PUC directed the utilities when feasible to consider non-price
factors along with price factors in their resource procurement. To the
extent that non-price factors developed for supply-side resources in state
resource plans affect DSM programs utilities should include them in
cost-effective analyses. Non-price factors should be included in the Rate
Impact Measure test. The PUC also directed electric utilities to publish
information on transmission and distribution costs for the purpose of
quantifying avoided costs.
   Moreover, the utilities will be required to confer with the PUC's
Division of Ratepayer Advocates and other interested stakeholders to
determine the appropriate avoided costs in their annual forecasts.
   The PUC directed the utilities to utilize the avoided cost calculation
in their annual forecasts to determine benefits and related earnings for
each DSM program.
   In other action, as part of PG&E's general rate case the PUC authorized
PG&E to spend $129.42-million for DSM programs in 1996, including
$99-million for energy efficiency programs, one-third less than the
$150-million PG&E spent on conservation programs in 1994. PG&E spent an
average $155 million-a-year for conservation programs between 1990 and
1994, and an average $123-million-a-year between 1980 and 1994. The PUC
ordered PG&E to spend $5-million for programs designed to transform the
market for energy efficient residential appliances, industrial motors, and
commercial air conditioning. PG&E had opposed spending money on market
transformation programs, arguing that the benefits were difficult to
measure and noting that the PUC has not yet developed appropriate policy or
measurement protocols.
   The PUC denied the utility's plan to spend $6.5-million in expenses plus
$12-million in capital costs to install 40,000 time-of-use meters to enable
customers to take advantage of off-peak rates. The PUC determined that the
meters would likely be rendered obsolete by technological advances
following electric restructuring because they lacked the ability to provide
real-time information and cannot be read remotely.

Biomarkers Trace
Oil Spill Sources

Biomarker compounds have long been used to identify petroleum
deposits, fingerprint the sources of oil spills, and monitor the
oil weathering process. However, in highly degraded oil, many oil
components such as the n-alkanes, branched alkanes, and PAHs can be
lost and unavailable as biomarkers.

Working with the Minerals Management Service (Washington, DC; Tel:
202/208-3983), Zhendi Wang and Merv Fingas of the Emergencies
Science Div. (Environmental Technology Centre, Environment Canada,
3439 River Road, Ottawa, Ontario, K1A 0H3, Canada) have developed
a method of using biomarker compounds such as triterpanes and
steranes, compounds which are highly resistant to weathering. The
analytical methods were designed to identify, characterize and
quantify oil samples having various forms, natures and
concentrations.

The researchers noted that using biomarkers to track the source of
spilled oil and to monitor weathered oil has several advantages as
compared to other approaches, including the following:

    Each oil type has a different compound distribution

    Triterpanes and steranes are highly resistant to degradation

    Triterpanes and steranes are accurately measured using gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry

    Biomarker compounds are often more abundant in highly
weathered oils

    Ratios of certain biomarkers can more accurately indicate the
extent of biodegradation than the traditional methods

The study showed that sources of oil spills could be tracked by
comparing the distribution patterns of biomarker compounds and the
relative ratios of selected paired hopanes in spilled oil samples
with reference oils. The researchers found that the relative ratios
of C29-hopane to C30-hopane were more resistant to degradation than
other ratioed pairs of hopanes.

C29-Hopane and C30-hopane were often the most abundant hopanes,
allowing the most accurate measurements. Comparing the ratios of
C29-hopane to C30-hopane in weathered and unweathered oil samples
resulted in a more accurate value for the degree of biodegradation
than traditional aliphatic-isoprenoid hydrocarbon ratios.  For more
information, see "Using Biomarker Compounds to Track the Source of
Spilled Oil and to Monitor the Oil Weathering process," in LC GC
[13, No. 12, 1995].

Skylab's Reversible
Transformation

Guy I. Z. Kalocsai of Skylab International Ltd. (Valletta, Malta)
has developed a method for reversibly transforming organic
compounds into a phase more suitable for subsequent handling but
from which the original organic compounds can be readily recovered.
The invention is particularly suited for the recovery and re-use of
liquid hydrocarbons, either naturally occurring or synthetic,
and/or their derivatives, and it is expected to be especially
useful in the recovery of hydrocarbons from an oil spill and for a
variety of other applications.

Traditional methods of attempting to clean up oil spills include
(1) the use of oil-skimming boats and containment booms; (2)
bombarding the floating oil with chemical dispersants; and (3)
bioremediation, whereby oil-consuming bacteria are dumped on the
oil. However, none of these current methods are considered
satisfactory as significant quantities of the oil spilled cannot
seemingly be recovered or dispersed by any of these methods and
pollution of the environment can continue for many years
afterwards.

Kalocsai found that if a hydrocarbon(s) is contacted with one or
more particular reagents, an absorbent can be produced which
absorbs substantially all of the hydrocarbon(s). The elasticity of
the product which is formed can readily be controlled from elastic,
through viscous liquid to plastic or brittle solid in an efficient
and rapid manner. The original hydrocarbon can be readily recovered
from this product.

By using this method (U.S. Patent 5,468,261), a spilled hydrocarbon
is modified to produce an elastic compound which can be readily
retrieved from a body of water by towing, pushing or skimming the
elastic material from the surface of the water or by using spiked
rollers connected between two vessels which, on rotation, can roll
up the elastic material.

The method can be used to treat only the perimeter of an oil spill
to produce a containment barrier for the remaining, untreated
hydrocarbon,  eliminating the need for artificial booms and
barriers. A system using this method can be carried on vessels or
housed on site to prevent serious oil or similar spillage or leaks
and to be used in the neutralizing and clean-up or salvage of
hydrocarbon leaks or spills.

The hydrocarbon may be a solid, liquid or a gas dissolved or
trapped in a suitable medium. The hydrocarbon may be soluble or
insoluble in water, with best results obtained for hydrocarbons
which are insoluble in water. Preferred hydrocarbons include
ethers; petroleum based liquids including kerosene, petroleum,
crude oil; aromatic compounds, for example, toluene; ketones such
as methyl iso-butyl ketone; natural and refined animal, mineral and
vegetable oils, for example, sunflower oil. Preferably, the first
reagent to be used should be an organic or inorganic acid, salt or
base which is insoluble in water but soluble in the hydrocarbon or
its derivative.

Preferably, the organic acid is a fatty acid (stearic, oleic,
palmitic and levulinic acids, etc.). The preferred choice for the
second reagent depends on the end product required. An alkali
(ammonia, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or bicarbonate or
organic alkaline reagents) should be used for a granular product.
A solution of an elastomer or a latex should be used for a semi-
elastic product, and for a more elastic product a solution of an
elastomer or a latex is followed by the addition of an aqueous
acetate solution should be used. Any organic or metal acetate can
be used, such as ammonium acetate and zinc acetate.

This method for the reversible transformation of hydrocarbons can
also be applied for a wide range of purposes which include
manufacturing solid or viscous liquid compounds for plastics
production, storing and/or transporting volatile, unstable,
environmentally sensitive or toxic hydrocarbons, effectively
absorbing liquid hydrocarbon compounds, and sealing leaking or
damaged containers of liquid hydrocarbon compounds.

It might also convert volatile liquid hydrocarbons to less
volatile, more manageable compounds or be used to quell oil well
fires by converting the oil to a candle-like consistency which
burns at a much lower temperature than the untreated oil and which
is thus much easier to extinguish.

Persian Gulf:
Where's the Oil?

During the war with Iran, millions of gallons of oil spilled on
land and at sea. Following the war, scientists surveyed the Persian
Gulf to track the impact of the massive oil spill. Researchers have
found that both land and sea are recovering through the help of
naturally occurring microbes.

Oil pollution along some shores has rapidly disappeared while
simultaneously microbial mats, thick layers of microbes, were
growing on top of the oil. To understand how the microbial mats
were absorbing and breaking down the oil, the Dept. of Defense is
funding a study of the microbial mats at Northwestern University
(Evanston, IL).

"All we know at this point is that sunlight seems to enhance the
activity of the mats in breaking down the oil," reports David A.
Stahl, associate professor of civil engineering (McCormick School
of Engineering and Applied Science, Northwestern Univ., Evanston,
IL; Tel: 708/-491-4997). "It may be that the microbes that use
photosynthesis are doing the job, or it may be that their
byproducts are being used by another microbe in the mat community,
making it possible for them to do the job," he said.

Stahl receives new microbial mats every few months, which he tests
using the latest molecular biology methods. Stahl says that
probably far less than 1% of the microbial world has been
identified, making his research largely that of finding and
characterizing new forms of microbial life.

Samir Radwan of the University of Kuwait (Safat, Kuwait) reports
that wild flowers are growing in the oil soaked desert. While the
shoots of the plant have an oil stained ring at its base, the roots
are oil free and healthy. Radwan believes that the roots
"recruited" oil degrading microbes naturally found in the soil.
Radwan and his team cultured bacteria and fungi found in the oil
sand and found many well known oil degrading microbes consisting of
Arthrobacter bacteria. Just 1 cm away from the roots was a
completely different community of oil degrading bacteria and fungi.


Laboratory experiments replicated what was observed in the desert.
Radwan believes that rich nutrients such as sugars, available
oxygen, amino acids and vitamins attract petroleum-degrading
microbes.

The researchers recommend that suitable plants be densely
cultivated in polluted desert areas for bioremediation. This
approach may also be applicable in polluted areas in other parts of
the world.

Non-Cryogenic N2
Production Units

Generon Systems Inc. (400 W. Sam Houston Pkwy. South, Houston, TX
77042; Tel: 713/978-3100, Fax: 713/978-3185) provides on site
nitrogen generation for the oil and gas industry. Over 200 oil and
gas wells have been drilled over the last two years using Generon's
GenisisTM nitrogen production units (NPUs). These units work with
existing oil field air compression equipment and can provide from
500-3,000 standard cubic feet per minute of gaseous nitrogen in
purities from 90-99.5% oxygen free.

"Generon also sells smaller NPU systems and we have had several
requests for these systems in Texas to evaluate their use for
nitrogen flooding for enhanced oil recovery," John Koenst, product
manager for Generon, told EERN.

The Generon membrane module contains polymer hollow fiber membranes
which separate gas components of the compressed air stream. Each
membrane fiber is about the size of a human hair with a round bore
through the center. Dry, clean, compressed air passes through the
fiber bundle. It is the varying rates of permeation of nitrogen and
oxygen molecules that form the basis of Generon membrane separation
technology. "Fast" gases like oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water
vapor diffuse through the membrane walls more quickly than
nitrogen, which is concentrated inside the fibers and delivered as
the product gas. The nitrogen product exits the end of each module
and is collected at the outlet manifold for delivery.

Nitrogen from a GENISYS NPU, used with traditional air drilling
equipment, can provide lower drilling costs, reduce the use of
drill mud and mud chemicals, and lessen the surface damage and
environmental impact often associated with other drilling methods.
Similar to air drilling operations, GENISYS systems deliver an
extremely low density drilling "fluid" that can significantly
reduce drilling time because of improved rates of penetration. The
inert, non-reactive nature of gaseous nitrogen is such that it will
not support combustion. Because of this, any risk of down hole
fires, explosions and associated tool damage are virtually
eliminated when using GENISYS NPUs. GENISYS systems are self
contained, incorporating the Generon nitrogen producing, hollow
fiber membrane modules and systems.

A benefit of GENISYS Nitrogen Production Units (NPUs) is that they
will reduce the risk of burnoffs commonly encountered when drilling
with plain compressed air. As little as 5% probability of a burnoff
is high enough to justify the use of a GENISYS NPU. The cost of a
GENISYS NPU in a typical West Texas area drilling location adds
about $0.88 per drilled foot. This is in contrast to the $2.00 per
foot added for extra water, chemicals, bit wear and the unknown
cost of a burnoff due to mud rings.

Coiled tubing operations with nitrogen from Generon's GENISYS
product line may reduce well costs and maximize recovery, all at
once. Oil and gas well completions and workovers with coiled tubing
are a proven method of reducing total well costs and maximizing
recovery from the reservoir. High pressure GENISYS nitrogen is
introduced continuously to the tubing instead of more costly,
delivered liquid nitrogen.

Experience with GENISYS NPUs has shown that using nitrogen in place
of misted, compressed air is a safer and more economical method of
drilling. Drilling with mist is slower than drilling with nitrogen
and 30% more compressed air is required for the "misting up." This
increased capacity results in the need for additional or larger air
compressors to do the job, adding costs to the drilling operation.
Using nitrogen from Genisys will result in as much as a 50% cost
savings on most wells.

At the close of 1995, Dow Chemical announced that it would sell its
Generon subsidiary to MG Industries Inc.  MG, part of the Hoechst
Group of companies, is a mid-sized industrial gas firm.

WAG Project Success
in Salt Creek Field

At the recently held Permian Basin CO2 Conference (December 4-5,
1995) in Midland TX, Abel Salazar of Mobil Oil discussed the case
history of the Salt Creek water-alternating-gas (WAG) project and
shared the key lessons learned from the project.  "The Salt Creek
Field phase 1 area has been a very successful WAG using CO2," said
Salazar. "The WAG project began two years and one month ago and
more than 50% of the current oil production of 27,000 bbls/day are
attributed to CO2 injection."

The Salt Creek Field covers 12,000 acres and is located in Kent
Co., TX, approximately 90 NE of Midland, TX. The field contains 178
active producers, 57 WAG or CO2 injectors and 78 water injectors.
When the project started, 18,500 bbls/day were produced. Less than
one month later, the field began to respond and one year later the
production peaked at 30,000 bbls/day. A total of 7.2 billion bbls
of oil have been produced over the two years of CO2 flooding as
part of the WAG treatment.

"Without CO2 injection, many of these wells would have been
uneconomical," said Salazar. "The biggest challenge at Salt Creek
Field is managing the producing gas oil ratio, and WAG is the
cheapest and quickest method to do this." He said that Mobil was
very happy with the WAG results and that Mobil will expand into the
phase 2 area as of March 1996 and will continue expansion into the
phase 3 area through the year 2001.

"Salt Creek Field is very dynamic and needs continuous
surveillance," Salazar explained. "The key to the success of the
CO2 injection is management. A detailed pattern analysis is
necessary, as are team work and having good communication with
field personnel."

Salazar offered some specific guidelines based on Mobil's
experience with the field. He counseled to use maximum available
carbon dioxide supply rate as long as possible from pipeline and
gas plant capacities and vary WAG ratios on a pattern by pattern
basis. WAG/breakthrough problems can be identified by watching cash
flow per producing well and not allowing the cash flow to go
negative. Apply same waterflood workover procedures during carbon
dioxide flood. Exception is for high GOR wells which require
increased mud costs. Supplement fuel may be necessary to insure
proper carbon dioxide flare operation.

Another guide is that all surface systems should be planned for
flexibility.
Remember that the vendor/engineering contractor community knows
very little about metering carbon dioxide streams at either high or
low pressures.

DOE Program Aids
Smaller Producers

Independent producers today account for nearly 40% of the nation's
domestic oil supply, but virtually none of these companies have the
technical capability or resources to try untried or unfamiliar
technological approaches that potentially could improve their
economic viability. As a result, with oil prices remaining
relatively low, many of these companies are on the verge of
abandoning much of the nation's remaining oil resource. To help
meet this need, the Dept. of Energy (DOE) (1000 Independence Ave.
SW, Washington, DC 20585; Tel: 202/586-5000) is assisting several
of the nation's smallest independent oil producers in applying
innovative technologies that could help maintain the viability of
an increasingly important segment of the U.S. petroleum industry.

DOE, working through its National Institute for Petroleum and
Energy Research (NIPER, 220 N. Virginia, Bartlesville, OK 74003;
Tel: 918/336-2400, Fax: 918/337-4339) is providing nearly $400,000
in technical assistance contracts to eight independent producers.
The producers and their project partners provide more than $500,000
in private sector cost-sharing and in-kind contributions. By
providing a small amount of federal cost-sharing, $50,000 or less
per project, the DOE is encouraging the producers to experiment
with the higher-risk approaches that could mean the difference
between maintaining production from an oil field or shutting it in.
The program is directed at companies with less than 50 employees or
contractors who have no affiliation with a major oil company.

The eight companies, and others added to the program in the future,
will be the focus of an extensive technology transfer effort to be
conducted by the DOE and BDM-Oklahoma, the operator of NIPER.
Through workshops, technical reports, and the use of expanding DOE
and industry electronic networks to the petroleum industry,
techniques and results from the trial projects will be disseminated
to other small producers.

This effort differs from the larger Reservoir Class Field
Demonstration Program that DOE initiated in 1992.  The Reservoir
Class program, now underway in 14 States, involves full-scale field
tests that, in most cases, are demonstrating multiple techniques
for maintaining production from fields threatened by near-term
abandonment.  The smaller effort is pinpointing specific production
problems and attempting to demonstrate lower-cost remedies, often
focusing on an individual well or group of wells.

The DOE technical assistance program remains open for independent
producers to submit proposals.  Since BDM-Oklahoma announced the
start of the small producer program last March, independent oil
field operators have submitted 37 proposals.  Those not selected
remain eligible for further consideration, and additional proposals
are being accepted.  DOE has just over $240,000 in remaining funds
set aside for this effort, and additional project selections are
expected approximately every three months through next May. :

TRRC Amends Its
Inactive Well Rule

Texas Railroad Commissioners (TRRC, Box 12967 Austin, TX 78711-
2967; Tel: 512/463-7288) have approved a rule change designed to
help more inactive oil and gas wells qualify for a state severance
tax exemption approved by the legislature. Chairman Carole Keeton
Rylander and Commissioners Barry Williamson and Charles R. Matthews
expanded provisions of the current program which encourages
operators to bring wells that have been inactive for at least three
years back on production, thereby qualifying them for up to a 10-
year exemption from state severance tax on the oil or gas they
produce.

Under the rule change, the Texas Railroad Commission (TRRC) will be
able to certify an eligible well as a "three year inactive well"
without it having to be brought back into production at the time of
certification. This will give the operator of a certified well the
leeway of bringing it back on tax-exempt production anytime during
the 10 years following the certification date. The new procedure
requires the operator of a certified well to file a test report
showing productive capability with the Commission before applying
to the state comptroller for the tax incentive.

"Texas is a true leader in the area of tax incentive development
and implementation," Commissioner Williamson said. "This particular
rule change will extend the life of thousands of Texas wells,
creating jobs and tax revenue and developing natural resources that
would otherwise be lost to the state."

The Three Year Inactive Well Incentive program has been an
unqualified success. Since its beginning in 1993, almost 5,500 oil
and gas wells, capable of producing 16.4 million barrels of oil and
153.8 billion cubic feet of gas a year, have been certified. The
Commission estimates the value of that production at $584 million
and the positive impact on the Texas economy at $1.7 billion.

Differing Views
on Compliance

Petroleum producers and refiners are vitally interested in the
quality of water that they can legally discharge and equally
interested in the quality of water available for their use.  An old
saying is "Don't inject any water into your well that you wouldn't
drink." Injected minerals and microbes can have disastrous effects.


The EPA's goal of maintaining and protecting surface water quality
has led the EPA to set some very low limits for a variety of
pollutants. The demanding EPA requirements for testing and
reporting have prompted some contrasting reactions.

While Anna Rule (Hampton Roads Sanitation District, Virginia Beach,
VA; Tel: 804/874-1287) exposes the impracticalities and
inadequacies of compliance testing, Darrell R. Wilder
(Environmental Services Lab, Eastman Chemical Co., Kingsport, TN
37662-5054) sees compliance testing and waste minimization as
opportunities for self-directed efforts to eliminate sources of
pollution and reduce the burden of testing.

Writing in Water Environment & Technology [7-11, 31-34, 1995] Rule
points out that the minimum concentration at which a chemical's
presence can be determined by a specific method is an exceedingly
minute but imprecise quantity which has nevertheless become a
regulatory goal and performance standard. A method detection limit
(MDL) is the minimum concentration of a substance which can be
identified, measured, and reported with 99% confidence that its
concentration is greater than zero. The EPA bases MDL on the
standard deviation of a set of replicate determinations.

The EPA has set water quality criteria for some substances at or
below MDLs without considering the limits of analytical technology.
Compliance with permit limits set below MDLs or at zero is
problematic because measurement errors, variability, and
uncertainty. Measurements at ultradilute levels are consequently
anything but absolutely true and exact determinations.

Rule indicates the flaws in deriving a confidence interval from a
set of determinations and suggests that prediction intervals or
tolerance intervals are more appropriate for estimating the range
of future multiple measurements and the probability that a given
percentage of them attain a given MDL. Rule points out that it
introduces a bias to treat results at or below an MDL as zero or
nondetectable while accepting higher values as true and accurate.

"All measurements, at any level, include defined and unavoidable
imprecision. Analytical and sample variance, or relative standard
deviation of measurements (RSD) is not constant throughout the
concentration range but gradually increases as the results approach
the lower or upper end of the analytical range. . . . The practice
of eliminating low-level data by reporting 'less than' or 'zero' is
called left-censoring and is regarded as an unnecessary loss of
valuable information." While it is statistically valid to use low-
end data, this approach often conflicts with setting regulatory
limits.

Rule favors the calibration curve method as an alternative for
estimating measurement detection limits. This method finds
tolerance intervals for assessing future performance and uses them
to define uncertainty bands on the calibration curve. The analyst
may then compute and define minimum concentrations that have an
acceptable level of confidence with a predetermined RSD. The
calibration curve method is the basis of a proposal presented to
EPA by a Detection/Quantitation Workgroup representing the
regulated community. Other concepts of MDL may be appropriate, but
the problem is the validity of low-end results. Carefully developed
and documented protocols should allow a more effective validation
and define more appropriate uses although at a higher cost.

Working the higher end of compliance testing, Wilder accepts
compliance testing as a fact of life for environmental discharges
in the chemical industry. Now that the NPDES program has entered a
phase of diminishing returns, the EPA is encouraging a "front end"
approach to pollution control that encourages proactive waste
minimization and pollution prevention.

Government initiatives and voluntary programs have created
financial incentives for chemical companies to go beyond routine
compliance by developing environmental strategies that reflect
environmental responsibility. Writing in Analytical Chemistry [25-
2, 77-89, 1995] Wilder presents a review of some new measurement
technologies for preventing pollution and cutting waste.

Wilder considers technologies for measurement of wasteload
concentrations, flow measurements, monitoring specific waste
components, monitoring networks, process control of activated
sludge treatment systems, and measurement of air emissions. Wilder
believes that internal and self-directed efforts by chemical
companies in all these areas give analysts scope for ingenuity and
creativity in identifying and eliminating sources of toxic
contaminants. Successful results could reduce the burden of
compliance testing.

Improved Gels for
Oil Field Brines

Gelled or crosslinked water-soluble polymers are used in enhanced
oil recovery and other oil field operations to change formation
permeability, enhancing the effectiveness of water flooding
operations. Generally, polymers along with an appropriate
crosslinking system are injected in an aqueous solution into the
formation and permeate into and gel in the regions of highest water
permeability. By using a produced brine as the aqueous solution
carrier for the polymers, operators can avoid the environmental
concerns as well as cost for disposing of a produced brine. It also
saves the cost associated with acquiring and pre-treating fresh
water for use as the aqueous solution.

Most produced brines are hard brines, defined as having a salinity
of greater than 2% total dissolved solids, basically inorganic
salts. Chromium(III) carboxylates such as chromium acetate are the
only known crosslinkers which can be used to produce stable gels in
produced brines for near-wellbore treatment. Although a
chromium(III) salt is not as toxic as a chromium(VI) salt, it is
still not desirable in the environment. Its use may require
additional costs to assure the integrity of the injection wells to
avoid contamination of ground water sources.

Ahmad Moradi-Araghi of Phillips Petroleum Co. (16 Phillips Bldg.,
Bartlesville, OK 74004; Tel: 918/661-6600) has found a more
environmentally suitable gelling composition that can form stable
gels in produced brines. It has the benefit that the gelling
composition does not crosslink too fast (i.e., gel times longer
than 2 hours) so that individual components of the composition can
be injected simultaneously into the wells. The composition consists
of a produced brine; a water-soluble polymer (i.e.,
polyacrylamide), a crosslinker (i.e., a complexed zirconium
compound), and optionally a complexing ligand (i.e., lactic acid).
The composition can be used for either in depth treatment of an oil
field or near-wellbore treatment such as water shutoff, gas
shutoff, and zone abandonment.

More specific information is included in U.S. Patent 5,478,802. The
patent says that it is desirable to delay the rate of gelation so
that the components of the composition can be injected at the same
time without plugging up the injection or producing wells.  A
produced brine having a salinity of from 4-25% generally produces
better results.

Suitable polymers are those which are capable of gelling in the
presence of polyvalent metal ion crosslinking agents. Polymers
capable of gelling in the presence of crosslinking agents within a
gelation pH range, include biopolysaccharides, cellulose ethers,
and acrylamide-based polymers. The preferred biopolysaccharides are
polysaccharide B-1459 and xanthan gums which are biopolysaccharides
produced by the action of Xanthomonas campestris bacteria.
Preferred cellulose ethers include carboxymethylhydroxyethyl
cellulose (CMHEC) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Preferred
polymers which contain acrylamide as well as 0.5-5 mole % of
pendant carboxylate (acrylate) groups are the partially hydrolyzed
polyacrylamides possessing pendant carboxylate groups through which
crosslinking can take place.

The crosslinker is a metal compound selected from the group
consisting of a complexed zirconium compound, a complexed titanium
compound, and mixtures of these. These compounds are commercially
available.

A suitable complexing ligand to retard the rate of gelation may be
chosen from the group consisting of lactic acid, neutralized lactic
acid, citric acid, ammonium, potassium or sodium citrate, isocitric
acid, ammonium, potassium or sodium isocitrate, malic acid,
ammonium, potassium or sodium malate, tartaric acid, ammonium,
potassium or sodium tartrate, triethanolamine, malonic acid,
ammonium, potassium or sodium malonate, and mixtures of these. Due
to their ready availability and low cost, the presently preferred
complexing ligands are triethanolamine, citric acid, lactic acid,
tartaric acid and salts of these.

The composition of the invention can be prepared by mixing the
individual components together employing conventionally well-known
mixing means. The order of adding individual components does not
change the characteristics of the composition.

The concentration of crosslinker in the composition depends largely
on the concentration of polymer in the composition. Lower
concentrations of polymer require lower concentrations of
crosslinker. Further, it has been found that for a given
concentration of polymer, increasing the concentration of
crosslinker generally substantially increases the rate of gelation.
The concentration of crosslinker in the injected slug varies
generally over the broad range of 25-5,000 ppm, preferably over the
range of 100-2,000 ppm based on Zr or Ti concentration.

The concentration of the complexing ligand in the composition also
depends on the concentrations of the water-soluble polymer in the
composition and on the desired rate of gelation. Generally, the
faster the gelation rate, the lower concentration of the complexing
ligand is required. Generally, the concentration of the complexing
ligand varies broadly in the range of about 25-5,000 ppm,
preferably in the range of about 50-3,000 ppm, and most preferably
in the range of 100-2,000 ppm.

PDVSA Is Now a
Mature Corporation

Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA, Apartado 169, Caracas 1010-A,
Venezuela) recently celebrated its 20th anniversary. PDVSA has
moved from its initial role of being "a simple coordinator" of 14
subsidiaries to "a mature and powerful corporation, with clarity of
objectives, and holding a first class national and international
position," said PDVSA president Luis Giusti. "Today, PDVSA is a
strong and solvent corporation holding an excellent position on the
main world markets, with a modern production and refining
infrastructure and a first class technical team."

PDVSA has confirmed that the Orinoco Oil Belt contains reserves of
heavy and extra heavy crudes and bitumens estimated at
approximately 1.2 trillion barrels, of which some 270 billion
barrels are recoverable with the use of today's technology. Those
massive reserves of hard to market heavy crudes and bitumens in the
Belt have posed a major challenge for PDVSA. The corporation has
approached development in two ways: negotiating strategic
associations with foreign oil companies to exploit and upgrade the
recoverable resources and embarking on an ambitious project
converting bitumen into Orimulsion, a unique boiler fuel used in
plants that generate electricity.

Maraven, one of the PDVSA Group has worked out two major
development projects in partnership with several international
companies. Along with Conoco Inc. (P.O. Box 1267, Ponca City, OK
74602-1267; Tel: 405/767-3456), Maraven will produce approximately
120,000 barrels per day of extra-heavy crude from the Belt.

That crude will be upgraded in Venezuela to a lighter synthetic
crude using Conoco's delayed coking technology. A similar
production and upgrading project involving Maraven, Total (Cedex
47, 92069 Paris la Defense, Paris, France), Itochu (1-3 Kita-
Kyutaromachi, Osaka OSK0541, Japan), and Marubeni Corp. (5-7
Honmachi, 2-Chome, Osaka OSK0541, Japan) are also ready to go
onstream.

Letters of intent already have been signed for a third development
project in the belt that will bring Corpoven, a member of the PDVSA
group, and ARCO International Oil and Gas Co. in a strategic
association to produce some 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) of medium
grade crudes, and a fourth project involving a partnership between
Lagoven, a member of the PDVSA Group, and Mobil Oil Corp. (3225
Gallows Rd., Fairfax, VA 22037; Tel: 703/846-3000) to produce
100,000 bpd from the eastern region of the Belt.

The corporation hopes those four projects will generate a combined
output of between 400,000-500,000 bpd of synthetic crude by the
turn of the century. Those joint venture deals follow a series of
operating agreements between PDVSA subsidiaries and several private
foreign companies for the reactivation of marginal or inactive oil
fields which now are producing an additional 58,00 bpd of crudes.
PDVSA expects to exceed 430,000 bpd by the year 2000.

PDVSA subsidiaries have made a series of operating agreements with
private foreign companies for the reactivation of marginal or
inactive oil fields which are now producing an additional 58,000
barrels per day of crudes. That figure is expected to exceed
430,000 bpd by the turn of the century.

PDVSA has begun an ambitious plan to manufacture and export
Orimulsion. Orimulsion exports have grown from about 1.7 million
metric tons in 1992 to approximately 2.43 million metric tons in
1994. The plan projects Orimulsion exports at approximately 20
million metric tons by the year 2000.  Bitumenes Orinoco, S.A.
(BITOR), the subsidiary of PDVSA responsible for the manufacture,
transport and marketing of Orimulsion, has already signed a supply
contract agreement with Canada's New Brunswick Power, which adapted
its Dalhousie power plant to burn Orimulsion fuel, and with Florida
Power & Light which will use Orimulsion in its Manatee, FL plant.

BITOR is negotiating with electric facilities in Europe and Asia.
BITOR has shipped significant test volumes of Orimulsion to
potential clients in Portugal, Italy and Germany. A supply contract
has been signed with SK-Power of Denmark for the purchase of up to
1.5 million metric tons a year of the product, for two years, which
began in 1995.

Suncor Scales
Up in Australia

In Australia, Suncor Inc. (P.O. Box 38, 112 4th Ave. SW, Calgary,
Albert, Canada; Tel: 403/269-8100) will scale up and apply Taciuk
processor technology. Taciuk processor technology was originally
developed by the Alberta Oil Sands Technology Research Authority
(AOSTRA), the functions of which are now part of the Alberta Dept.
of Energy (5th Floor, 801 6th Ave. SW, Calgary, Alberta T2P 3W2,
Canada; Tel: 403/297-3380). The Taciuk processor combines the
extraction, upgrading and energy-generating processes of
traditional oil sands/shales projects and requires less capital and
equipment.

"Suncor was the first in the world to pioneer the commercial
development of the oil sands," said Suncor president and CEO Rick
George. "We are uniquely positioned to apply our expertise in oil
sands development in other parts of the world."

Suncor has reached an agreement with two Australian companies,
Southern Pacific Petroleum NL (Lufthansa House, 143 MacQuarie St.,
Sidney, NSW 2000, Australia) and Central Pacific Minerals NL
(McFarlane House, 127 George St., Brisbane, QLD 4000, Australia),
to begin development work to demonstrate the commercial viability
of producing oil from Australian oil shale using the Taciuk
process.

Suncor will invest $7 million to conduct preliminary engineering
and complete commercial negotiations to build a shale oil plant in
Gladstone, a port city on the east coast in Queensland, Australia.
The agreement covers the development of the Stuart oil shale
deposit which is estimated to contain the equivalent of three
billion barrels of shale oil.

Development work is expected to take six to nine months to
complete. After that the partners will decide whether to proceed
with the 4,500 barrel a day plant. The project is estimated to cost
about $200 million, of which Suncor would contribute up to an
additional $65 million over the next two years. At that point,
Suncor would earn a 50% interest in the project.

If the project is successful, Suncor and its partners have plans to
develop a second and third stage, which could ultimately result in
an 85,000 barrel a day commercial operation over a 10 year period.
In addition, Suncor has the right to acquire an option for $3.5
million to purchase a 22.4% interest in Southern Pacific Petroleum
and Central Pacific Minerals. This option can be exercised any time
up to six months after the shale oil plant begins operations.

George said the project fits strategically with Suncor's growth
plans. "Our core businesses continue as the foundation of our
growth," said George. "To create additional shareholder value, we
are pushing the boundaries of our existing businesses and looking
for new yet related energy opportunities." Suncor plans to
diversify in stages through a series of modest investments.

Suncor has plans to spend more than $1 billion over five years to
increase production at its Oil Sands and Resources groups. Suncor
plans to invest approximately $475 million on capital and
exploration programs in 1996, up about 20% from 1995. Of the $475
million, approximately $260 million will be directed to the oil
sands, $160 million will go to the conventional oil and gas
division and $55 million will be spent at Sunoco, Suncor's refining
and marketing group.

"The increased spending supports our plans to expand our
conventional exploration and production and oil sands operations,"
said Rick George, Suncor president and CEO. The Oil Sands Group
capital program includes projects to expand production, plan a new
mine site, reduce sulfur dioxide emissions and make other
environmental and sustaining capital investments.

At Resources Group, capital will be spent on increasing reserves
and production through exploration, development and acquisitions.
Suncor also plans to spend approximately $17 million on a project
to test a new technology at its Burnt Lake heavy oil property. In
its downstream operations, Suncor will increase spending to
approximately $55 million to improve environmental, energy and
operating efficiency at its refining and Sunoco retail operations.

ChevronMoves
Toward Its Goals

Chevron Corp. (P.O. Box 7753, San Francisco, CA 94120-7753; Tel:
415/894-4440) chairman Ken Derr told a meeting of financial
analysts that Chevron has made great strides in the second half of
1995 toward improving shareholder value and reducing the company's
already competitive cost structure. He noted that Chevron's stock
hit an all-time high during December 1995 and that Chevron has had
its most productive year of oil discoveries in 15 years, based on
the projected reserves from a number of key wells.

One promising area is a new discovery in the Congo, Moho Marine 1,
which is one of Chevron's largest discoveries in West Africa. The
field appears to be geologically similar to nearby N'Kossa. The
N'Kossa field is on track to begin production in mid-1996, with
peak production of 110,000 barrels per day (bpd) expected in late
1997. Chevron's share is 30%.

Several promising areas are in Northwest Australia, where Chevron
and partners have made major discoveries and added new production.
Last month, the Wanaea and Cossack fields began production and are
scheduled to reach design capacity of 115,000 bpd in the first
quarter. Huge gas discoveries at Chrysaor and Perseus were also
announced in the past year.

"One of Chevron's enduring strengths is our ability to find oil and
gas, and we are completing an exceptionally good year of new
discoveries," Derr said. "In addition to this, we expect to replace
more than 110% of our worldwide proved reserves when final 1995
figures are in."

Also in the exploration and production area, Chevron announced in
December 1995 a major alliance with Maraven of Venezuela to further
develop the huge Boscan oil field and supply heavy crude oil to
U.S. refineries (see article in foreign Industry News, this issue).

Several company businesses in December 1995 have announced
restructuring to reduce costs, improve efficiency and to meet
strategic intents, Derr noted, including:

Chevron Chemical Co., which announced a restructuring along
geographic lines, forming a new International Group as well as a
U.S. chemicals division. The action supports the chemical company's
strategic intent to improve competitive financial performance while
developing attractive opportunities for growth, Derr said. The
former Aromatics and Olefins divisions, both headquartered in
Houston, will be combined to form one U.S. Chemicals Div., to
remain in Houston.

A new international group, eventually to be based in San Ramon, CA,
will help Chevron focus specifically on growth markets in key
regions around the world.  Chevron Chemical's other major division,
the Oronite Additives Div., based in San Ramon, already operates
internationally and is unaffected by the reorganization.

U.S. products marketing announced a consolidation of regional
offices and support functions, reducing costs $8 million per year
and supporting greater customer focus. U.S. refining also has a new
management team charged with achieving incident free operation
while reducing costs. The business activities of Chevron
International Oil Co. are being reorganized, as announced early
this month. As part of the change, the company's international
lubricants business will be consolidated with the U.S. business
into a new Global Lubricants unit.

Another major step was taken by Caltex, Chevron's 50-50 joint
venture with Texaco, which is a major refiner/marketer in Asia.
Caltex recently announced the $2 billion sale of its 50% interest
in a refining company in Japan, where markets are mature, in order
to focus more on growth areas such as China and India. The action
supports the strategy of growing Caltex in attractive markets,
while achieving superior competitive financial performance.

Beta Well to Sell
Kazakstan Interest

The Board of Directors of Beta Well Service Inc. (Calgary, Alberta,
Canada; Tel: 403/290-0660) has approved a conditional agreement in
principle to sell its 50% interest in the Zhetybay-Quest
partnership, two well servicing rigs and related equipment, all of
which are located in Kazakstan, to a large oil and gas company.  It
is proposed that the transaction's effective date and closing date
will be March 31,1996. If the sale is completed, the consideration
would be approximately $12 million in cash 91 days after closing,
and deferred payments totaling $30 million contingent upon
Zhetybay-Quest's profitability.

A company spokesman said that if the transaction can be completed,
it would be a positive development for all interested parties.
"Beta would have the opportunity to realize a significant return on
its Zhetybay-Quest investment.  The financial strength of the
prospective new owner would assure its Kazak partner and the
government of Kazakstan that the Zhetybay field would be developed
on a timely basis."

Chevron, Maraven
Form Major Alliance

Chevron (6001 Bollinger Canyon Rd., San Ramon, CA 94583; Tel:
510/842-1000) and Maraven S.A. (Apartado Postal 829, Caracas,
Venezuela 1010-A;  Tel: 58/2 908 3096) have formed a multi-faceted
alliance which will further the development of the Boscan oil field
in Venezuela and provide for supplies of heavy crude oil to Chevron
in the U.S.

The alliance covers an initial period of 20 years with an optional
10 year extension. Chevron will operate Venezuela's Boscan heavy
oil field, and anticipates a $2 billion investment over a 20-30
year period.  Maraven will become Chevron's joint-venture partner
in a West Coast asphalt business, and will also supply crude for
Chevron's refinery at Pascagoula, MS, and for the company's asphalt
plants at Perth Amboy, NJ, Portland, OR, and Richmond Beach, WA.

For the Boscan Field, Chevron and Maraven have structured an
Operating Service Agreement to assure continued development of the
50-year-old Boscan field, discovered by Chevron in 1946.  "We plan
to increase production from 80,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 115,000
bpd during the next three years," said Richard Matzke, president of
Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc., who signed the agreement.

Independent studies confirm the Boscan field contains 1.6 billion
barrels of proven reserves.  Chevron will be responsible for
operations and production, while Maraven will be responsible for
marketing. Through the new arrangement, Chevron becomes the first
international oil company since 1975 to be responsible for such a
high level of production in Venezuela.  "We're encouraged by
Maraven's demonstration of trust in our technical expertise,"
Matzke said. He noted that the work to be done, albeit challenging,
will result in major economic enhancements for the Venezuelan
economy.

"Boscan crude, with an API gravity of 10 degrees, is an excellent
asphalt feedstock," explained Dave O'Reilly, president of Chevron
U.S.A. (CUSA) Products Co., who signed the downstream agreements.
"This new alliance provides an opportunity for Chevron and Maraven
to collaborate on both upstream and downstream ventures," O'Reilly
said.

Affiliates of Chevron and Maraven will also form a partnership to
acquire and process feedstock into asphalt and other products for
marketing in the Western U.S. The new joint venture, to be named
Chevron Ven Asphalt Alliance, will have a processing and service
agreement with CUSA Products which will retain its West Coast
asphalt refineries and perform supply, processing and marketing
functions on behalf of the joint venture.  "This venture should
increase asphalt production and offer new marketing opportunities,"
said O'Reilly.

Occidental Expands
Ecuador Operations

Occidental Petroleum Corp. (10889 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles, CA
90024-4201; Tel: 213/879-1700) and Canadian Occidental Petroleum
Ltd. have reached an agreement with Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian
state oil company, to increase exploration and development
activities on Block 15 in the prolific Oriente Basin in eastern
Ecuador.

The agreement calls for Occidental as operator to conduct an
exploration program in the 97% of the block that has yet to be
explored.  In exchange, Occidental receives improved contract terms
regarding new discoveries, including a minimum extension of seven
years to develop new discoveries.

Occidental acquired the 494,000-acre block in 1985 under a risk-
service contract with Petroecuador. To date, six fields have been
discovered, and four of those have been developed and are producing
approximately 24,000 barrels of oil per day.  The 20-year
exploitation period under the contract began in 1992. Occidental
has an 85% interest in the block with Canadian Occidental holding
the remaining 15%.

Pennzoil in China
Joint Venture

Pennzoil Products Co. (Pennzoil Place, P.O. Box 2967, Houston, TX
77262-8200; Tel: 713/546-6100) has acquired a 50% equity share in
a new lubricant manufacturing and marketing joint venture between
Pennzoil and Lithcon Petroleum Inc. in Tianjin, China.

William E. Welcher, group VP, products marketing, said that
Pennzoil and Lithcon have purchased land and an existing, new
building in Tianjin which will be utilized for a lubricating oil
blending plant and a sales and marketing office complex. "The
existing facility is strategically located close to one of China's
largest ports in the Tianjin Economic Technological Development
Area," said Welcher.  "It is also located in the Bohai Bay area,
China's second largest economic zone."

Welcher said that owing to Bohai Bay's natural and labor resources,
large market and technology, this area is expected to become the
nucleus of the northeast Asia's economic belt which spans north and
north-east China, South Korea, Mongolia, Siberia and the Far East.
The total lubricants requirement within the five provinces located
around Tianjin together with the municipalities of Beijing and
Tianjin is approximately one-third of China's total lubricant
demand.

Making Well Info
More Accessible

Obtaining data for an oil or gas producing property is a time
consuming and difficult task, limiting the producer's effectiveness
to make sound business and engineering decisions. The data are
located in a variety of places, some of which are inaccessible to
the average user. Independent producers would like more effective
access to this crucial information to expand their business
options. Major oil companies with properties in which production is
no longer justified would like more effective access to facilitate
the sale of any properties that independents might see as viable.
Government agencies would like to see more effective access for the
independents to avoid the abandonment of wells that might be
productive.

Sam Coleman (Tel: 510/422-4323) and Jeff Wagoner (Tel: 510/422-
1374) of Lawrence Livermore National Lab (Univ. of California, P.O.
Box 808, L-156, Livermore, CA 94551) are developing a database of
existing oil field data for California and Texas. These states,
like many other states, provide public access to oil and gas
production data, and other types of well information. Much of the
data is centrally located. However, the data are in a format that
is difficult to search and retrieve with access mechanisms which
are ineffective, tedious, and expensive to maintain.

The Oil and Gas Data Infrastructure Project is designing,
implementing, and integrating inexpensive, standards-based,
mechanisms for online access to data from Texas, California, and
other states. The project will combine database, Internet, and
World Wide Web technology to make existing Oil and Gas data readily
available for online analysis.

Cost-effective access will be available through the existing
Internet infrastructure using de facto Internet tools. Data will be
displayed on the user's personal computer or downloaded for
analysis by a variety of existing commercial applications. The
project will deliver a demonstration system that will serve as a
prototype for use by government agencies and private corporations.
It is anticipated that cost effective analysis of data will
facilitate the transfer of petroleum leases to independent
producers, slow the abandonment of wells, enhance the production of
existing fields, and increase the efficiency of drilling
activities.

The California Div. of Oil and Gas and Geothermal Resources and the
Texas Railroad Commission maintain a great deal of information on
each well. This includes applications to do work, permits issued,
drilling and exploration histories and maps.

The information has been available to the public and industry, but
interested parties must come to the regional offices, identify and
locate information they need, and request or create hard copies of
any desired information. Both California and Texas government
agencies are interested in providing electronic systems for well
records to improve public access and reduce operating expenses.

The Dept. of Energys (DOE, 1000 Independence Ave. SW, Washington,
DC 20585; Tel: 202/586-5000) Advanced Computational Technology
Initiative is supporting software development at the national
laboratories and the analysis of Texas and California data through
the university partners.

Short Radius-Curved
Borehole Apparatus

W. James Hughes, James W. McCabe, and Owen L. Marks, Jr. of
Maverick Tool Co. (211 Beeline Dr., Bensenville, IL 60106. Tel:
708/860-5632) have developed a new method and apparatus to drill a
short radius curved boreholes portion of a horizontal or
directional well. This technique can achieve a radius of curvature
of less than 20 ft.

A tight radius of curvature is rotary drilled by use of flexible
composite drilling pipe or other common flexible pipe which
terminate within an eccentric collar on the final drill string
section. The eccentric collar is equipped with a retractable and
grooved compression pad which expands outwardly to hold the
eccentric collar (which is also grooved on its opposite side)
against the side of the well bore to prevent the eccentric collar
from rotating during the rotary drilling process. The final drill
string section connects to a lower drill bit collar and rotary
drill bit through a driving ball and socket connection. The
eccentric collar on the final drill string section that engages the
well bore forces the deflection of the drill bit about the ball and
socket connection and holds this orientation as the rotating drill
proceeds forward.

The short radius required for lateral or horizontal drilling has
been a difficult drilling process to control. In the past, a
whipstock was employed to drill short radius horizontal holes below
a vertical cased well bore. This technique limits the smallest
curvature radius for surface drilling to 19 feet which is 3 of
deflection per foot over 30 ft. of linear drilling to produce a
horizontal drainhole at depths greater than 2,000 ft.

Although others have achieved some degree of success in drilling a
tight radius or curvature, Maverick's new patented (U.S. 5,467,834)
apparatus addresses the problems of the inconsistent radius of
curvature, the weakness of ball/pin flexible joint which could fail
under normal operating conditions, and the difficulty in
maintaining the desired orientation of deflection. It overcomes the
inability to accurately determine the direction and correct for
errors and the multiple problems caused by constant engagement of
spring-loaded blades ranging from misorientation to sticking in the
hole.

Energy BioSystems
Better Biocatalyst

Energy BioSystems Corp. (4200 Research Forest Dr., The Woodlands,
TX 77381; Tel: 713/364-6100, Fax: 713/364-6110) has made a major
advance in the performance of the biocatalyst which drives the
company's proprietary biocatalytic desulfurization (BDS) system.
Application of recent discoveries has lead to a six- to eightfold
increase in the specific activity of intermediate reactions
critical to BDS economics.

"In the last few months we have applied the discoveries reported in
September," said Dr. Daniel J. Monticello, VP of R&D at Energy
Biosystems. "The resulting improvement exceeds our expectation of
a three- to fivefold increase. We are now significantly closer to
the performance level needed for commercialization of BDS, but
additional development is required on a dinal reaction to produce
the prototype biocatalyst necessary for pilot plant demonstration
runs," he continued. Further improvements are expected in early
1996 which should lead to the biocatalyst performance required for
commercial demonstration of BDS technology.

Energy BioSystems announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office has issued two new process patents to the company. "We
continue to improve the process design of BDS as well as the
biocatalyst," commented Dr. Monticello, "and we continue to pursue
strong patent protection for these improvements in order to enhance
our competitive position as we move toward the commercialization of
BDS."

The first patent (U.S. 5,472,875) claims a new reactor design
involving the introduction of air or oxygen-enriched gas into the
oil prior to treatment with the biocatalyst. The second patent
(U.S. 5,468,626) claims a method by which a biosorption agent
preferentially adsorbs sulfur-containing compounds from petroleum.
Such a process design could reduce the size of the bioreactor by
concentrating on those compounds requiring desulfurization, thus
reducing capital equipment cost.

Exxon Upgrades
Steam Cracker Tars

Researchers at Exxon Corp. (1251 Avenue of the Americas, New York,
NY 10020) have discovered a process for the production of gaseous
mono- and di-olefins, particularly ethylene, propylene and
butadiene. The advantage of the process is that it prevents or
mitigates reactions of asphaltene precursors to form asphaltenes.

The patented process (U.S. 5,443,715) involves first introducing a
hydrocarbon feedstock stream into a high temperature thermal
cracking zone to produce a high temperature cracked product stream.
The cracked product stream is quenched to stop the cracking
reactions. At least one HDD (hydrogen donor diluent) such as
hydrotreated steam cracked tar oils is injected into the cracked
product stream at or downstream of the point at which the reaction
is quenched, so as to prevent thermal degradation reactions of the
steam cracked liquids.

Normally gaseous olefins are recovered from the cracked product
stream, and a liquid product stream is recovered which contains a
diminished asphaltene content. In this manner, the process upgrades
the tars that are formed during the production of gaseous olefins.
The inventors are Dane C. Grenoble, Roy T. Halle, Martin L.
Gorbaty, and Harold W. Helmke.

Solvent, Steam
Soak Promising

Researchers at Maraven (Apdo. 829, Caracas 1010-A, Venezuela) have
evaluated using various additives to enhance oil recovery and
improve the economics of steam soak projects. Initial results are
encouraging. Solvent injection with steam resulted in initial oil
rates 50% higher than steam alone. The steam soak process can be
efficient and economical, but in western Venezuela its
effectiveness is linked to formation compaction, the main
production mechanism. To optimize the effects of the steam soak
process, various additives were tested to improve the cycle
behavior.

The additives used in the tests included surfactants to increase
vertical steam distribution and improve the flow of the heated oil,
solvents to increase oil mobility and steam stimulation followed by
a slug of natural gas to increase the heated area and reactivate
the solution gas drive mechanism.

It was concluded that steam soak with solvent coinjection was the
most feasible approach, since solvent additives are abundant and
cost less than the other additives used in this study. Further
observation and evaluation of this approach was recommended. The
results were first presented at the Unitar International Conference
on Heavy Crude and Tar Sands held in Houston, TX.

SUPERPHENIX TO SHUT DOWN IN EARLY 1997 FOR REFURBISHMENT

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The Superphenix prototype nuclear plant will be shut down for five months
in early 1997 for modifications to its fast breeder reactor, which will
henceforth be used for research, local authorities announced on October
11. The modifications, announced during an information meeting with the
officials, will mainly involve the replacement of some subassemblies in
the reactor's core and the installation of experimental sub-assemblies
"with a higher plutonium content or containing radioactive waste with a
long half-life, such as neptunium". The Superphenix plant, located at
Creys-Malville, in France's Rhone-Alpes region, has encountered many
problems since it was opened in 1986 and has actually operated very little
since that date. Back on line in August 1994, the plant is now running at
60% capacity. Its management expects authorisation for an increase to 90%
shortly, but will not ask permission to turn Superphenix up to 100% power,
given the short time remaining before the shutdown.

In its annual report, the French Court of Auditors has estimated the total
cost of Superphenix at 60 billion French Francs. A spokesman for the plant
said that this calculation was based on a shutdown in 2000, while the
programme provided for operation until 2015. The representative also
indicated that the 51% of the fast breeder reactor's costs were being
assumed by EDF and 49% by Italy and a consortium of several other
countries. He said that the reactor could make a "decisive" contribution
to research into energy options for the year 2025 and beyond.

PAPOUTSIS CALLS FOR PRE-COMPETITIVE ENERGY TECHNOLOGY POLICY.

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

"This is an opportune moment to define a Community-wide policy for
pre-competitive activities in the field of energy technologies, with the
main objective of meeting the urgent needs of EU industry and society at
large", said Energy Commissioner Christos Papoutsis during a conference on
October 11. He warned that while EU firms are among the world leaders in
the manufacture and supply of clean and efficient energy technologies, the
European Union has been less successful than the United States and Japan
in the diffusion of research and the development and marketing of proven
technologies. A future initiative for energy technologies must focus not
on the development of technology per se, he explained, but rather on its
use to meet the immediate needs of the market and the citizen. It must
also contain activities dealing with all the stages in the technological
development process, including R&D and market commercialisation.

COMMISSION LAUNCHES JOULE PROJECT SELECTION INVESTIGATION.

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The European Commission has decided to launch a detailed inquiry to ensure
that the procedural rules governing EU funds for Joule projects of
research into renewable forms of energy are obeyed without exception,
Research Commissioner Edith Cresson has responded in answer to a
Parliamentary question about the falsification of Joule programme expert
reports. The Commission has already publicly denied and demonstrated to
the European Parliament that these accusations - the latest appearing in
the Austrian magazine Sonnenzeitung - were false, the Commissioner said,
and it "vigorously refutes" any unjustified allegations made against the
Ezio Andreta, the Director responsible for research and technological
development projects concerning energy. However, Commissioner Cresson
confirmed that another Commission official involved, Wolfgang Palz, has
been assigned to other duties - with his consent - while awaiting the
results of the inquiry.

VAN MIERT SEEKS "CLARIFICATIONS" OVER ELECTRABEL ACCORDS

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert has written to the
Belgian Government asking for "clarifications" over plans by the power
utility ELECTRABEL, to force local authorities into long-term electricity
supply contracts, it was revealed on October 22. In March this year,
Electrabel, which is privately owned, offered the Belgian intercommunales
(joint ventures between municipalities for electricity distribution) the
chance to buy stakes in the company in return for signing 30-year
electricity distribution contracts. Mr Van Miert has repeatedly said that,
under EU rules on free and fair competition, he will not accept contracts
lasting more than 15 years.

The Commissioner is now reported to have asked the Belgian authorities for
a clearer explanation of how much freedom the local authorities will have
to end the contracts with Electrabel and choose to go to another supplier.
An EU source said that although the Commission had recently received a
letter from Leo Peeters, Flemish Minister for Home Affairs, agreeing "in
principle" to the 15-year contracts, Mr Van Miert was concerned about
recent indications that the parties to the agreements might be planning a
U-turn over commitments made in May for a definite reduction in their
duration.

EUROPE'S LARGEST WIND ENERGY PLANT OPENS IN WALES

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The largest wind energy plant in Europe began operating on October 23,
according to NATIONAL POWER, the British electricity production company.
Located in Carno, Wales, the plant is capable of producing enough energy
to meet the needs of 25,000 homes. The plant, equipped with 56 turbines
and able to generate up to 33 megawatts of electricity, cost National
Power GBP26 million (about USD41 million). According to Hugh
Babington-Smith, Executive Director of the British Wind Energy
Association, 10% of the UK's electricity could be produced by wind by
2025. If the Government adopted this goal, 13,000 new jobs could be
created in wind energy production. Currently, about 150,000 people in
Britain get their electricity from 31 wind energy plants. "We have 40% of
Europe's total wind resources, but we risk falling behind the rest of the
world in wind energy development", Mr Babington-Smith added. The County of
Powys, a rural area of Wales, will now obtain 40% of its electricity from
four wind-powered generating plants.

FRENCH PETROLEUM INDUSTRY EXPANDS DURING 1996

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The French upstream oil industry is expected to see a slight increase in
turnover during 1996, to about 49 billion French Francs from 48 billion in
1995, according to an annual survey by the French Petroleum Institute
(Institut Francais du Petrole - IFP), the Committee on Oil and Marine
Studies (Comite d'Etudes Petroli
res et Marines - CEPM) and the Groupement
des Entreprises Parapetroli
res et paragazi
res (GEP) published on October
22. Next year also looks promising, with three-quarters of the companies
surveyed (accounting for 65% of turnover in the industry) expecting their
business to grow. Service providers were particularly optimistic. Despite
strong international competition, the French oil industry has once again
managed to play an important role on the world market, according to
figures provided by the IFP, CEPM and GDP. The world oil exploration and
production market is estimated at between USD110 and 120 billion,
including the countries of the former Soviet Union. France claims a 6%
market share. In 1995, turnover in the upstream oil industry, at 48
billion Francs, was 6% higher than the year before. The increase was
particularly marked in the offshore sector, which had a 32% rise in
activity, followed by a slight slump in 1996. More than 80% of turnover is
generated outside the country and climbed from 25 to 40 billion Francs
between 1990 and 1995. The share of business in the rest of Western
Europe, outside France, is estimated at FF13 billion. The UK, Norway and
the Netherlands are major customers, but Germany and other European
countries are also valuable markets. French firms conduct nearly
one-fourth of their foreign business in Africa. However, they are minor
players in North America and particularly the United States.

BRITISH ENERGY TO SHED 1,460 JOBS OVER THREE YEARS

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

BRITISH ENERGY, which owns and operates Britain's eight most modern
nuclear power stations has rocked the trade unions by unveiling plans to
shed 1,460 jobs over the next three years. The workforce of the company
privatised in mid-July will be reduced to 4,800. British Energy's Managing
Director, Robert Hawley, lays claim to a clear and simple strategy to
reduce costs and improve efficiency in order to ensure the nuclear energy
company can continue to compete effectively with conventional electricity
generation. Mr Hawley has reiterated the company's promise to never
compromise its total commitment to safety, insisting there would be little
point in reducing staff numbers if safety standards could not be
maintained. The plan is expected to secure wage cost savings of about
GBP50 million per year. British Energy will, however, need to offset
restructuring costs of about GBP100 million, which will be covered by
existing funds and spread over three years.

The restructuring at British Energy is part of a general trend of job cuts
in the privatised energy sector. By the year 2000, British Energy will
have reduced its 1992 workforce by 40%. POWERGEN and NATIONAL POWER,
Britain's leading traditional generators, will have reduced their
workforces by 71 ands 63% respectively.

FOREIGN INVESTORS FLOCK TO GAZPROM

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

GAZPROM will enter international markets at the relatively high price of
USUSD1.57 a share, with foreign investors queuing up for a share of the
jewel of Russian industry. However, analysts are still questioning whether
Gazprom, which holds a quarter of global gas reserves, is really a good
deal or rather an over-weight monster that will always be tarnished by the
stigma of the Soviet era. The company has announced profits of USD3.5
billion for 1995, but accounts will only be published according to
international standards from this year, providing a more accurate
barometer of its health.

The conglomerate has announced that Gazprom shares will begin trading on
international stock markets on October 28, at USD15.75 for batches of ten
shares. Company Chairman Rem Viakhirev, has indicated that the share issue
is heavily over-subscribed despite the fact the price is three times
higher than on internal stock markets (about USD0.6 a share). Gazprom will
issue 23.7 million batches of ten shares -American Deposit Stocks (ADS)-
representing a little more than 1% of the company. This initial sale is
expected to raise USD400 million, with Gazprom planing to float a further
8% of capital on the international markets. The share price values the
conglomerate at USD38.5 billion, a fairly modest sum, given that Gazprom,
a giant even by monopoly standards, sells nearly USD8 billion worth of
natural gas to the West each year. A brochure published by Gazprom at the
beginning of the year, estimated the company's real value at closer to
USD5 a share. Despite being Europe's leading gas exporter, with a
workforce of 230,000 employed in 40 subsidiaries, and 145,000 kilometres
of gas pipelines throughout the former USSR, Gazprom nonetheless remains a
high risk enigma for foreign investors.

ON-SHORE BUSINESS SHAVES 7% OFF NORSK HYDRO PROFITS

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The Norwegian group NORSK HYDRO (oil, gas, chemicals, petrochemicals,
fertilizers) has announced a 7% fall in pre-tax profits over the first
nine months of the year, blamed on a decline in "on-shore" activities
which higher than anticipated oil prices have been unable to offset. At
8.403 billion Norwegian Krone (USD 1.292 billion), profits are NKr 450
million short of analysts' forecasts, and compare with a profit of NKr
9.023 billion over the corresponding period last year. Norsk Hydro
turnover is up 6% from NKr 59.464 billion to 63.121 billion (USD 9.710
billion), with operating profits down 9% to NKr 7.899 billion.

The company is blaming the fall in profits on a decline in revenue from
on-shore activities. High prices for aluminium and petrochemical products
last year have fallen back this year. In addition, the group has been
forced to tap operating profits to pay higher taxes brought about by an
increase in the proportion of revenue from the oil and gas sectors. Norsk
Hydro Chairman Egil Myklebust claims this varied picture again illustrates
how the company's diverse activities have a balancing effect on our
revenue. He believes the group's avowed goal of securing an operating
profit of NKr 10 billion for the year as a whole is still within reach.

The oil and gas sector has seen a 96% increase in operating profits to NKr
4.291 billion (USD 660.1 million) over the first nine months of the year,
thanks to the high price of hydrocarbons and increased production, up 17%
to 3.4 million tonnes oil equivalent. The average price of crude oil has
risen 32% over the third quarter to NKr 136 (USD 20.9) per barrel. In 1995
the group posted record pre-tax profits of NKr 11.089 billion (USD1.706
billion).

SHELL THREATENS TO PROSECUTE ROMANIA'S CRP

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

Anglo-Dutch oil multinational ROYAL DUTCH SHELL is threatening to bring
charges against the state-controlled Romanian oil company CRP, which it
has accused of discriminating against private clients. In an open letter
dated October 15 and signed jointly with the Italian oil company AGIP,
Shell argues that the creation of CRP this Summer threatens to represent
"a step backwards" with "disastrous consequences" for the Romanian oil
industry. If CRP wants to take a step forwards it must respect two
fundamental principles: profitability and non-discrimination. However
recent practices have, according to Shell, highlighted flagrant violations
of these principles. The company claims that refineries controlled by CRP
tend to discriminate against independent distributors, and in favour of
other clients that have close ties with the company, despite being "bad
payers". A CRP spokesman has rejected these accusations, insisting that
Shell has enjoyed the same treatment as other clients. Since moving on to
the Romanian market two years ago, the Anglo-Dutch giant has established a
chain of service stations around Bucharest and plans to extend its network
throughout the country. Shell warns that if the current situation
continues, CRP will have to answer in court for the abuse of its dominant
market position, and indeed violation of the Energy Charter that Romania
signed. The World Bank, which has granted Romania a USD175 million loan to
regenerate the oil sector, recently condemned the creation of the CRP as
"contrary to market deregulation".

ELF OFFERS OUTLETS FOR QATARI GAS

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The French oil company ELF AQUITAINE has highlighted access to outlets as
part of its bid to participate in liquefied natural gas projects in Qatar.
Speaking on October 17, on the sidelines of an international gas
conference in Abou Dhabi, Bruno Karcher of Elf's gas division indicated
that the French oil group believes it can guarantee outlets in Europe for
LNG from Qatar, which has the region's second largest gas reserves,
estimated at 7,000 billion cubic metres. Mr Karcher indicated that this
offer has been passed on to the Qatari Government. The state-run
conglomerate Qatar General Petroleum Corporation (QGPC) is the majority
shareholder in three LNG export projects, one of which, Qatargas, should
be operational by the end of the year. The other two, Rasgas and
Enron/QGPC are still at the planning stage. The foreign partners in
Qatargas are MOBIL (United States), TOTAL (France) and the Japanese
companies MITSUI and MARUBENI, and outlets have already been secured in
Japan for all Qatargas production. Rasgas, in which Mobil has a 30% stake,
has thus far placed only a quarter of maximum projected production in
South Korea. Finally, the American company ENRON and QGPC are expected to
finalise an agreement to build a third gas liquefaction plant later this
year. Enron plans to market production in Israel, Jordan and India.

INAUGURATION OF THE MAGHREB-EUROPE GAS PIPELINE

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline will be opened at the end of October or
the beginning of November, Algeria's Energy Minister Amar Makhloufi
announced on October 14, indicating that final tests are progressing
according to plan. Begun in 1994, the pipeline will link Algeria's Hassi
R'Mel gas field to the Spanish city of Seville, via Morocco and the
Straits of Gibraltar. 1,265 km long and with an initial capacity of 8
billion m3/year the pipeline will initially supply the Spanish and
Moroccan markets, and later Portugal, France and Germany, as capacity
increases to 20 billion m3/year about the year 2000. With the entry into
service of the Maghreb-Europe pipeline, the second structure linking
Algeria to Europe, after the Transmed pipeline laid at the beginning of
the 1980s between Hassi R'Mel and Italy, Algeria expects to double gas
exports by the beginning of the next millennium.

GREEN LIGHT FOR ELF NEGOTIATIONS ON NEW DEPOSIT IN AZERBAIJAN

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The Azerbaijani President, Gueidar Aliev, has authorised the French oil
company ELF AQUITAINE to finalise negotiations on becoming the principal
operator of an major exploration zone in the Caspian Sea. Announced on
October 11, the Presidential green light coincided with the French Foreign
Minister Herve de Charette's visit to Baku, on the last stage of a
three-day tour of the Caucuses that took him from Armenia to Georgia and
finally to Azerbaijan. ELF is now free to pursue negotiations with the
Azerbaijani oil company SOCAR, and draw up a definitive agreement for the
exploration and exploitation of the Leninakan offshore field, which may
contain up to 50 million tonnes of oil. The agreement will leave ELF
controlling the field with a 75% stake in operations.

Joel Bouchaud, Elf's Director for the Orient, the CIS and Latin American,
explained that the company's objective will now be to finalise an
agreement before President Aliev's the official visit to France on January
13. Mr Bouchaud indicated that once contracts have been exchanged, Elf may
surrender a part of its stake. In April 1995 ELF missed out on an
important contract for the exploitation of the Chirag-Azeri-Gunshli field,
now operated by the Americans. In June, Elf secured a 10% stake in the
exploration of the Chahdeniz field controlled jointly by BRITISH PETROLEUM
and the Norwegian company STATOIL. Azerbaijani oil reserves are estimated
at about a billion tonnes. 8 million tonnes are currently extracted
annually, compared with 40 million tonnes during Azerbaijan's Soviet
period.

RWE TO RAISE DIVIDENDS FOR 1995/96

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

On October 19, RWE, Germany's leading regional energy utility, announced
net profits of 1.2 billion Deutschemarks for the 1995/96 financial year
(July to June) a 10% improvement on the previous year. Turnover has risen
2.9% from DM 63.6 billion to 65.4 billion. The group proposes to raise its
share dividend from DM 1.40 in 1994/95 to DM 1.50. These figures are in
line with provisional results published at the beginning of July.

RWE's Board has also announced the appointment of Clemens Boersig to the
post of Financial Director from April 1, 1997. 48 years old, Mr Boersig is
currently a member of the Board of ROBERT BOSH GmbH. Two Directors of RWE

COAL USE AND OUTPUT IN WESTERN EUROPE STILL FALLING

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

With coal use in Western Europe expected to continue its decline as more
and more energy efficiency and ecological control measures are
implemented, the urgent application of clean coal technologies will be
essential in asserting a role for coal in sustainable energy development,
the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) reported on
October 10. In a survey of coal developments in Eastern and Western Europe
in 1995/1996, the ECE says the future of coal will increasingly depend on
the electricity industry as demand from other sectors, such as
coke-making, is forecast to continue declining. Some 85% of the hard coal
and virtually all of the brown coal consumed in the ECE region (which
covers both East and West Europe) was used for heat and electricity in
1995, compared with only about 12% of ECE hard coal output used for
coke-making. Coal provides close to 40% of the ECE region's electricity,
and after oil and natural gas is the area's most important source of
primary energy.

The UN/ECE notes that the decline of coal production in Europe has
accelerated since 1990, with hard coal output falling about 30 million
tonnes (or 5%) in 1995, taking it to 19% of global output as compared to
25% in 1990. While a temporary stabilisation of output is forecast for
1996, further reductions are planned for the 1996-2005 period, especially
in Germany, France, Poland and Russia. Overall European coal exports have
also declined from some 80 million tonnes in 1990 to 70 million in 1995;
Western European exports have virtually ceased.

EU PETROL AND HEATING OIL PRICES UP ON OCTOBER 21

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

All categories of EU fuel and heating oil prices rose between October 7
and October 21, according to figures from the European Commission's Energy
Directorate-General (DGXVII). Continuing a four-week trend, the average
price of premium-grade petrol rose slightly from ECU 216.92/1,000 litres
to ECU 220.61/1,000 litres, Euro-super unleaded premium-grade was up to
ECU 232.46/1,000 litres from ECU 227.30/1,000 litres, and motor diesel
jumped to ECU 251.14/1,000 litres from ECU 238.60/1,000 litres. Heating
oil prices increased to ECU 221.41/1,000 litres from ECU 219.50/1,000
litres (and rose as high as ECU 225.58/1,000 litres on October 14), and
residual fuel oil prices were up to ECU 123.99 from ECU 119.83 per 1,000
litres on average.

ELECTRICITY: EUROPEAN PRODUCTION BELOW OECD AVERAGE IN JULY

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

European electricity production increased by 3.1% in the first seven
months of 1996 as compared to the same period last year, while output in
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development region as a
whole rose 3.6%, the International Energy Agency announced in its monthly
electricity survey published on October 10. By way of comparison,
increases of 4.6% were registered in the United States, 3.3% in Japan,
1.7% in Canada and 1.2% in Australia.

Electricity output in OECD Europe increased by 1.4% to 187.8 terawatt
hours in July 1996 compared with twelve months before, and nuclear and
thermal electricity production increased by 6.4% (to 60.7 TWh) and 3.7%
(to 88.6 TWh) respectively. In contrast, hydro-electric power generation
fell, for the second month in a row, by 10.0% to 38.5 TWh

US electricity output declined by 1.3% (to 288.9 TWh), due primarily to a
drop in thermal and nuclear power generation of 2.2% (to 199.8 TWh) and
1.7% (to 61.0 TWh) respectively and a 6.6% rise in hydro-electricity
production (to 28.2 TWh).

Electricity output in Japan increased by 4.7% following an 8.3% rise in
nuclear production, a 7.3% rise in thermal electricity output and a drop
of 14.2% in hydro -electricity generation.

Canada also saw an increase in electricity output; but only of 1.5%,
resulting from a rise in hydro-power generation of 10.9% and a fall in
nuclear and thermal electricity production of 15.6% and 8.0% respectively.

NORWAY EAGER TO SELL GAS TO POLAND.

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The Norwegian Foreign Minister, Bjorn Tore Godal, has indicated that his
Government would support the sale of gas to Poland. Accompanying King
Harald V on an official visit to Warsaw on October 15, Mr Godal's
declaration came after a meeting with his Polish counterpart Dariusz
Rosati. The two Ministers nevertheless agreed that the conclusion of
concrete agreements should be left to specialised companies. Mr Rosati
claims that Polish companies have long been interested in purchasing gas
from Norway, as Russian gas supplies will be insufficient to cover demand.
Moreover, the Minister is aware that Poland would do well to diversify its
supply sources, in order to guarantee energy security. At the end of
September, Poland signed an important contract with Russia covering the
supply of 250 billion m3 of Siberian gas over 25 years. The first three
billion m3 should reach Poland in 1997, with supplies rising to 14 billion
m3 per year by 2010.

TAXATION/EXCISE DUTIES: COMMISSION SOON TO PROPOSE TAXES ON ALL ENERGY
SOURCES

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The European Commission is expected to come up with a proposal before the
end of November for an increase in minimum excise duty rates on mineral
oils and the inclusion of other energy sources - electricity, natural gas,
coal and perhaps even biofuels - in the excise duty system. If the
proposal is approved by the full team of Commissioners and the Council of
Finance Ministers (which could be more difficult), excise duties on
mineral oils would gradually be increased, particularly in those Member
States that currently have the lowest taxes. With the proposed energy/CO2
tax stalled for the past four years, the Commission's main goal is now to
win acceptance for the principle of some kind of tax, no matter how small,
on all energy sources. The proposal, which puts more emphasis on the
principle than actual tax rates, has already created "very serious
tensions" within the Commission, according to well-placed sources.

Since January 1, 1993, the Member States have been required to set excise
duties rates on mineral oils above a Community minimum rate (expressed in
ECU) for each product and its particular use (heating oil, lead-free
petrol, etc.) under Directive 92/82/EEC governing excise duties on mineral
oils. The same excise duty system covers tobacco and alcoholic drinks too
(although the Commission does not intend to modify the rates for these
products at the moment). A closer convergence of duty rates among the
Member States within the Single Market to prevent distortions of
competition was one of the Commission's and the Member States' objectives
in adopting this system. Some current minimum rates are listed below.

* Heavy fuel oil: ECU 13 per 1,000 kg

* liquefied petroleum gas and methane for industrial use: ECU 36/1,000 kg

* leaded petrol: ECU 337 /1,000 litres

* lead-free petrol: ECU 287/1,000 litres

Commission sources say that minimum rates should now be increased, not
only to keep pace with inflation, but also as a first step towards a
closer approximation of rates (setting a minimum rate tends to be
ineffective, since market forces push rates downward, according to
experts). This approximation of rates would discourage cross-border
shopping and would incorporate environmental concerns into policies in
other areas, now that the specific proposal for an energy/CO2 tax has
foundered. New rates should be high enough to create an incentive, but not
so high as to ruin the proposal's chances of adoption by the
Commissioners, informed sources explain. To soften the psychological and
practical impact of these measures, the increase would be gradual.
Commission experts speak of raising rates by about 30% over five to ten
years, but this is only theoretical. Several Directorate-Generals - DG III
(Industry), DG XXI (Taxation), DG XI (Environment), DG XV (Internal
Market) and DG XVII (Energy) must still consult among themselves.

Most of the Member States apply taxes at levels well above Community
minimum rates. But others (Portugal, Greece, Ireland and Luxembourg)
impose rates on certain products (some types of mineral oils) that are
equivalent to or only slightly higher than the minimum. These Member
States would eventually be required to raise their minimum rates to comply
with the new European minima (and for this reason are likely to oppose the
proposal in Council). The rise would also concern those States whose rates
are already well above the minimum rates. "This increase would give Member
States with high excise duty rates more room to manoeuvre, making excise
duties higher everywhere", says an expert on this issue, also bringing up
the concept of shifting taxes on labour to other bases, preferably with a
positive impact in terms of environmental protection.

These are exactly the arguments that have spurred the Commission to
broaden the scope of application of the Directive on excise duties to
include other energy sources such as coal, natural gas and electricity.
The Commission's first concern seems to be winning acceptance for the
principle of taxation of these products, regardless of the rate, as a
first step towards compensating for the failure of the energy/CO2 tax
proposal. As mentioned earlier, even biofuels could be include in this
proposal, which would thus supersede Directive 92/81/EEC on the structure
of excise duties on mineral oils, that on excise duty rates (92/82/EEC)
and the draft Directive on excise duty reductions for biofuels (still held
up in the Council).

AUSTRALIA LIFTS EMBARGO ON URANIUM SHIPMENTS TO FRANCE

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The Australian Government announced on October 21 that it would lift the
embargo on new deliveries of uranium imposed in 1988 in protest of French
nuclear tests in the Pacific. This decision came in response to France's
signing of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the Australian Minster of Foreign
Affairs and Trade, Tim Fischer. The embargo covered new uranium contracts,
but not those signed before it took effect. Mr Fischer emphasised that
France's accession to the Treaty marked the fulfilment of promises it made
on January 29 to stop all nuclear testing. Australia's uranium export
policy prohibits sales of uranium for other than peaceful uses.

During the crisis sparked last year by French nuclear tests on Mururoa
Atoll, Australia's Labour Government refused to impose a total embargo on
shipments of uranium to France, explaining that such a measure would cost
Australia more than France. The decision to lift the embargo was
immediately condemned by environmentalists, who claimed that France had
not promised not to use Australian uranium for military purposes. "The
fact that the Australian Government seems ready to do anything to sell
Australian uranium is unfortunate", said Jim Downey, head of an Australian
conservation association, adding that France had not yet proved its good
faith on nuclear issues.

Australia originally imposed an embargo in 1983, lifted it in 1986 and
reapplied it in 1988. According to the Australian Uranium Information
Centre, Australia currently has orders for AUSD11 million (eight million
US Dollars) worth of non-enriched uranium, representing only 3% of
France's needs, but accounting for about 10% of Australia's exports.
Uranium Miner Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA) sells 272 tonnes of
concentrated uranium oxide to France each year, at AUSD40,000
(USUSD30,400) per tonne, under a long-term contract with Electricite de
France (EDF). ERA's Director, Phillip Shirvington, indicated that the door
was now open for new exports, but that extensive negotiations were still
required. "This decision allows us to extend our contract with EDF when
the current one expires in the next century and to sign other contracts",
Mr Shirvington added.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION: ENERGY SECTOR PLANS UNDER 1997 WORK PROGRAMME

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

"1997 will be a watershed year marked by three major events: the
Inter-Governmental Conference, Economic and Monetary Union, the financial
package for post-1999 and enlargement", Jacques Santer told the European
Parliament, meeting in plenary in Strasbourg on October 22. The President
of the European Commission was presenting his institution's work programme
for 1997, along with a report on the implementation of the 1996 programme.
While the Commission's main priorities as the turn of the century nears
are growth and employment, development of a European model of society and
closer relations with third countries, actions are also foreseen in the
energy and environment fields. Mr Santer's presentation did not sway the
Parliament, however, which gave the programme a critical reception and
accused the Commission of legislative inertia.

Among the measures proposed specifically for the energy sector are a
proposal on the promotion of clean coal technology (CARNOT) and
communications on a renewable energy strategy, a cogeneration promotion
strategy, on the role of energy management in regions, cities and on
islands, on the part played by technology and strategy for energy RTD, and
on the harmonisation of nuclear transport conditions. The Commission also
plans to engage in negotiations on radioactive waste and Euratom accession
and revise legislation on compulsory oil stocks and on the price
transparency of crude oil and oil products. (See the list of planned
Commission actions below.)

I>"The Single Market has taken shape but it remains incomplete", the
Commission notes in its Work Programme. It therefore plans to work right
throughout 1997 to win the Council's agreement on several pending pieces
of legislation, including that on opening up the internal market for
natural gas. The Commission will put more pressure on the Member States to
speed up their transposition of Directives needed for the proper
functioning of the Internal Market. Rules on state aid will be assessed in
terms of their impact on employment. The Commission will also continue its
efforts to simplify legislation.

The Commission plans to propose measures to make companies better able to
compete, particularly in high-tech sectors; defend its Fifth Framework
Programme for Research and Technological Development; and take initiatives
to stimulate innovation at the conclusion of the process of consultation
on the Green Paper it unveiled this year.

As concerns the environment, apart from the revision of the Fifth Action
Programme - Towards Sustainable Development, the Commission wants to be a
"driving force" in preparations for the Conference to be held in 1997 as a
follow-up to the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992.

List of planned Commission actions in the energy, environmental protection
and research and development areas in 1997:

electricity market Directive cannot be defended from an economic, social
or legal point of view, and it compromises the rights and interests of
distribution companies, the European Confederation of Public Communal
Energy Distributors (CEDEC) says. "The existing version of the Directive
leads to a division of the single electricity market in two: on the one
hand, a privileged group of 'eligible clients' that can freely choose
their supplier in Europe and negotiate their prices, and on the other
hand, clients that will remain tied to their current distributor and upon
whom prices will be imposed as in the past", CEDEC argues in its October
newsletter.

"In fact, it would be economically and socially inadmissible that the
advantages of liberalised electricity production and sales on European
markets benefit only large industrial consumers of electricity", while
small consumers are excluded from the advantages that increased
competition will bring, CEDEC continues. CEDEC groups national communal
energy distribution associations in Belgium, Germany, France, Italy and
Austria.

EU/VENEZUELA: EUROPEAN BUSINESSES ENCOURAGED TO INVEST

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

Venezuela is reforming its economy and European companies are welcome to
invest in several industries, including those in the energy sector. This
is the message the country is sending out through a series of seminars on
"Doing Business in Venezuela" being held this month in Amsterdam,
Brussels, Madrid, Milan and Padova as part of an effort to diversify
sources of investment and enhance the country's access to new markets.
"Venezuela is the best kept secret in Latin America", Luis Xavier
Grisanti, Ambassador to the EU, Belgium and Luxembourg told Europe Energy
on October 16. But with opportunities for foreign investors abounding and
seminars like the one in Brussels on October 14 attracting 115
participants from the financial, industrial and international services
sectors, the secret may not remain concealed for long.

The Ambassador said that potential investors are being attracted primarily
by the country's extensive privatisation programme and other open market
reforms such as the abolition of exchange and price controls - including
petrol and electricity price rises - liberalisation of interest rates and
the reduction of the fiscal deficit. These are being implemented as part
of a global macro-economic stabilisation programme, called "Agenda
Venezuela," that aims to help the country get fully back on its feet after
a serious financial crisis in 1994.

A long list of assets and companies up for privatisation by early 1997
includes several electric power systems, including the Nueva Esparta State
Power System, Energia Electrica de Barquisimeto (Enelbar) in the state of
Lara and the Enelven-Enelco power system in the state of Zulia. The gas,
petrochemical, coal and oil sectors are also being opened to foreign
investment; a first round of tenders for "share-risk contracts" in new
areas of oil exploration has already taken place, and bidding for
operational contracts for marginal wells is to be held in 1997. With
USD1.3 billion spent in 1994 on purchasing materials and equipment for the
oil industry, opportunities for companies providing goods and services
also exist.

The seminars, in which high-level officials such as Venezuela's Planning
Minister Teodoro Petkoff, Deputy Minister of Energy and Mines Evanan
Romero and Bank Deposit Guarantee Fund President Esther de Margulis have
participated, are being sponsored by the Government of Venezuela, the
European Commission and the National Council for Investment Promotion
(CONAPRI). A series of similar meetings is taking place in the United
States.

COMPETITION: VAN MIERT CONSIDERS FUTURE OF OIL SALES COMPETITION
EXEMPTIONS

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The European Commissioner for Competition, Karel Van Miert, is considering
a proposal for a two-year extension of rules - which are due to expire at
the end of 1997 - that exempt exclusive supply and distribution agreements
in the oil and beer sectors from European Union competition rules under
Article 85.3 of the EU Treaty. The Commission said on October 16 that the
proposal was to avoid a "legal vacuum" that could occur if the existing
"block exemptions" from EU competition rules were to expire before
consultations on the Commission's Green Paper on the long-term future of
exclusive supply and distribution agreements, due to be published by early
1997, were concluded. The Green Paper, also known as the vertical
restraints paper, is already a year overdue.

The Regulations at stake cover tens of thousands of agreements by which a
supplier, on the one hand, appoints a reseller as his exclusive
distributor in a given area (Regulation 1983/83), and on the other hand, a
reseller agrees to buy all his products from one supplier only (Regulation
1984/83). These exemptions from normal EU competition rules currently
allow oil companies to make exclusive supply agreements with petrol
stations.

The Green Paper is expected to call for the review of agreements within
the oil, beer and perfume sectors and also to address the issue of
franchising, covered by a separate block exemption which expires at the
end of 1999. One solution which could be put forward in the Green Paper
would be to carry on with sectoral block exemptions. Another would be to
base exemptions on the market share of the company operating the
restrictive agreements. In the meantime, when Mr Van Miert makes a formal
proposal for the extension of the rules, his decision must be approved by
the full team of Commissioners.

The European oil industry, represented by Europia, is especially concerned
that if the block exemptions were rescinded, petrol distributors which now
benefit from acceptable exclusive purchasing or supply agreements could
suffer in a climate of increased uncertainty. In informal talks with the
Commission's Directorate-General responsible for Competition on the
preparation of the Green Paper, the industry has already indicated that
while it would like the legal certainty provided by Regulation 1984/83 to
continue, the regime could be improved. Europia suggested that the new
regime should allow a duration of 10 years or more for the exclusive
purchasing agreement, which would lead to adequate return on capital
employed, and the inclusion within the exclusive purchasing regime of
lubricants, company fuel card schemes and all-convenience store goods.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO CREATE ENERGY ADVISORY COMMITTEE

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The European Commission is likely to adopt by early November a Decision to
create an Energy Advisory Committee, as called for in its December 1995
Energy Policy White Paper, as part of an effort to establish an informal
but institutionalised dialogue with the energy sector and ensure its
support when new areas of action in the energy field are chosen. This
Committee will be expected to assist in identifying energy policy areas
where Commission action is deemed to be necessary, provide advice on the
means needed to implement Commission proposals and give opinions on these
proposals before they are finalised.

The Committee is to be composed of 31 representatives of energy producers,
distributors, consumers, unions, and associations dealing with the
protection of the environment. During the preparation of the White Paper,
all these interested parties had indicated to the Commission the priority
they place on dialogue and transparency in the formulation of EU energy
policy.

COGENERATION: NEW POLITICAL SUPPORT EXPRESSED AT CONFERENCE

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

In a special report on the recent conference on Prospects and challenges
for Europe's cogeneration markets, freelance journalist Steve Hodgson,
writing for Cogen Europe, looks at how a new political momentum is
building toward a new cogeneration strategy, what elements Cogen Europe
thinks this strategy should contain, and what cogeneration's prospects are
in a liberalised electricity market.

Prospects for an EU cogeneration strategy have received a major boost from
Peter Scholten of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. Speaking at
Cogen Europe's annual conference in Brussels on October 10-11 (see last
issue of Europe Energy), Mr Scholten announced that the proposed strategy
will be on the agenda for the May 1997 Energy Council under the
forthcoming Dutch EU Council Presidency if the Communication from the
Commission on the subject is presented in time.

Earlier during the conference, Joanna Tachmintzis, a member of Energy
Commissioner Christos Papoutsis' Cabinet, said that Europe's cogeneration
industry is entering "a new phase in its development," and that new
cogeneration capacity will be an essential element of efforts to curb
Europe's CO2 emissions in the coming years.

She added that the prospects for cogeneration will boosted by both the
proposed internal electricity market Directive and by the Communication on
cogeneration from the Commission, which is due to be published early in
1997. This strategy will be framed to take account of both EU
environmental and energy policy objectives and could, said Ms Tachmintzis,
include an EU target for cogeneration, something for which Cogen Europe
has long been calling.

As well as setting a European target for cogeneration, Cogen Europe
believes that the strategy should also:

*provide ongoing monitoring of market barriers to cogeneration in each
country,

*prioritise cogeneration's position within the EU's carbon reduction
programmes, and

*establish cogeneration support programmes for central and eastern Europe.

Another major conclusion from the conference was that the liberalisation
of electricity markets currently taking place in Europe will aid the
development of decentralised cogeneration plant but may harm prospects for
existing city-wide cogeneration/district heating systems. Many national
electricity markets are already moving towards more competitive and
transparent structures, a trend which helps cogeneration and which Cogen
Europe supports.

The amount of cogeneration used in each country is a function of its
history, climate and level of industrialisation, but also of the
prevailing legal/regulatory/market framework. While only some 7% of
Europe's electricity is generated by cogeneration, three countries - the
Netherlands, Denmark and Finland - generate more than 30% in this way.
Cogen Europe suggests that a 30% share could be achieved across the
continent by 2010, providing ECU 140 billion of investment opportunities,
new jobs and massive CO2 cuts.

Announcing the preliminary results of a major Cogen Europe study at the
conference, UK and Danish consultants Ilex and Ramboll said that
liberalisation helps cogeneration in industry, buildings and small-scale
district heating schemes by allowing energy users to self-generate their
own power and by removing a number of market barriers. City-wide systems
may need protection in a more competitive environment.

Equally importantly, liberalisation promotes more progressive utility
thinking as well as structures, said Ilex/Ramboll, and increases customer
choice. Thus the UK energy markets, perhaps the most liberalised in the
EU, have helped cogeneration grow by 50% since the electricity industry
was first privatised in 1990.

Cogen Europe believes that, to be helpful to cogeneration, national
frameworks should include greater competition in electricity generation,
more open access to the transmission system and a service-oriented
distribution system. If these measures were accompanied by moves to
reflect environmental costs in energy prices, this would help cogeneration
begin to meet its enormous potential in Europe, both East and West.

Over 230 delegates attended the conference to learn about the latest moves
from Brussels and to hear presentations on the prospects for cogeneration
within 13 countries, among them 10 EU Member States, Hungary, Poland and
the Czech Republic. Cogen Europe was able to report that it now has 117
members, including a network of 11 national promotional organisations.

GADONNEIX TO PRESIDE OVER GDF AFTER FRENCH TOP JOBS RESHUFFLE

Pierre Gadonneix has been appointed president of Gaz de France (GdF)
following the sudden move of his predecessor, Loik le Floch-Prigent, to
take over running the state railway company, SNCF. Employees of the
latter provided the backbone to the recent wave of strikes in France
(EER 449/15): le Floch-Prigent was chosen by Paris because he manages
to combine socialist politics with managerial competence.

Gadonneix, who was appointed the general manager of GdF in July 1987,
had already been passed over for the top job twice. In 1988, when
Jacques Fournier left, it went to Francis Gutmann. In 1993, Gadonneix
saw le Floch-Prigent appointed over his head.

It remains to be seen how far Gadonneix will pursue the
internationalist and market-oriented policies of his predecessor. He
must renegotiate the company's charter with the government, which
defines its activities. In its home market, GdF faces challenges from
both electricity and fuel oil, and could also face an assault on its
monopoly of gas distribution.

Internationally, Gadonneix must manage those GdF assets already
acquired in Canada, Uruguay, and the US. Eventually, he will also have
to face pressure from Brussels to deregulate, even if the European
Commission has concentrated on electricity in the first instance.

In a spell at the industry ministry, Gadonneix worked with liberally
inclined ministers such as Michel d'Ornano, Rene Monory, and Alain
Madelin. But he will face fierce opposition from the country's trade
unions to any liberalisation. The unions had already designated 4
January as the next day of action to defend French-style public
service.

In fact, le Floch-Prigent's plans to exchange shareholdings with the
Russian gas company Gazprom were always likely to cause problems if he
had got anywhere near putting them into practice. The fact that cur-
rent industry minister Franck Borotra favours selling minority stakes
to Elf or Norway's Statoil, or to individuals, will do Gadonneix no
favours.

The appointment of Gadonneix contrasts with the recent politically
motivated parachutage of Edmond Alphandery (EER 449/2) at the head of
Electricite de France (EdF). But like Alphandery, Gadonneix will take
part in nominating his deputy, thereby strengthening his authority,
though there was no awkwardness between Gadonneix and his former
president, as there was under the 'ancien regime' at EdF.

Among the names being mentioned for the general manager's post are the
current deputy general manager Jean Balazuc, as well as the director of
the industry ministry's energy department, Claude Mandil.

ITALY UNVEILS PLAN FOR ENEL SALE AND LIMITED DEREGULATION

With shares in hydrocarbons conglomerate ENI now trading on
international stock exchanges (EER 488/7), Italy has begun to firm up
plans to divest state power utility Enel.

The Enel sell-off will not, however, take place as rapidly as some,
including budget minister Rainer Masera, had hoped for. Instead,
premier Lamberto Dini opted for the more cautious approach favoured by
industry minister Alberto Clo: the privatisation will take place over
the next two to three years and will be accompanied by power sector
reforms.

There may be further changes in the Enel sell-off arrangements, not
least due to the uncertain governmental situation, with Dini having -
as promised - submitted his resignation at the start of the year only
for it to be rejected by Italy's president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.

In the meantime, the administration said the government stake in Enel
could be lowered to less than 51%, even though this was the level
suggested by parliament.

In his losing arguments, budget minister Masera had pushed for speedier
and more comprehensive privatisation, saying that the government needed
to send "strong and clear-cut signals" to potential investors and that
Enel's fragmented sale would be "a grave error".

The government outlined a plan for a three-phase privatisation. The
first stage calls for the sale of a certain amount of Enel shares - the
figure of 30% has been mentioned - within the first few months of 1996,
coupled with changes in Enel's accounting and management, including
production, distribution and transport.

The second phase will involve the flotation of a second tranche and a
new government policy on electricity. The third part of the process
will see the sale of the last segment of shares to be sold, with the
state losing overall control but hanging on to a substantial interest.

Despite its privatisation, however, there seems little doubt that Enel
will continue to be the dominant force in Italian electricity, even if
in private hands. After the necessary go-ahead from the government's
anti-trust authority, which is now studying the Enel case, the utility
will retain certain exclusive rights, particularly in distribution.

Despite the proposed liberalisation, the government reaffirmed the
principle of the "single rate" and, among other guidelines, the
"universality of electric services".

As for production, this will be open to competition only for additional
energy supplies deemed necessary, including from abroad "on the basis
of reciprocity" and within EU regulations. Other producers can either
sell their energy to Enel or negotiate directly with "qualified
consumers", meaning large agencies or concerns.

Nationwide, Enel will be designated the 'single buyer' responsible for
distributing electricity from producers to distributors and users. High
voltage transmission will also be handled by Enel to some 70 municipal
utility companies.

Enel described such stipulations as "important because, while
substantially maintaining the unity of Enel, they open the market to
competition in harmony with EU regulations."

But the plan drew mixed reactions from observers. Some lauded the
cautious sell-off approach and the accompanying reforms, while others
said the scheme did not go far enough and fell some way short of full
liberalisation. The municipal utilities of the larger cities,
accounting for about 7% of electricity consumed in Italy, were
particularly critical. Enel accounts for about 79% of power used.

COMMISSION HOPEFUL ON POWER

The European Commission is still hoping to reconcile member states to a
single agreed text for deregulating the electricity market.

Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert recently told a conference
organised by the Les Echos newspaper in Paris that the Commission could
wait to see whether a consensus was possible in the New Year.

Elsewhere, Energy Commissioner Christos Papoutsis insisted that there
was no blockage, and that all contentious questions would be resolved.

When member states' industry ministers held their delayed Council
meeting on 20 December, they unsurprisingly failed to agree, but
promised to restart negotiations in the New Year. Furthermore, the
Commission pointedly failed to invoke Article 90-3 of the Treaty of
Rome, which allows it to impose directives.

The Spanish energy minister, who presided over the meeting, said that
all the difficulties were surmountable, and that all of the conditions
were in place to reach agreement in the coming months.

The Commissioners appeared to be taking the view that it was the
strikes and demonstrations in France that were impeding agreement,
since the French government needed to prove that it was serious about
defending 'public service'.

One possible structure of a compromise could be to designate power
distributors among those consumers allowed to choose where they bought
their electricity. This should provide a measure of freedom for the
supporters of liberalisation, led by Germany but including the UK and
the Nordic countries, while allowing France enough leeway to leave
Electricite de France largely in control of its electricity
distribution.

French industry minister Franck Borotra reiterated his claim that
France was happy to let large industrial consumers benefit from
competition, provided that it could continue to organise its market
around the idea of public service, which meant security and continuity
of supplies, along with equal prices and equal access.

CO2 TAX SCHEDULE IN JEOPARDY

The resignation of Austria's finance minister Andreas Staribacher on 2
January will likely postpone introduction of the country's proposed
energy/CO2 tax on gas, coal and electricity. The tax had been intended
as a companion measure to the levy on mineral oils and fuels which went
into effect last May (EER 431/8).

Staribacher had been under considerable pressure to impose the extended
tax as part of a programme to resolve an unbearably large budget
deficit projected for this year. State industry minister Viktor Klima
has now been named as his successor.

The energy tax concept was originally proposed to reduce CO2 emissions
in line with Toronto targets; when it became clear that the Toronto
goals would not be met, the tax as applied to petroleum reverted to a
general income source.

Arguments have been flying back and forth over the amount of the tax to
be applied to gas and electricity (EER 444/9), one factor which has
delayed extension of the levy to energy sources beyond petroleum.

In addition to Staribacher's resignation, federal chancellor Franz
Vranitzky is faced with the challenge of forming a new government
following elections last month. That factor, plus the ministerial
change, as well as renewed debate over the size of the tax and its
utilisation - restricted or general - will probably postpone any
possible introduction of the levy until after mid-year at the earliest.

NESTE SELLS SOVEREIGN INTEREST TO UK REC NORTHERN ELECTRIC

Neste Corporation, the state-owned Finnish oil and gas company, has
signed a letter of intent to sell its 50.5% stake in Sovereign
Exploration to Northgas, a subsidiary of the UK regional power
distributor Northern Electric, Neste confirmed.

In February 1994, Neste and Northern Electric formed an upstream gas
company based on Neste's Southern Gas Basin interests and including the
Victor Gas field. As well as Victor, Sovereign Exploration also holds
interests in the Schooner field, which is scheduled to start production
at the end of 1996.

The sale of Sovereign Exploration marks Neste's latest phase in
divesting non-essential oil production and exploration holdings. The
company had earlier sold its UK oil assets to Sweden's Sands Petroleum
in a deal worth FM899m ($207m), as well as its oil and gas exploration
interests in the US.

Instead, Neste intends to re-focus on its upstream activities on the
Norwegian continental shelf, according to Neste's E&P planning manager,
Jyrki Haapio.

"We will also concentrate on upstream activities in the Middle East and
Russia," said Haapio. "This re-focusing of operations will result in
Neste moving its international business unit, responsible for our
Middle East operations, from London to Dubai."

STATOIL PLANS 1996 OUTPUT BOOST

Norwegian state-owned oil company Statoil expects to produce an
estimated 480mbbl of oil in 1996, the company's in-house magazine
Weekly Status said. Statoil produced 448mbbl in 1995, down from 460mbbl
in 1994.

This year's expected increase was attributed to the Heidrun and Yme
fields. Heidrun is now pumping at capacity and Yme will begin
production in a few weeks, the magazine said. Heidrun produced
218,491bbl on 1 January, thus achieving the goal of 200,000bbl/d at
year-end by a wide margin, Statoil added.

But the publication said an increase in production at Statfjord
satellites and the start of output at Heidrun in 1995 was not enough to
offset a considerable decrease at the old, giant Statfjord and Gullfaks
fields. It said production at Statfjord and Gullfaks would continue to
fall in 1996.

Norway, which pumped more than 3mbbl/d in November, is second only to
Saudi Arabia in the world's league of oil exporters.

* Norwegian oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) production hit a new
record in November, according to analysts Wood Mackenzie. Output
averaged 3.19mbbl/d, 1,000bbl/d higher than the average level produced
in October, Wood Mackenzie said.

"Output from Heidrun continued to come onstream averaging 87,000bbl/d
for the month and production from Troll oil increased to 187,000bbl/d,"
said Wood Mackenzie in its December report on North West Europe. But
production from the Snorre, Gullfaks and Statfjord fields, loaded
offshore, fell slightly.

Danish oil and NGL production, meanwhile, fell by 4% to 182,000bbl/d in
November due to lower output from the Gorm and Skjold fields, said Wood
Mackenzie. Dutch oil and NGL output rose to 45,000bbl/d during
November, up almost 10% from October's 41,000bbl/d.

STATOIL REPORTS MAJOR FIND

Norwegian oil company Statoil appears to have made the biggest oil
strike in the Danish North Sea sector since the Skjold field was
discovered in 1977.

Preliminary reports indicate that the Siri-1 field, which lies only 6km
from the border with the Norwegian sector, contains as much as 150mbbl
of oil - sufficient to meet Denmark's oil requirements for three years.
The find is worth an estimated DKr15bn ($2.7bn).

Statoil reckons production at Siri-1 can start as early as 1998 because
the oil is in comparatively easily accessible strata. The find was made
2,200 metres underground in an area where the sea depth is 60 metres.

Denmark's energy minister Svend Auken expressed satisfaction that the
find was made so quickly after the recent granting of new exploration
rights in the fourth Danish round of concessions.

The interests in the fourth round licence in which the find was made
(6/95) are as follows: Statoil (operator) 50%, Enterprise Oil 20%, Dong
20% and Denerco 10%.

RECORD OUTPUT PREDICTION

UK North Sea oil figures due for release this month are expected to
reveal record output levels, according to the Royal Bank of Scotland
Oil and Gas Index. Analyst Mark Shea said figures for November and
December last year were expected to show peak production.

He said oil output for November was likely to have equalled or beat the
previous peak of 2.82mbbl/d recorded in January 1985. But figures for
December were expected to be even higher.

Shea went on: "We are expecting this peak because we know which oil
fields have come on stream and what production levels are likely to be.
However, we cannot guarantee peak output will be achieved."

Shea said the increasing production was down to a number of major
factors, such as advancing technology and cost-cutting by the oil
companies. "We are now seeing fields producing oil long after they were
forecast to run dry . . . These figures, despite the current low price
of oil, highlight how healthy the industry is and how important UK
investment is to the rest of the world."

SPAIN PLANS $200M REFINERY PIPELINE LINK BY 1997

A Pta25bn ($203m) oil pipeline will link Repsol's Puertollano and
Cartagena refineries in 1997, the industry and energy ministry said
last December.

Puertollano, in the central Spanish province of Ciudad Real, is the
only refinery in Spain not situated at a port and is the best placed to
meet rising demand for oil products in central Spain.

The 350km link will improve supplies of crude oil to the refinery, and
lead to an increase in capacity from 7mt/yr to 7.5mt/yr. The project
will receive Pta10bn ($81m) from the EU under the European Regional
Development Fund programme.

The port of Escombreras, Cartagena, is currently undergoing work which
will allow it to admit 125,000cm capacity tankers initially intended to
allow greater entry of liquefied natural gas to the Cartagena
regasification plant. The link to Puertollano opens up greater
possibilities for Cartagena as a point of entry for crude oil.

* The Banco Bilbao Vicaya (BBV) has increased its interest in Repsol
from 4.5% to 5.13% to gain fiscal advantages offered to groups
controlling a more than Pta60bn of share capital in another. The move
takes BBV ahead of Pemex (4.99%) as number two institutional Repsol
shareholder behind the Spanish state (21%). Madrid is expected to sell
around 7% of Repsol before the upcoming March general election.

CEPSA SET TO BEAT SALES RECORD

Cepsa, Spain's largest private oil refiner, is expected to surpass the
Pta1bn ($8m) sales mark for 1995. Up to November, the company reported
consolidated sales of Pta960bn, and gross profits of Pta29.18bn, 19.9%
up on the same period for 1994.

Stronger domestic oil product sales, up to 17.2mt (0.6% up) and
improved refinery margins gave added impetus to a strong chemicals
performance registered earlier in the year.

The company invested Pta46bn over the first 11 months of 1995, with the
main priority being the company's RKF and ORD blocks in the Algerian
Sahara. The company expects the first of these to produce 12,000bbl/d
later this year, rising to 30,000bbl/d by the start of 1997.

Cepsa has countered speculation in local press reports of 600mbbl of
reserves in the ORD block, saying that further research is necessary
before it can comment on volumes.

ESSO SAYS IT WILL STOP LEADED PETROL MARKETING THIS YEAR

By mid-1996 demand for high-grade leaded petrol should be so low in
Germany that Esso will stop marketing it. The warning came as Esso
unveiled plans to rationalise its retail petrol network.

According to Herbert Kirchhoff, head of the oil company's filling
station business, the share of leaded super in total petrol sales fell
to 6% last year, from more than 30% as recently as 1990. In 1996 it
will reach only 2.5%, Esso says.

Kirchhoff estimates that 5% of all cars registered in Germany - just
under 2m vehicles - are still in the market for leaded super. To offer
them an alternative, Esso - like its competitor Shell - has launched an
erosion protection additive which must be added to each tankful of
unleaded. Some 70 Esso filling stations are already no longer selling
leaded super.

Meanwhile, the concentration process in the filling station business
has continued unabated in Germany. In the 25 years to 1994, the total
number of filling stations plummeted by 60% - from 44,600 in the former
West Germany to 18,300 in unified Germany, 2,000 of which are located
in the east.

In the case of Esso this means that it cut the number of its own
stations from 5,560 to 1,627. Thanks to the restructuring, average
petrol and diesel sales per station jumped - from 470,000 litre/yr to
2.5m litres/yr.

With an 8% share in the German filling station market, Esso accounts
for 12% in total motor fuel sales. The company points out that with
3.6m litres/yr per station, Esso's own sales exceed the average annual
figure by one-third, giving a turnover of DM7m/yr ($4.9m/yr) per unit.

Due to estimated investments of DM400,000 per station in additional
environmental protection measures needed to comply with new
legislation, the total number of filling stations in Germany is bound
to shrink further.

Esso's own plans foresee the closure of about 250 stations, with the
construction of 50 new ones, predominantly in east Germany, also
envisaged. This would leave the total number of Esso stations at around
1,400, with 150 of them in eastern Germany.

In its survey of German energy consumption in the past year, Esso
points out that the German refineries are once again losing money. It
complains that while crude imports into Germany in 1995 dropped by 4%
to 101.9mt, oil product imports rose by the same percentage rate to
42.8mt. As a result, average refinery utilisation dropped to 92.2% from
95.5% in 1994.

Combined with high German production costs, this led to losses in the
downstream sector, surpassing those recorded a year earlier. Thus, two
refineries closed down last year. Consequently, overall distillation
capacity dropped to 111.9mt/yr from 113.1mt/yr in 1994. At the same
time, the sector invested in additional conversion capacity at the
remaining refineries which led to an increase of 2% to 47.5mt/yr.

With deliveries of 20.7mt, the CIS was Germany's largest supplier of
crude last year, despite the fact that the volume was down 9% on 1994.
A close second was Norway, which upped its crude exports to Germany by
4% to 20.3mt, followed by the UK which raised them by 11% to 18.5mt.

Deliveries from Libya dropped 3% to 11.4mt. As a result, German crude
receipts from the North Sea (38%) surpassed those from OPEC countries
(35%) for the first time.

Sales of oil products in the German market were up 1% to 127.3mt last
year. Petrol consumption rose only 1.7% to 30.3mt, although motor
registration figures showed an increase of 2% to 40.7m vehicles. Sales
of unleaded jumped by 1mt to 28.6mt.

Thanks to the ongoing construction activity in east Germany, and
Germany's increasing role as a transit country, demand for diesel
expanded by 4.1% to 26.6mt. By contrast, demand for LFO continued to
fall, despite lower temperatures at end-1995 compared to a year
earlier: sales dropped 2.8% to 35mt.

Against that, HFO sales rose 2% to 7.7mt, thus registering growth for
the first time in two years. However, Esso does not see any expansion
potential in this line in the long run, due to ever stricter
environmental provisions.

IPIC IN OMV SHAREHOLDER SPAT

Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC), a 19.6%
shareholder in OMV, and the government's holding corporation OIAG, are
sparring over possible changes to OMV's shareholder base.

OIAG is seeking to sell off at least 24 percentage points of its
present 49% OMV stake; unless IPIC boosts its holding, an OIAG sell-off
could trigger clauses in the syndicate agreement running to 2010 under
which Abu Dhabi bought into OMV in 1994 (EER 412/5). The agreement
guarantees government buyback of the IPIC holding should OIAG's share
fall below 30.1%.

OIAG to date has failed to convince IPIC to boost its holding to a
controlling 25.1%. At the same time, the Austrian group has failed to
agree to an IPIC representative on the OMV board; the syndicate
contract called for two board seats.

An alternative further privatisation via public sale on the Vienna
stock exchange has been discounted by OIAG due to the depressed market.

Difficulties on the IPIC-OIAG shareholder level notwithstanding, OMV
has hopes of winning an opportunity to participate in a $1bn
polyethylene plant to be built in Abu Dhabi. The emirate expects
Western investors to take up 35% of the project.

OMV is experienced in polyethylene production through its plastics
subsidiary and rates its chances in Abu Dhabi "at over 50%", according
to OMV general director Richard Schenz.

HELSINKI TRIGGERS PROTESTS WITH REMOVAL OF PRICE SUBSIDY

Finland's largest industrial users of Russian-sourced natural gas are
lobbying Neste to maintain prices at 1995 rates this year. The action
follows the Finnish government move, on 1 January, to discontinue the
provision of subsidies aimed at increasing the competitiveness of gas
imported from Russia, and which was worth around FM20m/yr ($4m/yr).

The removal of the state gas subsidy, triggered by the ongoing
harmonisation of Finnish economic provisions with EU measures, caused
an automatic rise in the price of natural gas.

With industrial companies opposed to paying the extra charges, Neste is
being asked to absorb the cost differential left over following the
expiry of the subsidy. The state company has refused to take on the
added cost.

The industrial protest group is headed by forest companies Enso,
Ahlstrom, Kymmene and the power distribution company Etela Suomen
Voima. Gas supplies are handled by Gasum, the joint venture company 75%-
owned by Neste and 25% by Russia's Gazprom. Finland imported Russian
gas worth FM1.3bn in 1994.

The dispute is currently in arbitration and could yet end up in the
country's marketing court. Obstructing the way to a solution is a 10-
year price and supply contract, signed in 1990 and not due to expire
until the end of the decade.

Industrial companies claim that this contract constrains Gasum to
adhere to a set price strategy over the 10-year period to 1999. Gasum
argues that the 1990 contract did not take into account Finland's
membership of the EU in 1994, which was regarded as a remote
possibility when the contract was signed.

British Petroleum Portuguesa and Petrogal, Portugal's state-controlled
oil company, have added their names to the list of international energy
companies interested in buying a stake in Transgas, Portugal's natural
gas utility, when it is privatised in a process expected to begin in

Petrogal's interest in the acquisition of a holding has reportedly been
welcomed by Jose Penedos, the secretary of state for energy in the new
Socialist government.

Penedos has said that the previous government's plans to sell a
dominant stake in Transgas to a strategic partner are being

COMPLAINTS OVER 'HIGH' PRICES

German industry pays more for its gas purchases than industry in any
other EU country other than Portugal, according to the VEA association
representing the interests of industrial energy consumers.

According to Eurostat figures for January 1995, the average price of
gas in the EU is 22% lower than average prices in Germany if Portugal,
which currently uses only town gas at very high prices, is left out of
the picture. Industrial customers in the UK pay the lowest prices,
followed by Spain, France and Luxembourg.

This regrettable state of affairs lays a heavy burden on German
industry, says the VEA. Countless jobs have been shifted abroad on
grounds of cost, and if something is not done about reducing the price
of energy to industry, "further considerable damage will be done to the
domestic industrial sector".

The VEA puts the blame on lack of competition in Germany. The
demarcation and concession contracts which give the gas companies their
own monopoly supply areas must be abolished, it demands. At the same
time, the VEA stressed its support for the so-far unsuccessful
proposals for a liberalisation of the energy markets made initially by
the federal economic affairs ministry some two years ago.

EVN SUCCESS IN HUNGARY

Among Austrian bidders for a share in Hungary's gas privatisation (EER
449/12), only regional utility EVN managed a successful offer.

Jointly with Germany's Bayernwerk, EVN now holds 50% plus one share in
Koegaz, a regional gas utility serving about 190,000 customers in a
southwestern region encircling Lake Balaton and extending to the
Slovenian and Croatian borders. The consortium joint investment amounts
to $67m, up $20m from its first bid.

EVN will have few immediate gains from the deal; the service territory
does not border on Austria, as would have been the case had EVN gained
a hold in other Hungarian gas utilities for which it had bid.

Nevertheless, EVN's success is unlikely to induce much pleasure with
Austria's state-controlled gas monopoly, OMV, which failed in its
Hungarian bids.

EVN's deal further strengthens its ties with the German utility, with
which it shares major stakes in Austria's private gas and oil producer
RAG. OMV and the 51% state-owned electricity authority Verbund have
felt themselves threatened by Bayernwerk, which has made offers on
several Austrian privatisations.

DRAFT DOMESTIC LICENCE DETAILS

The deregulation of the UK's domestic gas market was set to draw a few
concrete steps nearer as EER went to press with the government expected
to publish the requirements it will impose on interested companies
within days.

With the first, limited stage of the liberalisation to take place in
the West Country from April, the department of trade and industry was
to publish draft proposals for gas supply and shipper licences.

Parties interested in competing with British Gas (BG) in the 18m
residential consumer market will require a supply licence, while those
that want to transport gas through BG's pipeline grid will also need a
shipper's licence.

The eagerly anticipated licences were expected to offer an insight into
the type of liberalised market the government has in its sights.

GERMAN IMPORTERS PREDICT 10% SLUMP IN 1996 SALES

The German coal importers federation says it expects coal sales to
suffer a decline of 10% in 1996.

Purchases of fresh coal are expected to be postponed as major consumers
use up the "comfortable" coal stocks which were accumulated during the
'Jahrhundert' contract, which expired at the end of 1995. Sales of both
German and imported coal are expected to be affected to the same
degree.

It is all the more ironic that import coal prices will probably remain
at their current low level during 1996, assuming no significant shifts
in currency rates take place - "proof of the continuing value for money
of imported coal", stresses the importers' association.

In the first 10 months of 1995, imported steam coal prices averaged
DM76/t ($53/t) hard coal equivalent (hce), while German steam coal cost
virtually four times as much at DM291/t hce before subsidies took
effect.

CDF STRIKE SETTLED QUICKLY

A strike by miners at the Charbonnages de France (CdF) subsidiary
Houilleres du Bassin de Lorraine ended quickly after miners obtained
concessions, notably an increase in wages. The minimum salary for 1995
was increased from FFr81,000 gross for the whole year to FFr85,000
($17,125), with a bonus of FFr550 per man offered before the end of the
year.

Earlier, some 4,000 miners had clashed with CRS riot police in front of
the company's offices at Freyming-Merlebach (in the Moselle
department). The miners, armed with pick-axe handles, bolts, and hoses,
confronted some 200 CRS officers, and 500 mobile gendarmes. Some 50
persons were injured, of whom two seriously.

Workers at three of the four mines belonging to the company - Reumaux,
Simon and Wouters - went back immediately after the offer. But the
Houve mine at Merlebach held out a little longer, the local branch of
the CGT union not wishing to give the impression of giving in to the
management too quickly.

RWE VOWS TO FIGHT ON TO BRING MUELHEIM-KAERLICH BACK ON LINE

RWE Energie, the operator of the 1,300 MW Muelheim-Kaerlich nuclear
power station off-line since 1988, is adamant that it will continue the
legal battle to bring the reactor back on stream (EER 448/17).

The dispute has already turned into the longest and most costly battle
through the courts in the history of German jurisprudence, according to
Klaudia Martini, head of the environment department in Rhineland-
Palatinate where the reactor is located.

The energy concern announced that it has decided to appeal to the
federal administrative court. This is in defiance of a recent verdict
from the superior district court in Koblenz finding that the first
partial construction licence for the unit, overhauled in  1990, was
invalid and that there was no appeal against this ruling.

But RWE Energie claims that the oral verdict contained a faulty legal
evaluation and that therefore an appeal was justified. Furthermore, a
damage claim filed by RWE - which might amount to half the reactor
construction costs of DM7.8bn ($5.4bn) - is still pending with the
federal supreme court.

Martini has, meanwhile, suggested to RWE that it re-equip Muelheim-
Kaerlich for electricity generation from another primary energy source.
At the same time, she turned down a motion for the opening of formal
reactor closure proceedings, tabled by the Greens in the state
parliament.

Martini argued that such a step would open a can of worms, with RWE
bound to fight every inch of the way for the subsequent partial
construction licences which were all in force. Martini assumed that
this state of affairs would not change, even if RWE were granted an
appeal and tried, for the third time, to get a "new" first licence. It
was now up to RWE "to set a sign of reconciliation in the region by
renouncing a continuation of the legal fight for a first partial
construction licence."

REACTOR SABOTAGED BY SALT

About the time of the first moves by French trade unions to defend
their concept of public service in early December, employees at the
Blayais nuclear power station at Braud-et-St-Louis, in the Gironde
department, were suspected of putting sodium chloride (table salt) into
the secondary cooling circuit of the plant's number three unit.

According to the director of the power station, Martine Griffon-Fouco,
the act could only have been committed by someone with clearance for
access to the site. The management asked the local police to
investigate.

The salt did not present any great danger to the plant, but could, in
due course, have damaged the cooling circuit. Furthermore, there were a
number of other incidents in preceding days, such as unexpected turbine
stoppages. These various incidents were described as "malicious acts",
some way short of sabotage.

NORDIC MARKET BEGINS TRADING

The world's first market in international power trade began operations
on 2 January with Norwegian and Swedish players trading electricity for
NKr28m ($4.4m), officials said.

"Volume was relatively good," said a spokesman for Statnett Marked,
Norway's domestic electricity bourse company. "A gradual escalation is
expected." The joint power pool is based on the same floor as the
Norwegian domestic electricity market, which started regular trading
last spring.

The spokesman said 180 GWh were traded, including 160 GWh by telephone
and 20 GWh by telefax. This compared to 85 GWh on 29 December, before
Swedish traders entered the market, but dealers attributed the rise to
the prevailing cold spell.

Norway and Sweden removed border tariffs on electricity from 1 January,
allowing producers and consumers to trade power freely between the
neighbouring states. The jointly owned wholesale power pool is seen as
a starting point for a much wider market encompassing Finland and
Denmark.

In 1994, Statnett traded 25% of total Norwegian electricity
consumption, amounting to NKr5bn in turnover. This year trade is
expected to total one-third of consumption.

The exchange offers a day ahead, or physical, market, and a weekly or
futures market.

Meanwhile, against the backdrop of the liberalisation of Sweden's
electricity market, Finnish state energy company Imatran Voima (IVO)
signed an electricity supply agreement with Sweden's TelgeKraft worth
FM348m ($80m).

The contract covers the supply of 300 GWh over the three-year period
1996-1998, with first deliveries scheduled to begin as soon as 24
January.

"The agreement with IVO is significant, and was based on an open
competition where the best price pitched won," said TelgeKraft's CEO
Kjell Hasslert.

Under the agreement, IVO is contracted to supply electricity produced
using renewable energy resources "whenever feasible". This portion of
the contract will require IVO to source power supplied to TelgeKraft
from hydro and biofuel-fired power plants.

Founded in 1993, TelgeKraft is controlled by some of Sweden's largest
industrial groups, including Ericsson, Telge Energi, Scania and Astra.
The company concentrates on the purchase and distribution of energy to
its shareholders, and is forecast to purchase 1.5 TWh of electricity
from Nordic suppliers in 1996.

DISTRIBUTION CONTRACTS DISPUTED

Belgian power utility Electrabel has defended its ongoing negotiations
for 18-year distribution contracts with local authorities, saying they
are needed to ensure long-term investments and are to the benefit of
consumers.

Freddy Willockx, a Belgian Socialist member of the European parliament,
has claimed Electrabel's efforts to tie part-local authority-owned
companies to 18-year distribution contracts threaten EU liberalisation.

Electrabel restarted talks with local authorities in November over the
18-year contracts, which would be made in exchange for the authorities
taking 5% stakes in Electrabel production units, Willockx said.

An Electrabel spokesman said: "The European Commission is interested in
the interests of consumers, and a free and open market is not the
bible. The most important aspect is the interest of the consumer."

"We pledge ourselves to have investments with municipalities in inter-
municipal distribution companies," the spokesman continued, "but we
will not make long-term investments if we are in short-term contracts."
Willockx was "blind to the economics of the investment", the spokesman
added.

The Electrabel spokesman confirmed the contracts are linked to the
municipal authorities buying Electrabel shares, which will take place
during the first half of the year. The 2,577,256 Electrabel shares,
representing about 5% of the company's capital, are currently retained
by holding company Tractebel, although they were acquired by Electrabel
in 1992 as part of an acquisition, he said.

The shares were subsequently transferred to Tractebel, which holds a
substantial stake in Electrabel, to meet demands from the Belgian
banking and finance commission regulator, he said.

Under the transfer agreement, Electrabel will receive any capital gain
or loss made when the shares are sold to the municipalities, which will
be made at a market price, he said. The shares were acquired at a
valuation of BFr5,600 ($188.74), he said.

GEC, CEGELEC BUY AEG ASSETS

French concerns GEC Alsthom and Cegelec, both linked to Alcatel
Alsthom, have signed a preliminary agreement to buy what remains of
Daimler-Benz's electrical business, AEG. The price was not disclosed.

GEC Alsthom is to take over the transmission and distribution (T&D)
businesses of AEG, which should boost its turnover in this field by
some FFr7bn ($1.4bn), bringing it to FFr18.5bn/yr. It will also give
the company coverage of 35 countries against 24 previously, and make it
the largest company in T&D, ahead of ABB and Siemens.

For Cegelec, taking over AEG's industrial process control business will
boost its turnover in Germany to the equivalent of FFr6.5bn from the
current FFr1.4bn (which compares with worldwide turnover of FFr16.4 bn
for the whole of 1994).

In addition, the takeover will give Cegelec a higher profile in Central
Europe, the Americas (north and south), and in South Africa, as well as
some fresh clients in the petroleum industry.

AEG will retain 49% in the holding company that is to be established to
run these businesses, while GEC Alsthom will get 51%. One consequence
of the restructuring that will follow the takeover is likely to be job
losses. In the meantime, however, Daimler-Benz was still negotiating
the possibility of contributing financially to some of the changes.

EVS/BADENWERK HYDRO TAKEOVER

A consortium of seven Baden-Wuerttemberg power suppliers, headed by EVS
and Badenwerk, is to take over Neckar, the utility operating 24 hydro
stations on the river Neckar between Mannheim and Plochingen.

Up to now Neckar has been owned by the federal government (63.5%) and
by the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg (35%), which are parting with their
shares "for financial reasons".

The consortium will pay DM138.3m ($96m) for 99% of the shares. Neckar
generated 582.7 GWhe in 1994. According to EVS, this is twice as much
as it produces itself from hydro power, and equals 3.7% of its total
electricity generation.

EVS' own power sales reached the record level of just under 21 TWh in
1995. This was an increase of 5% against a year earlier. It was due
chiefly, according to chairman Wilfried Steuer, to a steep rise in
electricity deliveries abroad - up 33%.

EVS also pitched in and helped temporarily with the tight supply
situation of French power giant Electricity de France (EdF), hit by the
recent strike. At the time, EVS supplied roughly 5 GWh per day.

But it could only generate part of the overall volume itself. For the
rest it depended on purchases from east German supra-regional power
supplier Veag.

However, even without the booming foreign business, EVS sales would
have gone up. Power consumption in its own supply area also rose last
year - by 2.3% against 1994. Due to the flagging economy, Steuer
expects deliveries to EVS' own supply area to increase by 1-2% only in
1996.

HUNGARIAN POWER STAMPEDE

Following VEW and Ruhrgas' successful entry into the Hungarian gas
market - via participations in a regional (DDGAZ) and a municipal
(Foegaz) gas supplier (EER 449/20) - other German energy concerns have
hastened to make sure they will play a role in Hungary's electricity
privatisation.

RWE and its junior partner, southern German regional concern EVS,
bought 46.15% of Elmu, a distributor serving the greater Budapest area
with sales of 7.8 TWh/yr, and 48.8% of Emasz, serving the northeast
with sales of 4.7 TWh/yr.

The grouping also acquired a 38% stake in brown coal producer Matra,
consisting of an 800 MW power station and two opencast mines. The group
was granted the option to increase its stakes in all companies to 50%
and one share by end-1997. It is planning to invest around DM1bn
($693m), chiefly in Matra, over the next few years.

Bayernwerk won a majority stake in southwestern supplier Dedasz (sales
of 3.6 TWh/yr), while upper-Bavarian regional utility Isar-Amperwerke -
which Bayernwerk is striving to take over - acquired 49.23% of eastern
Hungarian supplier Titasz (sales 3.1 TWh/yr), together with the option
to raise its stake to 50.1% by end-1997.

RAINS BREAK HYDRO DECLINE

Spain's plunging hydroelectric production spiral finally bottomed out
in November last year after significant rainfall broke the drought.

According to figures published in December by Spain's network company,
Red Electrica de Espana (REE), the sector registered a fresh record
minimum for daily generating output before mid-month rainfall led to
the first notable production lift since March last year.

Rains in the second week boosted the daily producible power figure to
154 GW for 16 November, the first time this figure had overcome the 150
GW mark since the first week in March 1995. This improvement came just
over two weeks after REE reported the new record output low at 13 GW on
1 November. This was 2.27 GW lower than the previous minimum set on 22
October 1995.

Six months of announcing successive record-breaking lows for the
contents of Spain's hydro generating reservoirs also ended in November
when REE said the water level nationwide had edged above the line
marking the previous November minimum, reaching 26.9% of their total
capacity.

This is the first time for six months that the water level in
reservoirs has not set a fresh monthly minimum record, having plummeted
since the end of January 1995.

The gap between the median figure and the real amount of collected
water has been widening steadily since February 1994. Indeed, over the
last three years, the real figure has been higher than the median for
only six months; this was in one single spell from September 1993 to
February 1994.

The disparity in reserves is echoed in REE's production figures for the
month of November as a whole: the 1. 255 TWh hydro-generated in
November 1995 was vastly lower than in the corresponding months of 1994
and 1993 - 42.7% and 62.9% less respectively.

While total production for the month, including all power producing
sources except autoproducers, was 3.7% up, coal and nuclear-generated
power made up the difference increasing output by 19.8% to 6. 97 TWh
and 7.5% to 4.65 TWh respectively.

The 12.571 TWh total November demand took the figure for the first
eleven months to 138.339 TWh, 3.9% higher than the same period in 1994.

Even heavy rainfall in December is unlikely to lift the total hydro
generation figure for 1995 any higher than the third worst hydro
performance in the last 25 years. The output total to the end of
November in Spain reached 19. 583 TWh, already more than Unesa's two
lowest readings, 19.511 TWh in 1992 and 18.671 TWh in 1989.

Meanwhile, Portugal's five years of drought also appear to be over,
according to meteorological officials, heralding a period of increased
hydroelectric production.

Rainfall in the southern Alentejo region, the area worst hit by
drought, was greater in November and December than in the previous four
years and several regions of Portugal continue to risk flooding.
Agriculture accounts for more than 75% of all water consumption in
Portugal, compared with 14% for industry and 7% for domestic
consumption.

* Strike action in France led to strong power exports from Spain to
France in November 1995, peaking at hourly readings of 1.3 GWh in the
last days of the month, said REE. While Spain's power relationship with
Electricite de France (EdF) is hugely weighted in favour of imports,
43.65 GWh went to France in November, 72% more than in October.
November power imports from France totalled 439.25 GWh. REE signed a
"support agreement" with EdF on 1 November which caps Spanish power
exports at 200 GWh, equivalent, said REE, to 400 hours at a maximum of
500 MW. The agreement covers the period November 1995 to March 1996.

MADRID IMPOSES TARIFF SQUEEZE

Madrid has taken measures to rein in Spain's power sector profits for
1996, freezing tariffs for the first time since 1973 and introducing
tougher controls on sector income.

Acting on advice from the national electricity systems commission
(CSEN), the industry and energy ministry said the moves passed on the
benefits of economic recovery and technological advances to the
consumer.

Between Christmas and New Year, the treasury's superior pricing board
accepted the ministry's recommendation for an average "zero increase"
in electricity charges, justified by estimates of a 3.5-4% demand lift
throughout the year.

This level of confidence foresees a return to the degree of sustained
growth last witnessed during the mid-1980s. The "zero increase" is to
be applied to across the board to all tariff scales; domestic,
industrial and the large-scale industry rate. Last year, tariff scale
alterations produced an average 1.48% increase, well below inflation at
4.3%.

The decision to freeze tariffs followed approval by Madrid's commission
for economic affairs of a revised legal framework reducing recognised
costs borne by the sector by Pta29bn ($236m), 1.42% of the total 1995
tariff.

These alterations would appear to signal an end to the long-running
debate between the CSEN, the major utilities and the industrial
grouping which represents their interests, Unesa (EER 448/19).

Of the seven alterations to the recognised costs borne by the sector,
only two went in favour of the utilities. Worth a total Pta10.28bn,
these are increased allowance for costs brought about by the ongoing
drought, and by the enforced changes to billing methods.

The new arrangements for adjusting the effects of the drought,
calculated in terms of replacing 'lost' hydro-generated power by
increased fossil fuel firing, recognised Pta9.58bn in costs.

The remaining Pta702m will pay for a new billing structure intended to
show consumers how much of their electricity bill will go toward paying
off Pta730bn over 25 years to cover assets lost in the now-permanent
nuclear moratorium, as well as funds that subsidise the coal industry.
These percentages, 3.54% of the bill for nuclear debt pay-off and 5%
for the coal industry, will remain the same in 1996.

The five considerations on the minus side for the utilities subtract
Pta39.39bn from recognised costs: this includes some Pta4.159bn less in
the allowance to pay off generating assets; a reduction of 2-3
percentage points below the retail price index from operating and
generating costs reflecting improved efficiency, totalling Pta10.24bn
next year; some Pta23bn deducted from 'structural' costs; and a further
Pta2bn off as the first step in removing the subsidy for the utilities'
"employee electricity rate" from the tariff.

This is the first time Spanish consumers will not subsidise the
employee rate, a next-to-nothing Pta0.15/kWh, which has remained
unchanged since it was introduced in 1944 when the domestic rate was
Pta0.45/kWh.

Some 66,000 power sector directors and employees, including retired
staff, benefited from this rate last year. The CSEN recommended
employees lose this perk on a gradual scale up to 2001.

ENDESA'S LATIN AMERICA SPREE

Endesa, Spain's 65%-state owned utility, announced Pta35bn ($285m) of
investment in Latin America at the end of December: Pta15bn in Peru and
Pta20bn in Argentina.

Through its 72.5% interest in the Peruvian company Generalima, the
company won 60% control of Eetvensa, proprietor of the 200 MW
Ventanilla power station, close to the city of Lima. Endesa beat off a
competitive bid from American Energy Systems. The remaining 40% of
Etevensa remains in state hands.

Endesa will be responsible, through Generalima, for adding another 100
MW of generating capacity, installing two gas-fired turbines. The
utility also secured a 30% interest in the Lima and Chancay
distribution company, Distrilima, which has 650,000 customers.

In Argentina, Endesa paid some Pta20bn for 19.46% of the Buenos Aires
distribution company, Edenor, lifting its share to 36.46%. Edenor
distributes half of the power sold in the Buenos Aires region.

Also in December, Iberdrola, Spain's biggest private power utility,
bought 100% of two Bolivian distribution companies, La Paz and Oruro,
from Compania Boliviana de Energia Electrica and Bolivian Power Systems
respectively. The investment cost Iberdrola Pta6bn all told, and gives
the Spanish company control of 45% of Bolivia's power distribution
market.

This is the first Iberdrola move outside Spain as a majority
shareholder. It also has a 20% interest in the 250 MW Guemes power
station project and 26% of the Gas Litoral distribution company (both
Argentina).

NO NEW CAPACITY BEFORE 2000

Madrid has said no new power stations will be commissioned up to the
year 2000. The industry and energy ministry has calculated that none of
the potential demand scenarios make additional generating installations
necessary.

Instead, the ministry introduced changes to the current national energy
plan (PEN) for 1991-2000. Chief among these are move to angle
generating policy toward substituting fuel oil as a generating input
with natural gas and biofuels, lengthen the life of existing power
stations, boost renewable energy funding and promote energy saving
initiatives.

The first step toward the achievement of these objectives was the
promise of a January invitation to tender for contracts to convert
1,400 MW of current fuel oil-fired generating capacity to natural gas-
firing. This represents 18.1% of Spain's existing fuel oil-fired
installed power base.

PORVOO REFINERY POWER PLAN

Neste's board of directors has approved plans by the Neste oil refinery
at Porvoo to invest FM72m ($17m) in 1996 to build two to three 70-110
MW gas-fired power plants, Neste Porvoo's general manager Jouko
Huumonen said.

The plan, which was first proposed in June 1994, would involve the
phased development of on-site power generation capacity to supply oil
and petrochemical refining units at Porvoo.

According to Huumonen, Neste hoped to develop the small station concept
and have plants with a total generating capacity of 500-800 MW on site
by the year 2002. Excess production would be channelled into the
national grid.

POWERGEN'S REFINERY CHP DEAL

PowerGen's CHP division has been awarded a contract to supply the
electricity and steam requirements of Conoco's Humber refinery. The
contract will involve the construction of a new gas-fired CHP unit
rated at 24 MWe and over 90 MWth.

The #23m ($35m) plant will feature four independent gas turbines with
back-up systems to ensure continuous running even when the primary gas
supply is unavailable.

To coincide with the plant construction, a connection between the
refinery and the existing Theddlethorpe-Killingholme gas line will be
installed by Kinetica, the PowerGen/Conoco joint venture.

PowerGen CHP managing director Bob Kennett claimed, "We have broken new
ground in meeting the requirements of Conoco for efficient but flexible
plant. Both parties can be confident that the energy supply will
support the refinery's demands in future."

OFFER AMENDS REC LICENCES

UK electricity regulator Stephen Littlechild has published proposals to
modify the licences of regional electricity companies (RECs) SWEB and
Eastern Group following their recent takeovers.

The modifications deal with financial ring-fencing of the electricity
businesses, restrictions on activities, availability of resources,
disposal of assets, and provision of information to Offer. They have
already been agreed by Southern Electric International, now the
majority shareholder in SWEB, and Hanson, the majority shareholder in
Eastern Group, and will be applied to other merged companies in due
course.

Littlechild explained that the "licence modifications will allow me to
continue to regulate effectively and to ensure that customers continue
to be fully  protected."

STEEL AUTOPRODUCER BUYOUT

Electricite de France (EdF) and Edison have completed the purchase of
75% of the independent Italian electricity producer Ilva Servizi
Energie (ISE) for a total of L370bn ($232m).

The deal was initially agreed at the beginning of 1995, but was subject
to conditions which were not met until towards the end of last year.
The purchase was made through a joint company called Finel, in which
Italian firm Edison has 60% and EdF 40%.

ISE is building a 500 MW thermal power station at Taranto (in Puglia),
which will be fired with gases from the blast furnaces of the local
steelworks. It will use combined cycle technology to generate both
electricity, which will be sold to state power utility Enel, and steam,
which will be used by the steelworks.

The project is due to come into operation in the second half of 1996.
ISE already has overall capacity of some 600 MW, including a thermal
power station at Taranto, two at Piombino (in Tuscany), and a hydro
power plant at Terni (in Umbria).

EdF commented that it viewed this as an important step in developing
collaborations with other power generators in countries which wanted to
encourage independent electricity producers.

HEALTHY YEAR FOR VERBUND

A 3% increase in total electricity consumption as well as high water
flows through hydro generating plants have assured a good year in 1995
for Austria's Verbund. At the same time, the federal electricity board
has noted the impact of two major cogeneration plants which have come
on stream, trimming industrial electricity usage.

No specific figures have as yet been released, but the Verbund notes an
export surplus in its electricity trading for 1995. Higher exports to
Germany, Slovenia, Croatia and Hungary have been registered, although
these in part have been achieved at below-cost prices in order to work
down growing coal stockpiles (EER 449/13).

On the financial side, the Verbund experienced costs of some Sch400-
500m last year when its long-term borrowings in Swiss francs had to be
revalued to reflect exchange rate differences. About a fifth of Verbund
bonds are denominated in francs.

TARIFF RULING TO STAY IN PLACE

The Swiss federal government will maintain its SFr0.16/kWh ($0.14/kWh)
tariff recommendations for autoproducers, which were due to end on 31
December, for a further three years. The move follows an official
evaluation report, which also urges that autoproducers be better
informed about the federal recommendations and legal situation.

After the two and a half years that the federal tariff recommendations
have been in force, the situation is that the recommendations are
applied "almost entirely" by electricity companies in less than a third
of Swiss cantons (eight).

They are followed only in part in nine cantons, while five other
cantons refused to provide any information for the evaluation, and the
recommendations are entirely ignored in the principal hydro cantons of
Graubuenden, Ticino and Valais, where the difference between the
production cost of about SFr0.04/kWh and the SFr0.16/kWh recommended
for autoproducers is simply considered too great.

The authors of the evaluation report note that while the promotion of
decentralised energy production is an objective for the country as a
whole, this does not justify forcing the three hydro cantons to accept
conditions which would immediately result in local tariff increases.

Martin Renggli, who heads the Federal Energy Office (FEO)'s energy
policy service, told EER that the SKr0.16/kWh average tariff paid to
autoproducers who use renewable energy sources is the equivalent of the
long-term marginal cost. "Switzerland is virtually the only country to
apply such a tariff, which parliament has limited to non-fossil fuel
producers," said Renggli. "The main beneficiaries are small hydro plant
operators, industrial autoproducers being relatively unimportant in our
country".

Since the recommendations took effect, 80% of small hydro plants (less
than 300 kW) surveyed have seen the prices paid for their energy rise
and profitability improve.

* Switzerland's ombudsman has secured an agreement with five major
regional electric companies for a freeze of tariffs for the next three
years. The five companies are BKW, NOK, Atel, CKW and EOS. Announcing
the agreement, the ombudsman's office in Berne said it was made
possible by the regional utilities' "good, and in some cases very good,
1994 results".

SWITZERLAND ORDERS REDUCTION IN CAR FUEL CONSUMPTION

A new federal ordinance aimed at reducing the specific fuel consumption
of automobiles came into force in Switzerland on 1 January, despite
objections by Swiss car importers. The new ruling is designed to reduce
the average specific consumption, in litres per 100km, of all newly
licensed automobiles by a total of 15% within five years (1996-2001).

The ordinance is designed to make it easier to achieve the objectives
of the federal Energy 2000 programme, and in particular to reduce CO2
emissions attributable to automobiles.

"This reduction rate (of 3% per annum) is technically possible,
economically sustainable, and essential from the standpoint of both
energy and environmental policy," according to a statement by the
Federal Energy Office (FEO).

The FEO points out that automobiles which consume less than 5 litres
per 100km are already available on the market and manufacturers are
already engaged in a process of further improving energy efficiency.
German manufacturers have already announced plans to market 3
litre/100km cars by the year 2000, the FEO notes.

The ordinance makes it mandatory, in particular for car importers whose
role is especially important in Switzerland, to do everything possible
over the next five years to achieve the new "average consumption
threshold values", and thus to contribute to more economic and rational
energy utilisation.

The FEO says this will require a major marketing effort by Swiss
importers, assisted by the federal government. The question of a
special label to distinguish the most energy-efficient cars in the
showroom is currently under consideration.

"This will considerably help the federal Energy 2000 programme,"
according to the FEO. The E2000 objectives include stabilising the
consumption of fossil fuels and CO2 emissions at their 1990 levels by
the year 2000, and thereafter reducing them.

GAS-DRIVEN BUS TRIAL IN BRISTOL

Greener public transport moved one step closer for Bristol when the
UK's first purpose-built gas-powered bus was unveiled by transport
minister, Steven Norris.

The bus, which has been specifically designed to use natural gas,
rather than being converted from diesel power is the result of a five
company partnership - FirstBus Transit Developments, British Gas,
Cummings, Plaxton Coach & Bus and Dennis Specialist Vehicles - and will
be operated by FirstBus.

The spark ignited engine runs off the gas stored in six tanks held in a
specially designed pod on the roof of the bus. The bus will serve the
Temple Meads, city centre, Redland and Clifton areas of Bristol.

Speaking at the launch, Norris said: "Government is aware of public
concern about air quality and the introduction of this new gas bus is
an excellent initiative to help reduce vehicle emissions in an urban
area."

LITTLE CHANGE IN GERMAN INPUTS SEEN BUT CO2 PLANS QUERIED

Primary energy consumption in Germany is expected to remain more or
less constant over the next 25 years, thanks to massive increases in
energy productivity through energy saving and technical progress,
according to a report by Swiss consultants Prognos for the German
federal economic affairs ministry.

The primary energy matrix will only shift marginally during this
period, the report states - the shares of coal, lignite and nuclear
power will shrink, to the benefit mainly of gas, which will increase it
share from 16.8% today to nearly 24% in 2020.

According to the consultancy, oil should maintain its market position,
while renewable energy sources will manage to increase their share from
currently 2.3% to 3.6% by 2020 - low prices for fossil fuels will
prevent a more significant expansion.

CO2 emissions will fall by only around 10.5% by the year 2005 compared
with 1990 levels, with a further drop of just 3% expected by the year
2020.

The drop predicted by Prognos is less than half of the 25% reduction
which the German government has pledged to achieve by the year 2005.
Thus the study casts considerable doubts on the ability of Bonn to make
any real progress on climate protection measures.

Federal environment minister Angel Merkel criticised the Prognos CO2
findings, claiming the effects of new energy and environment policy
measures had been ignored by the Prognos experts.

But the consultants have retaliated sharply, pointing out that all the
significant instruments - such as the new insulation regulations,
amendments to heating boiler regulations, small combustion plant
regulations, support programmes for renewables and voluntary measures
by industry - were indeed taken into account.

Electricity generation in Germany is forecast to continue rising to the
year 2020 by a total of 18% compared with 1992. Gas will play an
increasingly significant role: a net increase in electricity generating
capacity of 13,500 MW will be necessary over the next 25 years, of
which 61% will be gas-fired.

At the moment, installed gas-fired capacity totals 18,750 MW; by 2020
this will have reached 27,000 MW, says Prognos. Some 3,700 MW of new
gas-firing capacity will be constructed in western Germany and 5,100 MW
in eastern Germany, mainly by the new municipal utilities which have
been founded since German unification .

Gross electricity consumption will also rise, by 23% between 1992 and
2020, with consumption in eastern Germany alone expected to rise much
more steeply - by 52%. This reflects the recovery and expansion of
industry now starting to take off after the economic difficulties
experienced following unification.

In western Germany most of the existing power station capacity will
have to be replaced by the year 2020, states Prognos, but the
consultancy finds it impossible to say at this point what the fuel
structure will be.

For example, between 2005 and 2009, nearly 6,500 MW of the total 22,500
MW nuclear capacity will have to be replaced, assuming a plant lifetime
of 30 years, followed by a further 4,800 MW between 2010-2014 and 9,900
MW between 2015-2020.

It is currently an open question whether the plant will be replaced
with nuclear power stations and if so, which options will be chosen,
says the report - for example, extending the lifetime of old plant, or
use of a new reactor type such as the EPR being developed by Siemens
and Framatome.

SPECIAL REPORT - SPANISH GAS

With the arrival of natural gas from North Africa now imminent, EER
assesses Spain's state of readiness.

The $2.6bn Maghreb-Europe pipeline is 160km away from completion,
sources at Spain's Gas Natural told EER at the end of December.

The news provided an end-1995 boost for the company, already buoyant
after the return to service of the Valle de Escombreras regasification
plant (Cartagena, Murcia) and the announcement of plans to increase its
output by a factor of 12.

Even with three regasification plants in operation this year, the
1,376km pipeline, to be operated by the EMPL venture, will be the
leading gateway for natural gas imports to Spain from the second
quarter, providing logistical support for a 24-year, take-or-pay deal
with Algerian state hydrocarbons company, Sonatrach, to import 1,439bn
thermies up to the year 2020.

Two of the four sections which make up the Algeria-Spain link are
complete: the Algerian stretch and the seabed link under the Strait of
Gibraltar. The 48-inch diameter, 520km Algerian section, laid by
Sonatrach, runs from the Hassi R' Mel gas field to the Moroccan border
via the towns of Mecheria and El Aricha.

Two parallel, 22-inch, 46km lines, which will take natural gas under
the Strait of Gibraltar, link Cape Spartel, on the Moroccan coast west
of Tangiers, and Zahara de los Atunes, on the Spanish coastline west of
Tarifa.

Pipeline company ownership

EMPL is 27%-owned by the Spanish company Sagane, in turn 91% controlled
by Madrid and 9% held by Spain's sole natural gas sourcing company,
Enagas. Portugal's Transgas owns the remaining 22% of EMPL.

Between the Algerian and Strait of Gibraltar sections, EMPL has laid
410km of the total 540km projected for the Moroccan stretch of the
pipeline. The 48-inch line will link the Moroccan border city of Ain-
Beni-Mathar to Cape Spartel, the two points in the entire pipeline
where compression stations will be sited.

The section running from Zahara de los Atunes to Cordoba, managed by
the Al Andalus company (70/30 Enagas and Transgas), has so far 240km of
the total 274km, 48-inch pipeline in place. This final section
completes what Madrid's industry and energy terms the "first phase" of
the Maghreb-Europe pipeline. Initial capacity will allow an annual
throughput of 10bncm/yr.

In practice, however, Madrid has put the initial annual volume coming
into Spain at 6bncm/yr, of which 2.5bncm/yr will go to Portugal where,
according to Gas Natural, the 371km pipeline linking Setubal and Braga
is now complete. The relationship between the two Iberian neighbours is
a key element in planned extensions to the regional natural gas
transport network in the northwestern quarter of the peninsular.

Interconnection with Portugal

The Spain-Portugal 'interconnection', as Madrid terms the plan, is
designed to allow both countries to benefit from their respective
geographies. Portugal will receive natural gas from Algeria via the gas
hub in Cordoba. By extending the northern Portuguese network,
meanwhile, Spain will be able to pipe natural gas to Galicia and
Asturias, currently without piped natural gas west of Aviles.

The new Portuguese pipeline will start in Braga going northwards across
the border to Tuy and on to Pontevedra, La Coruna, and Villalba (all
Galicia), terminating in Oviedo.

The "circuit" in western Spain will be completed by adding a pipeline
branching northwards to Asturias through Extremadura and Castilla y
Leon from the $180m trunk line link from Cordoba to Campo Maior close
to Badajoz on the Spain-Portugal border. The Cordoba-Campo Maior
pipeline is the responsibility of the Gasoducto de Extremadura company
(51% Enagas and 49% Transgas) and is made up of 192km of 32-inch
pipeline and 64km of 28-inch pipeline.

The EU's REGEN II Ecu500m finance initiative, aimed at supporting cross-
border gas and electricity links between member states, has agreed to
support the Cordoba-Campo Maior and Braga-Villalba pipeline projects to
the tune of Pta12.72bn ($103m), equal to 40% of the Pta31.8bn total
estimated spend. The Villalba-Oviedo extension is not supported by
REGEN II since it is not a border-related link, but it will receive EU
funding under the European Regional Development Fund.

In the last quarter of 1995, Madrid reaffirmed four key natural gas
infrastructural initiatives, which as part of the current (1991-2000)
national energy plan (PEN) will ensure the arrival of natural gas in
the following regions: Castilla La Mancha, Valencia, Andalucia, Murcia,
Castilla y Leon and Extremadura.

The most significant is a pipeline proposal termed the 'second phase'
of the Maghreb-Europe pipeline. It envisages 36- and 30-inch diameter
pipelines, still under study according to Gas Natural, running 320km
northeastwards from Cordoba, forking at Motilla (Castilla La Mancha
region). One branch is to run 260km northwards to Caspe, Zaragoza
province, and the other, 150km eastwards to Sagunto, on the
Mediterranean coast 30km north of Valencia.

Possible link to France?

The Caspe link is designed to open up possibilities of a connection
through Aragon or Catalonia to France. This second phase of the Maghreb-
Europe pipeline could lead to the pipe doubling its initial throughput
capacity to 20bncm/yr using the two Moroccan compression facilities.
This second phase would involve another major pipeline construction
initiative from Cordoba to northeast Spain capable of transporting
"large quantities (of natural gas) towards northern Europe", the
ministry of industry and energy said.

The other fork at Motilla would take Algerian gas to the 'Mediterranean
Arc' pipeline (Barcelona-Cartagena) at Sagunto. Both Motilla lines
would offer natural gas to areas of Castilla La Mancha, Aragon and
Valencia, currently not connected to the natural gas network.

Until the Maghreb-Europe pipeline comes into service, Spain will
continue to depend on its regasification plants to support national
demand. LNG produced some 77% of the 81.10bn thermies Enagas bought in
1994 and 84% of the 42.77bn acquired in the first half of 1995. The
reopening of the Valle de Escombreras plant at the Mediterranean port
of Cartagena, one of the modifications to the original PEN, brings the
total of regasification facilities in Spain to three, alongside those
at Palos de la Frontera (Huelva) and Barcelona.

Regasification investment

Enagas said it would invest Pta13.2bn in boosting the current
Escombreras output capacity of 50,000cm/h (equivalent to 3.5bn
thermies/yr) to 600,000cm/h in five years. The spend is part of the
regional gas plan for Murcia announced last spring, with  global
investment of Pta38bn. The company is aiming at a target of 50,000
domestic and 100 industrial customers in Murcia by the year 2000.

Enagas has divided the expansion plan into two phases. The first,
scheduled to run up to the middle of 1997 will increase emission
capacity to 150,000cm/hr, at a pressure of 72 bars using the plant's
existing storage capacity. The second phase, with two sub-stages, aims
to build two additional storage facilities holding 105,000cm each and
docking structures capable of receiving 125,000cm LNG tankers by 1998.
Enagas said the plant would reach its the final output goal of
600,000cm/h in 2000.

The opening of both the Cartagena plant and extensions to the
northwestern pipeline network have led the industry and energy ministry
to suspend the original PEN project for a new regasification plant at
the port of El Ferrol (Galicia).

Basques' separate course

Meanwhile, the autonomous Basque government is still reported to be in
negotiations with the US and Japanese gas companies, Enron and
Mitsubishi, on its proposed regasification plant for the port of
Bilbao. The plan, aimed at exclusive supply for the Basque region has
been costed at Pta28bn in the region's budget for 1996. None of this
will come from Madrid, which has emphasised the plan's exclusion from
PEN.

Only one other gas aim from the 1991 PEN proposals has yet to be
carried out: a 100km pipe-line connecting Aranda del Duero and
Valladolid.

Approved additions to PEN are: a 570km pipeline linking Almendralejo
(Extremadura) and Oviedo (Asturias) with a compression station;
extending the Aranda-Valladolid line to a junction with the
Almendralejo-Oviedo link at Zamora; and increasing the diameter of the
planned 220km pipeline linking Valencia, Orihela and Cartagena from 20
to 30 inches. Enagas has said it is studying a further 175km extension
to this pipeline to Almeria, which would cost an estimated Pta10.32bn.

Also in Andalucia, Gas Natural said last November that infrastructural
investment in the region would top Pta120bn by the year 2000. This sum
includes laying the Andalucian section of the Maghreb-Europe pipeline,
the Cordoba-Jaen-Granada pipeline and pipelines to take Algerian gas to
Cadiz, Malaga, Jerez de la Frontera and Campo de Gibraltar.

It also includes work carried out at the docking facilities at the
Palos de la Frontera regasification plant. Gas Natural expects
Andalucia to consume 12.8bn thermies/yr after 2005.

Power utility Sevillana has meanwhile awarded a Pta2bn contract to the
industrial group Babcock Wilcox to convert the 540 MW second generating
group of the company's Bahia de Algeciras power station to gas.

SWEDISH ENERGY COMMISSION REPORT ON NUCLEAR PHASE-OUT

One of Sweden's 12 nuclear reactors can be closed before the next
general elections in 1998, but all 12 cannot be phased out before 2010.
This is the somewhat unsurprising conclusion of the national energy
commission that has been studying the matter.

That Sweden can manage on 11 reactors is proven by the fact that
Sweden's oldest reactor, the 400 MW Oskarshamn 1, has been standing
idle for over three years. But on the very same day that the commission
published its report, the Swedish nuclear inspectorate gave Sydkraft
the go-ahead to restart the reactor.

The energy commission has not fulfilled its stated task of solving
Sweden's nuclear power problems once and for all, but it has produced
600 pages of background material for political bargaining on how to
fulfil the parliamentary decision from 1980 to phase out nuclear power.

Political commentator Anders Isaksson called the energy commission's
document "another meaningless report in an over-studied question, a
politically bespoke tailoring that has been run from the government,
whose conclusions are based on - for the moment - politically correct
assumptions."

The last part of Isaksson's comment refers to the fact that, just a few
weeks ago, the commission majority believed that two reactors could be
closed by 1998. The change has been explained by the assumption that
the government wanted space to negotiate.

Political make-up

The political majority of the commission is constituted by the
Christian Democratic Party, the Liberals and the ruling Social
Democratic party. The conservative party is openly pro-nuclear these
days, while the environmentalists and the leftists are too anti-nuclear
for the agreement.

The government also wants the Centre Party to join the agreement, but
there will be a price to pay. The Centre is an anti-nuclear, pro-
biomass farmer's party with a long-standing environmental reputation to
defend. It does, however, accept slightly increased use of natural gas
to make up for the loss of energy production when nuclear power plants
are closed, but the party does not want to abolish 2010 as the final
year for nuclear, and wants to phase out two - not one - reactors
before 1998.

The real negotiations are expected to start in March, when the Social
Democrats will elect a new leader to follow outgoing premier Ingvar
Carlsson.

The only candidate - finance minister Goeran Persson - has declared
that he has the same views on energy as the current premier, which
means respecting the 1980 referendum decision to phase out all nuclear
power by 2010 without harnessing more hydro resources, while keeping
CO2 emissions at the 1990 level and maintaining internationally
competitive electricity prices.

Persson says it will be hard to meet these goals. But all his promises
are currently being viewed with doubt, since he was still steadfastly
denying that he would stand as party leader only hours before he
officially accepted the offer from the election committee.

Half nuclear, half hydro

Sweden currently uses 140 TWh/yr of electricity, of which half is
nuclear, half hydro. The energy commission contends that Sweden will
need 159 TWh electricity by 2010, and that 15 TWh of the requirement
can be reduced by energy efficiency, while another 10 TWh can be
covered by conversion to other forms of energy.

Hydro power is projected to account for 64 TWh, roughly the same as
today. Current wind power, cogeneration in industry and district
heating will yield 13 TWh. New wind power and cogeneration plants could
provide 11 TWh, which leaves 46 TWh of the electricity requirement
still to be covered.

Energy minister Joergen Andersson says that natural gas could provide
12-30 TWh of electricity and new hydro sources 27 TWh if all streams
and rivers were harnessed, which he himself does not believe to be a
realistic possibility.

The commission does not see natural gas as a large-scale alternative,
and believes that if the gas network is to be expanded from Gothenburg,
where it ends today, to Stockholm and on to Finland, it will be because
other nations have interest in the gas - either to sell Russian or
Norwegian gas or to consume it. In fact, Gazprom has offered to build a
grid through Sweden, which is seen as a means of securing an
alternative route for Russian gas to the European market. Sweden only
uses about 9 TWh/yr of natural gas.

It will cost some SKr70-90bn ($10.6-13.6bn) to replace nuclear power
with natural gas-fired plants, and possibly twice as much if biomass is
chosen as a fuel, according to the energy commission, which believes
that electricity prices can increase to an acceptable level if the
phase-out is allowed to be a slow process.

The free market for electricity introduced from the start of 1996 will
keep prices down, according to the commission. The high voltage price
in Sweden currently is SKr0.20/kWh, while electricity from new natural
gas-fired plants would cost Skr0.25-0.30/kWh and from biomass over
SKr0.40/kWh.

Three phase-out guidelines

The commission has set out three main possible guidelines for the phase-
out:

* 1) a law that would prohibit nuclear power. This could mean paying
compensation to the power utilities and tough negotiations. The
utilities claim they have a right to total compensation and insist that
it should be in the form of new production facilities.

* 2) taxation of nuclear power plants. The tax should increase with the
age of the reactor. This would make nuclear power less competitive
since the owners also need to invest in maintenance of the plants.

* 3) subsidies to energy sources that are favourable for climatic and
environmental reasons.

A cold snap over the Christmas holiday season served to help
concentrate minds on the matter of electricity supply. Some 24,000 MW
was needed each day between Christmas and New Year, 4,000 MW more than
usual at this time of the year. Sweden's total capacity is over 33,000
MW, but grid problems reduce the available capacity to 29,000 MW.

The nuclear inspectorate has meanwhile given permission to restart
Sweden's oldest nuclear reactor Oskarshamn 1, after over three years of
standstill.

Problems at Oskarshamn

The inspectorate ordered the closure of Oskarshamn 1 and four other
reactors in September 1992 after a near-accident with the emergency
cooling water system in the Barsebaeck 2 reactor. While repairs were
being made other deficiencies were found and Oskarshamn 1 was given a
total renovation. Only the reactor tank has not been altered. The
reactor was started in 1972.

Oskarshamn 1 has been given a provisional permit until summer, when the
inspectorate will decide on prolonging the permit, at most until the
summer of 1999.

The renovation of the reactor is something of a model for the demands
on other reactors when they grow older, according to the inspectorate.
New methods for analysis have shown the weakness in some of the older
constructions, e.g. safety systems against fires and flooding should be
improved. The utilities' ambitions for improvements have not been high
enough in earlier plans, says the inspectorate.

* Meanwhile, a trade union dispute is taking place at the four reactors
in Oskarshamn. Electricians have refused to be undergo drug tests for
alcohol and narcotics: other unions have agreed to random checks, but
the electricians do not believe them necessary for safety reasons.
There was no problem in starting tests at the Ringhals nuclear plant.
The tests were introduced after a woman was killed: her brother was
suspected of committing the crime and had worked at the nuclear plant,
although he had previous convictions for narcotics crime and illegal
possession of weapons.

FORMER EDF HEAD AVOIDS OIL JOB

Former Electricite de France (EdF) president Gilles Menage has
successfully resisted the presidency of the Institut francais du
petrole, which was being offered to him as a consolation prize for his
sacking. Menage did not have any obvious qualification to head the
research body, and did not want the post. Indeed, the institute, which
brings together the French oil companies Elf and Total, as well as Gaz
de France and the motor manufacturers Peugeot/Citroen and Renault, will
be better off with Pierre Jacquard, who has spent over 25 years in
house. Jacquard, who has been general manager since 1988, was elected
unanimously to be both president and general manager. His election
marks an effort by the institute to become more independent of the

BAVARIAN/CZECH OIL LINK ON LINE

A 340km oil pipeline from Ingolstadt in southern Germany to the Czech
Republic has just come on stream. The joint Bavarian/Czech venture will
become fully operational in April this year. The DM725m ($503m)
project, dubbed 'Mero', is to help towards making the Czech Republic
independent of Russian crude. It will transport up to 15mt/yr of crude
from Western to Eastern Europe. Mero is the first oil pipeline linking
Germany with a central European country. At the same time, the
construction of a 600,000cm oil storage facility near Prague was
concluded.

to gain market share before the expected arrival of major multinational
oil companies. Via its 50%-owned distributor Slomin Holding Druzba (EER
427/10), OMV last year combined its retail activities in northern
Italy, Slovenia and Croatia. From a starting base of 79 filling
stations, the Slomin Holding outlets have expanded to 94, with the
newest station opened in Maribor, Slovenia, last month. Slomin Holding
last year retailed 560,000t of mineral oil products, with 1995 sales
topping Sch2bn ($197m), a gain of 13.2% over 1994 on a 4.5% increase in
product volume in tonnes. Investments totalling Sch422m are planned for
1996.

WINTER WEATHER EXPOSES BG TO CRITICS

British Gas (BG) admitted it had been "caught out" by the severity of
the UK's Christmas weather and had been unable to fulfil its commitment
to all its customers with service contracts. Thousands of people with
'Three Star' contracts were reportedly left without heating during the
holiday period - some for several days - after engineers failed to turn
up to repair central heating faults. Under the "peace of mind" service
scheme, customers are promised that a gas engineer will be despatched
within 24 hours of the problem being reported. Spokesman Andrew Davis
said: "In some areas we were caught out . . . We will look at what
happened to make sure that we learn from this next year." He said that
conditions were so extreme in Glasgow, for example, that the diesel
fuel in service vans froze.

GERMAN MINI-CHP INTEREST BOOMS

Although supplying only a niche market, small unit-type CHP stations
are becoming ever more popular, according to the results of a survey by
the German utilities' association, VDEW. By the end of 1994, 1,577 of
the mini-CHP plants, owned by industry and municipalities, were in
operation, some 37% more than in 1992. A further 75 were under
construction and 33 planned. Almost 90% of the plant had an electricity
generating capacity of under 1 MW. By end-1994, total capacity had
risen to 872 MWe compared with 577 MWe two years previously.

CALIFORNIA BACKPEDAL
Air Resources Board Favoring Five-Year Delay in ZEV Mandates
In Accord with the Voluntary System Proposed by Automakers

Watch for a delay in zero-emission vehicle sales mandates in
California with two percent in 1998 effectively replaced by
10 percent -- in 2003.
     CARB has ordered its staff to develop a scheme to
replace the original 1998 deadline for meeting a 2-percent
ZEV sales mandate.
     CARB will instead float a plan to have automakers meet
a 10-percent ZEV sales mandate by 2003.
     This approach, to be formally proposed by March,
effectively gives automakers a five-year breather before
meeting ZEV sales goals.
     But the plan will also encourage ZEV introductions as
early as this year, by giving automakers credits, toward the
2003 mandate, for ZEVs brought to market before 1998.
Credits will also be given to ZEVs that use advanced battery
designs.
     Automakers, for their part, pledge to have capacity in
place to make 5,000 EVs in 1996 and 1997, and 14,000 per
year from 1998 until 2003's 10-percent mandate kicks in
(figures spread over the "Big Seven" -- Chrysler, Ford and
General Motors; and Honda, Mazda, Nissan and Toyota).

FEDERAL MILLIONS
ARPA Largesse Expected for Electric Pickup;
$5mm Project by Composite Firm, Partners

Developers of a composite-bodied electric pickup
truck will match expected government funding of
$2.5 million, making for a $5-million overall
effort, says Kerry Hitt, president of Advanced
Composite Products, of Harrisburg, Pa., lead
designer of the vehicle.
     ACP is a composite race car developer. The
new truck is known as the UEV, for utility
electric vehicle.
     Hitt and his partners, including Pennsylvania
Power & Light and other utilities coordinated by
the Pennsylvania Electric Transportation Council
(PETC) now await the formal award of money from
the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency.

Westinghouse Drive

     The prototype UEV includes an electric drive
train from Maryland's Westinghouse.
     ACP plans to build three or four UEVs for
crash testing, hoping to take a crash-certified
final design to an OEM -- "preferably a
Pennsylvania OEM," says Hitt -- for volume
production.
     The UEV chassis is formed by a rectangular
tube structural member which also serves as the
battery storage area. "The reinforcements used in
the chassis area include carbon fiber, chosen for
its structural properties, and glass fiber,
selected for structural and dielectric
properties," ACP says.
     Other composite EV developers, says Hitt,
have "merely substituted materials," using
composites instead of metals. "We have designed
our vehicle around composite materials, around
what they are and what they do," he told F&F.

Shown in Atlanta

     ACP's competitive edge is highly accurate and
consistent fiber orientation, Hitt says. The
company will employ a proprietary fabrication
process, including resin transfer molding, to
build the UEV. The RTM-based process, which
involves dry fiber preforms that approximate the
shape of finished parts, "will cut labor intensity
by up to 80 percent." The UEV design employs epoxy
resins to consolidate the high-strength fibers and
includes both foam and honeycomb core materials.
     The prototype UEV was shown at December's
electric vehicle infrastructure meeting in
Atlanta.

ON LINE AND FOR SALE
Westinghouse Launches Manufacturing
Of EV Drives, Controllers and Chargers

Westinghouse says it's begun series production of
electric vehicle drive trains and related
components, including chargers.
     The company makes 100- and 230-horsepower EV
drives. It numbers Georgia's Blue Bird and China's
Yuanwang Bus Group among its customers for the
larger system, and Ford and Chrysler, for Ranger
pickups and the new Epic minivan (F&F, October 30;
also Chrysler-Epic story on following page of this
issue) for the 100-horsepower system.
     The Chrysler and Ford vehicles will also
employ a 6.0-kilowatt Westinghouse onboard
charger.
     Westinghouse also offers a 135-kilowatt rapid
charge system that uses knowhow from Georgia's
Electronic Power Technology, Inc. (EPTI).
     "Existing prototype systems can recharge
large transit-style electric buses to 80 percent
of capacity in under one hour," Westinghouse says.
     EV component business is organizationally
part of the Westinghouse defense and electronics
businesses that were put up for sale following the
corporation's acquisition of the CBS television
network.

POWER CONTROL
More Federal Support for SatCon:
EV Power Controllers and Flywheels

SatCon Technology Corporation has new federal
support for its ongoing efforts to perfect power
control and flywheel energy storage technology.
New funding is coming from the Advanced Research
Projects Agency and via the ARPA-supported
Electricore, the Mid-America Electric Vehicle
Consortium.
     Massachusetts-based SatCon has a Phase I ARPA
contract valued at $100,000 to develop next-
generation modular power controllers for electric
drives and some $200,000 from Electricore for
power management and flywheel-based storage
system.
Leveraging Other Projects
     The Electricore contract carries a total
cost-shared value of $427,000, as SatCon can apply
matching funds of as much as $227,000 from other
development projects.
     Thermal management is the key to SatCon's
power controllers. SatCon has "developed ways to
densely compact these modules and take the heat
out," spokesman Bill O'Donnell told F&F, partly
through the use of advanced materials but also via
proprietary engineering approaches.

IT'S EPIC, BUT WHEN?
Everything But the Release Date
As Chrysler Promotes Fleet Van

"It's aimed at the fleet market," says Chrysler,
and what's more represents "the next logical step
in the development of electric vehicles." The
automaker said at last month's EV infrastructure
meeting in Atlanta that it is ready to build the
Electric Powered Interurban Commuter -- the Epic
-- minivan in Canada, with California a prime
market target.
     But the timetable is a secret.

'Supplier Issues'

     "There are several final supplier issues that
need to be worked through, so we're not ready to
give an exact launch date," Chrysler electric
minivan program executive engineer Bob Feldmaier
said in a statement in Atlanta. But "we've made it
clear," Feldmeier said, "that this vehicle would
be available by the 1998 model year, and that has
not changed."
     Demand is a key factor in establishing a
specific launch date, Chrysler says. "Cost and
range are the two critical market issues that will
shape fleet customer demand," the automaker added.
It is predicting a modest per-charge range of
about 60 miles for the vehicle under "ideal
conditions." The company also says that its
onboard charger will require as much as eight
hours for a complete "fill-up."

Horizon Batteries, Westinghouse Drive

     Chrysler has confirmed that it will use the
lightweight Horizon lead acid battery from
Electrosource in the Epic van, and elsewhere at
the Atlanta gathering endorsed an onboard
conductive charging system that would allow an
electric vehicle to be plugged in for charging
almost anywhere. The new EV is also to employ a
Westinghouse drive train, with a 100 peak-
horsepower AC induction motor, and have a 6.0-
kilowatt Westinghouse charger.
     Chrysler says it's ready to build the Epic
van at its Windsor, Ont. assembly plant "as part
of regular production. No conversion is
necessary." The EPIC model designation will be
applied to both Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager
EV models.
     "Because the minivan is by far our most
successful vehicle, and because it has the unique
ability to work as either a commuter vehicle or a
utility vehicle, this platform made the most sense
to us for electric power," Feldmaier said in
Atlanta.
     "The large flat floor also gives us plenty of
room to store batteries, and more importantly, to
change battery types as new technologies are
developed.
     "Right now we're able to get 27 modules at
about 1,600 pounds onboard of the advanced
[Electrosource Horizon] lead-acid battery. We
anticipate a range of about 60 miles under ideal
conditions with that amount and type of battery."
     The cost and price of the vehicle have also
not been finalized, although Chrysler warns that
"the low-volume componentry and the cost of
batteries" will make the vehicle "significantly
more costly than a comparable gasoline minivan."
Pricing will not be announced until the release
date of the vehicle has been established.
     Chrysler says it will target fleet and
utility customers that have previously purchased
its electric and compressed natural gas vehicles.
     The front-wheel drive Epic van will have a
gross weight of 5,900 pounds with 27 kilowatt-
hours of power, enough for 60 miles without
accessories (the vehicle will include power brakes
and power steering, an AM-FM radio and heat pump
air conditioning and auxiliary electric heating
system, and a rear defrost).
     The Epic minivan will also have a battery
management system and an onboard charging system.

CHARGER SPLIT
Ford, Chrysler Differ with GM
On Conductive Versus Inductive

Detroit's Big Three have another reason to say
that electric vehicles aren't yet ready for market
-- Chrysler and Ford have endorsed direct metal
contact conductive charging couplers while General
Motors prefers the Hughes-developed inductive
paddle connector now marketed by Delco.
     Ford and Chrysler unveiled a prototype metal-
to-metal connector in Atlanta, and said they were
giving meeting participants "a look into the
future."

GM Inductive Deal with Toyota

     GM, meanwhile, has notched an agreement
whereby Toyota gets a license, including
manufacturing rights, to the Delco paddle coupler.
     Ford and Chrysler say they've taken a step
toward needed standardization in the EV industry.
"With EV infrastructure, the goal is to avoid the
VHS versus Beta problems we saw with early video
tape technology," Ford EV program director John
Wallace said in a joint statement.
     "We believe conductive charging is safe and
the most efficient and cost-effective method of
charging," said Chrysler executive engineer Bob
Davis.
     The prototype unveiled in Atlanta was
produced by SCI Systems, described as "the world's
largest contract manufacturer of electronic
assemblies and products." The design, which is to
available to other charger and coupler
manufacturers, is said to have been made to the
specifications of Chrysler and Ford, "five other
major auto manufacturers," the California Air
Resources Board and the Infrastructure Working
Council sponsored by the Electric Power Research
Institute.
     GM-Delco, for its part, claims the support
not only of Chrysler and Ford but of Honda, Mazda,
Nissan and Toyota behind the issuance of a
Recommended Practice for Electric Vehicle
Inductive Charging via the Society of Automotive
Engineers a year ago (F&F, February 6, 1995).

'No Plug-and-Socket'

     "Inductive charging is known for its safety
features and simple operation," says a Delco
release. "The inductive charger has no
conventional metal plug-and-socket connection.
Instead, the user inserts a lightweight,
waterproof plastic paddle into a vehicle's charge
port. This simple action transfers power through a
magnetic field."
     Ford and Chrysler say that their coupler is
safe in all weathers, too.

VOLUME BATTERIES IN FRANCE
It's an Industry Now, Say the French,
As Saft Sets Up Bordeaux Battery Plant

Saft has inaugurated "the world's first plant to
produce electric vehicle batteries in volume" at
Bordeaux in southwest France.
     The big customers for the company's nickel
cadmium batteries are the French automakers PSA
and Renault for the Citroen AX, the Peugeot 106,
and Renault's Clio and Express EVs.
     The $20-million plant will be able to produce
batteries for 5,000 vehicles per year. "Extensions
are planned to meet market growth," says a release
from Saft America (Valdosta, Ga.).
     The French car companies and Saft have had an
agreement on ni-cads since 1992. Saft claims a
service life of 60,000 miles for the advanced
batteries.
     "Ongoing research is focused on nickel-based
batteries for current generation electric vehicles
and lithium-based batteries for vehicles in the
next century," Saft says. "Incremental increases
in battery capability are planned to increase
vehicle range to two-and-a-half times what it is
today."

PSA Peugeot Citroen may be plotting a return to
the U.S. market, according to remarks by chairman
Jacques Calvet reported in The Wall Street
Journal. "He said Peugeot would consider such a
move only if there was a niche his company could
fill," the Journal said on December 19. "[Calvet]
declined to say whether that niche could be an
electric car."

VOLUME BATTERIES IN TEXAS
$80 Million Seen as Potential Value
To Electrosource of Chrysler Order

An order by Chrysler for its Epic electric minivan
will allow Electrosource to ramp up to full OEM
supplier status, the Austin, Texas-based supplier
of Horizon brand lightweight lead-acid batteries
said in Atlanta.
     The Production Purchase Order could lead to
business exceeding a cumulative $80 million over
the next three years, Electrosource says. The
Chrysler PPO also provides cost and delivery terms
for Horizon battery packs for the Epic van. The
first of an expected series of build orders has
already been filled.
     The Horizon battery saves weight by using a
lead-plated glass fiber mesh in lieu of lead
plates. Electrosource claims "the highest peak
power of any battery technology currently
available," noting that independent testing has
pegged specific energy at 44.2 watt-hours per
kilogram, about 50 percent better than that of
traditional lead-acid batteries.

Quick-Charge Capable

     And, "with proper equipment, the Horizon
battery can be recharged as quickly as 30 minutes,
which effectively extends the vehicle's range,"
the company says. Chrysler is believed to favor
the Norvik quick-charge system, though slow-charge
will be standard for the first of the Epic vans.
     "Electrosource has met all of the technical
requirements to qualify the advanced Horizon
battery for use in our electric minivans," Bob
Feldmaier, a Chrysler executive engineer in charge
of the electric minivan program, said in the
Electrosource release.
     "Electrosource's technical staff has helped
our program improve performance by contributing
insights into battery management systems and
advanced charging profiles," Feldmaier said.

NEWT GINGRICH TO THE RESCUE?
Clinton Administration Ducks the LNG Excise Tax Issue
So the NGV and Gas Industry Takes its Case to Congress

It's falling to Congress to save vehicle users of LNG from
taxes that make the clean-burning fuel more expensive than
diesel. The Clinton administration has refused to go to bat
for the NGV industry following an adverse 1995 excise tax
ruling by the Internal Revenue Service (F&F, October 16).
     The American Gas Association and its affiliated Natural
Gas Vehicle Coalition are actively working the problem --
not via the President, as had been planned, but through
Congress.
     "Clinton doesn't want to take on the IRS," says one
industry observer in Washington. And, he says, the overall
government goal of deficit reduction looms as a major
obstacle to reversing the ruling. "The Treasury is not
interested in finding new ways to decrease revenues. The
Treasury wants to tax anything it can get its hands on."
     The NGV advocates' sole ace? Clean-burning LNG would
allow truckers to meet 2004 standards for emissions now, and
the transportation industry could arguably could save money
by doing so if the tax were readjusted.

INSIDE TRACK
EDO Gets a Leg Up with Japanese OEMs
As Fiber Supplier Toray, Sumitomo Buy In

Composite CNG tankmaker EDO Canada has snatched a
major marketing advantage with the huge Japanese
auto sector. The company has notched a deal
making Sumitomo the exclusive distributor of
EDO's LiteRider brand tanks to Japanese OEMs,
worldwide.
     In return, for an aggregate $5,000,000
Canadian (some $3.6 million U.S. at current rates
of exchange), two Sumitomo units and EDO's carbon
fiber-supplier Toray Industries have taken a
combined 16.4-percent stake in EDO's compressed
natural gas cylinder manufacturing operation in
Calgary.

EDO Still Holds the Majority

     The deal modifies the EDO Corporation-
Province of Alberta 60-40 joint-venture ownership
of EDO Canada to give Sumitomo 6.6 percent and
Toray 9.8 percent of the company. New York City-
based EDO Corporation retains the majority share.
     EDO Canada makes LiteRider brand CNG tanks
in Calgary, using polyethylene liners overwrapped
with carbon fiber. Its principal fiber supplier
has been Toray for high-strength T-700 material,
although EDO is working with at least one other
manufacturer, believed to be Hercules.
     [Toray is distinguished in the materials
world as the supplier of toughened epoxy
composite material, made with T-800 carbon fiber,
for the tail and floorbeams of Boeing
Commercial's new 777 widebody jet. The 'triple-7'
is the first American transport aircraft to be
built with composite primary structures.]

Japanese in U.S. the 'First Target'

     The initial EDO Canada deal with Sumitomo
makes Japan's Sumitomo Corporation's Osaka
Machinery Department and New York City's Sumitomo
Corporation of America the exclusive distributors
of LiteRider cylinders to Japanese automotive
manufacturers. Those with car or truck
manufacturing operations in the United States
"are the first target," says EDO Corporation
president Frank Fariello.
     Honda, for example, is promising a natural
gas-powered car for the 1998 model year. And
although the vehicle is to be built in Ohio,
component decisions are expected to be made in
Japan.
     [Prototype Honda NGVs use a two-tank
configuration using all-composite cylinders from
Lincoln Composites. Honda has indicated that it
will shift to one larger cylinder for the
production vehicle.]
     EDO may eventually grant LiteRider
manufacturing rights to its Japanese partners,
although according to Fariello, the establishment
of an NGV industry in Japan awaits regulatory
changes and the building of a fueling
infrastructure there.
     Japanese LiteRider manufacture "is not part
of this deal," the EDO chief told F&F. "That is
subject to additional negotiations."
     "At this time there are no plans for
Sumitomo to manufacture the CNG cylinders in
Japan," says a Sumitomo spokeswoman in New York.
"However, we are leaving our options open for the
future."

A Tank Technical Task Force Too

     The latest arrangement, publicized last
month, establishes a strategic alliance between
EDO, Sumitomo and Toray designed to "accelerate
and expand the alliance's presence in the U.S.
and international NGV market."
     The two Japanese firms get an EDO Canada
board seat. The Toray deal further

 --> sets up an EDO-Toray technical task force
aimed at improving composite CNG tanks with the
primary thrust of "increasing the overall cost-
effectiveness of NGV fuel storage;" and

 --> maintains Sumitomo as the sole distributor of
LiteRider cylinders to Japanese OEMs worldwide.
     "For years, the principal applications of
carbon fiber have been in the aerospace and
sporting goods industries," Toray Advanced
Composites GM Kichi Fujisawa said in an EDO
release.
     The LiteRider cylinder, Fujisawa said,
"presents us with an opportunity to expand these
applications."
     Fujisawa is now a director of EDO Canada.

LNG at LAX
RFP in Preparation for Permanent Station

The Los Angeles International Airport board has
authorized LAX to float a request for proposals
for a permanent liquefied and compressed natural
gas fueling station in support of LAX vehicles.
     The turnkey LNG/CNG fueling station on
airport property near the intersection of
Imperial Highway and Main Street will also be
available to airport and other fleet operators,
and to the public.
     LAX has 14 LNG-powered shuttle buses, with
eight more expected for delivery beginning in
January 1996. The Airports department also
operates 33 CNG-powered utility trucks, pickup
trucks and sedans.
     LNG fuel for the LAX buses is currently
supplied by a temporary station. CNG comes from a
Southern California Gas station on United
Airlines' leasehold.
     The new station "will help the department
meet California's State Implementation Plan as it
applies to civil airports, which is expected to
mirror the federal plan that calls for a major
shift to low-emission vehicles," said executive
director John Driscoll.

FIRST-EVER REBATE
Payment to New York, New Jersey Port
For Three New Vans and a Conversion

New Jersey's Public Service Electric & Gas has
determined its first natural gas vehicle rebate,
a payment of $1,000 per vehicle for four NGVs
placed in service by the Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey.
     The Port has bought three new Chrysler NGV
minivans and converted an existing jeep to
natural gas fuel. "The Port Authority's move to
natural gas vehicles is a good business decision
that will eventually save us money by cutting
maintenance and fuel costs," says Port project
manager Sal D'Angelo. The Port will put more NGVs
in service this year.
     The Port uses New Jersey's first public-
access CNG station, a facility put in service
near the Holland Tunnel to New York City as a
joint venture of PSE&G and Shell (F&F, May 15,
1995).
     The PSE&G rebate will be available through
August 1997.

HEAVY HALF DOZEN?
Big Rigs May Make Big Year for LNG
Half a Dozen Truckmakers Offer NGVs

The current excise tax situation has made for
uncertainty (see page 1), but big-rig trucks
represent one alternative fuel vehicle market
that may not be dependent on forced fleet buys or
fuel subsidies, as operators eye economic
advantages to clean-burning liquefied natural gas
fuel.
     Nigh-on half a dozen U.S. manufacturers are
expected to offer dedicated natural gas-powered
medium- and heavy-duty trucks for model year
1996.
     They include Volvo GM, Freightliner, the
affiliates Kenworth and Peterbilt, and possibly
Navistar. The vehicles will be outfitted with
natural gas engines from Navistar, Cummins and
Detroit Diesel.

'Products that Have Been Missing'

     "These new vehicles will give customers the
natural gas products that have been missing from
our portfolio and will play a pivotal role in
boosting NGV industry efforts to more
aggressively target high-fuel-use, medium- and
heavy-duty markets," said Gas Research Institute
product manager Dan Kincaid.
     "The availability of OEM-produced trucks is
a significant development for GRI and the gas
industry, which has cofunded development of NGV
engines," Kincaid said in a GRI statement.
     But "Vehicle manufacturers believe the
success of these trucks will depend on definitive
legislation, customer demand, cost acceptance and
fueling infrastructure," the GRI man cautioned.

NAVISTAR
Navistar, for one, says it's too early to promise
NGVs or natural gas engines for 1996 due to an
absence of federal standards on fuel systems,
particularly for liquefied natural gas. The
Chicago-based company has worked with Detroit
Diesel on modification of Navistar's T444E engine
for natural gas, but says its Class 6-7 Model
4700 truck with a T444NG powerplant isn't quite
ready for market. "Right now it's only available
with the T444E clean diesel," says a Navistar
spokesman. "We take a very conservative
approach," says another company source.
     The T444 is available for natural gas
operation through DDC as the 30G engine.
     [Navistar is also working with other
alternative fuels, including dimethyl ether,
which has been tested in a T444E engine and
according to Navistar "can eliminate exhaust
smoke and greatly reduce other exhaust pollutants
while reducing engine noise. Navistar is working
DME with Amoco and with Haldor Topsoe of Denmark
and AVL List of Germany. Topsoe has a process for
making DME from natural gas, coal, or renewables,
Navistar says.]

KENWORTH
Kenworth Truck Company (Kirkland, Wash.) has the
Class 8 Model T800 and the Class 7 prototype T300
configured for LNG operation. "After the first of
the year is when we really expect to make an
introduction," says Kenworth's Evan Campbell.

VOLVO GM
Greensboro, N.C.-based Volvo GM Heavy Truck is
offering a refuse hauler, the "Xpeditor," with a
Cummins L10-300G natural gas engine available in
LNG and CNG versions. The NGV Xpeditor was
unveiled in mid-1995 making "Volvo GM Heavy Truck
the first Class 8 truck manufacturer to offer
natural gas engines as a factory option."
Volvo GM, Dave Schrader, 910-393-2847; fax 393-

FREIGHTLINER
Freightliner Corporation of Portland, Ore. also
unveiled a natural gas-powered vehicle in mid-
1995: the FL 60 business class truck with a
Cummins B5.9G (5.9-liter) engine.
     The company now offers an even wider range
of LNG-powered trucks, including the Class 5
FL50, the Class 7 FL70, and the Class 8 FL106,
FLD112, FLD112SD, FLD120, and FLD120SD models.
     Engine options include the Cummins B5.9G and
L10G and the 50G and 60G from Detroit Diesel.
     Freightliner Custom Chassis (Gaffney, S.C.)
offers the Class 3 Model MT-12FNG with a Hercules
3.7-liter or Cummins B5.9G engine.
     The MT-12FNG is designed for the postal
service, which according to GRI may buy as many
as 500 of the CNG-powered units this fiscal year.
Freightliner, Bill Thomas, 503-735-8896
Freightliner Custom Chassis, 803-488-8604

CUMMINS
Besides the well known L10G and B5.9G, Cummins
late last year promoted its first 8.9-liter
natural gas-fueled engine, the C8.3G, with
availability this first quarter of 1996. The 250-
horsepower C8.3G is available with torque ratings
of 660 and 750 pound-feet at 1,400 rpm. The six-
cylinder engine is aimed at bus and truck
markets.

CLEAN FUEL CORRIDOR
Diverse Groups Team in California
For Clean Vehicle Fueling Facilities

A California consortium is claiming to be the
first in the nation to offer private motorists a
Clean Fuels Corridor stretching across two big
southern counties: San Bernadino and Riverside.
     Fuels covered at 15 sites include CNG and
LNG, as well as electric vehicle charging.
     New natural gas fueling sites in Ontario,
Riverside, Temecula and Joshua Tree will
supplement some 77 CNG sites, about half of them
public, currently in service in Southern
California.
     Consortium members include Southern
California Gas, Southern California Edison,
United Parcel Service and local governments.
     The project has just under $750,000 in
vehicle registration funds and nearly $1.2
million from private parties including consortium
members, Applied LNG Technologies, Mesa Pacific,
Amendt Oil and Lapis Energy.

Ford has turned out the first two prototype
Ranger pickup gliders from its assembly line in
Edison, N.J. "The purpose of building these
prototypes was to learn how to move a glider most
efficiently through an assembly plant without
disrupting normal production," Ford EV marketing

Worldwide Conversions is building a plant in
Kansas for the installation of electric drives in
the trucks (F&F, October 30). TDM is shooting for
Qualified Vehicle Modifier status, meaning that
Ford will warranty EV trucks from the Kansas
plant. TDM has not yet gotten the QVM nod because
"until that plant is built, Ford can't audit it,"
says TDM project manager Bill Coppola. He notes
that TDM has already secured QVM status for Ford

SunShine gets FERC nod to enter Florida market

     SunShine Interstate Transmission has received FERC's blessing
to build a 145-mile natural gas pipeline into Florida that will
interconnect with a proposed 570-mile intrastate pipeline to be
built by its affiliate.
     The commission also approved the pipeline's levelized rates. The
rates are based on the ultimate capacity of the project, even though
it will be at only half of its proposed capacity for three years. Since
the pipeline will be charging only the base rate, the lack of
capacity for the first few years will result in under-recovery of its
levelized cost of service. FERC will allow SunShine to spread the
recovery of the under-recovered costs over the life of the project.
     This rate design will provide new pipelines with the opportunity
to compete with already established pipelines, Commissioner
Donald Santa said. "It's a way to avoid the potentially time-
consuming debate on whether future expansion costs should be
rolled-in or incremental," he added.
     The pipeline will serve customers on the Florida peninsula, an
area that  has only one established interstate pipeline, Florida Gas
Transmission. The increased competition will benefit the Florida
consumers, Commissioner James Hoecker added.

NGSA says power study skims over gas benefits

     The Natural Gas Supply Assn. (NGSA) has challenged the
findings in a report by a coal industry-backed group that finds coal
as the fuel of choice for the next century's new baseload electricity
generation.
     The study "fails to factor in the full costs of technologies that
would make coal's exhaust stream as clean as gas exhaust and
assumes that the current bias in environmental regulations will
continue to permit higher pollution levels from coal than from gas,"
said Bruce Craig, NGSA's director of environmental affairs.
     Energy Ventures Analysis prepared the study, "Fuel Choice for
New Electric Generating Capacity in the Next Century: Coal or
Natural Gas," for the Center for Energy and Economic Development,
a coalition of coal companies and railroads. The report finds that
while natural gas-based technologies are the economical choice for
new peaking load power plant capacity, coal is the cost-effective
fuel of choice for baseload capacity units, says a recent study by
Energy Ventures Analysis.
     The report determines that natural gas technologies have lower
capital and nonfuel operating costs than coal technologies, but coal-
based technologies "offer a significant delivered fuel price
advantage over its natural gas-based competitors to virtually any
power plant location." For baseload units, fuel costs are the largest
element of operating costs, making coal the most cost-effective fuel
of choice, the study says.
     Craig countered, "There's no need to make 'either-or' judgements
about fueling future electricity generation. Gas, oil and coal will all
play an important role." He added that the energy industry should
focus on policies that create market incentives for higher
efficiency, environmental stewardship and new technologies to keep
this country competitive.
     The overall goal, Craig said, should be that consumers get the
best package of fuel, jobs and environmental benefits at the lowest
cost.
     The study says one reason coal is less expensive is because its
domestic supply is greater than the natural gas supply. At current
rates of consumption, the United States has about a 250-year
supply of recoverable coal reserves, which can be commercially
developed at current price levels, Energy Ventures Analysis
determines. For natural gas, reserves are more limited, possibly a
50-year supply, and are increasingly costly to develop, the study
says.
     However, NGSA said the study underestimates natural gas
reserves and fails to factor in the growing trend toward competition
in the electricity market.
     "The study inappropriately assumes that those working in the
electric generating field do not read market signals correctly and
do not use fuel supply, technology or market instruments that other
industries use," Craig noted.
     For an abstract or full text copy of the study, call the Center for
Energy and Economic Development office in Washington at 202-
628-5627.

May, June spot prices stay weak in light trading

     Many in the gas industry began stretching the three-day holiday
weekend into four days by taking off all or part of last Friday, so
trading was light for both May and June supplies.
     May prices in South Louisiana changed little for deals done
Friday morning, but prices in South Texas dropped into the mid- to
high-$1.50s into Natural Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL), Koch
Gateway Pipeline, Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Trunkline Gas.
     Very few deals were reported done Friday for June, but there
were no signs of a recovery in spot prices. One source reported a
sale into Texas Gas Transmission (TGT) in zone SL at $1.71. The gas
is baseloaded from Thursday through the rest of the month.
     All three nuclear plants operated by Arizona Public Service are
scheduled to be operating by tomorrow, but they will run at less
than full capacity for the rest of the year.
     Palo Verde Unit 3, which has been down for refueling, is
scheduled to start up tomorrow. All three of Palo Verde's 1,270 MW
plants will then be generating electricity.
     But the units won't run any higher than 86% of capacity because
of potential problems with the tubes that carry steam up through
the boilers. The steam turns turbines to generate electricity. Small
cracks have appeared in the tubes, said a source at the utility.
     During periods of peak electrical demand, the utility will burn
natural gas to generate electricity or buy power from other
companies, he said.

June market leaves many unanswered questions

     A lot of questions will begin to be answered today and tomorrow,
but weather will set the tone for prices throughout the month.
     How much gas was sold swing? How many buyers, particularly
the big guys, the LDCs, held off buying until after the first of the
month? How will the nuclear plants near Houston and Dallas
perform after being restarted?
     Not to mention shut-ins. Is gas being shut in because of price or
because of no market? Will producers voluntarily shut in enough
gas to have an impact on prices? And lastly, is it ever going to get
hot and muggy in Texas?
     Beginning with the last question, a couple of sources said TU
Electric in the Dallas area is expecting temperatures in North
Texas to move into the 90s this week and is asking suppliers to be
prepared to ship gas. Temperatures in Oklahoma, likewise, are
expected to move into the 90s today, if not yesterday.
     TU Electric also operates the Comanche Peak nuclear plant where
Unit Two is out of service to repair cracked welds. A two-week
delay in the restart date has been penciled in, indicating a restart
around mid-June.
     As reported, TU burns nuclear and lignite as baseload and uses
gas for peaking needs. But the lignite units are running at maximum
levels now, said one source, which is why TU is preparing to call on
gas if temperatures rise.
     Unit Two at the South Texas Nuclear Plant near Houston was
running at 12% of capacity last Friday morning and was expected to
put electricity onto the grid system on Sunday or yesterday. It
could be at 100% of capacity in the first or second week this month.
     Only one June deal was reported on Friday, a large package at
the Katy Interchange on an intrastate pipeline at $1.65, down a
penny on the low end from Thursday's range of $1.66-70.
     May intrastate prices fell below $1.60 in South Texas and below
$1.40 in West Texas. Producers had little fight left in them to
quibble over a few pennies for a period of a few days. They wanted
gas to flow and were afraid there'd be no market at all over the
light-demand holiday weekend.

Texaco to cut staff at Henry Plant

     Texaco will eliminate 32 of 70 jobs at its Henry Plant, near
Erath, La., and the Henry Hub, by the end of the year, the company
told Gas Daily.
     The reduction in the workforce is required because of changing
operations at the facility, a spokesperson said. Texaco will no
longer be processing liquids at the plant.
     The company said liquids extraction is unprofitable in the
current low-price environment for natural gas liquids. In addition,
gas delivered to the hub usually does not need processing.
     Operations at the hub itself are not affected, said Jagit Yadov,
president of Texaco's Sabine Pipeline, operator of the Henry Hub.

Midcoast to build New York pipeline

     Midcoast Energy Resources is staking out new turf, constructing
a natural gas pipeline in Bethlehem, N.Y., to serve the Owens-
Corning Del Mar plant.
     This 3 million cf system will be the first New York project for
Midcoast, a Corpus Christi, Texas-based company that has
primarily served industrial end-users in the Midwest and Gulf
Coast.
     The system is slated for completion by June 30, and will include
interconnect facilities with an existing pipeline owned by
Tennessee Gas Pipeline.
     "Midcoast continues to pursue significant opportunities to
provide gas transportation services to industrial customers at
substantial discounts from their present suppliers," Midcoast
President Dan Tutcher said.
     Fiscal year 1993 revenues for publicly held Midcoast were about
$16 million. Midcoast also serves the Owens Corning Fiberglass
Plant in Kansas City, Kansas.

TransCanada forms Mexican partnership

     TransCanada PipeLines and Corporacion Gutsa, one of Mexico's
leading construction companies, have signed a letter of
understanding for joint efforts in a variety of projects in Mexico.
     "We intend to work together with Gutsa in the areas of power
generation facilities and the supply, distribution and
commercialization of natural gas in Mexico," said Gerald Maier,
TransCanada's chairman.
     The Mexican ambassador to Canada, Sandra Fuentes-Berain, said
the partnership is evidence of the success of the North American
Free Trade Agreement.
     TransCanada also has revised its 1995-96 facilities construction
application to the Canadian National Energy Board (NEB). The
pipeline is seeking approval to build 16.8 miles of line in Ontario
and Manitoba and a 28 MW compressor in Ontario.
     This is in addition to the 17.3 miles of line and 42.3 MW of
compression included in the earlier application. Total cost of all
the projects is estimated at C$189.3 million.
     If approved by the NEB, TransCanada plans to begin construction
in 1995 and put the facilities into service by Nov. 1 next year.
     The new facilities would add 88.8 million cfd of firm, long-haul
capacity to the pipeline.

Industry, FERC agree to keep recovery mechanism

     Industry and FERC apparently see eye-to-eye about keeping
intact the pricing differential mechanism that pipelines use to
recover gas supply realignment (GSR) costs.
     Industry participants assembled at a technical conference in
Washington last week to voice general approval of the recovery
mechanism. FERC commissioners seemed to agree that the two-year
recovery program should not be altered.
     Order 636 required pipelines to reform their contracts to
market levels or terminate them altogether. The rule provided for
recovery of the costs associated with realigning the bundled-sales
contracts. The commission determined last year, in various cases,
that it would permit pipelines to collect the difference between the
market price and the price established in their contracts as a
recovery mechanism for the GSR costs. The mechanism has been in
place for only 11 months of its proposed two-year period.
     Customer complaints that pipelines were taking advantage of the
pricing mechanism prompted the commission to take a look at the
GSR recovery option, despite Commissioner Donald Santa's concern
that the commission was considering a "mid-stream change." The
customers were concerned that pipelines were getting windfall
profits through the mechanism.
     But many of the complaints were squelched before the
conference took place, after pipelines helped their customers
realize that the pricing differential recoveries would cost them less
than federally ordered buyouts of the contracts.      Many of the
customers simply didn't realize the trade-offs that the pipelines
have made on their costs, a representative of the Natural Gas Supply
Assn (NGSA) said. Some pipelines have eaten many of their
transition costs, the representative added.
     Nicholas Bush, president of NGSA, said the pricing differential
costs are part of larger compromise agreements negotiated between
pipelines and their customers. "Altering these compromises would
upset the balance of interests achieved in those original settlement
agreements," he said. "A change in course before the expiration of
this limited period, as some have suggested doing, would send a
confusing signal."
     Many of the pipelines noted in comments on the issue that most
of their contracts would be terminated by the end of the two-year
period.

Coastal to sell Argentine operations

     Coastal is selling its 23.33% interest in five producing oil and
natural gas fields and related facilities in Tierra del Fuego
province of Argentina for $68 million plus contingent
considerations.
     The sale will be to other joint-interest owners in the venture,
Coastal said. The transaction is subject to certain approvals and
will be completed next month.
     "This sale gives Coastal an attractive return on its initial
investment," said David Arledge, Coastal's president and COO. "At
the same time, it provides additional funds for other opportunities
the company currently has under review."

Anadarko buys Hugoton reserves

         Anadarko Petroleum has signed
an agreement to purchase deep producing
oil and gas properties in the Hugoton
area of southwest Kansas.
         Anadarko would not say who it
was purchasing the properties from
because of an agreement with the
operator, but the $20 million deal is
expected to close by June 15. About 60%
of the reserves are crude oil.
         Anadarko expects average net
production of about 1.4 million cfd of
gas and about 500 barrels of oil per
day, to be marketed under short-term
contracts.

PG&E pursues first regional
electronic hub

         SAN FRANCISCO -- In what
could develop into the first regional
electronic marketing hub, Pacific Gas &
Electric (PG&E) is pursuing the
development of an electronic energy
marketplace (EEM) by as early as 1996
that would allow all segments of the
industry from Alberta to the Southwest
to come together and conduct business
on one electronic system.
         "It's in the conceptualization
stage," Kenneth Hamkik, PG&E's director
of strategic planning, told Gas Markets
Week. "That means what we're trying to
do is look at the long term in relation
to what's happening in 1993 with the
implementation of Order 636 and FERC
trying to push standardization," he
said.
         "It's a marketplace," said
Hamik, "and a marketplace implies that
you have multiple players that can come
together on a single log-in, in this
case, and have the ease of use to be
able to do business in a number of new
ways," he said.
         Along with Southern California
Gas and San Diego Gas & Electric, which
both agree with the concept of an EEM,
according to Hamik, PG&E may be
starting what could be called a local
distribution company (LDC) revolution
in the gas industry.
         Hamik said with all the
competition going on in the pipeline
segment of the industry with their
proprietary electronic bulletin boards
(EBBs), seeds are starting to be sown
with the LDCs to make sense of the
chaos. He said LDCs want to get in
front of EBB developments and form an
electronic marketplace where they get
full benefit of the business
opportunities out there.
         He said it will probably have
to start on the regional level and "the
LDCs should at least have a heavy-
handed influence to help shape this."
Hamik said pipelines won't be excluded
in the process, but LDCs will benefit
the most from regional EEMs.
         Hamik said the EEM will go
beyond the traditional posting systems
of EBBs, "Technology is not the
barrier," Hamik said, "There's a lot of
vendors that have already started to
present Windows-based products where
you don't have to know boo about
computers," he added.
         And one of those vendors
working on the West Coast EEM is
Interactive Images, headed by the
former manager of Enron's information
systems Robert Hadlow. Hadlow said with
the free market environment evolving
from Order 636, the West Coast natural
gas industry is going to need an EEM
that will serve as a common electronic
hub through which all segments of the
industry can conduct their daily
business. He said the system will need
to be quick, easy to use and users
should be able to work across multiple
companies.
         Hadlow said the EEM will
differ from EBBs in that it will
initiate and approve transactions
through the entire daisy chain of
transactions on behalf of all the
customers it serves. Through the EEM,
Hadlow said, from producer to end-user,
including futures and secondary market
players, all users will be able to
conduct business across multiple
companies as if those companies were
one.
         He said the EEM will not
replace each industry segment's
internal proprietary systems, but it
will replace their EBBs with a single,
common system for the West Coast
market.
         PG&E's Hamik said the first
phase of developing the West Coast EEM
was identifying the landscape. "What
are the baby steps or maybe even some
of the big leaps we need to start
taking now in order to bridge the
future with the present?"
          Hamik said when developing
the scenario for the implementation of
the EEM, PG&E looked at the banking and
airline industries as an example of how
fast the EEM could be developed.
         He said one company can't make
the EEM happen. It will have to be a
consortium. "The marketplace has to be
open or it's not going to work," said
Hamik. He said PG&E has talked to 20 to
25 different companies and the answer
it's received have been "yes" to the
EEM, but opinions differ on how it's
going to happen. Hamik said some
companies are "bearish" on the issue of
having the EEM up and running by the
end of the decade.
         "I don't get involved in
projects that don't happen within the
decade," was Hadlow's response. Hadlow
also said he is in the process of
estimating the cost of the project but
no firm figures are available yet.
         Hadlow proposed a possible
timeline for the implementation of the
West Coast EEM:
         % 1994: PG&E's system
operational for transactions;
         % 1995: Multi-company access
available;
         % 1996: Some cross-company
transaction capabilities;
         % 1997: West Coast EEM fully
operational;
         % 1998: Links to other
regional EEMs achieved;
         % 1999: North American EEM
fully operational.
         For more information on the
West Coast EEM, contact Hadlow at 415-

Buyers position themselves for
cold weekend

         Prices were up everywhere on
Thursday -- Gulf Coast, Midcontinent
and West Texas -- as buyers wanted to
ensure they had a supplier for what was
expected to be a winter-like weekend.
         Sellers limited sales to one
day only in most cases, playing for
more time and more threats of chilling
temperatures to push prices up another
few pennies Friday through Monday.
         The exception was West Texas
where California buyers are having to
compete with gas going to Texas
intrastate markets and gas headed north
into the mouth of the cold front.
Buyers and sellers were negotiating
deals for Saturday through Tuesday, but
talks were in a very narrow range for
both swing and four-day deals.
         Sellers asked $2.02 and buyers
tried to keep the lid on at $2.00 even,
up from $1.91-95 Wednesday. A marketer
bought a four-day deal at $2.00, while
another marketer sold Saturday only
packages at $2.00-01 and was working on
wrapping up some four-day deals.
         Gulf Coast Louisiana prices
ranged from $2.32-34 for most sales
into Columbia, with a high of $2.35, up
from a high of $2.30 the day before.
There was only a penny spread between
equity sales and marketers' resales,
said one source.
         Texas Eastern at East
Louisiana was $2.30-33. A marketer sold
5 million at the Transco Station 65
pooling point at $2.30. A marketer
bought 50 million cfd on Texas Gas SL
at $2.35, up from a high of $2.30 a day
earlier.
         Midcontinent prices jumped to
$2.05-09 on Panhandle Eastern for
purchases, while sales topped at $2.10.
Wednesday's Panhandle gas topped out at
$2.02. One buyer turned back Panhandle
gas at $2.10, however, while a buyer on
Arkla resisted a $2.10 price and got
the seller to come down to $2.07.
Marketers bought a range of $2.06-09 on
Arkla, up from $2.04-08 the day before.
         Houston Ship Channel prices
jumped to $2.28 Thursday up from $2.22-
25 earlier in the week. Katy prices,
which had moved up earlier, stayed flat
at $2.20-24 Thursday, with one price
reported at $2.25.
         South Texas prices ranged from
$2.15-22 on Texas Eastern on the mid-
Gulf Coast. A package of 10 million cfd
was sold into Koch Gateway in the same
area at $2.24, competing with prices
into Houston Pipe Line at $2.19-20, up
from a previous high of $2.17. A
package in deep south Texas went for
$2.15, and packages were was sold into
Tejas Natural Gas near Agua Dulce at
$2.17-18.
         Meanwhile, Permian and San
Juan basin prices rebounded on at mid-
week from a low Tuesday of at least
$1.84 back to $1.90 and above for
Friday deals.
         Swing prices into El Paso
Natural Gas had dropped last Monday and
Tuesday for a combination of reasons. A
Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) gas-fired
power plant went down early in the
week, causing some loss of gas demand,
although two smaller gas-fired units
were brought on line by the utility,
said a source, PG&E did cut 100
million-140 million cfd.
         The utility also picked up
some cheaper supplies out of Canada,
displacing more supplies out of the
Permian and San Juan. Another source
said PG&E had to turn back 70 million
of baseload gas because of an
operational problem. Southern
California Gas (SoCal) also cut about
80 million of swing last Monday, said a
source.
         But all that turned around
Wednesday, PG&E will be bringing the
big power plant back on line Saturday
and the baseload supplies will be
flowing again tomorrow, said a
marketer.
         A California utility on
Wednesday was trying to buy gas in the
Permian to flow Thursday through
Tuesday at $1.90 into El Paso. The
company apparently was trying to do the
five-day deals to lock up supplies
before a predicted cold front was
expected to swoop into Texas this past
weekend. A supplier said his company's
weather report had predicted
temperatures would drop to 35 in
Houston Sunday.
         "The smart seller will sell
his gas one day at a time starting at
$1.90-92 for Friday," said a supplier
late last week. "Then he'll get better
prices for Saturday through Tuesday."

First day of Order 636 operation
seen as smooth

         A number of pipelines
completed the transition to operating
under Order 636 last week and officials
were generally saying "so far, so
good."
         Officials at Koch Gateway
Pipeline, Pacific Gas Transmission,
Mississippi River Transmission,
Columbia Gas Transmission, Columbia
Gulf Transmission and Northwest
Pipeline all said the transition was
going smoothly. Others scheduled to
implement Order 636 yesterday included
Northern Natural Gas, Viking Gas
Transmission, Southern Natural Gas,
Texas Gas Transmission and ANR
Pipeline.
         "Considering the number of new
services and the magnitude of the
changes that we've had to implement,
we've been pleased with the initial
month's nominiations process and
pleased with our first day operating
under Order 636," said a Columbia Gas
official. "We are experiencing the
typical minor bugs and startup problems
that you would expect under such a big
change, but there's nothing that we're
overly concerned about, that we won't
be able to work out," he added.
                  Joe Pollard, director
of transportation services for Great
Lakes, said the pipeline began its
capacity release and flexible receipt
and delivery point programs today, and
there's been no major trouble. There
have been a number of assignments,
releases and conversions as part of the
transition, but everything has gone
smoothly, he added.
         Pacific Gas Transmission (PGT)
had the fullest plate yesterday, as it
began operations under Order 636 and
began transporting expansion volumes.
According to a spokesperson, the
pipeline also started its electronic
bulletin board and had its first
capacity releases.
         The expansion allows PGT to
transport more than 2.4 billion cfd to
the Pacific Northwest and California.
Total PGT volumes were running about
1.6 billion cfd yesterday, and the
contracted expansion volumes of about
900 million cfd were about 70% full,
the spokesperson said. About 340
million cfd of the total system volumes
were moving under interruptible
contracts, he added.
         "We're very pleased to have
reached our goal on schedule," said
Stephen Reynolds, PGT president and
CEO. "Getting from blueprints to
reality on a project of this magnitude
required an incredible amount of
groundwork and follow-through."
         On a related note, Alberta &
Southern Gas ceased buying and selling
gas yesterday after more than 30 years.
Alberta & Southern transported about
9.5 trillion cf of gas through a long-
term contract with PGT to California.
         San Diego Gas & Electric
reported no problems so far early last
week getting its first volumes from the
PGT expansion.
         San Diego is getting about 54
million cfd of gas off the expanded
line from four Calgary suppliers: Bow
Valley Industries, Canadian Hunter
Marketing, Summit Resources and Husky
Oil Operations.
         The contracts range from eight
to 11 years, with prices indexed to the
market. According to SDG&E's latest 10-
K, future minimum payments under the
Canadian deals are forecast to be $6
million in 1993. $36 million in 199,
$38 million in 1995, $40 million in
1996, $42 million in 1997 and $281
million thereafter.
         For the remainder of its spot
gas for November, San Diego received
more than 180 bids from 45 companies
for a total 1.8 billion cfd.
         The utility accepted 15 bids
from 11 companies for a total of about
160 million cfd. About 85 million of
that came from the San Juan Basin on El
Paso Natural Gas, 27 million was bought
into Transwestern Pipeline in the
Permian Basin and the central zone at
station 8. Another 48 million was
bought at the border, and 10 million
cfd of spot gas came from Canada.
         As of the end of October, San
Diego's storage allotments were full,
the buyers added.

Centran creditors could be repaid
this year

         The old Centran has a new
name, a new parent and a new balance
sheet, and creditors of the
Minneapolis-based marketer might be
paid part of what they are owed by the
end of the year.
         Northern States Power (NSP)
christened the marketer "Cenergy" late
last month after acquiring most of the
assets Oct. 1. Cenergy "has had capital
infused" by the new parent, explained
Vice President Bruce Hoffarber, but
otherwise has its own relationship with
regional bank Norwest.
         It appears the financing of
Cenergy will have to be separate from
its parent. In general, public
utilities in Minnesota are not allowed
to finance their unregulated
subsidiaries, explained Bob Harding, a
rates analyst at the state Public
Utility Commission.
         NSP's creation of Cenergy and
acquisition of Viking Gas Transmission
will be examined by the commission in
the future, Harding added.
         Hoffarber said Centran was
marketing about 70 million cfd in
October, and Cenergy is doing 100
million cfd of business in November. He
added that Cenergy cannot do business
with NSP Gas.
         Meanwhile, the creditors
committee of Centran has hired a
liquidator, Jim Bartholomew, to dispose
of the estate of what is now a paper
entity. And sources said a plan to
divide the remaining assets is expected
to be filed with the federal bankruptcy
court in Minneapolis by next week.
         The assets would include the
purchase price of $2.2 million paid for
Centran, another $235,000 from the sale
of a gathering system, revenues from
the sale of a coal company and a grain
elevator and other cash. Also, NSP will
pay another $250,000 on Jan. 17 as part
of a "holdback" in the deal.
         Bartholomew's job is to
collect any accounts still receivable
by Centran and eventually make
distributions, said Charles Hofer,
credit manager at Trident NGL and
chairman of the creditors committee.
         Creditors and a judge have to
approve the plan before any
disbursements, but Hofer said he
expects most of the funds to be
distributed at year's end, some in
March 1994 and some a year later.
         He told Gas Daily that he
expects creditors to get 20-30 cents on
the dollar. "We did not leave the
decisions to the lawyers," he said. "We
were very aware of the costs that could
eat up a  bankruptcy and tried to limit
the administrative expense."
         One of the smaller creditors
that wasn't involved on the committee
said it expects to get $50,000 to
$60,000, but is not optimistic about
getting it soon.
         Centran was the first of a
number of marketers that filed for
court protection from creditors this
year.

Indiana utility fights 20-year cap

         FERC's order refusing Texas
Gas Transmission's proposed 10-year cap
on contracts with its customers is
unlawful, according to Indiana Gas.
         A cap maximizes the number of
years specific types of contracts can
be bargained for. The commission chose
to keep Texas Gas customer contracts
capped at 20 years.
         Indiana Gas said last month's
order is "unwise" and "highly
contradictory" considering commission
comments in a previous FERC order.
         FERC stated in July, "We
believe the 10-year cap proposed by
Texas Gas is a reasonable compromise
between the 20-year maximum and the
three to five-year caps proposed by the
commentors."
         The utility said the
commission's final decision was
"unsupported by substantial evidence of
record" and that 20 years is an
"excessive time period given the
dynamic nature of the gas market which
exists today."
         Indiana Gas noted that only
one commentor, Fuel Managers
Associates, opposed the 10-year cap,
and, to the best of Indiana Gas'
knowledge, no member of the association
is currently a Texas Gas customer. "It
would be unreasonable to shackle Texas
Gas customers with a 20-year contract
cap simply because someone alleges
potential future customers desire a
longer term."  (RS92-24).

SoCal gets active in refinancing

         Holders of SoCal Gas' Series X
first mortgage bonds will have to
accept a lower yield if they decide to
sell them back to the utility in an
offer announced last week. But the high
coupon bonds may have a limited life
anyway, since the utility can call them
Dec. 1, 1995.
         SoCal Gas will buy any and all
of its $120 million of 9.75% first
mortgage bonds due 2020, but the offer
expires Nov. 10. The purchase price for
the bond will be determined by using a
yield to the maturity of the U.S.
Treasury 5.125% notes due Nov. 15,
1995, plus 0.15% and accrued interest.

Gulf Coast indexes up 5-10 cents
for November

         Gas Daily's Monthly Contract
Indexes for November along the Gulf
Coast were up 5-10 cents while most
Midcontinent indexes dropped a penny,
setting the stage for what many sources
are expecting for next month -- higher
after-market prices.
         The November index for
supplies into Texas Gas Transmission
jumped 11 cents over the October index
to $2.08, the biggest increase this
month in south Louisiana. The index for
supplies into Columbia Gulf
Transmission finished at $2.11, up 7
cents.
         November indexes for
Midcontinent volumes into ANR Pipeline,
Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line and Natural
Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL) each
fell a penny. The Panhandle and ANR
indexes finished at $1.90, while the
NGPL was $1.87 in Oklahoma. The index
for volumes into Northern Natural Gas
in the field climbed 3 cents, while the
indexes into Northern at Ventura and at
the demarcation point each dropped a
penny to $1.89. Firm transportation
rates under Order 636 allowed buyers to
pay higher prices in the field while
getting lower prices at Ventura and at
the demarcation point, sources said.
         The November index for
supplies into El Paso Natural Gas in
the Permian Basin was unchanged from
October to November, remaining at
$1.80. Those who sold baseload supplies
during bid week were probably
regretting that by the end of last week
as swing prices climbed above $2.

FERC commissioners get up to speed
on GISB

         Industry officials
representing the Gas Industry Standards
Board (GISB) took a seat before the
FERC commissioners yesterday to answers
questions on the board's progress
before its debut next September.
         The panel said the scope will
probably be narrow at first and the
target date for an up and running GISB
is Sept. 1, 1994.
         After a general rundown of
developments so far of GISB, FERC
Commissioner Donald Santa asked the
representatives to explain the
jurisdictional tie between the
standards the board may come up with
and FERC's responsibilities under the
Natural Gas Act.
         Marvin Clifton with Mobil
Natural Gas answered they didn't know
the answer to that question but the
board's attorneys could provide FERC
with the answer.
         On the same track as Santa,
FERC Chair Elizabeth Moler said issues
that GISB proposes to take up in its
second generation such as the
definition of gas day, notice
requirements, nominations and systems
balancing "are all directly FERC
jurisdictional items and will require
changes in FERC tariffs."
         "To the extent the FERC has
jurisdiction over something and the
pipelines are required to make tariff
changes obviously they would proceed
and FERC would act accordingly," said
Consolidated Edison's Steve Salese.
         "We hope that what we would be
doing though is coming to the
commission with something that the
industry has said 'This is going to
work for us' just like we've done in
the working groups," said Salese.
         When asked by FERC
Commissioner Vickey Bailey about the
make up and management of GISB, Mike
Bray with Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line
said the board has gotten past the
initial criticism of its make up. Chuck
Linderman with the Edison Electric
Institute said if anyone feels left out
of the process, the question should be
asked of them, "Where were you?"
         Another criticism Bailey said
was being voiced is that GISB is just
another level of regulation for the gas
industry.
         Mobil's Clifton said, "If that
is true, then I would like to withdraw
my support for GISB." He said the
purpose of GISB is to get the industry
together to develop industry solutions.
Clifton stressed that GISB is not meant
to add regulation to the industry.

Mining company doesn't get rights

         The Alabama Supreme Court
ruled recently that the rights to drill
for gas in coalbeds do not belong to a
mining company.
         In a blow to the already
financially strapped mining company,
Jim Walter Resources is not entitled to
develop and sell the coalbed methane
gas that accumulates in an area of the
mine that houses mining refuse, ruled
the Alabama Supreme Court.
         The court said Jim Walter
Resources (JWR) may develop the coalbed
gas that is within the coal seam,
which, in any event, must be ventilated
for safety reasons. But once the
coalbed gas migrates out of the coal
seam and into the gob -- underground
coal dumping area -- the gas then
belongs to the holder of the gas
estate, the court ruled last month.
         The gob methane gas production
represents 70% of the gas captured from
the operation, which is then sold.
         The case stems from two
appeals to gain title to coalbed
methane gas on property in Tuscaloosa
County, Ala. JWR sought title to the
gas it has been selling in a
partnership with Sonat Coal Gas and
others. The company sued NCNB Nations
Bank of Texas to gain title of the
methane gas, and the bank counter-sued.
         The land that JWR is mining is
subject to 1953 and 1954 deeds, which
conveyed the property owner's interest
to the coal to what is now JWR, but
reserved the property owner's interest
in "all gas." NCNB is the trustee of
the estate, and owns a 22.5% interest
in all the gas reserved by the deed.
         The court had to decide
whether the deed, which conveyed all of
the coal and connected mining rights to
JWR, but reserved the rights to all of
the gas to the property owner, also
reserved the rights of the coalbed
methane gas to the property owner.
         In a jury trial, the lower
court determined that all of the gas
produced from the property was coalbed
gas and that none of the gas resided in
a non-coal area before mining.
         The court said the language in
the deeds in this case is unambiguous.
The deeds specifically reserve "all of
the oil, gas, petroleum and sulphur in,
on and under" the areas where JWR mines
to the property owner.
         Neither JWR nor the bank
dispute that the coalbed gas is "gas,"
and the court said it could find "no
scientific or legal basis to support
the proposition that coalbed methane
gas should be treated as a resource
separate and distinct from other
natural gas."
         However, the court added that
property law cases indicate that the
ownership of the gas depends upon the
location of the gas at the time it is
captured or located.

Curtis nominated by president

         The first chairman of FERC,
Charles Curtis, will get the tap as
under secretary of energy, President
Clinton said.
         If confirmed, Curtis will be
in charge of science and technology
programs, waste cleanup, nuclear
weapons programs and energy policy.
Thomas Grumbly, assistant secretary for
environmental restoration and waste
management, has been acting under
secretary.
         "There are few Americans who
can match Charles Curtis' governmental
experience, or his knowledge of energy
policy," the president said in his
announcement.
         At FERC, Curtis solidified a
reputation as scholarly and fair.
Curtis had served as chief counsel to
the House Energy Committee for five
years when President Carter nominated
him to be the last chairman of the
Federal Power Commission (FPC) in 1977.
         Under a separate nomination a
month later, Curtis became FERC's first
chairman. The new commission took over
all the FPC tasks, with the addition of
oil pipeline rate regulation and
deciding appeals from price control
hearings in the Energy Dept. He has
worked at the Securities and Exchange
Commission,  and is now a partner in
the Washington law firm of Van Ness,
Feldman & Curtis.

barrels of oil equivalent, including
oil, gas and natural gas liquids.
         Development plans include
nominating gas plant processing
capacity of 38 million cfd in a new
facility to be built by 1995. Oil and
natural gas liquids production from the
area is forecast to exceed 1,000
barrels per day, and Suncor is also

Amoco sets up trading room in
Houston

         Amoco is hoping to have its
new gas trading room operating in
February, the major's new natural gas
vice president told reporters last
week.
         "We may not be first but we
hope to have the best" gas trading
room, Rebecca McDonald, Amoco
Production's natural gas vice president
said. Amoco has learned from the
mistakes of others, she added, which
have already set up trading-type rooms
at other companies, including Tenneco,
where McDonald headed the marketing
division before coming to Amoco.
         About 80 out of the gas
division's 200 employees will work in
the Houston trading room where futures
traders, cash traders, transportation
representatives and gas control people
will be centralized, said McDonald.
         The trading room is a result
of customer meetings initiated by
McDonald seeking to expand the services
offered by the major.
         The customers wanted more
creative solutions to contracting with
financial hedging instruments something
some wanted Amoco's help with, McDonald
said.
         McDonald's hiring signifies
the "cultural change" at Amoco, which
has realized that the business of
natural gas is different than the
business of oil, according to Bill
Benham, Amoco's vice president of
regulatory affairs.
         Amoco wants to make sure it
gets the most for its natural gas
assets, Benham added, with a shift to
gas marketing signifying the commitment
the major now sees for natural gas.
         She added that Amoco plans to
buy even more gas from third parties
this winter and next year. Amoco now
buys about 250 million cfd to 300
million cfd from independents to add to
the major's portfolio. Amoco is asking
some producers to "double and triple"
their sales to it, contending that
selling to Amoco adds value to the
independents' gas.          DM

Sluggish demand expected to slow
1993 growth

         NEW ORLEANS -- Producers
have now lowered their expectations
that gas demand will again be strong
this year, with the Independent
Petroleum Assn. of America (IPAA)
predicting gas use will rise only about
1% to "just kiss 20 trillion cf."
         Gas demand has risen for the
last couple of years by about 3% a year
with the expectation by most in the
industry that gas use would continue to
grow at those levels this year as well.
         But IPAA's latest short-term
supply and demand outlook released
yesterday at its annual meeting shows
that gas demand may not even rise by 1%
this year, with the outlook only
slightly more optimistic for next year
when demand is expected to increase
1.4% and finally top the 20 trillion
cf/year level not seen since 1979. Gas
demand last year was 19.78 trillion cf.
         Increased electric generation
using hydropower and nuclear power was
the biggest factor for lower gas demand
this year, members of IPAA's supply and
demand committee told reporters
yesterday. IPAA's forecast shows that
gas use for electric generation this
year will likely fall by 4.7% and is
predicted to drop another 1.4% in 1994.
IPAA uses figures released from the
Energy Information Administration for
the first two quarters of this year as
a basis to predict gas demand for the
remaining half of the year.
         In addition, oil prices,
including residual fuel, were
significantly lower than expected and
industrial fuel-switching customers
chose resid over gas this year, IPAA
said. Higher natural gas prices this
year also contributed to the lower than
expected demand, said Larry Hilgers,
market and risk assessment manager for
Oryx, the committee's chairman.
         IPAA had predicted last year
that demand would be up as much as 3%
this year. Despite "limited" gas demand
growth, demand for coal is expected to
rise by 3% this year even with the
Mississippi River floods and strikes.
Hydropower use is seen rising by 5%
this year and nuclear powered
generation is also expected to be up by
2% in 1993, according to IPAA.
         "As soon as gas demand last
winter didn't materialize, we began to
suspect that we may have been too
optimistic last year," said Hilgers.
         Increased use of hydropower in
the Northwest and the West probably
took about 200 billion cfd and 300
billion cfd of gas demand away, Hilgers
added.
         Gas imports from Canada are
expected to slow this year to only a 5%
increase over last year to about 2.2
trillion cf/year. Canadian gas imports
increased by about 10% last year. IPAA
attributed the slowing Canadian import
growth to increased competition driving
the market.
         IPAA also predicted slowed gas
exports to Mexico by 11% to 192 billion
cf this year due to the change in the
relative price between gas and fuel
oil.          DM

U.S. Natural Gas Supply and Demand
-- 1993 Forecast
Producers target SoCal fee

         More major producers are
calling Southern California Gas'
(SoCal) fee to access one of its
pipeline interconnections "illegal and
discriminatory."
         Shell, Mobil, Texaco, along
with Pacific Gas & Electric, are just a
few of the new supporters of Union
Pacific's original allegations of
illegal fees.  The original
complaintants were Union Pacific Fuels,
Amoco Energy Trading, and Petro-Canada
Hydrocarbons.
         These shippers/producers are
asking FERC to either declare this fee
null and void requiring a refund, or
regulate SoCal as an interstate
pipeline.
         Union Pacific claims the fee
is an intrastate rate designed to
recover costs associated with certain
SoCal downstream compression
facilities. And, the company said,
SoCal is charging this rate to shippers
delivering upstream of the intrastate
facilities.
         Union Pacific added that if
SoCal is permitted to collect this kind
of fee, there is nothing to prevent
other utilities from imposing tolls.
The fight appears to be yet another
extension of the ongoing jurisdiction
fight between FERC and California
utilities.
         Union Pacific and supporters
allege SoCal has "implemented an
illegal and discriminatory incremental
access fee" charged to interstate
shippers delivering to SoCal's Wheeler
Ridge interconnection. This connects
SoCal with Pacific Gas and Electric,
Transwestern Pipeline, El Paso
Pipeline, and the Kern River Gas-Mojave
system.
         Union Pacific said the fee is
a "burden on interstate commerce that
violates the constitution."
         SoCal admits the fee is an
intrastate rate designed to recover
costs from intrastate compression
facilities, and that it has been only
charging the fees to interstate
shippers and not intrastate shippers.
         In fact, it gives fuel credits
to intrastate shippers. It also
admitted it has told shippers that if
the fee is not paid, delivery of gas
into Wheeler Ridge will not be
permitted.
         What SoCal is denying is that
the fee is in any way illegal or in
violation of federal law. And it firmly
maintains the fee is approved by the
California Public Utilities Commission.
         SoCal explained the Wheeler
Ridge facility was built for interstate
purposes and that some opponents on
this issue rejected the construction
opportunity.
          SoCal also asserts this issue
is not under FERC jurisdiction and that
no precedence exists which addresses
jurisdiction over of an LDC
interconnection charge.

Arcadian, Southern agree to settle
on bypass

         Arcadian Corp. and Southern
Natural Gas are hammering out a
settlement that's expected to end much
of the regulatory and legal proceedings
surrounding the forced bypass of
Atlanta Gas Light (AGL) by Southern to
Arcadian's Augusta, Ga., plant.
         FERC last year reversed a
decision on rehearing and forced
Southern to provide a direct link to
the Augusta fertilizer plant, bypassing
AGL, which is Southern's biggest
customer. FERC found that Southern was
acting in a discriminatory manner when
it refused the Arcadian link after
providing a similar bypass for an Air
Products & Chemicals plant in New
Orleans. Arcadian started getting gas
directly from Southern in January, and
estimates the connection will save it
about $4.4 million per year.
         Southern, AGL and others
appealed the FERC decision in the 11th
Circuit Court of Appeals, but the case
hasn't been decided.
         Before FERC granted the link,
Arcadian filed an antitrust suit
against Southern and AGL in U.S. court
in Georgia, charging them with a
"conspiracy" to protect the
distributor's "monopoly" hold on its
service area. Arcadian asked for
damages of $45 million plus court
costs. That case is still pending as
well.
         Announcement of the deal by
Arcadian last week was forced by the
companies' pending quarterly reports,
which mention the settlement, according
to Randall Saint Aubyn, Arcadian's vice
president, gas department.
         The settlement will result in
the withdrawal of all regulatory and
court action by all parties, to the
agreement, Saint Aubyn indicated.
         "The settlement also will
enable us to avoid the costs and
uncertainties associated with the
antitrust lawsuit and related
litigation and to establish a
beneficial, long-term commercial
relationship with Southern," said Doug
Campbell, president and CEO of
Arcadian.
         James Cleary, vice president
and general counsel at Southern, said
the pipeline's position would be known
once the settlement is filed at FERC,
which is expected to happen in the next
week.
         Some sources close to Arcadian
suggested there will likely be some
cash payment or discounted services by
Southern involved as well, but it may
not be disclosed by the companies. The
settlement also may address payment of
transition and take-or-pay costs to
Southern for which AGL is liable from
serving the Augusta plant.
         Another obstacle Arcadian
still faces is action by the Georgia
Public Service Commission (PSC) earlier
this year, which asserted jurisdiction
over negative imbalances on Southern's
system. The PSC, acting on a suggestion
from Atlanta Gas Light, contends that
any imbalance gas sold to Arcadian as a
result of an imbalance on Southern's
system is actually a retail sale and
subject to state jurisdiction. If the
PSC were to press the issue, it could
order Southern to stop transporting gas
to Arcadian until it applies for state
certification of such "sales." Saint
Aubyn said Arcadian expects this
problem to be resolved soon, since it
has asked for a summary judgement of
the issue.         SG

U.S. attorney seeks court order
against Iroquois

         A federal prosecutor has
sought to block Iroquois Gas
Transmission from taking testimony from
a long-time pipeline foe in a contract
dispute in order to protect the ongoing
federal criminal investigation.
         Craig Benedict, assistant U.S.
attorney for the Northern District of
New York, is seeking a court order from
a U.S. district court judge to prevent
Iroquois from taking a deposition from
Anne Mueser in a case brought by L.A.
Topsoil Co. seeking damages against the
pipeline. The disgruntled contractor
wants more than $3 million for failure
to pay for work contracted.
         Benedict is heading the
investigation that is a result of a
raid by the FBI on Iroquois' office
last year.
         Mueser has been the head the
GASP coalition, a group of landowners
originally opposed to Iroquois, and is
now working for a construction
contractor which helped build the
pipeline. As a long-time participant in
the environment and regulatory review,
she was in a position to know whether
or not permits were in compliance with
federal and state laws. She was witness
to some of the work performed by the
disgruntled contractor.
         The subpoena issued by the
court on behalf of Iroquois asks Mueser
to reveal her discussions with a list
of federal offices including the
Justice Dept. and the FBI, which have
nothing to do with the civil contract
dispute, the federal attorney told the
court.
         Benedict argues that Iroquois
is using the disposition to try to
uncover information in the ongoing
federal investigation into whether
Iroquois violated environmental laws in
the construction of the pipeline. "It
is important for the court to consider
whether the real motivation behind the
requested civil discovery is to obtain
improper criminal discovery," Benedict
told the court.
         In the motion seeking a court
order, Benedict also admits that the
case against Iroquois is now before a
grand jury.
         Benedict noted that the
federal government is not asking to
block all testimony in the civil case,
"only the prohibition of the taking of
a single disposition." Maybe the
parties "can resolve their contractual
disputes without impinging upon the
federal criminal investigation,"
Benedict added.
         Iroquois said yesterday that
Benedict's motion is just the first
volley of what is expected to be a
number of procedural legal motions in
ongoing suits against the pipeline.
         "There is nothing really
atypical to the action by Mr.
Benedict," an Iroquois official said.
         Mueser told the court that
besides the subpoena from Iroquois for
a disposition scheduled Wednesday,
Iroquois has asked to see all
information Mueser has accumulated on
the pipeline in the last seven years --
about 50 file boxes of materials.
         These boxes are now in the
"custody of the government," Mueser
said, and going through them for
Iroquois would be time-consuming.
         "Iroquois' tactics are a
transparent effort to seek information
that might be helpful in a pending
federal criminal investigation, as well
as an exercise calculated to harass and
cause undue hardship to a non-party
witness who successfully opposed this
company," Mueser told the court. A
legal assistant to the district court
judge said that a decision in the case
is likely by the end of the month.

Santa cites signficance of
gathering in policy

         How FERC handles the gathering
issue should be indicative of how the
entire range of "second-tier" Order 636
issues are dealt with at the
commission, said FERC Commissioner
Donald Santa.
         FERC's determination on how
much regulation is needed in areas
where competition can be shown --
possibly in the gathering issue, Santa
said.
         He said his preliminary notion
about gathering is to be as light-
handed as possible and realize that
gathering is not simply an extension of
transmission with its own set of
problems.
         "We ought to acknowledge this
half-slave half-free nature of
gathering" Santa said. FERC has
scheduled a technical conference in
February to discuss the gathering
issues. Santa outlined at the Natural
Gas Roundtable in Washington yesterday
the issues he sees as critical to
resolving the gathering issue.
          "First, let's get the facts
straight," Santa said about point
number one. "The commission does not
know much about gathering," Santa said.
"The first step is for the commission
to understand how gathering works in
real life."
         Santa noted the primary reason
for the upcoming public conference in
February is so the commission can "make
some well informed policy decisions,
based on fact."
         Second, the commissioner said,
FERC must find an "answer to the
threshold question; whether gathering,
nationally or locally, is a competitive
enterprise. Is regulation needed to
remedy market failure, and conversely
does the existing regulatory scheme
create a marketing failure?"
         Santa said the third basic
objective is to determine the
differences between pipeline, affiliate
and independently owned gathering
systems, and why or if they should be
regulated individually.
         The commissioner noted that
the pending Tenth Circuit Court
decision on Williams Gas Processing vs.
FERC, an argument of FERC jurisdiction
on gathering, may define "the
commission's ability to make some
distinction between pipeline- owned and
affiliate-owned gathering."
         The fourth point, Santa said,
is to answer the question, "does the
commission really need to regulate
gathering in order to satisfy its
statutory obligation?"          RR

Canada eyes NYMEX pricing

         Canadian marketers face the
same decision that their stateside
counterparts have already tackled: how
to use the NYMEX when it does not
reflect local fundamentals.
         NYMEX-based pricing crept into
one-year deals that started Nov. 1, and
many suppliers use it in at least a few
contracts. The next step, traders say,
would be to use it for monthly and
daily pricing.
         The NYMEX has manifested
itself in swap quotes at Empress.
Dealers and large marketers offered to
fix prices there for a year at levels
up to C5 cents higher than cash,
sources said.
         These parties need that
premium to cover their basis risk at
Empress, where the swap market is
illiquid, a marketer said. If they
can't find a counterparty to lay off
the basis, the dealers have to hedge on
the NYMEX, which may not reflect
Alberta prices.
         Using Gas Daily's monthly Nova
index for the past 12 months, adding
C20 cents for transportation to
Empress, and converting it to U.S.
dollars at C78 cents to U.S.$1, the
correlation to the average of the last
three days of futures settlement prices
is 77.7%. The conversions from
gigajoules to mmBtus were also made.
         "Physical players in the
province are not taking this basis
risk," the marketer said.
         This lack of correlation may
work in a supplier's favor at times,
because the swap quotes affect the
physical price quotes. Another marketer
was surprised that Empress prices fell
to $C2.25 per gigajoule this fall, so
he bought some gas at that level.
         And while those contemplating
fixed price swaps are wary about a lack
of correlation with the NYMEX, the
basis risk acceptors are unsure about
trade publication indexes at Empress,
showing risk for both sides of the
trade.
         A third kind of risk is credit
risk, which a Canadian analyst said
prevents swaps more than a year in
duration from being done at Empress.

DOE outlines status of energy law

         The Energy Dept. (DOE)
requirements under the Energy Policy
Act of 1992 (EPACT) will have little
impact on the natural gas industry if
DOE's latest implementation status
report is any indication.
         In fact, under the natural gas
section of EPACT, DOE's only duty is to
automatically approve certain gas
imports and exports. As far as the
status of that, DOE said it is "working
with [FERC] to ensure implementation of
this provision."
         There are other items
scattered throughout the EPACT
Implementation Status Report that could
benefit the gas industry, such as a
number of cost-shared gas technology
projects planned for 1994. The projects
will cover drilling, atlases and
databases, low permeability formations,
fracture technology, upgrading low
quality gas and secondary gas recovery.
         DOE also plans to assist Gas
Research Institute efforts to improve
coalbed methane recovery. Other
programs include a five-year research
and development program to increase the
recoverable natural gas resource base
and another five-year R&D program on
advanced natural gas supply
technologies. DOE is also assisting the
Interior Dept. with an EPACT
requirement to amend various lease
agreements and permits for oil and gas
production.
         DOE does have a number of
requirements under the alternative fuel
vehicles (AFVs) section of EPACT,
however, which includes natural gas
vehicles. For example, in 1994, DOE
must establish data collection by the
Energy Information Administration on
alternative fuels, AFVs and how AFVs
are currently used.
         Some of the AFV programs have
been delayed. DOE was supposed to issue
guidelines to federal agencies to
measure the percentage of alternative
fuel use in dual-fueled vehicles by the
end of October, but that has been
delayed, awaiting action by the Office
of Management and Budget.
         DOE must also issue guidelines
to federal agencies for measuring the
percentage of alternative fuel use, and
issue regulations establishing
guidelines for state AFV incentives and
planning. That was scheduled to be
completed in October as well, but has
been delayed as well. Another plan to
establish a low interest loan program
for businesses that own or operate
fleets for conversion or purchase of
AFVs also scheduled for October
completion has been pushed back to
December.
         DOE has made some progress in
its AFV requirements. The department
has arranged for the purchase of more
than 5,000 AFVs for the federal fleet,
and provided AFV training to federal
employees.

EBB hooks up traders at Alberta's
AECO C hub.

         Alberta Energy kicked off its
electronic bulletin board (EBB)
yesterday when dedicated computer
terminals in the offices of five large
customers were used to nominate gas at
the AECO C hub in southeast Alberta.
         Another 35 customers will get
the terminals later this week, said
Gwyn Morgan, president of AEC Oil and
Gas, and another 40 early next year.
AECO C is a large storage facility and
hub at Suffield, Alberta, where daily
trading occurs.
         The hub is on the Nova system
and is a C10-13 cents haul from
TransCanada PipeLines at the Empress
border station with Saskatchewan.
Morgan said more than 80 companies are
customers there, trading at least 1.7
million cfd.
         Customers using the new AECO
LINK system can make nominations and
communicate with other players at the
hub via the EBB. The system also
provides a record of trades and their
status at the hub.
         "For the exchange of title,
you would get a confirmation back
electronically," Morgan said. "It saves
the telephone tag."
         AECO LINK also allows
customers outside of Alberta to arrange
for transportation after buying gas at
the hub. A balancing service provided
by Alberta Energy is also part of the
EBB.
         The terminals are installed at
no cost to Alberta Energy's customers,
and the system is supported by about 15
people on the marketing staff. He
declined to comment on the cost of the
system, which was developed in-house.
         While players can post if they
are short or long on transportation and
gas, AECO LINK is not yet an electronic
trading network, Morgan added. A
supplemental service is being developed
wherein traders can electronically
inform accountants at Price Waterhouse
about their deals, which would go into
a price index for AECO.
         Traders that participated that
day would have access to the index,
Morgan explained.
         Other companies in Canada,
such as Williams, WestCoast and Direct
Energy  are trying to create electronic
trading networks. Morgan said Alberta
Energy is having discussions with them
about tying into AECO LINK. "The more
services the better," he said.

Edisto to focus on domestic
reserves

         Edisto Exploration &
Production, a unit of Edisto Resources,
acquired a new, more flexible credit
line of $30 million which will be used
to acquire domestic reserves, expand
pipeline operations and attempt to
increase the market share of its gas
marketing operations at Vesta Energy.
International and certain other assets
are being sold.
         In line with increasing market
share, Edisto is pursuing acquisitions
of gas marketing companies to enhance
its Vesta activities. The focus on
marketing shows strong support for
Vesta, which has been the subject of
industry rumors that it would be sold
following Edisto's filing for
bankruptcy and subsequent
reorganization in June. The company has
always denied it.
         Vesta again made headlines in
August when Debbie Branch, president of
the Tulsa-based marketer, left the
company, as well as Robert Davis,
president and CEO of Esco, parent
company of Vesta Branch subsequently
formed her own company and took a
number of Vesta officials with her.
         Newly elected Chairman and CEO
Michael McGovern reviewed Edisto's
assets following its reorganization.
          In addition to focusing on
marketing, Edisto plans to increase
domestic reserves through development
of existing properties and through
acquisition. Edisto also wants to
expand transportation on its 214-mile
Missouri intrastate pipeline.
         International activities
offshore Tunisia are up for sale,
following the previous sale of onshore
properties in Tunisia and offshore
properties in Malaysia.
         The Multifex International
operations also are up for sale.
Multiflex is a manufacturer and
supplier of hose bundles and subsea
well control umbilicals.
         Edisto acquired an 80% equity
interest in March 1990.

Washington Energy hawks E&P unit

         Washington Energy is
considering selling some of the assets
of its subsidiary Washington Energy
Resources (WER), in an effort to
convert some of the exploration and
production company to cash.
         Washington Energy is also
looking at possible merger
opportunities and a public or private
stock offering. This doesn't mean an
outright sale of WER, a company
spokesperson said. It's an effort to
see what value the marketplace puts on
WER, she explained.
         WER holds reserves of 33.9
million barrels of oil equivalent as of
June 30, and has interests in 248
producing wells. WER holds an equity
interest in additional reserves and
interests in another 45 wells through
its investment in an unconsolidated
affiliate. The company also brokers gas
for third parties and provides gas
management services.
         Washington Energy said its
efforts to monetize WER are unrelated
to a recent rate case which
substantially reduced the annual
revenues of its largest subsidiary,
Washington Natural Gas. Washington
Natural requested a 9.98% overall rate
of return, but the Washington Utilities
and Transportation Commission approved
a rate of 9.15%. As a result,
Washington Natural filed rates last
month to reduce annual revenues by
$16.9 million.
         This also prompted the
Washington Energy board of directors to
reduce the company's quarterly dividend
from 35 cents to 25 cents

New York project gets permits

         After it recently obtained
state and local approvals, U.S.
Generating moved forward with
construction on a natural gas combined-
cycle power plant in Wallkill, N.Y.
         Wallkill Generating, an
affiliate of U.S. Generating, received
environmental permits from the state
Dept. of Environmental Conservation and
approvals from the town of Wallkill
which allow the company to develop the
$150 million plant. The project will
supply 150 MW of power to Orange and
Rockland Utilities and other utilities
in the mid-Hudson region.

El Paso criticizes comments made
about case

         A high-ranking official of El
Paso Natural Gas took issue with
statements last week about allegations
by an independent marketer against the
pipeline.
         Rick Baish, senior vice
president of marketing, rates and
regulation for the pipeline, said he
couldn't comment on charges made by
Windward Energy & Marketing against the
pipeline, Meridian Oil and Burlington
Resources.
         He said the charges  "are
unproven allegations to try to avoid
judgement on the claim that we made
against [Windward] on the money they
owe us. That's pending before a federal
court in Tulsa.
         "It's obviously not pleasant
for us to read about that [in Gas
Daily], but beyond that we had a real
concern that someone ... would think it
appropriate to argue the merits of the
pending case in the newspapers when
it's before a federal judge," Baish
said.
         The stories published in Gas
Markets Week last weekwere taken from
public documents, and the accusers
wouldn't comment to Gas Markets Week on
the case. An attorney's comments
appeared at the end of the story.
         Baish was critical of the
attorney who was quoted anonymously in
the story about Windward's charges. The
attorney said that the gathering issue
was especially ripe since FERC was
considering how to handle gathering
jurisdictionally in the post-Order 636
environment.
         Baish asked that the anonymous
attorney be identified in any future
stories "so your readers can judge for
themselves what that person's agenda
might be." He found the attorney's
statements "grossly offensive."
         He thought the attorney may be
representing someone who would have an
interest in the outcome of the FERC
deliberations on gathering policy. "In
fairness, readers ought to be able to
make their own judgements about what
that person's agenda might be," Baish
said. "I thought what that person said
was entirely improper if not unethical.
I'm hard-pressed to be gentlemanly
about it. I find it hard to understand
how an attorney could make statements
obviously trying to influence FERC
based on allegations that he knew or
should have known [but which] have not
been proven."         MR

Williams introduces electronic gas
trading system

         Williams Energy Ventures
ushered in the new era of electronic
gas trading last week with all the
glitz and glamour that used to be
associated with the oil boom of the
late-1970s.
         The theme of the show was
"It's a jungle out there" in today's
gas trading business. A showroom and
multimedia presentation carried out the
theme with the message that Streamline,
as Williams calls its electronic
system, will turn the jungle into a
master planned community of orderly
trading.
         Unlike the unveiling of the
NYMEX-EnerSoft electronic trading
system on Oct. 20, also in Houston,
several computers had been set up to
demonstrate how buy and sell orders
will be posted, transacted and
nominated to pipelines.
         The few threads laid bare by
the unveiling were caused by
demonstrators who knew far more about
computers than they did about natural
gas trading. While they could dash
around with ease from window to window
in the colorful displays, they couldn't
answer certain detailed questions.
         Industry people attending the
show were forgiving, however, willing
to concede that electronic trading is
the future. As one trader joked to his
group, does this mean he won't able to
hide his big margins any longer?
         Streamline will one day
provide cash discovery at hubs around
the country if it's as successful as
Williams envisions. The system is
available now for installation and
training.
         The first hub, at Carthage in
northeast Texas, is expected to have
enough customers to become operational
by Feb. 1 or by the end of the first
quarter. Carthage ties in to six
interstate and eight intrastate
pipelines that supply 1 billion cfd.
Plus, hub operator East Texas Gas
Systems recently began operating
American Pipeline, which has nearby
interconnects with Natural Gas Pipeline
of America, Tejas Natural Gas (formerly
Exxon Gas Systems) and Texoma/Houston
Pipe Line. East Texas Gas is a
majority-owned affiliate of Union
Pacific Fuels.
         An Intra-Alberta Hub, located
on Nova Pipeline, is scheduled to be in
place early next year. A Westcoast
Energy subsidiary will put that system
on line.         RK

Columbia finds new LNG partner

         To meet the need for
electricity in the Washington, D.C.,
area and comply with the Clean Air Act,
Potomac Electric Power (Pepco) will
join Columbia Gas system in a joint
venture to restart the liquefied
natural gas (LNG) terminal in Cove
Point, Md.
         Columbia LNG and Pepco will
also seek FERC approval this week to
provide peak-day load-shaving services
to local distribution companies
starting with the winter of 1995-1996.
         A pipeline extends from Cove
Point to Loudon, Va. Pepco's interest
in Cove Point is to secure a reliable
and cost-effective source of
transportation to its Chalk Point
generating station via the pipeline.
         Columbia LNG will contribute
the terminal and pipeline in exchange
for an equity interest in the
partnership, and Pepco's subsidiary
will invest up to $25 million in equity
and debt. Pepco's investment will be
used to recommission parts of the
terminal, which has been shut down for
many years, and build a new
liquefaction unit.
         Cove Point, built in the mid-
1970s, is one of four terminals in the
country designed to receive deliveries
of LNG by ship. Currently, only a
terminal in Boston has enough demand to
justify operations.
           At one point last year,
Shell LNG was going to buy Cove Point
from Columbia, but the deal fell
through.

Order 636 didn't startle hedgers

         Order 636 hardly affected the
hedging plans of traders that Gas Daily
talked to this week, and brokers also
reported no changes in customer
activity. But lower temperatures and
more pipeline constraints in the
unbundled environment might have a
pronounced impact later, sources added.
         Spot cash prices have been
shooting up for the past week as fall
turns to early winter. Spot volumes
available for incremental needs seem to
be dwindling. A trader reported a
seller sought, but didn't get, a
December NYMEX equivalent for November
gas at Station 65 into Transcontinental
Gas Pipe Line.
         December futures have been
volatile enough this week for different
brokers to talk about reaching $2.50 or
falling to $2.35. And at times gas
futures seemed to be trading in
sympathy with the rest of the energy
complex on the NYMEX.
         "The Merc will latch on to
whatever it needs to, and now the
strongest thing is cash," a buyer
countered.
         Order 636 went in place for
the bulk of pipelines during a
transition from a weak to strong
futures market, explained Tom Lord of
Morgan Stanley. "How do you sort out
636 from a change in market psychology
in the last two weeks?" he asked.
         Over the medium term, a trader
said "there's the possibility that if
we do get severe weather, there will be
enough uncertainty about supply that we
might get more volatile price spikes
compared to last year."
         With pipeline sales gas gone,
Order 636 changes the way storage is
filled, said a trading manager at a
marketing affiliate. "Wall Street feels
storage is the biggest factor in the
market," he said. "You'll probably see
greater efficiency in the use of
storage, and hedging to make it work."

Injections amounted to bulk of demand in spring

     Gas bought for injection into storage in April and May was the
only thing that propped up prices which would have been well
under $1.50, sources were saying this week.
     Storage injections amounted to the only demand out there, said
one producer. Heating degree days from the end of February
through April were far lower than normal, he said, and this May
hasn't seen any cooling degree days in Texas.
     In April, some sources were wondering if the American Gas
Assn.'s (AGA) estimates showing strong net injections each week
were accurate because prices weren't soaring above $2.00.  One
trader said injections were the only thing that kept April prices up
near $1.90.
     AGA estimated that net injections for the month of April totaled
214 billion cf. That would be a record for April injections, based on
historical data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
See table on page 12. The previous high in net injections was in
April 1985, when net injections were 117 billion cf. This April's
net injections should be well above last April, when net injections
were 112 billion cf.
     April storage data compiled by Gas Storage Report supports the
AGA estimate, and even indicates that net injections may have been
a little higher for the month. Just looking at the 10 largest storage
operators on page 6, net injections total more than 150 billion cf.
With strong injections in April, working gas storage levels are
closer to normal now. Gas Storage Report's ballpark estimate of
working gas in storage at the end of April is about 1,177 billion cf.
     May injections have also been strong, but they may not reach the
record set in last May of 462 billion cf, one storage operator
pointed out. However, one analyst countered that May injections
may come close because distributors and marketers are likely
taking advantage of May prices, especially since June prices should
be higher as demand for air conditioning increases.
     A producer that moves gas on Northern Natural Gas said he
expects June prices to rebound. Distributors on Northern don't
start injecting until June, he said, and that should have an effect on
prices on Northern Natural. He also expects gas demand for air
conditioning in the Southwest to heat up in June. Another reason he
thinks prices are headed up in June is that a number of end-users
were looking to lock up one-year deals in May. " Prices are
probably going to rebound from here."
     One buyer for a pipeline said he isn't counting on a huge
rebound in prices. He said last year was an anomaly because the
LDCs were trying to lock up long-term supplies to back up their
transportation contracts after the pipelines restructured.
Producers were taking spot gas off the market to offer under firm
contracts, and at the same time, large amounts of gas were going into
storage, he said. That all combined to keep prices over $2.00 in
April and May, he added.

EIA revises data to reflect NGPL reclassification

     The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has revised its
aggregate storage volumes for January through July of 1993 to
reflect the changes that Natural Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL)
made to its working gas volumes due to reclassification.
     In August 1993, NGPL received FERC approval to reclassify a
portion of its working gas to base gas for accounting purposes. The
pipeline filed revised FERC Form 8s and EIA Form 191s back to
November 1992. The reclassifications also reflect the operational
levels of the pipeline's working gas, NGPL said.
     EIA's monthly storage table on page 9 shows the changes in
working gas and base gas for 1993. An EIA official explained that
1992 doesn't include the changes because the agency had already
issued final numbers for 1992.
     Most of the changes resulted in a shift of about 215 billion cf of
working gas into the base gas column. With these revisions, EIA's
monthly numbers for 1994 are more comparable to last year's. The
only reclassifications that would have to be factored in are for
Southern Natural Gas and KN Interstate Gas.
     The agency also revised its January and February 1994 storage
figures, as well as releasing actual data for March. January's
working gas level of 1,578 billion cf is almost 40 billion cf less
than what EIA initially reported for January.
     With those revisions, the American Gas Assn.'s estimates from
January and February move closer to EIA's actual figures. AGA's
working gas estimate for the week ending Jan. 28 was 1,624 billion
cf. AGA's working gas estimate for the week ending Feb. 25 was
1,074 billion cf, compared to EIA's final February working gas
level of 1,089 billion cf.
     While AGA's estimates are still somewhat lower than EIA's
numbers, they are much closer after the EIA revisions than they
were in the winter. One storage tracker said a number of people
were questioning the accuracy of AGA's January and February
numbers in the winter, but " after all is said and done, they'll
prove pretty good."
     In fact, this source said, " AGA's estimates are doing what they
were meant to do: Gauging storage activity over a week."  For a look
at AGA's most recent estimates, see the table at right.
     Working gas in storage at the end of March was 957 billion cf,
the data show, which brings working gas in line with last March's
levels, when the two reclassifications are considered.
     March had injections of 105 billion cf and withdrawals of 239
billion cf, for net withdrawals of 133 billion cf, EIA said. The net
withdrawals for the month were much lower than past Marchs' net
withdrawals. March 1993 saw heavy net withdrawals of 303 billion
cf due to the " storm of the century"  that hit the eastern half of the
country.
     Those heavy withdrawals brought March 1993 working gas to
1,028 billion cf, according to the revised data which include's
NGPL's reclassification, the lowest March level in 12 years. This
past March's working gas would be about the same if the
unaccounted-for reclassifications, i.e., Southern Natural and KN
Interstate, are factored into the 957 billion cf. Adding Southern
Natural's reclassification of about 21 billion cf and KN's shifting of
55 billion cf, working gas would be 1,033 billion cf. That's 5
billion cf more than March 1993.

American operates unique single complex facility

     Behind the WesTex gas storage facility's novel approach to
combined cavern storage, vertical well reservoir storage and
horizontal well reservoir storage is American Gas Storage's
determination to provide customers with greater market access and
high deliverability service.
     At the recent American Gas Assn. operations conference, Jay
Evans, American Oil & Gas' manager of reservoir engineering,
described American's planning and construction involved to
develop the first gas storage complex to integrate cavern and
reservoir storage.
     The WesTex facility, located in Gaines County, Texas, about 60
miles southwest of Lubbock, plans to offer section 311 service.
American is close to filing a FERC application, said James Lytal,
vice president of business development.
     WesTex consists of three fields:
     %  Salado Gas Storage Project, a bedded salt cavern with 3 billion
cf of working gas capacity. This is the first facility in the United
States constructed in bedded salt exclusively for the storage of
natural gas.
     %  Loop Gas Storage, a vertical well reservoir with 9.4 billion cf
of working gas.
     %  North Felmac Gas Storage, a horizontal well reservoir with 5.6
billion cf of working gas.
     As integrated into one facility, WesTex will have working gas
capacity of 18 billion cf and withdrawal capability of 600 million
cfd and an injection capability of 300 million cfd, Evans said in his
presentation. But Lytal said the working gas capacity may be a
little less depending on the services provided to customers. Direct
WesTex pipeline interconnects allow receipts and deliveries with
El Paso Natural Gas, Northern Natural Gas and Red River Pipeline.
     Lytal said American expects to offer about 7 billion cf of
working gas and 200 million cfd of maximum withdrawal capacity
under seasonal storage service; 5 billion cf of working gas and 140
million cfd of maximum withdrawal capacity under the firm
enhanced seasonal service; and a peaking service from the salt
cavern. The first 1 billion cf of working gas in the cavern should be
in service in November, he said.
     Evans described the capacity of each field and how it was
converted to storage.
     He explained that bedded salt is found throughout much of the
Permian Basin of West Texas, and specifically, the Midland section
of the Permian contains up to 900 feet of gross salt. Evans said the
caverns were constructed in the lower " dirty"  section of the
Permian Salado Salt beds. Well tests indicated that salt caverns
could be constructed in the beds as an acceptable container for
natural gas.
     " The acreage was presently being used for gas storage in the
depleted Loop Yates reservoir, so the existing injection and
withdrawal facilities would be used to handle surface gas
operations,"  Evans said.
     Three cavern wells have been completed and are presently being
solution mined. The first cavern well was converted to gas storage
in November 1993, but was placed back into the solution mining
mode in February 1994, Evans said.
     American started injections into the first cavern in November
1993 at a rate of 60 million cfd. A total of 550 million cf of gas was
injected up to Dec. 6, 1993. Evans said a ledge fall and subsequent
shearing of the tubing string prevented complete fill-up of the
cavern. The cavern was used for storage and injections and
withdrawals up to Feb. 12, 1994, and then returned to solution
mining mode in anticipation of total completion in November 1994.
     Loop is a converted depleted reservoir in the Yates Sand at 3,350
feet. The field produced 12.24 billion cf of gas from a reservoir
containing 13.25 billion cf. The field was converted to storage
operations in 1981 with the addition of six new wells, the
workovers of four existing production wells and compression and
metering facilities, Evans said. The facility exhibited a total
working gas capacity of 4 billion cf at that time, he said.
     American performed a reservoir evaluation of the storage field
to resolve the discrepancies between what the facility exhibited as
expected storage operations and the past history of primary
depletion performance.
     " After numerous simulation runs of the primary and storage
performance operations, a validated working model of the reservoir
emerged. It was determined that the storage field actually contained
two separate reservoirs, which were separated by a four-foot low
permeability layer,"  Evans reported.
     American expanded the facilities in 1991-92 by drilling and
completing 16 new injection/withdrawal wells and workover of eight
original wells. The company added metering and dehydration
facilities to handle the increased volumes. The facility now has 9.4
billion cf of working gas capacity and the withdrawal capability is
200 million cf, up from 50 million cfd.
     This is a reservoir facility in the depleted Felmac (Yates) field.
During primary depletion, the 3,360-feet Yates Sand produced 8.4
billion cf of the 9.24 billion cf capacity. Evans said only one of the
original producing wells exists. American converted the well to a
pressure observation well.
     American performed a numerical simulation study of the field to
determine the most economic development plan for converting the
field to storage. Both vertical and horizontal well completions were
considered while evaluating storage performance, Evans said. The
analysis determined that the most effective and economic
development of the field was by using horizontal well technology.
     Specifically, two in-line horizontal wells with a wellbore
diameter of 6 and 1/2 inches and an open hole extension of 2,000
feet were recommended, Evans said. " It was determined from the
numerical simulation results that the storage reservoir would have
working gas volume of 5.6 billion cf and a withdrawal capacity of
200 million cf,"  he reported.
     The company drilled the first horizontal well in October 1993 at
a vertical depth of 3,500 feet. The well had a horizontal
displacement of 500 feet at 90 degrees and it was drilled
horizontally to a total of 2,000 feet. The facility has a withdrawal
capability of 140 million cfd and an injection capacity of 150
million cfd. Injection of gas began in March at a rate of 50 million
cfd, Evans said.
     American decided to integrate the facilities into a single
complex to provide greater market flexibility and access. The
company tied in gas piping, measurement, dehydration, control and
compression from each of the subject projects. American also
constructed a 22-mile, 20-inch pipeline to the Red River Pipeline.

Entre to develop first offshore gas storage field

     Independent producer Entre Energy plans to develop the first
underground natural gas storage facility located entirely in
offshore waters.
      Entre filed an application with FERC earlier this month to
convert an existing gas producing reservoir located in the
Chandeleur area, Block 29, offshore Louisiana, into the Chandeleur
storage facility. The proposed facility will have an initial working
capacity of about 26 billion cf and injection/withdrawal rates of
300 million cfd, Entre said. The company bought the Chandeleur
block from Chevron in early 1993.
     The facility could be expanded to an ultimate working gas
capacity of 75 billion cf and injection/withdrawal rates of 850
million cfd. The field connects to Texas Eastern Transmission's
East Louisiana (ELA) pipeline system.
     One source said Entre's location is a good one, even though the
Louisiana storage market is competitive. The source said Texas
Eastern customers that take no-notice service from the pipeline
have to pay it back within 48 hours at ELA or pay a penalty. In the
winter, this often pushes prices up pretty high in ELA, the source
said. Customers could replace no-notice with a storage service.
     Entre has proposed a market-based rate structure in its FERC
application. The company is presently negotiating agreements with
customers for long-term contract storage service. Entre will also
host an open season for available capacity, said Stephen Kelly, vice
president of Entre.
     Kelly said the company plans to form a marketing subsidiary to
aggressively market the facility.
     The facility should be offering limited service for the 1994-95
winter season, assuming FERC approves Entre's application by mid-
summer. TCW Asset Management has provided the principal
acquisition and conversion financing for the project. Kelly said the
offshore reservoir is no different to convert to a storage reservoir
than one onshore. They both use the same technology to convert.

ANR seeks rehearing on market-based rate plan

     ANR Pipeline has repackaged its argument that it lacks market
power in its request for rehearing on FERC's decision to reject the
pipeline's market-based pilot programs.
     ANR challenges the commission's finding in ANR's rate case that
the pipeline " failed to file data demonstrating that it lacks market
power in the relevant markets (GSR 3/94)."  ANR says it has
presented in its rate filing the rationale for its three market-based
rate proposals and the rationale meets the standards for
determining market power.
     The pipeline points out in its rehearing request that it has made
three proposals for market-based rates on three different services.
" The appropriate evidence for meeting a market power test is
different for each ANR proposal and furthermore varies from the
evidence that was appropriate in some instances where the
commission has approved market-based pricing,"  ANR says.
     The three proposals seeking market-based rates are limited and
conditioned, the pipeline says. One proposal is for declined
transportation capacity, which refers to any firm transportation
contracts that an existing customer declines to renew. ANR would
post the available capacity on its electronic bulletin board and if it
receives no bids at the maximum rate, it could then attempt to
charge market-based, negotiated rates.
     The second proposal is for any new storage services, which
means services that become available after existing contracts
expire. The third proposal is for released transportation capacity
and it would allow customers with firm transportation capacity to
release it at market-based rates.
     ANR stresses that it hasn't proposed to change its basic
unbundled services, and all its open-access services are now, and
will continue to be, cost-based in its tariff. ANR's proposals for
market-based pricing are limited to three " narrowly prescribed"
circumstances, in which ANR either lacks market power or would
provide protective conditions of service, the pipeline says.
     The pipeline also argues that no single test applies to market
power analyses. ANR contends its three proposals satisfy a relevant
threshold test of lack of market power when the three proposals are
considered separately, and all definitions and conditions are
considered. For instance, ANR says it has 0% of the market in its
market for new storage services, because there are no customers for
these new services yet, so the customers can't be captive to ANR.
ANR adds that plenty of alternatives to its new storage services
already exist.
     Also in its filing, ANR requested rehearing on the commission's
order to the pipeline to eliminate its optional repackaged
transportation and gathering service. The pipeline argues that it
offers an unbundled transportation service without embedded
gathering costs and it also offers this repackaged bundled
transportation and gathering service. " By offering both the
unbundled and repackaged service options, ANR has satisfied both
commission policies of unbundling and maximizing shipper
options,"  ANR says (RP94-43-003).

Alberta Energy to expand storage at hub

     Alberta Energy plans to expand the AECO-C Hub natural gas
storage facility by 500 million cfd of withdrawal capacity and 25
billion cf of reservoir capacity, or 38.5% more than the storage unit
can hold and deliver now.
     On completion of the expansion, withdrawal capacity will be 1.8
billion cfd, or about 13% of Canadian daily wellhead capacity. Total
working storage would be 90 billion cf.
     Alberta Energy President and CEO Gwyn Morgan said the
company currently is soliciting expressions of interest from
potential customers. " Because of our low incremental costs, we are
able to provide our customers with high-quality service at
competitive rates,"  he said. " Our studies indicate that daily
storage requirements within Alberta could be as high as 3 billion
cf, and AECO-C has further potential to meet those needs."
     A portion of the $40 million expansion at the Suffield, Alberta,
facility would be available for the upcoming winter season. The full
expansion will be operational by April 1995. Potential clients are
being asked to confirm their interest by June 15, 1994.
     Morgan said the expansion is part of Alberta Energy's growth
strategy and is consistent with decisions taken by the company to
participate in the Ten Section Hub in Bakersfield, Calif., through
its Alenco Resources subsidiary and to list AECO-C Hub on the
NYMEX trading network.

Changing industry means team approach to development is needed

     The growing competition in the natural gas storage industry, and
the need for technology transfer to develop facilities, will make the
team approach to storage development a necessity, say two Union
Gas officials.
     " Competition among utilities and others for additional storage
has resulted in the need to become proactive in pursuing
development alternatives,"  say William Fay, manager of storage
projects for Union Gas, and James Egden, Union's manager of
geology. Fay presented their paper at the American Gas Assn.'s
operations conference in San Francisco earlier this month.
     In addition, they say, costs to develop storage have increased as
the better-quality reservoirs have already been developed.
Deregulation of the gas industry has also changed the marketplace,
and utilities are realizing they need to develop markets external to
their franchise areas, Fay and Egden say. More and more, utilities
are turning to storage and transportation, they add.
     " To meet these changes, multi-disciplinary teams have become a
necessity within the new market environment,"  the officials stress.
     The concept behind multi-disciplinary teams is for a company to
empower workers on the team with the tools to make the necessary
decisions. This eliminates time-consuming meetings where
management officials are filled in on technical details about a
project so they can make decisions. The tools consist of the goals,
restrictions and parameters -- especially financial -- of a project.
Within this framework, the team can make all of the pertinent
decisions on the project, Fay told Gas Storage Report. " As long as
they are moving toward the goals, there shouldn't be a problem,"  he
said.
     The multi-disciplinary teams that Union has used have grown to
include external service companies and consultants from the
planning stages through the final project evaluation, Fay said. "
Evolution of the team approach has resulted in faster, more cost
effective and detailed project completions,"  Fay and Egden say in
their report.
     But, they warn, Union's transition to the team approach wasn't
necessarily a smooth one since changes were being made in " an
extremely traditional and conservative environment."
     Fay says companies moving to the team approach to project
development probably can expect some resistance from upper
management. That is not unusual, he says, since most organizations
have traditionally operated in a hierarchical-type, filter-down
manner. Senior management may feel they are losing control, Fay
says. The key is to ease senior management's concerns by keeping
senior officials in the loop throughout the life of the project, he
says.
     " You may need to do a number of projects to convince them that
this system works,"  Fay says. Once senior officials see that costs
were kept under control and less time is spent on meetings and
decisions, they'll consider multi-disciplinary teams a benefit, he
adds.
     Fay says the team approach is still evolving at Union and is far
from complete. However, he presented case studies that show some
improvements in communication and time using the team approach.
For one thing, in the past, two central departments in the
development of storage projects, geology and storage planning,
reported to separate vice presidents. " Focus on these two groups
was significantly different resulting in poor communication and
conflicting corporate objectives,"  Fay and Egden say.
     As the regulatory environment changed, companies were
required to file reports with regulatory agencies, which also were
holding more formal hearings. Union realized it would need to
improve communication between the geology and storage planning
departments. The utility restructured so that geology, reservoir
services, storage planning and storage administration all fell under
the storage development department.
     " The emergence of the storage development department was an
attempt to provide a team environment,"  the authors say. From
there, multi-disciplinary teams for individual projects could be
formed, they add.
     Fay says he sees team development growing in the future since
most new storage projects will consist of partnerships made up of
two or more companies. He said the recent announcements of hub
development are examples of partnerships in the development and
ownership of storage projects.
     However, Fay suggests that companies beware of the pitfalls of
teams, or what he calls " the growing pains of moving from a
traditional way of operation."  First of all, senior management may
resist. Also, team members may be prone to second-guessing
decisions. Another issue is the need for more training of
employees. Employees need to be trained both technically and in
the team approach, Fay says, and that can be costly.
     Finally, he says, the team approach may not work for all
projects. " If the company doesn't know what its goal is, then that is
not a good place for a team,"  he says.

Potential Indiana storage project considers hub

     A potential storage project in Indiana is getting noticed lately as
its developers have been divulging bits and pieces about it at
conferences.
     The Blackhawk field in Vigo County, Ind., is an aquifer field that
owner Hamilton Natural Gas has been shopping around as a
potential storage facility, sources say. Hamilton officials didn't
return phone calls by press time.
     Indianapolis-based Hamilton bought the field from Texas Gas
Transmission in 1989 for $300,000, according to papers made
available at recent natural gas conferences. Based on early tests by
Texas Gas and Hamilton's tests of the Blackhawk field, the company
determined the field is ready to be developed as a " good storage
field,"  the papers said.
     Sources said five or six pipelines are in the vicinity of the field,
including Texas Gas, Texas Eastern Transmission and Midwestern
Gas. The field is located about 13 miles southeast of Terre Haute,
Ind. Sources also said they think Hamilton is trying to get a direct
connect into Texas Gas.
     The papers say total delivered gas from the field will be 5.275
billion cf over a 120-day withdrawal cycle. That averages about 44
million cfd. The injection cycle will be for 209 days maximum, the
handouts indicate.
     Not surprisingly, Hamilton has talked about developing
Blackhawk into a hub, a couple of sources said. With its proximity
to a handful of pipelines, it can serve the Midwest market area, they
said. Another source added that the success of Northern Illinois
Gas' Chicago Hub may also be contributing to the hub talk.

Richfield requests waiver of an EBB standard

     Richfield Gas Storage Systems has asked FERC for an exemption
from the provision of Order 563 that requires interstate operators
to provide electronic file downloading (EDI) on their electronic
bulletin boards (EBBs).
     As part of Order 636, the commission required interstate
pipelines to set up EBBs to facilitate the trading of capacity by
shippers. Order 563 requires pipelines to provide standardized
information about service on their systems. Interstates must
comply with Order 563 by June 1.
     Richfield, a small interstate storage operator in Kansas, points
out that the commission stated it will allow for small pipelines to
be exempt from portions of 563. Richfield seeks partial exemption
or a waiver of the requirement to provide EDI because it is a small
company and its storage field is fully subscribed under long-term
contracts.
     Further, Richfield says, it provides transportation only in
conjunction with its storage service. Since Richfield's small
pipeline system and storage field are located in Stevens and Morton
counties, Kansas, they aren't an integral link in the movement of
gas through interstate commerce, the company said.
     Richfield says that in its first year of service, it has received no
customer messages on its EBB and no inquiries on it concerning
service. No customers have offered to release their storage capacity,
although it isn't surprising since the market for storage is more
long-term than transportation, Richfield says.
     " Computer communication capability is not necessary or even
necessarily desirable on Richfield's small system, especially since
Richfield's storage service is provided at confidential, market-
based negotiated rates,"  the company said in its filing.
     Finally, Richfield argues that the cost to comply with EDI is "
prohibitively expensive."  The company said its EBB operator has
determined that EDI will cost $400 per month in addition to the
$200 per month cost to upgrade the EBB as required by Order 563.
Richfield said it can't pass these costs on to customers because it
has market-based rates already in place with customers.
     The National Registry of Capacity Rights has filed a motion to
intervene, asking FERC to grant a 120-waiver while it holds a
technical conference on the issue. The registry would like Richfield
to come up with an alternative to EDI which would allow shippers to
receive capacity release information through files they can
download (RP94-235).

SoCal to provide storage to off-system customer

     Southern California Gas will provide storage service to
Washington Water Power's new peaking power plant in Rathdrum,
Idaho.
     The California Public Utilities Commission approved the six-
year contract, which calls for SoCal to provide firm inventory of
480 million cf, with injection on an as-available basis.
     Washington Water will pay an intrastate transportation rate of
22.5 cents/dth upon injection and no transportation charge upon
withdrawal. Gas withdrawn from storage will be redelivered to the
plant in the upper panhandle of Idaho via backhaul on the Pacific
Gas & Electric/Pacific Gas Transmission system.
     Washington Water Power isn't new to natural gas storage. It is a
co-owner of the Jackson Prairie storage facility in Washington,
which is operated by co-owner Washington Natural Gas. Northwest
Pipeline is also a part owner of the facility.
     The CPUC approval on this contract is consistent with the
commission's ruling on an earlier agreement between SoCal and
Southwest Gas. The commission told SoCal it had to include a
transportation rate in its storage service to Southwest since its
original agreement didn't have a transportation charge in it.
     For independent storage operators the one-way transportation
charge could prove to be a competitive challenge. Some interstate
independents have complained that pipelines that charge only once
for gas to and from storage make it difficult for independents to
compete.

Officials see storage release market down the road

     The storage capacity release market is a huge opportunity for
the industry, said a marketer at the American Gas Assn.'s (AGA)
annual operations conference here earlier this month.
     Kevin O'Toole, vice president of transportation for marketer
Catex/Vitol, said there is a " monstrous market"  for storage
capacity releases and swapping even though only a few deals have
been done. O'Toole pointed to Northern Illinois Gas' Chicago Hub as
an example of where swapping would be effective.
     Richard Rushton, general manager of gas storage for NIGas, said
his company is approaching storage capacity releases cautiously. "
We won't be real aggressive,"  he said, because the Illinois
Commerce Commission has determined that ratepayers should share
the benefits of the hub, but shareholders will assume the risks.
     Another speaker on the panel, Steve Schoening, manager of load
and supply for Wisconsin Natural Gas, said Wisconsin Natural is
still looking to lease storage " close enough to home"  so it could
eliminate the need to nominate transportation from storage on a
pipeline. So far, the LDC has been unsuccessful because the closest
storage is in Illinois or Michigan.
     The panel members discussed how the industry operated this
winter under Order 636 and extreme weather. The panel praised the
industry's successful effort and communication this past winter,
but they also said communication needs to improve in order to make
sure the natural gas system can meet future challenges.
     Distributors need to have a contact at the pipelines to call who
can give them the capacity information they need right away,
Rushton said. He explained that NIGas encountered that problem
this past January when it was trying to find out how much capacity
was flowing on the pipelines that service it.
     Rushton said it turned out that often there was only one person
at the pipeline who could give the distributor capacity information
and by the time that person got back to NIGas, it was midday. Also,
he urged pipelines and suppliers to find a better mechanism for
securing supplies on the weekends. Some of January's coldest days
in NIGas' northern Illinois service area fell right on the weekends.
     Schoening agreed, saying LDCs still need to be able to pick up
the phone and talk to someone, no matter how good a pipeline's EBB
is. He said pipelines need to understand the problems LDCs have
with nominating a day ahead of time.
     John Kelly, director of transmission technical services for
Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line, defended pipelines' efforts, pointing
out that " communication is a two-way street."  He said there are
other elements of the industry that need to keep in touch, not just
pipelines and LDCs, but marketers and producers as well. In
addition, customers need to keep pipelines abreast of what they are
doing with their storage volumes so the pipelines can keep track of
volumes and supplies.
     Kelly added that pipelines' bulletin boards will only improve as
they move toward electronic data interchange and they work closely
with customers. Rushton and Schoening agreed that all the tools
weren't in place this winter and the system still managed to operate
effectively. But the system needs to improve, and communication is
the key, Rushton said.

LDC wants gathering line added to Jackson Prairie

     Washington Natural Gas has asked FERC to let it amend an
earlier application to expand its Jackson Prairie storage facility so
it can add a 4,800-foot gathering line.
     The company explained that the gathering line is needed to
relieve a shortfall in the anticipated delivery capability that the
expansion project was going to add. Washington Natural expected
that its expansion would bring seasonal working gas to 15.1 billion
cf, an increase of 2.3 billion cf. The work would also increase the
firm delivery rate to 450 million cfd. The expansion work was
expected to cost a total of about $4.4 million.
     FERC approved Washington Natural's application in a March
1991 order that allows the utility to do well recompletions on six
wells, add two dehydration and two cooling towers and a metering
station. Washington Natural has determined that the well workovers
didn't result in the projected increase in deliverability that it had
anticipated.
     Due to this performance shortfall, the project cannot achieve the
certificated seasonal working gas quantity of 15.1 billion cf, the
distributor said. That leads to a difference between the certificated
contract demand level and the actual withdrawal rate that can be
achieved at the facility.
     Washington Natural says it can fix this shortfall and bring the
expansion project's performance up to its certificated capacity
level by constructing a 4,800-foot, 16-inch gathering line. The
construction is expected to cost $655,000 which the three owners of
Jackson Prairie will bear. The other owners of the facility are
Northwest Pipeline and Washington Water Power.
     The gathering lines will connect some of the existing wells with
the compressor station and will reduce the pressures against which
the withdrawal wells have to work during the withdrawal cycle. "
This arrangement will effectively increase the deliverability of the
withdrawal wells,"  Washington Natural contends (CP94-534).

Design problems for existing cavern and bedded salt cavern
construction

     By Michel Dussaud
     Gas storage in salt caverns is becoming popular as evidenced by
the fact that many of the new gas storage projects, 16 out of 40, or
40%, are in salt caverns. A larger percentage of these new storage
caverns will be converted from existing caverns to storage (40% of
new projects), and more caverns, about 25% of new projects, will be
in bedded salt. This is due to the search for the best location with
regard to pipeline interconnects, especially in the market area,
where no domal salt is available. Also, competition among storage
developers is contributing to the popularity of salt cavern
construction.
     Most of the existing gas storage facilities in salt caverns in the
United States and Canada are in salt domes, with only 15% of them
in bedded salt. A few of the existing gas storage caverns, 20%, are
converted brine or liquid storage caverns. Only one of these
converted caverns is in bedded salt.
     The industry may find it more economically attractive to convert
an existing cavern into storage than developing a new cavern.
However, the storage industry is facing new problems of design in
two areas:
     %  How to convert existing caverns safely and efficiently.
     %  How to develop safe and economic gas storage caverns in
bedded salt.
     Salt caverns may be developed by conventional mining
techniques or by solution mining for the purpose of salt extraction.
They also may be developed to store liquids. When considering a
conversion project, some problems have to be carefully addressed
because these caverns were not initially designed for this purpose.
     The first problem is the tightness of the wells connecting the
cavern with the surface. In the case of conventional salt mine, it is
even more critical. Internal and external (cement bond) tightness
must be checked and the usual procedure is the Mechanical
Integrity Test (MIT) using nitrogen. An apparent leak rate of 250
bbls/year (bottom hole conditions) is generally accepted for gas
caverns. However, a more lenient requirement is usually accepted
for brine production or liquid storage, such as 500-1,000
bbls/year.
     Second, the problem of roof span and roof protection needs to be
addressed. It is common to develop caverns with a very extended
flat roof when producing brine in order to maximize the extracted
salt, especially when the cavern is developed by using a two- or
multi-well technique. In most cases, the brine producer owns the
surface, and no third party is affected in case of a partial roof
collapse resulting in subsidence or even sinkhole formation. In the
case of bedded salt, salt may be solution mined at the roof of the
cavern for the same purpose of maximizing salt extraction, and no
protection is left, leaving the cap rock exposed to the cavern
content.
     These two circumstances may be very dangerous for gas storage.
If the roof span is too large, more gas will have to be kept in the
cavern at the end of withdrawal to maintain cavern stability. If no
salt is left at the roof of the cavern to maintain a barrier and avoid
cap rock exposure, then a lower maximum pressure may be required
to mitigate migration risk.
     Communication between caverns or migration out of the cavern is
a third problem. This may happen when the solution mining process
has not been very well controlled. Then, dissolution abnormalities
may occur, especially at the roof if the blanket material level has
not been well monitored. This may also result from the presence of
a potash seam, for example, which may be dissolved even with salt
saturated brine. Caverns may then communicate through such a
channel which is sometimes very difficult to see by sonar. The same
circumstance can also make the cavern communicate with the
outside of the dome, or with the cap rock in the case of bedded salt.
Such risks are sometimes very difficult to identify and quantify.
Pressure testing is not, in most cases, sensitive enough to detect a
small leak outside the cavern, especially with large caverns.
     Fourth, cavern separation sometimes may not be large enough for
gas storage. Again, because the brine producer's objective is to
extract as much salt as possible, and because brine caverns are
maintained at a relatively constant pressure resulting from the
weight of a brine column, they may use a small separation between
caverns. When converting these caverns into gas storage, higher
minimum pressures may be needed so as not to maintain cavern
stability or control creep closure.
     Finally, in some instances, when contemplating a bedded salt
cavern conversion, the problem is to use the space left between the
rubble in the cavern, when salt is very impure. Depending on the
rubble size and nature, dewatering this part of the cavern may not
be feasible.
     Designing caverns in bedded salt requires addressing some
specific points as well. The first point is the aspect ratio, defined
as the ratio of the cavern height to maximum diameter. It is usually
acknowledged that an oval-shaped cavern, or one with an arc-shaped
roof with an aspect ratio close to one, are the most stable. When this
ratio becomes lower than one, the vertical component of stress is
reduced at the roof of the cavern. Ultimately, it may become
negative, which means that the rock above the cavern is then
subjected to vertical tension. However, even weak vertical
compression may endanger cap rock stability. This situation may
occur with large caverns with extended flat roofs and weak cap
rock. Then, a higher minimum pressure is required to maintain
cavern stability, and more base gas has to be used.
     In some bedded salt layers, there are in situ stresses which are
non isotropic. For instance, because of tectonic thrust, the
horizontal component of the stress may be 5-20% more than the
vertical component. This must be taken into account when designing
the storage cavern. Usually, a higher minimum pressure will be
required.
     Insolubles can be a problem as well. If insoluble content is too
high, for instance above 20%, this may make cavern construction
infeasible, because the pile of rubble will take all the space
developed by salt dissolution. If there are massive and thick
insoluble layers within the salt bed to be dissolved, this also can
make the cavern difficult or unfit to construct.
     Finally, if no salt is left at the roof of the cavern and the cap
rock is exposed to gas under pressure, it is very important to
evaluate cap rock tightness to gas, and identify potential gas traps
or loss zones in permeable horizons above the cavern.
     In conclusion, most of the projects involving cavern conversion
or bedded salt cavern construction are probably feasible provided
the relevant problems are carefully addressed during the design
stage. Some principles of design for underground excavation have
been given by Professor Bieniawski from Pennsylvania State
University. Two of these principles are particularly suited to
storage cavern design. The first of these is the principle of
minimum uncertainty. All parameters relevant to the design must
be properly evaluated. If one can't be assessed properly, such as a
small migration path out of the cavern not seen by sonar and not
easily detected by pressure testing, then the corresponding risk
can't be controlled. The second principle to consider is the state-
of-the-art design. If extrapolating beyond the usual way of design
is needed for a project, then this move must be evaluated carefully
in order to check if the usual assumptions made are still valid.

Amoco Canada adds partners to planned storage hub

     TransCanada PipeLines and Alberta Natural Gas have bought into
Amoco Canada Petroleum's storage project as the companies have
teamed up to create a major new natural gas storage hub near
Calgary.
     The Amoco storage project is estimated to cost close to $80
million and is scheduled to come on line Nov. 1.
     TransCanada will take 40% and Alberta Natural will get 20% of
the project as a result of a joint venture announced by the three
Calgary companies. Amoco retains a 40% share and will continue in
its role as operator of the project, which will store 40 billion cf.
The companies will set up a separate business to oversee the
facility.
     The storage facility is being developed near Amoco's East
Crossfield natural gas plant, about 20 miles north of Calgary. It is
situated between TransCanada's mainline east and Alberta
Natural's mainline west. The project is expected to compete with
Alberta Energy's AECO-C Hub near Medicine Hat, Alberta.
     Although the Amoco storage facility will offer less storage
capacity than Alberta Energy, the project's organizers think it will
provide them with an advantage in the increasingly competitive
storage market. The facility will allow the owners to provide better
service to their customers, TransCanada said.
     TransCanada is also a partner in the Washington 10 storage
project in southeast Michigan. That project is awaiting regulatory
approval.

PG&E storage decision delayed

     The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decided at its
May 4 meeting to hold off on a decision on Pacific Gas & Electric's
(PG&E) unbundled storage program until May 25.
     The commission is reviewing PG&E's plan and a preliminary
decision from an administrative law judge (ALJ) (GSR 4/94). PG&E's
storage program proposal unbundles storage capacity into its
separate functions and it would allow customers to contract for the
separate services.
     The ALJ recommended for the 1994-95 season that 150 million
cfd of injection capacity and 32.1 billion cf of inventory be
available to core customers, just as PG&E requested. The ALJ
suggested the utility make available to the core 1,055 million cfd of
withdrawal capacity, somewhat less than the 1,235 million cfd that
the utility requested.
     Another major issue the CPUC will decide is whether the core or
noncore customers should get expanded capacity at PG&E's main
storage facility, McDonald Island.
     The decision on PG&E's plan also affects the utility's electric
fuels department's request for proposals on storage service. Some of
the proposals, including that by PG&E's gas group, will be affected
by the CPUC decision, an official had said previously.

Market molecules

     %  Arkla Energy Resources, now NorAm Gas Transmission, told
its shippers earlier this month that it is nearing maximum
injection rates into storage. The pipeline once again reminded
shippers to make sure their physical supplies match their markets.
Also, the pipeline won't be able to accept any incremental supplies
without matching physical markets until the system oversupply is
resolved.
     %  During June, Natural Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL) said it
won't be able to schedule more than 30% of the total firm storage
rights, including no-notice rights, from points sourced on the
Amarillo system. NGPL anticipates that interruptible storage
injections from Amarillo sources will remain at zero. If June is
similar to May, NGPL expects about 300 million cfd of Amarillo-
sourced injections would be unable to be scheduled.
     %  Columbia Gas Transmission said until further notice, it can't
accept storage in transit, SIT, injections on weekends or holidays.
SIT injections can only be made on weekdays.
     %  Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline offers a discounted
summer storage program. The interruptible service allows
injections from April 1 through Sept. 30, and all gas must be out of
storage by March 31, 1995. The rate for storage only is 12.5
cents/dth and with transportation, the rate is 42 cents. For more
information, call John Childers, transportation services manager, at
701-221-1254.
     %  Northwest Pipeline encouraged shippers to keep imbalances as
close to zero as possible since its balance at the Jackson Prairie
storage facility, of which it is a co-owner, is near its maximum
allowable level. Also, the pipeline doesn't have relief at Questar's
Clay Basin storage facility, where Northwest leases space, to
increase injections there.
     %  NorAm Gas Transmission is the new name of Arkla Energy
Resources. The company received FERC approval to change its name.
NorAm says the name more accurately reflects the regions it
operates in. The tables on pages 6 and 7 reflect the change.
Affiliate Mississippi River Transmission hasn't changed.
     %  Natural Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL) is asking FERC for
permission to modify its S-1 rate schedule so it can provide
interruptible no-notice injection rights to balance actual takes at
NGPL's delivery points. As S-1 is presently written, S-1 isn't
available on a no-notice basis to balance actual takes during the
injection period, May 1 through Oct. 31. NGPL's S-1 shippers said
they would like to be able to use S-1 and S-2 to inject gas to help
balance a delivery point when the actual takes at that point are less
than the confirmed delivery nominations.

Enron files for section 311 service

     Enron Storage last month filed for FERC approval to provide
section 311 service from its Napoleonville storage facility in
Louisiana.
     Enron also requested market-based rates for the section 311
service, which allows the company to move gas from storage out of
the state of Louisiana.
     Napoleonville is a salt dome facility in Ascension Parish, La.,
with a working gas capacity of 4 billion cf and a maximum
withdrawal rate of 400 million cfd. Enron plans a second phase at
the cavern and it will add 3 billion cf of working gas.
     FERC hasn't yet set a date for hearing on Enron's request for 311
service and market-based rates.

RG&E releases storage on CNG

     Rochester Gas & Electric (RG&E) has released more storage
capacity on CNG Transmission, but not nearly as much as it
released earlier this spring.
     The utility released 720 million cf of storage on CNG at a
withdrawal rate of 12 million cfd. Public Service of North Carolina
picked up all of the capacity for a one-year term from April 1
through March 31, 1995. The demand rate for the transaction is
$1.95/mcf.
     In March, RG&E released a total of 3 billion cf of storage
capacity on CNG Transmission (GSR 4/94). Three companies took the
capacity: Virginia Natural Gas, Washington Gas Light and CNG
Services.
     RG&E said it has released storage capacity because it has taken
transportation capacity on Empire Pipeline, which came on line last
year. This has freed up some of the utility's storage and
transportation capacity which it has released on electronic bulletin
boards.

Cayuta open season nearing end

     The Cayuta Natural Gas Storage project has a few days left in its
open season for available capacity and deliverability from its
planned salt cavern facility in upstate New York.
     The open season closes May 31 on Cayuta, the second project by
the partners of the nearby Avoca Natural Gas Storage. Cayuta is
expected to have a working gas capacity of 2 billion cf in its first
phase and 320 million cfd of withdrawal capability. The second and
third phases will have 2 billion cf and 1 billion cf of capacity
respectively.
     Avoca is willing to negotiate bids and enter into preliminary
agreements with any party interested in the 3 billion cf of capacity
that will be available in the second and third phases.
     For more information, call James Driscoll of J. Makowski,
developing partner of both projects, at 617-720-7678.

Canadian board rejects InterCoastal pipe conversion

     ANR Pipeline won't soon be connecting its system to InterCoastal
Pipe Line's at the Canadian border nor will ANR tie in with
Consumer Gas' Tecumseh storage project.
     The National Energy Board denied InterCoastal Pipe Line's
application to convert a Canadian oil pipeline to gas, which would
have had the capacity to move 133 million cfd of gas to markets in
eastern Canada and the northeast United States.
     ANR Pipeline planned to build almost 12 miles of new pipe to
connect InterCoastal with its system at the border, as well as to
Ontario utility Consumers' Tecumseh Gas Storage project near
Sarnia. Another 12-mile lateral would have extended from the
border to ANR's existing system in Michigan. ANR has an
application for construction of this pipeline at FERC.
     The board said safety concerns prompted its decision. While it
was satisfied with many aspects of InterCoastal's proposal, " the
board had reservations about several features of the detailed
design. These include the integrity of the existing pipe, localized
depth of cover problems, minimum design temperature, hazard
assessment and setback requirements."
     InterCoastal, jointly owned by Interprovincial Pipe Line (IPL)
and ANR, planned to convert about 130 miles of existing crude oil
pipeline owned by IPL, which extends from IPL's Sarnia, Ontario,
terminal to a point near Toronto. InterCoastal had signed Consumers
Gas as the project's anchoring customer.

Avoca asks FERC for permission to drill test wells

     Avoca Natural Gas Storage has asked FERC for an exemption from
the temporary certificate requirements so the company can install
and test three production and five monitoring wells without
delaying its project.
     The company explained to FERC in its filing that the
Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC), which has jurisdiction
over the withdrawal of water from the river, is requiring Avoca to
provide actual production well data to support its application for
water withdrawal. The Susquehanna commission won't consider test
data, even though Avoca has included the test data in its
application to SRBC, Avoca said.
     Since Avoca isn't authorized to develop and construct production
wells prior to receiving FERC approval on its application, the
company can't drill the wells, it said. This threatens the January
1996 in-service date that Avoca has told customers during
negotiations, especially since the SRBC meets every other month,
Avoca said.
     Avoca has requested the commission grant it an exemption from
the temporary certificate requirements to allow it to construct the
required production wells. The company said it has offered proof
that no additional permanent environmental damage will result
from the construction of the wells (CP94-161).

SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS DISCLOSED FOR OREGON POWER PROJECT

     The gas-supply arrangements for a planned cogeneration facility
in Oregon were among several new transactions disclosed in export-
license applications just filed with the Canadian National Energy
Board.
     Two producer-marketers, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. and Canstates Gas
Marketing, separately requested Canadian government approval to export
a combined total of 35,000 MMBtu/day for use in the Hermiston
Generating Co. L.P. combined-cycle plant to be constructed at
Hermiston, Ore. Chevron U.S.A.'s supply would be acquired from Chevron
Canada Resources Ltd., its north-of-the-border affiliate. Canstates
would buy its gas at wholesale from Home Oil Co. Ltd.
     In other developments, Renaissance Energy Ltd. of Calgary filed
for authorization to sell and export gas to Bay State Gas Co. and Bay
State's parent company, Northern Utilities Inc. of Westborough, Mass.
Also, Western Gas Marketing Ltd. disclosed that it has scored a new
transborder deal with the Michigan Gas Utilities unit of UtiliCorp
United Inc.
     Officials with Hermiston Generating did not respond to requests
for information. However, a project description submitted to the NEB
says it consists of two side-by-side combustion turbines that will
utilize gas as their primary fuel.

Big new plant

     The plant's nominal primary output will be 300 Mw, divided
equally between the two combustion units. Hermiston submitted a copy
of a long-term agreement to sell electric power produced by the plant
to PacifiCorp, an electric utility based in Portland, Ore.
     A source familiar with the project says as of now, it is not
intended to be a "qualifying facility" cogenerator for purposes of the
Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act; however, the source says, a
local agricultural-products company will purchase waste energy from
the plant.
     The Feb. 28 contract between Chevron and Hermiston specifies a
maximum volume of 20,000 MMBtu over a 15-year period commencing in the
summer of 1996. Transportation to the international border will be
carried out by NOVA Corp. of Alberta and Alberta Natural Gas Co. Ltd.
Carriage downstream of the border will be by a combination of Pacific
Gas Transmission Co. and Cascade Natural Gas Corp. The latter must
construct a delivery tap to serve the power plant.
     The gas price is a netback formula set to start at (U.S.)
$1.61/MMBtu at the wellhead, with annual 5.5% escalators every Nov. 1.
     The April 7 contract between Canstates and Hermiston calls for
15,000 MMBtu/day over the same term as that of the Chevron contract.
Canstates will buy the gas from Home Oil at a point on ANG's system.
Pricing is similar to the terms of the Chevron agreement.
     A Canstates official reports that Canstates's biggest existing
export business is a long-term relationship with Transco Gas Marketing
Co. under which TGMC receives about 120,000 Mcf/day at the Niagara
Falls border interchange. Canstates, which is controlled by ANG,
inherited most of the TGMC supply deal from Sulpetro Ltd., the
official adds.

Other proposed exports

     Renaissance is proposing to deliver 6,423 MMBtu/day to Bay State
under a 10-year contract commencing Jan. 1, 1995. The delivery point
would be Niagara Falls or upstream on the system of TransCanada
PipeLines Ltd., depending on which entity's firm capacity is used.
     NU would get 990 MMBtu/day over a 10-year term commencing Nov. 1,
1995.
     In both contracts, the gas price would consist of monthly demand,
reservation and transportation charges on TransCanada and NOVA plus a
commodity charge for gas based on an index of price reports in three
industry newsletters.
     According to its NEB filing, Western Gas wants to sell a maximum
of 7,241
Mcf/day to MGU at two locations under a 10-year contract retroactive
to Nov. 1, 1993. The contract price would consist of a demand charge,
inventory charge and commodity charge based on a published index.

NO CHANGES DETECTED IN INDUSTRY'S USE OF DERIVATIVES

     There has been no significant slowdown in the use of derivative
financial products by gas marketers, judging by the comments of
officials contacted by GAS TRANSACTIONS REPORT.
     Of four major marketers contacted, two, Tenneco Gas Trading Co.
and Coastal Gas Marketing Co., say they have taken no recent actions
to limit or restrict derivatives usage. Officials with the other two
companies, who declined to speak for attribution by name or company,
also say they haven't put any new trading policies in effect.
     The reason for official reticence is what one source described as
"political concerns" stemming from Congressional and administrative
scrutiny of derivatives usage. In a related event, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board on April 14 issued a proposed rule
requiring more complete disclosure of a company's use of derivatives.

Gas business `a major beneficiary'

     Brian McLaughlin, director of Tenneco Gas Trading, is adamant
about the benefits of derivatives in the gas business and bullish on
the growth outlook for derivatives such as swaps, options, futures and
more exotic hedging instruments. "In a word, no," was his response
when asked whether the company has reined in its hedging practices or
derivatives employment.

     ***********************************************************
     WHAT'S A `DERIVATIVE' DERIVED FROM?

          Derivatives "are complex financial securities whose
     values are derived from other underlying securities," says
     Richard George, a Charlottesville, Va., portfolio manager
     and editor of a newsletter on derivative risk. He divides
     derivatives into three broad types: exchange-listed, over-
     the-counter and structured/hybrid. Exchange-listed deriva-
     tives include futures and options tied to futures, stock and
     currency exchanges. Examples of OTC derivatives are swaps,
     options and forwards. Structured/hybrid derivatives include
     mortgage securities, bonds with warrants, "convertibles" and
     many more newly emerging instruments.
          To date, gas marketers have relied primarily on
     exchange-listed and OTC derivatives. Industry insiders say
     the use of more-exotic hybrids and custom-structured
     derivatives has been limited so far to a small group of the
     industry's most sophisticated traders.
     ***********************************************************

     McLaughlin would not comment about the losses from derivative
trading reported by companies outside of the gas industry. But he
thinks that derivatives -- based on standard agreements "with slight
modifications and negotiations among counterparties" -- are just what
the gas market needs to keep growing and avoid the distortions of the
past.
     "The gas business has been a major beneficiary of the use of
futures and other derivatives," he says. "We see the operations of the
financial side of the industry as a benchmark for the physical side,"
especially by pointing the way toward greater precision in terminology
and standardization of procedures.
     He concedes that derivatives bring greater risk -- and the risk is
growing as traders attempt to make ever-longer derivative-based
transactions. The key to avoiding fiascos of the type that recently
befell MG Corp., Procter & Gamble Co., Marion Merrill Dow Inc. and
others is to cover all foreseeable risks with appropriate hedges, he
says, and if none are available, "don't be in there half-covered."

CGM likes ERMA

     Venita Ferguson, Coastal Gas Marketing's risk manager, reports
that her company is continuing its practice of hedging price
uncertainties with  offsetting derivative products. CGM makes frequent
use of a modified version of the Energy Risk Management Association's
master energy price swap agreement, she says.
     CGM has put no new restrictions on derivatives usage in recent
weeks, Ferguson says. That part of the company's business is growing
with its portfolio of long-term sales, she adds. (FASB, 203-847-0700;

MMS SENDS FEDERAL ROYALTY PAYERS SCALED-DOWN INFORMATION REQUEST

     The Minerals Management Service this month sent a scaled-down
order for gas-contract settlement information to holders of federal
oil and gas leases. The action carries out MMS's side of an agreement
made earlier this year with the Independent Petroleum Association of
America and other industry groups.
     The industry groups had challenged MMS's interpretation of the
application of royalty regulations to contract-settlement payments.
Last June, MMS ordered all federal lessees to submit detailed
information about payments they had received in settlement of gas-
contract disputes. The order came as a wave of take-or-pay settlements
resulting from industry restructuring was winding down.
     IPAA, in conjunction with the American Petroleum Institute, sued
MMS over the June order and sought a preliminary injunction in federal
court against the data collection effort. It agreed to drop the
request for injunction upon issuance by MMS of the revised order.
     The main difference between last year's order and this year's is
that MMS no longer requires lessees to list the federal or Indian
leases involved in each settlement or the proportion of the settlement
attributable to those leases. MMS continues to require that the
federal royalty payers list all settlements taking place after Dec.
31, 1979.

Still may go to court

     As did the old order, the new order requires royalty payers to
give the date of settlement, the producer's name, the purchaser's
name, the amount of the settlement and the date the settlement payment
was received. MMS defines a settlement as "including, but not limited
to... take-or-pay, price deficiencies, buy out or buy down payments,
etc."
     Under terms of the agreement, the associations will not challenge
the latest MMS order. In the near future, MMS will select up to 10
responses for which it will issue an "order to pay." Those cases will
then enter the Interior Dept.'s administrative review process, and MMS
says it expects they will be litigated to determine whether the
government is owed royalties based on the settlement payments. (MMS,
202-208-3983)

STANDARD CONTRACT HAS ALTERNATIVES FOR SITUATIONS OF NON-PERFORMANCE

     As it does with force majeure, a standard gas contract drafted by
a committee of marketing and legal executives provides alternative
clauses for situations in which one party fails to live up to the deal.
     The standard EFP contract offers two alternatives for the article
titled "Failure to Perform," Article 10. The "A" set places the burden
of dispute resolution on both contract parties by calling on them to
"cooperate" to resolve non-performance issues. The "A" set also
provides for more severe penalties for non-performance.

Alternative A: cooperative dispute resolution


ARTICLE X

Failure to Perform

10A.1 Subject to the tolerances set forth in Transporter's tariff,
Seller is obligated daily to Schedule, or cause to be Scheduled, and
to deliver to the Transporter which is delivering Gas to the Delivery
Point, and Buyer is obligated daily to Schedule, or cause to be
Scheduled, and to receive, from the Transporter receiving the Gas at
the Delivery Point, the Daily Contract Quantity of Gas at the Delivery
Point agreed to for the Period of Delivery. Both parties hereto shall
also promptly notify each other as soon as possible of any
notification by a Transporter of any imbalances which are occurring or
which have occurred, and they shall cooperate to eliminate such
imbalances including the use of any make-up or balancing rights which
either party may have.
[The requirement to notify the other party of an imbalance situation
could be accomplished by telephone; that possibility, along with the
parties' mutual obligation to "cooperate" on the elimination of an
imbalance, adds up to a fairly broad imbalance remedy.]

10A.2 If either party fails to Schedule the Daily Contract Quantity,
as provided in Section 10.1, that party shall be liable for the
following damages:

(1) If the amount Buyer Scheduled on any day is less than the
applicable Daily Contract Quantity and the Sales Price, as defined in
Section 10.2(3) hereunder, is less than the Contract Price, then Buyer
shall be liable for and shall pay to Seller (a) a dollar amount equal
to any demand charges which Seller has incurred on the Transporter
immediately upstream of the Delivery Point for firm transportation of
Gas which Buyer failed to Schedule and (b) a dollar amount equal to
the sum of the product of (i) the difference between the Contract
Price and the Sales Price the Seller receives, multiplied by (ii) the
difference between the Daily Contract Quantity and the quantities
Scheduled by Buyer for each such day during the Period of Delivery.
Receipt of full payment hereunder by Seller shall act to reduce the
Contract Quantity by a quantity equal to the difference between the
original Contract Quantity and the total quantity Scheduled for the
Period of Delivery.
[For example, if the buyer takes 2,000 MMBtu less than the DCQ and the
seller is forced to sell the gas for 10 cents/MMBtu below the contract
price, the buyer must pay the seller $200 per each day it under-takes
plus the pipeline demand charges paid by the seller for firm
transportation.]

(2) If the amount Seller Scheduled on any day is less than the
applicable Daily Contract Quantity and the Replacement Price, as
defined in Section 10.2(3) hereunder, is greater than the Contract
Price, then Seller shall be liable for and shall pay to Buyer (a) a
dollar amount equal to any demand charges which Buyer has incurred on
the Transporter immediately downstream of the Delivery Point for firm
transportation of Gas which Seller failed to Schedule and (b) a dollar
amount equal to the sum of the product of (i) the difference between
the Replacement Price and the Contract Price multiplied by (ii) the
difference between the Daily Contract Quantity and the quantities
Scheduled by Seller for each such day during the Period of Delivery.
Receipt of full payment hereunder by Buyer shall act to reduce the
original Contract Quantity by the difference between the original
Contract Quantity and the total quantity Scheduled by Seller for the
Period of Delivery.
[For example, if the seller delivers 2,000 MMBtu less than the DCQ and
the buyer is forced to buy replacement gas for 5 cents/MMBtu more than
the contract price, the seller must pay the buyer $100 for each day it
under-delivers plus the pipeline demand charges paid by the buyer for
firm service.]

(3) The "Sales Price" shall be the price at which Seller is able,
acting in good faith, to make comparable sales at the highest
reasonable price. The "Replacement Price" shall be the price at which
Buyer is able, acting in good faith, to obtain comparable supplies at
the lowest reasonable price. In the event Seller is not able to find a
market for the quantity of Gas within the Contract Quantity not taken
by the Buyer, the Sales Price shall be deemed to be the fair market
price for the Gas not taken, as agreed to by the parties, minus an
amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the Contract Price.
[To reach a valid sales price, the parties can resort to some index --
such as closing prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange or spot
prices published in newsletters.]
In the event Buyer is not able to find replacement gas for the
quantity of Gas within the Contract Quantity not delivered by Seller,
the Replacement Price shall be deemed to be the fair market price for
the Gas not delivered, as agreed to by the parties, plus an amount
equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the Contract Price.
[As was the case with the Sales Price determination, it is left to the
buyers to identify an index for the Replacement Price determination.]

10A.3 If by failing to receive or deliver quantities equal to the
Contract Quantity or by failing to confirm Scheduled quantities,
either party hereto creates an imbalance on a Transporter, such party
shall be solely liable for correcting such imbalance(s), so long as
the parties cooperate to correct the imbalance as provided in Section
10.1. If any such imbalance is not corrected, and charges or penalties
are assessed by a Transporter, the party which caused such imbalance
shall be responsible for any and all such charges or penalties.

Alternative B: independent action

     The second alternative for failure to perform makes each party
primarily responsible for finding a suitable commercial outlet in the
event of non-performance by the other party. In so doing, it
establishes the time limits of that substitute outlet and restricts
the damages that can be collected in the event of non-performance.

ARTICLE X

Failure to Perform
[The following section requires each party to find alternative supply
or buyers in the event of non-performance by the other party, and it
permits the alternative arrangement to continue until the end of the
month it which it was entered into.]
10B.1 If for any reason other than an event of force majeure either
party fails, in whole or in part, to perform its respective obligation
to deliver or take Gas under this Agreement, the other party shall use
its best efforts, acting in a commercially reasonable manner, to
mitigate the effect of such failure, which includes attempting to
secure an alternate interruptible supply, or interruptible market, as
the case may be, which allows the defaulting party to resume its
obligation when the defaulting party becomes capable of doing so. If
in so doing, Buyer secures an alternate source of supply and Seller
subsequently regains its ability to deliver Scheduled volumes, Buyer
shall not be required to accept Gas, and Buyer may, without prejudice
to its rights to collect damages from the Seller in accordance with
Section 10B.2 hereof, through the last day of the month in which
Seller's failure to deliver Gas occurs, rely upon the alternate supply
arrangements. If in acting to mitigate its damages Seller secures
alternate markets therefor and Buyer subsequently regains its ability
to accept delivery of Scheduled volumes, Seller shall not be required
to deliver the volumes that the Buyer was previously unable to accept
for delivery, and, Seller may, without prejudice to its rights to
collect damages from the Buyer in accordance with Section 10B.3
hereof, through the last day of the month in which Buyer's failure to
take Gas occurs, continue to deliver to the alternate markets the
nominated volumes of gas that it would have otherwise have been
obligated to deliver hereunder.

[The following section details and limits the damages to which a party
is entitled in the event of non-performance by the other party.]
10B.2 If Seller fails, in whole or in part, to Schedule volumes or to
make Scheduled volumes available to Buyer in accordance with this
Agreement and such failure is not excused by an event of force majeure
or some other provision of the Agreement, the Buyer's right to recover
damages for such failure shall be limited to the following:

(1) If Buyer obtains alternate supplies of Gas, a daily amount equal
to (a) the shortfall in delivery from the Scheduled amount ("Delivery
Shortfall") times the difference between (b) the Contract Price and,
(c) the price Buyer paid for the Gas obtained from an alternate
source. In no event, however, shall the amount of such damages exceed
the amount that would have been payable by the Buyer had the Seller
delivered the Scheduled volumes.

(2) If Buyer does not obtain alternate supplies of Gas, a daily amount
equal to the Seller's Delivery Shortfall times the Contract Price.
Seller agrees to pay Buyer any damages to which Buyer is entitled
hereunder on or before the 15th day after the Seller receives a
written calculation of the amount of such damages from the Buyer.
10B.3 If Buyer fails to Schedule volumes or to take on any day all or
any part of the volumes Scheduled by Buyer hereunder and such failure
is not excused by an event of force majeure or some other provision of
this Agreement, the Seller's right to recover damages for such failure
shall be limited to the following:

(1) If the Seller is able to obtain alternate markets for the Gas the
Buyer fails to take, a daily amount equal to the difference between
(a) the Scheduled volumes for such day and (b) the volumes taken on
such day by the Buyer ("Take Shortfall") times the difference between
(i) the price received by the Seller from the alternate buyer(s) and
(ii) the Contract Price.

(2) If the Seller is not able to obtain alternate markets for the Gas
the Buyer fails to take, a daily amount equal to the Take Shortfall on
such days times the Contract Price. Buyer agrees to pay Seller any
damages to which Seller is entitled in accordance with the above
provisions on or before the 15th day after the Buyer receives a
written calculation of the amount of such damages from the Seller.

Active aftermarket and capacity glut predicted

      Unseasonably mild weather in the Northeast has created a lull
in the capacity market after a busy bid week, and sources are
predicting an active aftermarket for capacity in November if the
mild weather keeps up.
      Replacement shippers held about 10 billion cfd in released firm
capacity on Oct. 28, down about 1.5 billion cfd from Sept. 28.
Storage capacity releases were done on CNG Transmission and Texas
Eastern Transmission.
      The aftermarket for capacity should be active now that
pipelines aren't discounting transportation as deeply and if the
weather stays mild, said Ben Hadden with Appalachian Gas Sales.
      He said there have been more release deals done this bid week
than during prior bid weeks, partly because bottlenecks haven't
shown up yet on the long-haul pipelines out of the Gulf Coast. In
past years capacity restraints usually had caused some problems
by now, but pipelines aren't anticipating allocating supply in the
near future, he added.
      "The market is pretty dead right now," said an official with a
Northeastern distributor. But look out if the weather suddenly
turns cold, he said. "If the weather all of a sudden heads south,
markets in the Northeast will catch fire."
      The distributor official said his company held on to its
Tennessee capacity in case the weather turns and its Texas Eastern
capacity so far wasn't selling very well.
      He said there is no demand on CNG, but demand on Columbia Gas
picked up a bit with its recallable capacity going for about a 5
cents/mcf daily demand rate. On Columbia Gulf, the official said he
got a 9 cents/mcf rate for capacity to Leach, Ky.
      The Lebanon, Ohio, interconnect was "really hot" during bid
week for gas sales and capacity releases, according to Hadden.
      On Texas Gas Transmission, Dayton Power & Light released
capacity in about 13 November release deals into Lebanon for daily
demand rates ranging from 5 cents/mcf to CMS Gas Marketing to
17.5 cents/mcf to Tenneco Gas Marketing.
      Term deals for the winter and beyond and storage releases are
starting to pop up on electronic bulletin boards. On CNG, the
Harriman Utility Board released 26 million cf of various storage
capacity on the pipeline to CNG Gas Services for an injection rate of
2.6 cents/mcf and a withdrawal rate of 2.8 cents/mcf. Boston Gas
picked up storage capacity on Texas Eastern from Dartmouth Power
and Bristol & Warren.
      Texas-Ohio Gas picked up about 16 million cf from Yankee Gas
in three term deals on Texas Eastern for about a 13 cents/mcf daily
demand rate in the field and a 21 cents/mcf rate into zone three.
All three deals run through March 1995.
      One source said if shippers start pulling the high-priced gas
they bought last April out of Northeastern storage there will
probably be plenty of capacity coming out of the Gulf Coast access
areas in November.
      Another source said he also expects an active aftermarket as
long as the weather stays mild. He said he's been getting a lot of
calls from customers willing to pay maximum rate into the
Northeast.
      Recallable deals on Tennessee into zone five were going for a
daily demand rate in the low-30 cents/mcf range, according to the
source.

Northern Border plans expansion into Indiana

      Northern Border Pipeline is seeking customers for a proposed
capacity expansion of its existing system and a pipeline extension
into Northern Indiana.
      The proposed capacity expansion involves increasing receipt
capacity by at least 60 million cfd between the Monchy receipt
point at the U.S./Canadian border and the Glen Ullin, N.D., receipt
point on the 42-inch system.
      The 30-inch system between Ventura and Harper, Iowa, is
marked for a 260 million cfd capacity expansion. Both expansions
will be accomplished through the addition of compression.
      The proposed extension into Northern Indiana involves three
legs that start with 163 miles of 30-inch pipeline from Harper,
Iowa, to Northern Illinois Gas' (NIGas) Troy Grove storage field in
Illinois.
      Along this segment, Northern Border proposes to connect with
Interstate Power at Prophetstown, Ill. The pipeline plans 2,200 hp
of compression for this leg with a maximum capacity of 260 million
cfd.
      From Troy Grove, Northern Border plans to build 69 miles of
26-inch pipeline without compression to Manhattan, Ill., where it
will connect with Peoples Gas Light & Coke in the area of Joliet, Ill.
Maximum capacity on this leg will also be 260 million cfd.
      The proposed extension then continues eastward 35 miles with
20-inch pipe into Northern Indiana to connect with Northern
Indiana Public Service (NIPSCO) at Griffith, Ind. Maximum capacity
on this segment will be 175 million cfd.
      Northern Border has not sought FERC approval for the project
yet. The pipeline has targeted Nov. 1, 1997, as the in-service date
for the expansion. The window for bidding on this potential
capacity opened Oct. 24 and will close Nov. 18, 1994. Northern
Border will do a final allocation of bids for the capacity and post
them on its electronic bulletin board by Dec. 16, 1994.
      For more information about the expansion, contact Bill Fonda
with Northern Border at 402-398-7756.

Pipelines go easy on scheduled November maintenance

      Few disruptions in capacity are expected during November as
scheduled maintenance continues to remain light on pipelines
across the United States.
      Starting Nov. 2, ANR Pipeline will be lowering a line at a stream
crossing upstream of the Eakley compressor station. The
maintenance work is scheduled to last about three days. Receipt
points in line segments SW2H, SW2I and SW2J will be shut in
during the work.
      On Oct. 31, Tennessee Gas Pipeline was at capacity through
station 219 in Mercer, Pa., and near capacity on the Sullivan City
lateral in Hidalgo, Texas. The pipeline said it may restrict services
starting Nov. 2.
      Texas Eastern Transmission was at capacity for interruptible
transportation on the 24-inch system through station 16 at Berne,
Ohio, and into the suction of Berne, Ohio, from the 24-inch system
on Nov. 1. The Wilcox, Willow Springs and Monroe laterals were also
at capacity.
      On Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line, flow through station 40 at
Sour Lake, Texas, was being allocated on Nov. 1. Also on Transco,
interruptible capacity was limited to 100 million cfd from station
180 in Virginia eastward.

Market

      A marketer in New England said Monday about gas prices, "I
think they'll come off a little bit." And a buyer in Houston
expected much the same, pointing to this week's December futures
close at almost a nickel off last week.
      In other trading, an eastern LDC was fishing for baseload gas
into Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line at station 65 at $1.74 but
couldn't find any baseload sellers under $1.78. Swing sellers were
offering deals at $1.72.
      At Parkway, Ontario, into the Union Gas system, buyers wanted
prices in the mid-$1.90s yesterday, while sellers wanted $2.05-15
for their gas.
      A West Coast marketer bought some Permian gas on El Paso at
$1.62, a healthy jump from the mid- to high-$1.50s at the end of
last week. He thought the price increase, which some sources said
had reached $1.68 by late yesterday afternoon, might be in
anticipation of some colder weather moving down from the
Northwest. He was hoping to sell it in the mid-$1.60s.
      Prices at AECO-C ranged from C$1.70-$1.80/gj for day-to-day
trading, and at Sumas into Northwest and at Kingsgate into PGT
prices hovered around $1.50.

Futures

      December futures will find technical support at around $1.93,
with short covering expecting at that level, said an analyst.
However, the contract is expected to find its ceiling at $1.87 and
then trade lower.

Storage

      With withdrawal season right around the corner, net injections
into storage jumped to 8.6 billion cfd, more than double the
previous week's, according to the American Gas Assn.'s (AGA)
survey for the week ending Oct. 21.
      This turnaround at the end of the injection season pushed
working gas in storage to 3,081 billion cf, after passing 3 trillion cf
the previous week, according to AGA's survey. Storage facilities
nationwide are now 96% full, using AGA's estimated full level of
3,206 billion cf.
      Sources said the big increase in injections was probably due to
storage users trying to top off their storage capacity in the last few
weeks of injection season.
      Net injections were 60 billion cf, up 36 billion cf, or 5.1 billion
cfd, from last week's estimate.
      Storage facilities in the east hit 97% full, compared to 95% the
preceding week. The producing region appears to have completed its
injections, with net injections of only 1 billion cf.

WISCONSIN PSC MODIFIES EXISTING ELECTRIC SERVICE
EXTENSION RULES BY EXTENDING THE REFUND PERIOD

The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (commission) has
decided to modify its current set of electric service
extension rules to lessen the financial impact upon customers
who wish to extend service to previously undeveloped areas.
The Commission indicated that a wholesale change in the
current rules was not appropriate because it would likely
contribute to urban sprawl, but it was reasonable to extend
the refund period for those customers.

Extension rules determine who pays for the cost incurred in
extending electric utility service to a previously unserved
area. When a customer applies for an extension with a utility
where existing distribution lines are far from the dwelling,
the utility has to extend a distribution line all the way in
to the new location. The customer is responsible for the cost
of the distribution line in advance.

Under the current extension rules the customer is entitled to
a small credit based on the depreciated cost of the
distribution system. The customer is also eligible for
refunds when other customers attach to the same distribution
line that he or she paid for.

CHEVRON GETS GO-AHEAD TO EXPLORE
1.77-MILLION-ACRE TRACT IN PERU

Chevron Overseas Petroleum (Peru) Limited has signed a license
contract with PeruPetro S.A. to explore more than 1.77 million
acres on Block 52 in the Peruvian highlands.

Chevron's exploration program will include a seismic program
and other geologic studies, and is anticipated to start
immediately. Following acquisition and interpretation of the
geologic and seismic data, determinations regarding drilling
will be made.

Block 52 is located 250 miles east of the capital city of
Lima and is adjacent to the giant Camisea gas/condensate
discoveries. It comprises 718,928 hectares (more than 1.77
million acres), and has had no previous exploration activity.

"We are delighted to be returning to Peru," said Richard
Matzke, president of Chevron Overseas Petroleum, "and we are
eager to begin exploration in such an exciting area. We feel
Block 52 offers excellent potential due to its geologic
similarities with and geographic proximity to the prolific
Camisea fields," he added.

Chevron's history in Peru dates back to the 1930s when the
company conducted geological exploration in the foothills of
the Andes. In addition, Chevron operated a refinery in
Conchan, Peru, until 1972.

The Peruvian government's newly revised hydrocarbon laws and
noted that they have enhanced the appeal of operating in Peru
by offering favorable terms and encouraging foreign investment
in the country.

MITCHELL'S REMAINING INTEREST IN THE WOODLANDS
COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK FOR $17 MILLION

Mitchell Energy & Development Corp., The Woodlands, TX, has
sold its remaining 50 percent interest in The Woodlands
Communications Network to TCI Communications, Inc., for $17
million, making TCI Communications the sole owner.

This business was started by Mitchell to serve The Woodlands
when it opened in October 1974 and provides cable television,
home security and advertising services. In April 1987,
Mitchell sold a. half interest to United Artists Cable.  Tele-
Communications, Inc. (TCI) acquired United Artists' cable
systems in 1991, including its half interest in The Woodlands
Communications Network.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer George P. Mitchell said
the sale of the remaining interest in The Woodlands
Communications Network is part of the company's continuing
efforts to enhance profitability by selling non-core assets,
including those that have a greater value to others. The
company has sold more than $200 million in assets during the


last 18 months, Mitchell added.

Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. is among the nation's
largest independent producers of natural gas and natural gas
liquids. The company, through its subsidiary, The Woodlands
Corporation, also is the developer of a 25,000-acre
master-planned community 27 miles north of Houston. Mitchell's
shares are traded on the New York and Pacific stock exchanges
under the symbols MND A (voting) and MND B (non-voting).

TO $282 ON OPERATING EARNINGS OF $504 MILLION UP 24 PERCENT

Chevron Corporation has reported that special charges reduced
third quarter net income 34 percent to $282 million, or $.44
per share, from $425 million ($.65 per share) reported for the
third quarter of 1994.

Excluding special charges, 1995 third quarter results were
$504 million, a 24 percent increase from adjusted earnings of
$407 million for the prior year quarter. Special charges
totaled $222 million and included a $168 million provision
related to the company's recently announced decision to
dispose of its real estate development operations.

Commenting on third quarter results, Chairman and CEO Ken
Derr said, "We're pleased to report another quarter with
operating profit that exceeded half a billion dollars.
Despite flat crude oil and lower natural gas prices compared
with the third quarter of last year, our operating earnings
increased' nearly $100 million, reflecting ongoing strength
in our chemicals and international upstream businesses and our
continued emphasis on reducing costs."

Derr continued, "Our increased profitability this year
translates to a return on capital employed, adjusted for
special items, of 10.2 percent for the 12 months ended Sept.
30. This compares with a return of 8.6 percent for the
calendar year 1994, and demonstrates good progress toward our
12.0 percent goal."

Adjusted for special items, earnings for the first nine
months of 1995 were $1.511 billion, up 38 percent from $1.093
billion for the 1994 nine months. Net income for the 1995
nine months was $1.348 billion, or $2.07 per share, including
special charges totaling $163 million; net income for the
comparable prior year period was $1.070 billion, or $1.64 per
share, and included $23 million of special charges.

"We have a major turnaround currently under way at our
Richmond, Calif., refinery," said Derr. The refinery is
expected to be down for about six weeks to prepare for the
introduction of California-mandated reformulated gasolines
early next year. When the turnaround is complete, we will be
positioned to be the largest producer of these new gasolines.
However, the shutdown will have an effect on our fourth
quarter operations."

Total revenues in the third quarter were $9.3 billion, down 2
percent from $9.5 billion in the year earlier quarter. Total
revenues for the first nine months of 1995 were $27.9
billion, a 5 percent increase from $26.6 billion reported for
the 1994 nine-month period.

Included in third quarter net income were foreign exchange
losses of $26 million in 1995 and $30 million in 1994. For the
first nine months, foreign exchange losses were $20 million
in 1995 and $51 million in 1994.

U.S. exploration and production third quarter net earnings
were $131 million compared with $63 million in the 1994 third
quarter. However, current quarter earnings included a net
benefit of $19 million from special items, whereas 1994
earnings were reduced $61 million for environmental
remediation and litigation provisions. In the 1995 quarter, a
$27 million gain resulting from a refund of federal offshore
lease costs was partially offset by environmental remediation
provisions.

Excluding special items in both quarters, 1995 earnings of
$112 million declined from year-ago earnings of $124 million,
primarily because of lower production volumes and lower
natural gas prices. The company's average U.S. liquids
realization of $14.91 per barrel was little changed from the
$15.03 realized in last year's third quarter; however,
average natural gas realizations of $1.40 per thousand cubic
feet in the 1995 third quarter were down 14 percent from
$1.62 last year. Net liquids production declined to 346,000
barrels per day from 371,000, and net natural gas production
volumes of 1.8 billion cubic feet per day were down 10 percent
from 2.0 billion in last year's third quarter. The lower
production levels were due to normal field declines and a
natural gas field unitization adjustment.

Depreciation expense declined in line with lower production;
exploration expense also declined due to lower well
write-offs.

International exploration and production third quarter net
earnings were $140 million compared with $131 million in the
1994 third quarter. The 1995 quarter included special charges
of $22 million for prior year tax adjustments, mostly due to
a statutory tax rate increase in Australia.

Earnings benefited from higher crude oil sales volumes, due
to the timing of vessel loadings, and a lower effective income
tax rate due to the earnings mix. Crude oil and natural gas
realizations were about flat with the prior year quarter.
Exploration expenses increased due to higher well write-offs.
International net liquids production volumes increased
slightly to 644,000 barrels per day from 640,000 in the 1994
third quarter. Net natural gas production volumes declined
about 6 percent, primarily in Canada, to 539 million cubic
feet per day.

U.S. refining and marketing net earnings were $98 million
compared with a loss of $110 million in the year-ago quarter;
however, when special charges in both periods for
environmental remediation are excluded, earnings were
basically flat at $109 million for the current year quarter
and $108 million for the 1994 quarter.

Refined product sales margins improved in the 1995 quarter on
slightly higher prices. Sales volumes declined 13 percent to
1.2 million barrels per day, as a result of the sales of the
company's Philadelphia refinery in August 1994 and Port
Arthur, Texas, refinery in February 1995. The volume decline
occurred in lower margin unbranded bulk sales; branded
gasoline sales through the company's marketing system
increased 2 percent.

International refining and marketing net earnings declined
slightly to $53 million from $55 million because of special
charges of $15 million in the 1995 third quarter related to
restructurings in certain Caltex areas and in the company's
United Kingdom operations.

Excluding the special charges, earnings increased $13 million
as improved operations in Canada and the United Kingdom more
than offset a decline in Caltex earnings, where sales margins
remain depressed in some of that affiliate's operating areas.
International sales volumes decreased 4 percent to 894,000
barrels per day, largely due to declines in U.K. marketing
sales and in the company's international trading operations.
Caltex sales volumes decreased 1 percent.

Chemicals net earnings increased to $127 million in the 1995
third quarter from $68 million in the comparable 1994 quarter.
Adjusting for special charges in both periods, mostly
environmentally related, earnings of $148 million in the 1995
third quarter were more than double the $72 million earned in
the third quarter of 1994.

The higher 1995 earnings reflect higher product prices and
sales volumes compared with the prior year quarter, consistent
with the improved state of the petrochemicals industry.
However, prices for the company's major products began to
soften in the third quarter, and results declined from the
record $175 million earned in the second quarter. Although
still much stronger than a year ago, prices have weakened for
major products such as styrene and polyethylene.

Corporate and other net charges were $277 million in the
current year quarter compared with income of $212 million in
the 1994 third quarter. Both quarter's results were distorted
by special items. The 1995 quarter included special charges
totaling $172 million, almost all related to the write-down of
the company's investment in the real estate development
business. Results in the 1994 quarter included the reversal of
$301 million of previously established tax and related
interest reserves resulting from a global settlement with the
Internal Revenue Service covering several open tax years.

Excluding the special items in both periods, corporate and
other charges were $105 million in the 1995 third quarter and
$89 million in the year-ago quarter. The 1995 increase was due
to consolidating income tax adjustments.

Capital and exploratory expenditures, including the company's
share of affiliate expenditures, were $1.144 billion in the
third quarter, compared with $1.042 billion spent in last
year's third quarter. Total expenditures for the first nine
months of 1995 were $3.292 billion, up 4 percent from $3.174
billion spent in the same period in 1994.

MITCHELL REPORTS LOWER THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS

Mitchell Energy & Development Corp., The Woodlands, TX,
has reported that its net earnings for the three months ended
Oct. 31, 1995, declined to $11.3 million, or 21 cents a share,
from $15 million, or 28 cents a share, in the same period a
year earlier.

Excluding unusual gains and charges in both years, earnings
were $15 million, versus $10.6 million in the prior-year
period. Current-quarter results were adversely affected by
several factors: significantly lower natural gas prices in
North Texas due to the termination of the premium-priced gas
sales contract covering this production in July 1995; weak
spot market prices; a 23-day curtailment in October of gas
and natural gas liquids production in North Texas resulting
from maintenance on the interstate pipeline that transports
Mitchell's gas from this area to Midwest markets; and a
47-day shutdown of the company's one-third-owned MTBE gasoline
additive plant to increase capacity. These factors were more
than offset by profits totaling $19.4 million ($12.6 million
after tax)

Real estate operating earnings increased to $28.9 million,
from $6.3 million during the prior year's third quarter. Much
of the improvement results from the previously discussed $19.4
million cable TV gain. Current-period earnings also
benefitted from an increase in residential lot sales in The
Woodlands at prices 8 percent higher per square foot than
those realized in the prior-year period, improved occupancy
at The Woodlands Executive Conference Center and Resort, and
earnings from The Woodlands Mall, which opened in October
1994.

During the first nine months of the current fiscal year, the
company had net earnings of $13.6 million, or 26 cents per
share, compared with $36.8 million, or 70 cents per share, in
the same period last year. Excluding unusual items in both
years, earnings during the current period were $41.1 million,
versus $28.1 million during the prior-year period.
Year-to-date results benefitted from higher natural gas
liquids margins, profits from the MTBE plant, the gain from
the cable system sale, increased earnings from residential and
commercial activities in The Woodlands and lower staff and
interest expenses. These factors were partially offset by
lower gas prices resulting from the buyout of the North Texas
gas sales contract and weak spot market prices.

Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. is a large independent
energy producer and through its subsidiary, The Woodlands
Corporation, is the developer of a 25,000-acre master-planned
community located 27 miles north of downtown Houston. Its
shares are listed on the Now York and Pacific stock exchanges
under the symbols MND A (voting) and MND B (non-voting).

MURPHY OIL REORTS ON THIRD QUARTER

Murphy Oil's president and CEO, Claiborne P.  Deming,
announced today that net income for the third quarter of 1995
totaled $7.6 million, $.17 a share, compared to $37.3 million,
$.83 a share, earned in the third quarter a year ago.  The
current quarter included a bensfit of $8.1 million, $.18 a
share, resulting from settlement of tax matters in the U.S.
and U.K., while the third quarter of 1994 included a benefit
of $13.9 million, $.31 a share, from settlement of a U.S.
Department of Energ Proposed Remedial Order. Net cash from
operating activities excluding changes in noncash working
capital items totaled $84.2 million in the third quarter of
1995, down six percent from a year ago.

In commenting on the results for the current quarter, Mr.
Deming said, "Excluding the unusual item, operating results
reflected a loss of $.5 million that included a $13.6 million
after-tax charge for a previously announced unsuccessful well
in Mobile Block 908. In total, exploration and production
operations lost $5 million in the third quarter of 1995
compared to earning $9.8 million a year ago.

In addition to the Mobile Block 908 well, the current quarter
was adversely affected by generally lower crude oil sales
prices, lower U.S. and Canadian natural gas sales prices, and
an increase in international exploration activity. Partial
offsets were provided by a 12-percent increase in crude oil
and gas liquids production and a 10-percent increase in
natural gas production. Posted price for West Texas
Intermediate crude oil fluctuated between $15.00 a barrel and
$17.25 a barrel in the third quarter of 1995, and closed the
quarter at $15.75.

"Barnings from our worldwide downstream segment totaled $4.2
million in the current quarter compared to $11.9 million a
year ago. U.S. operations accounted for most of the decline as
a result of lower unit margins and a decline in salso of
refined products.

"Earnings from farm, timber, and real estate totaled $1.3
million, a decreases of 58 percent compared to the third
quarter of 1994. Timber operations accounted for most of the
decline."

Exploration and production operations in the U.S., which
included the $13.6 million after-tax charge for the Mobile
Block 908 well, lost $8.9 million compared to earning $.7
million in the third quarter of 1994. Operations in Canada
earned $6.3 million in the current quarter, up from $6.2
million a year ago, and U.K. operations earned $.9 million
compared to $1 million.

Injection program to up yield at Norway's Snorre field

     Norway's Petroleum Directorate says estimated total reserves from the
Snorre field in that country's sector of the North Sea could soon be
upgraded by 20% to 1 billion barrels.
     That's possible because of a pilot project involving the alternate
injection of water and natural gas to increase exploitation yields.
     The field, discovered in 1979, is in blocks 34/4 and 34/7 about 125
miles west of the coastal community of Floro. Norway's Saga Petroleum is
operator of the field -- with Esso Norway as co-operation partner -- for
Deminex, Idemitsu, Norsk Hydro, Elf Petroleum Norge, Amerada Hess,
Enterprise Oil and DNO.
     The Snorre project is one of the most challenging of its kind. It is in
deep water, and the reservoir is extensive and complex. Exploration
drilling delineated the field during most of the 1980s, but sustained low oil
prices added to slow development.
     Original estimates put Snorre recoverable reserves at 77 million barrels
of oil, 247 bcf of gas and 1.8 bcf of natural gas liquids, with a field life
expectancy of 20-25 years. At its peak, original estimates were that field's
liquid output would average 190,000 b/d.
     Located in 985' of water, the field is the first truly deepwater
development in the North Sea. It consists of the largest tension leg
platform (TLP) yet installed, with 40 well slots, and a large, 20-well slot,
remote subsea production system. Wells drilled from the TLP went on
production in August 1992, more than a month ahead of schedule and
under the original budget.
     The field, whose oil-bearing sandstone reservoir layers are found in two
formations (Statfjord and Lunde, averaging 7,500'-8,500' below the ocean
bottom), with pay ranging from nearly 2,790' to 330' in thickness, will be
developed in two stages. The operations in Phase 1 will account for all the
recoverable reserves in the Statfjord formation and some 30% of the
estimated recoverable reserves from the Lunde formation. The decision on
Phase 2 development will be based on experience with Phase 1 production
but likely will involve either relocation of the TLP to the northern part of
the field or installation of two new subsea production systems.
     Tests of wells drilled from the TLP to the Lunde formation have proven
Snorre to be richer than first believed. Based on this, the field's life
expectancy has been extended beyond 2015. Snorre production is about
120,000 b/d currently.
     Oil and gas production is partially processed on the Snorre TLP and
then exported in two 17-mile pipelines to the Statfjord A platform, where
the final processing takes place. The processed oil is then loaded into
tankers through the Statfjord buoy loading system, while the gas is
transported to shore through a Statpipe system.
     However, field output from Snorre likely will not be increased for some
time since the Statfjord platform can handle only 140,000 b/d from Snorre.
     Production from the Snorre reservoirs requires a concept calling for
nearly 100 wells, half of which will be used for water injection and natural
gas reinjection.
     The Snorre subsea production system is the world's largest.  The
system's wells are drilled from a floating drilling unit. The system has a
double set of well slots (10 x 10). The inner row of wells is intended to be
drilled first. They will come on stream one by one. The system's manifold
design allows each well slot to be used for either production or injection
purposes. The 10 outer wells become operational when the inner wells
have ceased production and have been plugged. The 10 x 10 arrangement
allows the manifold and control system, as well as all pipelines and subsea
trees, to be used twice, helping to cut costs beyond those for drilling and
completion.
     Large amounts of electricity are required on the TLP for drilling
operations, water injection and processing. The platform has its own
power station consisting of four gas-powered generators giving a total
capacity of 60 MW.
     Water, pumped into the reservoir to raise formation pressure and
thereby increase production, is pumped from the sea and filtered in the
TLP's water injection system before it reaches the reservoir.
     In addition to 20 wells drilled for oil production, 40 wells will be
drilled from the Snorre TLP, most of the remaining well slots being used
for injection wells.
     To ensure optimum exploitation of the reservoir, the wells will be
drilled horizontally away from both the TLP and the subsea production
system. On the average, wells will be drilled some 1.5 miles below the
seabed, and their horizontal distance from the platform may be as much as
2.5 miles. Total measured depth of wells could reach nearly four miles.

DOE funds seven reservoir projects

     DOE hopes a new initiative will result in more effective production
methods that could keep many aged U.S. oil fields in operation,
particularly for independent producers.
     Under the initiative, DOE has made more than $5 million available to
six leading petroleum-oriented universities and one state geological survey
to help develop more accurate methods for depicting the geological
makeup of oil and gas reservoirs.
     The seven projects were selected during DOE's 1993 petroleum
geoscience competition. Some 63 proposals were received in response to a
DOE solicitation issued last October.
     In total, the seven projects will cost more than $8 million, with the
additional $3 million to be funded by the winning teams. In most cases,
says DOE, the sponsors will team with major and independent producers,
service companies and oilfield consultants to carry out the work.
     All of the projects will apply advanced geoscience and reservoir
engineering concepts to provide operators with a better picture of a
reservoir's characteristics. In some cases, says DOE, the projects will result
in smaller independent producers having access to new and sophisticated
techniques that have been available to and used by major producers but
have not yet trickled down to the independent sector.
     The selected projects, whose quoted costs are estimates and may
change during negotiations, will take place during a three-year period, and
work will be monitored by DOE's Bartlesville, Okla., Project Office.
     The seven selected projects -- with contacts for companies interested in
participating -- are:

IPAA reports drilling cost uptick in 1992

     The Independent Petroleum Assn. of America says domestic oil and gas
wells are getting deeper, and operators are returning to existing wells with
improved recovery technology.
     Yet, in 1992, this trend failed to reflect in higher drilling costs. To the
contrary, the IPAA report observes that the average cost-per-well last year
exhibited a decline of nearly 4%.
     The report adds that much of this decline was precipitated by heavy
discounting by service and supply companies .
     Overall, however, the cost of drilling and completing domestic wells
last year increased by slightly more than 1% from 1991, because wells on
average are deeper than ever.
     Scott Espenshade, who prepared the report, says record low drilling in
1992 forced service and supply companies to offer discounts in order to
get more business. He added that the industry should expect to see such
deep discounts through the remainder of 1993.
     He said an estimate of an average dollar amount for drilling costs
would not prove valid, since the cost varies greatly from well to well.
Instead, the report uses 1989 data to provide a median for comparison for
the 1992 figures.
     Since 1989, the report observes, the cost-per-foot drilling average has
fallen by more than 6% and the cost per well has risen almost 2%. This
should be good news to independents, it adds, since the per-well rise is
modest while wells continue to be drilled deeper.
     Since 1989, U.S. well depth has increased an average of 12%,
Espenshade writes. One cause of this, he adds, is that producers are
looking at deeper pay zones. Also, they are going back to old wells with
improved recovery technology.
     Purchased items accounted for 69% of the cost of drilling and
equipping wells in 1992. And the remaining 31% involved payments to
drilling contractors. This portion of the drilling cost has fallen by about
20% from 1990 levels, IPAA notes. The decline was anticipated because
the industry's average rig count for 1992 -- 721 -- was an all-time low.
     Although overall drilling costs have increased slightly so far in 1993,
says Gene Ames, IPAA chairman, "there is no better time to drill for
natural gas and oil here at home with drilling costs down and the use of
advanced technology on the upswing."
     The drilling cost report will be published quarterly, says Espenshade.
He says he hopes the quarterly report will be beneficial to independents.
Instead of basing their findings on information gathered on a "typical"
U.S. well, he noted, future reports will be broken down by region to reflect
the differences between drilling areas.
     Producers also can take heart from a report just released by Houston-
based Baker Hughes Inc., which estimated the average rig count for 1993
will be about 760 working units.

Two Kern fields revise reserves downward

     Downward additions outnumber by a margin of 2-to-1 upward
additions to estimated reserves in four of California's Kern County oil
fields, where improved recovery projects play a role in production.
     The state Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources Div. in its annual look at
how much recoverable oil is left in the state's fields singles out the Cymric
and Yowlumne fields for upward revisions totaling 24 million barrels;
however, the gains are not enough to make up for downward revisions
totaling 55 million barrels in the McKittrick and Poso Creek fields.
     The Cymric field's Reef Ridge-Antelope pool in the Welport area of the
field is credited with addition of 15.2 million barrels, boosting estimated
reserves to 78.7 million barrels as of the first of this year. Cumulative
production is 191.4 million barrels. Production last year averaged 2,000
b/d. In January, production from 82 wells was 2,750 b/d. Steam plays an
important role here, with Chevron Corp. injecting about 7,000 b/d in cyclic
steaming of some 50 wells.
     The Yowlumne field's Stevens pay picked up 8.8 million barrels,
boosting estimated reserves to 19.1 million barrels. Cumulative production
is 95.9 million barrels. Fifty-six Stevens wells were on line in January,
producing 6,720 b/d. Waterflooding plays an important role at Yowlumne.
Arco Oil & Gas Co., the field operator, puts away 40,000 b/d in 29
injection wells.
     On the debit side, the main area of the McKittrick field was
downgraded 34.5 million barrels, reducing estimated reserves to 4.2
million barrels. In January, 350 wells produced 2,900 b/d. Steamflooding
has been reduced to a minor role in the field, which was on production as
early as 1896 with actual discovery date unknown. In January, only four
injectors were active, with steam injection at a rate of 511 b/d. One
hundred nineteen injection wells were shut in.
     The Poso Creek field, a 1920 discovery, took hits in the Premier area,
where reserves dropped 15.5 million barrels, reducing year-end estimated
reserves to 2 million barrels; and the McVan area, where the drop was 5
million barrels, leaving estimated reserves of 300,000 barrels. Cumulative
production from Premier is 72.5 million barrels. In January, 62 wells
produced 300 b/d. Steamflooding was down to 12 injectors and a rate of
540 b/d with 10 injection wells shut in. At McVan, cumulative production
is 7.2 million barrels. In January, 53 wells produced 146 b/d. Five
steamflood injection wells were shut in.

'92 Okla. oil yield down; gas up slightly

     Oil production in Oklahoma during 1992 declined 5.6% from 1991
totals, while natural gas production increased by 1.4%, says a recent report
from the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.
     Crude oil and condensate production totaled 101.8 million barrels,
down 6 million barrels from 1991's 107.8 million barrels. Daily average
production was 278,234 barrels, compared with 295,457 b/d in 1991.
     Natural and casinghead gas production last year totaled 1.962 tcf,
compared with 1.935 tcf a year earlier. Daily average production was
5.362 bcf compared with 5.302 bcf/d a year earlier.
     Monthly production figures indicate the decline continued into early
1993, the report notes. For February 1993, oil production totaled 7,006,551
barrels of crude oil and condensate for a daily average of 250,234 barrels.
This was an 8.9% decline from that reported for February 1992.
     Natural gas production also showed a dip for February, with a total of
100.4 bcf, for a daily average of nearly 3.6 bcf. This was a 7.7% decline
from February 1992 figures.
     Oklahoma oil production has declined annually from 1984 production
of 168.6 million barrels. Oil production in 1992 was the state's lowest
since 1919 when production totaled 86.9 million barrels.
     The average price paid for Oklahoma oil in 1992 was $18.99/barrel,
compared with an average price of $19.72 in 1991. The average price for
Oklahoma natural gas was $1.63/mcf, compared with $1.57/mcf a year
earlier.
     Of Oklahoma's 77 counties, 66 produced oil and 69 produced gas in
1992. Five counties produced neither during the year.
     Carter County, in Southcentral Oklahoma, led in oil production with
13.6 million barrels. Latimer County in Southeastern Oklahoma, led in
natural gas production with 212.8 bcf.

     Improving Matrix Acidizing with Nitrogen and Heat In Situ
Generation, by C.N. Khalil and Z. de Almeida of Petroleo Brasiliero SA.
From the 4th SPE, Et Al, Latin American Petroleum Engineering
Conference, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Oct. 14-19, 1990:
     In matrix acidizing operations in sandstone formations, special care
must be taken to prevent the formation of undesirable precipitates
generated by secondary reactions and by cooling of the surrounding
wellbore. The fast and thorough recovery of the spent acid fluid is
desirable. Based on studies conducted at the Petrobras R&D Center, a
chemical process that uses a mixture of saturated solutions of nitrogenated
salts to simultaneously generate nitrogen and heat was applied. The
intercalated cushions of acid fluid and a mixture of the above solutions
results in the in situ generation of nitrogen and heat. The increase in
formation temperature associated with the generation of gas increases the
radial penetration of the acid fluid, at the same time prevents the formation
of insoluble compounds and water blockage, and in general  eases the
recovery of the spent fluid (Abstract No. 545283).

New IOR patents

     S.F. Chien, C.L. Redus and P.L. Sigwardt of Texaco Development
Corp. have patented a method of determining flowline steam quality which
uses flow restriction devices with water addition at a known rate between
restrictions. Another object of the invention is to provide for certain field
applications where high-quality steam is mixed with water to achieve a
specific low-quality steam. In such case, the quality of the resulting low-
quality steam may be accurately determined (Canadian Patent No.
1,301,481).
     W.J. Clarke of Geochemical Corp. has patented a method of grouting
porous gas- and petroleum-bearing formations with a cementitious
material comprising ultra-fine ground slag that is useful for primary and
remedial cementing of a wellbore. A composition is provided which
comprises water, a dispersant, slag and an accelerator to activate the slag
(U.S. Patent No. 5,106,423).
     P.I. Day of Union Oil Co. of California has patented a method used for
determining true in situ resistivity of a thin layer within a formation from
dual induction log data. The method first corrects resistivity data read from
the dual induction log. A representative shoulder bed resistivity is first
determined from average deep resistivity data near the shoulder bed. A
paired estimate of layer resistivity and thickness is then computed based
on the determined shoulder bed resistivity, dip angle, and both deep and
medium resistivity data related to the thin bed. The method does not
require thickness data to be input, and in fact, outputs this information, if
needed (U.S. Patent No. 5,142,472).
     W. Sneed has patented a wireline delivery tool for an underground well
having a pipe, a surface seal for the pipe, and a wireline extending from
the surface into the pipe. The wireline delivery tool includes a body,
having a diameter of less than the interior diameter of the pipe, and a cup
extending from the body to create a seal with the interior of the pipe. A
longitudinal bore within at least a portion of the body has a port through
the body on each side of the cup, so that the ports are in communication
with the interior of the pipe. A pressure valve within the bore normally is
in the closed position. Pressure supplied into the pipe between the surface
seal and the cup will move the delivery tool within the pipe (U.S. Patent
No. 5,180,009).

Texas extends IOR incentives

     Texas Gov. Ann Richards signed into law a bill (S.B. 466) that extends
by four years the opportunity for operators to qualify for existing tax
incentives for new and expanded IOR projects.
     The bill extends the 50% severance tax break for IOR projects through
1998 on projects begun on or after Jan. 1, 1994. The credit will be
available after Jan. 1, 1996.
     Richards praised the measure's incentives. "The estimates I've seen for
the additional recovery of Texas oil surpass 650 million barrels for the
period extending to 1998," Richards said.
     The benefits of the legislation include additional investment in oil
production infrastructure and greater operating efficiency due to the longer
operational life of projects subject to the tax credit, she said.
     State Sen. Bill Sims, D-San Angelo, the bill's sponsor, said the bill was
"the single most important piece of legislation to help the oil and gas
industry passed in the 73rd Texas legislative session."

Horizontal well ups reserves

     Pogo Producing Co. is developing a 21-year-old oil and gas field in the
Gulf of Mexico, adding additional proven reserves with the aid of
horizontal drilling technology.
     Pogo, as operator, recently completed two wells in the Eugene Island
Block 330 field, one of which was the first horizontal well to be drilled in
the field's prolific reservoir.
     Pogo Chairman Paul Van Wagenen said first results from the horizontal
well, the C-7ST Well No. 2, indicated 535' of net pay section from two
lobes of the GA-2 horizon. The well was drilled from Platform C, one of
several fixed drilling/production platforms in the field.
     Due to the successful completion of the horizontal well, an additional
assignment of proven reserves in the field is anticipated, Van Wagenen
said.
     The horizontal well followed by about a week successful completion of
a conventional development well, the C-10ST No. 2, which is now
producing at a rate of 710 b/d of oil on a 20/64" choke, with flowing
tubing pressure of 620 psi. That well encountered 80' of net oil sand and is
producing from the HB sand horizons.
     Pogo, with 35% working interest, is the largest owner in the field,
which was discovered in 1972 and already has produced more than 600
bcf of gas and more than 100 million barrels of oil.
     Van Wagenen said Pogo's approved $60 million 1993 capital
expenditures budget includes a minimum of four development wells and
two recompletions in this very prolific block. The group expects to begin
drilling the third development well within a few weeks, following up with
further drilling and workover activity during the remainder of the year.

Imperial revs up heavy oil output

     Imperial Oil Ltd., Calgary, Alberta, is working to find ways to speed
heavy oil production at its Cold Lake project.
     A company senior vice president, Douglas Baldwin, said the company
will bring phases 7 and 8 of its Cold Lake program onstream later this
year, and the company is investigating ways to accelerate phases 9 and 10,
with steam injection scheduled to begin by mid-1994, adding 25,000 b/d to
production. That will bring total Cold Lake production to about 125,000
b/d, he added.
     Once completed, the four-phase expansion will have cost about C$100
million, Baldwin said.
     He said boilers and central processing facilities needed for the
expansion are in place, with the drilling of injection wells and producing
wells remaining to be completed.
     Drilling in Western Canada is at an all-time high, with shortages of
drilling equipment developing in some areas.

Horizontal scores in Sask.

     Incentives offered by Western Canadian provincial governments to
operators that drill horizontal wells or re-complete horizontally in vertical
wells are keeping the number of such wells high in recent months.
     An example is Petrolantic Ltd., which announced last week it had
completed a horizontal producer in the Battle Creek field in Western
Saskatchewan.
     The well, No. 2-27-3-26 W3M, was drilled to 6,750' total depth  and
cut 1,886' of the Shaunovan formation pay with the horizontal section.
Petrolantic described the main pay zone, some 915' in length, as excellent
oil-saturated, porous (18%-24% porosity) and permeable rock.
     Completed open hole, the well tested at rates of 150-260 b/d. It was
equipped with pumps and rods and is producing into on-site production
tanks.
     The well will be flow-lined to the battery to test production rates at full
capacity, the company said, adding it expects this rate to reach about 500
b/d. It is anticipated that the oil cut will stabilize at the 60% range.
Maximum projected flow rates achievable with existing facilities and
equipment is 800 b/d of fluid, the company added.
     If four-month production results meet projections, up to two additional
horizontal wells may be drilled in the Battle Creek area prior to year-end,
the company said.
     Petrolantic, with headquarters in Calgary, Alberta, says it holds a
32.4% before-payout interest and a 29.3% after-payout interest in the
Battle Creek project. Laval, Quebec-based Granisko Resources Inc. holds
a 29% working interest.

TAIWAN SELECTS ENSERCH, INTERGEN, SCEPTRE IN SECOND ROUND OF IPP BIDS

Enserch Development Corp., International Generating Co. (Intergen) and
Sceptre Power are members of four consortia proposing a total of 3,750 MW
that were selected by the government of Taiwan in the country's second
independent power solicitation, originally for 1,800 MW.
   The four consortia were among 18 bidders proposing 19 separate projects
representing 10,050 MW of new capacity for the solicitation.
   Recently, Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) selected from the
first round of proposals seven consortia to build a total of 7,110 MW (IPR,
28 July '95, 1). In that bidding, developers proposed 23 projects
representing more than 30,300 MW.
   Many of the projects selected in the first round have stalled due to the
lack of development experience among the local sponsors (IPR, 20 Oct '95,
1).
   In the latest round, Enserch Development of Dallas said it is part of a
consortium that will build, own and operate a 500-MW, oil-fired, project in
the northern city of Hualien.
   Enserch officials said the company will hold a 30% equity stake in the
project, while 70% will be held by two domestic partners, the Fubon Group
and the Ambassador Group.
   The consortium will spend the rest of 1996 on preliminary development
and expects to begin construction sometime in 1997. Commercial operation
will begin after 1999.
   Boston-based Intergen, a joint venture of Bechtel Group and Pacific Gas
& Electric affiliates, was selected to develop a private power project of
between 1,200 MW and 1,500 MW in a location known as Lizhe. Intergen
declined to release details of the project, but it will be in a joint
venture with a local Taiwanese company.
   Sceptre Power officials declined to release project details, but said
the company is actively developing a project in Taiwan. Reportedly, Sceptre
will have a partner, perhaps Taiwan Sakura Co., in a 1,224-MW, oil-fired
project in Suao.
   A fourth award, to a joint venture of Taiwan's Cheng-Chou Electronics
and ESC of Germany, was for a 600-MW to 700-MW project in Hsin-Chu, though
this could not be confirmed at presstime.
   All four projects are expected to be in commercial operation by 2000 or
2001.
   The government said power rates offered by developers were very
competitive, but did not offer details. The developers now must focus on
obtaining environmental approvals.

S&P DOWNGRADES SOME PROJECT DEBT DUE TO NIMO PRESSURE ON NUG PACTS

   Standard & Poor's has downgraded two non-utility generation debt issues
because of their reliance on payments by Niagara Mohawk Power, which is
moving aggressively to restructure contracts.
   In its ``Power Choice'' proposal, submitted to the New York Public
Service Commission last fall, NiMo offered to open up its service territory
to retail competition, but only if it could restructure the above-market
contracts, which it blames for much of its high rates (IPR, 20 Oct '95,
1).
   If it cannot restructure those pacts, NiMo said, it will seek to take
over projects through its power of eminent domain, then auction them off to
parties that would sell at market prices.
   In addition, NiMo raised the prospect that it might seek Chapter 11
protection under federal bankruptcy laws, which would most likely reduce
payments to NUGs.
   In response, S&P set a BBB- rating for the first mortgage bonds of
Selkirk Cogen Funding Corp., and affirmed that rating on Jan. 5, adding
that the rating outlook is now negative.
   The $392-million debt issue relates to the 332-MW Selkirk cogeneration
project, developed by Cogen Technologies, with a 79% stake, along with
Energy Initiatives, Tomen Power, and U.S. Generating.
   S&P fears the cash flows supporting the debt could be eroded if NiMo
forces a renegotiation of the power-sales contract, or pursues a Chapter 11
filing, it stated. The ratings agency reached that conclusion despite the
fact that the Selkirk project sells only 20% of its power to NiMo, with
most of the output going to Consolidated Edison.
   However, because of the minor reliance on NiMo, ``the project has the
flexibility to potentially absorb a partial loss of Niagara Mohawk
revenues, through contract renegotiation or otherwise, at the BBB- rating
level.'' Cogen Technologies could not be reached for comment by presstime.
   Also on Jan. 5, S&P lowered the ratings from BB to BBB- on senior
secured debt of Energy Investors Fund Funding Corp., and listed the outlook
as negative. Part of the downgrade for the $125-million issue stems from
NiMo's proposals, S&P said.
   Mark Tarini, treasurer of Boston-based Energy Investors Corp. (EIF),
told Independent Power Report the downgrade was not unexpected, since S&P
put the issue on ``CreditWatch'' after the NiMo proposal in October.
However, ``we were surprised they knocked us down two levels.''
   Tarini said the fund in question involves five projects connected with
NiMo: the High Falls and South Glens Falls projects, operated by Adirondack
Hydro, totaling 49 MW; a 58-MW hydro project operated by International
Paper; the Indeck/Olean Energy Center, an 80-MW gas-fired project owned and
operated by Indeck Energy Services in Olean, N.Y.; and the Salt City Energy
Venture, an 80-MW coal project in Solvay, N.Y., developed by CMS Generation
and other partners.
   In downgrading the EIF debt, S&P also cited the fund's investment in 71
MW of wind projects in California, which are owned and operated by
financially troubled Kenetech Corp. Kenetech has suffered financial
problems and a number of key executives including its CEO recently resigned
(IPR, 29 Dec '95, 3; 1 Dec '95, 1).
   If Kenetech recovers and NiMo does not pursue its threats, EIF plans to
lobby for an upgrading of the debt, Tarini said. However, he noted that
``downgrades are like gravity--once ratings go down, its hard to get out of
that hole.''

FORMOSA PLASTICS DEVELOPING TWO PROJECTS TOTALING 5,900 MW IN CHINA

   Formosa Plastics Co. of Taiwan said its Formosa Plastics Group (FPG)
will develop two coal-fired independent power plants totaling 5,900 MW in
the city of Zhangzhou in southern mainland China.
   The 3,500-MW and 2,400-MW plants will cost a total of $7-billion.
   Zhangzhou will provide a number of incentives, including 132-hectares of
land at no charge for five years and reduced charges for the following five
years.
   Formosa Plastics said it expected to bring in at least one equity
partner from the U.S. into the project.
   The company is also building an electric car battery manufacturing
facility in Zhangzhou in a joint venture with American Royal Co. Formosa
will produce the car batteries in mainland China and assemble the cars in
Taiwan.
   Formosa officials said the company is attempting to capitalize on the
experience it is gaining in Taiwan, where it is one of seven companies
selected in that country's first private power solicitation, and to take
advantage of the ``economic liberalization'' underway in China (IPR, 15 Dec
'95, 20).
   Under the name Mailiao Cogeneration Co., Formosa is developing a
1,350-MW, coal-fired plant on a Formosa site at Mailiao in Yunlin County,
Taiwan. The project is expected to be expanded to about 2,400 MW in the
years ahead. Formosa plans for the first phase to reach commercial
operation in 1999.
   Over the longer-term, FPG is also evaluating power project opportunities
in the Philippines.

EDF, ITALY'S EDISON AND FINEL CLOSE ON 600-MW ITALIAN GENERATING FIRM

   A joint venture of Italy's Edison SpA, Finel and Electricite de France
have completed the purchase of a 75% equity stake in the 600-MW Ilva
Servizi Energie (ISE), the power generation arm of Italy's state-owned
steel company Ilva.
   The 75% stake in ISE cost the two companies $220-million, which it paid
out of cash reserves without financing.
   ISE includes a 500-MW, gas-fired, cogeneration plant at Taranto and a
100-MW, gas-fired, cogeneration plant at Piombino in Tuscany. An additional
500-MW, combined-cycle unit is under construction at Taranto and a 170-MW,
combined-cycle unit is planned for Piombino.
   The Taranto plant supplies power and steam to the state-owned plastics
company, Ilva Laminati Piani.
   The additional generating units under construction will cost the
partners about $550-million to complete. Part of the those funds will come
from cash reserves and the remainder from traditional project financing,
which is currently being arranged with an undisclosed European bank.
   In early-1995, Edison and EdF were selected by the government over bids
by British Gas; Endesa of Spain; Mission Energy of the U.S. with Sondel of
Italy; Foster Wheeler Corp. of the U.S. and partners; and Waste Management
International (IPR, 27 Jan '95, 13).
   Edison is owned by Italian holding company Montedison SpA.

ENTERGY CLOSES $1.2-BILLION PURCHASE OF AUSTRALIAN DISTRIBUTOR CITIPOWER

   Entergy Corp. has reached financial closure on its (U.S.) $1.2-billion
acquisition of CitiPower Ltd., the Melbourne, Australia-based electric
power distributor (IPR, 1 Dec '95, 11).
   Entergy acquired CitiPower, its largest international investment to
date, through a solicitation released by the government of Victoria,
Australia.
   Entergy said Bank of America NT&SA, a subsidiary of BankAmerica Corp.,
was the loan arranger for the $914-million of debt financing used to
acquire CitiPower. Lead underwriters were ABN AMRO Australia Ltd., Bank of
America and Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Entergy contributed
$286-million of equity.
   Commonwealth Bank served as the facility agent.
   Entergy also noted co-lead underwriter was Credit Suisse, and
sub-underwriters were Australian & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and IBJ
Australia Bank Ltd.
   Syndication of the $914-million was scheduled to begin within the first
weeks of January.
   CitiPower, with a customer base of some 233,000 customers, serves
Melbourne and its surrounding suburbs.
   Entergy vice president and general manager for Australian activities,
Larry Folks, said, ``It is our intention to work closely with CitiPower's
management team over the coming months to continue establishing best
practices targets and marketing strategies.''
   The Victorian government's deregulation of the electricity industry
means electricity prices will continue to fall, in real terms, at least
until 2000, said Folks.
   Tom Wright, previously vice president, transmission and distribution
systems for Entergy, was appointed CitiPower chief executive officer,
replacing former CitiPower CEO Shane Breheny, who became a transition
advisor.
   CitiPower represents Entergy's first investment in Australia and its
first major international investment it is making alone. In joint ventures
with others, Entergy is active in Argentina, Chile, China, Pakistan and
Peru.

FIRST GAS IN TALKS FOR FINANCING 880-MW GAS PROJECT IN PHILIPPINES

   First Gas Holdings Corp., a joint venture of First Philippine Holdings
of Manila and British Gas, is holding talks with Export Risk Guarantee of
Switzerland, KfW of Germany, Hermes of Germany and the Export-Import Bank
of the U.S., for financing an 880-MW gas-fired project in Sta Rita,
Batangas province, south of Manila.
   The project, expected to cost $600-million, was recently doubled in size
from 440 MW (IPR, 1 Dec '95, 5).
   Gas will come from the offshore Camago-Malampaya field, the Philippines'
biggest oil and gas find, which will be developed by the Philippine units
of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Occidental Petroleum of the U.S.
   Meanwhile, three firms have been qualified to submit a final bid to
build the plant--Asea Brown Boveri, Siemens, and Raytheon Engineers &
Constructors, said Ernesto Pantangco, an official of First Philippine
Holdings Corp.
   The three pre-qualified firms have been asked to submit a final bid on
Jan. 26, with the winner to be announced in March, he said.
   The plant, expected to enter service in 1998, could be built as a single
880-MW facility or with two, 440-MW units, depending on the plan submitted
by the winning bidder.

PHILIPPINE DEVELOPER TO FLOAT BONDS VALUED AT $85-MILLION IN U.S. MARKETS

   First Private Power Corp., a unit of First Philippine Holdings, is set
to float $85-million worth of 12-year bonds in major cities in the United
States next month, a company official said Tuesday.
   Proceeds of the flotation will be used to refinance the short-term
foreign currency depository unit loans FPPC incurred to build the 215-MW
diesel power plant in Bauangtown in La Union Province, which entered
service last year.
   Money from the refinancing scheme will also be used as a partial equity
contribution for a 880-MW gas-fired facility, which is being built jointly
with British Gas (see story above; IPR, 1 Dec '95, 5).
   FPPC chief operating officer Ernesto Pantangco said the lead manager of
the flotation will be Salomon Brothers.
   The coupon rates will be pegged at between 325 and 375 basis points
above the seven-year U.S. Treasury bills. The bonds will have a maturity of
12 years.

UTILICORP, AIR PRODUCTS FORM LINK FOR GAS-FIRED PROJECTS IN MIDWEST

   UtiliCorp United has joined with Air Products & Chemicals to develop
gas-fired independent power projects in the Midwest. The partnership may
later expand its activities to other parts of the U.S. and overseas,
according to a UtiliCorp spokesman.
   UtiliCorp, based in Kansas City, Mo., operates Missouri Public Service
and WestPlains Energy divisions in Kansas and Colorado, along with some gas
utilities. It will pursue the joint projects through its unregulated UtilCo
Group subsidiary.
   Both companies have projects in operation and development, and have
already built two plants together: a 120-MW gas-fired cogeneration project
in Orlando, Fla., which began operating in 1993, selling power to Florida
Power and the Reedy Creek Improvement District; and a 49.9-MW coal-fired
cogeneration plant in Stockton, Calif., in service since 1988 and selling
electricity to Pacific Gas & Electric.
   The companies will focus on the Midwest because they have identified a
need for gas-fired capacity in the region, according to the UtiliCorp
spokesman. He added UtiliCorp brings a knowledge of the Midwest service
area, the regulatory environment and of other utilities in the region.
   Frank Costanza, UtiliCorp vice president of power services, told
Independent Power Report the partners may consider building uncommitted
``merchant plant'' components into some projects. However, until regulatory
uncertainties are resolved, the companies would want to secure purchasers
for most of the output.
   As competitive markets emerge, they may consider a purely merchant
approach--where plants are built without long-term contracts for the
output.
   Altogether, UtilCo Group has 319 MW of equity in 17 operating plants
totaling 800 MW from gas, coal waste and hydro sources, all in the U.S. In
addition, the company is developing a 60-MW plant in Jamaica.
   Air Products & Chemicals has 176 MW of equity in six operating plants
totaling more than 300 MW, including three in-house projects at its
industrial gas and chemical facilities.
   The company also has four projects in development, representing 650 to
725 MW, including a plant in the Czech Republic that is on hold pending the
country's restructuring efforts.
   Except for the Orlando project with UtilCo Group, all of Air Products'
plants involve coal or coal waste.
   Recently, Metropolitan Edison asked Air Products to restructure a 227-MW
coal project to gas in order to lower the capacity payments, but the
parties could not agree on terms, and Met-Ed agreed to buy out the contract
for up to $35-million (see story, page 10).

IDAHO POWER CONSIDERS RENEWABLES SUBSIDIARY; INDONESIA FIRST TARGET

   Idaho Power said it will decide by late spring whether to establish an
independent power subsidiary or energy services company to develop
photovoltaic systems and other renewable energy projects in international
markets.
   Indonesia is an immediate target because the government has begun a
Transmigration Program to encourage its citizens to relocate to outlying
regions, including some of the country's hundreds of islands. Indonesia has
the world's fourth largest population, with most people living in the major
cities.
   The government has earmarked $100-million for the electrification
component of its Transmigration Program. But rather than build a large
power plant on each island, which would be cost prohibitive, the government
is studying the possibility of small hydro and photovoltaics (PV).
   ``Our involvement in the preliminary stages of this project could be the
first step in a broad effort to expand our growth opportunities beyond what
has been considered typical for this company,'' said Joe Marshall, chief
executive officer.
   Idaho Power has been developing PV experience since 1993. In its first
two years, it installed sites in Idaho totaling 3 kW. In 1995 alone, it
installed 86 kW and sources said 1996 will be a pivotal year to decide its
strategy for the future.
   PV systems convert sunlight directly into electricity and can be used to
provide electricity to power water pumps, lighting or refrigeration.
   Idaho Power's engineers have traveled to Indonesia with Community Power
Corp., based in Virginia, to assess the potential for PV in that country.
Idaho Power also is interested in building small hydro, tapping its
considerable experience in the U.S.
   ``Developing PV systems could be a good niche for us internationally,''
said Larry Crowley, Idaho Power's senior manager of strategic planning.
``Our utility has developed a reputation for being a leader in PV
systems.''

CORDELL HULL, ERIC ZAUSNER ESTABLISH FIRM FOR INTERNATIONAL ENERGY ASSETS

   Cordell Hull, recently retired as executive vice president of Bechtel,
and Eric Zausner, a deputy administrator of the Dept. of Energy in the Ford
Administration, have formed Energy Asset Management LLC to develop and
acquire international energy infrastructure assets.
   Hull is chairman of the new company, based in San Francisco, and Zausner
is president. Zausner said it was too early to say more about the company,
which is just getting organized.
   One of Energy Asset Management's first projects is assisting Los
Angeles-based Pacific Enterprises International in acquiring a 12.5%
interest in two Argentine natural gas utility holding companies. Los
Angeles-based PEI, an affiliate of Southern California Gas, announced on
Jan. 2 that discussions and due diligence were proceeding with Sodigas
Pampana SA and Sodigas Sur SA.

TENNECO BUYS 10% OF AUSTRALIAN GAS, POWER DEVELOPMENT COMPANY

   Tenneco Power of Houston is taking a 10% equity stake in independent
power developer Energy Equity Corp. Ltd. (EEC) of Perth, Australia, which
has several projects underway (IPR, 3 Nov '95, 6).
   Tenneco Power, a unit of Tenneco Gas, will also take a seat on EEC's
board of directors. EEC's stock is traded on the Australian Stock
Exchange.
   In addition, Tenneco will take a 50% equity stake in EEC's 135-MW,
gas-fired Sulawesi independent power plant that will sell electricity to
Indonesia's state-owned electric utility, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN).
   Tenneco is also taking an equity stake in EEC's Indonesian Sengkang
onshore natural gas field, estimated to have proven and probable reserves
of 500-billion cubic feet.
   Tenneco is expected to pay about (U.S.) $21-million for the equity in
both projects.
   Financial close on the power project and pipeline is expected in
early-1996.
   As part of its agreement with EEC, Tenneco said it will arrange
financing for the projects.
   Construction of the Sulawesi power plant began in November, with
commercial operation scheduled for early-1997. Tenneco said the
power-purchase agreement with PLN is for a term of 20 years and was
concluded after negotiations between EEC and PLN.
   EEC also holds a 21-year, take-or-pay power-purchase agreement with the
Queensland Electricity Commission for a 37-MW, gas-fired power project. EEC
closed financing for the project with Barclays Bank Australia Ltd. and the
Bank of Western Australia Ltd.
   Separately, Tenneco plans possible power projects from the 470-mile,
16-inch, Moomba-Adelaide pipeline gas pipeline in Australia, which the
company recently purchased.
   Tenneco has separate interests in power projects in Brazil, Chile and
Taiwan.

THAILAND'S EGCO EYES PLANTS IN LAOS CHINA, VIETNAM, INDONESIA, MYANMAR

   One year after becoming a publicly traded company, the Electricity
Generating Public Co. (Egco) of Thailand, a spinoff of the government power
authority, is moving across Thai borders in search of new investments in
China, Myanmar, Indonesia, Vietnam and Laos.
   The company's initial impetus to build plants across the border in Laos
to fuel Thailand's growing demand has evolved into expansion for the sake
of investment, said Siwanan Na Nakorn, Egco executive director and deputy
managing director for new business ventures.
   In China, the company is exploring a joint venture with Huaneng Power
International, to build a 300-MW coal-fired plant in Shanghai.
   Huaneng would hold 70% of the equity and 30% would be owned by Egco.
Siwanan said Egco is working with Thai partners in the venture but declined
to disclose their identities.
   In Myanmar, Egco, in a consortium with the Petroleum Authority of
Thailand and British Gas, is likely to bid on a project that includes a gas
pipeline, a first-stage 200-MW power unit and fertilizer plant.
   In Vietnam, Egco plans to build a 200-MW combined-cycle plant at the
Amata City Bien Hoa industrial park, now under construction outside of Ho
Chi Min City. Egco's equity stake is still under negotiation.
   The Vietnamese government recently asked Egco to increase the initial
capacity of the plant, from 30 MW to 60 MW, to supply areas surrounding the
industrial park.
   Vietnam is also asking Egco to move up the starting date, from late-1997
to late-1996. But Egco and the Vietnamese have not arrived on the price of
the increased power and the company is seeking relief from a tax on diesel
fuel, since the gas pipeline to supply the plant will not be in place until
1998 or 1999.
   The project is a joint venture with Bangpakong Industrial Park of
Thailand.
   Egco is also negotiating with a mine concession holder in Indonesia to
build a mine-mouth coal-fired plant--or simply a mine--in Sumatra or
Kalimantan.
   In Laos, the company has been negotiating with Thai Lao Lignite Corp., a
concession holder, to build a lignite-fired plant in Hong Sa near the
Thai-Lao border. The plant, which would come on-line at 600 MW and
ultimately reach 1,200 MW, would supply Thailand. Siwanan said those
discussions are on hold because of differences over price.
   At home, Egco plans to bid on the next 1,000-MW independent power
solicitation held by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (IPR,
15 Dec '95, 8). EGAT is expected to announce a second 1,000-MW round in
1996, though many bidders in the 1995 request also bid for the second
round.
   Siwanan said the newly-privatized company sat out the first round to
avoid charges that it would receive preferential treatment from EGAT. As a
result of its first listing on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in November
1994, Egco is 50% publicly held, 48% controlled by EGAT and 2% is owned by
the Crown Property Bureau.
   The company's second public offering will be held in February or March
of 1996, and Siwanan said the sale would likely decrease EGAT's holdings to
40%. Eventually, EGAT's holdings are expected to decline to 25% or 30%, he
said.

MAHARASHSTRA OKAYS AMENDED PLAN FOR DABHOL PROJECT, NOW 2,450 MW

   The Maharashtra state administration on Jan. 8 approved a reformulated
version of Enron Development's Dabhol Power project, which is now planned
as a 2,450-MW plant.
   Maharashtra officials canceled Dabhol in August on charges of a lack of
transparency in the negotiation process and excessively high costs (IPR, 11
Aug '95, 13). Other project partners are General Electric and International
Generating Co. The state administration is calling for the Maharashtra
State Electricity Board to take a 30% stake.
   An earlier meeting on Jan. 6 convened expressly to decide on the Dabhol
plant and two other private power projects was rendered inconclusive after
``hardliners'' in the cabinet insisted the government ``beat down'' even
further recommendations made by a panel of experts appointed by the state.
   A panel's recommendations, submitted in November, had modified the
Dabhol project profile to reduce the tariff and costs of the project (IPR,
3 Nov '95, 6). The cabinet on Jan. 8 ``unanimously accepted most of them''
and has further modified others, state officials said.
   At the same meeting, the cabinet also approved two other private-sector
power projects, the 410-MW Patalganga project sponsored by India's Reliance
Group and the 595-MW, coal-fired Bhadravati project sponsored by the Ispat
Group.
   One of the key alterations to the panel's recommendations has been the
project's power tariff. The Maharashtra state administration has fixed the
power tariff for the Dabhol project at 5.45 cents/kWh, state officials
said. The expert panel had recommended a tariff of 5.5 cents/kWh.
   Chief Minister Manohar Joshi and his Shiv Sena party chief Bal Thackeray
had called for a tariff of 5.3 cents/kWh. Enron officials last week
indicated to the administration that the project would be commercially
unviable, if the tariff was reduced beyond 5.5 cents/kWh.
   Joshi also indicated that Dabhol Power Co., the project company, and the
Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the state-owned power utility, would
have to sign a new power-purchase agreement before work could resume at the
site of the stalled project.
   Similarly, the administration decided to accept ``in toto'' the
state-appointed expert panel's recommendation that while the project's
total power-generating capacity should be increased from 2,015 MW to
2,450-MW, project costs should be reduced from the originally approved
$1.3-million/MW to $800,000/MW, amounting to a total reduction of nearly
$300-million in fixed costs.
   This, state power officials pointed out, was lower than that of most
similar power projects being set up elsewhere in India, and the lowest
among those approved in Maharashtra state.
   In addition, the project's internal rate of return would be pegged at
21%, the level recommended by the panel, instead of the earlier 25%,
officials said.
   Joshi said the cabinet also approved the use of naphtha instead of
distillate oil for the first phase of the project, and liquefied natural
gas for the second phase, as in the original plan.
   The cabinet, he added, would expect Enron to take measures to ensure
that ``the environment isn't affected whatever the fuel deployed.''
   It also directed the Maharashtra administration not to allow work to
begin again on the first phase until ``all the necessary approvals,'' both
technical and environmental, have been obtained from the federal government
for both the first and second phases. This is expected to delay the
resumption of work at the project site even further.
   Joshi indicated the administration would not compensate Dabhol Power
``in any way'' for the delays that the project has so far incurred. The
first, 695-MW phase of the project was already under construction when the
newly elected state administration issued a work stoppage notice to Dabhol
Power on Aug. 4, 1995.
   Its subsequent revival was also delayed by nearly a month after the
state administration failed to meet its own self-imposed deadline of Dec.
10 to finalize its decision on the expert panel's recommendations (IPR, 29
Dec '95, 18).
   Dabhol Power had estimated that delays were resulting in cost overruns
of $250,000 a day, and had proposed that they should be shared equally by
the developers and the state administration.
   Chief Minister Joshi indicated on Jan. 8 that the Maharashtra State
Electricity Board would hold 30% of the equity of the Dabhol project.
   This, state officials said, would help MSEB have a say in the crucial
managerial decisions of the project, including the use of indigenous rather
than imported naphtha in order to cut costs, as well as in the case of gas
for the second phase, and project equipment for both phases.
   The equity share for MSEB was among the expert panel's recommendations
for the modified project. However, power industry analysts estimate that
the ``anomalous'' decision by the cabinet to insist on a 30% stake for MSEB
at a time when the federal trend suggests increasing privatization of the
power sector, is expected to cost the state about half of its projected
annual outlays, which could force the state to bring in a private Indian
company as a partner in the deal.
   Joshi said both the state and Enron would ``immediately take the
initiative'' to withdraw arbitration proceedings ongoing in a London court
(IPR, 1 Dec '95, 7). The next hearing had been scheduled for Jan. 15.
   Enron officials would not comment on the arbitration decision, pointing
out that the company had yet to receive a formal notice of the cabinet
approval.
   ``While it would be inappropriate for us to speculate on any conditions
until they are reviewed and considered in their entirety and the extent to
which they compare to the recommendations of the state-appointed expert
committee, we are certainly willing to consider recommendations that
provide for a mutually satisfactory project,'' said Enron officials quoting
from a prepared statement by Kenneth Lay, chairman and chief executive
officer of Enron Corp.

CHINA FORMS NEW AGENCY TO SEPARATE GOVERNMENT, PRIVATE ELECTRIC SECTORS

   China is creating an independent entity, National Power Corp. (NPC), to
separate the functions of government and the private electric sector.
   The Ministry of Power, which will be eliminated as it now functions when
NPC is up and running early this year, said NPC will allow China to step-up
its encouragement of foreign investment in the power sector, particularly
in the electricity-starved Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Yunnan and Guizhou
provinces and the autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia and Ningxia Hui.
   NPC is the first step in a multi-phased program to restructure the
Chinese power industry from central planning to a market economy for
electricity.
   Following completion of the national changes, the same restructuring
will be adopted for regional and provincial power administrations.
   All existing national electric power assets will be placed under the
authority of the Chinese State Council. As it is now known, the Ministry of
Power Industry will be dissolved, with its functions transferred to state
commissions, NPC and the China Electricity Council.
   Independently, the Federation of Chinese Power Enterprises will
coordinate work within the private sector.
   Also, the Chinese note that the new Electric Power Law is before members
of the ongoing 17th session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth
National People's Congress, China's top legislative body, for expected
approval in 1996.
   The new electric power laws are designed to encourage more domestic and
international investors in the power industry and correct
``insufficiencies'' in existing Chinese power policy.
   The new laws are intended to make sure all of China's resources be
utilized to produce electricity and encourage investors to use new
technology and equipment to build plants, especially cogeneration units.
Also, provisions call for protecting the rights of all investors, traders
and end-users.
   Use of the new laws will gradually unify the cost of electric power
across China.
   The government has also proposed development of a national 6,000-mile,
high-voltage transmission grid. The grid will expand, connect and control
the movement of electricity between the existing inter-provincial and
regional power grid networks.
   The grid is expected to eventually triple the current Chinese
transmission capacity of about 220,000 MW over a total of 106,000-miles and
will be centered around the Three Gorges hydro project on the Yangtze
River. Distribution networks in 35 key cities will be renovated. The
government wants the national grid in-place and operating by 2003.
   A new national grid company will operate the grid, dictating how excess
generation in one area is moved to areas lacking electricity. Development
of the grid is being handled by the China Electric Power Technology & Trade
Corp. of Beijing.

LAOS MAY ALLOW CHINA-THAI LINE IN COUNTRY FOR 1,500-MW PROJECT

   The Laotian government has indicated it may allow a transmission line
linking a 1,500-MW hydro project in China's Yunnan province with Thailand,
to be built on Laotian territory.
   Securing a third-country route for the transmission line is critical for
the project, which is now in the feasibility study stage, since China and
Thailand have no common land border and the project is envisioned to supply
Thailand. Thai officials have expressed concern that building the line
through Myanmar carries too many risks.
   In exchange for opening its territory to the line, Laos, which seeks to
be a major supplier of Thailand's booming energy market, has asked that
some of the power be used to supply Laotian towns and villages near the
line.
   During a meeting of Chinese, Laotian and Thai officials last month at
the ``Electric Power Forum,'' an Asian Development Bank-sponsored event,
Laotian officials agreed in principle to a study on constructing the power
transmission line through Laotian territory.
   Somboune Manolom, deputy director of the Laos Electricity Dept., said
Laos has no objection to the transmission line study, and suggested the
project could boost subregional cooperation.
   The feasibility study for the hydro plant is being conducted under a
joint venture by MDX Power of Bangkok, Thailand, and the Yunnan Electric
Power Bureau, which hold 48% and 52%, respectively. The plant study is
expected to be completed in late-1997.
   The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand has not yet committed
to purchase power from the project.
   One EGAT source said it is too early to know if the project will be
attractive. And a another EGAT official questioned whether the project
would offer energy at a competitive price, given the cost of transporting
power 185 miles from the northern Thai border. EGAT has no existing
agreements to buy power from China.
   But an MDX source said the company is pursuing the effort on the
``fairly strong belief that the project will be economically feasible and
mutually beneficial for the two countries.'' The transmission line is
unlikely to make up a major share of the project cost, he said.
   While MDX and Thai officials say that a Myanmar route for the
transmission line remains an option, Piyasvasti Amranand, head of
Thailand's National Energy Policy Office said it is ``too risky for us''
because the line would go through areas controlled by rebel groups. Also,
he said, some international lenders are reluctant to finance projects in
Myanmar.

SCEPTRE, PARTNERS TO REPOWER TWO SMALL PLANTS IN CHINA; MORE PLANNED

   Sceptre Power Co. of Santa Anna, Calif., has launched a joint venture to
repower two existing units totaling 42 MW in Jiangsu Province, China, with
hopes of repowering much larger plants in the future.
   With project partners New China Hong Kong Group Ltd. of Hong Kong and
Horizon Energy Development Inc., a unit of National Fuel Gas Co. of
Buffalo, N.Y., the 27-MW, coal-fired Wuxian Leekou plant will be expanded
to 39 MW and the 15-MW, coal-fired Jiangyin Sanfangxiang plant will be
increased to 24 MW. Combined costs of both projects are put at
$35.5-million.
   NCHK will hold about 50% of the project, while Sceptre Power and Horizon
Energy will hold the other 50%.
   Sceptre vice president for Asian project development L.W. Ken Kinnie
said both projects are scheduled to reach financial close during the first
quarter of this year and be complete by year-end.
   ``These projects are just to get our feet wet in China,'' Kinnie said.
Sceptre's goal in China is to undertake 10 to 15 similar repowering
projects--although the later ones will be larger--then list the entire
portfolio on the stock exchange of either Hong Kong or China.
   The company expects to have partners in each of the Chinese
undertakings.
   Sceptre began as an affiliate of Canada's Sceptre Resources, but
recently became independent. The company holds several agreements in China
for projects similar to those in Jiangsu Province, but Kinnie said details
will not be released until the project development process is more
advanced.
   The company is searching for other joint venture partners, Kinnie said.
   In a separate joint venture in Pakistan, Sceptre Power is nearing
financial close on a 157-MW, gas-fired project in Lahore (IPR, 29 Dec '95,
5). Partners in that project include Pakistan's Fauji Foundation and Intrag
of Wellesley, Mass.
   Other projects are sought in Brazil, Peru and elsewhere in South
America.

KEY PHILIPPINE SENATOR WANTS PROBE OF LINE DELAYS AFFECTING CEPA PLANT

   The president of the Philippine Senate said Monday he wants a probe on
why state-run National Power Corp. (Napocor) failed to provide needed
transmission lines, leading to delays in operation of two completed power
plants, including one built by Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA) of
Hong Kong, a unit of Hopewell Holdings.
   The plants involved are the 700-MW, coal-fired Pagbilao facility built
by CEPA, and the 300-MW Calaca coal plant owned by Napocor, both completed
in 1995.
   Senate President Neptali Gonzalez said the government has so far
incurred losses of $891.69-million due to the continued non-operation of
the two coal-fired facilities.
   Gonzalez filed a Senate resolution calling for an investigation on
``whether or not there is gross negligence or incompetence on the part of
the National Power Corporation...due to the delay in the construction of
the transmission lines and substations.''
   The two power plants ``were installed and commissioned as scheduled but
remain idle and inoperational due to unavailable transmission lines and
substations,'' Gonzalez said.
   However, Napocor vice president for projects management Antonio Corpuz
previously said that under a contract signed with CEPA, the transmission
lines needed for the Pagbilao plant should be ready by March 1996, at the
latest.
   Corpuz also said then that Napocor will not pay a single cent of the
$26.34-million being claimed by CEPA as an early completion bonus of
Pagbilao (IPR, 1 Dec '95, 5).
   A CEPA source said the ``misunderstanding'' with Napocor is being
discussed by both sides, and that the issue will be resolved ``very
soon.''

PHILIPPINES' NAPOCOR MAY SELL TWO WESTINGHOUSE TURBINES TO TEXACO

   The Philippines' National Power Corp. (Napocor) said Monday it may sell
to Texaco Inc. the two gas turbines totaling 320 MW to be delivered by
Westinghouse in 1997 as part of a package that settled a nuclear plant
dispute (IPR, 29 Dec '95, 18; 15 Dec '95, 10).
   The two new 501F combustion turbines worth $30-million each could be
used by Texaco for a 300-MW cogeneration plant planned in Batangas
province, south of Manila, said Napocor spokeswoman Jane Subang.
   Texaco officials were unavailable for comment.
   Westinghouse had been accused of bribing former president Ferdinand
Marcos in the early-1980s to secure the contract to build the allegedly
faulty nuclear plant in Bataan province, west of Manila.
   Westinghouse equipment and technology were banned in 1993 after talks on
a settlement failed. A $100-million out-of-court settlement that included
the delivery of the two gas turbines was reached recently paving the way
for the lifting of the ban.
   The sale of the gas turbines to Texaco has not yet been finalized,
Subang said. It is also possible the two turbines could be made part of the
planned bidding for a 1,200-MW gas-fired plant, she said (IPR, 15 Dec '95,
10).

PHILIPPINE INVESTMENT BOARD GRANTS INCENTIVES FOR TWO PROJECTS, 160 MW

   The Philippine government investment board has granted tax incentives to
two proposed geothermal projects totaling 160 MW that state-run Philippine
National Oil Co. plans to turn over to the private sector.
   The incentives, which include tax holidays and low duties on imported
equipment, were granted to draw the attention of private investors in the
proposed projects, the investment board said.
   The projects are the 120-MW Mount Labo geothermal plant in Camarines Sur
province, south of Manila, and the 40-MW Negros Geothermal Project in the
central province of Negros Occidental, said PNOC spokeswoman Debbie
Diokno.
   PNOC has not yet decided whether to offer the two projects to investors
on a build-operate-transfer or build-own-operate basis, she said.
   It is also eyeing the Japanese government's Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund as a source of funding for both projects, Diokno said.
   The Mount Labo project will be implemented in two phases: a 20-MW
facility scheduled for operation by June 1998, and a 100-MW unit by March
2000.
   The Negros power plant is scheduled for commissioning by August 1998.
   The government's investment board gave ``pioneer status'' to both
projects, entitling their proponents to a six-year income tax holiday, a 3%
duty on imported capital equipment and tax credits on local purchases of
machinery.

SOUTH KOREA LIFTS 750-MW SIZE CAP; 1,600-MW RFP NOW SEEN IN FEBRUARY

   South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE) has lifted
its earlier 750-MW private power project size limit, effective immediately
(IPR, 6 Oct '95, 12).
   The timing of the change coincides with the release of an often-delayed
international solicitation to be issued by Korea Electric Power Corp.
(KEPCO) in February for two 800-MW thermal projects, Younghungdong units 1
and 2, which will be developed on a build-own-operate basis.
   The formal request for proposals was expected before the end of 1995,
but was delayed. The RFP was originally scheduled to be released in June
1995. All delays were blamed on personnel changes at the top of MOTIE.
   The cost of each 800 MW is placed between $650-million and
$700-million.
   The policy change means the only restriction faced by private power
developers is a 50% limitation on foreign ownership. Also, nuclear projects
are barred.
   According to a tentative schedule, MOTIE will receive and evaluate
proposals in early-1996 with selection of developers set for July 1996.
Power-purchase agreements will be signed in August 1996, following
negotiations. Development of selected projects will begin in September
1996.
   Those dates could slip into the future.
   Virtually all private companies will be able to compete for the
projects, if the ratio of their net worth to capital during the previous
three years is at least 20% and they have some technical capacity for power
projects.
   KEPCO may not bid for the projects, but will buy the power under a
long-term, power-purchase agreement. Power-purchase negotiations will be
between the selected bidders and KEPCO, which is warning prospective
bidders it will not pay a tariff higher than the cost of power from the
utility's comparable existing plants.
   Successful bidders will be guaranteed returns of 11%, compared to the 9%
guaranteed to KEPCO.
   Separate successful bidders will be selected for each project, and the
same company will not be allowed to participate in both generating plants.
South Korea's largest and most powerful industrial groups are expected to
offer strong competition for the projects.
   Further solicitations after the two 800-MW plants are almost certain
because electricity demand in South Korea is projected to average 5.5%
between 1996 and 2006.
   Currently, installed capacity in South Korea is about 31,810 MW, with
30,188 MW generated by KEPCO. About 62% is fueled by oil, coal or natural
gas, 28.7% is nuclear power and 9.3% is hydroelectric.

QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA, ENCOURAGING BAGASSE PLANTS UNDER NEW PROGRAM

   Queensland, Australia, is promoting bagasse-fired, waste-to-energy
cogeneration plants among the state's sugar mills and is encouraging
domestic and international joint venture partners.
   Under the just-created Queensland Sugar Power Pool Agreement, power
produced by using the waste products of making sugar will be purchased at
special tariffs under a long-term agreement by the Queensland Transmission
& Supply Corp. (QT&SC) starting January 1998.
   Up to 95 MW will be purchased by (QT&SC) when the program begins, but by
2002, the limit will increase to 200 MW, said Queensland energy minister
Tony McGrady.
   The mills will make use of the thermal energy created by the
cogeneration units, but only a very small portion of the electric
generation.
   The program is an effort by the government to explore ``all avenues of
environmentally friendly generation options,'' McGrady said.
   The effort is expected to generate worldwide interest, the government
said, and various private sector companies are welcome to participate, if
they can strike a deal with one of the sugar mills agreeing to provide
fuel.
   So far, sugar mills participating in the project include the three CSR
Ltd. mills located at Invicta, Kalamia and Inkerman and the mills of South
Johnstone and Maryborough. The mills are the initial members of the
Queensland Sugar Power Pool Agreement, but others are expected to join.
   Bagasse is the part of the cane stalk remaining after the milling
process.

NATIONAL POWER, POWERGEN MAY FACE MORE AGENCY-ORDERED PLANT SELL-OFFS

   U.K. generation companies National Power and PowerGen may be forced to
sell additional plants beyond the already-required 6,000 MW, if their
pending acquisitions of regional electric companies (RECs) are cleared.
   PowerGen has bid to acquire Midlands Electricity (IPR, 22 Sept '95, 1)
and National Power has proposed buying Southern Electric (IPR, 6 Oct '95,
13). Both bids, accepted by the RECs, have been referred to the Monopolies
& Mergers Commission (IPR, 1 Dec '95, 17). A decision is expected by March
22.
   London Electricity is pressing industry regulator Stephen Littlechild,
director of the Office of Electricity Regulation (OFFER), for a reduction
in the generating capacity of PowerGen and National Power.
   According to a London Electricity spokesman, there is considerable
concern at the size and potential market share of the vertically integrated
groups. ``We are not against vertical integration,'' he said, ``but it must
not be at the expense of stifling other suppliers. We would like to see
more generators and suppliers rather than less, which may happen if these
mergers go ahead.''
   PowerGen is already disposing of 2,000 MW of capacity to the Eastern
Group, while National Power is evaluating bids from Enron, AES Corp.,
Eastern Group and Mission Energy for the 2,000-MW plant at West Burton in
Nottinghamshire and two, 1,000-MW plants at Ironbridge in Shropsire and
Rugeley in Staffordshire (IPR, 22 Sept '95, 8; 6 Oct '95, 1).
   National Power forecasts its transaction will be complete by March 31.
All four bidders want to acquire the three plants, but it is possible they
will be sold separately to individual bidders.
   However, London Electricity said further sales are necessary to enable
more players to enter the market, although the two generators point to
their decline in market share since privatization and insist that further
sales are unnecessary.
   The RECs are also concerned about the possible effects on the power
pool. Southeast distributor Seeboard said the workings of the pool should
be scrutinized along with other commercial issues and the voting structure
to ensure that bigger groups do not dominate the market.

UKRAINE GETS $1.8-BILLION WESTERN AID FOR POWER; BIG ABB PROJECT DEAD

   A protocol signed by the Ukraine and the ``G-7'' Western industrial
nations in Ottawa commits the West to provide $1.8-billion in loans for
power plant construction and rehabilitation projects in the Ukraine in
return for closure of 3,000 MW of remaining nuclear capacity at the
Chernobyl site by 2000.
   The west will also contribute $498-million towards Chernobyl cleanup and
decommissioning costs.
   The protocol calls for much of the replacement power funding to be spent
on completion of two 1,000-MW reactors at Khmelnitsky and Rovno and the
rest to go into thermal and hydro plant rehabilitation, pumped-storage
projects and energy conservation.
   The agreement to fund the nuclear plants officially ends chances for
construction at this time of a 2,300-MW, gas-fired combustion turbine
project near the Chernobyl site that was proposed in May 1995 by a
consortium led by Asea Brown Boveri (IPR, 16 June '95, 18).
   The ABB group also included CMS Generation, Kawasaki, Skanska AB of
Sweden, Mannesmananlangebau of Germany and Danish Power as well as local
Ukranian groups.
   The group proposed a crash construction schedule, which would allow the
project to start generating power within 24 months of construction start
and be fully completed within 36 months. They said this would be the best
way to insure new power supplies in time for the closure deadline of 2000.
   However, the project met stiff resistance inside the Ukraine from
supporters of nuclear power and the national utility Minenergo. Critics
argued the country could not afford the cost of gas from Russia that would
be needed to fuel the plant. The Ukraine has had chronic problems paying
Russia for both gas and power supplies in recent years.
   The gas project also was based on initial estimates the west would
provide up to $4-billion for the Chernobyl cleanup and replacement power
projects. However, as talks continued during 1995, it became clear the west
was not willing to commit to such a large sum.
   An ABB spokesman in Zurich said the gas project clearly now had a ``low
priority'' in Ukrainian planning and that his company was looking at
participation in various plant rehabilitation projects. Siemens of Germany
has already been active in promoting such projects and it is possible ABB
will team with Siemens.
   The European Community has already funded a study by Electricite de
France, Tractebel Engineering and IVO of Finland on what will be needed to
complete work on the two nuclear plants.
   The Dec. 20, 1995, protocol also contains language committing the
Ukraine to continue developing a ``financially sound electric power market
with market-based pricing'' that will encourage energy conservation and
attract international investment.

U.K.'S NATIONAL POWER PLANS 60-MW PROJECT IN UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

   The U.K.'s National Power has signed a memorandum of understanding with
Ajman, a sheikdom operating as part of the federation of United Arab
Emirates (UAE), to build, own and operate a $120-million, 50-MW to 60-MW,
desalination and power plant.
   National Power will hold a 49% equity stake in the project, while a
domestic partner, Bin Sofan Trading Co., is expected to hold 51%.
   When complete, the project will also produce about 5-million gallons/day
of desalinated sea water.
   The project is considered the first private power plant in the UAE and
the first power project in Ajman.
   National Power is holding power-purchase agreement negotiations with the
UAE's Ministry of Electricity & Water. The agency is responsible for
electricity supplies in some of the UAE's northern emirates, including
Ajman, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah and Umm al-Quwain.
   Within the UAE, the Abu Dhabi Dept. of Water & Electricity, the Dubai
Electricity & Water Authority, and the Sharjah Water & Electricity
Department supply power to their respective areas.
   UAE power demand is projected to increase to 6,900 MW by 1999, based on
load growth of about 20% annually. Current installed capacity is about
4,350 MW, produced by six gas-fired power stations and seven small
generating units.
   About 1,440 MW of government-owned projects are in some stage of
construction. Many of the planned projects are associated with desalination
plants.
   Also, the Ministry of Electricity & Water and the Dubai Electricity &
Water Authority are separately evaluating prospects for several more
projects, totaling about 710 MW.
   Within the UAE, the government is planning a large expansion of
liquefied natural gas production and transportation facilities. The
expansion, estimated to cost about $3-billion, will be undertaken by the
Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Co..
   The United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven small semi-autonomous
principalities located on the Persian Gulf.

MET-ED MAY PAY UP TO $35-MILLION TO KILL 227-MW AIR PRODUCTS PACT

   Air Products & Chemicals of Allentown, Pa., has ended talks with
Metropolitan Edison aimed at restructuring the contract for a planned
227-MW coal project (IPR, 6 Oct '95, 7).
   After three months, the companies could not agree on new terms and will
now negotiate a buyout that could reach $35-million to cover Air Products'
development costs.
   To replace the capacity and 100 MW from another recent buyout, Met-Ed
may seek new supplies, a spokesman said.
   Air Products was pursuing the project strictly as a developer, and would
have operated it at the site of the P.H. Glatfelter paper company in York
County, selling steam to the mill and power to Met-Ed, a unit of General
Public Utilities.
   Although Air Products worked alone, the project was being developed
under the name York County Energy Partners L.P., because it planned to seek
limited partners once the plant was operational.
   According to Brad Hahn, Air Products director of business development,
the company completed all of the design work and had received an air permit
from the Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection, as well as a
favorable environmental impact statement (EIS) from the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.
   He could not estimate how much the company spent on development costs,
but said it would be covered by the final buyout figure.
   When the parties began talking in September, Met-Ed estimated the
existing contract would cost $940-million above market rates during its
25-year term. It proposed that Air Products switch its design from coal to
gas, since that would reduce capacity rates.
   The utility also offered to let the developer participate in GPU's new
gas pool, which was developed for utility peakers, but is being made
available to non-utility generators who agree to renegotiate contracts.
   However, ``it became clear that we would not be able to agree,'' Hahn
told Independent Power Report. The main sticking point was contract length,
since Met-Ed wanted only eight to 10 years, while Air Products preferred a
term closer to the original 25 years. Other details also blocked the
agreement, he added.
   A Met-Ed spokesman said the utility will begin considering alternatives
to replace the 227 MW, as well as the 100 MW it lost when it bought out the
Crown/Vista coal contact from partners Mission Energy, Ahlstrom Development
and Entergy Power Development for $30-million (IPR, 8 Sept '95, 5).
   Met-Ed agreed to that buyout because it saw the contract costing
$298-million over market rates during its 20-year life.
   The spokesman did not say whether Met-Ed would seek bids for new
supplies.
   Air Products & Chemicals has equity stakes of 176 MW in seven operating
plants that produce 303 MW, including three in-house projects. The firm
also has four projects in development, representing about 650 MW to 725 MW,
including a coal gasification plant in the Czech Republic that is currently
on hold.

PANDA TO REFILE LAWSUIT CHARGING FLA. POWER BLOCKED 115-MW PROJECT

   Panda Energy, after voluntarily withdrawing its $345-million federal
suit against Florida Power without prejudice in mid-December, said it will
file the suit again (Case No. 95-992-CIV-T-24 C) (IPR, 11 Aug '95, 1).
   The suit alleged the utility unfairly interfered with construction of a
115-MW cogeneration plant in Polk County, which was to supply Florida Power
with 74.9 MW of firm power under a standard-offer contract.
   Florida Power has since filed a countersuit against Panda in the same
court, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division
(Case No. 95-2145-CIV-T-25-B). In addition, the state Public Service
Commission denied two requests made by Panda in a related action.
   Panda's general counsel Bill Nordlund said the withdrawal was a
strategic move, ``and we still plan to prosecute this matter and move
forward on it. I can't comment on when or what court. We don't want to give
an advance of our intentions to the other side.''
   The countersuit filed by Florida Power at the end of December sought
declaratory judgments against the facts alleged in Panda's suit, which was
a safeguard in case Panda refiled the case, according to Florida Power
attorney James Fama.
   Florida Power asked the court to issue declaratory judgments ruling
that:
   Panda did not have a superior legal right to negotiate for a natural gas
transmission contract with the city of Lakeland, and that the utility did
not interfere with Panda's rights with the city;
   Panda was not entitled to a standard-offer contract if it builds a unit
larger than 75 MW, the largest allowed under PSC rules;
   Panda was not entitled to rates under a standard-offer contract beyond
December 2016, rather than 2026 as Panda sought;
   Panda breached its contract by failing to begin construction on the
unit, which was scheduled to go on line in January 1997;
   The utility also asked the court to declare remedies to Florida Power
from Panda's breach, plus additional relief.
   On Jan. 3, the PSC refused to reconsider a decision the PSC made on Dec.
5, which said the PSC had jurisdiction over standard-offer contracts and
the Florida Power/Panda dispute. It also refused to grant Panda a 90-day
extension beyond Jan. 5 to file testimony in that case (Docket No.
950110-EI).
   As a result, a hearing at the PSC was scheduled for Feb. 19, a staff
recommendation was due April 18, and the commission was scheduled to vote
on April 30.
   Nordlund said Panda made the deadline for filing testimony Jan. 5, and
added, ``We think Florida Power's suit is ludicrous.''

ENERGY INITIATIVES BEATS FLA. POWER IN COURT ON RATES FOR 112-MW PLANT

   Energy Initiatives Inc. won a partial summary judgment Jan. 4 in a case
against Florida Power concerning rates for the developer's 112-MW
cogeneration plant in Umatilla, Fla.
   The project company, Lake Cogen, said the utility was paying it on an
as-available basis at times when it should have been paying for firm
capacity and energy.
   Florida Power attorney James Fama confirmed two other non-utility
generators, Pasco Cogen, also 112 MW and owned by Energy Initiatives, and
the 120-MW Orlando Cogen, developed by Air Products & Chemicals, have
similar court actions pending.
   The Lake Cogen case, filed in state circuit court in Lake County, will
determine whether firm capacity payments should be made based on a model
used by Florida Power, or a separate method Lake Cogen said was called for
in the contract (Case No. 94354 CA-01, Division 8).
   Florida Power pays NUGs both capacity and energy payments when the
theoretically avoided generating unit would operate, but only as-available
or energy payments if the avoided unit would have been off line.
   Florida Power claimed a theoretically avoided 500-MW pulverized coal
plant equipped with a scrubber, which was used to determine capacity and
energy payments, would be used by the utility based on four criteria to
determine when the plant would be dispatched on an economic basis.
   The four parameters were the cost of variable operations and
maintenance, the price of coal, the heat rate of the unit, and a fuel
multiplier of 1, the last of which Fama said was not a significant factor.
   In its motion, Lake Cogen contended other factors, such as environmental
compliance, should be used in determining economic dispatchability of a
generating unit. It said an actual, operating plant should be used for
comparison, which would be Florida Power's coal-fired Crystal River units 1
and 2.
   Judge Don Briggs ruled the parameters for dispatchability should be
based on a real unit and not only the four Florida Power was using. He
ordered a more accurate model be developed, which would be used to
determine how much Lake Cogen should be paid.
   That cost information will be compared to actual payments, which could
be used to determine an award at a later date, assuming the model shows
Lake Cogen was underpaid. A schedule for further proceedings was not set.
   Kelly Tomblin, legal director for Energy Initiatives, a unit of General
Public Utilities, said Florida Power changed the method of payment in
August 1994. Although the developer receives payments for firm capacity and
as-available sales, firm capacity payments ``have been very limited
recently,'' she said.
   ``We believe Florida Power always believed it would be based on a real
operating unit and the judge agreed,'' Tomblin said. ``We think it is good
for cogenerators and good for us in Florida.''
   Tomblin said it would be very difficult to estimate the amount of
damages Florida Power might have to pay until after the judge approves the
final modeling and makes a ruling.

NIMO: PURPA PREEMPTS NEW YORK LAW REQUIRING TAX REIMBURSEMENT TO QFS

   Niagara Mohawk Power has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
to act against a New York State law that requires NiMo to pay natural gas
tax reimbursements to qualifying facilities.
   NiMo has paid almost $18-million in reimbursements since the law was
passed in 1991, it said.
   The company wants FERC to bring an enforcement action against the New
York Public Service Commission to bar it from implementing the law, which
directs the PSC to order utilities to reimburse QFs for natural gas import
tax payments that the state requires QFs to pay on fuel used to generate
power sold to the utilities.
   According to NiMo, the state law is preempted by the Public Utility
Regulatory Policies Act and FERC's PURPA rules. ``The PSC cannot both obey
the New York statute and heed its obligations under Sec. 210 of PURPA,''
NiMo said (Docket No. EL96-26).
   The legislature imposed a monthly ``privilege tax'' on certain gas
importers amounting to 4.25% of the price paid for gas imported into the
state for use or consumption. For cogenerators, the amount of gas taxed is
that used in producing power for sale to utilities, not the gas used to
produce power or steam for steam hosts.
   Utilities may pass the payments through in fuel cost adjustments.
   NiMo itself paid about $7.2-million in 1994 and $4.8-million in 1995
through Sept. 30. The company projected it will pay between $7.2-million in
1996 and $13.5-million in 2006.
   FERC's 1995 rulings in cases involving Connecticut Power & Light (IPR,
27 Jan '95, 10) and Southern California Edison (IPR, 24 March '95, 4)
``leave no room for doubt that this New York statute is preempted'' because
it requires utilities to pay above avoided-cost rates to QFs, NiMo said
(IPR, 21 April '95, 1; 24 March '95, 1).

N.Y. JUDGE SEES ISO AS KEY IN MOVE TO WHOLESALE COMPETITION, ACCESS

   An administrative law judge has recommended New York set up an
independent system operator to formalize wholesale competition and ensure a
smooth transition to retail competition.
   Her recommended decision in the state's Competitive Opportunities
proceeding also calls for separating transmission and distribution from
generation and for recovering stranded costs with an access charge imposed
by a distribution company.
   Administrative law judge Judith Lee of the state's Dept. of Public
Service filed her recommendation Dec. 22 with Ronald Liberty, deputy
director for the Energy and Water Division. Subject to review by the Public
Service Commission, it aims to lower New York's high electricity rates and
keep industry in the state.
   Key parts of the more than 200-page review are:
   -- Stranded costs ``may be made unrecoverable by the transition from
regulation to a competitive market for electricity.'' These costs could be
recovered by a separate mechanism outside the market, such as a
non-bypassable access charge or wires charge imposed by a distribution
company.
   -- Transmission and distribution should be separate from generation
``to limit the exercise of market power,'' and T&D companies will need to
serve all would-be buyers in the short term.
   Lee said she saw as ``critical'' the reliability of the bulk power
system, noting that it should not be sacrificed in any way to achieve the
potential price reduction that may be associated with a system of retail
access. Therefore, ``effective competition at the wholesale level should be
established first, with an eye toward adding retail access as rapidly as
possible once a market is established and reliability is ensured.''
   No timetable for the ``as rapidly as possible'' transition to retail
access is available, a PSC spokesperson told Independent Power Report.
   Lee's recommendation was a ``tremendous disappointment'' to New York
industrials ``and to any advocate of full and open retail competition,''
said Barbara Brenner, counsel to Multiple Interveners, the industrial users
group. ``It delays, without schedule, retail competition and, in fact,
appears to delay even the implementation of wholesale competition for two
years.''

PACIFIC GENERATION BUYS 25% INTEREST IN 100-MW ONTARIO PLANT FROM DESTEC

   Pacific Generation, a unit of PacifiCorp, has acquired a 25% interest in
the 100-MW Kingston cogeneration project under construction in Ontario,
Canada, from Destec Energy Inc.
   Destec retains 50% ownership in the gas-fired project, located in
Ernestown Township. The plant will supply power to the Ontario Hydro grid
and process heat to Celanese Canada's Millhaven polyester plant.
   PanCanadian Petroleum holds the remaining 25% interest and will supply
natural gas to the plant, which will enter service in late-1996.
   Pacific Generation and Destec are already partners in the
almost-completed 240-MW Crockett cogeneration plant near San Francisco,
which will begin operation in April. Other partners are Tomen Power and
Energy Investors Fund. Pacific Gas & Electric will buy the power.
   ``The Kingston project fits our plan for growing our business through
acquisition of existing facilities and the development of new power
projects,'' said John Miller, Pacific Generation president and chief
executive officer.
   In October, Miller had said that after several years of being in a
``holding pattern,'' his company intended to aggressively expand its
independent power activities (IPR, 6 Oct '95, 14). In November, the company
said it was beefing up its top management by hiring five people for
domestic and international expansion (IPR, 17 Nov '95, 3).
   The company, based in Portland, Ore., was formed in 1989 with the merger
of Pacific Power & Light and Utah Power & Light. Ownership and operating
interests of projects developed by Pacific P&L affiliate Onsite Energy Inc.
and UP&L affiliate Energy National Inc. were transferred to Pacific
Generation.
   Pacific Generation holds an interest in 11 power plants in the U.S.
totaling 703 MW. Destec has equity in 19 operating plants totaling 2,810 MW
and has seven projects with over 1,700 MW in construction or advanced
development.

MISSION FORMALLY EXITS 400-MW PROJECT AT WEYERHAEUSER MILL IN WASH. STATE

   Weyerhaeuser Co. of Longview, Wash., and Mission Energy told Washington
state regulators they have reached a stipulated agreement over development
of a 400-MW, gas-fired cogeneration plant, that would give Weyco full
rights to develop the plant alone at its Longview paper mill (IPR, 1 Dec
'95, 13; 29 Jan '93, 1).
   Weyco asked the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council to amend its
certification agreement to reflect its decision to proceed alone.
   It also asked for an amendment that would extend the agreement for 18
months.
   EFSEC will make a decision in February on the request. If the council
approves the deal, ``we will require the governor to sign the new
agreement,'' said Jason Zeller, EFSEC manager.
   Zeller said the two companies reached a stipulated pact after being
pressured by EFSEC to resolve their differences on their own. ``We were
unhappy'' that the companies had been unable to settle their dispute over
the development of the project, he said. The original permit expired in
August.
   Weyco officials indicated to the council they were still interested in
developing the plant eventually, even though the company recently agreed to
purchase 150 MW from the Bonneville Power Administration to cover part of
its 300-MW load at the Longview mill.

AES, ONTARIO HYDRO UNIT IN TALKS TO BUY 2,700-MW ARGENTINE PLANT

   A strategic alliance of Ontario Hydro International, a unit of Ontario
Hydro, and AES Corp. of Arlington, Va., has opened talks with the
government of Argentina concerning the acquisition of the 2,700-MW Yacyreta
hydro project, now under construction on the Parana River, which forms the
border between Argentina and Paraguay.
   Other unidentified developers have also opened discussions on the
project, jointly owned by the governments of Argentina and Paraguay.
   Previously, an international solicitation was scheduled for release in
August 1995, but was not issued (IPR, 30 June '95, 1).
   Analysts said it is unlikely Ontario Hydro and AES could acquire the
plant via a negotiations, and would more likely have to compete in an
international solicitation open to all.
   The project consists of 20 turbines of 135 MW each.
   Officials of Ontario Hydro International and AES met recently with
Argentine government officials about the project.
   Ontario Hydro officials said it and AES may form a consortium to enter a
bid for Yacyreta when and if it is offered via a solicitation.
   Both companies have equity in other South American electric projects.
   The plant will be completed by the middle of 1998.
   Argentine officials confirmed representatives of the two companies met
with energy officials, but nothing substantive came of the meeting.
Meetings with other private developers are taking place.
   Separately, a consortium known as LISTA will build and operate a
transmission system to move power generated by the Yacyreta plant.
   LISTA consists of Jose Cartellone Construcciones Civiles SA
(Cartellone), Sideco Americana SA (Sidecdeco), Italy's Impresa Frate SpA.
(Frate), Pirelli Consultora Conductores e Instalaciones SA (Pirelli),
Construccion Obras de Ingenieria SA (Codi), and Electroingenieria SA.

TAIWAN FIRM PROPOSES 1,010-MW BOT HYDRO PROJECT IN HONDURAS

   Oslow Associates Ltd. of Taiwan has proposed to the government of
Honduras development of a $2-billion, 1,010-MW hydroelectric project on a
build-operate-transfer basis.
   Oslow, a large trading company based in Taiwan, submitted the proposal
following a government trade mission to Honduras.
   The Honduran government tentatively accepted the proposal, pending
completion of a number of subsequent agreements.
   The project will be financed through government-backed loans in Taiwan
and with funds from foreign banks.
   Additional equity partners are expected to be involved in the project,
but none have been identified, Honduran officials said.
   Load growth is high in Honduras, but the country is relatively small.
Installed capacity--two-thirds hydro--is less than 600 MW. Honduras is said
to have an estimated untapped hydro potential of about 3,600 MW.
   Overall, up to 800 MW could be available to the private sector in
Honduras by 1999.
   If the 1,010-MW hydro project is completed, it could export power to
other countries in Central America via the 1,100-mile, high-tension
transmission grid known as the Electricity Interconnection System for
Central America, now in development.
   The Inter-American Development Bank is expected to eventually provide a
$157-million syndicated loan to partially finance the transmission grid.
   The government of Taiwan also agreed to provide undisclosed financing
for the transmission project, which would allow each country to supply or
buy electricity from all others, and serve as an emergency electric supply
backup.
   Recently, Mosbacher Power Group (MPG) of Houston launched pursuit of
smaller independent power projects in Honduras, mostly within the
industrial power niche for projects between 20 MW and 50 MW (IPR, 17 Nov
'95, 16).

SPAIN'S ENDESA SELLS 9.7% OF EDENOR IN ARGENTINA FOR ABOUT $76-MILLION

   Spanish electric utility Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA (Endesa)
said its Endesa Group sold a 9.7% stake in Argentine electricity
distribution company Edenor to Banco Santander de Negocios for about (U.S.)
$76-million.
   Less than two weeks earlier, Endesa paid $156-million to expand its
equity stake in Edenor by 19.5 percentage points, pushing total holdings to
31% (IPR, 29 Dec '95, 12). Endesa bought that piece of Edenor from the
Argentine government.
   Endesa said the sale to Banco Santander de Negocios was made for
financial reasons.
   Endesa said it will maintain its 21.3% holdings in Edenor with joint
venture partners, Astra CAPSA of Argentina, Electricite de France, Societe
D'Amenagement Urbain et Rural of France, Empresa Nacional Hidroelectrica
Ribargozana of Spain, and J.P. Morgan.
   Endesa officials said the company remains strongly interested in
additional equity roles in Latin American electricity projects.

CITY ATTORNEY BLASTS TOLEDO EDISON'S NUMEROUS SPECIAL INDUSTRIAL DISCOUNTS

   Toledo Edison's practice of negotiating special discount contracts with
large industrials is coming under heavy fire from the city of Toledo as the
utility's $35.2-million electric rate case moves slowly through the Ohio
Public Utilities Commission.
   Cleveland Electric Illuminating, a Centerior Energy subsidiary as is
Toledo Edison, is seeking a $83-million rate hike. Together, the two
companies whose electric rates already are among the highest in the Midwest
are asking for $118-million (Case No. 95-300-EL-AIR) (IEB, 21 April '95,
5).
   In written comments filed recently with the PUC, the city of Toledo took
a dim view of Toledo Ed's request, especially in light of what the city
claims is an over-reliance on special contracts by the utility.
   Toledo city attorney Kerry Bruce objected to a recent PUC staff report
that recommended the commission approve the full $118-million increase for
the Centerior companies. The report, Bruce said, ``fails to consider
whether the number of incentive contracts and the magnitude of the
discounts provided violate the prohibition (under Ohio law) against the
setting of special rates.''
   According to Bruce, the report also ``fails to determine whether the
extensive use of incentive contracts to industrial customers exceeds the
purpose of retaining load and instead establishes a rate which is unjustly
discriminatory and unjustly preferential'' in violation of state law.
   Bruce asserted that more than 71% of the potential customers and 92% of
the potential kWh sales under Toledo Edison's Large Power Rate PV-44 are on
special contracts. Under such a scenario, ``it is not clear what purpose
the tariff rate serves,'' he said.
   A Toledo Edison spokeswoman acknowledged that ``yes, we do have a large
number of our large load customers on special contracts.'' She said special
contracts often are the best way to address the individual needs of
customers, not just with price but with other utility services as well.
   Of the 87 large industrials that qualify for Toledo Edison's PV-44 rate,
62 either have special contracts or are receiving the utility's economic
development rates, she confirmed. Under the PV-44 rate, a primary
transmission customer pays a monthly demand charge of $18.25/kVA for the
first 1,000 kVA, $18.05/kVA for the next 29,000 kVA and $17.16/kVA for each
additional kVA. For sub-transmission, the comparable charges per kVA are
$17.48, $17.20 and $16.18.
   Despite the relatively high rate, the number of special contracts, Bruce
told Industrial Energy Bulletin, is simply unacceptable. ``It violates
ratemaking policy to have more load under special contracts than under a
tariff,'' he said. ``It shows the company is subject to market pressures
and really can't implement its regulatory rate.''
   The Toledo Edison spokeswoman defended the special contracts.
``Obviously, it is a competitive marketplace,'' she said. Her company
``recognizes the need to keep large customers in our service area. It's
important to keep those jobs and economic development here instead of
letting it leave.''
   Bruce summed up the city's position by insisting that the utility should
not increase its rates ``because it's bad for business.'' Instead of asking
customers to pay an additional $118-million annually, both Toledo Edison
and CEI should eliminate heir dividend, he said.

ELCON DETAILS PLAN FOR RESTRUCTURING, ISSUES `ROAD MAP' TO COMPETITIVE ERA

   Industrials' major national representative on electric power issues, the
Electricity Consumers Resource Council, last week issued its detailed
``Road Map for the Transition,'' which fills in gaps that critics found in
its ``Blueprint for Customer Choice'' (IEB, 6 Oct '95, 1).
   The biggest feature of the transition document is a plan for dealing
with utilities' stranded investment. Under ELCON's proposal, utilities
would be able to recover up to 50% of their costs stranded by competition,
but in practice, few if any would be able to get back that much.
   The Edison Electric Institute quickly denounced the road map as ``full
of dead ends and some pretty deep potholes.'' EEI criticized the proposal
as a one-size-fits-all imposition of a federal structure on the country's
electric system that will benefit ELCON's members ``at the expense of
everyone else.''
   Still, the road map puts ELCON once again in the vanguard of the
restructuring movement; its proposal is the first one offered in such
detail for consideration by Congress and states as they approach major
decisions this year and next. It is surely not the last, however.
   Rep. Dan Schaefer (R-Colo.), chairman of the House energy and power
subcommittee, told Industrial Energy Bulletin Monday that the full
Commerce Committee will vote out restructuring legislation this year.
Anyone who thinks it will not do so is mistaken, he declared. He urged
input from all sectors of the industry.
   Schaefer reacted only briefly to ELCON's plan. ``I thought they brought
in some good points,'' he said, although he took issue with ELCON's
proposed three-year transition to retail competition, which he called too
fast. ``Real comprehensive legislation--you have to give it time,'' he
said. ``I'm not sure three years is the answer.'' He suggested a phased-in
approach so as not to ``upset things.''
   When ELCON released its blueprint in September, it purposely glossed
over the stranded-cost issue. Shortly thereafter, Schaefer and William
Massey of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission challenged the group to
come forward with specific proposals addressing stranded-cost recovery.
   ELCON's answer to those challenges is a five-step process featuring a
formula for dividing up responsibility for unmitigable stranded investment.
The formula assigns a ``responsibility factor'' to utilities, to be
determined by state regulators according to how efficiently a utility
responded to regulatory mandates and whether the company opposed the
mandates in the first place.
   A utility would be required to absorb at least 50% of its unmitigable
stranded costs, but in practice it probably would have to bear a greater
share. In a nutshell, the formula starts by assigning stranded costs
equally between ratepayers and shareholders, with the responsibility factor
deciding how much of the ratepayers' 50% share the utility would be
required to absorb in addition to its 50% share.
   But the formula only would be applied after state regulators conduct
what ELCON is billing as ``the last great rate case'' to determine what
sunk costs are not mitigable. In the alternative, the utility could opt to
sell its generation assets as a means of determining stranded costs.
   Stranded-cost recovery mechanisms would be subject to negotiation with
individual customers and classes of customers. Regulators would decide
recovery in the absence of a negotiated settlement. The utility would have
no more than five years to recover its stranded costs.
   ELCON executive director John Anderson called the road map's stranded
cost provisions a ``statesmanlike'' effort to end the impasse between ELCON
and EEI over stranded-cost recovery. Historically, ELCON has rejected any
level of stranded-cost recovery in response to EEI's position that
utilities are entitled to 100% recovery. With its proposal on the table,
the issue of stranded-cost recovery is now open to negotiation, Anderson
suggested.
   But EEI president Thomas Kuhn called ELCON's proposal on stranded costs
a nonstarter.
   ``I don't see that there's anything new in the ELCON proposal,'' Kuhn
said in an appearance before the Washington International Energy Group.
``We don't see a bargaining chip here at all.''
   Kuhn cited ``leading economists,'' FERC and most states as endorsing
EEI's position that utilities are entitled to 100% recovery. He predicted
that states will reject ELCON's complicated proposal.
   ELCON's road map proposes a three-year transition featuring a ``customer
election period'' based on the telephone industry experience. No later than
the mid-point of the three-year transition period, state regulators would
feature a ``Day One'' designating the beginning of the customer election
period. As of that date, every customer would have the right to choose an
electric service provider. Customers would be notified at least six months
prior to Day One of their right to switch from their utility provider.
   At the end of the transition, all generation assets will have been
removed from rate base. The generation company may continue to sell the
asset's power to its affiliated--or previously affiliated--distribution
company beyond the transition period under terms of a transition contract
approved by the state.
   Transition contracts also would provide for ancillary and backup
services to qualifying facilities under the Public Utility Regulatory
Policies Act. The utility PURPA Reform group criticized this aspect of the
proposal as setting the stage for ``the last great PURPA land rush.'' The
group called it inconsistent to deny utilities stranded costs while
committing them indefinitely to the purchase of QF power.
   But ELCON's Anderson rejected utility complaints about uneconomic QF
contracts as ``a thing of the past.'' No utility is entering into high-cost
contracts with PURPA facilities today, he said. The importance of PURPA's
Section 210 is not its mandatory purchase provision, but the section's
requirements that utilities provide backup and ancillary services to QFs.
   As a check against market power, ELCON's road map calls for operational
unbundling of vertically integrated utilities using the Dept. of Justice's
methodology. While free market entry is an important check, it is not
sufficient in and of itself, the group said. Transmission assets would be
turned over to an independent system operator and controls would be placed
on interaffiliate pricing of transmission services and interaffiliate
distribution transactions.
   EEI's Kuhn dismissed as ``specious'' ELCON's concerns about utility
market power and industry concentration. The electric utility industry is a
great deal less concentrated than the telephone industry or most ELCON
members, Kuhn asserted.
   ELCON further proposed that, during the first two years of the
transition, owners of FERC-regulated transmission facilities would be
required to file regional transmission group proposals. Siting of new
interstate transmission systems would become FERC's responsibility. ELCON
also proposed establishment of unregulated Private Delivery Systems, or
PDSs, such as a line linking two industrial facilities.
   If a new transmission line is built privately and without the exercise
of eminent domain, then the line would be unregulated. Owners of existing
transmission systems could petition FERC for a license to opt out from rate
regulation if the owner can show it does not exercise market power and the
line was not sited through the power of eminent domain. The unregulated
privately owned transmission facilities would provide competitive pressures
on monopoly transmission providers, ELCON suggested.
   Independent System Operator franchises would be granted for finite
periods in order to allow others the opportunity to competitively bid for
the right to serve the franchise, ELCON proposed.
   Local distribution services would be unbundled with traditional
distribution functions split between the ``wires'' business and the
electric services merchant business under the proposal.
   ELCON also proposes establishment of joint federal-state boards to make
recommendations for state legislative actions to ensure universal service.
   The road map places much of the responsibility for the outcome of the
transition with state regulators, said ELCON's Anderson. The proposal is
intended to put to rest concerns of state regulators that ELCON advocates
``federalizing the system,'' he said: ``The states are going to have a
whole lot to do'' if the road map is implemented.

NEES REACHES DEAL WITH N.H. PUC STAFF FOR WHEELING PILOT THAT WILL BEGIN IN
MAY

   New England Electric System has reached an agreement with the New
Hampshire Public Utilities Commission staff on conditions for its local
affiliate, Granite State Electric, to carry out a retail wheeling pilot
program starting in May 1996.
   NEES announced the breakthrough Jan. 5 during a briefing to the
commission on collaborative talks between the staff and all utilities in
the state on the two-year pilot, which had been proposed in October to
cover 3% of utility load.
   No other utility announced on Jan. 5 that it had come to terms with the
staff and, therefore, the commission permitted an extra week until Jan. 12
for negotiations.
   In the NEES agreement with the staff, only general outlines were made
public. But sources familiar with the deal said the two sides split the
difference on the key stranded cost issue and that Granite State would be
allowed to recoup 75% of its losses caused by the pilot.
   Granite State will use an access charge to recover the stranded cost and
said the level would be low enough to give customers a ``meaningful'' level
of savings from the pilot. Currently, Granite State's average prices are
10.3 cents/kWh for residential and 7.9 cents/kWh for industrial users.
   In its September draft guidelines, the PUC had proposed 50% recovery of
losses, and NEES and the other utilities had replied by demanding full 100%
recovery before they would cooperate on the plan.
   Once the NEES deal with the staff is formally proposed to the PUC, it is
sure to draw fire from both industrial groups that support the original 50%
level and probably Public Service of New Hampshire, which has held out for
100% recovery.
   In a statement, NEES said the agreement was meant to allow the retail
wheeling pilot proceed as scheduled in May for Granite State customers even
if it is delayed for other utilities in the state. NEES also said that once
the plan was approved by the PUC, it would communicate with its customers
about how they could participate in the pilot.
   Participants would receive unbundled rates for transmission and
distribution and could chose their power supplier. They also would continue
to receive energy conservation programs from the distributor.
   In its October proposal, the PUC allotted 3.75 MW of Granite State's
load to the statewide pilot, which would cover a total of 60 MW. PSNH is by
far the largest participant with 44 MW, although this level may be reduced
to 33 MW.
   While reaching a final deal with PSNH is clearly the top priority of the
PUC, the agreement with NEES appears to be a breakthrough that could make
it harder for PSNH to maintain a hard line in future talks.

MOJAVE PIPELINE PLANS NEW OPEN SEASON IN JAN. OR FEB. TO DECIDE FATE OF
PROJECT

   Mojave Pipeline will hold a new ``open season'' auction in January or
February, and the outcome could decide the fate of the controversial
California natural gas pipeline project.
   Mojave, the Bakersfield, Calif., subsidiary of El Paso Natural Gas, has
been trying since 1992 to break into the California market, providing the
only major transportation alternative to Pacific Gas & Electric for big
users. The line would extend from the Arizona border to Sacramento, with
laterals running to the industrial area around San Francisco Bay. With its
firm rate of 47 cents/decatherm, the line drew a number of large
industrials eager to escape PG&E's intrastate transport rates, which can
exceed $1/dt.
   But the project got bogged down by regulatory demands at both the state
and federal levels (IEB, 8 Sept, 2). Meanwhile, PG&E began discounting its
rates to large users and a number of industrials took those offers, rather
than wait out the regulatory uncertainty.
   In the most recent development, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
ordered Mojave to hold an open season for shippers on Mojave's existing
line--which only extends as far as Bakersfield--to release capacity to
prospective northward expansion customers.
   Although this does not directly affect the expansion itself, Mojave
decided to throw open the whole project to auction in order to gauge the
remaining market interest, according to president Michael Holland.
   The existing contracts call for a firm rate of 47 cents/dt, escalating
at 1% annually, for 15 years. That, however, was based on a project of 475
million cubic feet per day (mmcf/d). ``If the market supports a smaller
project, rates may hve to go higher,'' Holland said, and he added that
Mojave will need at least 325 mmcf/d to proceed at all.
   On a positive note, the recent FERC order favored Mojave on a nagging
pricing issue that threatened to repel more customers (Docket No.
CP93-258-007).
   Previously, the commission ruled that Mojave would have to file new rate
cases each year, instead of fixing 15-year contracts. But the company
complained that neither Mojave nor its customers could abide that kind of
uncertainty and the condition was overturned on rehearing.

N.J. MOVES PSE&G LGAC TO MONTH BASIS, TO LET BIG USERS PLAY MARKET BETTER

   The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities has approved a proposal by
Public Service Electric & Gas to switch gas price calculations from a
yearly to a monthly basis.
   This will affect the levelized gas adjustment clause (LGAC), which lets
utilities recover their actual fuel costs. Traditionally, utilities have
updated the LGAC on an annual basis, but the market is now so vibrant, that
customers need more frequent price signals, according to the BPU.
   ``The monthly pricing scheme reflects the current market price and will
allow customers to make more informed decisions concerning their energy
needs,'' said BPU president Herbert Tate.
   With the LGAC changing on a monthly basis, large users will be able to
decide whether to buy from the utility, or from outside suppliers.
   Very large industrials mostly buy exclusively from suppliers or
marketers, using the local utility only for transportation. However,
smaller industrials may still take gas supplies from their local
utilities.
   PSE&G, which proposed the alteration, is indifferent to the price
changes, since utilities only pass along fuel costs on a dollar-for-dollar
basis, and earn no profit.

IN WHAT MAY BE PG&E'S LAST GENERAL RATE CASE, INDUSTRIALS WIN 8% ELECTRIC
CUTS

   Pacific Gas & Electric's large industrial customers will enjoy an 8%
reduction in electric rates this year while the utility also will reduce
its gas rates and pipeline tariffs for core and noncore customers and
cogenerators.
   The California Public Utilities Commission December 20 ordered PG&E to
reduce its 1996 electric rates by $434-million, or an average 5.5%, and gas
rates by $262-million, or an average 11.77%, effective January 1. The
combined rate cuts incorporated PG&E's general rate case with several other
electric and gas revenue and pipeline expansion proceedings.
   The rate cuts will be shared by all customer classes, with all classes
gaining at least 50% of the average reduction and large customers limited
to 150% of the average reduction. The PUC reduced PG&E's electric rates for
commercial and small industrial customers 7%, agricultural rates 2.6%, and
residential rates 2.9%.
   ``This is great news for PG&E customers,'' said PUC Commissioner Jessie
Knight, Jr. ``As industrial customers see lower electric costs the economy
benefits,'' as higher earnings stimulate job growth, he said
   This is expected to be PG&E's last three-year general rate case since
the PUC plans to adopt performance-based ratemaking in implementing its
electric restructuring order providing incentives for utilities to operate
more efficiently and rewarding productivity.
   The PUC has adopted a PBR mechanism for San Diego Gas & Electric and is
currently considering a PBR proposal by Southern California Edison.
Moreover, the PUC has already severed fuel costs, Diablo Canyon ratemaking,
and rate of return issues from PG&E's general rate case and reviews them in
separate proceedings.
   The PUC noted that the decision represented its first step toward
removing large commercial customers from averaging of core residential and
nonresidential gas rates and tariffs. The PUC accordingly approved a slight
shift in PG&E's gas revenue requirement from noncore to core customers.
   The commission adopted PG&E's proposal to reinstate a seasonal rate
differential for noncore industrial and cogeneration gas customers. At the
same time, the PUC rejected the Sacramento Municipal Utility District's
proposal for an unbundled backbone transmission rate, noting that PG&E
plans to unbundle tranmission and storage services.
   The PUC adopted the recommendations of Administrative Law Judge Kim
Malcolm, trimming PG&E's 1996 rates more than the utility had requested.
PG&E had proposed reducing its 1996 electric rates by $128.7-million and
its gas rates by $203.6-million.
   The utility had initially sought to reduce its electric rates by
$200.8-million and its gas rates by $119.1-million, but modified its
requests several times. PG&E has proposed rate cuts to reduce its electric
rates to 10 cents/kWh by December 1999 from its current rates of 10.5
cents/kWh.
   ``It is unusual for a utility to request substantial rate reductions in
its general rate case but a welcome one,'' PUC President Daniel Fessler
said. ``This represents significant progress (in reducting electric rates),
but it is a beginning.''
   PG&E maintained that its final revenue request was a ``bare bones''
proposal in line with its ongoing corporate-wide programs to reduce
operating costs and rates. However, ALJ Malcolm found that PG&E's estimates
of doing business in 1996 and $4.6-billion revenue requirement request were
too high. She stressed that it would be unfair for ratepayers to help
finance the utility's transition to a competitive electric industry.
   Malcolm determined that PG&E had overestimated its future costs for
nuclear decommissioning, employee compensation and pension fund, and
pipeline replacement. She also found that PG&E's timing of recovery for
fossil and geothermal decommissioning costs was unreasonable.
   The ALJ also denied PG&E's request for nearly $30-million in ratepayer
subsidies for marketing programs designed to retain customers, saying that
those costs should be paid by shareholders or customers that benefit
directly from such programs.

SOUTH CAROLINA INDUSTRIALS TO CHALLENGE BROAD RATE HIKES APPROVED FOR
SCE&G

   An industrial group in South Carolina will challenge the Public Service
Commission's late-December decision to approve virtually all of the general
rate increase requested by South Carolina Electric & Gas (Docket No.
95-1000-E).
   Arthur Fusco, a Columbia, S.C., attorney who represents the South
Carolina Energy Users Committee, said the group will urge the PSC to
reconsider several key aspects of its ruling, which granted SCE&G a 7.34%,
$67.5-million general rate increase to be implemented in two phases--a
$59.5-million hike as soon as its new, 385-MW baseload plant in Cope, S.C.,
begins commercial operation later this month, and an $8-million increase
next Jan. 1.
   The investor-owned utility had requested a two-step increase totaling
$76.7-million, or 8.35%, primarily to recoup the $436-million cost of the
Cope plant.
   The commission also said it will allow SCE&G to earn a 12% rate of
return on common equity, which is lower than the 12.25% rate the utility
had requested, but higher than both the 11% it had been permitted to earn
and the 11.25% to 11.75% range proposed by most of those who testified to
the PSC.
   Fusco took issue with the 12% rate of return, noting that even a
quarter-percent increase in that rate results in ``significantly higher''
rates for industrials and others. He also criticized the PSC's decision to
support SCE&G's proposals to establish a $50-million, customer-funded storm
damage reserve fund, and to transfer nearly $256.7-million in depreciation
reserves from the utility's transmission and distribution assets to its
nuclear generation assets.
   The depreciation-reserve shift, Fusco said, will artificially reduce
SCE&G's nuclear generation costs, but increase the utility's T&D costs and,
presumably, its transmission-access and wheeling costs. That, he continued,
would give SCE&G an unfair competitive advantage over other generators, and
will force anyone who seeks access to the utility's T&D system to pay
more.
   Belton Ziegler, SCE&G's general counsel, said the transfer is a
necessary preemptive step to ensure that any industrials that leave the
utility for other suppliers help pay for assets SCE&G had developed to
serve them.
   Without the shift, he said, residential and small-commercial customers
would likely end up paying for ``100%'' of the utility's stranded
investment, ``and we don't think that would be fair.''
   Ziegler continued, ``If you look at the natural gas industry, the
benefits of deregulation went--for the most part--to large customers who
could move off the system'' and avoid, as much as possible, the
responsibility for paying off the investments their old gas companies had
made to serve them.
   ``We are telling industrials that if they leave as generation customers
they still will have to pay [for the nuclear assets SCE&G developed for
them] as transmission and distribution customers.''
   Ziegler also dismissed assertions that the storm fund is unfair. He said
that after Hurricane Hugo battered SCE&G's service territory in September
1989, the utility looked into ways it could prepare for the next big
storm.
   ``It became clear that commercial insurance would be prohibitively
expensive, and that would make more sense to set up a fund'' like the one
the utility proposed and the PSC just approved.
   Fusco said the industrial group is likely to support the South Carolina
Dept. of Consumer Affairs' newly announced plan to ask the PSC to
reconsider its ruling.
   Nancy Vaughn Coombs, DCA's deputy consumer advocate, told Industrial
Energy Bulletin said the DCA took issue with virtually all aspects of the
PSC's ruling, asserting that the rate increase is more than three times
larger than it should be, and that South Carolina law does not allow the
creation of a storm fund like the one the commission approved.
   But Coombs said her agency is most concerned about the
depreciation-reserve transfer, which she said would have the effect of
shifting SCE&G's costs away from its generation sector, which is likely to
face increasing competition as electric-industry deregulation takes hold,
to its transmission and distribution sector, which is likely to remain a
monopoly.
   As a result, she said, SCE&G will have ``a significantly increased
probability'' of recouping--through T&D rates--nuclear investment costs
that ``otherwise would have been subjected to an uncertain policy regarding
the recovery of costs of uneconomic generation capacity.''
   Coombs said that if the commission fails to reverse this and other key
elements of its ruling, her agency is likely to file a legal challenge in
state court.

CONSUMERS INKS LONG-TERM DISCOUNT DEALS WITH THREE MICH. INDUSTRIALS

   Three large industrial firms in Consumers Power's territory have struck
long-term power agreements with the utility in exchange for specified
discounts.
   On Dec. 7, the Michigan Public Service Commission granted ex parte
approval to Consumers' request to become the sole supplier of electricity
to Dow Corning and its affiliate Hemlock Semiconductor (Case U-10997).
   The PSC also granted ex parte approval to Consumers to provide power to
Bundy Tubing on a sole-supplier basis (Case U-10995). A contract between
the utility and Pharmacia & Upjohn is pending.
   Under the agreement between Consumers and Dow Corning, Consumers will be
sole supplier over an eight-year period. Although specific dollar figures
were not disclosed, Dow said it would save several million in energy costs
over the life of the agreement.
   The deal covers three key industrial facilities and is crafted to retain
an existing load and to meet new power requirements between now and 2003.
According to a Consumers spokesman, the utility currently supplies a total
of 50 MW to Dow's corporate center, Hemlock Semiconductor and Dow's Midland
site, which contains an operating 18-MW, wood-fired cogeneration plant.
   Over the eight years of the agreement, this 50 MW gradually be increased
to 110 MW, as the cogeneration unit is shut down next year and Hemlock
Semiconductor expands its facility, the spokesman said.
   A separate agreement calls for the Midland Cogeneration Venture, a
Consumers Power affiliate, to supply approximately one billion lbs. of
steam annually to Dow Corning.
   The special contract with Bundy Tubing has an initial term of five
years, after which time it is subject to automatic renewal for successive
one-year periods. However, after the initial term either party may cancel
the contract by providing the other with timely written notice.
   The contract requires Bundy Tubing to purchase all of its electricity
from Consumers except for back-up generation. Rates and terms of the
purchase are governed by Consumers' Rate D less 15%. Rate D has a charge of
$100/customer/month and an on-peak billing demand charge of $7.85/kW. In
addition, there is a maximum demand charge of $1.85/kW for primary service,
$0.97/kW for subtransmission service and $0.52/kW for transmission
service.
   The special contract with Bundy contains provisions to encourage the
industrial to implement demand and energy savings programs. Consumers has
agreed to reimburse Bundy for the cost of such programs up to $20,000,
provided the programs are completed to Consumers' satisfaction before Jan.
1, 1996, are designed to improve the industrial firm's operations in
Coldwater, Mich., and are performed in accordance with applicable laws and
regulations.
   On Dec. 4, Consumers signed a contract with Pharmacia & Upjohn, its
second largest industrial customer, to become the sole supplier of 75 MW at
discounted rates for 10 years. The contract applies to the industrial
firm's research facility in Kalamazoo, Mich., and its manufacturing plant
in Portage, Mich.

PUC CLOSES PECO INTERRUPTIBLE RIDER; INDUSTRIALS SAY GROWTH WILL SUFFER

   The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission ruled that PECO Energy may
close its interruptible rate program to new load (Docket No. R-943281). The
move was opposed by the Philadelphia Area Industrial Energy Users Group
(PAIEUG) and Scott Paper Co., who said interruptible rates help attract new
load, and that freezing the program will hurt economic development (Docket
Nos. R-943281C002 and R-943281C0003).
   The Large Interruptible Rate Option (LILR) provides a discount rate of
approximately 57%, reducing charges from PECO from 7.493 cents/kWh to 3.217
cents/kWh. Although the PUC approved an alternative rate (IR-1), this will
provide a discount of only 5%, to new interruptible customers.
   When PECO proposed freezing LILR, it asked to limit interruptible rates
to customers who were under contract by Oct 1, 1995 (IEB, 25 Aug '95, 7).
It argued that interruptible rates were meant as a load management tool.
However, the utility now has up to 1,000 MW of excess capacity, and the
value of interruptible load has diminished. Since 1984, it has only
interrupted the LILR customers 12 times, PECO pointed out.
   However, industrials responded that the interruptible program is
important for economic development, and was never meant primarily as a load
management tool. Closing out this program will deter firms from starting
new plants in PECO territory or expanding existing plants, they said. In
addition, industrials fear that PECO will use the freeze as the first step
toward phasing-out existing interruptible rates altogether--basing this
prospect on statements by the company. PAIEUG noted that some of its
members have invested millions of dollars to expand in PECO territory, with
the expectation of interruptible service.
   In its decision, the PUC pointed out that PECO has other economic
development tariffs, such as flexible rate options, and that ``PECO is
well-equipped, without the LILR, to attract new load to the territory.'' It
added that electric rates are rarely the sole decisive factor in a
company's location decision and said that LILR has only been a significant
factor in only one firm's decision to move into the area--Lukens Steel.
Taxes, transportation and telecommunications are usually more important
factors, according to the PUC.
   It added that ``Continued availability of [LILR] would...produce a
reduction in PECO's revenues, which would ultimately cause the rates of
other customer classes to increase, which would not help to preserve
existing employment and investment.'' Because the economic development
argument is ``a bald assertion'' by PAIEUG, ``there are no direct benefits
to balance the cost of providing a subsidy of over 3.5 cents/kWh to LILR
customers,'' the PUC said.
   The commission also rejected PAIEUG's assertion that interruptible
customers should not incur generation-related capital costs since the
utility does not have to plan to meet their needs--it can simply interrupt
them any time it needs the capacity. The PUC noted that these customers are
only curtailed at times of peak demand, so that interruptible load only
displaces relatively low capital-cost peaking capacity, and cannot
substitute for baseload or intermediate capacity.

N.C. MUNICIPAL SAYS COINCIDENT-PEAK RATES ATTRACT, RETAIN INDUSTRIALS

   Coincident-peak-based rates that all larger industrial customers of
Greenville, N.C.'s municipal utility must pay are not only enabling
existing industrials to lower their electric bills, they are also helping
the muni lure new industrial firms to the city.
   So says John D. Chaffee, executive director of the Pitt County
Development Commission, adding that industrials that take full advantage of
what the CP rates can offer generally pay no more--and sometimes less--than
they would for electricity from investor-owned utilities and electric
cooperatives that serve areas around Greenville.
   The Greenville Utilities Commission (GUC), as the muni is known,
purchases all its wholesale power from the North Carolina Eastern Municipal
Power Agency, which in turn buys most of its power from Carolina Power &
Light. Because a significant portion of NCEMPA's and the muni's wholesale
power costs is based on their demand during CP&L's highest systemwide
demand hour each month, the muni agency and Greenville have been working
hard to minimize their monthly peaks through, among other things,
aggressive residential load control programs, and programs to help
industrials install peak-shaving generation (IEB, 29 Dec `95, 4).
   GUC general manager Roger Jones said the Greenville muni also in
mid-1994 replaced its traditional industrial rate schedule with a new menu
of CP-only rates that all customers with a demand of 750 kW or more must
choose from.
   They include an ``A'' rate for 750 kW-plus customers whose energy use
must be relatively constant, a ``B'' rate for 750 kW-plus industrials with
more flexibility, and a ``C'' rate for 8 MW-plus customers that are
willing--and able--to make significant reductions in their energy use
during coincident-peak periods.
   Under each rate, the customer pays a basic monthly charge of $440, plus
a relatively high per-kW rate for its demand during the 60 minutes each
month when CP&L--the muni's ultimate power supplier--experiences its
highest systemwide demand. The customer also pays a much smaller per-kW
charge for difference between that coincident-peak level and its highest
demand for all that month, plus energy charges.
   For instance, under the ``C'' rate, a 8-MW customer that reduces its
coincident-peak demand to 2 MW pays the $440 basic charge, plus demand
charges of $21.34/kW on the 2-MW coincident-peak demand and $2.86/kW on the
6 MW above that level. The customer also pays an energy charge of 3.323
cents/kWh.
   ``B'' rate customers, in turn, pay demand charges of $20.16 per
coincident-peak-hour kW and $4.25/kW of demand above that level, and energy
charges of 3.583 cent/kWh for the first 250 MWH and 3.278 cents/kWh for
additional energy.
   ``A'' rate customers, finally, pay a CP-hour demand charge of $18.36/kW,
$7.77/kW for excess demand, and the same energy charges as ``B'' rate
customers.
   [The GUC typically notifies its industrial customers by automated signal
when it expects a potential coincident-peak period to be approaching; at
that point, the rate agreement says, the customer ``may utilize any means
deemed suitable to reduce its coincident peak demand,'' including, for
instance, temporary production cuts and/or the use of muni-approved
peak-shaving generators.]
   Jones said that the muni's 750-kW-plus customers, who also include some
large commercial and institutional accounts, together comprise about
one-quarter of Greenville's total energy use, and that the CP rates have
encouraged them to reduce their peak-period demand by 15 to 20% from what
it typically would have been without the coincident-peak rates.
   The magnitude of reductions in coincident-peak demand varies widely from
customer to customer, the muni manager said. Some are able only to trim
their demand slightly, while others have been ``very aggressive'' and have
slashed peak-period demand by more than 50%. For example, a large Proctor &
Gamble manufacturing plant in Greenville that typically demands about 8 MW
reduces its demand to between 1 and 1.5 MW during coincident peaks, Jones
noted, saving both P&G and the muni thousands of dollars in monthly power
costs.
   Chaffee said P&G ``basically shuts down production [during forecasted CP
hours] to achieve the maximum possible savings.'' To make the best use of
its down time, he noted, the manufacturer performs required maintenance on
its production and other equipment.
   The development commission head said his panel and GUC work closely with
potential industrial recruits to explain the CP rates and to demonstrate
precisely how the industrial could make the fullest use of the rate to its
advantage.
   Chaffee gave as an example the new automobile parts plant that Japan's
ASMO Co. Ltd. in 1994 developed--and in 1995 expanded--in Greenville. The
combined $50-million facility demands about 2.5 MW.
   ``An important issue for ASMO in deciding where to site the [initial]
plant was power costs,'' he said. ``We were able to demonstrate that by
utilizing Greenville's CP rate and installing [a 1-MW peak-shaving
generator to further reduce CP demand] that they would be paying rates
competitive with'' industrial rates offered by Duke Power and other
low-cost, investor-owned utilities in the Southeast.
   Chaffee added, finally, that in his view the CP has been a significant
factor in enabling Greenville to draw increasing numbers of new industries.
He noted that while industrial firms announced $20-million in new
investments in the city in 1992 and $33-million the year after that,
industrial investment jumped to $43-million in 1994 and $55-million in
1995--the first two years the CP rates were mandated.

MONSANTO PHOSPHORUS UNIT INKS LONG-TERM DEAL WITH UTAH P&L

   Monsanto Co. and Utah Power & Light have signed a new power supply
agreement extending to 2001 service that was scheduled to expire in
mid-1997 for Monsanto's elemental phosphorus manufacturing plant at Soda
Springs.
   Approved by the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, the new agreement
includes payment of $30-million to the utility for early termination of the
existing contract, a $66,600 monthly minimum charge and 1.85 cents/kWh for
all energy delivered. (Order No. 26282).
   The new contract allows for delivery of about 1.66 billion kWh annually.
UP&L will supply Monsanto with 9 MW of firm power and up to 206 MW of
interruptible power. UP&L may interrupt or curtail service to Monsanto, its
largest Idaho customer, at any time to maintain its system integrity.
   ``The company's new agreement with Monsanto,'' the commission said,
``reflects changes required by manufacturing and supply options available
to Monsanto, and market and regulatory changes within an increasingly more
competitive electric industry.''
   Monsanto has alternatives to continuing its current levels of electric
use such as acquiring power through the Soda Springs municipal electric
system or changing to a much less energy-intensive, purified wet-acid
chemical process of producing phosphorus.
   The commission said, ``Our acceptance and approval of the proposed new
agreement should in no way be interpreted as preauthorization of retail
wheeling, accounting, ratemaking treatment or any rates other than those
specifically identified in the new agreement.''

NIPSCO INDUSTRIALS TO SEE $1.5-MILLION REFUND IN DISPUTED INSURANCE CLAIM

   Industrial customers of Northern Indiana Public Service are expected to
receive at least a $1.5-million refund from a disputed insurance settlement
stemming from the July 2, 1991, collapse of a water pipe at NIPSCO's 480-MW
Bailly coal plant on Lake Michigan.
   Bailly was knocked out of commercial operation for nearly five months
following the collapse of its main circulating water pipes leading into
Lake Michigan. The 15-foot-diameter pipes gave way while Pure Air Inc.
worked nearby to construct a $110-million scrubber at Bailly.
   During the outage, NIPSCO was forced to purchase surplus power from
other utilities at prices higher than what Bailly's industrial customers
had been paying. NIPSCO eventually recovered $9.65-million from its
insurance carrier, but flowed back only $2.75-million to compensate
ratepayers for fuel increases in excess of $6-million as a result of the
accident.
   According to industrial attorney Jack Wickes, of the Indianapolis law
firm Lewis & Kappes, ratepayers paid an additional $6.1-million in fuel
costs during Bailly's outage. Wickes told the Indiana Utility Regulatory
Commission in a hearing late last year that ratepayers should be ``made
whole'' for their higher costs, meaning they should get an additional
$3-million (Cause No. 387-06-FAC 18-S1) (IEB, 16 Dec '94, 10).
   In a 3-2 vote Dec. 19, the commission ordered NIPSCO to refund an
additional $3.35-million. The IURC based its refund amount on the actual
expenses and required the insurance proceeds to be applied first to the
increased fuel charges, which are covered by the insurance policy.
   Wickes told Industrial Energy Bulletin the order ``makes sense...
[NIPSCO] carried insurance for an eventuality that occurred and NIPSCO
wanted some of the money.'' Of the $3.35-million refund, industrials are
expected to receive at least $1.5- million because they represent ``45% to
50% of the consumption'' at the Bailly plant. The money will be refunded as
a credit on industrials' fuel-adjustment charge.
   Two commissioners--David Ziegner and Richard Klein--dissented from the
order. They agreed with the majority that a further refund was due, but
said only about $2-million should be refunded.

PA. FIRMS STRESS CHOICE OF SUPPLIERS; SEE UTILITIES CONTROLLING POWER POOL

   Pennsylvania industrials told the Public Utilities Commission that
retail competition would provide the choice of suppliers that they enjoy in
all other purchasing decisions and while a wholesale pool would provide
some rate benefits, it would be dominated by the utilities, who would keep
prices artificially high.
   The Industrial Energy Consumers of Pennsylvania (IECPA) stressed the
choice issue during testimony in the PUC's Investigation into Electric
Power Competition (Docket No. I-00940032). In that case, industrials are
calling for a six-year transition to retail competition, beginning in 1997
with customers over 5 MW (IEB, 17 Nov '95, 1).
   During recent hearings, IECPA attorney David Kleppinger, of the
Harrisburg law firm McNees, Wallace & Nurick, told the commission that
retail competition is ``a matter of sound public policy. Customer choice
will empower Pennsylvania customers with the ultimate regulator of price,
namely the competitive marketplace.'' However, customers must have direct
access to utilities' transmission and distribution systems to exercise that
choice, he added. Further, utilities should be required to provide
ancillary services on an unbundled, embedded cost-of-service basis. These
would include scheduling, dispatch, balancing, load following, voltage
support, reactive power and loss compensation.
   The issue of choice arose again when PUC commissioner John Hanger
questioned IECPA's analysis of the proposed wholesale pool. Assuming
``perfect competition,'' the pool price would be 2.67 cents/kWh, IECPA
found, but industrial witness Randall Falkenberg added that utilities
``could bid the price up to anything they want really, but I think that
they would stop at a point just a little bit below what new generation
would be''--or 3.5 to 4 cents/kWh.
   ``What is so bad about a price per kilowatt hour...of 3.5 cents/kWh or 4
cents/kWh as compared to today's prices?'' asked commissioner Hanger. Even
with another 1.2 cents added on for retail distribution, Hanger continued,
``[A]s to the prices people are paying right now in Pennsylvania, is this a
disaster?''
   Falkenberg, with the Atlanta firm Kennedy & Associates, responded, ``The
problem is how you get there. You get to that price because that is the
price at which the market-dominant utilities--principally PECO or
PP&L--decide that they want to charge. That's the problem. It's not that it
falls out of the competitive market. It's that a few people at PECO can
decide that's what we want the price to be, and they can enforce that.'' He
added that the utilities could set the price ``at a level just enough below
that a new entrant could build a generating unit at'' in order to keep out
competition.
   In a pool, Falkenberg explained, there would be seven main utility
sellers and one buyer--the independent system operator (ISO). But with
retail competition, ``what you've got is hundreds of thousands of buyers,
each one playing off one seller against another.''
   The hearings also covered stranded investment. IECPA argued that these
costs should be shared, with ratepayer contributions limited to costs that
result directly from deregulation, and which cannot be mitigated by
utilities. Industrials would probably be willing to bear some cost of
mitigation strategies such as accelerated depreciation of plants and
buyouts of overpriced contracts from non-utility generators, according to
Falkenberg. Utilities might also mitigate stranded costs by selling assets
and downsizing, he added.
   The PUC expects to wrap up the case by April, when it will make
recommendations to the governor and legislature.

ASSEMBLY SPEAKER BACKS RETAIL ACCESS IN N.Y.; NO GUARANTEE ON STRANDED
COSTS

   Several New York legislators, including the speaker of the assembly,
have proposed an electric restructuring plan that would open up retail
competition by the year 2000, but the plan would not give utilities any
guarantee that they could recover all of their stranded investments--a
position that industrials have long taken.
   Democratic Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver announced the proposal last
week, along with Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman and Energy
Committee Chair Paul Tonko. An aide to Silver said that legislation is
being drafted and is expected to be introduced by the middle of January.
Sponsors would then be sought for a senate version of the bill.
   The ``Competition Plus'' plan would immediately freeze electric rates,
and would phase-in competition over the next seven years. The first phase
of the transition would begin in September 1997, when all utilities would
be required to purchase power in a competitive wholesale market. In the
second phase, beginning in September 2000, all customers would be allowed
to choose their power suppliers, and utilities would be required to provide
transmission and distribution service. In September 2002, utilities would
be required to divest their generating resources.
   A key aspect of the plan is that it would provide ``no guarantee that
utilities will recover all previously incurred costs.'' The stranded
investment issue is one of the biggest disputes in the restructuring
debate. Utilities demand full recovery of stranded costs, saying they have
been required to build enough capacity to meet load forecasts, and that
regulators approved the expensive projects, such as nuclear plants, that
could become financial millstones in the competitive market.
   Industrials, however, argue that many high costs result from
mismanagement and that utility shareholders should absorb some of the
burden. They say utilities should only be allowed to collect costs that
result directly from deregulation and which cannot be mitigated (IEB, 3 Nov
`95, 10).
   The legislators' initiative comes as the Public Service Commission moves
toward resolution of the ``Competitive Opportunities'' proceeding (Case No.
94-E-0952). It challenges the recent ruling in that case by Administrative
Law Judge Judith Lee, who recommended only wholesale competition until some
unspecified date when retail competition is proven not to harm small
ratepayers and reliability. Industrials bitterly condemned that decision,
saying it preserves the status quo and lets utilities control the direction
of change (IEB, 29 Dec `95, 4).
   In announcing the proposal, Assemblyman Tonko stated, ``As the electric
industry moves to a competitive environment, it is clear that the
legislature has a role in the process. Lessons learned from around the
country--specifically in California and the New England states--indicate
that a purely administrative solution to this complex challenge will not
achieve the desired goal of reducing energy prices.''

INDUSTRIAL DSM SEEN GETTING CUSTOMIZED, INCLUDING HELP ON PRODUCTION,
POLLUTION

   Utilities must transform their industrial demand-side management
programs to meet the demands of the competitive market, according to a new
report. This means shifting from a ``resource procurement'' focus to a
customer service approach, says IRT Environment Inc., a Basalt, Colo.,
information and consulting firm.
   IRT states that ``Utilities must provide enhanced, rather than reduced,
services to their industrial customers to satisfy them as customers in a
direct-access environment.'' It notes that industrials are utilities
``least captive'' customers, with options for fuel switching, cogeneration,
and shifting loads to other regions. Therefore, utilities must heed their
complaints about rate-subsidized DSM, the report says. Most big
manufacturers have been pursuing conservation for years, so they see
rate-based DSM as a form of socialism to subsidize others--including
competing industrial firms that have not taken the same initiative.
Utilities should also realize that prescriptive rebates are not appropriate
for industrial users, the report adds. Up to now, utilities have generally
provided industrials very basic services, such as audits and rebates for
motors and lighting. But process work has not been widespread, partly
because processes vary greatly from industry to industry and from firm to
firm. This demands customized approaches, which should include not just
energy efficiency, but help with power quality, productivity improvements
and environmental compliance.
   Some industrials interviewed for the report doubted that utilities can
provide effective energy services, since they have no entrepreneurial
skills. They think utilities can best promote efficiency through
information, rate design and financing. However, some utilities are
contracting with or even acquiring existing energy service companies.
Others may use consultants with expertise in particular industries to help
their customers.
   The report, ``Industrial Efficiency Programs: Building Strategic
Partnerships,'' is available for $100 from The Results Center, IRT
Environment Inc., P.O. Box 2239, Basalt, Colo. 81621; (970) 927-3155.

INDIANA QUARRY'S REQUEST FOR SERVICE FROM PSI ENERGY OVER CO-OP IS
APPROVED

   Citing reliability concerns, an Indiana industrial has prevailed in its
request to the state Utility Regulatory Commission to be served by PSI
Energy, the state's largest electric company, instead of a small rural
electric cooperative (Cause No. 40008).
   In a mid-December ruling the URC authorized PSI to serve a 1.1-MW load
at U.S. Aggregates' Delphi Quarry, a limestone and gravel quarry near
Delphi, Ind., over the objections of Carroll County Rural Electric
Membership Corp.
   Kenneth Robinson, vice president of operations for U.S. Aggregates, said
his company bought the quarry in 1993 and has been expanding it. The
current site consists of a ``primary'' plant located in Carroll County's
service territory and a ``secondary'' plant located in PSI's territory.
   U.S. Aggregates based its preference for PSI on a number of factors: The
present service from PSI has been good; PSI's energy-only rates with no
demand charge, allowing U.S. Aggregates to forecast its usage and utility
costs accurately; PSI offers a larger industrial base and more stable rates
in the future; U.S. Aggregate's concern with possible brown-outs during the
summer, its peak season; and its belief that PSI's capacity and resources
ensure a continuity of service, even during peak demand periods.
   Carroll County manager Ron Kennedy told the URC that even though his
co-op only has five industrial customers, those customers comprise 35% of
its total load. One customer, Indiana Packers, has a peak demand of 5 MW.
   Also, Carroll County, apparently to quell concerns over the possibility
of outages, noted that its office is located only one-half mile from the
Delphi Quarry. The commission issued its ruling somewhat grudgingly, saying
it discourages the practice of ``rate shopping'' by electric utility
customers. The URC said it has been ``reluctant to base determinations of
public convenience and necessity matters relative to service boundary
disputes on rate differentials.''
   To do so, ``could encourage `rate shopping' at the expense of prudent
planning and good utility practice.'' In this case, however, the URC agreed
with U.S. Aggregates that PSI ``can better provide adequate and reliable
service.'' The investor-owned utility, a subsidiary of CINergy Corp., has a
``marginal benefit'' with regard to reliability over the co-op.
   A URC spokeswoman stressed that the agency's comments about ``rate
shopping'' do not mean the commission is necessarily opposed to retail
wheeling. ``We have to go by our interpretation of the existing law,'' she
said. ``Until and unless we have a different direction from the
Legislature, we have to follow existing laws.''

WEPCO IN DISPUTE WITH UPPER PENINSULA POWER OVER SERVING MINE EXPANSION

   Wisconsin Electric Power and Upper Peninsula Power are currently in
settlement talks trying to resolve a dispute over a proposed retail
wheeling agreement that would have allowed WEPCO to supply electricity to
the White Pine mine in Michigan's Upper Peninsula--one of UPPCo's current
customers.
   White Pine is one of the facilities of Copper Range--a corporation
engaged in the mining, refining, and selling of copper in the UP. It
consists of an underground copper mine and related ore processing
facilities located in Carp Lake Township, Ontonagon County, Michigan.
   Until recently, the mine utilized two 20 MW coal-fired generating units
to supply most of its electric energy requirements while occasionally
purchasing small amounts of energy from UPPCo.
   In its application to the Michigan Public Service Commission for
approval of a special contract with the mine, WEPCO said that because of
increased competition, White Pine began exploring the possibility of
expanding its mining operations or, in the alternative, temporarily
shutting down the mine in order to install a new ``solution'' mining
project while pursuing the construction of a new smelter.
   Solution mining injects a slightly acidic liquid into the rock
formations and brings the copper up in liquid form, to be recovered later
as a precipitate.
   Whether White Pine expands operations or builds a new smelter, it has
concluded that the best way to reduce its operating costs, protect jobs,
and provide the greatest likelihood for expanded operations in the future
is to shut down its generating plant and purchase electricity from WEPCO,
the utility stated in its special contract application.
   If approved, WEPCO would supply curtailable electric service to White
Pine. However, WEPCO does not have transmission facilities to serve
increased loads so in order to service to the mine, the utility, on June 1,
entered into a joint use transmission agreement with UPPCo that would
obviate any necessity for WEPCO to build new facilities to serve the mine
until the new smelter is built.
   In its special contract application, WEPCO stated that it was seeking no
certificated authority to render retail service to any resident or business
in Carp Lake Township other than White Pine. The utility also told the PSC
that the proposed agreement was advantageous to the mine because WEPCO
might buy the mine's generating plant.
   UPPCo said it entered into the joint use transmission agreement with
WEPCO at a time when it was believed that UPPCo's transmission facilities
alone would, in the future, be unable to provide reliable service to While
Pine. UPPCo noted that if the mine had shut down its two generating units,
installed the new ``solution'' mining project, and constructed the new
smelter, demand might have increased to more than 100 MW. UPPCo does not
have transmission facilities in place that are capable of serving loads of
this magnitude and an investment would have been required to construct such
facilities. To make such an investment ``in a volatile industry would have
created a substantial risk for a small utility such as UPPCo,'' the company
told the PSC in its petition to intervene.
   When it learned that WEPCO was willing to assume the risk of building
new transmission facilities, UPPCo said it decided to cooperate with the
larger utility and entered into the joint use agreement.
   However, according to UPPCo, there has been a subsequent change in
circumstances that makes the joint use agreement no longer ``necessary or
appropriate'' for its purposes. Specifically, Copper Range shut down its
White Pine mining operations, including the 40 MW generating plant,
retaining only the experimental solution mining project and maintenance
operations.
   ``As a result, the resulting curtailed White Pine mine load can be
adequately served by UPPCo over its existing transmission facilities, and
the participation of Wisconsin Electric is no longer necessary or
desirable,'' UPPCo told the PSC in its intervention petition. Accordingly,
UPPCo asked the PSC not to approve WEPCO's special contract petition.
   In a similar argument before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
UPPCo declared that the changed circumstances led it to decide not to file
the joint use agreement with FERC and that WEPCO was not authorized to file
the agreement on UPPCo's behalf. Regulatory proceedings at both FERC and
the PSC are on hold, pending the outcome of settlement talks, sources
said.

MAINE PS WINS APPROVAL FOR DISCOUNTS FOR INDUSTRIALS CREATING NEW LOAD

   Maine Public Service has won approval from the Maine Public Utilities
Commission for a new targeted economic development rate that would give
temporary discounts for new and existing industrial customers creating new
load.
   Under a special rate proposal approved Dec. 1 (Doc. No. 95-802), new
customers with average demand of at least 50 kW who take full load from MPS
will get a credit on their monthly bills equal to 20% the first year of the
contract, 15% the second year, 10% the third year and 5% the fourth year.
   Also, existing customers adding at least 20 kW of new load and meet
other criteria will receive 20% credits for the new supplies in the first
and second contract years, 15% in the third year and 10% in the fourth
year.
   The PUC said it would cap the special credits at a cumulative amount of
20 MW of new supplies and that requests for the discounts for individual
customers would be considered in the order they were received.
   At the same time, the PUC approved a separate 10% permanent discount for
agricultural storage facilities, which will especially help the local
potato industry. In both cases, the PUC also ordered that any revenue
losses due to the discounts will be borne totally by MPS shareholders and
not ratepayers.
   Early in 1995, MPS asked the PUC for an 18.5% rate hike spread over five
years to meet revenue losses caused by the closing of a local air base and
loss of a major wholesale customer. In November, the PUC approved a
four-year, 12.8% hike but left open for a decision next year how the costs
will be allocated among customer classes. MPS has asked that the main
burden be placed on residential users, to bring industrial rates more in
line with cost-of-service levels.
   The new discounts will enable the company to partially offset the cost
of the rate hike for new and expanding businesses and aid industrial
recruiting while the allocation issue is being debated. They also may help
bring new industrial users to the former Loring Air Force Base and restore
some of the revenues lost due to the closure.
   In early January, MPS said it had signed its first economic development
contract under the new system with the Happy Farms cold storage facility in
Caribou, Me. It said the company had increased business activity and load
needs and qualified for the discounts starting at 20% and dropping to 10%
by the fourth year.

SIGECO CREDITS DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS FOR WINNING MAJOR NEW TOYOTA PLANT

   Toyota Motor Corp.'s decision to build a $700-million truck assembly
plant near Princeton, Ind., is expected to generate a 25-30 MW electric
load, at least initially, for Southern Indiana Gas & Electric, and if
history is any guide, the load is likely to increase dramatically over the
years.
   SIGECO credited its economic development efforts with contributing to
Toyota's choice of a 1,100-acre site in Gibson County for its new plant
instead of competing sites in Kentucky, Ohio and other parts of Indiana.
All of the site, located along U.S. 41 about 20 miles north of Evansville,
is within SIGECO's service territory. PSI Energy, another IOU, serves an
area just north of the plant site.
   In announcing their selection of the Princeton site, Toyota officials
said the plant would employ 1,300 people and begin producing pickup trucks
in 1998. SIGECO worked closely with the Princeton Chamber of Commerce,
which played a vital role in building a relationship with Toyota, as well
as regional economic development agencies and state government, including
the Indiana Department of Commerce.
   The utility will be building additional transmission facilities,
including a transmission line extension and a new substation, to serve
Toyota. Likewise, SIGECO also will be making similar enhancements to its
natural gas system.
   Although SIGECO would not disclose the plant's projected load, Toyota's
automotive assembly plant near Georgetown, Ky., about 200 miles away,
started out with an approximately 30 MW load in the mid-1980s. Since then,
Toyota has built a second plant at Georgetown, and the site's total load
has mushroomed to 112 MW.
   Kentucky Utilities, which serves the plant, said Toyota's electrical
usage has increased from 166,055,040 kilowatt hours in 1989 to 552,122,640
kilowatt hours in 1994.

WABASH VALLEY REORGANIZES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT RATES FOR INDUSTRIALS

   The Wabash Valley Power Assn. has restructured its economic development
rates, replacing its old catch-all EDR-2 rate with three rates designed to
appeal to a broader range of industrial and commercial customers.
   Wabash Valley's three new EDR tariffs were contained in a settlement
agreement recently approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission
(Cause No. 40298). ``In some ways, we're modeling what we're doing on what
PSI/CINergy is doing'' in the area of economic development, said a Wabash
Valley spokesman. PSI Energy is headquartered in Plainfield, Ind., just a
few miles from Wabash Valley's Indianapolis office.
   Under its EDR-2 rate, only new customers with a load in excess of 750 kW
could qualify for its provisions: a demand charge of $10.70/kW for
distribution and $9.70/kW for transmission and an energy charge of 18.81
mills. The discount rate expired after three years. Now, eligible new loads
or existing plant expansions can obtain the revised rates for five years.
   The new EDR-3 rate applies to loads from 300 kW to 749 kW, a load that a
machine shop or Laundromat might have. It carries a demand charge of
$10.72/kW for distribution and $972/kW for transmission and an energy
charge of 18.733 mills.
   The new EDR-4 rate applies to loads from 750 kW to 1.499 MW. It carries
a demand charge of $8.45/kW for distribution and $7.45/kW for transmission
and an energy charge of 17.571 mills. The final rate--EDR-5--applies to
loads in excess of 1.5 MW. This rate is negotiable on a case-by-case
basis.
   Wabash Valley, a generation and transmission cooperative that plans to
emerge in 1997 from more than a decade in Chapter 11 reorganization
proceedings, negotiated the terms of the new tariffs with the state Office
of the Utility Consumer Counselor. Wabash Valley and the OUCC said the new
EDRs are intended to encourage new and expanded industrial and commercial
loads to locate or remain in Indiana.
   ``Based upon this and the evidence presented, the proposed tariffs are
found by this commission to be in the public interest,'' ruled the IURC.
   The Wabash Valley spokesman said the new rates should help the co-op
compete for business against other utilities in a deregulated industry.
``We're stepping up to the plate, and we're going to become as much of a
player in this as anyone else.''

TROUBLED VERDIGRIS VALLEY CO-OP DENIES ALLEGATIONS IN CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT

   Verdigris Valley Electric Cooperative, its economic development
subsidiary and four current and former trustees have formally denied
allegations of gross negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and violation of
state and federal laws or regulations in connection with one of the largest
economic development losses ever sustained by a distribution co-op.
   The allegations were raised in a class action lawsuit filed in October
by Cal McKinney, a member and harsh critic of the Collinsville, Okla.-based
co-op that in October 1993 announced a $5.68-million writeoff from an
economic development loan to Precision Tubulars, a metalworking firm that
went bankrupt without ever reaching full production (District Court of
Tulsa County, Case No. CJ-95-04552) (IEB, 20 Oct, 11).
   McKinney's suit was designed to make co-op members financially whole.
   In his answer on behalf of the co-op, Tulsa attorney Stephen Riley also
asserted that losses from the Precision deal were ``due to circumstances
beyond [the defendants'] control.'' He also asserted that an Oklahoma law
requiring member approval before a co-op can encumber or otherwise dispose
of a ``substantial'' portion of its assets does not apply in this case.
   The co-op admits to loaning Precision $6.79-million, but it denies that
this constituted a substantial portion of its assets. VVEC's current annual
report lists total assets of $57-million.
   Riley also contended that McKinney lacks standing to represent other
co-op members and that the suit is barred by the two-year statute of
limitations. He said McKinney knew or should have known of the losses to
VVEC members before it was officially announced at the October 1993 annual
meeting because of news accounts of Precision's problems starting in 1991.
   Riley said that former general manager Doyle Fulton and five current and
former trustees also named as defendants are not covered by the answer
because they have not yet been officially served with copies of the
lawsuit. An amended answer will be filed once they are served, he said.
   Riley's answer listed nine grounds on which he contends the suit should
be dismissed but also indicated that the defendants acknowledge a need for
further discovery and investigation. No procedural schedule has been set
for the case, but the discovery process is expected to be lengthy and
complex.
   This litigation marks the first time that all aspects of the Precision
deal and VVEC's involvement in it have been subject to court review. A
Washington County civil case involving much narrower issues generated one
of the largest court files in that county's history.

NYPA ASKS PSC TO KEEP OTHER UTILITIES FROM COMPETING ON INDUSTRIAL RATES

   The New York Power Authority (NYPA) has asked the New York Public
Service Commission to prevent other utilities in the state from offering
industrial incentive rates that compete with its economic development
programs. It warns that if investor-owned utilities cut rates to
industrials, other ratepayers will absorb the burden of the lost revenues,
while those customers would suffer no such impact from the NYPA discount
rates.
   Although NYPA mainly supplies wholesale power to utilities and public
agencies, it provides some low-cost power directly to industrials under an
economic development program set up by the state Legislature. This power
comes from the FitzPatrick nuclear plant and is normally given to firms
that pledge to create or retain a certain number of jobs. It runs about 4
cents/kWh, and the industrials must then pay wheeling charges to their
local utilities for delivery.
   NYPA now complains that some utilities are competing with those economic
development rates, and it wants the PSC to stop them. It has asked the
commission to review the economic development tariffs of Rochester Gas &
Electric (Case No. 94-E-0757), Niagara Mohawk Power (Case No. 94-E-0651)
and New York State Electric & Gas (Case No. 94-E-0990).
   In its petition to the PSC, NYPA states, ``The rationale for this
commission having barred the use of flexible rates to compete with
NYPA's...was clear--to avoid a conflict between complimentary state
policies encouraging the expansion and retention of business and to assure
that customers did not unduly benefit by playing suppliers off each other
to obtain discounts subsidized by other customers.''
   NYPA's petition was triggered by a dispute with RG&E over Amplaco Inc.,
a plastic molding company in the Rochester, N.Y., area. In March of this
year, NYPA trustees approved a 350-kW allocation for the firm, which agreed
to create 29 jobs and protect 186 existing positions. The NYPA allocation
was expected to save the firm $49,000 annually on its electric bills. But
in May, Amplaco notified NYPA that it intended to take power from RG&E at
an undisclosed, negotiated rate.
   NYPA responded that, ``Amplaco was satisfied with the rate it had
obtained from the authority and was prepared to make the job commitments
associated therewith. The state's economy therefore gained nothing from
RG&E's flex rate response.''
   RG&E has not formally responded to NYPA's petition, but a utility
spokesman stressed that the company's shareholders will pick up the lost
revenues for the Amplaco discount, not other ratepayers. Nevertheless,
retaining the manufacturer will help other ratepayers because lost load
forces remaining customers to absorb stranded fixed costs. The move will
also benefit the local economy.
   In earlier discussions of the issue, industrial group Multiple
Intervenors had asserted that the PSC should encourage utilities to compete
as much as possible, including with NYPA. The group is not actively
involved in the NYPA-RG&E dispute.

A PUBLIC MEETING ON GAS VALUATION ISSUES IS SET FOR JAN. 22 in Houston. The

A PUBLIC MEETING ON GAS VALUATION ISSUES IS SET FOR JAN. 22 in Houston. The
Minerals Management Service said the session is meant to gather public
comment on a proposed rulemaking, published in the Nov. 6 Federal Register,
which would implement the recommendations of the Federal Gas Valuation
Negotiated Rulemaking Committee. The panel's recommendations would amend
the rules governing the value of gas produced from federal leases.
   MMS also extended the comment period on the proposed rule until Feb. 5.
   For more information on the meeting, contact MMS' David Guzy at (303)

WESTERN STATES PLAN TO MEET OVER POSSIBLE ADOPTION OF BLM ROLES

By:
Sheryl Morris

Representatives of several Western oil and gas producing states will meet
later this month near Denver to discuss a proposal by the Clinton
administration to relinquish some of the Bureau of Land Management's
inspection and enforcement functions to the states.
Although larger producing states like New Mexico and Wyoming still have
some unanswered questions over the proposal, they believe the plan has some
merit.
   The meeting will be the first for the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact
Commission's BLM Oil and Gas Inspection and Enforcement Transfer Committee
since an organizational session at the IOGCC annual meeting in Houston last
month. Ten states have representatives on the special panel.
   Committee member, William LeMay, described the upcoming Denver session
as a ``strategy meeting'' to formulate an IOGCC consensus for presentation
to the administration. LeMay is the director of the New Mexico Oil
Conservation Division and the New Mexico governor's designated
representative to IOGCC.
   ``We think a lot of those [I&E] functions could be performed more
economically and efficiently at the state level,'' LeMay said. The key
elements, he added, are adequate funding and site-specific regulations.
   ``The same thing that's required on federal lands on the California
coastline wouldn't apply to some of the deserts in New Mexico,'' LeMay
pointed out in urging tailored regulations. ``We don't want to just be an
enforcement arm of federal rules and regulations,'' he added.
   Wyoming may be interested in the transfer if the move saves money and
both the federal government and the state benefit, said another committee
member, Donald Basko, supervisor of the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation
Commission.
   ``But if we have to follow in their footsteps'' as the land manager and
no savings result, ``then there may be no interest in taking it over,''
Basko said. ``We can maybe accomplish the same thing with fewer people and
less money, but that remains to be seen.''
   As part of Vice President Gore's campaign to re-invent government, the
Interior Dept. last year proposed the transfer of some BLM I&E functions,
as well as the abolishment of the Minerals Management Service. The latter
would have included distribution of MMS royalty functions to states and
transfer of the MMS offshore program to another agency.
   When the so-called MMS ``devolution'' was hastily retracted in the face
of intense criticism, states were caught somewhat flatfooted (IE/FL, 7 Aug,
14).
   LeMay acknowledged some fear now that Interior may repeat the MMS
scenario; what he called a ``whoops, we're sorry'' withdrawal of the
proposal involving the BLM activities.
   ``We put a lot of effort'' into studying the MMS abolishment and how New
Mexico might assume the royalty function on federal lands within its
borders, said LeMay, who noted that state officials felt Interior did not
act in ``a lot of good faith'' in offering and then retracting the MMS
plan. Because MMS is the royalty center for Interior and the BLM I&E issue
is tied to costs and revenues, there may be ``some resurrection of those
arguments'' about MMS and state assumption of royalty duties, LeMay said.
   Wyoming ranks first in revenue on mineral royalties from federal lands,
and New Mexico has the largest number of wells on federal tracts, LeMay
said in explaining the particular interest of the two states in maximizing
efficiency in governing those properties.
   While the administration has suggested the I&E transfer, LeMay said,
``we kind of need to tighten it up'' in terms of how the move would be
accomplished. States want answers regarding potential savings, funding
options and personnel needs, he said. ``Each state may have a little
different viewpoint,'' LeMay noted, but the object is consensus ``so we do
not have five or six of the largest states each proposing something
different.''
   Nevada's representative on the committee said ``conceptually it makes a
lot of sense for states to play a greater role in I&E on public lands
because, for the most part, many of us are either doing it concurrently or
doing that work in some sort of cooperative memorandum of understanding
with BLM right now.''
   Russell Fields, administrator of the Nevada Division of Minerals,
pointed out that his state and BLM have an MOU to reduce duplication and
effort. Were the state to take a larger role, it would have to be
``adequately compensated for work done on federal lands,'' he said.
   Beyond I&E, states may be ``interested in what other oil and gas
functions they rightfully should take on,'' Fields said, such as authority
to issue and maintain leases and collect royalties.
   Nevada would not be interested ``in just becoming the cops for the
feds,'' Fields said. States may be more interested if the government wants
something more than just I&E transfer, Fields said, such as an integrated
program with the goal of more efficient use of resources.
   The I&E Committee session is slated for Jan. 26 in Aurora, Colo. Other
states represented on the panel include Utah, Louisiana, California, North
Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Nebraska.

WILDERNESS SOCIETY FINDS NEW CONGRESS `WORST EVER' ON ENVIRONMENT

Support for bills to open the Arctic National Wildlife coastal plain to oil
and gas development and reform the Endangered Species Act are just two
elements of a grievous environmental record that makes the 104th Congress
the ``worst Congress ever,'' The Wilderness Society has charged in a new
report.
   ``The hard-liners in this Congress make James Watt look timid,''
Wilderness Society President Jon Roush said in releasing the study Dec. 27.
``They have a playbook written by the mining, logging, and ranching
industries, and they're hacking away at everything except the subsidies
enjoyed by those industries.''
   In the report, the Society termed the new Congress ``a worse
environmental accident than the Exxon Valdez,'' and said the ``election of
many zealots whose allegiance is to the extractive industries'' threatens
many of the nation's natural resource treasures.
   The study singled out for criticism the record of some newly powerful
lawmakers, including Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, chairman of the House
Resources Committee, Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, chairman of the House
Resources subcommittee on national parks, forests and lands, Rep. John
Doolittle, R-Calif., chairman of the House Resources subcommittee on water
and power resources, Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate
Energy Committee, and Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., chairman of the Senate
Appropriations interior subcommittee.
   The leadership changes have placed in power members who have tried for
years to rewrite environmental protection laws, the society warned.
   ``The most threatening aspect of this realignment is that the
development-at-all-costs Alaskan delegation heads both resources
committees,'' the report said. In addition, should Sen. Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, replace retiring Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., as chair of the
Senate Appropriations Committee, the Wilderness Society warned that
``[s]enators casting swing votes will be under enormous pressure to go
along with the Alaskan delegation's agenda.''
   Environmental groups have strenuously opposed any oil development in the
1.5-million-acre ANWR coast plain, but the Alaska delegation managed to
include language authorizing ANWR leasing in the budget reconciliation
package that President Clinton vetoed last month. The future of the
provision remained uncertain last week as Congress and the president
continued discussions on the budget and partial government shutdown.
   The GOP-led Congress appears intent on gutting the nation's endangered
species statute, the report added, with major ESA reform bills introduced
by Sens. Gorton (S. 768) and Dirk Kempthorne, R-Idaho, (S. 1364), and Reps.
Young and Richard Pombo, R-Calif., (H.R. 2275).
   While the three bills differ, the report charged they all would allow
some species to go extinct, curtail ESA's protections of species' habitat
on private land, limit protection for subspecies, and require taxpayers to
pay developers not to destroy habitat if protections would diminish the
property value.
   The report also attacked the language in two FY-96 Interior
appropriations bills, both vetoed by the president, that would place a
temporary moratorium on listing of new endangered species and designation
of critical habitat.
   Republican lawmakers' intent to dismantle the National Biological
Service also drew criticism, as The Wilderness Society noted the opposition
of extractive industries and real estate interests to NBS. The service was
created by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt in 1993 to consolidate the
biological science expertise within the department.
   NBS would be eliminated and its functions transferred to the U.S.
Geological Survey under the Interior appropriations measures vetoed by
Clinton.
   In other complaints, the report objected to what it termed ``give-away''
legislation, supported by some GOP lawmakers, that would allow states to
take over Bureau of Land Management lands within their borders. It also
attacked ``takings'' measures passed in the House and by the Senate
Judiciary Committee that would compensate landowners when environmental
protection actions by the government degrades their property values.
   Lifting of the Alaskan oil export ban was folly, the report added. While
Stevens argued for repeal of the ban, saying it forced shipment of Alaskan
crude to West Coast markets where it created a glut and depressed prices,
the report noted the senator, in contrast, ``insists that there is an oil
shortage'' when he advocates drilling of ANWR.
   The Society group noted, overall, ``The most important question as 1995
turns to 1996 is probably how vigilant and outspoken Americans will be'' on
environmental issues. It said polls indicate the ``public is firmly
committed to environmental protection and wants to see more progress rather
than an unraveling of current law.''
   The report, ``The Worst Congress Ever: A Review of the Environmental
Record of the 104th Congress at Mid-point and the Outlook for 1996,'' is
available from The Wilderness Society at (202) 833-2300.

OSM PLANS TO CONDUCT EMERGENCY INSPECTIONS IF FURLOUGH CONTINUES

A limited number of federal inspectors will visit surface mines on federal
and Indian lands on an emergency basis this week if the partial government
shutdown continues, Office of Surface Mining Deputy Director Ed Kay said
Thursday.
   Fewer than 10 OSM inspectors will likely be involved in the effort after
they have been designated essential personnel by agency officials.
   The reason for the special designations is that ``nothing is being
done'' to oversee lands where OSM has the primary inspection function
because of the government closure, Kay said. Partial visits are needed ``to
make sure everything is okay,'' the deputy director added, noting that the
Interior Dept. solicitor has approved such inspections on a limited basis.
   Although primacy states conduct the necessary inspections within their
borders, OSM is responsible for assuring health and safety on lands in
Washington and Tennessee, where it is the primary enforcer, as well as on
Indian lands in New Mexico and Arizona and federal lands in Kentucky.
   At OSM's Western Region Coordinating Center in Denver, processing of 100
Indian and 50 federal permits has stopped, its director, Richard Seibel,
said.
   The federal shutdown may also hamper issuance of permits by states,
which have been unable to use OSM's Applicant Violator System since the
agency closed, Seibel said. States check companies through AVS for
outstanding permit violations before issuing new permits, he noted. Losing
access to AVS may delay the states' issuance of new permits.
   OSM is dealing with emergency situations with a skeleton staff, Kay
said. The fact that most surface-mining crises occur during other parts of
the year, when there is typically more rain, makes coping with the current
situation somewhat easier for the agency, he added.

CONSERVANCY FINDS ONE-THIRD OF NATION'S PLANTS, ANIMALS THREATENED

The Nature Conservancy issued a 1996 species report card last week in which
it warned that the survival of one-third of the nation's plants and animals
is threatened, particularly those species dependent on rivers, lakes and
streams. More than 500 scientists examined more than 20,000 U.S. species.
   The troubles of freshwater aquatic species were attributed to poor water
quality and long-term effects of dams and other water diversions. ``These
figures clearly show that efforts to protect the nation's water quality
will not only benefit people, but also these species,'' said John Sawhill,
president and chief executive of the Nature Conservancy.
   The data compiled in the annual report is used by federal and state
resource managers to decide on land use, and by private businesses and
individuals to design projects that do not harm sensitive species and
habitat, the Conservancy said.
   The Conservancy described the report, ``Priorities for Conservation:
1996 Annual Report Card for U.S. Plant and Animal Species,'' as the ``most
comprehensive assessment to date on the conservation status of U.S.
species.''
   The group found that one species, the Merriam's Bearpaw Poppy, a desert
wildflower, is doing better than thought. The wildflower is more abundant
on a Nevada military base than previously known, it said.
   ``Based on this find by Conservancy botanists, the plant probably will
not need to be listed under the federal Endangered Species Act,'' the group
said.
   The animal groups listed as most at risk were: freshwater mussels,
crayfish, freshwater fish, and amphibians.
   The report was a NatureServe publication, sponsored by Canon U.S.A. Inc.
as part of its Clean Earth Campaign. Information on the report is available
from the Conservancy's Larry Carpman at (703) 841-8740.

THE DEADLINE IS MARCH 7 TO FILE COMMENTS ON SURETY RULES under revision by

THE DEADLINE IS MARCH 7 TO FILE COMMENTS ON SURETY RULES under revision by
the Minerals Management Service. The agency said it is considering creation
of a deadline of two years for all Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas
lessees to bring their bond coverage into compliance with new levels of
coverage established in 1993.
   The proposed regulations would clarify MMS' position that ``assignees,
assignors, and co-lessees are jointly and severally liable for compliance''
with OCS lease requirements. The rules also would establish a framework for
lease-specific abandonment accounts and acceptance of a third-party
guarantee, and would update the bond coverage required for right-of-way
holders and geological and geophysical exploration permittees.
   MMS said the changes were needed in order to ``reduce the risk of
default by an underfunded company operating a lease or holding a
right-of-way.''
   For more information, contact Gerald Rhodes of the MMS engineering and
technology division at (703) 787-1609.

DOE ISSUES FINAL RFP FOR HANFORD WORK

By:
Mary Powers, Birmingham, Ala.

DOE Thursday released a final request for proposals for a five-year
management and integration contract at its Hanford Site that for the first
time includes specific performance objectives and measures.
   The RFP is the latest large site management contract issued under the
agency's two-year-old contract reform initiative and is the first to
include performance objectives specified by DOE. Until now, DOE has relied
on bidders to propose such benchmarks.
   DOE said it will attach incentives to a number of the performance
measures to reward contractors for making progress toward cleanup. The
complete fee structure is open for negotiation, however, and will be
proposed by each bidder. Proposals could include a base fee or could be
100% incentive fee. ``We don't want to discourage any innovative thinking
by bidders,'' said a DOE spokesman. The contract has an estimated value of
$4.6 billion over its five-year duration.
   The language in the final RFP was strengthened from that contained in a
draft RFP released last year to emphasize cost-effective innovative
approaches and to include cost reductions in specific areas, such as
overhead and indirect costs, the agency said. Bidders' past performance as
well as their proposed approach to cost reduction will be weighed during
selection. The RFP specifically outlines an aggressive ``make-or-pay''
program that requires work to be contracted out or privatized if it is more
efficient to do so.
   The contract covers all work at Hanford that is not included in the
environmental restoration management contract now held by Bechtel Hanford
Corp. It includes the cleanup of the waste tanks and spent fuel, as well as
infrastructure management, base operations, construction and construction
management. The statement of work included in the final RFP is organized
around what DOE calls ``Project Hanford,'' an effort to duplicate the best
administrative and management controls found in the private sector.
   Proposals are due March 15. DOE says it will make a final selection in
June, with the winner to take over operations Oct. 1. Three, and possibly
four, companies have lined up teams to bid on the Hanford management and
integration contract.
   California-based Fluor Daniel Inc.. is leading a team that includes
Lockheed-Martin; Rust Federal Services; Babcock and Wilcox; Duke Energy and
Services, Numatec and International Technology Corp. Bechtel Corp., which
has the environmental restoration contract at Hanford now, is leading a
team that includes Westinghouse; BNFL Inc.; Computer Sciences Corp., and
Johnson Controls. A third team led by Boston-based Raytheon Corp. includes
CH2M Hill; ICF Kaiser; Tenneco Boeing Information Services Corp., and
Siemens Power Corp.
   Sources last week said a fourth team may be organizing under TRW Inc.'s
and Parsons Corp.'s lead. None of the three teams are final yet, and the
sources said other companies will be added as the final RFP is examined. A
Bechtel spokesman said its team will include several more pre-selected
subcontractors, but that most of the subcontracted work will be
competitively bid after the contract is awarded.
   The contract out for bid is now held by Westinghouse and ICF Kaiser. At
least one industry source gives Bechtel the best odds at winning. ``It has
the strongest team because it includes two large contract holders there
now,'' the source said. Others, however, argue the opposite, saying that
Bechtel can't win because Westinghouse is on its team. ``That company is
the kiss of death out there,'' he said.
   Meanwhile contractors are waiting for the RFP that will replace EG&G at
DOE's Mound site. DOE has promised a draft will be issued between Jan. 15
and Feb. 8. Sources said a number of teams want to bid on the much smaller
$500 million contract.
   ``We're lucky that these two are coming out close together. The big
players are looking at Hanford, leaving the smaller companies to pursue
Mound,'' one source said. The job will include cleaning up the site and
returning the assets to the City of Miamisburg, Ohio, and is expected to be
valued at $80 to $100 million a year for five years.
   International Technology Corp. is planning to lead a team, while sources
say Fluor Daniel's management team at DOE's nearby Fernald Environmental
Management Project will also bid the job. Other players looking to lead or
join teams include ICF Kaiser, Babcock & Wilcox, Parsons, Morrison Knudsen,
Weston, SAIC, Foster Wheeler, and TRW.
    ``There's lots of mating dances going on here,'' said an industry
source, who along with other company officials are in Ohio planning their
strategy.

BOB ALCOCK HAS BEEN NAMED ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY for congressional,
intergovernmental and public affairs at DOE. Alcock, who most recently
worked as deputy assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs,
replaced Carolyn Herr Watts, who left the agency for the private sector
last month.
   The White House has nominated and the Senate Energy Committee has
confirmed Derrick Forrister. a former special assistant to Energy Secretary
Hazel O'Leary, for the assistant secretary job, but the nomination has been
blocked in the Senate since last summer.
   Alcock worked as former Texas Democratic Rep. Barbara Jordan's
legislative assistant from l1973 to 1979 and, after two years in the
private sector, returned to Congress as chief of staff to California
Democratic Rep. Esteban Torres.
   He was named deputy assistant secretary in February 1994. In that
position, he was responsible for providing liaison between DOE and various
state and local government officials including governors, mayors, state
legislators, county supervisors and tribal leaders.

GAO SAYS SPENDING GAPS TYPICAL FOR DOE

DOE's inability to document $255,000 in expenses it incurred on two trade
missions to India and South Africa are part of a ``systemic''
record-keeping problem at the department that may date back to the
Manhattan Project, an official with the General Accounting Office said
Thursday.
   At a hearing before the House Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations, Victor Rezendes, GAO's director of energy, resources and
science issues, said his office found DOE was unable to provide records for
$80,000 in expenses it claimed for an October 1994 trade mission to India
and $175,000 in charges made during a similar trip to South Africa in
August.
   In both instances, GAO said, the money was paid by U.S. embassies in the
countries for goods and services purchased on behalf of the DOE
delegations.
   Rezendes, whose office looked into the cost of the two trips at the
request of Ohio Republican Rep. Martin Hoke, a critic of Energy Secretary
Hazel O'Leary's overseas travel, told the subcommittee that DOE did not
have written procedures in place during either of the trips specifying what
types of records were to be kept or the process to follow when obtaining
travel support from the State Dept.
   For both trips, Rezendes said, embassies reported charges to DOE that
listed the amounts paid to vendors. ``The lists sometimes, but not always,
provided a brief description of the nature of the charges,'' he said.
   ``DOE's accounting office recorded the charges in DOE's accounts, but
relied on the responsible program office to approve the charges. However,
the program officials did not maintain supporting documents of the expenses
incurred,'' he said. Further, Rezendes said that in some cases, the program
officials ``could not provide an explanation for the embassies' charges.''
   DOE, Rezendes added, could not provide GAO auditors with supporting
documents to ``give assurances of what the money was spent for. This is not
a new problem at DOE and without the documentation, we don't know, nor does
DOE know, what the money was spent on.''
   ``We want to ensure that double billing did not occur, and maybe there
charges are perfectly okay, but the point is we don't know,'' he said.
   Rezendes said the problem of shoddy bookkeeping at DOE precedes O'Leary
and may, in fact, have its origins in the Manhattan Project. ``This goes
back a long time and probably predates DOE, the [Atomic Energy Commission]
and goes back to the Manhattan Project. The United States government, in
its effort to build the atomic bomb, agreed to total cost reimbursement.
Everything was allowable and after the war the same total cost
reimbursement system was retained,'' he said.
   ``Anytime we have looked at DOE with a microscope we have found a lack
of documentation and an understanding of what it is paying for,'' Rezendes
added.
   Questioned by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., Rezendes said his
investigation failed to turn up any evidence of improper or illegal use of
federal funds, but he added that the problem is there is insufficient
documentation available yet to make a conclusive determination.
   Rezendes credited O'Leary for making ``the most aggressive changes'' of
any of her predecessors in the agency's contracting process and said DOE,
working with GAO, is working to develop written procedures that would
require DOE officials traveling abroad to follow specific steps, such as
completing certain documents and vouchers and submitting all required
receipts in support of travel expenses to the agency's accounting office.
``If properly implemented, these procedures should prevent similar problems
from occurring in the future,'' he added.
   The GAO report was critical of DOE's decision to change the source of
funding for security staff accompanying O'Leary on overseas trips from the
agency's administration account to its Defense Programs account. DOE
transferred $400,000 from the DP account to pay for the security costs in
FY-95.
   The decision, Rezendes said, ``is inconsistent with a long-standing
principle of appropriations accounting.'' DOE acted improperly, GAO said,
by using the Defense Programs money to cover the security costs without
first informing Congress.
   Congress has already acted to address the problem, Rezendes said. In the
FY-96 energy and water development appropriations act, Congress directed
that all costs to support the travel of any security detail accompanying
O'Leary are to be paid out of the departmental administration account.
   House Republicans used last week's hearing to reissue a demand that
O'Leary resign.
   Hoke, in an opening statement, said DOE, under O'Leary's leadership,
``has unfortunately become a glaring symbol of government waste.''
   ``Up until now, most of the media focus has been on Secretary O'Leary's
lavish excessive travel -- 100 trips -- which in itself is a serious
problem.
   However, that is just the tip of a mismanagement iceberg that masks the
much larger problem of profound agency chaos, with tens of millions of
dollars in lost computers and other property, hundreds of thousands of
dollars unaccounted for, special perks for special friends, a useless and
stupid waste of $43,000 to rate the friendliness of reporters, editorial
boards, and members of Congress, illegal lobbying, hundreds of full-time
employees devoted to public relations and the secretary's personal
image-building, and countless other examples of waste, fraud and abuse,''
he said.
   House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley, R-Va., joined his
colleagues in condemning O'Leary's travel. ``It is becoming more and more
clear to me that under the current leadership, [DOE] has little respect for
the American taxpayer. The secretary and her entourage of hundreds travel
in luxury at taxpayer's expense throughout the world.
   ``Yet, according to the findings in the GAO report, they don't even care
enough to keep a single, solitary receipt for more than a quarter-million
dollars expended on just these two trips alone. And when they run short of
travel funds, they violate nearly a century's worth of budget principles to
drain other funds to pick up the tab,'' he said.
   Subcommittee Democrats voiced support, arguing that no evidence had been
provided that showed money had been misused and that the problem may be
nothing more than an accounting glitch.
   Dingell, in his opening statement, questioned why the panel had not
asked DOE or State Dept. officials to testify about the trips. ``I hope it
doesn't show that we are more interested in a political hatchet job than we
are in finding the truth,'' he said. State Dept. employees have been
furloughed by the government shutdown.
   DOE said Wednesday that it had received ``summary statements that show
that each expenditure incurred was certified by a State Department
official.'' While DOE said it had not received every voucher to determine
whether it should have paid all of the certified expenses, it expects to
receive those documents when the federal shutdown ends.
   DOE also said it disagreed with GAO's criticism of its decision to pay
for security on foreign trips with $400,000 from Defense Program accounts,
which officials noted have been used for some time for security on domestic
travel. ``We stand by our decision to use the same appropriation account
for security for both foreign and domestic travel,'' DOE said.

O'LEARY ATTEMPTS TO CLEAR AIR OVER IMPACT OF OVERSEAS EXCURSIONS

Exactly how much new business has been gained by U.S. companies by virtue
of DOE's four overseas trade missions was still an open question last
week.
   In a Dec. 28 letter to Congress, Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said
company executives who accompanied her on the trips have told the agency
they have completed, or are close to finalizing, $4.3 billion in deals that
could be tied to the missions.
   O'Leary's letter came in response to a Dec. 20 request from the chairmen
of seven House Committees and subcommittees asking the secretary to explain
what they described as apparent multibillion-dollar discrepancies in the
economic benefits she said companies have gained from her overseas travel
(IE/FL, 25 Dec, 1).
   At various times, O'Leary has claimed the trips have resulted in as much
as $27.7 billion and as little as $2.4 billion in new business for U.S.
companies.
   At a hearing last week before the House Commerce subcommittee on
oversight and investigations, however, Ohio Republican Rep. Martin Hoke
said his own survey of company officials put the value of the trips at
about $1.4 billion. Hoke suggested, moreover, that even that figure may be
generous.
   Hoke, who has been a harsh critic of O'Leary's travel, said the
secretary's trade missions are the product of an agency undergoing a
``bureaucratic midlife crisis, desperately pretending to be something it is
not in an attempt to find a new purpose to justify its continued
existence.''
   O'Leary, he continued, ``often acts more like the head of a state
chamber of commerce trade delegation ... than a member of the president's
Cabinet charged with the profoundly important, if somewhat dull,
responsibility of safeguarding the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile.''
   Just how much new business the trade missions have returned to U.S.
companies is important to determining how effective the trips have been,
Hoke said.
   The congressman said O'Leary originally claimed that the trade missions
to India, Pakistan, China and South Africa resulted in $19.7 billion worth
of contracts for U.S. companies. Recently, however, in response to a
newspaper inquiry, DOE said $2.4 billion in deals had been signed. On Dec.
19, the agency revised the figure to $4.3 billion.
   Hoke said he believes the actual number is probably closer to $1.4
billion. Even that number is ``guesswork,'' Hoke said, adding that most of
the contracts were won by large U.S. companies with strong international
representation. They were capable, he said, of securing the contracts
without DOE's help.
   In her letter to Congress, O'Leary attempted to clear the air. In
testimony she delivered to the Senate in March, O'Leary estimated that
energy-related business agreements advanced during DOE and Commerce
Dept.-sponsored trade missions had a combined potential and realized value
of $27.7 billion.
   A later estimate of $19.7 billion represents realized and potential
agreements of energy-related deals that have come out of DOE trade
missions. They include, she said, ``memoranda of intent or understanding
 ... , power purchase agreements, fuel supply agreements and other steps
necessary to advance business deals. The $19.7 billion estimate represents
the total potential value of the deals advanced by the trade missions that
I headed and is an important guidepost for tracking the long-term success
of the missions.''
   As for the $4.3 billion figure, O'Leary said that represents the number
of deals that have been completed. The $2.4 billion estimate DOE gave
earlier this year in response to an inquiry from the Los Angeles Times did
not include several deals companies later reported as completed.
   In her letter, O'Leary told members that while the trade missions have
provided U.S. companies with new contracts and have created American jobs,
business deals are not the only benefits that have accrued.
   DOE trade missions ``help shape policies that support the success of
U.S. competitiveness, democratization and market economies,'' she said.
   ``Our missions have encouraged countries to create the necessary legal,
financial, and regulatory policies that are the cornerstone of market
economies, while also enabling projects with U.S. energy companies to reach
closure. ... Every nation in which we have conducted trade missions has
further endorsed market reforms in the energy sector, and I believe our
work has greatly contributed to that progress.''
   The trips have also helped create a ``level playing field'' for U.S.
business, O'Leary said. U.S. businesses have asked for DOE's help and
Congress has given DOE the authority to provide assistance, ``because these
markets are important to their future and because foreign competitors enjoy
strong support from their governments.''
   O'Leary said DOE will continue to track the progress of the dollar-value
of the trade missions, but warned that because the emerging markets
involved in the trade missions have little experience in competitive
markets, the final dollar figure for successful projects advanced during
the trips may not be known for five to 10 years.

E. SHIRLEY THOMAS, DOE OMBUDSMAN AND FRIEND OF SECRETARY HAZEL O'LEARY, has
been notified she will have to repay between $20,000 and $25,000 she has
received as a living allowance for nearly two years, but for which she was
ineligible.
   A department spokeswoman said Thomas was informed by the agency's Office
of General Counsel that she will have to pay back a $35 per day allowance
she had received as an allowance for maintaining her principal residence in
Newark, where she was employed as a social worker before being tapped by
O'Leary for the $93,000-a-year DOE post. In fact, Thomas moved to the
Washington area in December 1993.
   DOE spokeswoman Barbara Semedo said Thomas was said to be ``eager'' to
repay the funds. Thomas could not be reached for comment.
   O'Leary in November defended Thomas against charges from House
Republicans that her job is unnecessary and that she was appointed to the
post chiefly because of their longtime friendship.

BUDGET CUT FORCES LAYOFF OF PART-TIME AND STUDENT WORKERS AT DOE

Although a DOE plan to meet congressional cuts in the agency's
administration budget spared full-time employees from layoffs, 32 part-time
workers and student interns were not as lucky.
   DOE last week said it will lay off nine part-time workers, eight of whom
were employed in the agency's mailroom, and 23 college and high school
students, to help it comply with a congressional directive that it cut
administrative staff by 15% this year.
   In its FY-96 energy and water development appropriations bill, Congress
reduced funding for DOE's administration $41 million below what the
department had sought. In report language accompanying the bill, the
lawmakers said the funding level assumed a 15% cut in DOE's workforce.
   The administration budget pays the salaries and other operating expenses
for about 2,900 employees in non-program offices, including human
resources, the office of congressional and public affairs, policy field
management and the Idaho, Oak Ridge and Chicago field offices.
   DOE managers and union representatives signed off on a plan shortly
before Christmas that would comply with the congressional requirement yet
spare forced layoffs through such actions as increasing the number of
workers opting for early retirement, eliminating overtime spending and
performance bonuses, continuing a hiring freeze and furloughing each
employee for at least 48 hours spread out over the current fiscal year
(IE/FL, 25 Dec, 12).
   The plan, however, does call for some forced reductions. A DOE official
last week said 32 workers will be laid off. Under the plan, the nine
temporary employees will be dismissed from the agency on or before Jan.
26.
   Twenty-three student employees -- including college students working in
the department's cooperative education program and high school students
employed under the agency's ``Stay in School'' program -- will get their
walking papers.
   Under the cooperative education program, DOE gives college students the
opportunity to gain professional experience while they work toward their
degrees. Upon graduation, the students have the opportunity to move into
full-time permanent positions at the agency.
   The Stay in School program involves clerical work largely for high
school students, whose financial situation may otherwise force them to drop
out before matriculating.
   Eligibility for both programs is based on financial need. Students in
both programs will be asked to leave their jobs by April 19, the official
said.
   Department-wide, DOE will retain 40 college students in the cooperative
education program and six under the Stay in School program, the official
said. In addition, officials are hoping that some of the 23 students will
be picked up by DOE program offices that are not facing the same salary
restrictions as is the department administration account.

ERVIN SAYS DIVISION WILL CUT STAFF BY ONE-THIRD OVER NEXT FIVE YEARS

By:
Lira Behrens

As part of its effort to comply with DOE's Strategic Alignment Initiative,
DOE's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy division is aiming to cut
staff by a third and reduce administrative costs by 50% over the next five
years.
   EERE Assistant Secretary Christine Ervin told reporters in a briefing
Thursday that it was unclear where the cuts would be made, but two-thirds
of them would likely be made in the first two years. Many of the cuts also
will come from closing four of the 10 EERE Regional Support Offices that
was announced in August.
   The administrative improvements will come from a new computerized
personnel center the division hopes to unveil in February, as well as a
partnership with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which Ervin said
has ``its own aggressive program to reduce administrative costs.'' A team
of EERE employees has already identified 67 processes where ``there might
be major savings,'' she said.
   Ervin described the restructuring of the division as ``not a dramatic
reorganization, but a natural evolution.''
  One major effect of the change, Ervin said, would be to decrease the
ratio of managers to staff within the division from 1:5 to 1:15. Doing so,
she said, would ``push decisionmaking down in the organization, giving more
authority to the staff.''
   The other major change effected by the reorganization is what she termed
``graduation day'' for the division's Office of Technical and Financial
Assistance. The office, which deals primarily with state and local
assistance programs, has previously been in a ``separate box,'' which she
said had been an obstacle to deployment of EERE's r&d programs.
   Under the new organization, OTFA's Weatherization Assistance Program and
State Energy Conservation Program grants would be housed with the
division's building energy programs under a new Office of Building Systems
and State and Community Programs. Mary Fowler, who had been OTFA's acting
deputy assistant secretary, is now the associate deputy assistant secretary
for the new office.
   Ervin said the lack of an Interior appropriations bill (which funds the
division's efficiency programs) has not required employee furloughs or
cutbacks in grants because the department has money left over from FY-95
and so-called ``no-year money.'' According to Ervin's Chief of Staff Brian
Castelli, the programs could operate ``a few more months'' on the outyear
funding.
   One program Ervin said has been delayed by the government shutdown is
the implementation of an agreement reached in early December with the
Environmental Protection Agency to consolidate the two agencies' appliance
efficiency labeling programs. EPA, whose funding bill has not been
approved, has an ``energy star'' program that labels computers and other
appliances as energy efficient, while DOE is responsible for setting energy
efficiency standards for appliances.
   According to Ervin, DOE and EPA have worked with retailers such as
Circuit City, Sears and Home Depot on what the new labels should look like.
The department had hoped to complete the label consolidation by the end of
the year, but has been unable to meet with EPA because the agency's
employees are furloughed.
   In other programs, Ervin said the department plans to issue final
guidelines for Home Energy Rating Systems by January 31. The department has
asked the Home Energy Ratings Systems Council and several state-run HERS
programs known as the Residential Energy Services Network, to resolve their
differences on technical issues related to the guidelines before then.
   Members of the HERS Council, which submitted recommended guidelines to
DOE in October 1994, late last year expressed concern that the disagreement
threatened the program (IE/FL, 30 Oct, 7). The groups have now apparently
narrowed the list of issues over which they disagree and have tentatively
scheduled a series of meetings for mid-January.

HOUSE BID TO OVERRIDE CLINTON VETO OF INTERIOR SPENDING BILL FAILS

House Republicans failed to override President Clinton's veto of the
Interior appropriations bill Thursday, garnering only 239 of the 278 votes
needed to pass the bill over Clinton's objections.
   Among the reasons the president said he vetoed the bill (H.R. 1977) was
that it did not contain enough funding for DOE's energy efficiency programs
(IE/FL, 25 Dec, 4). According to administration sources, the bill's future
will likely hinge on the White House's negotiations with Congress on the
overall budget agreement.
   Sources familiar with the negotiations last week said advocates of the
efficiency programs in the White House were asking for $75 million in
additional FY-96 funding to be split between three efficiency programs: the
Weatherization Assistance Program, the Partnership for a new Generation of
Vehicles program, and the programs aimed at implementing the
administration's Climate Change Action Plan.
   A congressional aide, however, denied that the overall budget
negotiations would affect the FY-96 Interior appropriations bill. The aide
said it was unclear what appropriators would do with the interior bill. The
two options, she said, were to either move another stand-alone bill, or
roll funding for the programs into a long-term continuing resolution.
   The FY-97 budget request process is apparently on hold until the FY-96
budget levels are settled. DOE has submitted a budget request to the Office
of Management and Budget of $915 million for EERE, but it was unclear at
press time how that may have been changed during the ``passback'' process.
   Of the outlook for FY-97 funding for her programs, DOE Assistant
Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Christine Ervin told
reporters last week that ``a lot of it is hinging on the negotiations for
FY-96.''
   While she would not divulge details of the FY-97 request until it has
been submitted to Congress by the president, Ervin said the ``historic
percentage increases [in efficiency and renewable energy programs] in past
years are not likely to continue. We do know that energy efficiency and
renewable energy remain a high priority for the secretary and the
administration.'' And she added there will be ``some decent continuations
for programs.''

DOE WILL PROVIDE $100,000 TO JAMES E. RUSSELL PETROLEUM INC., to improve a

DOE WILL PROVIDE $100,000 TO JAMES E. RUSSELL PETROLEUM INC., to improve a
new process to clean water used in oil field operations.
   The ``air flotation process'' emerged from an earlier DOE co-sponsored
project with Russell Petroleum and the University of Kansas. Russell
Petroleum, Abilene, Texas, will contribute $102,000 of its own to continue
research on the project. DOE's award will be made through the National
Institute for Petroleum Energy Research in Bartlesville, Okla.
   According to DOE, water produced with oil is often reinjected into the
reservoir to increase the efficiency of the oil recovery operation. But
impurities in the water can plug the tiny pores in the reservoir rock,
often blocking the water from reaching the target zones.
   In the air flotation process, air is bubbled through a flotation column.
Waste impurities cling to the air bubbles and are removed from the water.
The technique, a modification of a process originally developed to clean
coal and other minerals, has been used in some offshore oil operations. It
was unclear, however, whether the process would be cost-effective for
onshore oil fields, particularly those operated by smaller, independent
producers.
   According to the department, the original Russell Petroleum project
showed that the air flotation device may make economic sense for many
independent producers. The company credits the technology with contributing
to the recovery of some 300,000 barrels of oil that otherwise would have
been left in the ground.
   Under the second phase of the project, which will last 18 months,
Russell Petroleum will develop screening criteria to help other producers
determine where and when the process can be applied; develop optimum design
and operating guidelines for the technology; determine the cost of
implementing critical design improvements; and communicate the correct
method of applying the technology and its benefits to other operators.
   The original project was funded under DOE's Reservoir Class Field
Demonstration Program, which is aimed at demonstrating ways that oil
producers can avoid prematurely abandoning their wells. The Russell
Petroleum follow-on project is the result of a solicitation DOE issued to
the 33 participants in the ``near-term'' category of the program. The
department has recently requested proposals for follow-on projects from
participants in ``mid-term'' and other categories of the program.

THE NUCLEAR ENERGY INSTITUTE MISTAKENLY LISTED A CONSUMER GROUP among

THE NUCLEAR ENERGY INSTITUTE MISTAKENLY LISTED A CONSUMER GROUP among
supporters of a bill aimed at fixing DOE's high-level nuclear waste
program.
   In an ad NEI placed in the Dec. 12, 13 and 14 Washington editionS of the
Los Angeles Times, the industry group included the Consumer Federation of
America in a list of organizations it said support the bill (H.R. 1020). In
a letter to the paper's editor, CFA Executive Director Stephen Brobeck said
the group did not approve the use of its name in the ad and that it has no
position on the bill.
   Brobeck, who asked the paper to print a correction, said NEI ``has
admitted their error and apologized to us.''
   The ad was brought to the attention of CFA by several state Public
Interest Research Groups, who are members of the federation, and who oppose
the bill.
   U.S. PIRG said the incident ``is just one more example of the brazen
excess the nuclear industry uses to ram a destructive bill through
Congress.''
   An NEI spokeswoman Friday acknowledged the group made a mistake in
including CFA among those groups endorsing the bill. She, however, said CFA
was included because the group had passed a resolution urging Congress to
ensure that money paid by consumers into the nuclear waste fund was used
for the program. That provision, she added, is a key part of the
legislation.
   The spokeswoman criticized PIRG, saying the group was allowing its
``anti-nuclear views to get in the way of protecting consumers.''

EEI PRESIDENT THOMAS KUHN WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF CONGRESS waits until

EEI PRESIDENT THOMAS KUHN WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF CONGRESS waits until
the end of the session to decide on nuclear waste legislation. That's when
the first two laws addressing the topic passed in 1982 and 1987, Kuhn said
during a briefing last week for the Washington International Energy Group,
and he suggested that history may repeat itself this year.
   Nevertheless, the Edison Electric Institute chief said a bill reported
overwhelmingly by the House Commerce Committee in August could be the start
of a new law this year. He said he thought the measure (H.R. 1020), which
would require DOE to open an interim site for nuclear waste in Nevada by
1998, may pass the House handily if it gets to the floor. That, he added,
would ``motivate'' the Senate to respond similarly.
   ``Hopefully, the issue is important enough that it will percolate up and
be finished this year,'' Kuhn said of a nuclear waste bill. ``There is a
critical need for it.''
   Kuhn was less sanguine that Congress will reconsider proposals to sell
DOE's power marketing administrations, which EEI supported in 1995, but
which failed because of opposition in the regions where the PMAs operate.
He credited the public power and rural cooperative portions of the electric
utility sector for their successful fight against the proposals.
   ``I don't really believe there will be a very active discussion of the
issue this year, but I do believe it will be back in the next Congress,''
Kuhn said of the PMAs. The fact that the PMAs operate with a federal
``subsidy'' will draw more scrutiny as the notion of competition in the
overall utility sector gains support nationally, he added.
   While EEI wants lawmakers' help on nuclear waste and the PMAs, the group
would prefer that they abstain from addressing retail wheeling or
competition in the utility industry, he said. Kuhn acknowledged that
proposals by House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley Jr., R-Va.,
and other lawmakers that address those issues likely will be discussed
further this year, but he said he hoped nothing would come of them.
   ``We very strongly feel we don't need federally mandated wheeling,'' he
said. ``We don't need a federal solution regarding competition.'' According
to Kuhn, utilities in conjunction with state regulators and other interests
are likely to find solutions to problems related to competition that will
be better than any prescriptions from Washington.

A PANEL CHAIRED BY DOE AND EPA HAVE SELECTED EIGHT PROJECTS involving four

A PANEL CHAIRED BY DOE AND EPA HAVE SELECTED EIGHT PROJECTS involving four
countries and 13 U.S. companies under the second round of the U.S.
Initiative on Joint Implementation.
   The pilot program encourages partnerships between U.S. companies and
developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to DOE,
the program ``spurs technology cooperation by increasing the access of
developing countries to energy-efficiency and renewable energy
technologies. Industrialized countries benefit through the expansion of
export markets.''
   Should a greenhouse gas control program be implemented in the future,
U.S. companies hope they would be able to get credit for reducing emissions
overseas, where such reduction measures are cheaper to implement.
   The projects announced last week, which are financed by the private
sector, will employ geothermal, biomass, hydroelectric and wind energy
technologies, as well as forest management practices in Costa Rica,
Honduras, Nicaragua and Russia.
   Five of the eight projects -- selected from 21 proposals submitted --
are located in Costa Rica. At a ceremony announcing the selected projects
last month, DOE Deputy Energy Secretary Charles Curtis attributed the
number of projects in Costa Rica to its president, Jose Maria Figueres, who
has created a special office of joint implementation and has vowed to
``make Costa Rica a showplace'' for such projects.
   Curtis said Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary has ``worked hard to gain
greater acceptance'' of joint implementation projects. The first round of
seven projects were selected in February 1995.
   The projects announced last week are: a forestry project in Costa Rica
involving U.S. partner Newton Treviso Corp.; a geothermal project in
Nicaragua, with Trans-Pacific Geothermal Corp.; a biomass generation
project in Honduras with U.S. participants Nations Energy, a subsidiary of
Tucson Electric, the Edison Electric Institute and Add on Energy 1; a
hydroelectric project in Costa Rica with New World Power Corp.; a windfarm
in Costa Rica with New World Power Corp.; a wind facility in Costa Rica
with Power Systems Inc. and EnergyWorks; a forest restoration project in
Costa Rica with the Nature Conservancy; and a fugitive gas capture project
in Russia with Oregon State University, Sustainable Development Technology
Corp., Sealweld Corp., and EPA.

SECRETARY O'LEARY'S CHIEF ADVISER ON RUSSIA, ROBERT BERLS JR., left DOE

SECRETARY O'LEARY'S CHIEF ADVISER ON RUSSIA, ROBERT BERLS JR., left DOE
Dec. 29 to join the department's former deputy secretary, William White, in
a new international company based in Houston. Berls will be the vice
president of corporate development for Howe-Baker Development Co., which
White formed after he left DOE earlier this year, the department announced
last week.
   No replacement for Berls at DOE has been named, a spokesman said. Berls
coordinated DOE programs involving Russia and other former Soviet states.
In his new position, he will concentrate on business opportunities in those
nations, he said.
   Howe-Baker Development is a limited-liability company that specializes
in marketing and project development for small-scale refining and
processing units built by Howe-Baker Engineers, Inc., Tyler, Texas, DOE
said.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS CLAIM DOE IS `BACKSLIDING' ON REPROCESSING POLICY

By:
David Kramer

Environmental groups charged last week that DOE is ``backsliding'' on a
20-year-old U.S. commitment to end reprocessing activities by pursuing a
plan to use chemical separations ``canyons'' to treat spent fuel and other
nuclear materials at the Savannah River Site.
   Led by the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, which
released a report on the issue Thursday, the groups claimed that by
generating additional waste, reprocessing will cause more environmental
problems than it solves and will undermine the credibility of U.S. efforts
to convince other nations such as North Korea, India and Russia to end
their reprocessing activities.
   ``How is the United States going to convince these countries and others
to halt reprocessing if we're plunging into it ourselves?'' asked IEER
researcher Noah Sachs, author of the report: ``Risky Relapse into
Reprocessing.'' Though DOE has pledged not to use the plutonium or highly
enriched uranium separated through reprocessing for weapons, other
countries will not be able to verify this, he noted.
   ``It creates a kind of reprocessing double standard,'' Sachs said,
adding that other nations will be unable to verify DOE's pledge not to use
the fissile materials that are separated through reprocessing for nuclear
weapons.
   After exhaustive environmental analyses, DOE has elected to reprocess
much of the spent fuel and solutions containing fissile materials at SRS to
stabilize the material for long-term storage. Moreover, a number of
influential Republican lawmakers, notably Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.,
chairman of the Armed Services Committee, have consistently advocated
reprocessing as a solution to spent fuel management problems at SRS and
other DOE sites.
   But the environmental groups, which also included the Energy Research
Foundation, an SRS watchdog organization, and Snake River Alliance, a
grass-roots group located near the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory,
argued that DOE should instead place the spent fuel into dry storage until
technical solutions to problems facing long-term disposition have been
resolved.
   Beatrice Brailsford, executive director of SRA, also criticized DOE's
continuing support at INEL of experimental technology known as
electrometallurgical processing, calling it a ``back door flirtation with
reprocessing.'' The technology ``poses a peril to nonproliferation goals,''
she said, and also fails to respond to any clear need.
   ``DOE's bad interim storage policy is being driven by a bad long-term
storage policy,'' said Arjun Makhijani, IEER president. DOE should start
from scratch in its efforts to find a high-level waste repository, he said,
and abandon its trouble-plagued effort to characterize the Yucca Mountain,
Nev., site. In so doing, the agency ought to resurrect its deep seabed
disposal research program, which was terminated when Congress ordered the
agency to focus all its efforts on the Nevada site.
   DOE need not rush into a repository, Makhijani maintained, since interim
dry storage for a period of up to 100 years would permit the decay of most
of the highly radioactive and heat-generating fission products such as
strontium and cesium. That in turn would eliminate many of the technical
design concerns that face the Yucca Mountain project.
   IEER also rejected reprocessing advocates' contention that DOE spent
fuel, which unlike commercial fuel is in metal form, must be stabilized
prior to its permanent storage. Alternatives to reprocessing could be
developed over the next few decades, or special containers might be
designed specifically for the DOE material, they said.
   ``There is no spent fuel management option that is without risks,''
Sachs said, ``but DOE's own data show that the storage option poses far
fewer risks than reprocessing.''
   According to Sachs, DOE data show that the radiation dose to the
population surrounding SRS during reprocessing activities would be four to
five million times higher than from continued storage of the material
there. DOE estimates in the report indicate an exposure level of 15
person-rem per year via air pathways, and a further 2.2 person-rem per year
via water pathways to the population within 50 miles of SRS.
   DOE's current reprocessing plans will add three million gallons of
high-level liquid radioactive wastes to the tanks at SRS, increasing the
total volume of those wastes by around 10%, according to the report.

REPORT BY SRS CONTRACTOR APPEARS TO ADVOCATE REPROCESSING AT SITE

By:
David Kramer

The operator of DOE's Savannah River Site prepared a report for a local
congressman that suggests reprocessing of spent commercial nuclear fuel at
the facility to prepare the material for permanent disposal.
   An internal report by Westinghouse Savannah River Co., the management
and operating contractor, said reprocessing the nation's commercial spent
fuel for disposal in a permanent repository could be accomplished at SRS
for as much as ``several billion dollars'' less than it will cost to
dispose of it directly in a repository, as the current plan calls for.
Moreover, Westinghouse said, reprocessing would ``increase the technical
assuredness of the spent fuel management program, and potentially could
yield recyclable uranium feedstock.''
   The report, which was prepared in August, was made public by the Energy
Research Foundation, an SRS watchdog environmental group, last week. A DOE
spokesman at Savannah River said the report was requested by Rep. Charles
Norwood, R-Ga., and took about a week to complete. He added that DOE had
not sought the study.
   ERF Director Brian Costner expressed outrage at the report, calling its
cost estimates ``absolutely absurd.'' They do not include any expenses to
upgrade the two 40-year-old reprocessing ``canyons,'' he said. Further, he
added, they fail to account for additional wastes that would be generated
by reprocessing and do not consider ongoing problems with SRS' Defense
Waste Processing Facility, which would be used to vitrify the high-level
wastes that are separated from the spent fuel.
   According to the report, DOE could dispose of the current inventory of
commercial spent nuclear fuel for about $8 billion, including the estimated
repository fees for the canisters that contain the vitrified waste. While a
final repository would still be required, the cost and technical
uncertainty would be cut significantly by the 20-fold volume reduction that
would be achieved through reprocessing, as well as the conversion of the
waste to a single form containing only short-lived non-fissile fission
products, the paper said.
   Reprocessing opponents point out that the procedure would result in a
huge volume of low-level waste that Westinghouse proposes to form into a
concrete-like ``saltstone'' for storage. The report argues that the
saltstone is ``a non-hazardous, non-regulated waste form which has no
environmental impact,'' a characterization disputed by Costner.
   Costner also charged that SRS was ``toying with U.S. nonproliferation
policy,'' and ``trying to redefine reprocessing without a clear open
debate.''
   The Clinton administration generally opposes reprocessing on the grounds
that it encourages proliferation of nuclear weapons-usable materials. DOE,
however, plans to resume reprocessing activities at SRS in order to
stabilize some of its spent fuel and other nuclear materials left over from
weapons production (related story above).
   The administration has been especially adamant in opposing the
reprocessing of commercial spent fuel, however, and has never considered it
as an alternative for civilian spent fuel disposal.
   However, a number of Republican congressmen and senators, particularly
those in the region surrounding SRS, have advocated reprocessing. Norwood
and Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
are two such proponents.
   The report said SRS has documented that the canyons can operate until
2015 ``with normal capital upgrades.'' SRS, said the report, ``has the
immediate capability to assist the DOE and the nuclear power industry in
addressing the nation's spent fuel crisis by beginning the immediate
receipt of commercial spent fuels.''
   The DOE spokesman said Norwood's request came after Senate Energy
Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, proposed using SRS and DOE's
Hanford Site in Washington as interim storage facilities for commercial
spent fuel. ``We get a lot of requests from our congressional delegation
and we respond to them,'' he said.
   The Westinghouse report, however, was well-detailed and appeared to be
written with a pro-reprocessing slant. For example, it indicates that the
direct disposal route for spent fuel is fraught with technical
uncertainties, commenting, ``this uncertainty has not provided the public
with any confidence that the DOE can successfully manage spent fuels.'' By
contrast, the reprocessing route ``offers a technologically proven,
cost-effective solution to the spent fuel disposal problem,'' it said.
   The report also examined the feasibility of reprocessing spent fuel from
other DOE facilities -- the Hanford Site and the Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory. It concluded that the cost of disposing of DOE's Naval Reactor
spent fuels could be cut by nearly two-thirds, to $5 billion, compared to
$14 billion for direct disposal. The cost of disposing of DOE's stainless
steel and zirconium-clad spent fuels could be cut to around $700 million,
from $1.2 billion, it said.

SAIC EXECUTIVE ALM NOMINATED AS DOE'S ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP CHIEF

In an action widely expected for months, the White House Dec. 27 nominated
Science Applications International Corp.'s Alvin Alm to take over DOE's
environmental cleanup program. Alm, a director and senior vice president
for SAIC's Environmental Business Area, will replace Thomas Grumbly as
assistant secretary for environmental management at DOE if he is confirmed
by the Senate.
   President Clinton Dec. 20 nominated Grumbly as DOE under secretary, the
third most senior position at the agency (IE/FL, 25 Dec, 10).
   Prior to joining SAIC in 1989, Alm was the chief executive of Alliance
Technologies Corp. and served as the board chairman and chief executive of
Thermal Analytical Corp. From 1983 to 1985 he was the deputy administrator
of the Environmental Protection Agency.
   In 1970, ALM served as the first staff director of the newly created
White House Council on Environmental Quality and in 1973 became EPA's
assistant administrator for planning and management, a position with
responsibilities for strategic planning, budgeting, policy and internal
management.
   If confirmed by the Senate, Alm's new position would mark his second
stint at DOE. In 1977, he joined the agency as assistant secretary for
policy and evaluation. Alm now serves as co-chairman of DOE's Environmental
Management Advisory Board and is on the board of the Energy and
Environmental Policy Institute and the Environmental Export Council.
   Alm will inherit from Grumbly a roughly $6-billion-a-year program that
has come under increasing pressure in Congress and the administration to
reduce its costs. Although it largely escaped deep spending cuts proposed
by the House last year, the program is certain to come under still more
scrutiny from congressional budget cutters this year. In addition, Energy
Secretary Hazel O'Leary is moving ahead with a promise she made early last
year to reduce the program's costs by more than $4 billion over the next
five years.
   Just how quickly the Senate will act on the two nominations is an open
question. An aide to the Senate Energy Committee last week said Grumbly has
a good reputation among committee members and should have little difficulty
winning confirmation. Less is known about Alm, he said, but there is little
reason to believe he will prove controversial.
   Although Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, prefers to move
quickly on nominations, the aide said it could be several months before the
committee and Senate take action, largely because the Senate has been
operating for several weeks without a full contingent and may do so for
sometime longer.

EM DIVISION TELLS CONGRESS OF ITS PLAN FOR COPING WITH BUDGET CUTS

DOE's Environmental Management division last week told lawmakers how it
plans to allocate the $476 million in cuts Congress made to its FY-96
budget.
   In letters sent to about 100 senators and representatives, Thomas
Grumbly, the assistant secretary for environmental management, said EM has
slashed its headquarters costs by 37%, to $222 million, in response to
directives contained in the conference report accompanying the FY-96 Energy
and Water Development Appropriations Act. It also used prior-year balances
as much as possible, also as directed by the appropriators, and accelerated
cleanup activities to reduce long-term costs both at the Fernald
Environmental Management Project and the Rocky Flats Environmental
Technology Site, he added.
   Congress appropriated 7.3% less than DOE's amended budget request for EM
this year -- providing just over $6 billion. But lawmakers earmarked $135
million in EM expenditures, further reducing the amount available to
allocate among the DOE cleanup sites.
   ``The bottom line for most sites is that in virtually all cases the
field office budget reductions were less than 10 percent,'' Grumbly wrote
in the Jan. 2 letters. Reductions at each site were made after consulting
with and reaching agreement among all the field managers, he said.
   Grumbly said the actual percentage cuts among all the sites varied for
three reasons. First, the level of prior-year balances varied among the
sites, and reducing these was one of the goals set by Congress. Second, DOE
sought to maximize the level of compliance at the sites with regulatory and
other requirements, which also vary. And finally, the congressional
earmarks required the department to add funding to certain sites for
specific projects.
   A direct comparison between FY-95 and FY-96 funding levels for each site
as a percentage of the EM budget is not possible due to the increase in
responsibilities of the EM progam in FY-96, he said. These new duties
include site management at the Savannah River Site, Mound Plant and
Pinellas Plant, as well as additional nuclear materials management
activities across the complex.
   Among DOE's largest cleanup operations, funding for the Hanford Site is
being cut 6.3%, to $1.3 billion, while the Savannah River Site's budget
will decline 8.6%, to $1.2 billion. Funding for the Oak Ridge Reservation
will fall by 9.2%, to $782 million, while that for Rocky Flats will decline
by 8.7%, to $573 million. The Ohio Field Office, which funds cleanup both
at Fernald and Mound, will decline by 3.5%, to $509 million, and Idaho
National Engineering Laboratory's budget will fall by 7.2%, to $471
million.
   Funding for Albuquerque Operations, which funds cleanup projects at two
DOE weapons labs as well as operation of the Waste Isolation Pilot Project,
will decline 4.5%, to $608 million, according to the letter.
   In a letter to Washington Republican Sen. Slade Gorton, Grumbly warned
that additional job reductions beyond the 4,800 that have already been
announced by DOE for the Hanford Site are likely. He added that a precise
tally of cuts was not possible at this time.
   Congressional earmarks included a $50 million increase to the budget
request for EM's technology development program to provide funds to be
managed by DOE's Office of Energy Research to develop a research program
that uses the national laboratories and universities; a $25 supplement to
the technology development account for electrometallurgical r&d; $59
million for the maintenance of funding levels at the Morgantown Energy
Technology Center to fund contracts associated with private sector
involvement in developing improved technologies that address needs of the
technology development ``focus areas'' and crosscutting programs; and $1
million in additional funds to the Western Environment Technology Office in
Butte, Mont., to meet EM's commitment to maintain funding level required to
accomplish previously initiated activities.

A SWAP OF WASTE OIL FROM TVA TO DOE SAVED TAXPAYERS $100,000, according to

A SWAP OF WASTE OIL FROM TVA TO DOE SAVED TAXPAYERS $100,000, according to
DOE. While trying to dispose of 75,000 gallons of mineral oil that was
slightly contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls, officials at the
Tennessee Valley Authority found that DOE could use the material at its Oak
Ridge K-25 Site.
   The oil is now being used as a first step in cleaning out three large
storage tanks that previously held liquids containing much higher levels of
PCBs. Flushing the 22,500-gallon tanks with oil is a standard initial step
in removing PCBs from the tank walls.
   According to Vince Adams, the DOE manager of the site's Toxic Substance
Control Act Incinerator, where the storage tanks are located, the
department would have purchased commercial fuel oil, at a cost of about
$80,000, to do the job, if not for TVA's offer. TVA estimates it saved
$20,000 in disposal costs by finding a user for it.
   The oil eventually will be burned in the incinerator, which was built in
part to destroy PCB-contaminated liquid wastes.

ALJ SAYS GREAT PLAINS COAL-GAS SETTLEMENTS UNFAIR TO RATEPAYERS

Controversy over the Great Plains coal-gasification project, which has
haunted Ferc virtually since it was first approved in 1979, lingers on.
After Administrative Law Judge Michel Levant refused to approve the terms
of settlements negotiated by pipelines to resolve years of litigation, the
plant's owner warned last week that, if unchanged, Levant's decision could
close down the synthetic gas facility.
   Four pipelines that signed 25-year, high-cost contracts to buy the
plant's output thought they had finally resolved their problems when in
early 1994 they negotiated deals with Dakota Gasification Co. to lower the
price they must pay. But in a Dec. 29 initial decision, Levant pointed to
``an abundance of post-settlement evidence'' confirming his view that the
settlements ``depart from the carefully crafted balance'' achieved in
Ferc's 1981 ruling, opinion 119, and do so ``at a grossly disproportionate
cost to ratepayers.''
   But in a statement, Dakota Gasification Vice President Kent Janssen said
Levant's decision would breach the original deal among pipelines,
ratepayers and DOE. ``Pricing language in the gas purchase agreements was
drafted by the ratepayers themselves,'' he said. ``Judge Levant's decision
would allow them to break that deal. That simply isn't right.''
   Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.,
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. and ANR Pipeline Co. had asked the
commission to endorse their deals with Dakota Gasification and DOE, the
previous owner of the plant, and rule that the resulting costs are eligible
for full recovery under terms of order 636. The commission subsequently
severed Natural from the proceeding because of a settlement between the
pipeline and its customers. Ferc set the case for hearing in October 1994,
instructing the ALJ to keep in mind the commission's cost-passthrough
commitment to the pipelines and its vow to ratepayers that costs would be
market-based (IF, 17 Oct '94, 13).
   The settlements committed the pipelines to pay a total of $504 million
in demand charges over seven years. The gas price would be pegged to the
spot price at Ventura, Iowa, as reported in published indexes.
   To begin with, Levant chided the pipelines for failing to confer with
either the commission or their customers during negotiations. It is
``incomprehensible that the pipelines made no effort to consult with the
commission'' about their disputes with Dakota Gasification, which spawned
extensive litigation. And ``it is even more remarkable that even though the
ratepayers would be expected to pay the costs of any settlement agreement,
the pipelines made no effort to bring them into the settlement
negotiations,'' said the decision (RP93-100, et al.).
   What's more, the pipelines apparently did not conduct ``any meaningful
studies or comparative analyses to evaluate the resultant costs and
benefits . . . to ratepayers'' under the original agreements and the
settlements. The ``thrust'' of the pipelines' argument in support of the
settlements ``was that they compared favorably with potential litigation
outcomes,'' Levant continued. But he characterized the pipelines'
litigation scenarios as ``highly speculative.''
   The bottom line is that the settlements ``do not reflect a reasonable
compromise,'' said the judge. There is ``simply no evidence in the record .
 . . which supports the imposition upon ratepayers of an obligation to pay
$504 million in demand charges in seven years,'' he said, noting that
ratepayers already had paid about $490 million in above-market gas costs
over the past decade to support demonstration of the coal-gasification
technology.
   Levant suggested that in weighing their options, the pipelines should
have paid more attention to their other high-cost gas supply contracts,
which ``served to elevate the price'' of synthetic natural gas purchased
from Dakota Gasification under terms of the original pricing formula. At
the time of the settlements, these contracts were being reformed, leading
to a natural decline in the SNG price. The option of continuing to buy
under the original agreements, ``with necessary and appropriate
modifications by the commission'' to reflect the restructured pipeline
services market, ``yields a more favorable result for the pipelines and,
more importantly, for the ratepayers who must ultimately pay the bill,''
Levant concluded.
   At one time speculative, the coal-gasification technology developed at
the Great Plains project is now ``a great success,'' Levant asserted. He
said ``there has been no persuasive showing in the record that continued
operations of the plant cannot be sustained'' under modified versions of
the original agreements approved in opinion 119.
   Levant also held that an appropriate ``top-of-the-market'' pricing
formula for the period commencing May 1, 1993, would be based on an average
of Gulf Coast spot-price indexes plus a 5% premium. Testimony during the
hearing by a ratepayer witness ``recognizes a reasonable premium for SNG in
tracking the natural-gas market, which is supported by [a] survey of
LDCs,'' said the decision.
   The formula endorsed by Levant would have produced a 1995 average price
of around $1.65/MMBtu, using figures from Inside F.E.R.C.'s Gas Market
Report. In his statement, Janssen said that Dakota Gasification's cost of
production currently is $2.60/MMBtu, ``and the pricing Judge Levant
suggests comes nowhere near covering costs. For the judge to suggest
[Dakota Gasification] can survive with that price is ludicrous.''
   Levant ruled that the pipelines' purchase obligations should be limited
to the original total of 137,500 MMBtu/day, rather than the settlements'
153,520 MMBtu/day. Even though the contract-demand language in the original
agreements is pegged to the total output of the plant, which has since
increased, Dakota Gasification ``has made no showing to justify unlimited
expansion of the original contract obligations for the purchase of SNG by
the pipelines or the ratepayers,'' the judge said. Excess volumes produced
at the plant can be made available for sale by Dakota Gasification ``at
competitive market prices or for production of the more lucrative
byproducts and co-products.''
   Dakota Gasification said the plant's average production since 1988 has
been 157,000 Mcf/day.
   Finally, the rate charged by Dakota Gasification for transporting gas
from the plant to an interconnection with Northern Border Pipeline Co. at
Hebron, N.D., should be 5.5 cents/MMBtu, rather than the 22 cents/MMBtu
proposed by the plant owner, Levant said. According to an estimate by Ferc
staff, Dakota Gasification already has collected some $46 million in
transportation revenue, which has ``fully compensated'' the company for
transportation ``for the entire [25-year] life of the project,'' the
decision said.
   If the decision is upheld, the pipelines would have to refund to
customers all amounts above the price and volume specified in the order
since May 1, 1993. Dakota Gasification, which vowed to file exceptions to
Levant's decision within 30 days, noted that the commission has promised to
act in the case by the end of 1996.

GAS PRICES TO CONSUMERS FELL MORE THAN WELLHEAD PRICES over the past 10

GAS PRICES TO CONSUMERS FELL MORE THAN WELLHEAD PRICES over the past 10
years, according to a study released last week by the American Gas Assn.
While some classes of customers enjoyed greater savings than others, all
customers experienced lower prices in real terms during the decade ending
in 1994, said AGA President Michael Baly.
   ``Over this 10-year period, the actual average price of natural gas to
all customers declined by 93 cents/Mcf,'' while wellhead prices fell by 78
cents/Mcf, he said. Industrial customers saw the largest savings, averaging
57%, ``as regulators and utilities moved toward reflecting the actual cost
of service for a customer and toward eliminating the historic subsidization
of residential prices by large-volume users,'' the report said. During the
same period, residential gas prices fell by 24%, after having increased by
111% the previous decade.
   A recent Energy Information Administration study covering the period
1988 through 1994 found that wellhead prices and the cost of transmission
to the city-gate fell roughly equally but that distribution markups did not
decline (IF, 4 Dec, 3).
   Seeking to deflect criticism that the distribution and transmission
sectors of the industry have not done enough to reduce costs, Baly said
that costs in these sectors declined by 33% during the 10 years. ``The
pricing structures of the different sectors of the industry are not the
same and they respond differently and at different times to the commodity,
labor and capital markets, and to regulatory impediments,'' he said. Baly
added that ``this makes it unlikely that prices in each sector would move
identically and simultaneously on a percentage basis.''
   Offering a cost-cutting example, the report noted that the gas utility
industry served almost 58-million gas meters in 1994 with about 187,000
employees, compared with 49-million meters and 221,000 employees 10 years
earlier. ``That's the equivalent of serving 18% more customers with 15%
fewer employees, a personnel reduction of 34,000 across the utility
industry,'' said the report.
   The bottom line ``still is that all gas customers are benefiting from
increased competition and lower gas prices,'' Baly concluded. Gas demand
increased by nearly 30% during the 10-year study period, the report noted.
And to extend this trend in the face of growing competition from a
restructured electric industry, ``all sectors of the industry will continue
working to reduce costs, to enhance product value to gas consumers and to
resist attempts to fragment and weaken the industry.''
   For more information on the study, ``The Effects of Competition on
Natural Gas Prices,'' contact AGA at (703) 841-8400.

WILLIAMS STEPS IN AS FULL KERN RIVER OWNER AFTER FTC KNOCKS QUESTAR OUT

   It all happened rather quickly. After the Federal Trade Commission late
last month moved to block Questar Pipeline Co.'s $225 million plan to
acquire Tenneco Energy's 50% ownership interest in Kern River Gas
Transmission Co., the parties agreed not to challenge the decision and
Tenneco Energy promptly picked another suitor, reaching an agreement at a
lesser price with The Williams Cos. Inc. on Dec. 31.
   Since it already owns the other half of Kern River, Williams would be
the sole owner of the Wyoming-to-California pipeline. The $205 million sale
is subject to FTC approval, which is where Questar ran into problems in its
bid.
   Reasoning that Questar's planned ownership in Kern River would translate
into a monopoly on gas service in the Salt Lake City area, the FTC on Dec.
27 said it would bar the move. Questar owns Utah distributor Mountain Fuel
Supply Co. and the FTC was concerned that if it also held a portion of Kern
River, the pipeline would not bypass Mountain Fuel to serve customers
directly, an FTC official noted.
   If the purchase had gone through, ``Questar could discourage Kern River
from competing in the area,'' according to William Baer, director of the
FTC's Bureau of Competition. ``Kern River was soliciting business in the
Salt Lake City area,'' and ``diminishing that threat of lateral bypass to
Kern River was our concern with the acquisition,'' Baer told Inside
F.E.R.C. Industrial customers should view the ruling as a positive
development, he asserted.
   Following the decision, Questar decided to forgo the purchase rather
than challenge the FTC. Litigation ``wasn't in our best interest,'' a
Questar spokesman said. ``Our interest was access to Nevada and California
markets,'' he said. ``We are disappointed'' with the FTC ruling ``and don't
agree with it,'' Tenneco Energy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steve
Chesebro' said in a statement. But the company decided to contact potential
buyers rather than fight the FTC, Chesebro' said.
   The Questar spokesman noted that Questar and Tenneco Energy had filed
documents with the FTC and conducted extensive discussions with FTC staff
to demonstrate that the purchase would not reduce competition for gas
transportation services in Utah. ``We said both Ferc and state regulators
would pay attention to whether Mountain Fuel was acting in the customers'
best interest,'' the spokesman explained.
   Mountain Fuel does receive gas from Kern River to serve customers near
Salt Lake City, but ``Kern River has never sold gas in the area,'' he
added. The Questar spokesman suggested that the FTC was ``using an obsolete
view of the pipeline industry'' that didn't include the open-access
principles of order 636. He noted that Questar had planned to have its Kern
River functions separate from its other operations to mitigate any
antitrust concerns.
   According to a release from the FTC, the acquisition would
``substantially reduce competition'' between Questar and Kern River, which
would lead to ``higher prices and other anticompetitive effects.'' The fact
that Questar owns Mountain Fuel ``enhanced its market power,'' Baer noted.
He conceded that ``this is a somewhat unusual antitrust case'' because Kern
River is a competitive presence in the area ``even though they have zero
percent of the market.''
   And ``we weren't convinced'' that Ferc regulation of Kern River would
alleviate that market power, Baer said. What's more, Questar has said that
it faces competition from Kern River because Kern River has expressed its
intentions to expand to directly serve the Salt Lake City area, and the
planned purchase was like ``buying an insurance policy'' against that
competition, Baer asserted.
   As for the sale to Williams, Tenneco Energy said the companies executed
a binding $205 million agreement on the last day of the year. ``We
concluded it was in Tenneco's best interest to avoid the time and expense
involved in restarting the bidding process and go ahead and finalize the
terms of the transaction before year-end,'' Chesebro' said. The timing of
the sale also allows Tenneco Energy to retain about $10 million of net
operating income accrued since September, when the company first announced
the sale of its share of the system to Questar.
   Williams is pretty confident that it will not run into trouble getting
FTC approval of its Kern River purchase, according to corporate spokesman
Jim Gipson. ``I don't think they will have more of a problem with us owning
100% of Kern River than they have with us owning 50%,'' he said. Williams
subsidiary Northwest Pipeline Corp., which transports gas from some of the
same Rocky Mountain production areas as Kern River, ``serves the Pacific
Northwest,'' a market area completely different from Kern River's, he
noted.
   If the purchase is approved by the FTC, Gipson observed, ``we will
wholly own five interstate pipelines'' -- Williams Natural Gas Co.,
Northwest, Texas Gas Transmission Corp., Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line
Corp. and Kern River.
   Williams has had the right since last May to make an offer to purchase
Tenneco Energy's half interest in Kern River. While the company ``has not
commented'' on whether or not it ever did, ``don't assume that we didn't
make an offer,'' Gipson advised.
   In September, when Questar agreed to pay $225 million for Tenneco
Energy's portion of Kern River (IF, 18 Sept, 8), Williams declined a chance
to match that offer. But Keith Bailey, chairman, president and CEO of
Williams, noted last week that lower interest rates, tax issues and other
factors combined to change the economics of the acquisition since then.
``We have always said that we were interested in [wholly] owning Kern River
under the right set of circumstances,'' Gipson pointed out.
   Lower interest rates are key to the deal's viability, Gipson said.
Williams and Tenneco Energy began working last year to refinance Kern
River's debt ``to take advantage of today's [low] interest rates,'' he
stated, and that will help Williams finance its acquisition. When Kern
River was built in 1991, Williams and Tenneco Energy each paid $150 million
of the $1 billion cost, and the remaining $700 million was borrowed from
various banks at an average interest rate just over 9%, Gipson recalled.
Williams plans to refinance the remaining $643 million of debt at an
interest rate that probably will be 2% lower, he said.
   Tax issues also came into play in the structuring of the deal, Gipson
continued. While Questar's transaction with Tenneco Energy was to be a $225
million stock purchase, Williams is buying Tenneco Energy's 50% partnership
interest, rather than stock. For Williams, purchasing a partnership
interest rather than stock is preferable for tax reasons, he said.
   The stock-purchase structure of Tenneco Energy's deal with Questar was
one factor that discouraged Williams from matching Questar's offer when it
had the chance, according to Gipson. ``The deal we had to pass on last
fall, the only opportunity we had was to match [Questar's offer], in
structure and price,'' he said. ``Every company is different, every
company's financial profile is different. So what is a great deal for one
company is not necessarily a great deal for another.''
   Gipson also noted that Williams is paying $20 million less than Questar
had agreed to pay. Williams is paying $26 million more, however, for
Tenneco Energy's 50% partnership interest than its own 50% Kern River
interest carries in Williams' own books. Williams has appreciated its
initial $150 million investment in Kern River to $179 million, Gipson
said.
   As 100% owner of Kern River, Williams ``could monetize the 50%'' it
bought from Tenneco Energy ``to an investor or to the public,'' Gipson
pointed out. ``We're not necessarily announcing that we are going to do
that,'' but the option would be there, he said.
   If the purchase goes through, Williams will stop reporting income from
Kern River as equity income and start reporting it as operating income. The
pipeline has been contributing $32 million to $33 million per year to
Williams' income; that would double once Williams gets Tenneco Energy's
share, and Williams also expects savings from increased operating
efficiencies. Williams always has operated Kern River, but Tenneco Energy
has handled the administrative side. After the acquisition, administrative
functions ``will be folded into our Salt Lake City offices,'' where an
administrative staff already is in place for Northwest. While it will add a
few people to the current Salt Lake City staff, Williams expects Kern River
to achieve ``annual savings of $2 million to $3 million'' as a result of
``not having two corporate entities involved'' in running it, Gipson said.
   Following the purchase announcement, Moody's Investors Service Inc.
placed the securities ratings of Williams and its subsidiaries on review
for possible downgrade. Moody's said its review ``will examine the
likelihood of a deterioration in Williams' financial position as a result
of the acquisition. Although Williams' 100% ownership of Kern River may
provide operational benefits, the acquisition is expected to add a
substantial amount of debt to Williams' balance sheet.''

WITH CONDITIONS, FERC SIGNS OFF ON PARKING SERVICES FOR THREE PIPES

   The added flexibility afforded customers is reason enough to approve the
plans of three pipelines to provide hub services in the form of parking and
loaning, Ferc reasoned in a series of orders issued late last month.
Proposals by Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co., Mojave Pipeline Co. and
Iroquois Gas Transmission System all were approved with an effective date
of Jan. 1, subject to conditions. Ferc said technical conferences should be
held to address concerns about the Mojave and Panhandle plans.
   The pipelines generally proposed to establish programs that would allow
customers to park gas at specified receipt points for withdrawal at a later
date.
   Iroquois shippers were concerned that existing operations would be
hindered as the pipeline used excess line pack to provide the services (IF,
18 Dec, 6). But Ferc dismissed that notion in its Dec. 29 order (RP96-63).
Because Iroquois has assigned its parking and loaning service a lower
priority than firm and interruptible transportation, ``there is no basis
upon which to find, at this time, that the PAL service will adversely
impact Iroquois' provision of firm service,'' Ferc said. The commission
also found Iroquois' rates to be just and reasonable. It concluded that
Iroquois shippers will ``reap significant benefits in the form of added
flexibility'' as a result of the PAL service.
   For Mojave, which also sought to establish an imbalance trading service,
shippers had several questions about how the pipeline would implement its
hub proposal (RP96-67). With no storage facilities of its own, how would
Mojave's use of line pack relate to the creation of imbalances? shippers
wondered (IF, 25 Dec, 15).
   Ferc ordered a technical conference for parties to address ``their
operational concerns regarding how Mojave will offer hub services and how
the hub services may impact other existing services and tariff
provisions.'' Ferc said customers should be able to explore Mojave's
treatment of hub service revenues and its implementation of the new
imbalance trading provisions at the conference.
   ``Likewise, the technical conference can provide a more informed basis
to determine if Mojave's maximum `first-day' and `subsequent-day' rates are
too high, as suggested by several parties,'' Ferc said. The commission
noted that it's difficult to compare rate design among the pipelines
offering hub services because of the variety of those services and pipeline
systems. It's unclear what resources Mojave will use in rendering the
services, Ferc added. It accepted Mojave's hub plan subject to refund and
the outcome of the technical conference.
   The commission called for a technical conference in the Panhandle
proceeding as well, primarily to explore Panhandle's failure to allocate
any costs to its parking service and the possibility of a revenue-crediting
mechanism. Late last month, Panhandle sought to allay shippers' fears
regarding its parking service, insisting that it would meet its firm and
interruptible requirements before any parking transactions take place (IF,
25 Dec, 14).
   The commission's Dec. 29 ruling (RP96-51) found that the operational
flexibility, supply management and financial management options associated
with the parking service should be in place as soon as possible during the
current winter season. Despite those benefits, however, Ferc said Panhandle
needs to provide more support for the parking service rates. The commission
said ``the convening of a technical conference is the best method to
resolve the issues raised by the parties.''
   The order noted that Panhandle did not show a derivation for its
proposed minimum daily rate of 0.5 cents/Dt. ``Panhandle will be required
to file work papers and supporting materials which support and demonstrate
such derivations,'' Ferc said. It approved the parking service subject to
refund and the outcome of the technical conference.

SERVICE REVISIONS GIVING TENNESSEE SHIPPERS MORE FLEXIBILITY took effect

SERVICE REVISIONS GIVING TENNESSEE SHIPPERS MORE FLEXIBILITY took effect
Jan. 1 as scheduled, the pipeline reported to Ferc last week. The changes
were part of a settlement (RP95-396) on Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.'s
much-maligned services. In approving the deal Nov. 1, Ferc ordered the
status report on Tennessee's follow-through (IF, 30 Oct, 3).
   Certain firm transporters now can bump interruptible shippers. In
addition, flexible nomination and scheduling provisions have been
implemented, and provisions on unauthorized overruns and maximum allowed
volumes give customers additional swing rights, Tennessee said. The
pipeline's production-area pooling, or supply aggregation (SA) service,
also is now in place. Some 102 customers that scheduled nearly 3.9-million
Dt/day used the modified services and SA service for Jan. 1 business,
according to the pipeline.
   Tennessee said a pilot group of shippers successfully tested TENN-SPEED
3, an upgrade of its computer software, from Nov. 16 through Dec. 8. All
customers should be using the new software by April, it said. Also
beginning in April, new ``swing on storage'' and cash-out services will be
available.

FERC'S NOI SHOULD NOT HOLD UP OFFSHORE EXPLORATION PLANS, Shell Gas

FERC'S NOI SHOULD NOT HOLD UP OFFSHORE EXPLORATION PLANS, Shell Gas
Pipeline Co. told the commission in two different petitions last month. In
its notice of inquiry (RM96-5) on systems operating in the Outer
Continental Shelf, Ferc vowed to consider changes to its regulations in a
prompt manner because there are several projects pending at the commission
(IF, 4 Dec, 1).
   Shell Gas late last month said Ferc should not wait for the outcome of
the NOI before issuing an order on its proposed Mississippi Canyon
Gathering System (IF, 16 Oct, 11). Delaying a decision on its request for a
nonjurisdictional declaration ``would have exactly the effect that the
commission says it wants to avoid: impeding and distorting developmental
activities on the OCS,'' Shell Gas said. If the commission cannot issue an
order by Feb. 1, it could issue an interim ruling, declaring the
Mississippi Canyon facilities to be nonjurisdictional, subject to the
outcome of its inquiry, the pipeline suggested in the Dec. 22 filing
(CP96-9).
   Meanwhile, in a new request for a declaratory order (CP96-113), Shell
Gas submitted plans to develop the Garden Banks Gathering System in the
OCS. While Shell Gas commended Ferc for its effort to clarify its
regulations regarding the OCS, delaying the planned construction of the
Garden Banks system risks disruption of oil and gas production from
critical areas, it asserted.
   The Garden Banks system would consist of a 50-mile, 30-inch-diameter
pipeline extending from the planned Enchilada platform in the Garden Banks
area to a new platform to be set in the South Marsh area. It would
interconnect with the existing facilities of Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line
Corp., ANR Pipeline Co. and the Blue Water header system. Shell Gas and
Amerada Hess Corp., which has committed to a 20% ownership in the system,
expect multiple lateral lines to deliver gas into the 30-inch line because
there is insufficient pipeline capacity to handle expected production
volumes in the area. Shell Offshore Inc.'s production from the Auger Field
was shut in during portions of 1995 because of a lack of pipeline outlets,
Shell Gas claimed.
   Asserting that the Garden Banks system meets Ferc's primary-function
test, Shell Gas noted that Ferc found a similar ``spine and laterals
network'' of the Viosca Knoll Gathering System to be nonjurisdictional.
Although the planned 30-inch pipe would be the widest line classified by
Ferc as a gathering facility, the large diameter is necessary to handle all
of the expected production from the area, Shell Gas said. It added that
``collecting gas from multiple sources into a single 30-inch pipeline
`spine' is a more economically efficient way to handle the large volumes of
anticipated production from the Garden Banks area than numerous piecemeal
gathering lines from individual blocks to individual pipeline
connections.''
   The system would have a capacity of 1.2 Bcf/day, according to the
application. Shell Gas asked Ferc to declare the facilities
nonjurisdictional by March 1 so production can begin to flow by April 1,
1997. If the system is not ready for service by then, ``Shell and other
Garden Banks producers will be subject to significant financial losses,''
it told Ferc.

LATE TO THE GAME, EASTERN SHORE FILES INITIAL RESTRUCTURING PLAN

   Two years after most pipelines were forced to jump through the hoops of
order 636, Eastern Shore Natural Gas Co. submitted its initial
restructuring plan. ``We've been in a unique situation,'' said Michael
McMasters, director of planning for Eastern Shore, explaining that the
pipeline at the time of industrywide restructuring was not required to join
the ranks of open-access pipelines. All that is about to change, however:
the pipeline agreed in a settlement to go open access and filed its plan
(CP96-128) Dec. 29.
   ``There really wasn't any great demand'' for open-access status on the
pipeline ``by any of the customers or any public agency'' when order 636
was issued, an attorney for Eastern Shore added. ``We felt customers were
pleased with the service and the rates'' from the pipeline, the attorney
noted. Since Eastern Shore was not an open-access pipeline, order 636 did
not apply, according to the attorney.
   More recently, however, at least one customer ``has expressed some
interest'' in unbundled service, ``and we thought the time was right'' to
offer it, the attorney said. McMasters added that in the pipeline's last
rate case, ``we agreed to open our system'' as part of a settlement.
   Eastern Shore's system runs from interconnects with Columbia Gas
Transmission Corp. and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. in southern
Pennsylvania through Maryland and Delaware, it noted. It serves four local
distribution companies and 12 direct sales customers, with a majority of
its throughput going to its parent, Chesapeake Utilities Corp., McMasters
explained.
   Operation of its bundled city-gate sales service requires a significant
amount of effort in coordinating receipts, McMasters said. It is severely
constrained in operational flexibility because peak-day throughput is about
four times the system's linepack, the pipeline noted in the application.
``The advent of open-access service on the Eastern Shore system, with new
rights and obligations being bestowed on both Eastern Shore and its
customers, may engender a great deal of uncertainty about the future
operations of its system,'' Eastern Shore told Ferc.
   Rather than retain upstream capacity, as some pipelines did, it proposed
to have customers exercise nominating and scheduling rights on Transco and
Columbia through Eastern Shore. ``We will act as an agent in scheduling
their gas'' on the upstream pipelines in order to preserve operational
control of its system, McMasters said.
   Another critical element to its operations is a certificate request
(CP96-97) filed last month (IF, 11 Dec, 14) to increase capacity on its
system and deal with the declining pressure on its Hockessin line, where it
takes gas from Transco, McMasters added. Noting that Eastern Shore proposed
an effective date for restructured services of no later than Nov. 1,
McMasters said ``we can't open our system until we get the other
certificate.''
   The pipeline intends to file a rate case implementing straight
fixed-variable rate design on May 1, the application noted. The timing of
the rate case is also tied to the certificate request in order to include
the cost of the additional facilities, according to McMasters. The switch
to SFV and other elements should produce an average rate hike of 13.56%, he
said.
   Eastern Shore proposed to implement a capacity-release program, with
bidding on a ``very simple'' electronic bulletin board that is still being
developed. ``Eastern Shore is proceeding very deliberately in the
development and implementation of its EBB in order to avoid unnecessary
costs which would ultimately be borne by its customers,'' it said. Any
transition costs resulting from restructuring will be collected consistent
with order 636, Eastern Shore said.
   In offering unbundled firm transportation, Eastern Shore said customers
will receive entitlements equivalent to their current bundled service
rights. It is offering firm and interruptible transportation, and a
no-notice transportation service. Eastern Shore said the cost-based sales
service requirement for small customers under order 636-A is not applicable
because it has traditionally not offered sales under a small customer rate
schedule.
   It sought a limited waiver from the commission's marketing-affiliate
standards. ``Due to its small size, Eastern Shore has historically shared
facilities and employees with Chesapeake,'' resulting in lower costs and
lower rates for its customers, the pipeline noted. And since the
distributor sells off-system gas, it is likely considered a marketing
affiliate of the pipeline. Eastern Shore said that it has separated the
operations of its pipeline from those of its marketing affiliate to the
maximum extent possible, however, with only two shared employees.

CONSOLIDATION OF GAS COMPANIES WILL CONTINUE IN '96, ANALYSTS PREDICT

By:
Cathy Landry

   The gas industry has not seen the last of consolidation, as
ever-increasing competition this year will force companies to seek greater
efficiencies and cost-cutting measures, according to industry analysts.
   ``I would say . . . the merger-and-acquisition activity will rebuild in
1996 as companies continue to transform into what I describe as energy
conglomerates,'' explained John Olson, first vice president of securities
research for Merrill Lynch. Even though there were some sizable
acquisitions in 1995, Olson characterized the 1995 merger-and-acquisition
activity as ``fairly quiet.''
   The really big year for consolidation, he said, was 1994, when Panhandle
Eastern Corp. merged with Associated Natural Gas Corp. in a transaction
valued at about $800 million, and The Williams Cos. Inc. announced a $3
billion acquisition of Transco Energy Co. (IF, 26 Dec. '94, 1). Olson
believes 1996 will rival 1994's activity level.
   Two consolidation trends should emerge, Olson predicted. First, the big
integrated energy companies -- ``the Williamses, Panhandles, Coastals,
Enrons, Sonats of the world -- will be looking very hard at both U.S. and
foreign acquisitions.'' Second, ``you will also see electric utilities
looking very hard at both pure [distribution companies] and integrated
natural-gas companies.''
   Ralph Pellecchia, a gas analyst and senior director at Fitch Investors
Service Inc., predicted that companies will continue to position themselves
to deal with greater competition. Because of increasing head-to-head
competition in a number of markets, Pellecchia suspects there will be even
more ``partnering up'' in 1996. He said producers and marketers will
continue to team up, as will producers and marketers with distributors. In
addition, he said more gas and electric companies will become partners in
the coming year. And he thinks there is the potential for gas distributors
and telecommunications companies to match up.
   Capacity turnback will remain one of the major issues in the gas
industry this year, Pellecchia predicted, with pipelines serving California
particularly hard hit. And the turnback issue will ``heat up'' in the
Midwest and in other areas of the country as contracts begin to expire and
pipeline customers move toward shorter-term commitments, he said.
   Gregg Anderson, an analyst with Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co., agreed
that merger-and-acquisition activity will continue next year. ``I think
1996 will be characterized by continuing consolidation and cost-cutting,''
he said.
   Anderson, who specializes in exploration-and-production companies,
expects there to be more, smaller transactions in 1996 than the eye-popping
megadeals in late 1994. ``I think there are fewer and fewer large companies
out there that have placed all their bets on long-term gas prices.'' He
noted, however, that ``there are a fair number of midsize companies that
are still being hurt by the volatility of gas prices.''
   Duff & Phelps recently lowered its outlook for gas prices over the next
five years. The rating group expects annual-average gas prices between
$1.80 and $2/Mcf, down somewhat from its previous projection of $2/Mcf
flat. If prices in fact do deteriorate, e&p companies will be forced to
continue to cut costs, Anderson said.

AGA ANNOUNCED ITS SUPPORT OF THE D'AMATO BILL TO REPEAL PUHCA, saying that

AGA ANNOUNCED ITS SUPPORT OF THE D'AMATO BILL TO REPEAL PUHCA, saying that
introduction of the measure ``is an important first step toward eliminating
an outdated statute that unnecessarily inhibits competition and has become
redundant in light of other, more effective reform implemented in the last
60 years.'' The American Gas Assn. board last month adopted a resolution
calling for repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act (IF, 11 Dec,
12), just weeks into the term of the group's new chairman, George Davidson
Jr., who also is chairman and chief executive officer of Consolidated
Natural Gas Co., one of five AGA members regulated under the act.
   In a Jan. 3 letter to Sen. Alphonse D'Amato, the New York Republican who
chairs the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, AGA
President Michael Baly offered the group's explicit support for ``repeal of
PUHCA as called for in your bill.'' Under the measure (S. 1317), Ferc and
the states would be provided access to utility books and records, and they
would have jurisdiction over rate treatment of costs associated with
affiliate transactions (IF, 16 Oct, 1).
   Baly further indicated that AGA ``recognizes that PUHCA relates to
corporate organization and financing, and repeal appropriately can be
considered apart from other legislation on a stand-alone basis.'' Key
energy lawmakers in the House plan to address PUHCA reform as part of
restructuring of the electric industry, but Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, has stated firm
opposition to linking reform of the act with comprehensive reform of the
industry.
   ``Your bill . . . recognizes the anachronistic and burdensome regulatory
system in place to enforce the provisions of PUHCA,'' Baly's letter
continued. ``That the Securities and Exchange Commission has endorsed
repeal of the statute makes this an opportune time for Congress to act on
this issue. We urge you to hold hearings on your bill in a timely fashion
so that the momentum building on this will not be lost,'' he urged.

UNION ELECTRIC, CIPS WANT STOCKHOLDERS TO GET CUT OF MERGER SAVINGS

   In seeking approval of their proposed merger, Union Electric Co. and
Central Illinois Public Service Co. have asked Ferc to authorize a ``shared
savings plan'' that would enable stockholders to recover direct merger
costs and then split the remaining savings with ratepayers.
   The two utilities, which would be operating utility subsidiaries of the
registered holding company Ameren Corp., also need Ferc approval of
agreements that would implement their plan to transfer Union Electric's
retail electric and gas service in Illinois to CIPS. The Dec. 22 merger
application (EC96-7) asked for expeditious approval without a hearing,
asserting that ``there can be no dispute that the transaction will produce
substantial cost savings, will expand wholesale market opportunities for
the majority of regional market participants and, therefore, will be
consistent with the public interest.''
   When Union Electric and CIPS announced their merger in August (IF, 21
Aug, 1), they projected cost savings of $570 million over 10 years. The
application raised that to $590 million -- $196 million in corporate and
operations labor, $204 million in corporate and administrative programs,
$69 million in nonfuel purchasing economies, $84 million in electric
production and $37 million in gas supply.
   The cost-savings projection was developed in the initial stages of
merger negotiations and thus is ``not an ex post facto attempt to justify a
decision to merge'' but rather has been ``an important element of the
applicant's internal merger planning,'' the application said. The
projection also doesn't include programs to reduce costs and increase
efficiencies that the two utilities have undertaken on their own, apart
from the merger, it added.
   Subtracted from the savings are costs of $19 million to accomplish the
merger, $22 million in transaction costs and a $232 million merger premium,
yielding net savings in the first 10 years of $317 million.
   The utilities said that in addition to the $590 million saved in the
first 10 years, the merger would produce another $970 million in savings in
the second 10-year period and almost $1.4 billion in the third 10-year
period. To allow stockholders to share in the savings, the companies would
amortize the $273 million in merger costs over 10 years in a way that
ensures there are net savings in each year. They then would split net
savings equally between shareholders and customers. The utilities asked
Ferc to find that the sharing plan ``is consistent with appropriate
regulatory accounting treatment.''
   CIPS serves 317,000 retail electric customers and 166,000 gas customers
in central and southern Illinois. Union Electric serves 1.06-million
electric customers and 100,000 gas customers in Missouri and 64,000
electric customers and 18,000 gas customers in Illinois. CIPS would acquire
Union Electric's electric and gas distribution systems in Illinois, but not
its generation or transmission facilities in that state.
   After the merger, under a ``system support agreement'' CIPS would buy
capacity and energy from Union Electric to serve the transferred electric
customers in Illinois. The agreement is intended to avoid cost-shifting
between state jurisdictions and, in short, ``to maintain the status quo,
with the generation and transmission system planned and installed to serve
these customers continuing to serve them,'' the application said. Without
the agreement, ``the transfer of the Illinois customers would not be
possible, and the resulting economies would be lost,'' it added, calling
the agreement ``central'' to the merger plan.
   On a related point, the applicants asked Ferc to authorize the transfer
of the current balance in an Illinois account for Union Electric's nuclear
decommissioning costs to a Ferc subaccount, since Union Electric no longer
would have retail service in Illinois.
   Union Electric and CIPS also plan to operate their combined generation
and transmission facilities as a single control area under a ``joint
dispatch agreement.'' The single control area would interface with 28 other
utilities, which ``should enhance interchange purchase and sales
activities,'' they said. ``The result should be reduced costs'' for the two
utilities.
   On wholesale electric issues, the two utilities said they have complied
with Ferc's merger policy by filing open-access transmission tariffs that
conform to the pro forma tariffs in the commission's proposed transmission
rule (RM95-8).
   Contracts for wholesale requirements customers would remain in place,
and any inclusion of merger costs in rates after current contracts expire
would be negotiated with those customers, the application said. Moreover,
Union Electric and CIPS committed to an open season in which any wholesale
requirements customer could terminate its contract by giving 90 days'
notice if either utility files for a rate increase. That commitment would
apply to the first five years after the merger is consummated. And any
wholesale customer whose contract expires prior to the fifth anniversary
would be allowed to extend its contract to the fifth anniversary date.
   Bulk-power market participants would benefit because the two utilities
would transmit at a single-system, postage-stamp rate, which would expand
rather than diminish bulk-power supply options, the utilities asserted. The
application included testimony by Rodney Frame of National Economic
Research Associates Inc., who concluded that ``there is no likelihood of an
adverse effect on competition in any of the relevant markets,'' the
application said.
   The merger was approved on Dec. 20 by shareholders of both Union
Electric and CIPSCO Inc., the parent of CIPS. The companies have filed for
approval from the Missouri Public Service Commission and the Illinois
Commerce Commission and said they will seek authorization from the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission as well as
federal antitrust clearance.

THE STATE OF THE ELECTRIC INDUSTRY ``IS NOT AT ALL BAD''

THE STATE OF THE ELECTRIC INDUSTRY ``IS NOT AT ALL BAD,'' according to
Edison Electric Institute President Thomas Kuhn. In a luncheon discussion
in Washington last week sponsored by the Washington International Energy
Group, Kuhn touted the 3.4% growth in electricity demand last year and
asserted that steady merger activity is ``changing the face of our
industry'' for the better.
   At Ferc, ``the mega-NOPR is on target and the commissioners seem to be
in sync'' for achieving the goal of issuing a final rule on open-access
transmission and stranded-cost recovery this spring, he said. Commenting on
a subject that is drawing increased attention both as part of and apart
from the debate over the proposed rule, Kuhn said EEI is ``very much open
to the concept of developing the specifics'' of what would constitute an
independent system operator for transmission service.
   ``But before you say that the ISO should be applicable to every place .
 . . you have to look at a lot of those specifics'' to make sure that it
accommodates unique characteristics of the affected market, he continued.
The industry remains concerned that one-size-fits-all solutions may be
inappropriate in the context of the restructuring, Kuhn added.
   Looking at what is going on in Congress, the EEI president maintained
that there is no need for legislation ``to address retail competition that
tells the state what they have to do.'' Asserting that ``states are
vigorously looking at competition,'' Kuhn said they do not need a federal
mandate to require retail wheeling. Asked if EEI is concerned that without
a legislative directive there will develop a hodgepodge of programs state
by state, Kuhn replied that markets are developing on a regional basis.
``Issues are being addressed'' and solutions are being examined regionally,
he asserted. ``You are just seeing the marketplace work.''
   Kuhn declined to speculate on what action Congress might ultimately
take, or when it might happen. House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas
Bliley Jr., R-Va., and energy and power subcommittee Chairman Dan Schaefer,
R-Colo., have talked about comprehensive legislation to restructure the
industry, possibly involving federal pre-emption on the issue of retail
wheeling (IF, 27 Nov, 1), but ``they haven't really come up with any
particular proposals at this time,'' he observed.
   Commenting on specific state developments, Kuhn said the investor-owned
utility industry was very pleased that the California Public Utilities
Commission's Dec. 20 restructuring order would permit 100% recovery of
stranded costs. And on that subject, he slammed the Electricity Consumers
Resource Council's proposal to give utilities the chance to recover no more
than 50% of such costs, suggesting that it in fact would allow very little
cost recovery (see story on page 1).

NEPCO CAN'T CHARGE A FIRM RATE FOR CURTAILABLE TRANSMISSION even though the

NEPCO CAN'T CHARGE A FIRM RATE FOR CURTAILABLE TRANSMISSION even though the
customer has agreed to the rate, the commission says. In a Dec. 29 order
(ER96-200, et al.), Ferc directed New England Power Co. to file within 30
days lower rates for the service that is subject to curtailment.
   NEPCO transmits power from the New York Power Authority to various
Massachusetts municipal customers, whose agent is Massachusetts Municipal
Wholesale Electric Co. In a renegotiation last fall, MMWEC agreed to pay a
firm rate for transmission of 35,456 Kw. Of that amount, 17,730 Kw will be
transmitted on a firm basis and the remaining 17,726 Kw will have a
curtailment priority higher than some nonfirm transmission but lower than
the firm service that NEPCO provides to itself and other firm customers.
   Ferc declared itself unpersuaded by NEPCO's arguments that MMWEC agreed
to pay the firm rate for the whole amount and that the utility wasn't
obligated to offer any firm service at all. ``For the firm service that it
will provide, NEPCO should be compensated. However, for the other service
it will provide, i.e., for the less-than-firm service it will provide,
NEPCO is not thereby entitled to an excessive rate,'' the commission said.

ELCON OFFERS STRANDED-COST RECOVERY PLAN; NO THANKS, SAYS EEI CHIEF

By:
Craig S. Cano

   Asserting that it's time to drop the posturing by utilities that seek
100% stranded-cost recovery and customers that argue for no recovery, the
Electricity Consumers Resource Council with some trepidation last week
proposed a formula that would permit utilities to recover up to 50% of
costs associated with uneconomic assets. The decision to put a
stranded-cost proposal into play stemmed from a desire to ``kick this thing
along,'' said ELCON Executive Director John Anderson, despite lingering
concern that the proposal might be interpreted as a signal that industrial
customers are willing to negotiate an even higher recovery figure.
   At a Wednesday press briefing to release ELCON's ``Road Map for the
Transition'' to a fully competitive market, the group's Director of
Technical Affairs John Hughes noted that uneconomic assets are ``very
clearly defined'' by the document. ``We are restricting what we want to put
on the table'' in the first place, he said. The result is that what ELCON
calls 50% recovery may indeed be much less than half in the eyes of
utilities.
   But the investor-owned utility industry trade group is not prepared to
budge from its insistence on the right to seek full cost recovery. ELCON's
complex formula for calculating and allocating stranded costs is ``designed
to ensure that there would be very little, if any, cost recovery,'' said
Edison Electric Institute President Thomas Kuhn. Speaking at a Thursday
lunch sponsored by the Washington International Energy Group (see story on
page 10), Kuhn asserted that the proposal ignores the fact that Ferc and
many states, like California, believe a utility's right to seek full cost
recovery is in the public interest. ``We really think it is a road map full
of ruts and potholes,'' he added.
   Asked if he sees the ELCON proposal as a bargaining issue to which an
EEI counteroffer will be made, Kuhn said that ``we already have come up
with our own proposal. We are sticking with it.'' EEI supports Ferc's
proposal to allow utilities to seek full recovery, he said, adding, ``I
don't see a bargaining chip here at all.'' Furthermore, ``I don't think
[the ELCON proposal] is going to be adopted by anybody,'' Kuhn said.
   The road map identified certain costs that would not be eligible for
recovery. For example, utilities could not recoup the above-market costs of
purchased-power agreements and/or fuel-supply contracts that the utility
has with affiliated companies. Also, ``no utility shall be allowed to seek
recovery of any costs associated with uneconomic assets that were committed
to subsequent to the enactment of the Energy Policy Act,'' said the road
map, which is a companion document to ELCON's ``Blueprint for Customer
Choice'' (IF, 9 Oct, 3).
   Utilities also would be required to engage in mitigation measures,
including writing off or writing down assets. Finally, during the
transition period to competitive markets, utilities would not be permitted
to earn a return on any uneconomic asset.
   Costs that could be recovered as uneconomic assets would include those
from purchased-power agreements and/or fuel-supply contracts with
nonaffiliates that exceed a market-clearing price; properly allocated
overhead expenditures associated with the uneconomic assets; some costs
associated with the deferred recovery of certain investments or
expenditures as a result of regulatory decisions; and the rate base value
of uneconomic generating assets in excess of their fair market value.
   However, stranded costs for generating assets would be reduced by two
factors. First, utilities would deduct from the calculation the
differential between fair market value and any generation assets below that
value. Second, the uneconomic asset costs would be offset by deferred
accounts that ``constitute outstanding utility obligations to their
ratepayers and are owed to their ratepayers,'' ELCON said.
   Having defined the eligible costs, the proposal then identified a
five-step process for recovering them. Step one would be to determine the
exact amount of the uneconomic assets through either a regulatory
proceeding or the utility's voluntary divestiture of the assets as a means
of determining their market value, which Anderson described as ``the last
great rate case or divest.''
   In step two, the state commission would determine a shareholder/customer
sharing mechanism. First, the utility would be required to commit to
mitigate costs to the ``maximum extent possible'' or the state could set a
``minimum mitigation threshold'' designating a level of expected
mitigation. The nonmitigable costs would be split between the utility and
customers based on a formula that would allow the company to recover no
more than 50% and could give even less based on the imposition of what
ELCON called a ``responsibility factor.'' That factor, to be developed by
each state commission, would reflect: the portion of the utility's
portfolio of uneconomic assets that were due to management discretion and
those that were due to government mandates; the utility's mitigation of the
mitigable costs; and the ``quality of the utility's management at the time
the uneconomic assets were incurred.''
   Essentially, an extremely well-managed and efficient utility that
``aggressively opposed'' any government mandate -- e.g., New York's 6 cents
avoided-cost law -- that created the uneconomic asset would get to recover
the full 50%. Conversely, a poorly run utility that did not fight such
government mandates could be denied recovery of any costs, ELCON said.
   In the rest of the process, step three would involve allocation of
recoverable costs to each customer class ``on a pro-rata basis using
cost-causation principles''; step four would be to determine a set recovery
period of three to five years; and step five would involve a true-up
mechanism to annually re-evaluate the level of the recoverable costs.
   That is an ``absolutely ludicrous way to go about things,'' Kuhn
commented. And in a prepared response, EEI said the proposal ``sets up a
regulatory nightmare, where utilities will be involved in proceedings for
years, arguing every point of legitimate stranded-cost recovery and
relitigating prudence, already determined by state commissions, with
ELCON's members.''
   EEI further asserted that the road map ``suffers from the same fatal
flaws'' that the trade group saw in the blueprint. ``It is an attempt to
advance ELCON's goal of imposing a one-size-fits-all `federal structure' on
the U.S. electric system which will deliver any benefits of restructuring
primarily to its members at the expense of everyone else.''
   Anderson revealed ELCON's intent to issue the road map at the National
Assn. of Regulatory Utility Commissioners' annual meeting, where he came
under sharp criticism from state regulators for the blueprint's lack of
detail about transition issues (IF, 20 Nov, 15). As he did at that time,
Anderson last week stressed that the blueprint was a ``vision'' document
meant to describe where the electric business should end up and was never
intended to address the transition period. The road map should ``dispel the
uncertainty of not knowing'' how to get to full competition, Hughes added.
   Stranded cost is just one part of the road map. Overall, it envisions
the transition as a three-year process to end on a designated day. Halfway
through the transition, customers would be allowed to choose their new
power supplier.
   Looking at market power, ELCON asserted that while customer choice ``is
a powerful weapon, . . . there must also be full enforcement of laws and
regulations to protect consumers against anticompetitive practices and
antitrust violations.'' Market entry is another check on market power, so
``no undue prohibitions should exist to entry in any market segment such as
generation, grid operation, ancillary services, transmission, local
distribution, merchant or customer service,'' it said.
   ELCON embraced the concept of operationally unbundling generation,
transmission, distribution and merchant functions into separate corporate
entities. That's the approach put forth by the Dept. of Justice in its
comments on Ferc's notice of proposed rulemaking on open-access
transmission (RM95-8). The road map also detailed the pricing and
regulation of interaffiliate transactions that would be necessary to ensure
success of operational unbundling. So while ELCON did not call for
mandatory divestiture, market pressures may bring about that result as
utilities find ``it isn't worth the hassle to stay under the regulatory
reach,'' Anderson said.
   But EEI countered that there is ``no need to `require' unbundling or to
encourage divestiture.'' The group said its NOPR comments demonstrated that
``the competitive market and the threat of competition will mitigate market
power. The establishment of [regional transmission groups], which EEI has
been advocating for years, can further help mitigate market power if some
feel it still exists.''
   On the issue of decontrol of generation, ELCON said that by the end of
the transition period all generation should be removed from rate base.
During the transition, and for some additional period if a fully
competitive market still has not emerged, the generating company would
continue to sell power to the affiliated or previously affiliated
distribution company under ``transition contracts at rates based on
embedded costs or other state-approved rates, terms and conditions,'' it
said.
   The transition contracts also would provide for ancillary and backup
services ``to all producers and consumers who had or achieved [Public
Utility Regulatory Policies Act] qualifying status by the beginning of the
transition period.'' ELCON said repeal or reform of PURPA should not begin
until those contracts are in place and enforceable.
   That provision was panned by the PURPA Reform Group, which comprises
utilities seeking to repeal the mandatory-purchase requirement of section
210. ``Although ELCON purports to support `real competition' in electric
power, it seems bent on using PURPA for every subsidy it can possibly
get,'' the group said in a statement. ``Utilities would be denied recovery
of prudently incurred costs associated with uneconomic assets committed to
after passage of the Energy Policy Act -- and yet they would be required to
continue buying PURPA power for the indefinite future.''
   Anticipating that criticism, Anderson asserted at the briefing that the
debate over repeal of section 210 is misdirected in its focus on the
mandatory-purchase requirement. He maintained that no new PURPA contracts
are being signed at above-market costs and that the utilities' problem is
with older high-cost contracts. What is lost in the debate, Anderson
continued, is that section 210 also requires that backup and ancillary
services be provided to QFs. And until QFs are assured of being able to
obtain those services on a competitive basis, Congress should not pull the
section 210 rug out from under them, he said.
   In other sections of the road map, ELCON supported private ownership of
transmission and distribution lines, independent system operations and
coordination, and a federal/state joint board on universal services.

ISOS, CAPACITY RELEASE, ALTERNATIVE RATES HIGHLIGHT FERC'S 1996 AGENDA

By:
Chris Newkumet

   The coming year at Ferc should be eventful indeed with the commission
planning to make major progress on a series of initiatives spanning its
gas, electric and hydropower responsibilities. But the big enchilada
clearly is the open-access transmission rule, Chair Elizabeth Moler
indicated last week, vowing that a final rule will be out sometime this
spring. And a critical element of the rule may well involve independent
system operators, a concept that has caught the commission's attention to
the extent that it is planning a Jan. 24 public conference to further
explore the idea.
   In an interview with Inside F.E.R.C. last Thursday, Moler also vowed
that this year will bring: guidelines for reforming power pools to ensure
nondiscriminatory operation; a new merger policy that accommodates the
changing nature of the electric industry; substantial progress in
developing alternative pipeline rate structures and guidelines for
incentive rates; formalized information and business practice standards for
the pipeline sector; and possible revisions to the commission's
hydropower-relicensing regulations.
   What's more, Moler revealed that the commission is quickly narrowing the
field of potential changes to the capacity-release program designed to make
such transactions ``easier and more equitable,'' with final revisions
expected well before the end of the year. Still near the intractable end of
the spectrum of Ferc issues, however, is capacity turnback; Moler allowed
that no one has hit upon a ready solution to the growing dilemma, with the
commission and the industry continuing to feel their way.
   The highest-profile generic proceeding at the commission, the
open-access transmission notice of proposed rulemaking (RM95-8), likely
will cross the finish line ahead of all others. ``We're beginning very
serious staff work and commissioner work'' on the final rule, Moler said,
characterizing the recent holiday break as the ``seventh-inning stretch''
in the mega-NOPR game.
   Part of that work will examine how ISOs may fit into the final rule,
Moler noted, asserting that the concept has ``great potential'' in the
scheme of things to come. With three major power pools telling Ferc that
they plan to install ISOs, and the California Public Utilities Commission
including the concept in its restructuring plan, it was not hard for Ferc
to notice that ``the industry seems willing to embrace them,'' the chair
said.
   ``The issue before us now is how do we evaluate ISOs,'' Moler continued.
``What are the essential elements and operating characteristics of an ISO?
How do we make sure that ISOs, if they are created, are nondiscriminatory?
Are ISOs necessary? Is functional unbundling enough, or do we have to
mandate ISOs?'' At the public conference, ``we will benefit from some
additional dialogue on the issues as we work toward a final rule,'' she
said.
   ISOs have potential not only in tight pools, Moler continued.
``Individual companies or two or three companies doing a strategic alliance
could set up an ISO,'' she suggested. What an ISO should not become is ``a
reincarnated pool where only the utilities can play . . . and have the
potential to discriminate in favor of their own generation.''
   The commission has learned much by watching the individual state
restructuring proceedings, the chair said, emphasizing the interface
between the new state programs and what Ferc has in mind for the wholesale
market. ``Individual states are beginning to make their decisions about the
nature of their local distribution and the way they want their utilities to
be structured,'' Moler observed. Open access at the interstate level
``clearly facilitates that . . . it is an essential prerequisite to further
progress at the state level.''
   For instance, the CPUC ``has decided to go to direct access,'' she noted
(IF, 25 Dec, 1). ``So be it, great. And in order to do that, they decided
they need a power pool . . . [and] a power exchange. And they recognized
the power pool and power exchange are jurisdictional to this commission. So
there is absolutely a link between'' wholesale and retail open access.
   Anything to report on the Ferc/state jurisdictional split? ``The ball
now is in our court to come out with a decision and define what we mean by
interstate transmission,'' Moler acknowledged. ``Obviously, we've been very
cognizant of the states' concerns about it, but it's our turn to issue a
final rule'' and go on from there.
   The rules of the game for power pools also are on Moler's mind. ``I
anticipate major work this year on reforming power pools,'' she revealed.
During the recent conference on the topic (IF, 11 Dec, 1), pool
representatives ``all said they are reforming themselves,'' the chair
related. Even so, Ferc will give the matter ``a lot of attention this
year'' under the mantle of its notice of inquiry on alternative
power-pooling institutions (RM94-20). ``What do power pools have to do in
terms of new membership and new structures and split-savings rates in order
to be nondiscriminatory?'' she wondered. ``That's a big deal,'' and Ferc
will issue new guidelines this year.
   A new policy for utility mergers will be next up, Moler said, noting
that ``lots of companies seeking to merge are very anxious about what we
will do. It's very topical.'' She observed that ``some of the measures of
benefits that we have used historically'' to judge mergers ``will not be
appropriate'' in an open-access environment. For instance, in recent cases
utilities have been required to provide open access as a merged entity.
``Well, everybody will be open'' after the final rule is issued, ``so we
have to re-examine our merger policy.''
   In the area of hydro relicensing, ``we're making slow but steady
progress'' in working through the mountain of applications filed at the end
of 1993, Moler said, noting that the commission is ``encouraging
settlements, and we have lots of settlement activity going on in several
basins.''
   Looking ahead to the next major flood of relicensing applications due at
the turn of the century, the chair seemed to agree with the National
Hydropower Assn. that Ferc's regulations could use some upgrading. The
commission recently invited comment on NHA's petition for rulemaking (IF, 6
Nov, 4), and Moler said she would ``love to be able to move the process
faster at less cost to the project sponsors. And if changing our regs is
the way to do that, I'm happy to figure out what to do.''
   On the gas agenda for 1996 is reforming the capacity-release program.
Asked whether it makes sense to develop strict rules that the market
routinely evades, Moler insisted that the best approach simply is to ``make
capacity release easier to do,'' a task that she vowed to complete this
year.
   And the existing price cap clearly will be on the table. ``I'm certainly
aware that the capacity-release issue has evolved in the past year,'' and
one new element involves state regulators, Moler explained. ``As more and
more states are looking at competitive markets behind the city-gate, the
nature of the capacity-release program is going to change.'' One of her
``personal hesitations in terms of releasing the price cap'' has revolved
around the existence of workable competition. And ``if there are major
changes at the state level where there is full competition behind the
city-gate, I won't be as worried about the price cap.''
   Commissioner James Hoecker's idea of setting an annual revenue cap (IF,
25 Dec, 1) ``is one of a variety of things we're looking at,'' said Moler,
acknowledging that she is moving closer to the realization that the price
cap can be lifted under certain circumstances. ``The industry's changing,
the market's changing,'' Moler reasoned.
   Moler also will be targeting the relationship between capacity-release
deals and interruptible transportation, which she characterized as out of
whack. ``I think we should have some parallel requirements'' for capacity
release and IT transportation, the chair suggested, asserting that
pipelines tend to ``make it really easy to do interruptible, because they
make the cash, but much more difficult to do capacity release, because they
don't.''
   This dichotomy ``appears to be trivial, but it's not,'' Moler said. ``It
absolutely tilts the playing field'' in favor of pipeline IT service. ``I
don't think we can pretend that pipelines will be indifferent'' to whether
capacity release or IT transactions are conducted on their systems, ``but I
hope to make it easier'' for shippers to release capacity.
   Moler also has great hope for the commission's ongoing study of
alternative rates, maintaining that progress in this area could answer
recurring complaints about pipelines' earnings. Wall Street analysts and
pipeline executives have argued time and again that rates of return on
equity simply are not high enough in large part due to the discounted cash
flow methodology used by the commission, but Moler sought to shift the
focus of the debate. ``My belief now is that what we really need to
concentrate on is finding mechanisms that will allow the pipelines rate
flexibility, particularly as they seek to serve new markets or as their
customers want to package things differently.'' Developing new criteria for
incentive rates is another high-priority item.
   ``If we can do a better job than we have to date in those two areas,''
pipelines ``will have an opportunity to earn a better return. And we're
working on that.'' While some in the industry still complain about the DCF
methodology, ``the people who have made the most impassioned pleas to me
recently on this issue'' have asked for ``a way that we can be more
flexible.''
   Pointing to the recourse rate plan floated by the Interstate Natural Gas
Assn. of America (IF, 13 Nov, 7), Moler explained that the idea is for a
pipeline to protect traditional, captive customers while having the rate
flexibility to offer attractive terms to new customers. Ferc is ``very
seriously looking at what we can do in that area,'' the chair related. She
cautioned, however, that there are ``lots of questions about what kinds of
flexibility you should give pipelines. . . . I don't want to give them rate
flexibility in a way that will result in deterioration of open-access
service.'' That having been said, ``it's difficult to figure out how to do
that,'' she admitted.
   Moler predicted that within the next year or so, the ``with-it''
pipelines, ``those that want to offer new services, offer new deals,'' will
be in a position to earn higher returns due to improvements in rate
flexibility and incentives. This approach ``is much more promising than
spending a great deal of time looking at the DCF methodology,'' Moler said,
adding that ``there is clearly more enthusiasm in the industry for
alternative ratemaking approaches than there is in fiddling around with ROR
analyses and the DCF methodology.''
   An issue that does not elicit such optimism from Moler is capacity
turnback. ``The commission and the industry seem to be feeling their way''
in this area, she acknowledged, noting that none of the major players in
the debate as yet has come up with ``a solution'' to the problem. ``The
best solution is growing the marketplace,'' she offered, while admitting
that certain markets where turnback is an acute problem, like Chicago and
California, show no signs of imminent growth. ``Where markets are not
growing, it's a very difficult issue.''
   Referring to the recent order involving Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of
America (IF, 16 Oct, 1), Moler noted that ``all we've been able to come up
with to date'' in terms of a potential solution ``is basically rate
flexibility. That's what the Natural order stands for -- rate flexibility
but don't zap your captive customers'' by shifting excess costs their way.
She conceded ``that is not a final solution in any way, shape or form. I
don't pretend it is.'' Natural responded that Ferc ``can't possibly think
this is enough,'' she related. But the pipeline and its customers are
busily pursuing a settlement, she said, suggesting that the long
give-and-take process may be the only way out for pipelines like Natural
and El Paso Natural Gas Co.
   And it could get worse, Moler allowed. Would the commission stand by and
watch a pipeline suffer severe financial hardship, even bankruptcy, due to
turnback costs? ``I certainly hope'' that doesn't happen. ``Anybody in this
position would hope not. But it could happen.''
   Ferc is feeling some financial pressure of its own these days, due to
budget authorization that orders a 20% reduction in oil-and-gas staff over
the next two years (IF, 20 Nov, 4), and Moler is none too pleased. ``I'm
not happy,'' she said of the budget cut. ``We went in with a voluntary and
very significant cut, and they cut us even further. No manager . . . would
be happy in those circumstances.'' But ``it's a fact of life'' now, and
``the fact that they gave us two years'' to make the cuts ``certainly makes
it easier to deal with.'' Through attrition and transfer of staff to the
electric program, Moler is hoping that ``we don't have to lay too many
people off'' as a result of the budget directive.

COMMENT DEADLINE EXTENDED

Ferc is beginning to feel the impact of the partial shutdown of the federal
government. Noting that a number of agencies closed due to the budget
impasse were unable to file comments on the draft environmental impact
statement (IF, 20 Nov, 13) for the open-access notice of proposed
rulemaking (RM95-8), the commission last week lifted the comment deadline.
``In order to accommodate this unusual circumstance, notice is hereby given
that an extension of time for the filing of comments by all parties on the
DEIS is granted for a reasonable period after the agencies have reopened.''
The comments had been due today (Monday); a new deadline will be set in a
future notice, Ferc said.

EQUITRANS AGREED TO BE PLACED AT RISK FOR ITS STORAGE EXPERIMENT involving

EQUITRANS AGREED TO BE PLACED AT RISK FOR ITS STORAGE EXPERIMENT involving
the injection of nitrogen to replace a certain amount of base gas at its
Shirley reservoir in West Virginia. Equitrans Inc. ``believes that this
project is important both for itself and for the industry and is willing to
assume the risks of the project to see it move forward,'' the pipeline said
in a Dec. 29 amendment to its application (CP95-565).
   One of the contested elements of Equitrans' certificate request was a
condition that if the project fails, the pipeline will be guaranteed
recovery of the net book value of the facility, along with a return on its
investment (IF, 31 July, 15). After another look at the risks and remedies
in case the nitrogen mixes with other gas to damage the facility, Equitrans
said it would bear all costs associated with such an event.
   However, the likelihood of that occurring is less than 1%, according to
Equitrans. Under a worst-case scenario, Equitrans said costs to restore the
storage field to normal operations would amount to $1.7 million. It added
that it would use the revenue generated from the sale of the withdrawn base
gas to fund the restoration efforts.
   Furthermore, Equitrans assured customers that the terms of all existing
storage contracts would be met regardless of any adverse effects resulting
from the project. ``This commitment is being made in order to render moot
the security-of-supply concerns'' expressed by customers and to limit the
number of issues to be addressed by Ferc, Equitrans said.
   The pipeline also specified how much base gas it intends to replace with
nitrogen. Although it plans to inject 300,000 Mcf of nitrogen, Equitrans
proposed to withdraw up to 400,000 Mcf of base gas to allow the pressure
within the reservoir to push the nitrogen away from working-gas parts of
the facility. The net reduction in base gas ``will ultimately reduce
Equitrans' storage rate base to the benefit of customers, while having
virtually no impact on storage operations,'' the pipeline said.

AVOCA'S CERTIFICATE AMENDMENTS WERE APPROVED WITH ONLY A FEW adjustments,

AVOCA'S CERTIFICATE AMENDMENTS WERE APPROVED WITH ONLY A FEW adjustments,
most of which involve environmental conditions. Sponsors of Avoca Natural
Gas Storage sought four changes in its certificate to operate the facility,
including installing a header that would allow connections with two
pipelines in addition to its approved link with Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.
(IF, 23 Oct, 15).
   Ferc's Dec. 29 order (CP94-161) approved the header, designed to
accommodate connections with CNG Transmission Corp. and National Fuel Gas
Supply Corp., along with the other three amendments.
   The commission dismissed the concerns of Rochester Gas & Electric Corp.,
which has unused storage and transportation capacity on CNG Transmission
and argued that a connection is not needed because of its unsubscribed
capacity. The commission said it is not approving an interconnect yet, but
is simply allowing the installation of the header. ``Rochester Gas should
intervene and raise its concerns when an application is filed to construct
the interconnect between Avoca and CNG,'' Ferc suggested.
   The order approved the use of electric compressor motors rather than the
gas-fired engines originally planned, noting the reduced emission and noise
levels. Ferc also found no problems with Avoca's switch to six caverns
instead of five, since there will be no change in the working-gas capacity
of 5 Bcf. Lastly, the commission approved Avoca's request to take water
directly from the Cohocton River to supplement its withdrawals of water
from the storage caverns.

PLEASE LET US FINISH CONSTRUCTING OUR FACILITIES, EGAN TOLD FERC in an

PLEASE LET US FINISH CONSTRUCTING OUR FACILITIES, EGAN TOLD FERC in an
emergency motion for clarification. Egan Hub Partners L.P. was in the
middle of construction under Ferc's prior-notice procedures when the
commission issued its order asserting jurisdiction over Egan's operations,
it explained in a motion (CP96-21) late last month.
   Although its storage facilities in Louisiana have been operating since
summer, Egan filed a prior-notice request in October to build 6.7 miles of
24-inch pipeline and related equipment to connect with Columbia Gulf
Transmission Co. The notice said that Egan would operate the facilities
under section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act, and construction began on
Dec. 4, Egan related.
   Then Ferc issued its order (PR95-11) finding Egan's interstate storage
facilities subject to its jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act and
directing Egan to seek NGA section 7 authority (IF, 18 Dec, 1). Egan halted
construction in order to seek clarification of Ferc's ruling.
   Even though Ferc said it should continue storage service using its rates
in effect, Egan asked Ferc to interpret the order to allow the section 311
construction to continue. ``Egan believes that the order was not intended
to penalize Egan or its customers for those actions initiated prior to
issuance of the order,'' it said. ``Justice requires either clarification
or a stay in order to allow Egan to complete construction of the
facilities,'' the company asserted. No environmental benefit would be
gained by delaying the construction, it added.
   And Ferc recently stayed its decision asserting jurisdiction over
pipeline systems run by Kansas Pipeline Operating Co. (IF, 18 Dec, 2) to
avoid potential hardship and inequity, Egan said in claiming that its
situation is almost identical to that of the Midwest pipeline systems.
   If Ferc does not grant the relief, ``customers will not receive the
service they expected during the winter heating season,'' Egan said,
enclosing affidavits from three customers that signed up for service
through the Columbia Gulf interconnect. With prompt approval from Ferc,
Egan said it could complete the facilities and initiate service for the
customers by Feb. 1.
   ``Without the requested authority, Egan, and ultimately its customers,
will incur additional and unnecessary costs,'' it said. Egan noted that it
is currently paying standby costs for contractors and equipment totaling
almost $17,000/day -- ``an amount which is significant for a company of
Egan's size.''

SHIPPERS CAN CHOOSE TO PAY KOCH GATEWAY DIRECTLY FOR FUEL USED to transport

SHIPPERS CAN CHOOSE TO PAY KOCH GATEWAY DIRECTLY FOR FUEL USED to transport
their gas now that the commission has approved the pipeline's
cash-reimbursement plan. Koch Gateway Pipeline Co. had offered to allow
customers to select the cash-reimbursement option once it posts a price for
such deals on its electronic bulletin board (IF, 11 Dec, 13), and the
commission late last month turned thumbs up on the proposal.
   In a Dec. 28 decision (RP96-58), Ferc dismissed arguments that the sale
of fuel gas should be made by a separate arm of the pipeline and comply
with the commission's affiliate standards. Noting that it has approved
similar tariffs for other pipelines, Ferc reasoned that the
cash-reimbursement option is analogous to imbalance cash-out programs. The
commission said Koch Gateway's plan ``is not a marketing service, but is an
extension of its transportation service, and it is not necessary for the
sale to be made by Koch Gateway's marketing affiliate.''
   Once a customer selects cash reimbursement, Koch Gateway will offer the
same deal to similarly situated shippers while retaining the right to deny
requests, according to the order. Rejecting protests that the tariff
provides Koch Gateway too much discretion in who would qualify for cash
reimbursement, Ferc said the pipeline needs some operational flexibility
for situations when it needs to have the fuel in-kind. ``We find that the
terms of the tariff and the commission's regulations afford customers
adequate protection against arbitrary action by Koch Gateway,'' Ferc said.
   Shippers will still have the option of reimbursing Koch Gateway by
supplying gas in-kind, the commission noted. It accepted the change with an
effective date of Jan. 1.

AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF ACTIVE NEGOTIATIONS IN THE EL PASO RATE CASE, ``there
just does not appear to be present the necessary give and take, at least at
this point,'' to produce a settlement anytime soon, the commission's head
administrative law judge commented late last month in appointing an ALJ to
commence a formal hearing.
   While rejecting El Paso Natural Gas Co.'s proposed exit fee to recover
costs of turned-back capacity last summer, the commission directed parties
to pursue a settlement of other elements of the rate case (RP95-363),
setting a Dec. 31 deadline. Parties recently offered differing views on the
progress of those negotiations (IF, 18 Dec, 7), and Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner
Jr. apparently agreed with the darker view held by Southern California
Edison Co., which earlier last month called on the commission to appoint a
hearing judge.
   The parties ``have now had some five months of active negotiations,
including unprecedented conferences before a settlement judge'' both in and
outside Washington, said the scheduling order. ``With the number of
conferences that have been held and the enormous effort that has been put
forth, everything that could have been said by the parties has been said
many times and everyone's desires have been fully considered,'' Wagner
observed. Even so, ``it does not now appear that a unanimous settlement or
even a unanimous partial settlement is possible.''
   Accordingly, the case should go to hearing ``on an expedited basis''
under the hand of ALJ Joseph Nacy. The order directs Nacy to issue an
initial decision within 18 months.
   And while ALJ David Harfeld was relieved of his duties as settlement
judge, ``there is no reason the parties cannot continue to meet among
themselves to try to work out their differences and dispose of this rather
difficult case through an agreed-upon settlement,'' Wagner observed. In
fact, the parties are scheduled to meet again in Washington Jan. 10-11.
   Separately, El Paso on Dec. 28 filed to place into effect as of Jan. 1 a
modified version of the June 30 rates accepted and suspended by the
commission last summer.

ANR IS DOUBLE-CHARGING FOR SERVICE TO A PLANT IN OKLAHOMA, Amoco Production

ANR IS DOUBLE-CHARGING FOR SERVICE TO A PLANT IN OKLAHOMA, Amoco Production
Co. asserted late last month. Based on the pipeline's misclassification of
its own facilities behind the Mooreland processing plant, ANR Pipeline Co.
is collecting both transportation and gathering charges, Amoco told the
commission.
   In its complaint (RP96-92), the producer asked Ferc to classify ANR's
facilities behind the plant as gathering and make the pipeline refund
transportation charges previously collected on plant fuel and shrinkage
volumes. ANR operates several compressor stations in the area, with some
attached to its transportation system and others connected to gathering
lines, Amoco related. ANR operates its Mooreland station, however, as both
a transportation and gathering facility, according to Amoco.
   The pipeline's intent is to create a way to charge both gathering and
transportation fees for gathering service, Amoco asserted. After applying
Ferc's modified primary-function test to ANR's Mooreland-area system, Amoco
said ``none of ANR's behind-the-plant facilities performs a transportation
service with respect to field production delivered to the inlet of the
Mooreland plant and are therefore improperly classified as transmission
facilities.''
   As operator of the Mooreland processing plant, Amoco explained that it
usually provides plant fuel and shrinkage volumes by sourcing gas upstream
of the plant. But ``ANR's classification of behind-the-plant facilities has
inhibited Amoco's ability to obtain upstream gas supplies because ANR
bundles together transportation and gathering rates on such gas,'' Amoco
said. So when ANR charges the Mooreland plant owners for downstream
transportation, it receives double charges on volumes of gas equivalent to
fuel and shrinkage, Amoco asserted.
   The producer noted that Ferc ordered Williams Natural Gas Co. to stop
charging both gathering and transportation rates on fuel and shrinkage
volumes in a similar case. The ANR proceeding deserves the same treatment,
Amoco said, asserting that Ferc should order refunds, with interest, on all
improper transportation charges collected since ANR unbundled its gathering
and transportation rates.

FERC WILL DETERMINE RATE TREATMENT FOR NORTHERN BORDER'S proposed

FERC WILL DETERMINE RATE TREATMENT FOR NORTHERN BORDER'S proposed
expansion/extension project in the pending certificate proceeding, it made
clear in a Dec. 29 rate order. Northern Border Pipeline Co. had filed pro
forma tariffs showing a change in its depreciation rate schedule that it
emphasized would be made only if the project is built.
   Competitor Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America had urged the commission
to reject the pro forma sheets (IF, 4 Dec, 15). But Ferc said it considers
the tariff sheets ``to have been provided for demonstration purposes only''
and neither accepted nor rejected them.
   The commission suspended the rate filing (RP96-45) until June 1 and said
a number of issues raised by shippers -- including Northern Border's
existing depreciation rates -- can be thrashed out in a hearing. But it
rejected up front two changes sought by Northern Border.
   First, Ferc said Northern Border can't drop its minimum revenue credit
for interruptible transportation. Under the pipeline's cost-of-service
tariff, firm shippers pay all of its costs and receive credits for
interruptible transportation. The minimum credit was put in place when
Northern Border began open-access transportation because the pipeline could
discount IT without bearing any economic consequences itself.
   ``This reasoning is equally applicable today and will remain so for as
long as Northern Border maintains this form of tariff,'' the commission
said, adding that the cost-of-service tariff ``gives Northern Border
advantages which other pipelines do not enjoy, their [straight
fixed-variable] rate design notwithstanding.'' Since other pipelines base
rates on projected costs and billing determinants, they face underrecovery
of their cost of service when they discount, the order noted.
   Second, Northern Border asked to eliminate a tariff requirement for a
triennial review of its equity rate of return. Again, though, Ferc cited
Northern Border's unusual cost-of-service rate structure. The three-year
review requirement has applied since the pipeline was built and ``was
considered an essential part of the regulatory bargain that was originally
accepted by Northern Border and still prevails,'' the order said. Northern
Border ``has not presented a basis for a departure'' from the policy, it
added.
   On another point, Ferc set for hearing Northern Border's request to
raise its allowance for charitable donations from $20,000 to $100,000.
Commissioner James Hoecker dissented on that issue, as he has in other rate
cases, saying he would ``summarily find that charitable contributions
should not be included in rates'' but nevertheless hopes Northern Border
``would continue charitable giving regardless of the rate treatment
permitted such costs.''

SPECIAL REPORT

If you had gas to sell in Louisiana for Jan. 1, 1996 likely is shaping up
to be a pretty good year. Jan. 1 index prices in Louisiana -- with a few
exceptions -- posted gains of $1.01 to $1.24/MMBtu over Dec. 1 index
levels. The exceptions were for Louisiana deliveries into Koch Gateway
Pipeline Co. (up 40 cents/MMBtu), Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America (down
2 cents/MMBtu) and Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. in West Louisiana (up
63 cents/MMBtu).
Sellers in Appalachia also found significantly higher index prices for Jan.
1 over Dec. 1: CNG Transmission Corp. was up $1.27/MMBtu and Columbia Gas
Transmission Corp., $1.20/MMBtu. Index prices on Mid-Continent pipelines
rose too (9 cents to 15 cents/MMBtu) but not by anywhere near as much.
   Indexes for pipelines in Texas, where longhaul capacity was limited,
ranged from minus 6 cents/MMBtu on Texas Eastern in East Texas to plus 8
cents/MMBtu in Florida Gas Transmission Co.'s zone 1. Indexes in the
Rockies were down 4 cents to 6 cents/MMBtu from Dec. 1. Permian Basin
indexes were up 15 cents and 18 cents/MMBtu, and the San Juan Basin index
rose a nickel.

SALP HISTORY REPORT

Note: NRC's SALP program was revised July 14, 1993 (NRC Management 
directive 8.6). NRC says that ``the final rating for each functional area
will be a composite rating of the performance based on a knowledgeable
balancing of the issues in a functional area and their safety significance.
Statistical or numerical balancing of data is inappropriate.'' With this
revision NRC has reduced the number of functional areas to four: plant
operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant support. This last area
includes activities such as radiological controls, emergency preparedness,
security, chemistry, and fire protection.

FOOTNOTES:
RPT - date report issued
ASSMT. PERIOD - assessment period
OPS - plant operations
RCON - radiological controls
MNT/SURV - maintenance, surveillance
EP - emergency preparedness
SEC - security
ENG/TS - engineering/technical support
SA - safety assessment/quality verification
PLSP - plant support
N - not rated

Category 1--Licensee attention and involvement have been properly focused
on safety and resulted in a superior level of safety performance. Licensee
programs and procedures have provided effective controls. The licensee's
self-assessment efforts have been effective in the identification of
emergent issues. Corrective actions are technically sound, comprehensive,
and thorough. Recurring problems are eliminated and resolution of issues is
timely. Root cause analyses are thorough.

Category 2--Licensee attention and involvement are normally well focused
and resulted in a good level of safety performance. Licensee programs and
procedures normally provide the necessary control of activities, but
deficiencies may exist. The licensee's self-assessments are normally good,
although issues may escape identification. Corrective actions are usually
effective, although some may not be complete. Root cause analyses are
normally thorough.

Category 3--Licensee attention and involvement have resulted in an
acceptable level of safety performance. However, licensee performance may
exhibit one or more of the following characteristics. Licensee programs and
procedures have not provided sufficient control of activities in important
areas. The licensee's self-assessment efforts may not occur until after a
potential problem becomes apparent. A clear understanding of the safety
implications of significant issues may not have been demonstrated. Numerous
minor issues combine to indicate that the licensee's corrective action is
not thorough. Root cause analyses do not probe enough, resulting in the
incomplete resolution of issues. Because the margin to unacceptable
performance in important aspects is small, increased NRC and licensee
attention is required.

Category N--Insufficient information exists to support an assessment of
licensee performance. These cases include instances in which a rating
cannot be developed because of insufficient licensee activity or
insufficient NRC inspection. The category is normally used for construction
phase reactors only.

INDUSTRY CBLA SAVINGS NEAR $600-MILLION MARK THROUGH MID-DECEMBER

By:
Kathleen Hart, Washington

   The nuclear utility industry estimates total savings of $590-million in
averted costs from NRC's cost-beneficial licensing action (CBLA) program
through mid-December, 1995.
   Industry interest in the agency's CBLA program was about the same in
1995 as during the previous year, with utilities submitting 116 CBLA
requests through December 14, 1995 compared with 123 requests in 1994,
according to NRC's semi-annual report on the program. But industry
estimates of the savings gained through licensing actions approved by the
NRC dropped significantly from the previous year.
   In 1995, NRC approved 115 CBLA requests for a total estimated savings of
$235-million. During 1994, the agency approved 52 CBLA requests, totalling
$335-million in expected savings over the remaining operating lifetimes of
the affected nuclear power plants. In 1993, the first year of the program,
utilities projected $20-million in savings from 33 approved CBLA requests.
   The declining value of the estimated savings ``likely reflects [the
fact] that the licensees initially submitted CBLA requests with the
greatest value,'' Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) Director
William Russell said in a December 28, 1995 memorandum to Executive
Director for Operations James Taylor. Russell suggested that future
amendment requests will continue to show declining savings.
   However, Russell said that the economic impact of the CBLA program is
difficult to assess because utilities are ``not very specific'' with their
cost savings information. He cautioned that the industry's projected
$590-million total lifetime savings are based on conservative estimates by
utilities and could actually reflect higher savings.
   ``We believe that the combined lifetime industry savings is a very
conservative estimate because some licensees have not provided total
estimated savings but rather have simply indicated that savings realized
from the CBLA would exceed the $100,000 criteria,'' he said. ``For
uniformity, cost data submitted by licensees are presented as savings over
the remainder of the 40-year plant design life.''
   The CBLA program, which has been institutionalized in NRR, grew out of a
task force established in April 1993 as part of an NRC effort to help
nuclear utilities control operations and maintenance costs. The CBLA task
force was one of several groups established within the agency to work on
streamlining the regulatory process and reducing regulatory burdens on
industry.
   Two years ago, the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) forecast that
utilities would submit 400 CBLA requests a year during 1994 and 1995--far
more than have actually been submitted. Of the 272 CBLA requests submitted
by utilities so far, the NRC has approved 173 and denied 11. Utilities
withdrew three requests, and 85 submittals are still under review.
   During the six-month period ending December 14, the NRC denied one CBLA
request, a submittal by Northeast Nuclear Energy Co. for Millstone-1. The
utility had requested a revised exemption from Appendix R to eliminate
reliance on maronite boards as radiant heat shields in the cable vault
area. The NRC decided that the proposal would not provide an ``equivalent
level of fire safety to that required by Section III.G of Appendix R,'' the
memorandum said.

NRC APPROVES INDUSTRY GUIDELINE FOR MANAGING COMMITMENTS

By:
Kathleen Hart, Washington

   Executive Director for Operations James Taylor signed a Secy information
paper December 20, approving a commitment management program developed by
the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI).
   Secy 95-300, a Secy paper that does not require commission action,
finalizes the agency's approval of NEI's guidance for managing NRC
commitments, said Gene Imbro, head of the Office of Nuclear Reactor
Regulation (NRR) regulatory review group and cost-beneficial licensing
action (CBLA) program. The Secy paper caps more than 20 months of joint
industry-NRC work to develop a way to help utilities manage the thousands
of commitments on the books and eliminate those no longer deemed
significant to safe plant operation.
   About half of the industry is already using the guidance, and they are
saving money, according to Stephen Floyd, NEI manager of special projects,
who developed the guidance document. Floyd said that some utilities have
estimated ``a couple million dollars already in direct savings,'' while
others have projected several million dollars in soft savings (INRC, 13
Nov. '95, 1).
   Imbro said the commission paper contains a letter that the agency plans
to send to NEI endorsing the use of the industry commitment management
guideline. NEI intends to send a copy of the letter to all nuclear
utilities, along with the guidance document.
   The average nuclear power plant has between 8,000 and 10,000 commitments
per unit. Currently, there is no uniform method used by utilities for
determining how to change or drop commitments, NRC staffers noted. Adoption
of the NEI guidance document would be entirely voluntary.

NRC ORDER BARRING MAINE YANKEE RESTART COULD BE CLEARED THIS MONTH

By:
David Stellfox, Washington

   A restart of Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co.'s Maine Yankee could still
come this month, plant officials say, despite an NRC order January 3
barring restart of the unit.
   Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation Director William Russell issued the
order blocking Maine Yankee from restarting until it has satisfied certain
concerns about the safety analyses for the plant's emergency core cooling
system (ECCS) and containment.
   Once documentation is submitted to NRC addressing those initial
concerns, Maine Yankee will be allowed to start up. However, operation will
be restricted to 2,440-MW thermal, about a 10% derating, while NRC is
reviewing the material provided and until a new safety analysis for the
ECCS and containment is provided for operating at higher thermal power
levels.
   The plant's originally licensed thermal power is 2,440-MW thermal, but
NRC had granted it two power uprates in the 1980s. The unit was last
operating at 2,700-MW thermal.
   Maine Yankee spokesman Marshall Murphy said January 4 he expected the
plant would restart in ``the January time frame.''
   A planned restart in late December--after a one year outage to repair
steam generators--was derailed when an anonymous allegation was made that
the plant's safety analyses for ECCS and containment design were faulty
(INRC, 25 Dec. '95, 1).
   In its January 3 order, NRC said that it approved the use of the Yankee
Atomic Electric Co. (YAEC) version of a computer code, Relap5-YA, for
analyzing Maine Yankee's ECCS in 1989, but with ``twelve conditions,
including specifications for future plant specific licensing submittals,
justifying options taken and sensitivity studies performed.''
   NRC never followed up on the demands for information until after the
allegation was made December 4, 1995 and it found ``(t)his licensee has not
provided the justifications or submittals specified....''
   At a December 18 meeting at NRC, YAEC President Andrew Kadak said that
the material was held on site because, although the staff's safety
evaluation report called for submittals, a related NRC letter at the time
spoke of NRC audits. However, Maine Yankee spokesman Murphy could not
confirm that last week. Murphy said plant officials were still reviewing
the entire order, including ``taking a look at that language.''
   NRC noted that its order addresses only future operation and does not
address allegations related to violations of NRC requirements in the past,
including allegations of wrongdoing, which will be dealt with separately.
   According to the order, Maine Yankee must supply the following material
prior to restart:
   -- A description of evaluations that have been completed that provide
justification for the use of the current cycle's operating limits, as
established in the Cycle 15 Core Operating Limits Report, using methods
approved for Maine Yankee and without reliance on the Relap5-YA computer
code for small break loss-of-coolant accidents (SBLOCA) analysis and
assuming a reactor thermal rating of 2,440 MWt. Details related to analyses
performed, significant assumptions, and conclusions drawn shall be
provided.
   -- A description of all other applications where Relap5-YA is relied on
for Cycle 15 operation identifying the details of the application, and
conclusions drawn with respect to any facility modifications or procedure
changes. For each application, document the determination that operability,
as defined in Maine Yankee Technical Specifications, of affected
structures, systems and components is maintained. For plant procedures
required by Maine Yankee Technical Specifications that rely on Relap5-YA
analysis for operator action, document the determination as to why the
affected operator action continues to be appropriate or, if necessary,
evaluate the affected procedures in accordance with 10 CFR Section 50.59
and provide a summary of that evaluation. If any procedures are changed,
confirm that appropriate training has been provided.
   -- A description of measures taken to limit reactor operation to a
maximum thermal power of 2,440 MWt (90.37% of 2,700 MWt).
   -- A description of measures taken to limit containment internal
operating pressure to a maximum of 2 psig.
   Also, according to the order, Maine Yankee has 30 days to supply the
following information:
   -- A SBLOCA analysis that is specific to Maine Yankee for operation at

WHISTLE-BLOWERS SAY AGENCY SHOULD SUSPEND PLANT OPERATING LICENSES

By:
Dave Airozo Washington

   Two whistle-blowers locked in years-long battles with Georgia Power Co.
and the Southern Nuclear Operating Co. over alleged harassment want NRC to
immediately suspend the companies' nuclear plant operating licenses and
fine them more than $20-million because, the whistle-blowers say, the
discrimination by senior management continues.
   Late last week the whistle-blowers, Allen Mosbaugh and Marvin Hobby,
were expected to file a so-called 2.206 petition with NRC in which they
argue that the agency's own regulations require that the drastic action be
taken and the hefty fines meted out. They contend that senior managers of
the companies have repeatedly violated NRC whistle-blower protection
provisions and that the agency must escalate enforcement action.
   Last year, both Mosbaugh and Hobby won Department of Labor (DOL) cases
against the companies over alleged retaliation for whistle-blowing. In both
cases, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich directed the companies to reinstate
the men and ordered payment of other damages.
   In mid-December, Georgia Power filed a motion with DOL's Office of
Administrative Appeals asking that the record in the Mosbaugh case be
reopened and further hearings be held. In the motion, Georgia Power noted
that during the DOL proceeding, NRC's Office of Investigations had held on
to 76 tape recordings Mosbaugh had surreptitiously made of fellow employees
while he was assistant general manager of the Vogtle nuclear plant. OI used
the tapes recordings as part of its own investigation into Mosbaugh's
allegations of wrongdoing by Georgia Power management. The tapes were not
given to Georgia Power until after the record in the Labor proceeding was
closed, and Georgia Power now claims that the tapes contain significant
information that would have affected Reich's decision.
   Georgia Power also plans to appeal Reich's decision in the Hobby case
but the proceeding is in limbo at DOL because of the federal government's
budget crisis and resulting government employee furloughs, Georgia Power
spokesman Tal Wright said January 4.
   NRC is already considering ``escalated enforcement action'' because of
the Mosbaugh harassment case.
   In a draft of the 2.206 petition, the whistle-blowers note that Reich
specifically identified A.W. Dahlberg, former Georgia Power president and
now president, chief executive officer and chairman of the board of
Southern Co. as having had an ``active role'' in the ``illegal'' firings of
Hobby and Mosbaugh. They charge that the discrimination against Hobby and
Mosbaugh, and Georgia Power's refusal to reinstate them, continues to have
a ``chilling effect'' on Georgia Power and Southern Nuclear workers and
that the NRC should fine the companies $200,000 a day for each day that
Hobby and Mosbaugh are not reinstated.
   With the meter running from the date of Reich's decisions, the fine
would total $20-million as of January 4.
   In their petition, the whistle-blowers also note that George Hairston
and Kenneth McCoy, both Georgia Power senior managers, were involved in
providing NRC with inaccurate or incomplete information regarding the
equipment performance and test results following a 1990
loss-of-offsite-power incident at Vogtle (INRC, 20 Feb. '95, 8).
   The whistle-blowers suggest that the repeated involvement of senior
officials in these cases reveals a pattern of noncompliance with NRC
regulations and that the agency must impose strong sanctions, including the
suspension of the operating licenses until the alleged management problem
is corrected.
   NRC regulations (10 CFR Part 2) do call for progressively stiffer
enforcement actions for repeated violations of the same requirements within
a two-year period. The agency has already hit Georgia Power with a Severity
Level II violation and a $200,000 fine for supplying inaccurate and
incomplete information related to the Vogtle incident and, as noted above,
is considering more in response to the Mosbaugh case.
   Under the NRC guidelines, if a licensee is slapped with two Severity
Level II violations within the two-year period, suspension of affected
operations should be considered.
   ``The actual progression to be used in a particular case will depend on
the circumstances,' the regulations say. ``Enforcement sanctions will
normally escalate for recurring similar violations.''

FOUR UTILITIES EXPECT SAVINGS FROM JOINT STANDARD TECH SPEC SUBMITTAL

By:
Wilson Dizard III, Washington

   Four Region IV utilities expect savings that could range into the
millions of dollars from their banding together to submit their standard
technical specifications applications to NRC.
   Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PG&E), Texas Utilities Electric Co. (TUEC),
Union Electric Co., and Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp. (WNOC) joined
forces late last year to coordinate their joint standard tech spec
conversion. The utilities presented their plans to NRC staff at a November
14 meeting.
   Roger Walker, manager of nuclear licensing for TUEC, told Inside N.R.C.
that the savings from the standard tech spec conversion process could run
between $1- and $4-million a year.
   Alan Passwater, licensing manager for Union Electric's Callaway, said
his utility earlier planned to conduct a joint standard tech spec submittal
with WNOC, because Wolf Creek and Callaway were built to the standard SNPPS
(Standardized Nuclear Power Plant System) design devised by Westinghouse in
the mid-1970s. Passwater said extending the joint standard tech spec
application to four utilities would likely save his utility $200,000.
   The four utilities all operate one nuclear station each. All of the
units are in NRC Region IV, and all are two-train, four-loop Westinghouse
units.
   Managers for the four utilities see the joint tech spec application as
the first of what could become several joint efforts in dealing with NRC.
   NRC has been pressing nuclear plant operators to adopt standard
technical specifications (INRC, 15 May '95, 8). NRC staff estimate that up
to 40% of the surveillances required under existing tech specs could be
eliminated under standard tech specs. By mid-1995, close to 50 plants had
committed formally to standard tech spec conversion.
   Walker said that the four utilities plan to submit their joint
application in December 1996. ``It's a long, elaborate process,'' Walker
said, noting that the application would run well into the hundreds of
pages.
   ``We did an economic estimate before we started,'' Walker said. ``We
estimated hard savings and soft savings.'' The hard savings flowed from
requirements that would be dropped, and the soft savings were estimated to
come from avoided plant shutdowns.
   ``The soft savings were much stronger than the hard savings,'' Walker
said.
   Walker noted that some procedure changes that would require tech spec
changes under current conditions could be handled through NRC's 50.59
process under the standard tech specs.
   Walker also expects faster service from NRC in any future tech spec
changes after the standard tech specs are adopted.
   Steve Wideman, supervisor of licensing for Wolf Creek, said the impetus
for the joint standard tech spec submittal flowed from senior management
meetings among the four utilities last summer. He noted the joint submittal
would also save the utilities some of the NRC review fees associated with
the process.
   Pat Nugent, tech spec supervisor for PG&E's Diablo Canyon, said, ``We
believe there is some economic benefit. Also, NRC has been pushing the
industry hard to go to standard tech specs.''
   The four utilities expect that NRC will take four to six months to
review their standard tech spec application, which takes the schedule out
to mid-1997. The new tech specs will be implemented in the middle of an
operating cycle at each unit, but the utilities have not reached that point
in their planning yet.
   Some of the utilities are in the process of seeking line item changes to
their existing tech specs, a process that NRC staff said would continue
while the joint standard tech specs are developed.
   NRC staff told the utilities at the November 14 meeting that the
application process could be accelerated if the applications were sent
electronically.

DUKE POWER

By:
Kathleen Hart, Washington

   DUKE POWER EXPECTS TO SAVE $2.7-MILLION AT THE OCONEE NUCLEAR PLANT by
changing the qualified life of pressure transmitters installed in the
reactor containment buildings of the three units.
   The 105 pressure transmitters inside the containment buildings all had a
10-year qualified life, based on the assumption that they would be subject
to ambient temperatures of 120 degrees F. Robert Smith, an engineer at
Duke, who for years had been pushing to install temperature devices in the
containments to determine the real temperature, last year installed
temperature monitoring data loggers at Oconee.
   The actual ambient temperature level in the basement was only 80 degrees
F, which allowed Duke to change the qualified life of the transmitters, and
obviated the need to replace them for the remaining operating life of the
unit, Smith said. The idea to install the temperature devices grew out of a
program instituted at Duke Power three years ago to review the
environmental qualification (EQ) of electrical equipment coming up for a
changeout before each outage, he added.
   Duke is continuing to analyze electrical equipment based on the actual
temperatures in which they run and expects to save several hundred thousand
dollars--maybe close to $1-million--on replacement costs for changing other
electrical equipment, such as level switches and solenoid valves, said
Smith.
   The utility also ``is looking at installing temperature monitoring
equipment at Catawba and McGuire, where greater savings are projected,''
according to Duke spokesperson Rick Zuercher.

NRC, FEMA, INDUSTRY WORKING TO DEVELOP MORE REALISTIC EP DRILLS

By:
Tom Harrison, Washington

   The NRC is working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
and industry organizations to develop more realistic emergency planning
(EP) drill scenarios that participants say will improve training and reduce
costs for plant owners.
   Members of the Realism in Scenarios Working Group include
representatives from the NRC, FEMA, the Institute of Nuclear Power
Operations (INPO), the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), and the Conference
of Radiation Control Program Directors (CRCPD).
   The idea originated with NRC senior management, who saw room for
improvement after participating in EP drills, said Aby Mohseni, NRC
emergency response coordinator.
   ``There are some good scenarios out there, but there are some that are
not as logical and coherent as others,'' he said.
   For example, a scenario might involve a plant having significant core
damage without major problems with core cooling, which is not possible.
   Or to test various parts of the plant in the drill, events could include
a plane crash, an earthquake, an on-site fire and several employees
suffering heart attacks--all within the space of a few hours.
   The NRC is searching its database to develop criteria for what makes a
good scenario, Mohseni said, and wants to have those attributes identified
within a couple of months.
   After that, the group, which held its first meeting in December, plans
to have a plant volunteer to test the criteria in an upcoming drill.
   The criteria aren't intended to become a regulation or increase costs,
and may eventually save money for utilities, he said.
   After the group develops a repository of scenarios, utilities will be
able to reuse them instead of having to come up with their own, he said.
   Every other year, each plant is required to hold a graded drill, which
is overseen and assessed by NRC officials. These biennial drills also
involve state and local governments, whose performance is evaluated by
FEMA.
   ``We've had 15 years of experience since TMI in doing the major
exercises,'' Mohseni said. ``Those 15 years have shed some light on where
we could get more benefit in training.''
   Plants also hold at least one emergency plan drill a year involving the
NRC and other outside agencies and conduct several drills annually on their
own.
   Costs for drills range from thousands of dollars to tens of thousands
depending on the number of people involved and the scope of the exercise.
   The biennial drills traditionally involve the release of enough
radioactivity to require several miles around the plant to be evacuated,
which allows FEMA to meet its requirements.
   Emergency planners say the scenarios are unrealistic because they have
to meet objectives set by the NRC and FEMA.
   ``You've got to break things in the plant that are almost beyond
belief,'' said Jim Weeks, manager of emergency planning at Wolf Creek.
   The scenarios also don't allow operators to be successful in solving
problems, he said.
   ``Operators know no matter what they do, they're going to go to a
general emergency,'' he said. ``From the operations people's point of view,
they're not getting much value out of it because they know they're not
going to be successful.''
   That results in negative training, said scenario group member Ron
Fraass, a public health physicist with the state of Kansas.
   ``It keeps control room operators from taking some ideas and running
with it,'' he said.
   Many utilities develop their own scenarios in-house. Paying a consultant
to devise a scenario can cost $60,000, according to industry estimates.

WORLD REGULATORS AGREE MORE WORK NEEDED TO LEAVE CIRC CRACKS IN PLACE

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   Significant improvements are needed in plugging criteria and crack
sizing before circumferentially cracked steam generator tubes can be left
in service, a group of experts from the nuclear industry, research and
regulatory bodies agreed late last year.
   Those improvements depend, in part, on a much broader base of experience
of past degradation, better understanding of why and how flaws develop, and
more robust nondestructive examination (NDE) tools and analysis methods.
   As for criteria used to determine response to axial cracking, the
experts found present voltage-based criteria acceptable for now, but said
the criteria have weaknesses that may be offset in the future by improved
technology for sizing cracks.
   In any case, the experts said, international collaboration is needed to
develop more realistic plugging criteria based on examination of pulled
tubes and laboratory-produced cracks.
   At an international workshop devoted to steam generator tube integrity,
sponsored by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) and hosted by the NRC's
Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research at the Argonne National Laboratory
near Chicago, 100 experts from 15 countries explored the extent of
knowledge on different types of steam generator degradation.
   Much has been learned since the NEA's last steam generator meeting in
Brussels in 1991. But participants decided that because of the evolving
nature of tube degradation any definitive conclusions would be premature,
according to Jean-Pierre Clausner, the NEA staffer responsible for the
workshop.
   Reports on the meeting were presented late last year to the NEA's
Committee on Nuclear Regulatory Activities (CNRA) and to its Committee on
the Safety of Nuclear Installations (CSNI), sponsors of the workshop. The
experts' findings and recommendations were numerous and detailed, given
that they met in parallel sessions covering tube degradation, inspection,
integrity, preventive and corrective measures, and operational aspects of
risk analysis.

Group Recommends Pulling More Tubes
   According to a summary prepared for the CNRA/CSNI, several of the
workshop sessions highlighted the need to pull and examine for analysis
more tubes and tube/tube support plate assemblies from both operating and
retired steam generators. The examinations are considered key to defining
the precise conditions of crevice chemistry, developing better NDE
standards, providing prototype flaw specimens for integrity testing, and
evaluating such repair techniques as sleeving.
   The CNRA did not follow a recommendation from the Argonne meeting to
develop an international data base on tube pressure and leakage testing and
destructive examinations, Clausner said--not because it isn't needed, but
because the committee members felt such data would be very difficult for
regulators to gather because it belongs logically to the nuclear industry.
   On the other hand, he said, the committee recommended that the CSNI's
working group on component integrity intensify its monitoring of the
phenomena involved in steam generator tube degradation, permitting a more
complete review of the international situation within the next two years.
   The Argonne workshop agreed that circumferential and axial cracks in
steam generator tubes should continue to be treated separately with respect
to their impact on safety, according to the NEA summary. In general, better
inspection tools for early detection of stress corrosion cracking (SCC),
more experimental data on outer-diameter SCC crack initiation and growth,
improved monitoring instrumentation, and better understanding of local
stress/strain conditions are needed, as is a better correlation of
chemistry and microstructure with SCC susceptibility, the experts found.
   They agreed that periodic NDE is not very useful in detecting
fatigue-induced cracks, for which plants must depend on leak-before-break
methods to manage degradation. Greater attention is needed to processes
initiating at regions of mild deformation, such as denting and scratches,
they said, and the impact of tube support plate ligament cracking--now
observed at several plants, notably in France--is ``not thoroughly
understood,'' they said.
   Officials agreed that reliable crack detection and sizing are important
even if circumferentially cracked tubes are plugged on detection. The
detection threshold for circumferential cracks with eddy current testing is
only about 50% throughwall, pointing to the need for other NDE methods.
Ultrasonic techniques (UT) have potential, but ``there are problems with
false positive calls, and improvements are clearly needed,'' officials
said.
   Accurate sizing information is needed to develop data on crack growth
rate. However, sizing cracks is more difficult than detecting them, they
said.
   Robert Comby of Electricite de France's Central Laboratories (GDL), said
that only two of the countries participating in the Argonne workshop use
tube plugging criteria for circumferential cracking based on analysis, not
mere detection. They are Belgium and Canada. The Canadians plug the tubes
all the same, he said. Comby said very intricate work is used to analyze
outer-diameter circumferential cracking, which is ``very diverse'' in
nature and evolves in a way that is still poorly understood.
   One of the French participants, Guy Turluer of the Institute of Nuclear
Safety & Protection (IPSN), said that the dilemma highlighted by the
Argonne meeting was that ``few countries have feedback from operating
experience'' concerning circumferential cracking. ``We don't know the
nature of the corrosive environment. It's hard to reproduce in the
laboratory,'' he said.

No Consensus On Continued Use
   The Argonne workshop could reach ``no consensus on the question of
leaving tubes with circumferential cracks in service,'' the NEA summary
said. But the experts discussing tube integrity agreed that ``regulatory
requirements should be flexible to allow adapting to changing technology
and operating experience,'' for example to allow implementation of
degradation-specific management.
   Another group considered the status and efficacy of preventive and
corrective measures used to mitigate or overcome tube degradation. On the
issue of mechanical mitigation, they found that successful tube sleeving
``requires development of qualification guidelines and a procedure
checklist,'' observing that ``many early failures were associated with
application outside of the process window.''
   While sleeves can generally be adequately inspected, the group said that
integrity validation requires that sleeved tubes be removed and examined. 
Nickel-plating of the tubes, as used for example in Belgium, can be applied
at almost all tube locations. However, inspection of those tubes requires
UT rather than eddy current techniques.
   Direct tube repair by remelting and welding can be applied primarily at
tube support plate intersections, the group said, but it complicates
subsequent inspections because eddy current tests are not effective and the
rough surface makes UT more difficult. Shot- or roto-peening before service
guards well against primary water SCC, but post-service peening can at best
delay the onset of cracking, they said. The group recommended cold-leg
peening where PWSCC is the primary mode of tube degradation.
   To prevent degradation, workshop participants said, ``good sludge
control is essential.'' Steam generator crevice chemistry is still
inadequately characterized, ``making it difficult to evaluate water
chemistry remedies,'' they said. They recommended a significant steam
generator tube sampling program to increase knowledge about crevices.
   The ultimate remedy for tube degradation, steam generator replacement,
should be effective, they said, since new steam generator designs minimize
stresses and sludge buildup, and new alloys--690 and 800--should provide
sufficient protection against corrosion.
   Finally, the Argonne workshop agreed on the need to improve human
reliability information and methods used in probabilistic analysis of steam
generator tube rupture events. They approved the implementation of on-line
leakage monitoring, but called for improved correlation between leakage and
degradation for various tube degradation modes as well as for a more
refined technical basis for operational leakage limits. They also said the
role of steam generator tube degradation in overall plant risk should be
better appreciated.

GOOD MARKS FOR BEZNAU-1 AND -2 IN INTERNATIONAL ASSESSMENT

By:
Laura Pilarski, Zurich

   Switzerland's 364-MW Beznau-1 and -2 have achieved an ``excellent''
record, said an IAEA Operational Safety Review Team (Osart) which completed
a three-week review December 1.
   Osarts compare performance to best international practices. The audit
was made at the request of the Swiss government in a general effort to
enhance operational nuclear safety and not because of any specific safety
concerns. An official Beznau report will be submitted to Bern in a few
months.
   Nordostschweizerische Kraftwerke AG (NOK), owner of the two PWRs, was
commended for several areas of performance, including having an experienced
and capable staff with a strong apprenticeship program; a commitment to
highest work quality standards, with good condition and cleanliness of
plant equipment; imbuing station management and staff with high goals; and
utilizing state-of-the-art safety analysis techniques to ensure high safety
standards are maintained.
   Among the Osart's proposals for improvement were: conducting reviews of
abnormal operating events in more depth and giving more attention to human
performance factors contributing to these events; providing improved
guidelines to examine plant conditions before returning to power operation
following reactor trips; strengthening management safety policies and
guidance to the staff; fostering a more self-questioning attitude among
staffers in performing plant activities; and increasing management
exchanges with nuclear power plants internationally.
   An Osart team will return to Beznau for a follow-up visit sometime in
1997. The Swiss review was the 86th plant reviewed in the Osart program.
The cost, which the owner and plant assume, is estimated at more than
1-million Swiss francs and includes all internal costs of special reports,
documentation, and files.
   Nuclear opponents in Switzerland tend to disparage Osart reviews, saying
they are not concerned with possible technical problems and plant design.

NEI WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH IN '96 FOR THERMO-LAG WAIVERS UNTIL NEW RULE

By:
David Stellfox, Washington

   A Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) executive says the industry lobby
organization will continue to push NRC to waive certain fire protection
requirements on Thermo-Lag fire barriers until a new rule can be
developed.
   NRC Chairman Shirley Jackson told Inside N.R.C. November 15, 1995 that
she opposed the idea. It is an idea that has been floating around for a
long time, but was resurrected formally with NRC staff on November 8, 1995
by Bill Rasin, NEI vice president for technical issues.
   Despite Jackson's apparent opposition, NEI Executive Vice President Joe
Colvin said his organization would continue to push for that option in
1996.
   ``We have not given up on that approach,'' Colvin said. ``I think the
staff at the leadership level is receptive to this approach because they're
spending a lot of resources and we are too.''
   NEI would have to ``have communication with Chairman Jackson and
Commissioner Rogers and the senior staff'' about the issue, Colvin said in
remarks prior to Commissioner Greta Dicus' Senate confirmation.
   NEI is due to have a meeting with NRC senior staff on the issue this
month and a staff paper to the commission on Thermo-Lag resolution is
overdue.
   The problem of unqualified Thermo-Lag fire barriers dates back to
1991-92 and still remains, according to some estimates, years away from
resolution.
   The problem with the fire protection issues, Colvin said, particularly
Thermo-Lag is that ``it's not just a technical issue. It's not just a
licensing issue. It's got political overtones.''
   He said ``everyone agrees'' that the fire protection regulations require
adjustment so if the agency is going to change the regulations anyway, why
force compliance with the old ones in the interim when compensatory
measures taken are adequate to insure safety.
   Looking ahead to 1996, Colvin said he sees the industry-NRC relationship
as positive. He said a dialog has been opened up. The two parties are
comparing notes as to what their respective priorities are to make best use
of both industry and NRC resources. One of the most positive signs, Colvin
said, is that the dialog with NRC is now ``engaged at the EDO level'' and
includes the office heads.
   One of the most often cited past successes of industry/NRC cooperation
has been the maintenance rule. When it came to developing the regulatory
guidance for the maintenance rule, which takes effect in July, senior
industry officials and senior NRC officials sat down to iron out the
guidance. The result was considered a success by both sides and yet ``the
maintenance rule approach'' has been unsuccessful when applied elsewhere.
   It was first tried on the license renewal rule and ``it didn't work,''
there, Colvin said. Then, it was tried on the maintenance rule and ``it
worked tremendously (well).''
   Then it was tried on graded quality assurance (QA) and it didn't work,
Colvin said. ``It's people and perception driven.'' All these issues,
particularly the QA, is ``talking about changing the way people do things.
That makes people nervous--at both utilities and NRC,'' he said.
   One advantage with the use of the approach on the maintenance rule, was
that NRC didn't use outside contractors and high-level staffers
participated in themeetings and made decisions, Colvin said. It was the
strong leadership from both the industry and agency side that made the
difference, he said.
   He said NEI would be continuing to try to use the maintenance rule model
of looking at systems, structures and components and their risk and try to
apply that in other contexts in 1996.
   The failure, so far, of the graded QA effort Colvin said it is ``very
difficult to get the mindset changed. The QA infrastructure runs long and
deep in the industry and in NRC. It's almost sacred. There's a lot of
emotion you got to get through before you can get down to details.''

CRITICS FEAR ANOTHER `BROWNS FERRY' AS NRC OKAYS COMBUSTIBLE FIRE STOPS

By:
David Stellfox, Washington

   A silicone foam or elastomer sealant material--used to block the spread
of fires at the soon-to-be licensed Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Watts
Bar plant--is combustible and prone to ``deep-seated fires,'' NRC says.
   Nonetheless, the agency said the material is an ``acceptable deviation''
from requirements limiting fire stops to noncombustible materials.
   The antinuclear group Nuclear Information & Resource Service (NIRS) and
a private fire protection engineer contend that the NRC violated federal
law when it authorized the use of the admittedly combustible fire seals at
Watts Bar.
   Four years before the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island-2, TVA's Browns
Ferry plant had a near meltdown after a fire started in a penetration seal
made of combustible urethane. Penetration seals are used to stop a fire
from spreading from one room or fire area to another.
   But at Browns Ferry, the fire quickly spread through electrical control
equipment, disabling systems needed to safely shut off the nuclear chain
reaction. That near disaster led to the creation of NRC's current fire
protection requirements that call for the use of noncombustible materials.
   The NRC staff decision that Watts Barr could use combustible silicone
materials to seal penetrations through fire walls and floors has alarmed
nuclear watchdogs. NIRS wrote to NRC Chairman Shirley Jackson saying that
Watts Bar should be denied a full-power operating license because it does
not meet fire protection requirements. The commission is expected to issue
the full-power license to Watts Bar within a few weeks.
   Jackson would not comment on the issue, and staffers in her office
referred inquiries to the NRC Public Affairs Office. Agency spokesman Joe
Gilliland said that, as of January 4, no official response had been made to
NIRS.
   In a letter to Jackson in late December, NIRS said it was ``ironic''
that NRC would consider licensing a TVA plant with combustible penetration
seals 20 years after a fire at another TVA plant prompted the agency to
adopt fire protection rules specifically to bar the use of such material.
   Equally ironic, nuclear watchdogs said, is that the argument NRC staff
used to justify use of the seals is remarkably similar to an argument it
recently rejected for an unrelated fire protection material.
   That fire barrier material, known as Thermo-Lag, is used to protect
electrical cables and components used to shut down reactors.
   The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), the nuclear industry trade
association, tried unsuccessfully to claim that Thermo-Lag was
noncombustible using arguments similar to what NRC used to accept the
combustible penetration seals.
   Gerald Brown, a Minneapolis-based fire protection engineer, claimed that
by waiving requirements on penetration seals, NRC is trying to avoid an
expensive drain on both industry and NRC resources.
   Other industry sources say privately that NRC treated Thermo-Lag more
strictly because Thermo-Lag had become a political problem for them,
particularly after a congressional hearing in 1993. Problems with fire
barrier penetration seals have not gotten the same level of public
attention.
   It was Brown's 1991 allegations on Thermo-Lag that prompted a wholesale
upheaval in nuclear industry fire protection programs. His 1991 allegations
were confirmed by NRC and led the agency to disqualify all prior testing of
Thermo-Lag and to declare all those barriers inoperable--a matter still
unresolved five years later.
   As a fire protection consultant, Brown potentially stands to gain
business from utilities upgrading fire protection programs and equipment.
   Brown said the nuclear power industry, in attempting to requalify
Thermo-Lag in the last five years, wanted to claim that the material was
``noncombustible.'' They did so with the argument that given the difficulty
of igniting the material, the location in the plant, and the absence of any
other combustibles to start or feed a fire, Thermo-Lag was ``effectively''
noncombustible.
   NRC rejected that argument (INRC, 3 April '95, 3), but then turned
around and used a remarkably similar approach to justify the use of
combustible fire penetration seals at Watts Bar, Brown said. ``That's
ludicrous. It's a double standard, and it's against the law.''
   NRC's Conrad McCracken, the plant systems branch chief in the Office of
Nuclear Reactor Regulation, doesn't deny that the silicone seals are
combustible. McCracken couldn't be reached for comment, but in a December
21 response letter to Paul Gunter of NIRS, McCracken wrote: ``The NRC staff
acknowledges that silicone foam and silicone elastomer penetration seal
materials are combustible as defined by NRC fire protection guidance.''
   However, McCracken wrote Gunter that the seal material does provide some
protection; it acts as a sacrificial material and is accepted in many
non-nuclear applications. Incidentally, the same is true of Thermo-Lag.
   The seal material ``make up a relatively small contribution to the
overall combustible load...are usually distributed throughout the fire
area, as opposed to representing concentrations of combustibles, and are
difficult to ignite,'' McCracken wrote. Finally, McCracken concluded the
use of the silicone seals ``is an acceptable deviation from the penetration
seal guidance in Nureg-0800.''
   In a separate response to an e-mail allegation from Brown, McCracken
acknowledged that a fire ``may become deep-seated within the penetration.''
Brown says this makes it appear the fire has been extinguished when deep
inside the seal it is still burning.
   The NRC's fire protection requirements are prescriptive, Brown said. Is
the material combustible or isn't it? he asked. To say it is combustible
but that's an acceptable deviation is not prescriptive regulation, Brown
said. ``That's a performance-based answer,'' he said. NRC has so far
refused industry attempts to resolve problems with Thermo-Lag by using
performance-based approaches, Brown noted, and now the NRC is turning
around and using a performance-based approach for penetration seals.
   Besides the apparent double standard, Brown maintained NRC cannot
legally make an acceptable deviation on the penetration seals. He said that
unlike the situation with Thermo-Lag, penetration seals are specifically
addressed in the federal Code of Federal Regulations. Brown added that NRC
does not have the right to waive federal law but can only promulgate new,
superseding law. For Thermo-Lag, the requirements are in subsidiary
guidance documents giving NRC greater flexibility in interpretation and
enforcement.
   But penetration seals are specifically addressed in 10 CFR Part 50,
Appendix R, Section M, which says, in part: ``Penetration seal designs
shall utilize only noncombustible materials and shall be qualified by tests
that are comparable to tests used to rate fire barriers.''
   Brown, who also filed allegations over the penetration seals, claimed
NRC has been ignoring problems with the seals. Many of the problems related
to seals with voids and gaps and other issues are contained in NRC's own
files, and others were documented in a series of Inside N.R.C. articles in
1994 (INRC, 19 Sept. '94, 1 and INRC, 17 Oct. '94, 1).
   Thousands of similar silicone foam or elastomer seals are installed in
nuclear units across the country.
   In addition to their combustibility, questions have been raised about
the effectiveness of the seals. Penetration seal problems related to
installation, testing, documentation and poor maintenance, go back at least
15 years and rival problems associated with the controversial Thermo-Lag
material.
   In 1987 NRC drafted guidance on penetration seals intended to clarify
what was needed to qualify a seal. The guidance was leaked to industry
officials, then mysteriously dropped from the regulatory agenda and was
never issued (INRC, 6 March '95, 1). NRC officials have claimed the
penetration seal requirements in the leaked document were incorporated into
other NRC regulations, but industry sources have strongly disputed that.
The question has never been resolved.
   Brown said the NRC simply doesn't want to face up to the problems with
penetration seals so ``they are carefully selecting regulations (to
enforce) to suit the industry. This is the most flagrant and fraudulent
example.''

DICUS TO ASSUME DUTIES AS COMMISSIONER IN FEBRUARY, RESTORING QUORUM

By:
Kathleen Hart, Washington

   The Senate confirmed Greta Joy Dicus as an NRC commissioner December 22,
paving the way for restoring a three-person quorum to the commission.
   Dicus, who is director of the Division of Radiation Control & Emergency
Management at the Arkansas Department of Health, said that she hopes to be
ready to assume her duties as commissioner in early February. ``I have a
lot of goals I hope to accomplish in my time on the commission, but I want
to get up there and get a staff together before I get into those goals,''
she told Inside N.R.C. January 4.
   Dicus' term runs through June 30, 1998. No date has been set yet for an
official swearing-in ceremony.
   The commission has been acting without a quorum since July 1, 1995 when
Gail de Planque left after her five-year term as a commissioner ended and
Ivan Selin quit as chairman a year early. Currently, Chairman Shirley
Jackson is making commission decisions--in consultation with Commissioner
Kenneth Rogers--under an arrangement of ``delegated authority'' approved by
the commission when it still had four members.
   Clinton nominated Dicus July 14, 1995 to fill a third seat on the
commission. Dicus faced no opposition in the Senate Environment & Public
Works Committee, which approved her nomination September 19 (INRC, 2 Oct.
'95, 15). The fast-track nomination process stalled, however, when Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) made it clear to the White House that
he would not schedule a confirmation vote until President Clinton sent to
the Senate an intent to nominate a Republican to the five-member
commission.
   Ultimately, Dole relented and allowed the confirmation to go forward. A
White House staffer said January 2 that the administration is ``looking at
other candidates'' to fill the remaining two seats on the commission, but
has sent no names to the Senate since the Dicus nomination.
   Dicus was among more than 65 executive nominations cleared for a Senate
vote on December 22. Charles William Burton of Texas was confirmed as a
member of the board of the U.S. Enrichment Corporation (USEC) for a term
that lasts only until February 24. Kathleen McGinty of Pennsylvania was
confirmed as chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality.
   There had been speculation on the Hill that Dole let the nominations go
through to avoid the need to have the names all renominated in the second
session of the Congress. Because of the ongoing budget problems, however,
the first session of the 104th Congress was declared over, sine die, at
11:55 a.m. January 3. The second session began at noon.
   Dicus served as a member of the USEC board for a one-year term that
ended in March 1995. She is a member of the Conference of Radiation Control
Program Directors (CRCPD) and was elected chairman of the CRCPD in 1993.
Dicus, who has served as Arkansas liaison to the NRC, received her B.A.
from Texas Woman's University in Denton, Texas in 1961 and an M.A. in
radiation biology from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School
at Dallas in 1967.

Number Of Secy Papers, Commission Meetings Down
   The commission continued a downward trend in the number of Secy papers
handled in 1995. The staff produced 310 Secy papers last year, down
slightly from the 315 papers in 1994, and down significantly from the 360
papers produced in 1993.
   Also, there were fewer commission meetings last year than in the
previous year, according to Andrew Bates, senior level adviser to the
secretary of the commission. There were 86 commission meetings held in
1995, compared with 92 meetings in 1994. Fifty-two of the 86 meetings took
place in the first half of 1995, and 34 meetings in the second half.
   Part of the reason for the decline in the number of meetings can be
attributed to the fact that there have only been two commissioners since
July 1, 1995, and the staff has tried not to schedule commission meetings
when one of them is away or on leave.
   The schedule for commission briefings for the month of January is very
light. Except for one briefing on industry restructuring scheduled for
January 5, the calendar is empty until the end of the month. On January 30,
a briefing by DOE on the high-level waste program has been tentatively
scheduled. The periodic briefing on operating reactors and fuel facilities
meeting on is tentatively set for January 31.

Watts Bar-1 Full Power License Briefing Still On Hold
   A commission briefing on the Tennessee Valley Authority's Watts Bar-1
full power license--one of the most important decisions facing the
commission in some time--could be put off until after Dicus is sworn in as
a commissioner and a legal quorum is restored.
   The NRC announced December 20 that a planned January 5 commission
briefing on the license would be rescheduled.
   NRC staffers said January 2 that a commission briefing on the Watts
Bar-1 license had been set tentatively for January 31, three days after
Rogers returns from a personal trip, but before Dicus's presumed
swearing-in at the beginning of February (Nucleonics Week, 4 Jan., 3).
However, NRC spokesperson Joe Gilliland said January 4 that a commission
briefing had not yet been set--even tentatively--on the matter. ``That date
may have just been set as a working assumption for the staff,'' Gilliland
said.
   Delaying a vote on the license would avoid a possible legal challenge to
a commission decision approving Watts Bar's full-power operation. A lawsuit
already is pending challenging the delegated authority procedure under
which Jackson has exercised the full power of the commission for six
months. In that case, intervenors challenging the Trump-S nuclear research
project at the University of Missouri sued over the procedure (INRC, 13
Nov. '95, 5).

NRC LAST MONTH TURNED DOWN A SUBMITTAL

   THE NRC LAST MONTH TURNED DOWN A SUBMITTAL BY PENNSYLVANIA POWER & LIGHT
Co. (PP&L) seeking a change in the quality assurance program. The change
request was submitted as a cost-beneficial licensing action (CBLA), but NRC
staffers said that changes to the quality assurance plan under 10 CFR
50.54(a) are not considered eligible for CBLAs.
   ``The submitted change proposes an elimination of the biennial procedure
review requirements for plant emergency operating procedures, off normal
procedures, emergency operating procedures, and other procedures of which
usage may be dictated by event,'' Michael Modes, chief of civil, mechanical
and materials engineering branch in the Division of Reactor Safety, wrote
in a December 15, 1995 letter to Robert Byram, senior vice president,
nuclear, of PP&L.
   Modes said the proposed change is a ``reduction in the commitment
previously accepted by the NRC,'' and added that if the change has already
been implemented, ``you must cease implementation.''

NRC NOTES IMPROVEMENTS, PERSISTENT PERSONNEL ERRORS AT FITZPATRICK

   The New York Power Authority received Category 2 ratings in all four
functional areas in NRC's latest systematic assessment of licensee
performance (SALP) at FitzPatrick. NRC Region I Administrator Thomas Martin
said NRC found good coordination and communication between plant and
corporate groups. He said, however, that despite some improvements as a
result of a number of initiatives, ``persistent personnel errors across
multiple parts of the organization demonstrated the need for continued
management attention.''
   According to Nucleonics Week, FitzPatrick, an 849-MW BWR, had a gross
capacity factor in 1994 of 69.25%. Through October 1995, the capacity
factor was 61.27%.
   In his letter to the utility, Martin noted the effectiveness of NYPA's
response to individual plant events and problems. He added, however, that
there were continued instances of ``a lack of a broad approach to event
investigations and root-cause determinations.''

NRC FINDS `SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT' IN OPERATIONS AT COMANCHE PEAK

   TU Electric received top Category 1 ratings in three functional
areas--operations, maintenance, and plant support--and a Category 2 rating
in the area of engineering in NRC's latest SALP review at Comanche Peak.
   NRC Region IV Administrator L.J. Callan said the utility's ``superior
performance in the operations area represented a significant improvement
and was marked by a strong safety focus, clear management support for
operations, effective communication of management expectations, and strong
management involvement in operator training.'' Callan, however, also noted
a decline in performance in the engineering area. The SALP board, Callan
said, ``considered the examples of less than thorough and timely evaluation
of problems which affect operations and the instances where equipment
performance information was not effectively tracked and used to improve
reliability by predicting and preventing challenges to the plant, including
those introduced from the balance-of-plant.''
   According to Nucleonics Week, Comanche Peak-1 and -2, both 1,161-MW
Westinghouse PWRs, had gross capacity factors in 1994 of 95.98% and 54.76%,
respectively. Through October 1995, the capacity factors were 78.48% and
94.40%, respectively.
   In the area of maintenance, Callan said NRC found ``an improvement in
plant material condition, the absence of significant maintenance worker
induced plant challenges, the reduction in the maintenance backlog, and a
healthy customer service philosophy.''

NRC FOUND CONTINUED STRONG PERFORMANCE

   NRC FOUND CONTINUED STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE OPERATIONS AREA AT
LIMERICK in a plant performance review (PPR) done December 5, 1995. NRC,
however, said that it was concerned about four scrams between August 8 and
September 11, 1995, as well as other transients experienced during the last
six months. In a letter to PECO Energy, NRC's Wayne Lanning, deputy
director of the division of reactor projects, noted that the utility's
``reviews have not found common contributing root causes, but we have noted
that you have developed a Focus on Excellence Through People Program to
address broad issues.''
   The PPR process consists of a review of inspection findings, significant
events and other information related to the integrated performance at a
nuclear plant. The purpose of the PPR process, NRC says, it to assess
performance trends and to plan future inspection activities. Another PPR
will occur later in the SALP cycle at Limerick, NRC said.

COOPER COMPLETES OUTAGE 22 DAYS LATE

   Major modifications to emergency diesel generators at Cooper last month
added another 22 days to the plant's refueling outage, costing the Nebraska
Public Power District (NPPD) roughly $2.2-million. The plant ended the
77-day refueling outage, which also included an in-service inspection of
the reactor vessel, on December 27.
   Terrence Reis, acting chief of reactor projects in NRC Region IV, said
last week that NPPD modified the diesel generators from a design that
needed a continuous supply of air to run to one that only needed an air
supply to start, similar to those used at all other nuclear generating
units in the U.S. Officials at both NRC and NPPD touted the modification as
one that would enhance plant safety. Cooper, once considered a
trouble-prone plant, is making a turn-around, according to NRC officials.
Reis said that NPPD officials admit that they underestimated the complexity
of the diesel generator modifications. He added that after some significant
problems with the work that NPPD quality assurance officials got very
``aggressive,'' making the modifications on the second generator go a lot
smoother.
   The diesel generator modifications, said Reis, are not related to the
Appendix R fire protection work done earlier. In November, NPPD crews found
that diesel generator modifications done in 1994 to meet NRC fire
protection rules actually would have made that equipment inoperable during
a control room fire (Nucleonics Week, 30 Nov. '95, 8). Crews had
incorrectly wired the control panel when they installed fuses in 1994 to
isolate five of the diesel generator indications on the control room
panel.

THREE UTILITIES SLAPPED WITH $50,000 FINES

   NRC started the new year by announcing $50,000 fines against each of
three utilities: Commonwealth Edison Co. (CECO), Baltimore Gas & Electric
Co. (BG&E), and the New York Power Authority (NYPA).
   NRC said that CECO had failed to correct a potential problem with
circuit breaker settings at Quad Cities. Managers at Quad Cities had been
told of a potential problem with the circuit breakers based on an incident
at CECO's Dresden plant, but failed to act, NRC said. The utility now is
planning plant modifications and procedure changes at Quad Cities.
   NRC staff identified a violation at BG&E's Calvert Cliffs involving lax
controls on unescorted access to the plant. A contractor employee was
granted unescorted access to the plant even though security staff at
Calvert Cliffs knew that the worker had been arrested under a different
name, NRC said. The worker's unescorted access permission later was revoked
when federal officials told BG&E that he was an illegal alien who had
fraudulently applied for a U.S. passport under another false name.
   NYPA was cited for four violations at Indian Point-3. The lapses
involved an October 15, 1995 incident in which the unit was taken from cold
shutdown to hot shutdown while switches controlling recirculation and
containment spray pumps were in the wrong position.
   The utilities have until February 1 to pay or contest the fines.

ENEL DIPS BELOW $34.00

Italy's ENEL has made awards to South African producers following its
recent tender and has done so at much lower levels than most predicted.
At what is believed to be $33.65 FOBT Richards Bay, basis 6,200kc GAR,
the price not only covers the tonnages award to the two successful
tenderers - Amcoal and Ingwe - but also the second year of two-year
contracts awarded a year ago to Shell and, again, Ingwe.

In all 2.5mt has been awarded plus 400,000t in options: under the new
tender, Amcoal gets 1mt including options and Ingwe 300,000t including
options while under the terms of last year's two-year contracts, Ingwe
will ship 700,000t and Shell 400,000t. Last year's prices were $32.50
for Ingwe and Shell and $32.60 for other South African suppliers.

Under the terms of the new awards, Amcoal will receive a two-year
contract with 1mt earmarked for 1997 and Ingwe's tonnage under the two
awards will be rolled together for a similar 1mt volume for next year.

Over the next two weeks ENEL will negotiate with the Colombian
producers it approached in its search for 500,000t. These include:
Carbocol, Intercor, Carbones del Caribe and Drummond. The settlement
price is expected to be in a $36-36.50 range basis 11,700/11,800
Btu/lb.

When all the tonnage is booked from these tenders, purchases will
proceed for Chinese, Polish and Venezuelan deliveries.

US exporters told ICR New Year's Week they expect Enel's tender for 1mt
of US coal "any day." It was originally scheduled for mid-December.
Delays are related to a change in spec: Enel plans to cut the sulfur
limit from 1.0% to 0.8% and the Btu minimum from 12,500 to 12,000. Ash
stays at 10%, which for southern Appalachian coals tends to correspond
to the previous higher Btu level, raising the question of Btu premiums.

Taiwan Power Corporation has started 1996 with a bang with two tenders
out and a decision imminent for Australian coal which looks like
setting a new low benchmark for its long-term contract buy-ins. The two
tenders include a second attempt to purchase a trial panamax of low
c.v. (4,500kc-5,500kc GAR), high moisture material for its Taichung
station, the tender closing on January 16. The second tender is for
five panamaxes for March and April delivery. Contact: Director of Fuel,
Taiwan Power, 9th Floor, 242 Roosevelt Road, Section 3, Taipei 100,
Taiwan. Phone: 886 2 366 6752; fax, 886 2 367 0597.

But it is reports of very low prices in four bids into a tender for a
long-term supplies from Australia which created something of a buzz
this week. The bids are from Camberwell, Saxonvale, Ulan and Coal and
Allied, spanning less than $2 from a low of just under $22.50 FOB. None
of the companies contacted said they had heard from Taipower about the
tender and suggested that prices quoted were lower than their actual
bids. The prices will be for the first year of deliveries in a seven-
year contract.

NATPOWER BUYS FOUR CAPES

National Power of the UK has booked four capes from the US for first
quarter delivery, bringing to well in excess of 1mt the company has
booked for 1996 delivery just from the US. The purchases, of mid-
sulphur material, have all been done a few cents higher than similar
purchases by the company in the Fall of 1995. They have helped to
produce a drying up of supplies of this quality coal from some US
suppliers. One cape is from the East Coast from AMCI - which had
already won 500,000t worth of business from NatPower; the balance is
coming through traders from the Gulf.

TRY SPOT, JAPANESE URGED

Japanese utilities should ditch their dependence on contract purchases
and increase the amount of spot tonnage bought, according to a study*
by the country's Institute of Energy Economics.

The study, comparing Japanese utility buying practices with those in
Europe, South Korea, and Taiwan, urges the utilities to become more
flexible for at least 1.8mt of their annual needs. This tonnage, 6% of
current demand, represents the fluctuations in annual consumption
caused by different weather conditions in recent years.

Tonnage fluctuations are likely to increase as coal stations shift
towards mid-loading and consequently, says the study, spot purchases
should move towards 10% of annual consumption.

In comparison with virtually no spot purchases by Japanese power
companies, European, Taiwanese and Korean powercos take 28-44%, 10-30%
and 10% respectively of their coal needs from the spot market.

The next few years will see Japanese coal stations drop their
utilisation from 65% today to about 59% in 1999 and even lower in
subsequent years, bringing Japanese coal station utilisation close to
those of Europe.

The IEE report sees no merit in current buying practices of including
option tonnages since they bring no benefit in lower prices. Since
Japanese power companies burn high-quality coals of well-known origin,
they are likely to enter the spot market initially through closed
tenders for specific brands. "But, if they hope to procure the cheapest
coal, they have to make open tender-based spot procurement as Taiwan
does," buying coal on physical properties alone, and buying coal which,
in some cases, has an unknown origin, says the IEE study.

TNEB AWARDS CONTRACTS

India's Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) has concluded 1996
contracts for a total of 2.4mt, having succeeded in getting the bidders
down to a level of $59.45/t CIF. This is higher than the low bid of
$49.00 submitted by PT Sarita Prima but significantly under all other
bids, which ranged from $64.85 to $73.25/t CIF Madras.

Several of the contract winners appear to be affiliated, based on their
offering the same coals. Glencore and Esteco each offered Cook,
Tselentis, and Prima Comex Indonesia; and Emirates Trading and Western
Shipping each offered Danau Mashitam, Shanxi, and Ensham. PT Sarita
Prima offered Berau and Bukit Asam, while Alagendran Exports offered a
range of Indonesian, South African, and Australian.

The two "unknowns" who won contracts last year along with Alagendran
and Emirates - Ocean Centre and Kerry Coal - have not reappeared on the
line up this time around (ICR 366/1).

KARNATAKA SEEKS 250,000T

Karnataka Power Corporation (KPC) is once again entering the
international market, this time looking for 250,000t. In its previous
attempt to import in 1993, the utility found the offers in response to
its 1mt tender technically and commercially unacceptable (ICR 353/13).

Karnataka is passing through a severe power crisis because of a strike
at Singarani Collieries in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh state since mid-
October. This has created shortages at Karnataka's only coal-fired
power station at Raichur. Hydro activity has also been poor.

Bids can be submitted by January 18 for delivery before May 31.

The bidders are being asked to quote in Indian rupees (the rupee has
declined 12% against the $ since October).

Further information can be obtained from Superintending Engineer (MM),
Karnataka Power Corporation Limited, 82 Shakti Bhavan, 3rd Floor, Race
Course Road, Bungalore - 560001, Karnataka, India. Telephone: +91-(0)80-

ANDHRA PRADESH COOLS TO IMPORTS

Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board (APSEB) may not place orders for
the 500,000t quantity it put to tender in September. The utility found
the offers it received at around Rs2,900/t cost three times the price
of domestic coal available from the coal mines in Andhra Pradesh.

The sharp decline in the Rupee value against the dollar in October-
November has further increased the delivery price of imports. Coupled
with the high price factor is the precarious financial position of the
APSEB board.

CHILGENER SETTLES 500,000T

Chilgener has settled a third of its 1.5mt requirement for 1996,
concluding with Colombian producers at competitive prices. Sources say
the buyer claims to have concluded at $34.00-35.00/t FOB basis 6,600kc
GAR.

The company plans to conduct talks with other suppliers over the next
month. It has inventories sufficient to last it until March and can
wait to conclude until late February.

Meanwhile, the Chilean utility has asked for bids on one or two trial
cargoes of western US and western Canadian coals. Offers are due
January 10. Observers say the company is looking to diversify supply
sources, given the rapid growth in its consumption.

CODELCO MAKES AWARDS

Chile's Codelco has awarded contracts for 1996 supplies for the
Tocopilla plant to companies in Canada, Australia, Colombia, and
Indonesia. Prices are believed to be up $4-5 over the previous levels,
but those prices were negotiated in September 1994, before last year's
market upswing. Sources said prices for all suppliers are in the range
of $40-42/t CFR basis 6300kc GAR. The price on the Indonesian coal is
believed to be $36.20/t CFR basis 5,400kc GAR.

Codelco officials told ICR they could not release any details until
contracts are formally concluded. Codelco is acting as purchasing agent
for the new owner of the privatised Tocopilla Division, now called
Central Termica Tocopilla.

Although Codelco had originally asked for bids on 280,000t for 1996 and
900,000t in 1997, it decided not to award any tonnage for the second
year. The volume was set at a higher level for 1997 because several
domestic contracts expire, leaving open the possibility of their
replacement with imports. One observer comments that prices may be
somewhat below market because bidders believed they were competing for
multi-year agreements.

Elsewhere in the Chilean market, P.T. Adaro has won an order for a test
cargo for Chilgener's Guacolda plant.

KIDECO SUPPLIES NEW INDONESIAN POWER PLANT

The South Korean owned coal mine PT Kideco Jaya Agung, in East
Kalimantan, has signed a long-term contract for supply to the
Indonesian private power plant PT Jawa Power. It will be Kideco's first
domestic supply contract. Currently all output is exported, mostly for
use by the South Korean power utility.

PT Jawa Power is in the very early stages of developing 2x600 MW plants
at Paiton in East Java, alongside the existing 2x400MW the existing
2x400 MW units now in operation and run by the state utility PT
Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), and the 2x615 MW units to be built by
the now celebrated private power company, PT Pation Energy Company.

Kideco, wholly Korean owned, (80% of which is by Korean state
agencies), and operating under a production sharing contract with the
Indonesian government, will supply 1.8mt/yr over 30 years to PT Jawa.
This matches the term of PT Jawa's operation, for which a power
purchase agreement with the PLN was signed in April 1995.

It is not yet known where the additional coal needed will come from,
but there are rumours that further supply may be secured from another
Kalimantan producer, PT Berau, which started production in 1994 from
its mines in north-eastern Kalimantan. Berau is a joint venture between
Nissho Iwai of Japan and PT United Tractors Indonesia.

In 1995, Kideco produced about 2.5mt all exported to South Korea.
Kideco said it would increase production to around 6mt by 1999. Kideco
began production from its mine south of Balikapapan in the second half
of 1993. Coal is shipped by road 40k to the Kideco run seaport of Tanah
Merah, which can accommodate bulk carriers of up to 40,000DWT.

PT Jawa is being built by a partnership made up of Siemens of Germany
(50%) PowerGen of Britain (35%) and the Indonesian PT Bumi Pertiwi
Tatapradipta (15%), a subsidiary of the Bimantara group, controlled by
president Suharto's second son, Bambang Trihadmojo.

TMT Coal has won an order to supply 36,000t to Savannah Electric &
Power for the purpose of testing the new unloading dock that is being
constructed to serve the Kraft plant. Delivery will be between March 1
and March 25.

TMT will supply Venezuelan coal produced by Carbosurco in the state of
Falcon. As earlier reported, TMT recently signed a contract to take
230,000t of Carbosurco's output for shipment out of Palmarejo on Lake
Maracaibo (ICR 388/12). Approximately 60% of the volume is earmarked
for one customer and the remainder is being sold on the spot market.

RBCT 1995 EXPORTS HIT 58.1MT

The Richards Bay Coal Terminal (RBCT) pulled out all the stops during
December to shift 5.58mt of coal and bring the total throughout for
calendar 1995 to 58.12mt. That compares with the calendar 1994 total
throughput of 53.5mt.

The official throughput target for 1995 issued by the RBCT was 56mt,
although members were told they6 could export coal up to their
respective quotas of a total RBCT throughput of 59mt. Reason for the
lower official target is that major exporters Ingwe and Amcoal - which
between them account for nearly two thirds of RBCT capacity - indicated
early in the year they did not have the coal available to meet
throughput rates equivalent to 59mt. Both groups said that they were
aiming for their shares of a throughput level of 56mt.

A number of the smaller RBCT shareholders made it clear they were not
constrained by such availability problems. It seems some have exported
at more than their proportionate share of 59mt by "buying-in" RBCT
quotas from other members unable to utilise their full entitlements.

Industry sources indicate the going rate for such deals varies between
US$1.5/t and $3/t, depending on market conditions.

It's early days for predictions on 1996 but the feeling in the industry
seems to be that a repeat performance of the 4.6mt growth shown in 1995
is unlikely. Reasons for this are worries over constraints on
production capacity at the various mines, most of which are at full
stretch already, combined with a degree of caution over the market.

The official RBCT line on export growth is that ideally, the members
would like to increase total throughput by about 2-2.5mt annually which
is also about the long-term average annual increase achieved in their
exports. Last year's 4.6mt jump in exports shows many SA exporters are
prepared to go all out to take advantage of favourable market
conditions when they present themselves. A similar performance this
year must, however, bring the RBCT to the limit of the capacity it can
provide through rationalisation and reorganisation of its operations at
minimal capital cost.

The RBCT's nominal capacity is currently stated at 60mt/yr. The
terminal's track record over the past few years has shown the RBCT's
"nominal capacity to be as long as the proverbial piece of string.
While the 60mt/yr number is therefore not a cap it is, however, very
close to what can be achieved without having to make a major capital
investment in expanding the terminal.

a decision on that unspecified investment by the members is pending to
push the terminal's capacity to 70mt. Industry executives comment
conventional wisdom is the RBCT should be exporting between 65mt and
70mt by 2000. Judging by 1995's performance it could be sooner than
that.

COLD WEATHER WARMS UK TRADE

Freezing conditions in North West Europe during December meant relief
for the beleagured UK house coal trade. After a run of mild winters,
capped by an appalling 1994/95 in which trade fell by 20-30% to an
annual rate of well below 2mt/yr, sales were very low throughout 1995.
This reflected high carryover stocks from the winter and structural
changes within the industry.

The structural changes followed the privatisation of British Coal in
December 1994. RJB Mining, the lead producer in the newly privatised
world, made its priority in this sector a deliberate targeting of
import markets, offering heavily discounted supplies in northern
Scotland to challenge longstanding Polish contracts. It also pursued
direct sales to merchants, which had traditionally been supplied by
factors. Merchants, confronted with increasing competition between
different suppliers and between suppliers and factors, had another
reason to hold back from purchasing.

By October, which was the warmest in the UK on record, there were signs
of panic within the industry because coal was still not moving and
balance sheets were already in the red. By this time, two of the
leading factors were changing hands with Coal Products, itself newly
privatised, buying Anglo Coal from Anglo United and the management of
British Fuels just about to secure their company from British Coal. The
management of the third biggest factor, PD Fuels which is owned by
Powell Duffryn, gained exclusivity to bid for their company just before
Christmas.

After the bitterly cold weather of December, traders are now talking of
shortages developing for some grades. They point out that many effects
of the cold snap are yet to be felt because it hit in the middle of a
holiday period when fires were on all of the time.

Another cold snap will surely bring another surge in sales. There is
already a shortage of 50mm plus sized material and of singles. As one
trader put it, "if you had some Colombian product at the moment you'd
sell thousands of tonnes of it, the trouble is none of us has". Given a
lead time of c. 35 days to bring in a typical 35-40,000t consignment
for processing and the fact that the coldest months in the UK are
normally January and February, only those with coal already on the way
or at European stockpiles will be able to respond on time to meet
demand.

close to $37.00/t FOB basis 12,000 Btu/lb. One will be delivered in
each half of 1996. The purchase completes EdF's requirement for the

The price is $1.00 less than deals done two or three months ago for US
coal of equivalent quality to EdF. The French company bought from

GERMAN IMPORTS ROSE 3% IN 1995

Coal and coke imports into Germany increased by only around 3% in 1995
to 18mt, according to the German Coal Importers Federation. The border
price for imported steam coal into Germany averaged DM76t ($53.10)/t
hard coal equivalent during the first 10 months of 1995, just over one
quarter of the price of German coal - DM291/thce - before subsidies
took effect.

In 1996, the importers anticipate that, assuming there are no
significant currency swings, imported coal prices will remain stable
and cheap. It seems contradictory therefore that the volume of imports
is expected to fall by around 10% in 1996. The reason is that many
large consumer utilities have generous coal stocks, the hangover in
volumes from their obligation to buy German coal under the now-lapsed
Jahrhundert contract which were larger than their actual needs.

These companies will draw down their stocks in 1996, reducing purchases
of fresh coal by as much as 10%. German and imported coal are expected
to be affected to the same degree.

Ruhrkohle announced at the end of last year that sales would reach an
average 27mt a year over the next three years, resulting in an excess
production capacity of 2-3mt. Saarberg expects to sell only around 7mt
in 1996 instead of the originally anticipated 8.2mt.

The coal importers association warns against what it considers over-
estimates of coal sales for this year and beyond by politicians
responsible for German coal policy. The consultancy Prognos in Basel,
in particular, is criticised as having given too optimistic a picture
of coal's future market position in its recent energy forecast for the
Federal economy ministry. The development of steam coal use for
electricity generation is especially overrated, say the importers.

BAYERNWERK PLANS 0.3MT IMPORTS.

Saarberg, Germany's second largest coal producer, signed a five-year
coal supply contract with major utility Bayernwerk on December 21 1995,
just days before the 15-year Jahrhundert contract expired at the close
of the year. The deal covers 2.3mt, 0.46mt/a year.

Bayernwerk signed up for coal from Ruhrkohle for 1996-2000 back in July
last year. The contract was for nearly 4mt, a little under 0.8mt per
year. The utility has thus made a firm commitment to use around 1.26mt
of German coal a year. Stocks standing at 0.5mt at the end of 1995 will
also be drawn down.

Furthermore, after two years of using only Germany coal, in 1996
Bayernwerk will import 0.3mt.

Delivery of the imports by water is restricted due to the limited
unloading facilities at the power stations, so the utility buys only
part cargos of 15,000t. Rail deliveries from Poland and the Czech
Republic are more or less continuous week-by-week throughout the year.

AL NASR BIDS SHOW RISES

Opening bids into Egypt's Al Nasr Company of Coke and Chemicals tender
for Australian coals show 5-6% increase on last year's prices. BHP
(Blackwater) and South Blackwater - who supplied under the previous
contract - have bid $47.75 and $47.20 FOB respectively, compared with
last year's price of around $46.

Two newcomers bidding for the Al Nasr "standard high vol" are
Glencore's Cook and KCC's Tahmoor - Glencore close to the traditional
suppliers' prices, KCC for substantially more. All bidders are going
for the full 400,000t on offer which in the case of Cook shows a
remarkable turnaround; only a year ago it was producing just 275,000t.

A second blend is being called for by Al Nasr for 100,000t of lower
vol, lower ash material. One explanation for this development is that
the buyer is seeking an alternative to one of its US coals. MIM (Oaky
Creek) and BHP (Saraji blend) are both going for the full 100,000t
offered.

Traditionally, Al Nasr has come back seeking better prices, although
the fact that it is tendering in the middle of the JSM negotiations
would suggest that few are going to oblige with lower offers with so
much at risk. Decision expected in February. The new contracts will run
for four years commencing on April 1 this year.

The CIF Alexandria prices reveal a wide range of freight estimates ($11-
16.40) suggesting that some suppliers are very keen to get the business
without posting damaging FOB numbers. Alexandria takes panamaxes with
the alternative cape port, El Dikela, sometimes being used.

COALARBED, ISCOR EXPAND TONNAGE

CoalArbed has won new multi-year contracts to supply 250,000t/yr out of
Baltimore to South Africa's Iscor. The tonnage is in addition to the
more than 700,000t that CoalArbed supplied in 1995 under long-term
deals.

CoalArbed will supply mid-vol coking coal from two Pennsylvania
producers, Bradford Coal and K & J Coal. Neither company has been
active in direct sales to export customers in recent years, although
Bradford formerly supplied Pakistan Steel through Hansen Coal.

Both companies have operations in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania,
served by Conrail for shipment through the Consol Coal Pier. They are
strip operations in the Kittanning and Freeport seams with typical
volatile content of 26-27%, according to sources.

Representatives of Iscor were in the US in December to visit mines. The
steel company has been increasing its import tonnage because of
declining reserves at the captive Hlobane colliery and because it wants
to improve coke quality when it adds pulverised coal injection this
year (ICR 365/7). At the moment, the company would take higher import
volumes but is reportedly held back by capacity limitations of its
discharge equipment.

CoalArbed has been supplying Iscor with southern Appalachian coals from
producers such as Consol and Pittston for shipment out of Hampton
Roads. The new contracts represent the first deals out of Baltimore.
But although Iscor's import requirement could rise to nearly 2mt/yr
after 2000, it is expected to cut its US take when it goes ahead with
developing an operation in Queensland at Moranbah, where it is
currently undertaking exploration work.

GERMAN COKERS TO IMPORT 1.3MT.

Backdated to the beginning of 1995, a deal was finally signed shortly
before Christmas by German steel companies and Ruhrkohle allowing the
import of an additional 1.3mt of coking coal a year (ICR 385/2).

The steel companies which operate coking plant - Thyssen Stahl, HKM and
Preussag Stahl will together import between 0.7mt and 0.8mt of coking
coal annually. Thyssen will probably have an import entitlement of
around 0.5mt with the other two mills sharing the rest. Ruhrkohle will
import about 0.5mt, rather more than the figure of 0.32mt circulating
in November last year.

The volumes have been fixed only verbally as they depend on the amount
of coke breeze produced in each company's coking plant. This in turn
can be varied under various technical conditions. Also, for a limited
period, Thyssen will give up a part of its share to the other two
mills.

(The link with coke breeze hinges on the fact that the coking coal
equivalent to the breeze is not eligible for subsidy under the rules of
the Huette Contract.)

The steel companies now allowed to import coking coal will, it seems,
derive no significant financial benefit from the deal as Ruhrkohle
already supplies all coking coal at more or less world market prices.
However the mills will have the opportunity to "practise" with world
market coking coal in preparation for the moment when the door is
finally opened to unrestricted coking coal imports.

This could be in 2002 when the Huette contract expires or earlier if
the German government decides to screw back coking coal subsidies
sooner.

Backdating the agreement to beginning 1995 means that imports by
Thyssen, HKM and Ruhrkohle last year will be covered by the deal.
Preussag however will start importing this year for the first time.

AUSTRALIA SHIPS 137MT

A survey of port throughput in Australia shows that the country lifted
exports from 131.2mt to 136.7mt. Port Kembla was the only port to see a
significant fall, dropping 1.5mt to 10.8mt. Four ports moved over 20mt -
 Gladstone, Hay Point, Dalrymple Bay and Newcastle which rose 3.4mt to
48.9mt.

The stock situation tightened during November, largely through
industrial action, cutting exports stocks from 11.5mt to 11.5mt. A
further fall was predicted for December because of production problems
in Queensland caused by high rainfall. All the fall was in coking coal
which dropped 1.2mt.

BSM NAME SAD COORDINATOR

Once again, the Brazilian steel mills have nominated Helio Sad of
Usiminas as the chief negotiator for this year's coking coal contracts.
Talks are expected to start in late February after Carnival.

It should be noted that although the mills do much of their negotiating
as a bloc, the recent moves of CST to modify or cancel existing
contracts were the actions of that company on its own.

CST STUNS SUPPLIERS

Brazil's CST has astonished the industry by sending out a letter to all
of its coal suppliers asking for a price reduction on existing
contracts. In the case of certain suppliers, CST has followed up with a
second communication saying it is cancelling its contracts with those
companies.

The initial letter went out mid-December from CST's new chief raw
materials buyer, Coletano Abreu. It asked for price cuts of $4.00/t on
coals priced more than $40.00 and cuts of $3.00 on coals between $30.00
and $40.00, both to be effective January 15. At the same time, CST sent
letters to iron ore producer CVRD asking for a 10% cut and to shipping
company Doce Nave also asking for 10%.

The company said it was forced to take the measure because of a 25-30%
drop in sales of steel slabs, its only product. CST is believed to be
under pressure from its leading bank which, like many banks in Brazil,
is going through a bad period due to the lack of inflationary gains
under the new currency system.

Suppliers have universally responded to this message by saying it is
not possible. One major supplier told ICR, "We sent back a very polite
letter saying that we appreciate where they're coming from, but when we
run into bad times we bite the bullet and we expect the customer to do
the same."

The informal reaction, however, has been far from polite. The
implications of such a move are obvious, as the modification of formal
contracts in progress would call into question the whole framework of
agreements in the market. CST's action has reportedly been as unpopular
elsewhere in Brazil as it has with the suppliers, as buyers at the
other mills worry their credibility will be undermined. According to
sources outside CST, it is also highly unpopular with members of the
company's raw materials purchasing staff whose experience in the coal
market is far more extensive than that of the newcomer Abreu.

As mentioned above, the initial price cut request was followed by a
message to selected high-vol suppliers indicating their contracts were
actually being cancelled. This message, sent out December 28, stated:
"Due to substantial changes in our coal blending, as a consequence of
drastic administrative measures because of declining slab prices in the
international market, we are cancelling the balance of our contracts."
   It wasn't clear at press time which companies were the lucky
recipients of this second message. Some sources said, however, they
believed CST was attempting to cut back on US high-vol because it had
recently taken increased volumes of high-vol from Canada's Devco.

SHELL RINGS THE CHANGES

Shell Coal International has replaced Peter de Wit in his position as
vice president, supply and trading, with Mike Sweeney, previously
general manager for Asia, America and for metallurgical coal. De Wit
moves to a new post involving coal and gas supplies.

Meanwhile, in Australia, Shell is advertising for two traders. One is
to join its Shell Australia team in Sydney under Lindsay Flint, the
other to work with David Heap, the Shell Coal International executive
based there. The latter is effectively a relocation of a London-based
job, probably to Sydney or Jakarta.

C&L SURVEY DETAILS COLLAPSE IN NSW PROFITABILITY

Fiscal 1994/95 was a monetary disaster for the New South Wales coal
industry with the aggregate after tax profit falling by A$100m ($74.4m)
from the previous year to just A$98m, according to the annual survey
conducted by Cooper & Lybrand. However, it is expected that the
performance of the industry will show a marked improvement this year,
and in 1996/97 with the expectation of further price rises this year.

There is now a degree of optimism in the industry, given the higher
prices and continuing increases in productivity, the director of the
NSW Minerals Council and CEO of Peabody Resources, Bob Humphris, said.
Although the latest Coopers & Lybrand survey is now just over six
months out of date, (it covers the 1994/95 FY), it does show the
immense damage caused by the savage price cuts forced by the Japanese
buyers for JFY 1994.

Twenty one companies took part in the survey representing about 80% of
NSW production. This grew by 8% to about 67.5mt in the year, of which a
little more than 50% was won from underground operations. Domestic
demand remained static and all of the additional 5.1mt found its way
into export markets which increased to close to 50mt. Operating profit
after tax but before abnormal and extraordinary items averaged only
A$1.45/t less than half the A$3.19/t profit for the previous financial
year.

If extraordinary and abnormal items are included, the meagre profit is
all but wiped out. The aggregate bottom line result for last financial
year for all the companies surveyed was only A$3m which suggests that,
in all probability, a relatively large percentage of the respondents
traded in the red.

The Minerals Council, as always, has been quick to point out that the
governments' take of coal industry revenue was much higher than that
received by the producers. Total government revenue grew from A$12.14/t
in 1993/94 to A$12.43/t. The figure includes services provided, notably
rail freights, as well as income tax. A breakdown of the total payments
to the state and federal governments suggest that NSW is getting its
act together on becoming a more efficient provider of services.
Provision of government services fell from A$396m in 1992/93 to A$336m
in 1993/94 and to A$312m last financial year - a 24% drop in three
years. This was achieved despite the fact that tonnages moved rose by
almost 9% last year. Capital investment in 1994/95, mirroring industry
optimism, rose to A$625m from $485m the year before and it is estimated
that it will rise further to around A$700m this financial year. It is
also likely that capital expenditure will remain strong for the
remainder of this decade as producers gear up for the anticipated
increase in demand. Most of this will be met through brownfields
expansion, Humphris said. The survey also includes a comparison of data
from a constant group of respondents whose production rose from 60.9mt
to 61.8mt in the last couple of years although employment levels fell
by almost 800 from 12,064 to 11,272. The constant group also performed
better financially than all the respondents with the after tax
operating profit before abnormals and extraordinaries being A$106m
compared with A$210 the previous year.

The Minerals Council has also released data compiled by the Joint Coal
Board and the Reserve Bank which shows that employment levels for the
entire industry continue to fall. These dropped 8.6% in 1992/93 to
14,458, a further 5.2% to 13,701 in 1993/94 and a further 0.6% to
13,612 last financial year. At the same time, output per employee is
rising steadily - up 7.7% three years ago to 5,580t a man year followed
by a 6.5% rise in 1993/94 to 5,940t and a further 6% increase last year
to 6,440t.

Consequently, the labour cost per tonne produced dropped 4.5% in
1992/93, 4.2% in 1993/94 and 2.5% last year to A$10.39.

CONSOL, RHEINBRAUN TALK BUYOUT

DuPont is negotiating with Rheinbraun parent RWE to sell its remaining
50% share in leading US producer Consol, according to reliable sources.
The two sides held a series of pre-Christmas meetings in London to work
out the details of the buyout, but are still talking over valuation,
ICR understands.

The crux of the matter, apparently, is that Rheinbraun does not expect
to pay as much for the second half of the company as it did for the
first half. The German company paid an estimated $1.25bn for its
initial share in 1991 (ICR 270/6).

A Consol spokesman said he could not comment on acquisition rumours.
From Germany, RWE chief Dietmar Kuhnt issued a statement confirming
that DuPont wants to sell its stake in Consol and saying that RWE will
look for another partner or partners to replace DuPont.

Expectations have been high this fall that DuPont would soon sell its
share in Consol. The company has made no secret that it considers coal
to be a non-core asset. One source points out that reports of a
divestiture have been widespread since former DuPont chairman Edgar
Woolard said the company intended to buy back shares owned by Seagram
and to fund that with a sale of Consol.

In connection with the RWE-DuPont negotiations, there have also been
rumours that a third party will take a minority share in Consol. The
name of Cyprus Amax has come up in this connection, but it should be
remembered that Cyprus has been mentioned as a prospective buyer of
virtually every property on the block for the past six months. One
observer notes that a part-ownership of Consol by Cyprus Amax would be
illogical from an operational point of view as it would "paralyse" the
two competitors.

CONSOL ANNOUNCES REORGANISATION

Consol will eliminate three regional mining offices in a major
reorganisation resulting in the loss of an estimated 200-300 jobs. Also
at Consol, company president William Karis will take over Bobby Brown's
position as CEO, while Brown will stay with Consol to focus on
"strategic issues."

In the reorganisation, Consol will shut down its mining offices in
Washington, Pennsylvania; Morgantown, West Virginia; and St. Louis,
Missouri. Functions handled at these mid-level offices will be
transferred either to company headquarters in Pittsburgh or to the
mining operations themselves, a spokesman told ICR.

"We are trying to update our structure to reflect the character of our
company in 1995," the spokesman said. "The structure was put in place
in 1975, but we mine fifty percent more coal than we did 20 years ago
with fifty percent fewer mines."

The change will be effective as of February. There have also been
rumours that some of Consol's regional sales offices will close, but
the spokesman said he was not aware of any such plan.

Regarding Brown's new role, the company did not define the "strategic
issues" he will deal with, but his responsibilities may be related to
an upcoming change in ownership. The shift of the CEO position from
Brown to Karis follows a transfer of the president position from the
former to the latter in 1995.

AEP, COGENTRIX FORM VENTURE

American Electric Power, the largest coal-burning power company in the
US, has formed a joint venture with independent power company Cogentrix
and with Zurn Industries of Erie, Pennsylvania. The venture, called
Industrial Energy Partners, will focus on building IPPs selling
electricity beyond AEP's own service area, possibly including overseas.

The announcement was made in December at a power conference in
California. It reflects a decision by Ohio-based AEP to take advantage
of the deregulation of the US electricity industry. The venture
involves a non-utility subsidiary called AEP Resources, one of several
unregulated entities recently formed by AEP to pursue new power-related
markets. The parent company controls utilities in seven states in the
midwest burning about 45m short tons (st)/yr.

Cogentrix is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, and operates
power projects in the US and overseas. It operates 10 plants in the US
and is currently working toward development of a $1.4bn power plant in
Mangalore, India.

Zurn is a manufacturer of equipment for power generation. It has
designed and built more than 40 generating stations over the past 10
years that are fuelled by natural gas or waste products.

PEN OWNERSHIP CHANGES

The evolution of an independent US producer continues with Pen
Holdings' announcement this week that controlling interest in the
company's common stock was sold to William Beckner January 3. Beckner
has been the company's president and chief executive officer since 1993
and has held various executive positions since 1982.

Pen, a privately held company located in Brentwood, Tennessee, was
originally formed in 1971 by Eddie Pen, who died February 6, 1993. His
wife, Grace Pen, has served as chairman of the company's board of
directors since his death. The sale was effected by Grace Pen and the
other co-executors of Pen's estate.

The company was originally known as P&C Bituminous Coal and was created
by Pen largely to do business with Taiwan Power. However, the company's
long-term contract supplies to Taipower have declined in volume at the
same time it has shifted toward domestic markets as well as export
markets outside Taiwan.

Pen has total revenues of more than $200m per year and employs 500
people. Its two largest subsidiaries are Pen Coal Corp. and Elk Horn
Coal, which control about 200m short tons of reserves in east Kentucky
and southern West Virginia.

Ruhrkohle International, a subsidiary of Ruhrkohle Handel, the trading
arm of German coal producer Ruhrkohle, wants to increase its share in
Australia's German Creek from around 12% to at least 20%.

Ruhrkohle International continues to scout the world for other
interesting investment possibilities. Any acquisitions are likely to be
small however after the investment of several hundred million DMs in
Venezuela since "Ruhrkohle is not a company with enormous financial
resources." Only those of the German state.

CHINESE COKE SALES REACH 7MT

The rapid growth in Chinese coke exports could approach 9mt for the
whole of 1995, easily more than double 1994 sales. In October exports
hit a new monthly record with 890,000t shipped, bringing to 7.05mt the
volume moved in the first 10 months of the year (3.13mt in January
October 1994. Prices, according to Chinese customs authorities, reached
$80.52/t FOB compared with $67.39 a year previously.

Coal exports also look to be heading for another record year with
22.44mt moved in the first 10 months compared with 18.34mt in the same
1994 period.

sector. Of the few spot fixtures reported, since just before Christmas,
capes from the US Atlantic to ARA ranged around $6.00. A cape in the
Pacific fetched $5.15 for a shipment from Queensland to South Korea.
The only Colombian business reported was for a 60,000t shipment from
Puerto Bolivar to Wedel in Germany at $11.25, whilst there was no
Richards Bay loading fixtures reported.

UMW INAUGURATES ROBERTS

The United Mine Workers of America swore in its new president, Cecil
Roberts, December 22. Roberts succeeds Richard Trumka in leading the US
miners' union and is expected to take an aggressive stance in
attempting to reverse the union's declining representation in the
industry.

Roberts has been active in the UMW since the 1970s and became a
leading figure in the 1989 Pittston strike while serving as vice
president of the union's District 17. He has worked as a coal miner
since 1971.

DONG/AMERADA PROBE NEW DANISH N SEA GASLINE

Denmark's state owned Dansk Olie og Naturgas (Dong) and Amerada Hess
A/S, local unit of US Amerada Hess Corp, are jointly investigating a
possible DKr1.5-2.5bn ($270.7-451m) new gas transport system in the
Danish North Sea, potentially tapping Norwegian and UK supplies as well
as Danish gas.  The move follows acceptance by Dong of an Amerada
proposal to participate in a joint study of the technical and economic
feasibility of building a new system.  Faced with rapidly growing
natural gas demand in Denmark Dong is currently investigating further
gas supplies.

Dong already owns the existing pipeline system transporting natural gas
from Central Graben fields in the southwestern Danish North Sea to
shore on the west coast of Jutland.  Announcing the new investigation
late last month, Amerada noted the existing system has an annual
transport capacity of about 7.5 Bcm.  This corresponds to the total
amount of gas Dansk Undergrunds Consortium, hitherto Dong's sole
supplier, is able to deliver to Dong from 1997.  "With these deliveries
the existing gas transport system will be nearing its capacity," said
Amerada.

"From the turn of the century, Dong expects to be able to sell
additional gas in the region of two billion cubic metres per annum
which entails securing new gas supplies.  Taken together, this means
that there is a need for a new system which will also give improved
security of supply for the Danish market."  Amerada is an operator and
participant in several exploration licences in the Danish sector while
Dong is a part owner, with a typical 20% share in all licences awarded
since 1984.

Amerada says it expects to start Danish sector production soon, with
one discovery for which it has expectations being the South Arne field
in licence 7/89.  This saw a promising production test earlier last
year.  "A new gas transport system would be able to gather gas from
both South Arne as well as other smaller fields and could also be
linked to the Norwegian system," said Amerada.  Amerada and Dong would
"in appropriate circumstances" seek cooperation with other field
owners.

Some of these smaller fields would not be economic if they had to bear
the costs of a transport infrastructure on their own, said Amerada.
"Apart from transporting gas from any smaller Danish fields there may
also be a possibility to transport gas to Denmark from the UK, German
and Norwegian sectors.  Depending on which technical solution is the
most attractive, the transport system would require an investment of
approximately 1.5-2.5bn Danish Kroner (C.#170-280 million)."

The accompanying map (see hard copy) shows the existing transport
systems for oil and natural gas from Danish Undergrunds Consortium's
fields in the Central Graben in the southwestern Danish North Sea.  The
dotted line indicates a potential new transport sytem for natural gas
emanating from the South Arne field in the western Danish North Sea.
Amerada notes there are unutilised fields on Danish as well as on
German, English and Norwegian territory.

BP/SONATRACH IN ALGERIAN GAS PUSH ON EUROPE

BP just before Christmas announced signing of a major potential $3.5bn
gas deal with Algerian state oil and gas firm Sonatrach which marks a
key new strategic phase in Algeria's push for future gas sales in
Europe and a major advance for BP's ambitions to boost its
international gas business. The two companies signed an agreement to
explore for and produce gas in the remote Sahara Desert and,
particularly significantly, to market it jointly in Europe, notably
southern Europe.

Algerian industry and energy minister Ammar Makhloufi said the BP deal
could be a model for other similar projects; Exxon is reportedly to
start negotiations on a possible natural gas deal close to the BP
location. Algeria's bloody struggle between Islamic militants and
government security forces has not so far deterred energy firms; while
the bulk of oil and gas fields are in the south of the country most
violence has been in the north.

Commenting on the new deal, BP chief executive John Browne said: "This
is a landmark agreement which could increase BP's worldwide gas
production by 30%. It is the first major gas joint venture a foreign
company has signed with Sonatrach, the sole gas producer in Algeria for
the past 30 years. It has the potential to open up a new area of gas
production in Algeria and, from the next decade onwards, to give
European consumers greater choice in their sources of gas supply."

Under the deal, which follows two years of negotiations, BP will
initially appraise known gas finds and search for additional reserves
in the In Salah region of District 3 some 1,200 km south of Algiers.
The licence area is about 25,000 sq km or 20% of the total District 3
area and BP said the area was believed to be capable of producing about
10 Bcm/yr of gas by the early part of the next century; the area has
yielded no liquids to date and they are not expected.

Present BP global gas output is about 13 Bcm/yr, most in the North Sea.
Current estimates are that the Algerian licence area holds about 10 Tcf
split equally between existing finds and future discoveries. Subject to
proving sufficient reserves, gas would be transported north via a new
pipeline (see map in hard copy) to link with Algeria's existing
pipeline system and then onwards by pipe to Europe to be marketed
jointly by a new company to be owned 50:50 by BP and Sonatrach. First
gas is looked for about 2002-2003.

BP said it was planning to spend about $100m on an initial two to three
year appraisal and exploration programme and later investment decisions
would be needed for subsequent stages of the project. The deal requires
approval of the European Union as well as ratification by Algerian
authorities. BP Exploration chief executive Rodney Chase said BP would
shortly start seismic work in the In Salah region and was planning to
drill nine appraisal and exploration wells to establish location and
size of known reserves and to find new fields. The licence area holds
seven known gasfields and 750 sq km of 3D seismic will be shot over
these, plus drilling of five appraisal wells. A separate exploration
area in the licence has a work programme of 2,000 sq km of 2D seismic
and four exploration wells

Depending on success of this initial phase, full development would
require construction of a 520 km, 48-inch diameter pipeline to take gas
to Hassi R'Mel, Algeria's gas hub, linking up to the new Maghreb
gasline to Spain and the TransMed system to Italy, and then on to
market. LNG export is not envisaged. Pipeline construction could cost
up to $1,000m, with full cost of the project estimated at some $3,500m
over a five year period. BP would fund 65% of this investment and
Sonatrach the remainder. BP is expected to get about 30% of net profits
over the full 20-30 year life of the project. The pipeline is big
enough to carry gas from other concessions.

NIGERIA LNG SEALS MAJOR CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT

Nigeria LNG Ltd (NLNG) late last year turned a deaf ear to continued
international calls for reprisals against Nigeria's military regime for
its execution of minority Ogoni activists (IGR 289/21) and kept the
long delayed Bonny LNG project on the rails with final award of the
main project construction contract. The company said the move started
the final phase of the project which main foreign partner Shell noted
has so far taken 30 years to bring to fruition. The lump sum turnkey
contract, reportedly worth about $3bn, has been confirmed to a
contracting consortium of France's Technip, Italian Snamprogetti, MW
Kellogg of the US and Japan's JGC.

It covers engineering, procurement and construction for the
liquefaction plant at Finima, Bonny Island, together with associated
facilities and the gas transmission system to collect natural gas from
producers. NLNG said the contractors were "obliged to ensure maximum
Nigerian input during construction and to follow strict regulations to
ensure environmental impact protection". Shell, holder of 25.6% of the
project and technical leader, said until now there had been no way to
dispose of large volumes of associated gas produced with oil in the
Delta region.

If the construction contract had not been signed by end-1995 a complex,
interdependent series of other contracts, including contracts for
export of Nigerian gas, would have collapsed, terminating the LNG
project with little hope of revival. It again stressed the benefits of
the project for jobs and the environment - through cuts in gas flaring -
 and that no dividends would accrue to shareholders, which include the
Nigerian state, until after 2007.

Shell Development Co of Nigeria managing director Brian Anderson said:
"We recognise there have been calls for the project to be halted as a
gesture of political protest. We respect these views and understand the
concerns they reflect. But we cannot accept that this would-contribute
to the good of Nigeria." Other partners in NLNG are Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp with a 49% stake, France's Elf with 15% and Italy's Agip
with 10.4%.

MAJOR ITALY-NORWAY GAS DEAL FLAGGED

Agreement appears imminent in negotiations on a supply deal to
establish Norway as a major source of natural gas for Italy. Antonio
Badini, Italian ambassador in Oslo, is quoted in the weekly Mondo
Economico as saying: "It's now a question of several weeks, the time
for settling the last details." The agreement was said by the magazine
to provide for the Eni group's Snam to import 10-12 Bcm/yr from the
Norwegian North Sea for an annual value of L1,500bn ($940m). It would
run for 20 years, from 1999/2000. The magazine added that Norwegian
commerce minister Gete Knudsen discussed the matter on a recent visit
to Italy.

The Eni group gives no further details than those already disclosed by
Snam. The negotiations, Snam said last month, are with the GFU
consortium of Norwegian producers and the gas would be landed at
Dunkerque, France under arrangements with Gaz de France. A pipeline
would have to be laid across French territory to bring the gas to
Montcenis on the Italian border. Little has been made known about the
pipeline scheme and various aspects are reported still under discussion
such as whether it would be owned by Gaz de France alone or jointly
with Snam.

The advantage for Snam is that in Norway it will gain a secure major
source, at much lower political risk than the two existing leading
suppliers, Algeria and Russia. It already imports lesser quantities
from a low risk source, Holland, but here the availability is limited.

PTT PLANS THAI WEST/EAST GASLINE

The Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) is embarking on a 7.27bn baht
($290.8m) investment project for a new natural gas pipeline spanning
from Thailand's western region to the east. The new gasline, 28 inches
in diameter and 200 km long, will be laid from Ratchaburi province to
link with PTT's existing gas grid at the Bangkok South Power plant in
Samut Prakan and Wang Noi in Ayutthaya. According to PTT, the west-to-
east line is geared to respond to greater natural gas demand by
industries and future power stations operated by independent power
producers (IPPs) along the route.

The gasline will form an integral part of the larger pipeline, 42
inches in diameter and 300 km long, to be laid from the Thai-Burmese
border at Kanchanaburi province to a 1,800 MW combined cycle plant to
be built by Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat). The
Kanchanaburi-Ratchaburi gasline, estimated to cost 16.5bn baht, will
transport natural gas from Burma's offshore Yadana and Yetagun
gasfields to Thailand. PTT has just received Cabinet endorsement for
investing in the two gasline projects. The west-to-east pipeline is
scheduled operational in 1999, a year after expected completion of the
Kanchanaburi-Ratchaburi stretch.

At present, PTT, the Thai state oil and gas firm, is selecting
companies to provide engineering consultancy services for the
Kanchanaburi-Ratchaburi gasline project, PTT officials said. Meanwhile,
the Cabinet has signalled a green light for PTT to proceed with a
1.47bn baht investment in another gas pipeline scheme - a 24-inch, 100
km stretch - from Tantawan gasfield in the Gulf of Thailand to tie in
with PTT's Gulf grid. The approval came after PTT sealed an agreement
with the group led by US-based Pogo Producing for long-term natural gas
supply from Tantawan. The Tantawan gasline is scheduled complete at end-
1997, before starting delivery of 100 MMcfd to PTT (IGR 287/18).

SYRIAN GAS OUTPUT POISED TO DOUBLE

Plans have been put together that will see a doubling of Syrian gas
production by 2000. A recent study into reserves and prospects leads
the oil ministry to give the green light to projects aimed at utilising
a flow of over 16 MMcmd. Four schemes will make this possible, the
biggest being the start of production from fields near Palmyra. These
are due to start up at 3 MMcmd when first-stage development is
completed in 1996. A second stage development will double that to 6
MMcmd during 1997.

Also near Palmyra will be Marathon's oilfield development, expected to
yield some 1.1 MMcmd of associated gas by 2000. Final scheme involves
expansion of production and processing capacity at the Jbeissah
gasfield, where output will rise from 1.7 MMcmd now to 2.5 MMcmd.

Getting this new gas to market will involve laying of 1,160 km of new
pipeline. Utilisation will come mainly from new power plants such as
that at al-Zara (IGR 289/22), fertiliser production, refinery use, iron
and steel production and general industrial use. By 2000, these will
absorb 12.85 MMcmd. Distribution through domestic grids will take 3.5
MMcmd.

GADONNEIX TAKES HELM AT GAZ DE FRANCE

Pierre Gadonneix has succeeded Loik le Floch-Prigent as president of
Gaz de France (GdF). The latter - who has socialist credentials as well
as a reputation for competent management - was sent in to pacify state
railway company Societe Nationale de Chemins de Fer (SNCF) whose
employees were at the vanguard of the recent wave of French strikes. It
was third time lucky for Gadonneix, appointed general manager of GdF in
July 1987. In 1988, when Jacques Fournier left, Gadonneix saw Francis
Gutmann get the top job. In 1993, le Floch-Prigent was appointed over
his head.

Choice of the highly qualified Gadonneix - who has a doctorate from the
Harvard Business School, as well as attending France's elite technical
university Ecole Polytechnique, and the specialised Ecole Nationale
Superieure du Petrole et des Moteurs - also contrasts with the recent
politically motivated appointment of Edmond Alphandery at the head of
GdF's sister organisation Electricite de France. But like Alphandery,
Gadonneix will take part in nominating his deputy, which will
strengthen his presidential authority. Among names being mentioned for
the general manager's post are current deputy general manager Jean
Balazuc, as well as director of the industry ministry's energy
department Claude Mandil, and Michel Francony, director of EdF-GdF
Services (which manages both utilities' distribution systems).

It remains to be seen to what extent Gadonneix will pursue the
internationalist and market oriented policies of his predecessor. He
must renegotiate the company's charter, which defines its activities.
At home GdF faces challenges from both electricity and fuel oil and
could face challenges to its monopoly of gas distribution from such
established service companies as Generale des Eaux or Lyonnaise des
Eaux. Internationally, Gadonneix will have to manage assets already
acquired in Canada, Uruguay and US. Eventually, he will also have to
face pressure from Brussels to deregulate, even if the European
Commission has decided to focus its attention on deregulating the
electricity market in the first instance, and is taking its time.

In his time at the industry ministry, Gadonneix worked with liberally
inclined ministers such as Michel d'Ornano, Rene Monory and Alain
Madelin. But he will face fierce opposition from the trade unions to
any proposals along the lines of le Floch-Prigent's plans to exchange
shareholdings with Russian gas company Gazprom, even if current
industry minister Franck Borotra favours selling minority stakes to an
Elf or a Statoil, or to individuals.

* GdF is to pay the state a dividend of FFr970m ($198.34m) for 1995,
while Electricite de France is to pay FFr1.5bn, according to figures
published in the official journal.

Forecasts of an accord by EU energy ministers on electricity market

HYDRO SEEKS 2000 OSEBERG GAS

Norsk Hydro has now submitted a NKr3.6bn ($569.8m) plan to Norway's
industry and energy ministry for development and operation of gas
reserves at its North Sea Oseberg field, with start of gas exports
targeted at 2000. Development would be via a new steel gas process and
export platform linked to the Oseberg field centre with gas exports
tied into the existing pipeline system in the Heimdal area. Recoverable
Oseberg gas reserves are put at 115 Bcm and average gas export at 4
Bcm/yr during 2000-2010, rising to 10 Bcm/yr thereafter.

Investment costs are estimated at NKr2.5bn for the field installations
and NKrl.lbn for the pipeline. Oseberg started oil production in 1988,
now running at some 0.5m b/d. Meanwhile, Norwegian state oil and gas
firm Statoil has now submitted a development and operation plan to the
ministry for the mid-Norwegian Aasgard field. A verdict on whether gas
from the project will be processed at Kaarstoe or Kollsnes remains
outstanding.

GAS DELIVERIES HIT NEW PEAK

Norwegian gas deliveries to continental Europe hit a new peak in early
December because of cold weather, according to state oil and gas firm
Statoil. Daily gas delivery orders received by the gas sales centre at
Stavanger and the Bygnes operations centre set the record during
December 5-8. Almost 55 MMcmd was piped through the Europipe and
Statpipe/Norpipe systems to Emden, Germany and the Zeepipe trunkline to
Zeebrugge, Belgium. With deliveries from Ekofisk on top, these sales
ensured maximum Norwegian deliveries in response to Europe's cold
weather, said Statoil.

NORFRA GROUP URGES SHORT LOOP

A 15-20 km by-pass loop linking Norway's Statpipe and Norpipe gas
trunklines around the Ekofisk centre, should replace the existing
connection via the North Sea field, according to state oil and gas firm
Statoil. It has put the proposal forward as operator of the NorFra
partnership planning a gasline from Norway to Dunkirk, France. A
government decision is expected by 1 March.

Costed at NKr500m ($79.14m), the short loop is preferred by NorFra
partners to a longer 150 km alternative, said Statoil. Due ready by
summer 1998, it will feed gas from fields including Statfjord and
Gullfaks into the Norpipe line to Emden. Completion will coincide with
completion of new facilities at Ekofisk which will in future handle gas
from Ekofisk alone.

Russia cut off Turkmen pipe access to Europe. Production in 1994
slumped to 35.6 Bcm and was planned at 34.6 Bcm last year. An increase

COLD SPELLS GOOD/BAD BG NEWS

Record low temperatures brought good news and bad news for beleaguered
British Gas over the Christmas/New Year period. Gas demand hit new
highs with the previous peak in England and Wales exceeded by 2% while
in Scotland, where temperatures fell as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius
in Glasgow, demand was 10% up on the previous high. BG said it was
managing to meet demand in England from storage and higher North Sea
production. In Scotland it was interrupting supply to businesses with
interruptible contracts. Bottled gas supplier Calor said it was selling
50% more gas than a year earlier.

Coming during a time of low industrial activity because of the holiday
period, the demand rise was attributable virtually entirely to higher
heating use. Spot natural gas prices firmed on the cold but the rise
was modest, about 0.25p/therm to around 10.5p, as only the
industrial/commercial market is deregulated as yet. With the current UK
gas glut posing major problems for BG, the higher cold weather demand
was welcome as one way of helping reduce the surplus.

But this good news came hand in hand with bad as BG faced making
compensation payments to thousands of customers for failure to respond
swiftly when central heating systems broke down. The problem focussed
on 3-star service contracts, for which customers pay over #100
($152.3m) a year with an expectation of attention within 24 hours of
notifying a breakdown. BG denied staff cuts were to blame for delays
and said weather conditions were exceptional. But the Gas Consumers
Council said it had tracked an increase in 3-star contract complaints
before Christmas and the cold snap.

BG APPOINTS CONTRACTS GURU

British Gas has now appointed a special negotiator to handle the take-
or-pay gas contracts problem that has faced it with costly write-downs.
At the same time it has indicated first producers to agree to
renegotiate contracts with BG will get best terms. So far North Sea
producers have shown no inclination to revamp long term take-or-pay
contracts to supply BG at prices well above current competitive market
levels. Job of BG's new chief negotiator Kenneth Gardener, a director
of Charterhouse Bank, is to persuade producers to come to the table.

Gardener, who took on his new post on 1 January, has given up executive
duties at Charterhouse but remains a director. On his appointment last
month he acknowledged producers would be reluctant to re-open legally
binding contracts but said he believed a "win win" position could
emerge from negotiations. He has agreed to give at least two years to
the problem. Meanwhile, BG has also indicated it will increase pressure
on producers after 1 February when the supply contracts will be
transferred to a new trading subsidiary.

News of the troubleshooter appointment was one factor in a sharp pre-
Christmas rally in BG shares which added some 9% in just a couple of
days, the price rising to 250p ($3.88); other factors were record cold
weather and renewed market speculation, so far unfounded, that a bid
may emerge for BG from the likes of Shell or BP. BG also underlined the
increased significance of legal issues in its affairs with appointment
of William Friedrich, formerly with international law firm Shearman &
Sterling, as its general counsel. Other recent senior appointments
include promotion of Harry Moulson, head of BG pipe unit TransCo, to
executive director and of Dr Pierre Jungels, formerly with Belgium's
Petrofina, as managing director, exploration and production.

HOMES COMPETITION 'ON COURSE'

The UK government is pressing ahead with a pilot trial of domestic gas
market competition this spring despite claims that necessary systems
are not ready. Some 0.5m household customers in southwest England are
due to be offered a choice of supplier, breaking the current British
Gas monopoly, from 1 April. BG pipeline unit TransCo sought delay of
the trial, expressing concern over lack of time for computer testing.
But in the run-up to Christmas industry and energy minister Tim Eggar
rejected the move.

Instead, it was agreed gas regulator Ofgas should appoint a
'troubleshooter' or 'controller' to ensure problems are sorted out and
the timetable is maintained. Following the offer from Amerada Hess of
savings of some 15% on current levels for households switching from BG,
Total has waded in with announced savings of up to 16%, with Swebgas,
regional electricity company in the southwest area, offering savings of
at least 17%. Texaco has also joined forces with LPG market leader
Calor to chase the domestic and small commercial natural gas markets.
BG has yet to reveal its hand on how it will respond to the household
market challenge.

MINISTER RESIGNATION HITS GAS TAX

Resignation and replacement of Austrian finance minister Andreas
Staribacher last week [2 January] will likely cause a further delay in
introduction of a tax on gas (IGR 287/12), variously labelled as an
energy, CO2 or environmental levy. Petroleum products came under the
tax last May, with gas, electricity and coal to follow. Originally the
extended tax was expected at the start of this year but parties to the
discussion, ranging from government to electricity and industrial
interests, have been unable to agree a formula which would be fair to
all consumers. Staribacher had argued in favour of the tax on gas on
grounds that the tax should be part of a general energy levy to
encourage reduced consumption, not to promote a shift from one energy
source to another.

As finance minister, he had been under considerable pressure to impose
the broadened tax as part of a programme to ease an unbearably large
budget deficit projected for this year. Staribacher's replacement as
finance minister is Viktor Klima, who leaves his previous post as
minister for state industry, transportation and communications. Before
joining the government, Klima was finance chief at OMV and will likely
be sympathetic to demands of the energy industry in view of OMV's
monopoly over gas imports.

The cabinet reshuffle as well as expected complications in forming a
new government following an indecisive election last month will now
probably postpone any possible introduction of the levy on gas and the
remaining energy resources until after mid-year at earliest. Once a
government is established, the issue of the amount of the tax and the
exceptions (such as gas used for electricity generation) will still
have to be resolved.

EVN/BAYERNWERKE LAND KOGAZ

Success of a joint $87m bid by Germany's Bayernwerke and Austria's
Energieversorgung Niederosterreich (EVN) in the second tender for
Hungary's Kogaz regional gas utility (IGR 289/4) has cemented a
partnership which could have further consequences. The two concerns
increased their offer for Kogaz by some $20m to win in their bid for a
50% plus one share holding in the utility which serves three provinces
in the southwestern part of the country bordering on Slovenia and
Croatia. EVN had hoped rather to gain a shareholding in a gas utility
bordering on Austria, making supply synergies possible, but had to be
content with the Kogaz award.

The Austrian concern has had a co-operation agreement with Kogaz for
some time. Kogaz  supplies about 190,000 customers in a service area
with a population of over 1m. Annual sales of about 700 Bcm are worth
about $6.2m. While EVN was the only Austrian utility to share in
Hungary's gas privatisation, the deal will not bring pleasure to OMV,
which holds a virtual monopoly over gas imports to Austria.

The reason is the stronger relationship which EVN will achieve with
Bayernwerke, seen by OMV and federal electricity authority Verbund as
an unwelcome intruder on the Austrian energy scene. Bayernwerke already
shares with EVN  a holding in Austria's one private gas and oil
producer, Rohol Aufsuchungs AG (RAG). The German concern has made
offers on several Austrian privatisations but has been rebuffed by OMV
and the Verbund with support from the government, which prefers to see
control of the energy sector remain in Austrian hands.

INDUSTRY CALLS FOR LPG TANK LAW

Although Austria's proposed new law governing fixed-location LPG tanks
was published last August, the legislation has not yet been passed.
Industry has urged that the oNORM M 7323 technical standard, virtually
identical to the German TRB 610 standard which took effect as of 1
January 1996, be enacted immediately in Austria. Industry points out
that the German standard was developed at some expense due to extensive
research and testing and that there is no reason the law not be adopted
at once. The regulation would apply to tanks used by private as well as
industry gas consumers.

GAS TRADER REPORTS SUCCESS

GWH Gas- u. Warenhandelsgesmbh, a joint venture trading house owned by
Austria's gas import monopoly OMV and Russia's Gazexport, has reported
a successful 1995 with a trading volume of Sch1.9bn ($190m). The firm
was set up in 1994 to expedite dealings between the two concerns and to
overcome Russian currency problems. Under agreements which run until
2012, Gazexport last year supplied about 1.7 Bcm of gas in exchange for
4,000 tonnes (t) of lubricants, 2,000t of polyethylene and about 1.2m
sq metres of geotextiles, with the latter products supplied by OMV's
plastics subsidiaries for use in the Russian gas industry. GWH was also
instrumental in expediting a long-term contract for transport of an
additional 500 MMcm of Russian gas through Austria to Bavaria via OMV
pipelines.

TIGAZ BOARD BACKS $280M PLAN

A board meeting of Hungarian utility Tigaz, whose control was recently
acquired by Italy's Italgas and Snam (IGR 289/4 and see separate
story), has named Eugenio Lancellotta as chairman and approved a five
year, $280m business plan. Lancellotta is already deputy chairman and
managing director of Turin-based Italgas. Among other appointments,
Biagio Marino is Tigaz managing director and Enrico Monti finance
director, while Janos Szalai is operations manager. At the time of
purchase of control last month, the Italgas-Snam consortium said it
planned to increase annual sales from 2.3 Bcm to 3 Bcm and the number
of customers from 800,000 to 1m.

THREE PIPE PRODUCERS FINED

Three leading producers of steel pipe for pipelines have been ordered
by Italy's Antitrust Authority to pay fines equivalent to 1% of their
1994 sales because of price fixing. Tubi Dalmine Ilva will have to pay
about L262m ($163,000); Arvedi Tubi Acciao, about L135m; and General
Sider Italiana, about L124m. A statement said the three, which have
over 70% of the domestic market, "have falsified the play of
competition in a consistent manner". A fourth firm, Ilva Lamiere e
Tubi, had also been investigated but the authority found insufficient
evidence of its involvement over any length of time.

GERMAN NORTH SEA GAS EYED AGAIN

BEB and its partners in the German North Sea Group are taking another
look at development of gas reserves in the German North Sea. All
options are being looked at and results of a Norwegian Aker study are
expected "at the beginning of 1996". Early in 1995 BEB said it had
taken a look at exploitation prospects for the gas and condensate in
1994 "but with the present state of the Deutschemark and an oil price
of, say, $15/bbl, it is not economic to produce now". That study was
based on a pipeline from the reserves, in blocks A/6-B/4, to Denmark,
and BEB then reckoned "that we need $20/bbl to make the scheme viable".

An offshore power station and a spur line to the Ekofisk-Emden Norpipe
trunkline have been other options considered. Front-running scheme now
is a tie-back to Amoco's Valhall platform in the Norwegian sector. Aker
Engineering is looking at a pipeline from A/6-B/4 via Norwegian, German
and Danish territorial waters (see also separate story). At the fields
a small wellhead platform would be sited in about 50 metres of water.

BEB last drilled a well in the area, B/4-4, in 1992; B/4-3 in 1988 was
a suspended gas find and previous finds had been made in A/6. One
problem with the gas is high nitrogen content. Gas has also been found
in H/15-H/18. BEB tells IGR that a A/6-B/4 "development would require
the drilling of more wells". No drilling elsewhere off Germany is
envisaged by the company in 1996.

REPSOL CONFIRMS T&T DEAL

Spain's oil, gas and chemical conglomerate Repsol confirmed in mid-
December it has bought the 20% stake in Trinidad and Tobago's Atlantic
LNG Co that was offered to Spain's industrial gas distributor Enagas.
Enagas will still buy 40% of the LNG produced at the Trinidad plant to
be built at a cost of $1bn and scheduled onstream in early 1999 (see
separate story). Repsol, whose gas operations now account for 25% of
its profits - Pta42.2bn ($349m) in the first nine months of 1995, up
26.6% - spent $200m on its share, which makes it the third biggest
partner in the 400 MMcfd LNG plant, after Amoco Trinidad LNG Co, an
affiliate of US Amoco Corp with 34%, and British Gas Trinidad LNG with
26%.

The other partners are Cabot Trinidad LNG, an affiliate of Cabot Corp
of the US, and Trinidad's public National Gas Co, with 10% each. The
remaining 60% of the 3m tonnes (t)/yr of LNG that the plant will
produce will be bought by Boston-based Cabot. Enagas and Cabot signed
an initial deal with Atlantic LNG in July and Enagas was given the
option to acquire 20% of the equity.

Although insiders thought Enagas would acquire the share, Repsol's move
is part of its own gas expansion programme. Repsol owns 45.3% of
Spain's domestic gas distributor Gas Natural, which in turn holds 91%
of Enagas. Repsol now has a foot firmly in Trinidad's important gas
market and Enagas will import a further 14.6bn thermies a year of LNG,
equivalent to 18% of Spain's current annual consumption, over a 20-year
period.

Enagas is holding talks with an unnamed shipping company to rent a
125,000t tanker to bring the LNG to Spain's regasification plants at
Huelva and Cartegena, with an option to buy the ship. Enagas has for
some years pursued a policy of expanding and diversifying its supply
sources, to give more flexibility and security to the Spanish gas
sector. A Repsol spokesman said its participation in the project
"strengthens the company's upstream integration and consolidates the
growing importance of natural gas in its activities". The investment
was made through Repsol affiliate Repsol International BV.

Meanwhile, the Spanish Treasury and state industrial holding company
SEPI are negotiating the 'destiny' of the approximate Pta80bn that will
be gained from the sale of 7% of Repsol shares in the New Year. The
state, through SEPI, owns 21% of Repsol and SEPI executives would like
the privatisation cash to help alleviate the Pta700bn debt it was left
with when defunct loss-making holding company INI was closed down last
year and partially replaced by SEPI. Treasury officials are said to
want to use the capital gain to help reduce the public deficit.

NEW SWITCH TO GAS FUEL

The Basque engineering unit of Babcock Wilcox has singed a Pta2bn
($16.5m) contract with southern Spanish utility Sevillana de
Electricidad to convert the fuel oil-fired Bahia de Algeciras power
station to gas use, only the second thermal plant to make the move so
far in Spain. After conversion, the station's boiler will be able to
use fuel oil or gas, or a mixture of both in any proportion. Gas de
Euskadi, owned by the Basque government's energy enterprise Ente Vasco
de la Energia (EVE) and national industrial gas distributor Enagas,
recorded nine-month 1995 gross profits of Pta917m, which compares with
gross profits of just Pta485m for the whole of 1994.

Gas de Euskadi in mid-December inaugurated a new distribution pipeline
in the Zalla district close to Bilbao. The consortium behind the future
Zabalgarbi gas-fired incinerator, the largest energy project under way
in the Basque country, has increased its capital from Pta400m to
Pta1.4bn. The consortium includes EVE and Babcock & Wilcox.

GN QUITS TELECOMS PLAY

Gas Natural has made a joint announcement with electricity utilities
Endesa and Sevillana de Electricidad that they are pulling out of
Spain's third main paging company, Compania Europea de Radiobusqueda
(Cersa), in which each holds a 9% stake. The three energy companies
have had this stake in telecommunications since 1992 through the
consortium Servicio de Radiotelefonia Movil (SRM), which holds 96% of
Cersa. There are two main reasons for the apparent reversal of Spanish
energy companies' diversification into telecommunications.

Late arrival of the paging service in Spain meant three large operators
with important investors emerged in the same year, just as the more
successful mobile telephone sector was taking off. This meant that
Cersa, with 25,000 clients, lost Pta420m ($3.5m) last year. One of
Spain's two leading paging companies is expected to buy the 27% of
shares to be put on offer - Mensatel, run by the semi-public
telecommunications giant Telefonia, or Sistelcom-Telemensaje, a
consortium which includes two utilities, Union Fenosa and Fecsa.

PGNIG IN FRESH NORWAY MOVE

Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo (PGNiG, Polish Oil and Gas) is
taking a fresh interest in Norwegian gas from the North Sea. The Polish
gas company sees construction of the 292 km, DM3bn ($2.20bn) Netra
pipeline as a fresh opportunity to achieve some of its long standing
ambition of diversifying gas imports away from Russia. The pipeline -
built by a consortium of BEB, Norsk Hydro, Ruhrgas and Statoil - links
the German North Sea terminal at Etzel with the gas distribution
network of the former German Democratic Republic at Salzwedel. This
brings Norwegian gas to within 70 km of the Polish border, so putting
in an additional link to Poland would be a relatively simple matter.

PGNiG hopes to start negotiations with owners of the Norwegian
gasfields in the next three to four months, aiming for deliveries to
start in two or three years. Whether these talks will succeed remains
to be seen. But PGNiG was confident the Norwegians could produce the
gas cheaply enough to deliver it at a price that would be attractive to
the Poles. That would be some $85-95/Mcm at the Polish border,
preferably either in the region of Szczecin or Gorzelec (Goerlitz).

Furthermore, Poland has made considerable economic progress in the last
few years and has made its peace with the London Club of private
creditor banks, thereby improving its credit rating. This should
forestall the kind of difficulties the Poles experienced when they
tried to buy gas from the British North Sea a couple of years ago.
Those talks failed when the owners required payment for three years
ahead, and guarantees of quantities to be bought further ahead than
that.

At the same time, the Norwegian energy minister Jens Stoltenberg has
noted Russian gas supplier Gazprom had grasped that its clients wanted
to diversify supplies and now saw this as a normal condition of doing
business in Europe. France takes no more than 30% of its gas from
Russia and Germany has adopted a similar target after its supplies were
disrupted by a dispute between Russia and the Ukraine, through whose
territory the pipeline feeding Germany runs.

The Poles get nearly 60% of their supplies from Russia, which provides
some 6 Bcm/yr out of a total Polish consumption of some 10.5 Bcm; the
remaining 4.5 Bcm is produced in Poland. It is unlikely any Norwegian
gas would get Poland's dependence on Russia quite as low as 30%. PGNiG
is looking to import perhaps 2 Bcm to 3 Bcm a year from the North Sea,
which would represent no more than 15-20% of demand by the time it
started landing since Poland's gas requirements are expected to rise
sharply - to perhaps 27 Bcm by 2010, depending on growth and fuel mix
assumptions made.

Investigaciones Petroliferas to carry out major work on Gulf of Cadiz
gasfields. Involved are the Poseidon North and Poseidon South fields
some 40 km offshore. Allseas will design, fabricate and install three
subsea manifolds together with 63 km of 10-inch pipeline, split into
three sections. Tie-in work is also involved, both at wellheads and
manifolds. Control umbilicals will also be laid. The work, in up to 132
metres of water, will be carried out early in 1997, using the Lorelay

INTERCONNECTOR TRANSIT INTEREST

Belgium's Distrigaz will shortly invite companies to indicate interest
in subscribing for transit pipeline capacity in Belgium linked to the
proposed UK-Zeebrugge Interconnector gas pipeline project. Responses
will be required by February next year at latest. Distrigaz gas supply
and sales director Jean Vermeire last month said he wanted to "remove
some uncertainties that may still exist with respect to our position
on, and the progress of, the planned enhancement of our transit
capacities". He told a Financial Times natural gas conference in London
work on Belgian grid reinforcements required for transit gas flows
associated with the Interconnector was on course.

"I can assure you that all studies and preparatory work are on schedule
to put the required transit capacity in place by October 1998, or such
later date as may be determined by the effective start-up of the
Interconnector or the readiness of new onward connections in transit
destination countries (referred to as the Commissioning Date)," he
said. "In order to determine which transit capacity the market may
require and hence to finalise design and size of new pipelines and grid
reinforcements, Distrigaz will very shortly solicit formal expressions
of interest in subscribing for transit capacity with a view to
concluding long-term transit contracts."

Vermeire said potential shippers willing to enter into such long-term
commitments by the end of second-quarter 1996 - the point at which pipe
and other equipment orders would have to be placed - would then be
assured of availability of the requested transit service from the
Commissioning Date. Subsequent shippers would get different terms. A
detailed information memorandum on transit services on offer was being
made available to potential shippers before end-1995. This would
provide relevant information for shippers to allow them to declare
their interest by February 1996 at the latest. Earlier, he said the go-
ahead decision for the Interconnector could double the gas transit flow
through Belgium - an estimated 15 Bcm this year - by around the turn of
the century.

Dr Burckhard Bergmann, board member of major German gas supplier
Ruhrgas, told the conference many issues still remained open on the
Interconnector (IGR 288/6). These included the destination of the
volumes and how they would be moved on from Zeebrugge. Outlets appeared
feasible which led to a higher netback than the current spot price at
the UK beach. But the question was to what extent it made sense for
producers to commit themselves to these prices on a long-term basis.
There was a wide spectrum of driving forces.

But what was unsatisfactory was that these forces were not geared
towards sustainable developments. Instead, they originated in a UK
disequilibrium which had not ensued from a misjudgement of supply and
demand "but from permanent regulatory intervention. It would be naive
to assume that the currently low spot prices in the UK are the outcome
of liberalisation and the result of high efficiency gains. They are
instead the consequence of a supply overhang resulting largely from the
permanent regulatory corrections made once the privatisation structure
of British Gas in 1986 was found to be unsatisfactory".

Bergmann continued: "What disturbs us, therefore, is not that a
balanced liberal gas market should have repercussions for the west
European Continent via the Interconnector but that there is exposure to
the disequilibrium of the current regulatory transformation and finally
also a growing marginal cost approach to the Interconnector itself."
One key issue, he said, would be whether producers who had participated
in the Interconnector increasingly viewed the investment as a sunk
cost.

Nevertheless, Ruhrgas expected the disequilibrium, and hence the
effects for the north-western part of Continental Europe, to be reduced
via the Interconnector. Although the spot market would not completely
disappear, it would most probably remain confined. The destination for
Interconnector gas on the Continent was still unclear. "Many look to
the German market, the largest but also well-supplied market. A great
deal will depend on whether a substantial quantity can be supplied to
Italy via France. It remains to be seen whether a separate transit
pipeline through Belgium to Germany also materialises.

"There are also other interesting transport opportunities for companies
wishing to obtain gas for Germany from the Interconnector. It must be
borne in mind when constructing a separate pipeline via Belgium - as
with the Interconnector - that the carrying capacity commitments will
cover a longer period than the prospective duration of deliveries."
Bergmann noted that Central European countries were also interested in
obtaining gas from the UK continental shelf. "We support their efforts
in this respect but the long distance makes it very hard to find an
economical solution."

STORAGE WINS GRONINGEN TIME

Development of DFL2.5bn ($1.59bn) worth of natural gas storage in the
Netherlands will meet short to medium term supply needs but extensive
compression, possibly costing DFL4bn, will be needed on the giant Dutch
Groningen field in about a decade to meet future requirements. That is
one of the conclusions of an assessment of Dutch gas storage needs by
consultant Wood Mackenzie*. Main driver is a decline in peak delivery
capacity of leading Dutch gas marketer Gasunie. Dutch oil and gas
company NAM and Amoco of the US are currently working to bring three
peak shaving storage facilities on stream in 1997 (IGR  288/14).
WoodMac notes that with the exception of the Maasvlakte LNG facility,
no dedicated peak shaving/gas storage facilities have been developed in
the Netherlands to date.

This has been avoided by availability of large local gas reserves
together with high production capacity, flexible supply contracts and a
comprehensive infrastructure. Seasonal and short term demand rises have
generally been met through higher output directly from producing
fields. With Dutch output dominated by Groningen, this field has been
conserved as a strategic reserve and swing producer. Last year 42% of
the total annual gas volume (82.1 Bcm) bought by Dutch gas marketer
Gasunie was produced from Groningen. The rest came from other onshore
fields (19%), offshore fields (35%) and imports from Norway (3.5%) and
the UK (0.5%). But during peak demand periods Groningen provides about
75% of deliveries.

As of 1 January 1995 some 2,070 Bcm of gas had been produced in the
Netherlands but Gronigen still holds estimated remaining recoverable
reserves of some 1,275 Bcm, says WoodMac. A further 700 Bcm is held
within other developed fields and future Dutch developments. At current
production rates, reserves are sufficient to supply domestic and export
markets for nearly a quarter of a century. Over the next five years the
analyst expects total gas sales in the Netherlands to rise 5-6% from 44
Bcm in 1995 to 46 Bcm in 2000. With the Netherlands established as a
major gas exporter, Gasunie in 1994 exported 38.3 Bcm, 47% of total
sales; of this 59% went to Germany, 14% to Belgium, 13% to France, 14%
to Italy and 1% to Switzerland. Overall exports are expected to stay
relatively flat in the medium term.

WoodMac reckons domestic Dutch production will rise about 7% from some
82 Bcm/yr currently to about 88 Bcm/yr in 2000. Current imports of
about 3 Bcm/yr from Norway and the UK are expected to rise notably in
the next five years, although not to much over 6 Bcm/yr or 7% of total
Dutch supply. However, these deliveries have relatively limited
flexibility in terms of swing to reflect demand variations. Import
capacity is also partly constrained by Gasunie's role as a transporter
of some 10 Bcm/yr of gas for third parties, including Norwegian
deliveries to France and Belgium.

Moreover, although Dutch output is expected to rise, output from
existing offshore fields and onshore fields other than Groningen is
expected to fall in the late 1990s and after 2000. Consequently,
greater demand will be placed on Groningen production. In the absence
of a major upturn in exploration/development activity, which the
analyst does not currently foresee, or substantially increased imports
(such as could potentially arise through the UK-Belgium
Interconnector), output from Groningen, while falling in the short
term, is expected to rise to about 40 Bcm/yr in 2000.

At the same time, however, the flexibility provided by Groningen is now
being limited by the fall in reservoir pressure in the field and this
problem will be compounded when the higher output levels are needed,
says the report. Therefore, despite its access to more than sufficient
gas volumes to meet projected overall demand for many years to come,
Gasunie has had to initiate projects to maintain its delivery capacity
in order to keep supply and demand in phase as the flexibility of older
fields, particularly Groningen, to provide necessary swing falters.
"This decline in delivery capacity could affect Gasunie's supply
commitments," says WoodMac; "indeed, without the provision of new peak
shaving facilities there is a real possibility that Gasunie would be
unable to supply sufficient gas during a severe winter from 1996."

Of the three new gas storage facilities now planned (see table), two
will be operated by Shell/Esso joint venture NAM (50% holder of
Gasunie) - one at the partly depleted Langelo/Norg gasfield in the
Drenthe concession in the north of the country, the other at the
Grijpskerk gasfield. Amoco will develop the third project at the
Alkmaar field in the Bergen concession, strategically located close to
the large industrial market in the west of the country, notes WoodMac.
The three are due to be phased in from 1997, becoming fully operational
by winter 2000/01, at which stage they should hold some 7 Bcm of gas
and provide peak delivery capacity of 184 MMcmd, the additional
capacity representing about 30% of expected peak demand for Dutch gas
in 2000. In the longer term, Alkmaar could be extended to provide 500
MMcm of storage and a maximum delivery rate of 36 MMcmd, says the
report.

In overall terms, these developments will not boost total delivery
capacity substantially over recent levels, it says. But they will in
general compensate for the declining flexibility of producing fields.
In addition, Gasunie's new export contracts incorporate a lower level
of swing than older contracts, helping relieve pressure on delivery
capacity. However, as gas to gas competition increases in Europe, a
decline in delivery flexibility could cut the competitive advantage
held by Gasunie, warns WoodMac.

The new facilities will provide a solution for the company's gas
delivery capacity problems in the short to medium term and provide
extra flexibility in the longer term at a cost of about DFL2.5bn in
money of the day (mod). Their development has allowed a delay in
installation of extensive compression facilities at Groningen.
"However, this compression, which could cost around DFL4bn (mod), is
expected to be needed around the middle of the next decade in order to
meet future supply requirements and ultimately improve the recovery
factor of the field." WoodMac also notes provision of gas storage in
the Netherlands is a new area of opportunity for upstream companies to
expand their role downstream and add value to the gas they supply.

NOW TOTAL GAS DEAL CLOSE?

Total is reported to be close to signing a deal (possibly in
partnership with Spain's Repsol) to exploit the Tin Fouye Tabankort
(TFT) field in the Algerian Sahara, southeast of Hassi R'Mel, near the
border with Libya. The field is estimated to contain 144.6 Bcm of
natural gas, 15.6m tonnes (t) of gas which can be turned into LPG, and
16.6mt of condensates. This deal would be based on the same legislation
that made BP's contract at In Salah possible (see separate story).
Since gas is considered a national asset in Algeria, it took a special
law to allow Sonatrach to go into partnership with a foreign oil
company. As soon as the BP deal was signed, Algeria's oil minister
Ammar Makhloufi said it should serve as a model for other deals.

Algeria is keen to exploit its gas, which accounts for some 95% of its
export revenues. Indeed, the country plans to increase liftings from
some 30 Bcm in 1995 to 60 Bcm by 2000. That is why contracts are being
signed. At the same time, signings are proof the recent election
victory of President Liamine Zeroual has reassured western oil
companies Algeria will enjoy a sufficient measure of political
stability.

Elsewhere, Total has announced it plans to invest some 15% of new funds
in Asia, with a view to making 20% of its operating profits in the
area. Gas will figure prominently. In particular, the natural gas
liquefaction plant at Bontang in Borneo is to be extended with a
seventh and eighth liquefaction line. The oil company also plans to get
involved in building gas-fired electricity generating stations in the
region.

QATAR IN PHILIPPINES TALKS

Qatar is considering supplying LNG to First Gas Holdings Corp (FGHC) of
the Philippines, according to FGHC officials cited by Reuters. Qatar
energy and industry minister Abdullah Bin Hamad Al Attiyah met with
corporation officials on a visit to the Philippines, it said. First Gas
is a joint venture of First Philippine Holdings and British Gas and has
been planning gas fired power generation in the Philippines.

Meanwhile, Qatar hopes to sign a $680m loan with international banks in
March for offshore facilities for the Qatar Liquefied Gas Company
(Qatargas) LNG project, the country's first, according to an energy and
industry ministry official. The loan would be a mix of buyers credit
and commercial debt, covering 70% of the offshore portion of the
project, he told Reuters. Qatargas is to sell 4m tonnes (t)/yr of LNG
to Japan's Chubu Electric over 25 years from January 1997 and another
2mt/yr to seven other Japanese power and gas utilities for 25 years
from mid-1998.

A consortium of Japan's five major shipping firms is to invest Y250bn
($2.42bn) to build 10 tankers to ship Qatari LNG to Japan, economic
daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. The five are Nippon Yusen KK,
Mitsui OSK Lines, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, lino Kaiun Kaisha and Showa
Line. The tankers will ship 6mt/yr starting in 1997.

FIRMS PLAN AMMONIA PRODUCTION

Mozambique's state owned National Hydrocarbons Company has signed an
agreement with Canada's Scimitar Production and Zarara Petroleum
Resources of the United Arab Emirates to build an ammonia production
plant targeted at exports to Zimbabwe by end-1997, according to Maputo
daily Noticias. It quoted Mozambique deputy energy and mineral
resources minister Castigo Langa as saying the Zimbabwean market was
guaranteed and work would start "very soon".

The plant, expected to produce 100 tonnes/day of ammonia for export to
Zimbabwe, will use natural gas reserves in Buzi district southwest of
port city Beira. A pipeline will also be built from Buzi to Beira where
gas will generate electricity for the city. Zarara's Shukri Saleh
cautioned, however, that known Buzi gas reserves would support ammonia
production for only eight years. He urged Mozambique to start searching
for other gas reserves believed to exist in the area.

Mozambique towards end-1995 separately signed an agreement with Enron
Corp of the US for development of its Pande gasfield, targeted at
feeding markets in South Africa via a 1,300 km pipeline. Customers have
yet to be lined up.

SOUTH AFRICA GROUP EYES MOSSGAS

South African chemical and synthetic fuel firms Sasol Ltd, AECI Ltd and
Sentrachem Ltd have set up a group to talk with the South African
government about buying the financially troubled Mossgas oil-from-
natural gas plant. The Department of Mineral and Energy Affairs lately
decided to seek a buyer (IGR 289/20). Mossgas has said that unless the
complex is sold it will have to be mothballed when current gas supplies
are finished in 1997 or new offshore fields must be exploited.

The government believes the $3bn plant could be sold for about $675m,
then turned into an oil refinery or a methanol producer. A recently
finished study found methanol production from it was feasible at
internationally competitive prices. The bidding group reckons its
methanol route would require only 25% of the gas needed to make
synthetic fuels.

MORE GAS SET FOR PETCHEMS

Egypt is prepared to supply more gas to Israel for use as a
petrochemical feedstock but the exact amount will depend on needs.
Potential customers had until end-December to provide the Israeli
energy ministry with estimates of their demand, following meetings
between Israeli and Egyptian officials. Earlier last year Israeli
energy minister Gonen Segev said he had received official confirmation
from Egyptian General Petroleum Corp, Agip and Amoco on supply of 2.5
Bcm/yr of Egyptian gas for 20 years (see also separate story). At that
time he said up to a fifth of the gas would be used for petrochemicals,
mainly ammonia. Israel has long been pressing for a supply of natural
gas from Egypt, notably for production of electricity. For some years
it has received a modest regular supply of Egyptian oil.

UMC WELL COMES GOOD

United Meridian Corp (UMC) has sunk an eighth consecutive successful
well in block CI-11 off the Ivory Coast. With six Lion field oil wells
and two Pathere field gas wells on stream, the company anticipates
production of 20,000 b/d of oil and 24 MMcfd of gas at start-1996. The
B-3 well followed recently successful sixth and seventh holes (IGR
283/12).  The new wildcat flowed 5,970 b/d of oil and 4.6 MMcfd of gas
through a 56/64-inch choke from 63 net ft of gas pay and 169 ft of net
oil pay in a new fault block over a total depth of 10,419 ft. B-3 also
confirmed the presence of Senonian gas sands 4,000 ft southeast of the
B-1 Lion discovery well.

MAGHREB LINE WINS NEW CREDITS

The Maghreb-Europe natural gas pipeline from Algeria to Spain and
Portugal won two new credit lines before the New Year. First the
European Investment Bank conceded a Pta22.2bn ($187m) credit to Spain's
industrial gas operator Enagas to help finance the section that will
run from Tarifa on the southern coast into Portugal. Then Spain's
Instituto de Credito Offical (ICO) agreed a $200m credit to help
finance the section of the pipeline being built in Morocco. Enagas, 91%
owned by Gas Natural, is financing the Spanish section which will run
from Tarifa via Cordoba to Portugal through the Spanish regions of
Andalucia and Extremadura.

The guarantors of the loan are the Grupo Gas Natural, the European
Investment Fund and a banking syndicate. The Spanish stretch of the
pipeline will cost $400m of the total amount of $2.6bn The ICO credit
for Europe Maghreb Pipeline Ltd, jointly owned by Portugal's public
company Transgas and Spain's Sagane, will help finance the 540 km
section that runs from the Algeria-Morocco border to Moroccan
international water limits in the Strait of Gibraltar.

Meanwhile, oil, gas and chemical conglomerate Repsol - which owns 45.3%
of Gas Natural - has agreed to change the route of a local pipeline
which is to link two gasfields in the southwest province of Huelva to
the national network. The line would have passed through the Donana
national park, one of Europe's most important wetlands for migratory
birds. Repsol's announcement, which will mean extending the line by
nearly 30 km, followed protests from the park authorities and
ecologists.

PRICE HITCH FOR PIPELINE PLANS

Much trumpeted plans to pipe Qatar and Iran gas to Pakistan have run
into further trouble with the two countries demanding a higher price
for gas they plan to supply to Pakistan. This obstacle has been created
in the early stages of the project, sources close to the Pakistani
government said. An official of the petroleum and natural resources
ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity, said both Iran and Qatar
had come up with new demands for the gas price and expressed their
inability to sell at the previously agreed tariff. He said negotiations
between the three countries were, however, continuing.

Chaudrhy Nisar Ali Khan, former minister of petroleum and natural
resources in the government of Nawaz Sharif, said the Bhutto
administration had signed agreements for supply of gas from Iran, Qatar
and Turkmenistan which provided for completion of feasibility studies
in 12 months. But three months had elapsed and they were still not
complete. The question of gas tariff had also been sorted out at that
time but the government had allowed it to become an issue, he claimed.
Sources close to the government said that besides the question of gas
tariff, there were other issues hampering implementation of memoranda
of understanding Pakistan signed with Iran and Qatar. However, they
declined to discuss them.

TWO BIDS FOR PAK-IRAN LINE

The Pakistani government has so far received two bids from
multinational oil companies for construction of the planned 1,700 km
Pak-Iran gas pipeline project for import of 1.6 Bcfd of gas from Iran.
The companies bidding include a consortium of four firms comprising
British Gas, Gaz de France, Shell International and Calgery of
Malaysia. The other bidder is Australia's BHP. Industry sources said
last date for submission of bids with proposals for import of gas from
Iran to Pakistan was 30 November, but on the request of bidders the
date was extended to 12 December, as they were busy finalising issues
among themselves.

Sources in the petroleum and natural resources ministry said BHP
submitted its bid on schedule - 30 November. Initially, the government
had issued letters of intent to six companies including Canada's Nova
Gas in September but that company pulled out of the project, while most
of the rest of the firms decided to establish a consortium. The
proposed Pak-Iran gas pipeline project would import 1.6 Bcfd of natural
gas at an estimated cost of $3.5bn. The 1,700 km pipeline is expected
to be completed by 2002.

Industry sources said bids would be opened in mid-January. The
successful company would be asked to start construction of the pipeline
by June 1996. The firm would also be responsible for operation and
maintenance and the project would be based on a build-own-operate
basis. The agreement package would include purchase of gas from Iran
and its delivery to Pakistan at an agreed point at a price consistent
with the price offered by other gas exporters such as Qatar and
Turkmenistan.

The Bhutto government is negotiating with Turkmenistan and Qatar for
import of a similar quantity of gas to meet growing demand in the
country. Discussion with the Turkmenistan government is in early
stages, industry sources said. But negotiations with Qatar authorities
have been delayed for more than a year due reportedly to a dispute
between the Qatari government and sponsor of the gas pipeline project,
Crescent Petroleum Co, which would be responsible for importing gas to
Pakistan, over the price for gas it will pay Qatar.

QATAR/TURKEY LNG DEAL 'CLOSE'

Qatar and Turkey will shortly sign a deal for a sales and purchase
agreement (SPA) on supply of 2m tonnes (t)/yr of Qatari LNG to Ankara,
according to a Qatari official. "We believe we can come to an
understanding shortly on 2m tonnes later," Jaber Al Marri, vice
chairman of state-owned Qatar General Petroleum Corp (QGPC) said. QGPC
and its joint venture partner Mobil Corp signed a preliminary
memorandum of understanding with Turkish pipeline company Botas in
January under which Turkey would buy an initial 2mt of Qatari LNG for
25 years.

EGYPT-ISRAEL ACCORD FLAGGED

A letter of intent vis a vis planned supplies of Egyptian gas to Israel
is likely to be signed this coming week, according to Israeli sources.
The document will define "late 1996 or early 1997" as deadline for
negotiations but will not refer to prices or quantities. Sources also
say Israel has virtually completed assessments of its gas needs, having
completed a survey of major potential consumers. Meanwhile, there has
been growing activity in Israel by groups interested in the project. On
18 December Israel's largest private fuel company Paz, announced a
cooperation agreement with Amoco, one of the companies with gasfields
in Egypt slated for the Israeli market. Paz is two-thirds owned by the
Liberman-Bino group and one third by Renaissance-Claridge and others.

Apart from being the largest gasoline retailer, it holds 35% of the
country's total LPG market and 40% of the residential LPG market
(600,00 households). Amoco's Cairo-based vice president (Mideast
natural gas) Tony Barrett said Paz and Amoco had "been exploring
opportunities in various segments of the natural gas industry -
including transmission, storage and distribution to the end markets".
Energy minister Gonen Segev has ruled out the possibility of any group
controlling both transmission and distribution of the gas, so the new
consortium will have to choose in which area it wishes to compete.

Paz board chairman Mordechai Ben Shach described Amoco's approach to
the gas project as "vertical" but added "we are waiting for a decision
by the state. Whatever tender we decide to bid for, the partnership
will be on a basis of equality, both regarding ownership and
investment". The Paz-Amoco deal caught most energy observers by
surprise as Amoco was expected to team up with a big company consortium
comprising the Mashav, Delek and Dankner groups with whom it had been
negotiating for more than a year.

However, leading Israeli business daily Globes reported subsequently
that - despite the Amoco-Paz deal-the consortium was still negotiating
with Amoco about involvement in setting up gas-fired power stations in
the region. And two days after the Paz-Amoco announcement, Enron's
executive in charge of negotiating an LNG deal with Israel, Rebecca
Mark, said the Mashav-Delek-Dankner group and Enron had a cooperation
agreement regarding import of LNG from Qatar. Together with Enron, the
consortium would invest in a $300m plant in Israel to gasify LNG.

Marks said that - for economic reasons-Enron would prefer the facility
to be located at Eilat or Aqaba rather than Ashkelon, the site
preferred by Israel's energy ministry. This would enable Jordan to
participate in the project and lower the gas price. Mark reportedly
said that "in principle" Enron preferred Eilat to Aqaba. If Aqaba was
chosen, an 8 km pipeline connection to Israel would be needed and Enron
would seek Jordanian partners for the gasification project. (Press
reports said negotiations with Enron were deadlocked because Israel
considered the price being asked for the LNG - more than $4/MMBtu - as
excessive).

Meanwhile, on 2 January Globes reported Gaz de France (GdF) was on the
verge of signing an agreement with the Mashav-Delek-Dankner group for
joint activity in the tenders relating to import of Egyptian gas. The
paper quoted unidentified energy sources as saying GdF's involvement
could be problematic because in 1994 a GdF-affiliated company,
Sofregaz, had carried out the feasibility study for the Egyptian gas
project on behalf of the Israeli energy ministry. The sources said the
issue would probably have to be decided by the government's legal
adviser. However, energy minister Segev "does not believe GdF's
participation in tenders will represent a problem", according to
Globes.

COST CUTS MAY FORCE MERGERS

Uncertainty over MTBE prices and the need to keep methanol production
costs in check (IGR 270/14) is forcing Sabic to take another look at
the structure of its industry. Now, in an attempt to cut administration
costs, the company is mulling the merger of two subsidiaries based in
al-Jubayl. If the plan goes ahead, methanol producers Ar-Razi and Ibn
Sina will merge, as will MTBE producers Ibn Zahr and Ibn Sina.

Unclear is whether Sabic intends to split Ibn Sina's methanol and MTBE
sides so as to form a single methanol producer and a single MTBE
manufacturer. Even larger cost savings should be possible if all three
firms come together. One problem facing Sabic, however, is the
ownership structure of the companies. Ar-Razi is 50% owned by a
Japanese consortium led by Mitsubishi Gas Chemical. Ibn Sina is 25%
owned by Hoechst Celanese with another 25% in the hands of Panhandle
Eastern.

Ibn Zahr is 10% owned by Neste, 10% by Ecofuel and 10% by Apicorp.
Sabic reckons it might be necessary to cut back on the foreign
shareholdings in order to effect mergers. That assumes a willingness to
co-operate on the part of the foreign partners. It also assumes Sabic
could do without the marketing expertise (and in some cases markets)
provided by those partners. Unitisation might provide the answer but
the mood in Saudi Arabia at present is not in favour of foreign
ownership in general.

SHIP CHARTER SLASHES COST

Oman LNG has scrapped plans to build dedicated LNG tankers for its
planned LNG-export scheme. That, says general manager Tony Hanna, will
cut overall costs from $6bn to $5bn. To handle the 3m tonnes/yr
intended for Korea Gas, chartered ships will be used instead. Detailed
terms for the 25-year contract are currently being negotiated, says
Hanna, but it is already decided that outside finance will be sought
for 70% of the cost. Oman LNG shareholders will put up 30% - $1.5bn -
in proportion to their holdings. That pans out at $765m from the Omani
government (51%); $510m from Shell (34%); $90m from Total (6%); $45m
each from Mitsui and Mitsubishi (3% each); $30m from Partex (2%); and
$15m from Itochu (1%).

PETRONAS DETAILS NEW LNG PLANT

Malaysia's third LNG plant, for which a deal was signed last month (IGR
289/33), will have two liquefaction trains of 3.4m tonnes (t)/yr
capacity each, boosting Malaysian LNG output to 22mt/yr. Mohamed Hassan
Marican, president and chief executive of Malaysian state oil and gas
firm Petronas, said gas from the new project was expected to be taken
up by traditional buyers Japan, South Korea and Taiwan and also new
markets like India, China and Thailand. Asia Pacific area LNG demand,
currently 56mt/yr, was forecast to rise to about 80mt/yr by 2005, he
said.

The new LNG plant at Bintulu, Sarawak will be owned 60% by Petronas and
10% each by US parented Occidental LNG (M), Japan's Nippon Oil Co,
Shell Gas BV and Sarawak state. Hassan gave no project cost but said a
guide was the 17bn ringgit ($6.7bn) investment in Malaysia's second LNG
plant. An initial deal between Petronas, Nippon and Oxy was reached in
1993 with Shell, already a major LNG player in Malaysia, invited in
later with Sarawak. The new plant will process gas from fields found by
Oxy, Petronas, Nippon and Shell offshore Sarawak.

At the same time as the LNG signing, Petronas (60%) signed a deal with
local firm Land & General Bhd and Japan's Mitsui and Co (20% each) for
a $300m, 0.4mt/yr capacity vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) plant targeted
at commercial production start by late 1998. Officials said Mitsui and
Land & General would spend another $100m to set up a separate polyvinyl
chloride (PVC) plant for which VCM is a feedstock. The two plants will
be at Kertih in Trengganu state which, Hassan said, Petronas aims to
turn into SE Asia's largest petrochemicals centre. He said a
"worldscale" 0.6mt/yr ethylene plant would be built at Kertih, while an
existing ethylene facility in the area would be expanded from 0.32mt/yr
capacity to 0.4mt/yr.

TENNECO WINS GASLINE LICENCE

Australia's Queensland state said it had granted a pipeline licence to
Tenneco Energy Australia Pty Ltd, part of US Tenneco Inc, to build a
750 km, 90 petajoules/yr capacity gasline between Ballera in southwest
Queensland and Wallumbilla, near Roma. Tenneco had indicated
construction work would start immediately targeted at operation of the
line by end-September 1996, state minerals and energy minister Tony
McGrady said. Tenneco was chosen as preferred developer in late 1994.
Construction of the line would mean gas markets in southeast and
central Queensland were assured of future access to plentiful gas
supplies as existing reserves around Roma were depleted, said McGrady.
The line's capacity was over double current east coast market demand,
he added.

YACHENG GAS FEEDS HONG KONG

China on 1 January started piping natural gas from the South China Sea
Yacheng 13-1 field offshore Hainan Island to Hong Kong under a 20 year
contract to feed power generation, according to officials of state
owned China National Offshore Oil Co (CNOOC). Owned 51% by CNOOC, 34.7%
by US parented Arco China and 14.3% by Kuwait Foreign Petroleum
Exploration Corp (Kufpec), the $1.2bn Yacheng 13-1 development has
annual production capacity of 3.4 Bcm and total reserves of about 82
Bcm, according to CNOOC.

Some 2.9 Bcm/yr shipped via a 790 km gasline will feed the Hong Kong
Black Point power plant of Castle Peak Power Corp, a 50/50 joint
venture of Hong Kong's China Light and Power and Exxon Corp of the US.
The remaining 0.5 Bcm/yr will feed power and chemicals plants on Hainan
Island via another 91 km gasline. According to Xinhua news agency,
Hainan plans to invest 10bn yuan ($1.2bn) to build three synthetic
ammonia and urea plants on the island in the next five years, fed by
natural gas.

Using some 2.2 Bcm/yr these plants would, on completion produce about
0.45m tonnes (t)/yr of synthetic ammonia and 0.78mt/yr of urea, said
Xinhua. Hainan also planned to build a methanol plant of 1mt/yr
capacity, a chemical works and acetylene salt chemical works. Annual
natural gas output in the area round Hainan was expected to reach some
10 Bcm by end-century and 21 Bcm by 2007, it said.

DABHOL D-DAY LOOMS - AGAIN

The fate of the Dabhol power generation project is likely to be decided
on 6 January. Maharashtra Chief Minister Manohar Joshi says a special
meeting of the state cabinet has been called that day to consider the
matter. Later, as IGR went to press, local reports quoted an unnamed
state minister as saying a revised deal had been approved by the state
and announcement was a formality. The state government has been pushed
into a decision before 15 January when arbitration proceedings at the
behest of the US project promoters Enron, Bechtel and GE are scheduled
to resume in London. The promoters had earlier agreed to postponement
of the proceedings until 10 December, the deadline set by Joshi for
decisive action (IGR 289/4).

But the opinion of senior state government officials to seek more
capital cost and tariff cuts than agreed with an experts committee
compelled him to pursue an apparently tough negotiating line. Extra
mileage gained in the negotiations can also yield electoral dividends
to the ruling Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party coalition which is keen
to rake up the corruption issue in coming elections against the main
rival Congress party whose government approved the Dabhol deal.

Sources say a compromise has been reached after Enron Development Corp
president Joseph Sutton conveyed to Joshi in late December that it
would not yield further on cost and tariff cuts. This provides for a
marginal reduction of tariff from the Rs1.89 ($0.054) levelised tariff
agreed earlier with the experts negotiating group. In return,
Maharashtra State Electricity Board will agree to lift power at more
than the 90% Plant Load Factor mentioned in the original Power Purchase
Agreement. This arrangement will keep intact the internal rate for
Dabhol Power Co.

MOBIL IN LPG JOINT VENTURE

About 0.5m tonnes (t)/yr of LPG is to be imported to India by Peevees
Petroleum Products Ltd (PPPL), a joint venture announced between Mobil
Asia Pacific Pte from Singapore and a Dubai-based Indian. Mobil has a
45% stake in PPPL which is to spend Rs830m ($23.71m) in the first phase
of the project to import, bottle and market 150,000t of LPG in southern
India. Two bottling plants of 50,000t capacity each are to be built at
Chaliyam in Kerala and Karur in Tamil Nadu in the first phase to be
completed by December 1996 when coverage will include 700,000 domestic
users and 50,000t of bulk supply to industries. A RCC jetty with 2,800t
tankage will go with it. Port dredging to 11 metres depth for 20,000t
tanker parcels and a further 20,000t cryogenic tankage is to be taken
up in the second phase to increase LPG volume handling capacity to
500,000 t/yr.

ESSAR/PREMIER LAND R FIELDS

India-UK consortium Essar Oil-Premier Oil has been picked by selection
panel authorities for development of the R-series of hydrocarbon fields
in the Bombay offshore. It has proposed peak output of 22,865 b/d of
oil based on an estimated 87.24m bbls of oil in a 22-year production
profile. R-series fields figure among the eight medium-sized and 33
small fields offered by the government in October 1993 for production
of oil and gas in joint ventures with national oil companies Oil &
Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd.

The Tenders Evaluation Committee (TEC) selected Essar-Premier in
preference to close rival Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL)-Santa Fe, an
Indo-US combine. The committee noted "the scheme proposed by Essar
consortium may be more appropriate technology for production compared
to the gas lift scheme of the RIL consortium, in a scenario where there
is uncertainty about the availability of the requisite amount of gas
from ONGC over the life of the contract". The TEC report will be
considered by a committee of secretaries with final award of the deal
to be decided by the cabinet.

GAIL SEEKS GAS PLAN PARTNERS

Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) is soliciting offers from private
investors by 15 February for a joint venture for distribution of
natural gas in Agra and Ferozabad towns of northern state Uttar
Pradesh. GAIL and the private sector promoters are to hold 26% stakes
each in the 2:1 debt-equity venture, estimated to cost Rs650m
($18.57m), with the balance of 48% equity to be subscribed by the state
government, local bodies and the public. The project is part of a 10-
point programme to reduce atmospheric pollution in the Taj Trapezium
area. GAIL says it will provide pipelines to city gate stations at the
outskirts of Agra and Ferozabad and the joint venture will further
distribute the gas to industrial units. The government has allocated
0.6 MMcmd of gas for distribution in the two towns.

UNION TEXAS/OXY IN LPG PLAN

Two US oil firms - Union Texas and Occidental Energy Venture Corp -
will set up an LPG extraction plant with a production capacity of
130,000 tonnes (t)/yr and a 132 MW gas-fired combined cycle power plant
at Badin, Sindh province. Total estimated cost of the two projects will
be $180m. A delegation of representatives of the two companies met
petroleum and natural resources minister Anwar Saifullah Khan in
Islamabad recently and said the proposed project would be based on
indigenous petroleum streams from the Badin Petroleum Concession block
awarded to Union Texas recently.

Saifullah said the Bhutto government would provide all possible
assistance for completion of the two projects. He asked the joint
venture delegation to ensure local private sector involvement in the
scheme as it would provide an opportunity to Pakistan's private sector
to learn technical know-how as well as encourage it to invest in the
petroleum sector.

PAKISTAN SET FOR NEW ROUND

Pakistan will shortly invite a second round of bidding for offshore oil
and natural gas projects, a petroleum and natural resources ministry
announcement said. "We hope to attract investments worth $9bn in oil
and gas exploration, $4.5bn in domestic pipelines and $6bn in refinery
facilities to cope with growing energy demand over the next 30 years,"
it added. The announcement further said international companies would
be invited to conferences in Houston and London in April to bid for
offshore oil and gas exploration in Pakistan. Preliminary response from
firms had been encouraging, it said.

FIELD NARROWS FOR $700M PROJECT

Nineteen out of 34 international consortia vying for the $700m natural
gas utilisation scheme in Burma have made it to the shortlist of the
Rangoon regime. The list includes seven Japanese heavyweights like
Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, a South Korean league of Daewoo, Hyundai
and Samsung, and groups consisting of Total and Unocal, Bechtel, Norsk
Hydro, British Gas as well as the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT)
and the Thai giant conglomerate Charoen Pokphand, according to sources
participating in the tender.

The bid calls for the rights to engage in the so-called "three-in-one"
project to utilise natural gas from Burma's known largest gasfield
Yadana, some 320 km south of Rangoon in the Gulf of Matarban. The
scheme involves construction of a 200 MW gas-fired power plant, a
570,000 tonnes (t)/yr urea fertiliser plant and a 250 km gasline to
transport Yadana gas ashore to the project site near the Burmese
capital.

Rangoon authorities have indicated to bidders they would be able to
announce a final decision on the choice of bidders in late January or
early February 1996. Due to magnitude of the scheme, the Burmese
government is expected to pick as many as five companies to undertake
work, rather than awarding the entire contract to just one company.

Industry sources clarified that Mitsui remains one of the contenders
though it may have provided some feasibility studies for the scheme to
Slorc last year (IGR 282/17). The three-in-one project will be based on
the 125 MMcfd of Yadana gas supply which the field production sharing
contractors including Total, Unocal Corp and PTT Exploration &
Production Plc (PTTEP) of Thailand will deliver to Rangoon under an
accord signed in February 1995 (IGR 269/21).

The majority of Yadana gas supply will be piped to Thailand under a 30-
year export contract concluded last February. The deal is for delivery
of 525 MMcfd of Yadana gas which will be used primarily for power
generation in Thailand. Yadana gas production is scheduled to start in
mid-1998.

UNIQUE/MITSUI CHASE MARKETS

Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Plc of Thailand and Japan's Mitsui & Co
will use their first joint venture on LPG and ammonia marketing in
Vietnam to spearhead into a wider range of energy-related businesses in
this socialist state. This strategic plan was outlined by senior
executives of the two firms specifically in a bid to capitalise on
extensive market opportunities in the country of 73m people.

That conforms with Unique Gas' target to expand its businesses in this
region and diversify its business lines beyond LPG and ammonia to
include other speciality gas, chemical and other products to become one
of Southeast Asia's leading chemical and energy concerns. Earlier last
year, Unique Gas formed a joint venture with Malaysia's state oil firm
Petronas to develop a network of service stations in Thailand offering
a full range of petroleum products under the Petronas brand name.

For Mitsui, the joint venture with Unique Gas in Vietnam forms an
integral part of its expansion of its businesses there where it has
been active in marketing fertiliser, among other areas. Unique Gas and
Petrochemicals (Vietnam) Co, equally owned by Unique Gas and Mitsui
group, early in December opened its $5.02m LPG and anhydrous ammonia
terminal in Long Thanh district of Dong Nai province, about 70 km south
of Ho Chi Minh City.

The terminal serves as platform for the joint venture to launch its LPG
and ammonia marketing in Vietnam where demand for those products is
expanding dramatically. Unique Gas president Phaibul Chalermsaphayakorn
and Mitsui & Co (Thailand)'s Hiroyuki Maruko said they were convinced
about "bright" economic growth potential.

Maruko said Unique Gas and Mitsui would broaden product lines in
Vietnam to include products like fuel oil in the near future. However,
execution of such a project was very much subject to Vietnamese
authorities' approval, a difficult and time consuming process, he said.
In spite of that, Mitsui, on its own part, will start looking into the
viability of setting up what would be the first LPG cylinder production
plant in Vietnam.

It has also been eyeing opportunities for establishing a natural gas
separation plant in Vietnam to process indigenous natural gas produced
from oil and gas fields off the country's southern coast, he added. For
Unique Gas, Phaibul noted the company has been assessing the
possibilities of establishing businesses including LPG distribution in
neighbouring countries, particularly Burma.

Established n 1982, Unique Gas has been active in distribution of LPG
and ammonia in Thailand. Vietnam is the first foreign country where
Unique Gas has an investment. The Unique Gas and Mitsui alliance in
Vietnam has had a firm plan to enlarge its operations in the country in
line with the expected dramatic jump in consumption of LPG. Phaibul
announced the joint venture plans to inject some $2m in additional
capital to boost the LPG storage capacity of its Long Thanh terminal
from the current level of 400 tons by 200 tons in February 1996 and
another 400 tons in 1997, so that at end-1997 combined capacity will be
1,000 tons.

Unique Gas Vietnam targets industrial users, especially those located
in Go Dau industrial zone where its terminal is situated, as its main
clientele for LPG, accounting for roughly 60% of its expected sales
volume of some 6,000 tons in 1996. The remaining 40% would be sales to
residential and commercial sectors in the form of cylinders. Unique Gas
Vietnam general director John Lu said total LPG and ammonia demand in
Vietnam was expected to more than double by 2000 and the company hoped
to grow with the market.

An industry estimate puts present LPG demand in Vietnam in the range of
4,000-5,000 tons a month. The Thai-Japanese joint venture expects to
capture a 10-15% share in Vietnam's LPG market currently dominated by
local suppliers like Saigon Petro, Elf Gas and Petrolimex - all with
local government participation.

Initial LPG supplies to Unique Gas Vietnam are from Thailand, Malaysia
and Indonesia. There is no local production of LPG in Vietnam. Unique
Gas Vietnam is the first wholly-owned foreign venture in LPG and
ammonia business to be licensed by the Vietnamese authorities. The
company's terminal covers an area of 111,000 sq metres; only a fraction
has been utilised. In Thailand, Unique Gas operates two LPG/ammonia
terminals in Bang Pakong and Surat Thani, two LPG tankers, 55 LPG road
tank trucks and 63 LPG bottling plants.

PTT MULLS HIGHER BURMA TAKE

Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) is considering raising its
purchase of natural gas from Burma's offshore Yadana field by 200-300
MMcfd over agreed contractual levels. PTT governor Pala Sookawesh spoke
of the possibility since the Yadana field developing group expects
higher gas productivity from the field and in light of additional gas
demand spurred by private power plant operators in Thailand under the
independent power producer (IPP) and small power producer (SPP)
programmes. He said recent information obtained from Yadana operator
Total indicated the field, some 320 km south of Rangoon in the Gulf of
Matarban, could prove additional gas reserves and deliverability.

According to PTT, Yadana's present certified recoverable gas reserves
are put at 5.7 Tcf. The 30-year contract PTT concluded with the Yadana
developing group in February 1995 calls for initial gas delivery of 141
MMcfd in mid-1998 before building up to 525 MMcfd 14 months later (IGR
268/16). Total executives have said earlier that Yadana is quite
productive and does not require Total to drill as many wells as
expected. Only some 10-15 wells would be needed in the initial stage to
achieve the contractual production level of some 500 MMcfd (IGR
270/18). Meanwhile, Pala said he had received assurance from parties
concerned that production and delivery of Yadana gas to PTT would start
within the contractual date.

Lately, Burmese ministers have also assured the PTT governor the
problem of most concern to PTT and the Yadana developing group - laying
of part of the gasline over areas in southeastern Burma where ethnic
Karen and Mon guerrillas have been waging war against the Rangoon
forces - would no longer pose a threat. They reportedly said the
southern part of the area holding most of the onshore section to the
Thai western province of Kanchanaburi was now controlled by ethnic Mons
allied with the Rangoon regime. The only problem at the border was the
minority Christian Karens who still dominated the area north of the
gasline route, though their Bhuddist faction had defected to the
government's Slorc. Pala said work related to the Yadana gas project on
the Burmese side, including the $1bn field development and the 300-plus
km off/onshore gasline was well under way.

CAMBODIA MULLS PTT MODEL

Cambodia has started considering establishment of a state oil firm to
manage its indigenous petroleum resources, particularly offshore
natural gas, which could be discovered and developed in future. Pou
Sotirak, Cambodian industry, mines and energy minister, said the
government had accepted it was the right time for the country to have a
"national" oil firm, possibly similar to those created in neighbouring
Asean states such as the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT). He
indicated the starting point would be when the country discovered
"practical" size resources, perhaps of Thailand's scale. "If we don't
have any reserves, then there is no need for a national oil company,"
he added.

Sotirak said he was "still thinking very hard" about the role of the
proposed national oil body. But generally Cambodia wanted to optimise
its economic exploitation of natural gas and petroleum, if it had any.
"It must serve the benefits of the public and the government." He said
he had asked PTT governor Pala Sookawesh if PTT could "teach a few
tricks" on establishing a national oil firm and developing personnel to
run the organisation.

"Right now we are still searching for petroleum (offshore); if we
discovered something I have to quickly visit Mr Pala to learn to
establish a national oil firm," he added. Cambodia has high hopes of
finding substantial natural gas reserves at locations near the so-
called overlapping areas of Thai-Cambodian territorial claims in the
Gulf of Thailand, given the fact Unocal Thailand has been producing gas
and condensate from the general area. Bangkok and Phnom Penh are still
unable to resolve their disputes over the offshore territorial claims,
said to be highly gas prospective.

Phnom Penh has mooted the idea that Thailand and Cambodia adopt a
"Joint Development Area (JDA)", as Thailand Malaysia have done, in
resolving the disputes in the southernmost part of the Gulf of
Thailand. Thailand has not accepted this, insisting on its claims on
the overlapping tract covering tens of thousands of square kilometres
(IGR 285/21).

HONDO WARNS GASLINE IN DOUBT

Hondo Oil & Gas Co this week warned completion of a Colombian natural
gas pipeline it plans with Amoco of the US is now in doubt because of
changes in Colombian regulations on pipeline tariffs and natural gas
prices. It also said the planned Opon 5 development well in the country
had been delayed indefinitely because of right of way disputes with
landowners. Hondo cited adoption of new regulations by recently formed
government agency Comision de Regulacion de Energia y Gas, part of the
mines and energy ministry.

It said the regulations set a ceiling price for natural gas and a
maximum 12.5% rate of return (before Colombian taxes) for pipeline
tariffs. The ceiling had been interpreted to include costs or fees for
natural gas processing, so that process costs could not be passed on to
buyers. "These new regulations will reduce the amount the company
expects to receive for natural gas and pipeline tariffs in the future,"
said a Hondo statement.

Earlier, Hondo said the new regulations affected terms agreed in a
memorandum of understanding announced last summer with Colombian state
oil and gas firm Ecopetrol for construction of an 88 km pipeline from
the Opon Association Contract (OPC) area to Ecopetrol's refinery at
Barancabermeja. This called for recovery of pipeline investment via a
tariff. Negotiations were continuing with Ecopetrol on relief from the
regulations' effects and meantime pipeline work was continuing, said
Hondo. Plans for 1996 OPC area exploration and development projects
would be reconsidered during the first quarter.

NEB DETAILS EXPORTS IMPACT

Total volumes of Canadian gas to be exported under long term contracts
up to 2014 represent 11% of remaining and undiscovered western Canada
reserves, according to the National Energy Board (NEB). Known and yet
to be found reserves totalled an estimated 164 Tcf at 1 November 1995
of which 63 Tcf was remaining reserves and 101 Tcf undiscovered, said
the board. Authorised volumes under long term contract totalled 18.2
Tcf. The volume did not include licences for gas exports from the
Mackenzie Delta totalling 9.2 Tcf. NEB said volumes authorised for long

HANSON SELLS SUBURBAN PROPANE

Industrial conglomerate Hanson has announced plans to sell a majority
equity stake in Suburban Propane, third biggest retail propane
distributor in the USA, through a public offer. Hanson expects to raise
about #500m ($776.3m) through the offer and a related debt issue. The
public offer will represent about 62% of equity in a new 'master
limited partnership' dubbed Suburban Propane Partners LP. Suburban will
also issue $425m of senior debt maturing in 2002-2011. Hanson will keep
an approximate 38% combined subordinated and general partnership
interest in the new MLP, it said.

The structure would enhance Suburban's ability to expand by using
partnership units to acquire other propane distributors. Suburban is
third largest retail and wholesale distributor of propane gas in the US
for residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural uses. Its
retail operations are run through 353 sales and service centres serving
nearly 0.8m customers in 39 states. Suburban has about 6% of the US
retail propane market, said Hanson. A substantial slice of net proceeds
from the unit offering and debt issue would be used to make payments to
Hanson subsidiaries.

FLYING START FOR MARITIMES LINE

A recent open season for Phase I of the planned Maritimes & Northeast
Pipeline project resulted in nominations for over 410 MMcfd of natural
gas transportation services, according to lSource Development Co, a
unit of Panhandle Eastern Corp, one of the line sponsors, early last
month. With announced initial capacity on Phase I just 60 MMcfd,
nominations far exceeded expectations, said 1Source. Phase 1, due to
start transportation services in 1997, comprises 63 miles of 24-inch
gasline linking Dracut, Massachusetts with Wells, Maine. Other sponsors
of the project to market natural gas from the Sable Island area
offshore Nova Scotia are Westcoast Energy Inc, Mobil Corp, Shell Canada
and Eastern Enterprises.

1Source said the open season response demonstrated the strong demand
for natural gas service in Maine and New Hampshire and the variety of
shippers nominating was evidence of a rapidly emerging, competitive
natgas marketplace there. "This is good news for the Maritimes &
Northeast project as a whole since Phase I is the project's gateway to
major markets in the eastern United States," said lSource. For Phase I
sponsors will now look to seal binding precedent agreements with future
Maritimes & Northeast customers, with federal approval to proceed
expected to be sought this month.

1Source said sponsors were keen to move ahead on Phase II for which it
expected the response in Maine and the Maritimes to be as encouraging.
The overall project will eventually involve construction of a 630 mile
underground pipeline crossing areas in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick in
Canada, Maine and New Hampshire before interconnecting with the North
American pipe grid in Massachusetts. Scheduled pipeline capacity is 400
MMcfd with service due to start in November 1999. Sable Offshore Energy
Project companies are Mobil, Shell Canada, Petro-Canada Inc, Imperial
Oil and Nova Scotia Resources Inc. They aim to tap about 3 Tcf of
recoverable natural gas from six fields in the Sable Island area.

CORPOVEN PLANS NGLS LEAP

State owned PDVSA unit Corpoven says it plans to boost natural gas
liquids (NGLs) output by some 160% over the next 10 years with output
expected to reach 6.22 Bcf in 2005 from 2.36 Bcf currently. It said the
forecast was based on "large proven reserves of natural gas" in
Venezuela totalling 138 Tcf of which Corpoven held 62%. The company
planned to invest 262bn bolivars ($771.6m) in various projects to boost
NGLs output. Main project was the Eastern Cryogenic Complex, or Accro,
in eastern Monagas state.

Its latest component, a $300m cryogenic plant, was inaugurated at Santa
Barbara last November. Third and final phase is due complete in 2004.
Accro output was expected to reach 290,000 b/d of NGLs by 2005 against
82,000 b/d now. Up to 30% of Venezuelan gas liquids are exported,
mainly to the USA. Corpoven estimates market capacity in the Americas
at about 150,000 b/d.

SHV CALOR EXPANDS IN BRAZIL

The international LPG joint venture of Calor Group of the UK and Dutch
SHV Energy is spending $62m for a 49% stake (with 50% voting rights) in
Supergasbras Distribuidora de Gas, Brazil's fourth largest LPG
distributor. The two partners in SHV Calor Brasil are investing $31m
each. The deal follows acquisition last August of a majority stake in
Minasgas, Brazil's fifth largest bottled gas supplier. Calor said the
two firms would be operated as separate companies but it would
encourage the rival suppliers to make cooperation arrangements for the
future. The two supply a combined total of 1.35m tonnes/yr of LPG to
over 40m people.

Last summer Calor unveiled plans to spend about #70m ($108.7m) on
projects in Asia and Latin America, in conjunction with SHV which has a
controlling stake in Calor, seeking to reduce its dependence on the UK
LPG market. Calor financial controller John Taylor this week said the
group had about #40m to spend on other projects, mostly in Asia.

CPUC SEEKS POWER COMPETITION

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is back in the
precedent-setting business with a late December move to bring
competition to all electric power sales in the Golden State. The broad
deregulation plan, a refinement and stretch-out of the pioneering free-
market initiative launched by the commission last April, will affect
virtually every aspect of the $20bn California electricity market. In
the process, it may be the beginning of the end for CPUC itself, at
least as presently constituted. And, like so many other things
Californian, it is likely to serve as a bellwether for other state
commissions seeking a roadmap to successful deregulation of their own
electric utilities.

For gas interests, the CPUC move is expected to result, at least
eventually, in a further proliferation of small-scale, independent
power production facilities, most of which are likely to be fired by
natural gas. "Market mechanisms", said CPUC, will be used "to minimise
transition costs [and] utilities will be allowed the opportunity for
full recovery of the transition costs associated with existing power
contracts and prior regulatory commitments".

The commission added it would also permit "accelerated recovery of net
book value of undepreciated assets combined with a reduced cost of
capital". However, the new plan was approved on a sharply divided 3-2
vote of the commissioners, signalling lengthy fights before
deregulation in California becomes a fait accompli. And the plan must
receive concurrence from California Governor Pete Wilson and from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Ferc).

Timing of the transition to open markets remains ambitious:
deregulation would begin in less than two years, on 1 January 1998,
continuing through the first day of 2003 when power markets would
become completely open. In a repeat of part of its original proposal
that resulted in extensive criticism from various energy industry
sectors, the new CPUC plan includes preferences for "renewable" fuels
and penalties for failure to achieve minimum purchase requirements for
power generated using environmentally benign technologies.

The new regulatory regime would also use "performance-based" criteria
to spur operational efficiency at the state's utilities. CPUC said it
would strive during first-quarter 1996 to achieve a "California
Consensus" among state and local officials and electricity customers.
The commission pledged to submit the envisaged consensus to Ferc in
what it termed "a spirit of cooperative federalism", and what cynics
suggested was an end run to co-opt the Washington regulators.

Rather than phasing the deregulation plan in by customer classes, the
new CPUC plan would select a "representative" group from all customers
for participation in the first phase two years hence. That initial move
into uncharted waters would last just one year, during which selected
customers could shop around among electricity providers for the best
deals. After that, full open market conditions would be implemented.

State regulation of rates and services would continue in instances
where true competition did not occur, said CPUC, although traditional
cost-of-service standards would be supplanted by overall performance
criteria. In the CPUC view, that would lead to increased profit
potential for the most efficient producers and investor penalties for
those who failed to cut costs sufficiently.

To assure open transmission access for all power producers, the CPUC
system would establish an "independent system operator" (ISO) to assume
control of utility-owned transmission assets and manage the use of
those resources. The ISO would also be responsible for assuring
adequate power supplies and reliability of transmission facilities, as
well as fixing any problems that develop. In short, major utilities
could continue to own transmission properties but could not operate
them independently of the ISO.

In an element likely to be among its most controversial, the CPUC plan
would require California's Big Three electric utilities - Pacific Gas
and Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas and
Electric - to divest half their fossil-fired generation facilities if
they wish to avoid "market power" accusations. Another "politically
correct" aspect of the CPUC decision would require a "public goods
charge" on retail electricity sales, with proceeds to be used to fund
energy conservation and efficiency initiatives "not provided by the
competitive market that are in the broader public interest".

CPUC also mandated that electric rates include a "competition
transition charge" that could not be bypassed in sales transactions.
That charge would be collected from all power consumers, whether they
receive conventional bundled service from utilities or buy power
directly from independent producers. As the dust began to settle on the
CPUC announcement, gas industry analysts were hedging their bets on
exactly what the impact might be on gas use.

However, most observers concurred that if the plan is endorsed by the
governor and by Ferc, the increased access of independent generators
would inevitably favour greater gas use in California. If other states
choose to copy California once more, the consensus is that gas use for
power generation could increase substantially, with few observers
willing to speculate on precise growth figures.

COLD SPARKS PRICE SPIKE

Abnormally cold weather in the eastern half of the US, combined with a
perception among traders that gas storage inventories are declining
rapidly enough to raise questions about sufficiency of gas supplies
through the 31 March end of the winter heating season, produced an
unprecedented upward spike in gas futures prices on the New York
Mercantile Exchange during the week before Christmas, with high prices
for the January futures contract climbing close to $4/MMBtu in daily
trading before settling back into the $3.00 range for the week.

The abrupt jump also marked the highest gas futures prices on the Nymex
since trading in those instruments began. As the New Year's holiday
weekend began, gas futures contracts were trading back in the $2.50
range. Traders appeared more worried this season about the "early" cold
snaps that have occurred in the eastern US. While periods of
exceptionally cold weather in the last several years have often been
colder and more prolonged than those in recent days, they occurred
closer to the end of the winter season, when concerns about the season-
long adequacy of gas supplies were less severe.

Questions along the lines of "can we make it until April?" have
occurred with increasing frequency. For the week ending 22 December,
the American Gas Association reported gas in storage totalled 2,257
Bcf, or 70% "full". For the same reporting period last year, storage
volumes were nearly 400 Bcf higher, and inventories stood at 83% full.
Spot wellhead gas prices rose by 25 cents/MMBtu to $2.30 during the
week before Christmas, closing at 83 cents more than the year-earlier
week. For the week between Christmas and New Year, prices rose another
29 cents to $2.59, closing at $1.15/MMBtu above the year-end week of
1994. Meanwhile, figures for average spot wellhead prices for full year
1995 came out at $1.45/MMBtu.

The dramatic increases in gas futures prices during the year's last
fortnight gave rise to a formal complaint filed by an ad-hoc group
calling itself "the Nymex floor members", seeking an investigation by
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission into the volatile fluctuations
in gas futures contract prices just before the end of the year. The
leap of 94.4 cents/MMBtu registered by the January gas futures contract
between 18 December and the closing of the January contract on 21
December brought the contract price to $3.448/MMBtu, a record for the
contract. Representatives of Nymex insisted the price volatility was a
natural result of exceptionally strong gas demand, rather than any
mismanagement or wrongdoing on the part of the exchange or individual
traders.

NEW PIPE TALLY 8,000 MILES

More than 8,000 miles of new US natural gas transmission line or
pipeline looping have been built, are under construction or are
proposed, according to the American Gas Association (AGA) in its latest
annual report on new construction. Additionally, AGA lists 47 proposed
natural gas storage projects in various stages of development to add
more than 500 Bcf of working gas storage capacity and, if built,
increase total US working gas storage capacity by nearly 20%.

Through 1993 and 1994, more than $9bn of new gas pipeline construction
projects were in various stages of development. AGA classifies these
projects as either built in 1993 or 1994 and operational, or currently
under construction, proposed and pending. In aggregate, the projects
total 8,087 miles of new line and looping, 1,098,940 hp of additional
compression, and 15.3 Bcfd of additional capacity. The existing US gas
transmission network consists of more than 2,984,500 miles of line and
more than 14m hp of compression with a total book value of nearly
$54bn.

ENGINE IN SCHOOL BUS EXAM

Engineers at South-western Research Institute, San Antonio are
developing an electronically controlled natural gas engine for school
and commercial buses. Based on an existing PowerTech Deere natural gas
engine, it is part of an Energy Department-funded project to build safe
school buses powered by natural gas. The modified 8.1 litre engine has
electronic fuel injection, an electronic drive-by-wire throttle
actuator, an electronically controlled wastegate and a direct-fire,
coil-on-plug ignition system.

So far, it is said to have demonstrated low emission levels with better
performance and fuel efficiency than any heavy-duty, natural gas engine
commercially available. Deere plans to produce a commercial version of
this engine this year. The engine is currently undergoing lean-misfire
and knock-limit tests to determine operating limits. Researchers are
also identifying the influence of various engine components on
performance and emissions with the goal of lowering nitrogen oxide
output while maintaining engine efficiency.

During the next several months, they will evaluate different control
strategies for keeping the desired air-fuel ratio, spark timing, boost
pressure and other parameters during steady-state and transient
operation. They are also developing systems for knock and misfire
detection and catalyst efficiency monitoring. Once proven, the engine
will go into a prototype, ultrasafe bus being designed by Blue Bird
Corp. Natural gas will be stored in four composite-wrapped aluminium
cylinders located within the frame rails underneath the bus which is
expected to have a range of more than 300 miles. Besides sporting a new
engine, the ultrasafe bus will be lighter weight for optimum fuel
efficiency.

ELTRON IN NEW SYNGAS R&D

Eltron Research Inc is developing a 'ceramic membrane reactor' (CMR)
technology for electrochemical conversion of humidified natural gas to
synthesis gas. In addition to the yield being up to 90% in a single
pass, the reaction is thermodynamically spontaneous and therefore
requires no externally imposed voltage. Further, it needs no external
source of pure oxygen, cutting production costs by 30-50%, says project
manager Michael Schwartz. Maintained at some 900oC, the CMR is equipped
with a tubular mixed-conducting membrane with methane held inside and
the air (for O2) outside.

The methane side of the membrane is coated with a partial-oxidation
catalyst, while the outer side contains a reduction catalyst. The high
conductivity of the membrane materials for electrons and oxygen ions
permits the reaction of oxygen with methane while preventing direct
contact between methane and oxygen. In addition, oxygen becomes
separated from atmospheric nitrogen via the membrane. Eltron is seeking
partners to build a largescale CMR prototype.

BUYERS TO HOOK INTO US SYSTEM

Late this year, Mexico's PMI Trading Co hopes to take delivery of the
first NGLs shipped through newly-formed Rio Grande Pipeline Co. The
latter is a new joint venture formed by Mid-America Pipeline, Amoco
Pipelines and Navajo Pipeline companies to link the US NGL grid to its
southern neighbour. Liquids will originate at Hobbs Station, Texas and
other points on Mid-America Pipeline's 16,000 km system to the Pemex
Gas y Petroquimica Basica Mendez terminal in Ciudad Juarez.

To achieve this, Rio Grande is buying Navajo's existing 8-inch pipeline
from Odessa, Texas to a point near El Paso. A new 8-inch line will link
this point to the Mendez terminal in Mexico. Mid-America will be
operator of the system. Volume to be moved has yet to be announced.

NEW INDIANA PLANT ON STREAM

PSI Energy and Destec Energy have begun commercial operations at their
joint venture coal gasification plant at West Terre Haute in Indiana.
The Wabash River plant has taken two years to build and will convert
2,7000 tonnes/day of high-sulphur coal - supplied from Peabody Coal's
Hawthorn mine in the state - to an ultimate 262,000 kW of electricity.
The latter will stem from PSI's existing Wabash River coal-fired plant,
being converted to a syngas-fired combined-cycle unit. Destec
technology is being used throughout. In the gasification plant, the
company claims to remove 98% of the coal's sulphur content prior to
gasification.

That seems set to be sold for use in fertiliser production. Air
pollution is said to be just a fraction of the limit set for 2000 by
the Clean Air Act. Acid rain pollutants are also said to be reduced
significantly. A further by-product is ash derived from the
gasification plant. This is converted to an inert vitrous aggregate
said to be ideal for road building. Now Destec aims to use the same
technology to use unsaleable residues from refineries as basic fuel for
gasification.

CMS BUYS PETAL STORAGE

CMS Gas Transmission and Storage Co has bought Chevron's Petal Gas
Storage Co for an undisclosed sum. As part of the sale agreement,
Chevron will continue to receive long-term storage service from Petal,
which owns a high-deliverability peak-shaving storage unit in Forrest
County, Mississippi. With a capacity of 3.2 Bcf, the salt-dome cavern
provides up to 320 MMcfd delivery for up to 10 days and can be refilled
in 20 days. At present it is connected to two interstate pipelines -
Tennessee Gas and Koch Gateway.

Access to other pipelines is being mulled by CMS, along with the
possibility of expansion. "We believe Petal's high-flexible peaking
type of service is what the market wants," says William Haener,
president at CMS Gas Transmission & Storage. The company complements
CMS' existing storage business and will allow the latter to tailor
specific services to satisfy a wide variety of customer needs, he adds.

BECHTEL LANDS LNG EPC CONTRACT

Atlantic LNG Co of Trinidad and Tobago has taken two major decisions
which will ensure it maintains its deadline for delivering LNG to its
two customers, Cabot and Enagas, by first-quarter 1999. One is choice
of the Phillips optimised cascade system, developed by Phillips
Petroleum Co, as the preferred liquefaction process for the 425 MMcfd
plant. Overseas Bechtel, one of three companies asked to submit front
end engineering design for the plant, based its proposals on the
Phillips process and has been awarded the engineering, procurement and
construction (EPC) contract.

Negotiations on an overall contract price will begin with Bechtel in
January, led by Atlantic's recently-appointed vice president for
engineering and construction, David Jamieson. Ground should be broken
for construction early in the second quarter. The other major decision
is to break that ground elsewhere than at La Brea, the site in
southwest Trinidad originally chosen for LNG, mainly on the insistence
of the last government, which wanted to develop the area.

But the abandoned wells left behind from discontinued oil and gas
operations could not be cleaned up in time and the existence of the
nearby Pitch Lake meant the area would remain inherently unstable
geologically. The LNG site has been shifted five miles further down the
southwest coast to Point Fortin, where ample reclaimed land and good
harbour facilities, which have accommodated oil tankers for decades,
are available.

The move will also help provide alternative jobs for workers made
redundant by closure of Petrotrin's Point Fortin refinery, which is
imminent because no one seems interested in buying it. Bechtel beat two
other contenders to the prize contract, likely to be worth close to
$1bn. Chiyoda Corp/Hudson Engineering had offered an LNG design based
on the Air Products and Chemicals liquefaction process and a joint
venture of MW Kellogg and JGC Corp also submitted a bid.

Atlantic believes its strategy of inviting engineering designs first
and then awarding an EPC contract was the best way to control project
costs. As David Wight, president of Amoco Trinidad, whose associate
company, Amoco Trinidad LNG, owns 34% of Atlantic, says: "We now have a
good idea of what our costs are going to be and can control them."

GASLINE PLANS 'MAKE PROGRESS'

Negotiations on the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline continue apace and
according to a consultant close to the action there has been concrete
progress "with all technical and planning aspects in place". He was
referring to the pipeline being built in two Brazilian sections, with
completion of the Corumba-Sao Paulo section before that from Sao Paulo
to Port Alegre instead of simultaneously. The pipeline diameter has
been fixed at 32 inches (instead of 28 inches) permitting a maximum
volume of 30 MMcmd rather than 16 MMcmd.

The source said: "There are no problems with existing legislation for
the pipeline to go ahead; all that is really needed is long term
distribution contracts with utilities. All the partners (Enron, YPFB,
Petrobras, British Gas, Tenneco and BHP) are basically in agreement."
Asked about the pipeline's timetable, the consultant put a dateline of
mid-1996 for all existing problems to be overcome and a "very
conservative and cautious maximum timescale for contracts for gas power
projects to be signed and capable of seeking finance by April 1997".

One major reason for cheerfulness for the companies involved in the
gasline project was a decision by Brazil's federal electricity holding
Eletrobras to include gas-fired power for the very first time in its
revised long-term plan (1996-2004) to be published this January. Enron
has always argued the Bolivian pipeline must be primed by electricity
generating projects from day one of operation so that it is producing
money from the start while industrial and residential markets are
developed.

The Eletrobras plan for gas-fuelled generation consists of 1,800 MW in
the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, 450 MW in Mato Grosso and
390 MW in Mato Grosso do Sul. The Bolivia pipeline will enter Brazil at
Mato Grosso do Sul (Corumba) and go straight to the contiguous state of
Sao Paulo where the main market is. Sao Paulo currently takes gas from
Rio de Janeiro state but when Bolivian gas arrives this flow is planned
to be reversed.

A branch pipeline will probably leave the Bolivia-Brazil main pipeline
within Bolivia (between Santa Cruz de la Serra and Puerto Suarez) in
order to serve Mato Grosso state, probably entering Brazilian territory
at the river port of Caceres. Enron is understood to have signed
protocols of understanding for establishing gas-fired power stations
with the state electricity companies of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do
Sul.

There are apparently two issues still to be resolved. One is the
question of the gas price to distribution companies. Negotiations are
centred on the equation of volume and prices. The pipeline project
companies have been arguing for high volumes and lower prices while
distribution company estimates of demand have tended to be conservative
and consequently the price offered has tended to rise. The use of gas
in power stations will go some way to breaking this particular log-jam
by raising initial throughput and lowering the price.

Another problem, aired for some time, has been the allegation that
Bolivian reserves will be insufficient for the projected gasline flows.
Opponents of the gas pipeline say the certified reserves (by
Netherlands, Sweel and Associates of Dallas) do not cover the estimated
100 Bcm Brazil would consume over the 20 year contract period. The
respected Dallas company put Bolivian reserves at 80.8 Bcm proven; 30
Bcm probable and 25.9 Bcm possible. The consultant was confident this
problem "could be settled fairly quickly", without specifying how.

GAS VEHICLE PRODUCTION OK'D

Brazil's mines and energy minister Raimundo Brito has authorised the
motor industry to start production of natural gas fuelled cars and
trucks. Until now only buses have been purpose-built to use gas while
taxis could be converted to the fuel. Ministry officials expect the
cars will be produced with the option of alcohol use in order to
increase their range outside major cities. One of the reasons given for
allowing gas-fuelled car production is the increasing levels of
pollution in the two Brazilian cities with developed natural gas road
vehicle infrastructure: Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

US INVOLVEMENT NOW LIKELY

One at least of the new ammonia/urea complexes planned for location at
Jose in Antzotegui state Venezuela is set for US participation (IGR
287/25). Pequiven has signed a letter of intent with Arcadian to
jointly study feasibility of a $700m project involving a 700,000
tonnes/yr (t/yr) urea plant, fed by twin 600,000 t/yr ammonia units.
Assuming the study is positive and finance can be secured, Arcadian
sees a construction period running to three years. The move, says
Arcadian president Doug Campbell, would allow the company to move into
the fast-growing Latin American market for agriculture fertilisers,
with Venezuela's hefty gas reserves making that country a natural place
from which to operate.

CRISTOBAL NEEDS HIGHER PRICE

Partners in Sucre Gas SA, the joint venture backing the planned
Cristobal-Colon LNG export project, will wait until late 1996 before
committing themselves to a go-ahead. So says Ronald Pantin, planning
chief at Petroven, whose Lagoven subsidiary holds 33% of Sucre. For the
project to be economically viable, says Pantin, prices in the US will
have to be $2.50/MMBtu, while those in Europe will have to hit
$3.50/MMBtu. On recent forecasts (IGR 288/18), pipeline gas from almost
any source will undercut the European price suggested, US prices may
well top the $2.50/MMBtu level by end-century (IGR 285/30) but the
spate of new gas being released by the price-rise-inspired exploration
hike puts some doubt on higher prices lasting for long.

volume needed to keep reserves from declining.

It forecasts Canadian gas production will increase from a current 4.5
Tcf/yr to more than 6 Tcf/yr by 2005. On the price side, it projected
prices rising to about $4/Mcf by 2010, or $2.50/Mcf after adjustment
for inflation.

Bangkok, by 5,000 tons.

Installation of three additional LPG spheres and related loading and
unloading facilities as part of the expansion of Khao Bor Ya terminal
is expected complete by 1997.

The expansion facilitates a significant increase of LPG throughput
volume at the terminal, resulting from a substantial rise in locally-
produced LPG and the need to export surplus LPG which is expected to be
453,000 tons.

to the usual natural gas to methanol route, allowing petrochemical
firms to vary end product according to state of the markets.

Using a fluidised-bed reactor and a highly-selective molecular-sieve

SIAM CEMENT AND DOW CHEMICAL JOINT VENTURE TO PRODUCE LLDPE

Thailand - Siam Cement, one of Thailand's largest conglomerates, and US-
based Dow Chemical announced a 4.75bn baht ($190m) joint venture to set
up a linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) production facility in
Thailand.

The new plant, designed to produce 30,000 tonnes/yr (t/yr) of LLDPE,
will strengthen SCC's production capacity of polyethylene and propylene
and its derivatives to 1mt/yr in 1999, said to be the largest scale in
Asia.

According to SCC petrochemicals vice president Apiporn Pasawat, SCC and
Dow have incorporated Siam Polyethylene Co with a registered capital of
1.5bn baht to carry out the venture.

The two parties have an equal share in the scheme, to be located in Mab
Ta Phud Industrial Estate, Rayong. The plant, to be built on
technologies supplied by Dow, is scheduled on stream in 1999. Dow has
already been a partner with SCC in four other petrochemical projects.

Thai Polyethylene Co, part of Siam Cement, is currently the country's
sole producer of LLDPE with an annual production of 80,000 t/yr.

MITI to strengthen supervision of power plants+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will
instruct operators of electric power facilities under its
jurisdiction to establish a safety system for their operation, a
senior MITI official said Monday.
     MITI will urge power plant operators to step up training and
inspection to prevent accidents, and ensure a system for an immediate
reporting to the ministry in the case of emergency, said Tomio
Tsutsumi, vice MITI minister, during a news conference.
     Tsutsumi was apparently referring to the recent attempt by the
operator of the Monju prototype fast-breeder reactor to cover up the
extent of an accident.
     Monju and other atomic power plants are under the jurisdiction
of the Science and Technology Agency while ordinary power reactors
are supervised by MITI.
     A large amount of sodium leaked at Monju on Dec. 8, forcing the
plant's shutdown.
     A government organ in charge of running Monju has been under
fire for deliberately editing or withholding videotape taken inside
the plant shortly after the accident.

Crude Oil imports fall 8.8% in Nov.++

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan's imports of crude oil in November decreased 8.8% from a
year before, posting the fourth consecutive month of year-to-year
declines, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
said Monday.
     The decline was in reaction to a sizable year-to-year gain of
14.6% registered in November last year when domestic fuel oil demand
surged due to a drought in the nation earlier in the year, MITI
officials said.
     The United Arab Emirates was the biggest supplier of crude oil
in November with 37.61 million barrels, down 9.5% from a year before.
     The UAE was followed by Saudi Arabia with 24.34 million
barrels, down 19.4%, Iran with 13.96 million barrels, up 5.2%, and
Indonesia with 11.28 million barrels, down 23.3%, MITI said.
     Of the total imports, those from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries accounted for 82.3%, up from 80.6% in October,
while imports via the Strait of Hormuz represented 72.1%, down from
72.7%.
     Imports from the Middle East reached 78.9%, unchanged.
     The amount of crude oil processed during the reporting month
came to 128.32 million barrels, down 3.3%, MITI said.
     Production of fuel oil in November sank 3.0% to 119.57 million
barrels, the first decline in three months, MITI said.
     Output of naphtha, jet fuel oil and heavy oil decreased but that
of gas oil and gasoline hit record highs.
     Domestic sales of fuel oil came to 130.89 million barrels, up
3.6%.
     Sales of fuel oil B and fuel oil C slid but others increased,
with gasoline, naphtha, gas oil and jet fuel oil reaching record
highs for any November.
     Imports of fuel oil surged 39.2% to 19.00 million barrels but
exports sank 10.8% to 9.62 million barrels, MITI said.

TEPCO to pay more than 2 bil. yen over labor dispute+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) signed an agreement Monday to
pay more than 2 billion yen in compensation to 165 employees for
discriminating against them on grounds that they are communists.
     The agreement, reached out of court under a proposal by the
Tokyo High Court after a 19-year legal battle, also calls for
promotion and fair treatment for those still on the payroll.
     ''This has been a very long legal battle that lasted 19 years
and two months and we all are happy now.  I'm confident that this
will help promote liberty and democracy for the basic rights of
workers,'' said Hideo Nihei, who led the plaintiffs.
     ''We decided to reach an out-of-court settlement in view of the
circumstances surrounding the case such as the court proposal and the
long duration of the trial,'' a TEPCO spokesman said.
     The plaintiffs first took their case to court in 1976, demanding
the company pay a total of some 3.7 billion yen in damages for
discriminating against them in wages and promotion due their beliefs
as members of the Japanese Communist Party.
     TEPCO had justified the wage differentials, saying they
reflected the employees' job performances.
     The high court recommended an out-of-court settlement last
December.

MITI to rectify notorious LPG trading practices+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The Ministry of International Trade and Industry will try to
rectify practices related to the trading of liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG), ministry officials said Monday.
     To answer consumer criticism that the LPG price system is
unclear, the ministry is considering revising the Law Concerning the
Securing of Safety and the Optimization of Transactions of Liquefied
Petroleum Gas.
     When the ministry reviews the law, it plans to include penalties
to prevent inappropriate trading practices from having adverse
effects on consumers.
     The move will be made because a subcommittee of the Petroleum
Council, an advisory body to the international trade and industry
minister, called for rectification of LPG transactions in its interim
report issued Monday.
     The report proposed that how LPG prices are calculated should be
written on paper, which traders will issue when they sign contracts.
The ownership of pipes and equipment in houses will also be made
clear, the report also said.
     The ministry will issue a ministerial ordinance to force traders
to make clear on paper such things as prices and ownership of pipes
and equipment.
     To punish traders who do not issue such papers, the ministry
will revise the law.  A bill designed to revise the law will be
presented before the next ordinary Diet session.

Oil industry makes political donations to ruling parties+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The Petroleum Association of Japan disclosed Friday it has made
political donations to two conservative parties in the ruling
coalition in response to their requests.
     The association of oil producers and distributors said 60
million yen went to the Liberal Democratic Party, the main force in
the tripartite ruling coalition, and 3.5 million yen to New Party
Sakigake, the coalition's smallest party.
     Last year, the association donated 50 million yen to the LDP.
It increased its donation in order to strengthen its ties with the
party in response to a request by the powerful Federation of Economic
Organizations (Keidanren), association officials said.
     Keidanren asked member organizations and corporations to
contribute funds to help the LDP repay 10 billion yen borrowed from
commercial banks to finance its campaign for the general election in
July 1993.

Miyagi Pref. takes dim view of leak at reactor+

SENDAI, Japan, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Miyagi prefectural authorities said Monday they take a
''serious view'' of a leak of water at a reactor operated by Tohoku
Electric Power Co. in the prefecture in northern Japan despite the
company's assurance that it involved only a minute release of
radioactivity.
     The leak occurred near a hygroscopic moisture heat separator on
the plant's No. 2 reactor at Onagawa, a light-water, boiling water
type with an 825,000-kilowatt power output.
     Operators began shutting down the reactor manually on Sunday
night after the leak was discovered and completed the process by
midday Monday, after which they began investigating the cause of the
leak.
     Yutaka Suto, head of the company's nuclear power division, told
a press conference that radioactivity in the coolant water amounted
to ''a mere trace.''
     Prefectural officials counter by saying they view the case as
''an extremely serious mishap'' since the reactor had only recently
begun operations in July.
     An investigation by prefectural and company officials indicates
that the site of the problem was a device that adjusts the high water
mark on a drain tank on a second stage heater forming part of a
hygroscopic moisture heat separator installed to more effectively
remove steam generated in the reactor.
     At 6:15 p.m. Sunday, operators found water leaked from the
heater between the high- and low-pressure turbines.
     When the most recent inspection was carried out Dec. 10, no
abnormality was found.

Antinuclear group calls for Monju reactor closure+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A citizens' group opposed to the development of nuclear power
plants petitioned the head of the Science and Technology Agency on
Monday, demanding the fast-breeder nuclear reactor Monju be closed
immediately.
     The Citizens' Nuclear Information Center, in a letter to agency
chief Yasuoki Urano, also demanded that the agency reconsider its
plans to use plutonium in nuclear reactors in Japan's energy
development plans.
     Jinzaburo Takagi, executive director of the center, said the
agency should have known that the government-funded Power Reactor and
Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. (Donen), which operates the prototype
reactor, was concealing the accident.
     ''If (the agency) did not know, it has lost its power as a
manager,'' said Takagi.
     On Dec. 8, liquid sodium from the reactor's secondary cooling
system leaked and forced a shutdown of the reactor in Tsuruga, Fukui
Prefecture along the Sea of Japan coast.
     The group is also demanding that information concerning
investigations into the accident be made available to the public.
     ''The agency has not answered criticism from the outside, and
has given birth to a situation in which it is essentially protecting
Donen,'' said Takagi.

Donen rapped for improper system to handle Monju leak+

FUKUI, Japan, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The Fukui prefectural government, host to the prototype
fast-breeder reactor Monju that was shut down after a huge sodium
leak, criticized the reactor's operator Monday for lacking the
necessary system to deal with such accidents.
     The prefectural government made the criticism against the
government-funded Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp.
(Donen) in a report on the Dec. 8 accident at the plant located in
Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan coast.
     In the report, the local government said that the management of
sodium coolant is basic to operating a fast-breeder reactor, but with
the present system and equipment at the Monju reactor, Donen is
unable to act promptly after a sodium leak.
     The prefectural government also rapped Donen for its delay in
informing the public of the accident.
     Donen reshuffled three senior officials who withheld videotapes
taken at the site of the accident.  The three officials withheld the
videotapes in an attempt to cover up the extent of the leak.
     A panel of the three-party ruling coalition discussing the Monju
accident agreed Monday to send a fact-finding mission to the reactor
site in Tsuruga early next year, coalition officials said.
     The coalition panel also agreed to reconsider, if necessary,
government policy promoting nuclear fuel recycling, in which
plutonium is removed from spent nuclear fuel to be reprocessed for
use as nuclear fuel again, they said.
     It is one of Japan's major energy policies, and the government
aims to put the system into practical use in the first half of the
21st century.
     Meanwhile, Donen officials said the corporation is considering
diverting more than half the plutonium shipped from France three
years ago for use at the Monju reactor to other reactors.
     The officials said Donen is considering the move due to the
indefinite delay of operations at Monju following the sodium leak.
     Donen decided to shift the plutonium because Monju requires
high-grade plutonium and current stocks could degrade if stored for
an long period, the officials said.
     Japan shipped 1 ton of plutonium from a reprocessing plant in
France amid protests from countries along the shipping route.
     At the time, Donen and the Science and Technology Agency said
the shipment was a vital replacement fuel for Monju.
     But because of delays at a factory in Japan making plutonium for
Monju, the processing of the imported plutonium did not begin until
December 1994.
     Some 600 kilograms, or more than half the transported amount, is
still unprocessed and in storage at the village of Tokai in Ibaraki
Prefecture, northeast of Tokyo.
     A Donen official said the fuel could be used at an experimental
fast reactor known as Joyo at Oarai in Ibaraki Prefecture and at a
prototype heavy-water reactor known as Fugen in Tsuruga.
     The diversion of the fuel would not involve major problems in
regard to nuclear fuel treaties with France and the United States,
but Japan would have to explain its actions to gain international
understanding, the Donen officials said.

Agency publishes revised report on Monju sodium leak+

TSURUGA, Japan, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Science and Technology Agency on Tuesday published a
revised report on a coolant leak at the prototype fast-breeder
nuclear reactor Monju after the first report submitted by its
operator turned out to have been falsified.
     The revised report was submitted to the agency Monday by the
operator, the governmental Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development
Corp. (Donen).  It contains corrections on the first report submitted
last week.
     The revised report says the time at which the first inspection
at the accident site was made was 2 a.m. Dec. 9, instead of 10 a.m.
on the day as reported previously.
     The new report also includes detailed chronological records on
contacts between Donen and the local and central governments since
immediately after the accident in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, on the
Sea of Japan coast.
     Meanwhile, Donen on Tuesday dismissed another senior official in
charge of the controversial nuclear plant over the cover-up attempt
to conceal the extent of the sodium leak that forced the shutdown of
the plant Dec. 8.
     Donen, which has been accused of editing and withholding videos
taken inside the plant shortly after the accident, said Tadao
Takahashi, a director in charge of Monju operations, will be replaced
by Atsuhiko Kishida.
     The corporation dismissed three officials last weekend over the
issue -- Yasuhito Omori, who headed construction works at the Monju
plant, his deputy Isao Sato and Futoshi Maeda, a section chief.
     At the Monju plant, a specially established working group of the
government's Nuclear Safety Commission launched a probe into the
accident Tuesday.
     The group has been set up to clarify the causes of the accident
and recommend steps for the prevention of a recurrence.
     The group will conduct a separate investigation, independent of
the Science and Technology Agency's inspection team.
     Meanwhile, the Tsuruga municipal assembly handed agency chief
Yasuoki Urano a statement saying that the city will not allow the
reactor to be restarted until after it is convinced of its safety.

2nd high-level nuclear waste shipment to Japan postponed+

AOMORI, Japan, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The planned second shipment of high-level nuclear waste from
France to Japan's nuclear recycling plant in the village of Rokkasho
in northern Japan has been delayed, electric companies and Japan
Nuclear Fuel Ltd. said Tuesday.
     France's state-owned nuclear fuel company COGEMA, which
reprocesses Japan's spent nuclear fuel, has not yet drawn up a plan
for the transportation, Japan Nuclear Fuel officials said.
     In April, the British ship Pacific Pintail, owned by British
Nuclear Fuels Ltd., carried the first shipment of high-level
radioactive waste in 28 vitrified blocks from France, where it was
created as a byproduct of reprocessing spent nuclear fuel on behalf
of Japanese electric power companies.
     The shipment of the waste is the first of several that Japan has
planned over the next decade, in which over 3,000 vitrified blocks of
waste will be shipped to Japan after spent nuclear fuel is
reprocessed by COGEMA and British Nuclear Fuels.
     Another 96 vitrified blocks were to be brought to the Rokkasho
plant in Aomori Prefecture in the second half of fiscal 1995, through
the end of March 1996.
     The waste would then be buried deep underground, but a final
storage site has not yet been decided.
     The April shipment drew strong protests from the countries
along the shipment route as well as from environment protection
organizations and local residents in Aomori Prefecture.

IN FACE OF MSHA CIVIL PENALTIES, FINES
J&T COAL CO. FILES FOR CHAPTER 7

     A Lee County, Va. coal company faced with more
than $320,000 in civil penalties, and even more in
potential criminal fines from a fatal roof fall, has
filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in federal court.
     J&T Coal cited a lack of assets for its filing.
J&T's deep mine in St. Charles, Va. was the site of a
massive roof fall that left four workers dead (MRR
3/1/91, p. 85).
     Earlier this spring J&T was convicted in U.S.
District Court on six criminal counts in connection
with the fatal accident (MRR 3/26). That ruling
could increase the cost to the company anywhere
from $600,000 to $3 million in additional fines.
     The bankruptcy filing could complicate
government efforts to collect the fines.
     Also U.S. District Judge Samuel Wilson has
refused to back off an 18-month prison sentence for
mine superintendent Garry Williams. Williams'
lawyers had asked to delay formal entry of judgment
for 30 days, so they could file a motion for
reconsideration of the sentence.
     Defense lawyers had earlier agreed to a lighter
sentence endorsed by federal prosecutors, but the
federal judge is not bound to adhere by such plea
agreements.
     Wilson had issued the tougher sentence after
reading an MSHA letter regarding unpaid safety
fines from operations Williams had run in the past.
Williams' lawyers still have until June 19 to appeal
the sentence, officials said.
     Wilson stood by his sentence during court
proceedings June 9.

PAYMENTS REQUIRED UNDER NEW FUNDS LAW ARE 'TAXES,'
HAVE BANKRUPTCY PRIORITY

     The recently enacted Coal Industry Retiree Health
Benefit Act, which imposes costs on coal mining
companies in order to stabilize the UMW retiree
health funds, applies to a company in Chapter 11
reorganization proceedings.
     The U.S District Court for the Southern District
of New York rejected LTV Steel Co.'s argument that
the new funds law does not apply to it. The court
also held that required contributions are "taxes"
entitled to first priority under the Bankruptcy Code,
and the obligations imposed by the new law should
be given first priority in LTV's bankruptcy
proceeding (MRR Document No. 0529).
     LTV Steel was a signatory to several industry-
wide wage agreements, which were the product of
multi-employer bargaining by the Bituminous Coal
Operators Assn. with the UMW. LTV filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1986 and sought
to terminate health benefits to retirees.
     In 1991, LTV won a court battle when a federal
appeals court held it was not required to provide
retiree benefits after January 1988 when the 1984
wage agreement expired. However, the new funds
law enacted in late 1992 makes all companies that
once signed any wage agreement with the UMW
liable for perpetually funding the retiree health care
system on a per-head basis. Under the new law,
contributions are paid to the UMW Combined Fund
which in turn provides benefits to retirees.
     LTV is now preparing to emerge from Chapter 11
and has scheduled a confirmation hearing on a plan
that does not provide for payments under the new
funds law, which LTV claims will be at least $12
million annually.
     LTV argued that any claim the Combined Fund
has against it is a "pre-petition claim" and barred
because it was not filed on time. However, the court
ruled the Combined Fund did not have a "claim"
before LTV's bankruptcy petition was filed because
any claim "simply did not exist" until the funds law
was enacted in 1992.
     The court also agreed with the Combined Fund
that contributions required by the new law are
"taxes" imposed by the federal government and,
therefore, are administrative expenses entitled to first
priority under the Bankruptcy Code. "Coal Act
obligations are appropriately described as 'taxes' due
to their overwhelmingly involuntary nature, their
explicitly stated public purpose and their obvious
potential to be imposed pursuant to the taxing
power," the court said.
     The court added that LTV's charges under the
new law are a "direct consequence of its continued
corporate existence," noting the law only imposes
obligations on signatories which are still "in
business," and are therefore best classified as
"administrative expenses."
     LTV and other companies have also attacked the
new funds law on constitutional grounds (MRR 2/12,
p. 56; 4/9, p. 167).

PARTNERSHIP MAY STILL BE LIABLE FOR
INCOAL'S WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY

     A partnership under "common control" with
Incoal Inc. may still be liable for Incoal's $810,610
withdrawal liability to UMW pension plans after a
recent federal appeals court decision.
     The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit ruled the lower court erred in
letting Double A Farms off the hook based on its
finding that there was no economic connection
between the two entities.
     The D.C. Circuit stressed it is not necessary to
find an economic connection in order to establish
that an enterprise is a "trade or business" under
common control with an employer and liable for its
unpaid withdrawal liability (MRR Document No. 0525).
     The court refused to decide the merits of the issue
and sent the case back to the U.S. District Court for
the District of Columbia to rethink its finding that
Double A Farms was not a "trade or business."
     However, the D.C. Circuit said it was inclined to
side with the trustees of the UMW pension plans
who sued Double A Farms to collect Incoal's unpaid
withdrawal liability.

Incoal conceded liability

     Incoal, owned by the Adkins family, went out of
business in 1985 and conceded withdrawal liability
to the pension plans under the Employment
Retirement Income Security Act. The Adkins family
established Double A Farms in 1979 after acquiring
several hundred acres of land in Kentucky, and the
family claimed it bought the land for recreational and
investment purposes.
     Under ERISA, when an employer incurs
withdrawal liability, a "trade or business" under
"common control" is also responsible for paying the
withdrawal liability to the pension plans. The district
court ruled that Double A Farms was not a "trade or
business" under ERISA because there was no
economic connection with Incoal (MRR 2/14/92, p.
62).
     Reversing the lower court on this issue, the D.C.
Circuit said any inquiry into an economic connection
between the two enterprises is "irrelevant" in
determining whether Double A Farms is a "trade or
business" under ERISA.
     The appeals court sent the case back to the district
court to "find the facts" on this issue. However, the
appeals court set forth several guidelines and pointed
to a 1987 U.S. Supreme Court decision interpreting a
similar "trade or business" provision of the Internal
Revenue Code.
     The Supreme Court said the "primary purpose for
engaging in the activity must be for income or profit"
and that there must be "continuity and regularity" of
involvement.
     The D.C. Circuit said these factors appear to be
fulfilled in this case, noting Double A Farms
reported tobacco and cattle sales for at least seven
consecutive years.
     The court added it is not dispositive that the land
is used partly for recreational purposes and warned
the lower court not to base its findings on the
family's "self-serving" statement that they did not
intend to start a trade or business.
     Connors v. Incoal Inc., CA DC, No. 92-7023,

FOURTH CIRCUIT DENIES BENEFITS TO
WIDOWS IN TWO SEPARATE CASES

     In two separate cases, the 4th U.S. Court of
Appeals denied benefits to widows seeking
survivors' benefits under the Black Lung Benefits
Act.
     In a decision issued June 2, the court found that
substantial evidence supported an ALJ's decision that
Bramble Grizzle died from lung cancer and that
pneumoconiosis was not a substantially contributing
cause or factor leading to his death.
     Grizzle worked in coal mines for 35 years before
his retirement and subsequent death in 1983. The
ALJ found that Grizzle had pneumoconiosis to some
degree at the time of his death, that he also suffered
from severe emphysema and heart disease, and that
the direct cause of his death was a pulmonary
hemorrhage caused by lung cancer.
     Grizzle's widow presented the testimony of the
miner's personal physician that black lung disease
weakened his heart and lowered his resistance so that
he could not withstand bleeding caused by his
cancer. Grizzle's physician added that
pneumoconiosis caused the miner's emphysema and
heart problems and may also have caused his lung
cancer.
     However, the ALJ relied on the reports of two
other physicians who stated that the miner was
totally disabled by emphysema caused by cigarette
smoking; that his lung cancer was also caused by
smoking, not by his black lung disease, and that he
had only a mild case of pneumoconiosis.
     The ALJ found that Grizzle's pneumoconiosis
was not a substantially contributing or a
complicating factor in his death under 20 CFR
718.205(c)(2) and he denied his widow's claim.

Widow urged use of 'true doubt rule'

     Appealing to the 4th Circuit, Grizzle's widow
argued that her physician's diagnoses raised at least
some doubt that black lung disease substantially
contributed to her husband's death and that she was
entitled to the benefit of the "true doubt rule."
     However, the court, while affirming the use of the
"true doubt rule" in limited situations, refused to
apply it to the widow's claim, noting the ALJ clearly
found the opinions of the employer's doctors far
more persuasive than the contrary view of Grizzle's
physician.
     The court also rejected her argument that a
treating physician's opinion is entitled to greater
weight than the reports of non-treating doctors.
     One judge dissented, stating the case should be
remanded in light of the recent 4th Circuit decision
in Shuff v. Cedar Coal Co., in which the court held
that pneumoconiosis is a "substantially contributing
cause" of death if it hastened the miner's death in any
way (MRR 7/17/92, p. 337).
     In an unrelated decision issued May 26, the 4th
Circuit ruled that Eula B. Lester failed to show her
husband had suffered from complicated
pneumoconiosis. Under Sect. 921(c)(3) such a
showing entitles a claimant to an irrebuttable
presumption that pneumoconiosis caused death or
disability (MRR Document No. 0521).
     The widow relied on a conforming chest X-ray
reading, but the court noted that all the other medical
evidence, including biopsy and autopsy results,
showed that, at most, her husband suffered from
simple pneumoconiosis.

PYRO FOREMEN HIT WITH $2,000 FINES;
MUST PAY FOR PROBATION SUPERVISION

     Four Pyro foremen received $2,000 fines and
three must pay for their supervision costs for their
role in conditions leading to the methane explosion
that killed 10 miners in September 1989.
     Despite the differing number of counts against
each man, they each paid the same $2,000 fine, and
three paid supervision costs of $1,383. All four also
paid a special assessment.
     An information filed March 10 against three of
the foremen charged them with violating 30 CFR
75.324 and 75.1802 for knowingly and willfully
stating in the preshift, onshift and daily report book
that no hazardous conditions had been observed by
or reported to them, when in fact methane was in
excess of 2% and had caused equipment to
deenergize.
     Chris Johnson, 33, of Nebo, Ky., was sentenced
on June 1 to one year of probation and a special
assessment of $125.
     The information on Johnson said that on five
occasions, March 31, 1989, April 1, 1989, May 11,
1989, June 22, 1989 and Sept. 11, 1989, methane
was reported to and observed by Johnson, in
concentrations at or above 2% in the working
section, and that mining equipment had been de-
energized from the methane.
     Perry Ray, 36, from Clay, Ky., was also
sentenced June 1 and must pay the fine, supervision
costs and a $25 special assessment for not reporting
methane problems. He was a foreman on a
continuous mining unit when methane had been
above 2% and equipment had de-energized on May
12, 1989.
     Eddie Frank Barber, 36, of Earlington, Ky., was
fined and put on probation for one year for not
reporting methane conditions on July 14 and July 22,
1989. Barber had to pay a special assessment of $50.
     These three foremen had to pay $1,383.60 for the
costs of their supervision.
     The fourth foreman, Gary Johnson, 39, of
Mortons Gap, Ky., was sentenced to four months of
home confinement as part of a one-year probation
term. He had to pay a special assessment of $150.
     Gary Johnson was charged in a six-count
information with violating:

     -- 30 CFR 75.324, for failing to report high
        concentrations of methane.
     -- 75.1315(a), for firing shots outside the confines
        of a borehole.
     -- 75.1313(b), for ordering the improper storage
        of explosives.
     -- 75.1310(c), for firing explosives with an
        impermissible blasting unit.
     -- 75.316, for ordering the operation of two
        longwall shearers at the same time in violation of the
        methane and dust control plan.
     -- 75.1101-23(c), for failing to conduct mandatory
        fire drills and reporting in the "Fire Drill Record
        Book" that fire drills had been conducted.

     Johnson was sentenced in accordance with a plea
agreement, in which he agreed to cooperate in the
continuing investigation and related prosecutions
stemming from the explosion.

SCHOOLS IN W.VA. BENEFIT FROM SENTENCE

     A mine operator will pay a $50,000 criminal fine
and provide computers to Mingo County, W.Va.,
schools as part of the sentence stemming from a
blasting accident that injured one miner in 1989.
     The company, Meador Energy, pleaded guilty to
four counts of violating the Mine Act at its No. 1
mine near Newton, W.Va. The company had been
charged with five counts in a criminal information
filed Feb. 3 (MRR 2/12, p. 59).
     The Sept. 8, 1989, blasting accident injured one
miner whose arm was broken in four places. The
company pleaded guilty to using faulty pillar
recovery methods; firing unconfined explosives;
placing primed explosives without deenergizing
nearby electrical equipment; and allowing an
unqualified miner to fire shots.
     The company also gets four years' probation. As
part of the probation, the company volunteered to
provide 25 personal computers to five Mingo County
schools, along with installation and training.
     The company had faced a $1 million fine.

JUDGE THROWS CONTRACTOR INTO JAIL

     Saying coal dust sampling fraud must stop, a
federal judge in Beckley, W.Va., sentenced a
contractor to one year in jail and three years'
probation.
     West Virginia contractor Glen Morgan, who
operated under the name Kanawha Valley
Enterprises and later General Safety Services had
pleaded guilty in March to submitting false dust
samples to MSHA on behalf of operators as recently
as June 1991 (MRR 4/9, p. 168). Morgan also
admitted to providing false certification for required
miner training.
     U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Hallanan also fined
Morgan $5,000. Following his prison term, he cannot
engage in training miners or coal mine dust sampling
for three years.
     Morgan had faced a $250,000 fine and five years
in prison.

COAL VENDOR PLEADS TO RACKETEERING

     Sentencing is scheduled Aug. 31 for a
businessman who has pleaded guilty in connection
with a racketeering scheme which bilked coal
companies of more than $900,000.
     Robert S. Painter, owner/operator of Bluefield,
W.Va.-based Abbs Valley Electric, entered the plea
recently before U.S. District Judge Samuel Wilson in
Abingdon, Va.
     Painter, along with other defendants, are said to
have defrauded several companies of more than
$900,000 over a five year period. Companies burned
in the scheme included Peabody Coal, Eastern
Associated Coal, Island Creek, CONSOL, Canada
Coal and Pittston subsidiary Sea B Mining.
     "The investigation revealed that Painter provided
cash kickbacks, prostitutes, and other items to coal
company employees to induce them to direct their
employers' business to Abbs Valley Electric,"
according to a government statement.
     False billings generated proceeds which were then
used by Painter to pay cash to the coal company
employees. Painter also pleaded guilty to conspiracy
to defraud the government of income taxes, and
illegal dumping of hazardous wastes.
     Also pleading guilty on conspiracy or income tax
charges were Painters' daughter and son-in-law,
Sherri and David Bailey; Abbs Valley salesman
Gerald Tabor; ex-Island Creek purchasing agent
Howard Cook; and Painter's brothers-in-law Richard
Weiner and Albert Harless. Nine defendants were
originally indicted.

ALJ IMPROPERLY AWARDED BACKPAY TO
MINER ON REMAND, FMSHRC RULES

     An ALJ erred in awarding backpay to a miner
when he reconsidered his decision on remand from
the commission, FMSHRC ruled.
     The miner, Ronny Boswell, won his
discrimination complaint filed against National
Cement Co., but ALJ Roy Maurer, in his initial
decision in February 1991, found the miner was not
entitled to backpay. Maurer found that the operator
had illegally disqualified Boswell from his job as a
utility laborer and reassigned him to a position as a
payloader operator based on a series of protected
work refusals.
     The operator appealed the case to the commission
and the panel sent it back to Maurer, asking him to
reconsider whether a particular incident involved
protected activity (MRR 3/13/92, p. 110).
     On remand, Maurer again sustained Boswell's
complaint, but this time he decided the miner was
entitled to a $6,094 award of backpay and interest, in
addition to his prior award of reinstatement (MRR
4/24/92, p. 188).
     The commission agreed with National Cement
that Maurer lacked jurisdiction to reexamine the
issue of Boswell's damages. The miner never
appealed the ALJ's initial ruling that he was not
entitled to backpay and that ruling became a final
commission decision, FMSHRC said.
     The panel also noted that it directed Maurer to
answer two questions on remand relating to the
merits of Boswell's discrimination complaint and
never ordered him to reopen the issue of damages.
FMSHRC vacated his supplemental damages award
and refused to review his other rulings in favor of the
miner.

SIXTH CIRCUIT UPHOLDS ALJ DECISION

     A federal appeals court affirmed an ALJ decision
that a miner was illegally discharged for making
safety complaints.
     In a brief, unpublished decision, the 6th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Kem Coal Co.'s
claim that it discharged Charles T. Smith for
swearing at his supervisor (MRR Document No. 0528).
     The court said that ALJ William Fauver
"correctly pointed out that [the supervisor] provoked
Smith's outburst by flatly denying that he had ever
ordered Smith to work under falling coal."
     The court also found that "Smith's complaint
about the hazards of the falling coal, [his
supervisor's] denial of his order to work under it and
Smith's reaction" by swearing "are inseparable."
     The 6th Circuit added that the company's
affirmative defense fails because the miner's
swearing "cannot reasonably be isolated as an
independent motive for the discharge."
     The commission had denied Kem Coal's petition
for review of Fauver's decision and the company
appealed the decision to the 6th Circuit.

MAY ACCIDENTS CLAIM SEVEN LIVES;
36 HAVE DIED SINCE JANUARY

     Seven miners lost their lives in May mining
accidents, with two deaths in underground mines and
five deaths at surface operations.
     Year-to-date reports show 36 fatalities since
January, with 15 miners dying in metal/nonmetal
accidents and 21 dying in coal accidents. Twenty-
one of the YTD deaths occurred at surface operations
and 15 at underground operations.
     Two miners were killed in machinery accidents in
May.
     David Workman was killed May 10 at the
Murphy No. 1 Preparation Plant of Min, Inc. in
Wharncliffe, W.Va. He had only one month of
experience.
     Workman, who was a general laborer for Fielding
Hydroseeding, was washing a Bowie hydroseeder
when he fell into the augers through an opening on
top of the tank. An access cover on top of the tank
had been removed.
     Roger D. Smith, Jr., a repairman for Limousine
Coal, Inc., was killed May 13 at the No. 3
underground mine in Dayhoit, Ky. He had three
years' experience and had been with the company for
one year.
     Smith was performing maintenance work with a
bolting machine and was positioned across a drill
boom. When his filter SCSR and lamp belt became
entangled in the controls, the boom raised and pinned
him to the roof, crushing him in the chest area. He
died less than two hours later.
     Three miners died in power haulage accidents in
May.
     Bruce E. Schoolcraft was killed May 12. He had
14 years' mining experience.
     Schoolcraft was an underground mine foreman
for Cross Mountain Coal, Inc.'s No. 6 mine in Lake
City, Tenn. He was operating a six-ton battery
locomotive when he became caught between the
mine roof and the frame of the locomotive. He died
instantly from head injuries.
     Bret Hatfield was killed May 3. He was an
apprentice mechanic/welder for Stewart-Nuss, Inc.'s
Blackstone Pit and Mill in Fresno, Ca.
     Hatfield was driving a welding truck when he
collided with a haul truck traveling in the opposite
direction on a pit haul road. Hatfield's truck burst
into flames on impact, and he died instantly. He had
over three years' mining experience.
     Glen Baese died on May 10 when he was crushed
by a screw conveyor. He was a plant foreman for
Carl Schlegel, Inc.'s Clinton County Pit mine in St.
Johns, Mich. He had three years' mining experience.
     Baese and two other employees were
investigating why a sand stacking conveyor had
stopped. While a dewatering screw was still running,
the buildup of sand at the top end of the screw tanks
caused the support structure of the unit to collapse.
The two employees assisting Baese jumped to safety
and escaped uninjured.
     Bill Anderson, a superintendent working at
Hardin County Materials Co.'s Plant No. 2, died on
May 17. Anderson got up on a conveyor belt to
examine spillage from a primary crusher and fell 14
feet to the ground. He had 30 years' of mining
experience.
     Thomas Reaska was killed May 27 at Midwest
Material Co.'s Lacon Plant in Lacon, Ill. He had 13
years' mining experience.
     Reaska, a mechanic at the mine, was dismantling
a crane boom to extend its length for other work.
When he drove an assembly pin out of the boom, the
boom fell on him.
     Reaska's accident was the third fatality involving
a boom this year.

BLAST DEBRIS KILLS CAR PASSENGER

     MSHA and OSM investigators are looking into a
blast at the Sugar Ridge Coal Co. surface mine in
Tennessee that caused small boulders and mud to fall
onto Interstate 75, killing a car passenger.
     The mine had been closed for more than a week
while MSHA tried to interview all the miners. The
accident occurred June 4, a Friday, and MSHA was
at the site that weekend.
     Investigators were supposed to conduct
interviews June 8. But as of June 14, one miner did
not want to be interviewed until his attorney got back
from vacation.
     Killed was Brian Agujar, 16, of Louisiana. He
was travelling with his family on vacation.
     MSHA said the company was blasting 240 feet
from the road, which is the legal distance. However,
blasting must be strictly controlled so debris does not
leave a blast site.

MSHA EXTENDS FINAL RULE STAYS

     Industry has been given a temporary reprieve on
provisions in the controversial explosives and
ventilation final rules.
     MSHA has stayed nine explosives provisions for
metal/nonmetal mines until Dec. 31 and stayed two
ventilation provisions for underground coal mines
until July 1, 1994.
     On the explosives rule, stayed are:

     > 30 CFR 56./57.6000, the definition of a "blast
site," which industry asked MSHA to clarify.
Industry asked MSHA to add language that unloaded
holes are not part of a blast site unless they are
within 30 feet of a loaded hole.
     > 56./57.6130(b) and 56.57.6131(a)(1) for
explosive storage facility provisions which may be in
conflict with other federal regulations.
     >  56./57.6202(a)(1), which would require that
vehicles containing explosives be structurally sound
and well maintained.
     > 56./57.6304(b) on primer protection. Industry
has asked for additional language that rigid
cartridges or bags could be slit and the contents
poured to cover the primer. There was also concern
over how much water should be in a hole when
cartridges are dropped.
     >  56./57.6306 on loading and blasting and what
activities are permitted in the blast site.
     > 56.57./6501(a) on nonelectric initiation
systems.
     > 56./57.6902(b) on the special precautions that
must be taken when blasting sulfide ores.
     > 56./57.6903 on burning explosive material.
Industry worries the current language would be
misconstrued by some who would stay to fight fires
involving explosives.

     On the ventilation regulation, stayed are:

     > 75.313, covering main mine fan stoppages with
persons underground.
     > 75.344(a)(1), which would require electric
compressors to be located in a noncombustible
structure or area.

MSHA DIST. 6 INSPECTORS ACCUSED OF
HARASSING COAL MINE OPERATORS

     MSHA says it is looking into complaints that
MSHA inspectors are harassing operators in Dist. 6
out of Pikeville, Ky.
     According to a letter written by David Gooch,
president of the Kentucky-based trade group Coal
Operators & Associates Inc., Dist. 6 operators have
had "problems with plans, enforcement and threats.
 ... Most of the difficulties seem to be traceable to
Jesse Cole, the District Manager."
     MSHA spokesperson Kathy Snyder said Cole is
an "experienced and highly respected manager with
MSHA," but added that the agency is investigating
Gooch's concerns.
     Gooch said his group has had meetings with Cole
regarding his policies and "taken as many as 40
operators with us at times." He said he even went to
MSHA headquarters in Arlington, Va., to meet with
Cole's superiors.
     Gooch says he is out to get evidence that
operators are being harassed, and he has put his
members on notice that they need to document
problems.
     "We need to be able to prove there is a pattern of
harassment, a pattern of inspectors and supervisory
personnel who have intentionally gone above and
beyond the scope of their authority, a pattern of
inspectors being allowed to do their jobs in an
improper manner," Gooch said.
     Gooch said an "improper manner could be
anything from loafing all day on your job, asking for
something of value, making threats, writing citations
and orders for non-existent violations and other such
improprieties."
     Operators have been told to keep a record of
inspections and write down what the inspectors do
while they are at the mine site. "If he sits in your
office three hours drinking coffee and leaves, write
that down. If he makes a threat or says anything that
is not according to regulations and policy, write that
down."
     But all of the documentation the industry group
wants, Gooch said, will all be kept confidential
because many of the operators "are afraid of
retaliation from MSHA."
     Meanwhile the local American Federation of
Government Employees union warned MSHA
inspectors to "be careful."
     Hugh Smith, the AFGE union president, told
MSHA inspectors in a memo: "It is evident that there
are coal operators trying to gather information
against you that could mean your job. Let's be
careful out there. Write what you find and
document!!!"

EASTERN FILES NLRB CHARGES AGAINST UMW; COURT GRANTS
PEABODY RESTRAINING ORDER

     Eastern Associated Coal Corp. has charged the
UMW with threatening and intimidating the
company's suppliers and vendors, while Peabody
Coal Co. was able to get a court order limiting strike-
related activity.
     The union has been on strike at these mines since
June 2.
     In charges filed with the National Labor Relations
Board, Eastern says UMW actions violate previously
issued NLRB orders from strike-related cases with
other companies.
     Eastern is seeking to halt what it calls strike-
related misconduct at its Federal No. 2 Mine in
Monongalia County, W.Va.
     The company filed four charges against the UMW
international and its affiliated members.
     The company filed two charges against the
international and UMW Local 1570.
     Eastern said the union has conducted "mass
picketing in numbers as high as 40 to 50" at Berry
Trucking of Rivesville, W.Va. Eastern said the
UMW has threatened to use violence against Berry
Trucking owners and threatened to damage Berry's
property.
     Berry Trucking is an independent contractor for
Eastern and "has a preexisting relationship to haul
coal before the strike," according to the filing.
Because of this, the union is actually conducting a
"secondary boycott," which violates Sect. 8(b)(4) of
the National Labor Relations Act, Eastern said.
     Eastern spokesperson Tom Gallager said the
charges were filed against the international and local
because local UMW members were picketing at
Berry's property. Picketing must be authorized by the
international. There was no evidence the district was
involved.
     Two other charges are aimed at the international,
the district and the local.
     In this case, Eastern charges the three union
affiliates with interfering and threatening suppliers
and employees who try to enter or leave the mine.
The union is also charged with trying to damage
vehicles that have attempted to cross the picket line.

Traffic on public roads halted, says Peabody

     In the Peabody case, the Warrick County, Ind.,
Circuit Court granted a temporary restraining order
preventing the UMW from obstructing traffic at the
company's Lynnville No. 1 mine near Lynnville, Ind.
     The court ordered the union to limit the number
of picketers to no more than two at any of the three
intersections where the obstructions have occurred.
     In its filing with the court, Peabody said that
UMW members were walking in "a slow and close-
file line" at the mine entrance and at county road
crossings adjacent to the mine. The union was
refusing requests to let traffic through and forced
drivers to wait up to three hours, according to the
company statement.

PEABODY, CONSOL HIT IN LATEST ROUND
OF UMW SELECTIVE STRIKES

     The UMW has expanded its selective strike to
more than a dozen additional mines for Peabody
Holding Co. and CONSOL in West Virginia, Illinois
and Kentucky.
     The fifth wave of the UMW strike against the
Bituminous Coal Operators' Assn. affects an
additional 3,000 miners and brings the total number
of strikers to 12,000. The job action adds
subcontractors to the list of operations being struck,
and the union said it will strike Peabody
subcontractors.
     "We have targeted the two largest coal producers
and the leadership of those companies, George 'Sam'
Shiflett at Peabody and Bobby Brown at CONSOL,
who are principal spokespeople for the BCOA," said
UMW President Richard Trumka.
     "And you can always tell when a strike is having
an effect when the coal companies become more
frantic in their actions," Trumka said of Peabody's
action against 163 miners in Kentucky.
     CONSOL operations hit in this latest phase
include Burning Star No. 2 in Illinois and Robinson
Run in West Virginia.
     Peabody operations hit include Baldwin mine and
Randolph preparation plant and related surface
facilities in Illinois, and the Martwick mine in
Kentucky.
     Eastern Associated was hit at Tygart River,
Lightfoot No. 1 and Colony Bay mines as well as the
Rocklick plant in West Virginia. "The UMWA-
elected officials are trying to damage Eastern
Associated but in the process, they may be cutting
off future job opportunities for our employees," said
Eastern President Peter Lilly.

PEABODY BACKS OFF FIRING 163 UMW MINERS, INSTEAD
ISSUES FOUR DAY SUSPENSION

     Peabody Coal Co. has backed off its initial plans
to fire 163 union members who allegedly tried to
shout down company President Sam Shiflett.
     Having originally announced it was suspending
the Camp No. 1 employees with intent to fire,
Peabody downgraded the punishment to a four-day
suspension without pay.
     In explaining its decision, the company said the
June 3 episode was probably instigated by union
leaders, but individuals miners must be held
accountable for their own actions. The mine resumed
operation Wednesday June 9 after being idle the
previous Friday, Saturday, Monday and Tuesday.
     "We're glad they have come partially to their
senses," said UMW spokesperson Greg Hawthorne.
The union will still appeal the suspensions because
the miners were exercising "protected" activity, he
said.
     Peabody had announced plans to fire the miners
for insubordination after they refused to give Shiflett
their attention during a company meeting, by
chanting "contract, contract." UMW President
Richard Trumka the Peabody move a "high-handed
tactic befitting a plantation owner."
     But the critique by industry sources wasn't much
kinder.
     One lawyer said Peabody was smart to back off
its original hardline because attempting to sack the
miners would be a "grievous blunder in labor
relations."
     There was no way the firings would have ever
passed muster with the National Labor Relations
Board, the attorney said. It's silly for Peabody to
expect union miners would "sit there and listen to a
propaganda speech" while there's a strike going on.
     Another official expressed fear the UMW could
make potential firings into the type of rallying issue
similar to cancellation of retiree health benefits
during the Pittston strike. The episode also adds fuel
to the UMW argument that it's involved in an unfair
labor practices strike, at least in connection with
Peabody, the source said.

DECERTIFICATION ELECTION UP IN AIR FOR
BUCK CREEK COAL CO. MINERS

     The lawyer for a group of Buck Creek Coal
employees who want out of the UMW has renewed a
request for a decertification election, but the National
Labor Relations Board said no such vote will happen
soon.
     A May 6 decision by a three-member panel of the
NLRB was a mixed verdict for Buck Creek and the
UMW.
     The panel upheld an ALJ ruling that Buck Creek
implemented a flex schedule without first bargaining
with the union -- but also struck down the judge's
decision to add nine months onto the union's
"certification year." That's the time period in which a
union has to reach a labor contract with a newly-
organized operation.
     As a result of the latter development, Jim Hanson,
a lawyer for the "Vote No Committee" at Buck
Creek, has renewed his request that the NLRB
proceed with a decertification election.
     The board has yet to respond to Hanson's letter,
but "at this point it does not look like there's going to
be an election any time soon," said an NLRB
official.
     Before the petition could move forward Buck
Creek must comply with NLRB's May order. Also
current unfair labor practice charges filed by the
NLRB must be cleared up before any decert vote.
The union went on strike against Indiana's biggest
deep mine in April. Although the operation was
organized in late 1991, the two sides have failed to
reach a contract.

VOTE SCHEDULED AT ZEIGLER SUBSIDIARY ON HEELS OF
SUCCESSFUL MARROWBONE VOTE

     With the UMW on an emotional high from its
apparent victory at Marrowbone Development, a
certification vote is set June 28 for another non-
union subsidiary of Zeigler Coal Holding.
     Zeigler's SMC Mining stands behind the decision
of management at Wolf Creek Collieries to
"vigorously oppose" the UMW drive, said company
official Vic Svec.
     Wolf Creek is located just across the Kentucky
line from Marrowbone. The National Labor
Relations Board confirmed that Marrowbone
employees had voted 256-to-151 to join the union.
There were 33 challenged ballots. The company had
not announced by press time if it planned to
challenge the election or the campaign leading up to
it.
     Industry opinions vary on whether Marrowbone
signals a brighter day for UMW or was merely a
flash in the pan.
     An official with a rival coal company subscribes
to the latter theory. The UMW had some "really
stupid management helping them" at Marrowbone,
he said. The source thinks the UMW also has an
excellent chance at Wolf Creek.
     Wolf Creek returned to work in late-May
following a two-and-a-half week walkout sparked by
changes in retiree medical benefits, officials said. It's
hard to say how the Marrowbone vote may affect the
Bituminous Coal Operators' strike. Most officials
think it will hearten the UMW. Others think BCOA's
B.R. Brown could use it as evidence that the UMW
can organize mines without extensive job rights at
non-union operations.
     Marrowbone has filed formal objections to the
way the union conducted its campaign leading up to
the certification vote. The company claims UMW
officials made unlawful threats and promises
throughout the campaign.
     Among the claims in the two-page document is an
allegation that the union said it would add 10 years
eligibility toward the UMW pension after two years
of credited service, as an inducement to vote pro-
union. "By such conduct, petitioner unlawfully
interfered with employees in their exercise of free
choice in the election."

BCOA FILES SUIT TO STOP AMAX WITHDRAWAL; AMAX SAYS IT
WILL BARGAIN WITH CYPRUS

     The Bituminous Coal Operators' Assn. has filed a
lawsuit against AMAX Coal Co. to prevent AMAX
from exiting the multi-employer bargaining group.
     AMAX announced last week, following a
decision to merge with Cyprus Minerals Co. of
Englewood, Colo., that it would withdraw from the
BCOA. Cyprus bargains independently of the
BCOA, and its current contract does not expire until
July 1.
     "If I were on BCOA I'd be furious and I'd file
suit," said an industry source the day before the suit
was filed.
     BCOA has accused the union of "inducing" AMAX to
withdraw from BCOA in the midst of contract talks to
enable the nation's third-largest coal producer to
negotiate its own agreement. BCOA said the law is
clear, and that once negotiations begin, companies in
a multi-employer group must be bound by the contract
negotiated by that group. They cannot cut their own
deals.
     AMAX said last week it is withdrawing from the
group because it will be governed by the labor
agreement that its merger partner, Cyprus Minerals,
is negotiating with the UMW. Cyprus is talking with
the union about its Emerald and Cumberland mines
in Pennsylvania and the Kanawha mine in West
Virginia.
     But the provision that limits AMAX's or any
other company's right to leave BCOA is a murky
area of labor law. Defections are acceptable under
"unusual circumstances" -- a term that has never
been explicitly defined by the courts. Some think the
Cyprus-AMAX consolidation constitutes such
circumstances.
     One industry source finds the AMAX defection
from BCOA more puzzling now than if it had come
before the merger announcement. AMAX's presence
would have given the Cyprus-AMAX hybrid insight
into BCOA bargaining. The source also described
AMAX as a "fairly soft" member of BCOA -- while
Cyprus Minerals has not been reluctant to lock horns
with unions in the past.
     The same industry official thinks it does the union
little good to knock off contract deals one-by-one.
The union doesn't appear to have the ability to
conduct more than one set of major talks at once, the
source said. Furthermore, the UMW is still not going
to make any real gains without eventually going
through Peabody and CONSOL, the source said.

continuous miner, longwall face equipment and
loading machine. The monitor must degenerize the
equipment when it is not working properly or when
methane reaches 2%. It must sound alarm when
methane reaches 1%.
     The company proposed to use a hand-held
continuous-duty methane and oxygen monitor on
permissible three-wheel tractors with drag bottom
buckets (MRR 11/20/92 p. 566) [Docket No. M-92-
131-C].
     Hearing requests are due June 27.
Face Ventilation Control Devices Variances Denied
       Turris Coal Co. of Elkhart, Ill. was denied a
variance for 30 CFR 75.330 to its Elkhart Mine in
Logan County, Ill.
     The code requires face ventilation control devices
to be made on flame resistant material approved by
MSHA and to protect against harmful gases, dusts,
smoke and fumes. The devices must be installed no
later than 10 feet from the area of deepest penetration
that the face has advanced unless an alteration
distance is specified and approved.
     The company had proposed to modify a minimum
of 9,000 cfm of intake air in the line of crosscuts to
augured and a minimum of 5,000 cfm of intake air
passing across the auger machine while auguring.
The company would continuously monitor the air
from the company face through a 3/4-inch pipe MRR
1/29/93 p. 38 [Docket No. M-92-189-C].
     Comments are due July 1.

Construction of Seals Variance Requests

     K and L Coal Co. of Shamokin, Pa. wants to
modify 30 CFR 75.335 to its No. 1 Slope in
Northumberland County, Pa.
     The code requires that each seal constructed after
August 15, 1992 shall be constructed of solid
concrete blocks at least six inches by eight inches,
laid in a transverse pattern with mortar between all
joints.
     The company proposes to construct an
overlapping one-inch hardwood board to a minimum
of two inches thick and coat with a flame retardant
coating as a seal for its anthracite coal mine, to make
a daily visual inspections of the stopping, and to take
air measurements before and after a series of
stoppings [Docket No. M-93-75].
     Hearing requests are due July 12.
 Air Courses and Belt Haulage Entry Variance
Requests
     Genwal Coal Co. of Huntington, Utah wants to
modify 30 CFR 75.350 to its Crandall Canyon Mine
in Emery County, Utah.
     The company proposes to use the belt air to
ventilate the face and to install a low-level carbon
monoxide detection system in all belt entries used as
intake air courses as an early warning fire detection
system [Docket No. M-93-68-C].
     Hearing requests are due July 12.

Automatic Emergency Parking Brake Variances Granted

     CH and S Coal Co. of Birchleaf, Va. was granted
a variance for 30 CFR 75.523-3 to its No. 3 Mine on
Scott County, Va.
     The code requires that except for personnel
carriers, rubber-tired, self-propelled electric haulage
equipment used in the active workings of
underground coal mines shall be equipped with
automatic emergency-parking brakes.
     The company proposed to operate S&S 482
scoops without emergency brakes because of the
slope of the mine and coal bed undulation (MRR
12/4/92 p. 597) [Docket No. M-92-149-C].
     Hearing requests are due July 8.

Preshift Examination Variance Requests

     Costain Coal Inc. wants to modify 30 CFR 75.360
(b) to its Baker Mine in Webster County, Ky.
     The code requires that the person conducting the
preshift examination shall examine for hazardous
conditions, test for methane and oxygen deficiency,
and determine if the air is moving in its proper
direction, at the following locations.
     Due to the deteriorated conditions and roof falls
in the intake entry in the 2nd Submain East
immediately adjacent to the room necks, travel in
this entry would be unsafe. The company proposes to
establish two continuous monitoring stations with
both audible and visual alarm signals to monitor the
air passing through the affected area [Docket No. M-
93-66-C].
     Hearing requests are due July 12.

Methane Examination Variances Denied

     Turris Coal Co. of Elkhart, Ill. was denied a
variance for 30 CFR 75.362 (d) to its Elkhart Mine in
Logan County, Ill.
     The code requires a qualified person to test for
methane, at 20-minute intervals, before equipment is
energized, taken into, or operated in a working place.
The tests must be made at the last permanent roof
supports, unless the ventilation plan requires them to
be made closer to the working face.
     The company proposed to have a qualified person
test before an auger machine is deenergized and to
use the machine's continuous methane detection
sensor to test air before auguring begins. The
company would have continued testing at intervals of
20 minutes (MRR 1/29/93 p. 40) [Docket No. M-92-
188-C].
     Hearing requests are due July 1.

IRREBUTABLE PRESUMPTION PROVISION OF
KY. LAW CONSTRUED BY STATE COURT

     The Kentucky Court of Appeals held that a miner
must show exposure to coal dust caused his disability
in order to be entitled to the irrebutable presumption
of total disability set forth in KRS 342.732(1)(c).
     The miner argued he submitted the required X-ray
evidence and met the necessary spirometric test
values to trigger the statute's irrebutable
presumption. However, the court read into the statute
the requirement that a claimant must also prove that
he contracted pneumoconiosis from work-related
exposure to coal dust (MRR Document No. 0527).
     The court remanded the case and ordered the ALJ
to determine whether the claimant's disability was
caused by his cigarette smoking or exposure to coal
dust. If his disability was caused by both factors, he
is still entitled to an award of benefits if coal dust
exposure was a "medically significant cause of the
respiratory impairment," the court said.
     The court read the necessary causation
requirement into the statute, finding the legislature
left it out as an "oversight."
     The court reversed an ALJ's award of total
permanent disability benefits that was affirmed by
the Workers' Compensation Board.
     Four judges dissented, stating that KRS
342.732(1)(c) is "clear upon its face" and should be
read "precisely as written." Under the statute, an
irrebutable presumption of total disability resulting
from exposure to coal dust is triggered if the required
X-ray evidence and respiratory impairment test
results are submitted, the dissenting judges said,
finding "nothing absurd or unreasonable in this
result."

ALABAMA COURT UPHOLDS BENEFITS AWARD TO MINER WHO
EARNED MORE AFTER INJURY

     A miner who returned to his same position and
earned more money after he injured his arm may still
keep his award of workers' compensation benefits
based on a finding of 31% loss of earning capacity,
an Alabama Appeals court ruled.
     The Alabama Court of Civil Appeals said that
when a worker's post-injury earnings equal or exceed
his earnings at the time of the injury, there is a
presumption of earning capacity commensurate with
earnings.
     However, the miner rebutted this presumption by
introducing independent evidence that his post-injury
earnings were an unreliable basis for estimating his
earning capacity, the court said (MRR Document No. 0519).
     The miner showed his post-injury increase in
earnings resulted primarily from collective
bargaining salary increases; his working hours
increased since his 1986 accident; and he received
assistance from co-workers, the court noted. A
vocational rehabilitation expert also testified that the
miner had lost access to a "significant number of
jobs" because of his injury.

Judges' Decisions

(will become final in 40 days unless ordered
reviewed)
     MSHA v. ADAMS STONE CORP., 6/9/93. Civil
penalty proceedings: A judge ordered a small
Kentucky limestone operator to pay $3,425 in
penalties for six violations of Part 56 standards,
discovered during an MSHA investigation of a
serious accident at the quarry (MRR Document No. 0534).
     An MSHA inspector issued six Sect. 104(d)(1)
citations and orders after investigating the accident in
which the assistant quarry superintendent fell 30 feet
from the top of a primary crusher and suffered
permanently disabling injuries.
     The judge found that the operator committed an
S&S violation of 30 CFR 56.15005 because
unrebutted evidence established that the assistant
superintendent was not wearing a safety belt or line
when he fell. He agreed with MSHA that the
operator was guilty of "unwarrantable failure"
because the assistant superintendent was an agent of
mine management and knew his actions were unsafe.
He fined the company $1,600 for the violation.
     MSHA cited the operator for a second S&S
violation of 30 CFR 56.15005 after the inspector
observed two miners working on top of the crusher
without wearing safety belts or lines the day
following the accident. The judge agreed the
violation was S&S and also caused by the operator's
unwarrantable failure, finding that mine management
had an obligation to ensure that miners who
continued to work on the crusher after the accident
wore safety belts and lines to prevent another serious
accident. He fined the operator $1,000.
     The judge ruled the operator also violated 30 CFR
56.18009 because the inspector found six miners
dismantling the primary crusher for repair without a
"competent person" in charge as required by the
standard. He ruled the violation was S&S, but not the
result of unwarrantable failure because one member
of the crew, the crane operator, was an experienced
and trained employee who could take over in the
event of an emergency. He assessed a $225 civil
penalty.
     The judge also assessed penalties totaling $600
for three violations of explosives standards. He held
that the company violated 30 CFR 56.6313, because
two large limestone boulders had been drilled and
charged with explosives and left unattended and
unbarricaded for one week; 30 CFR 56.6320,
because the operator exceeded the 72-hour time limit
between charge and blast times; and 30 CFR
56.6305, because unused explosive materials were
not moved to a protected area within a reasonable
time after the boulders were charged.
     The operator argued that three separate citations
were not justified because they concerned a single
condition. However, the judge found the cited
standards impose separate and distinct duties on the
operator and he ruled the three citations were not
duplicative. He said the violations of 30 CFR
56.6313 and 56.6305 were S&S, citing the hazards of
a premature detonation. However, he said MSHA
failed to prove that the operator was aware that the
boulders had been drill and charged, and he ruled the
violations were not the result of its unwarrantable
failure (Koutras, Judge; Nos. KENT 92-604-M and
92-770-M).

     JERRY IKE HARLESS TOWING INC. v.
MSHA, 6/2/93. Contest proceeding: A company that
dredges sand from a riverbed is an operator under the
Mine Act and must file a legal identity report with
MSHA as required by 30 CFR 56.1000, a judge ruled
(MRR Document No. 0515).
     The judge ruled the company violated 30 CFR
56.1000 and ordered it to filed the required report
within 21 days.
     He rejected as "frivolous" the company's
arguments that sand is not a mineral and that it
extracted sand in liquid form. The judge noted that
MSHA routinely oversees sand and gravel dredging
operations and said the company's extraction and
preparation of sand through its filtering process are
clearly activities covered by Sect. 3(h)(1) of the
Mine Act.
     However, the found that another corporation
owned by the same individual that stores and sells
the sand is not subject to the Mine Act (Feldman,
Judge; No. CENT 92-276-RM).
     MSHA v. MULLINS AND SONS COAL CO.,
6/3/93. Civil penalty proceeding: A judge agreed
with a coal company that its conceded S&S
violations of coal dust standards 30 CFR 75.400 and
75.402 were not the result of its "unwarrantable
failure" (MRR Document No. 0535).
     An MSHA inspector cited the operator after he
discovered loose coal, coal dust and float dust
accumulations ranging from three to six inches deep
for a distance of 180 feet. He described the
accumulations as black and found no evidence of
significant rock dust content.
     The inspector based his unwarrantable failure
charge on the fact that the accumulations were noted
in the pre-shift examiner's book. However, the judge
found that the notation acknowledging the
accumulations was a mitigating factor in assessing
the degree of the company's negligence.
     The judge also noted that the accumulations had
existed for only three hours and that the operator's
scoop was out of service and being charged.
     While not guilty of unwarrantable failure, the
judge found the operator was moderately negligent
and assessed a total of $1,000 in penalties (Feldman,
Judge; No. KENT 92-669).

     MSHA v. QUARTO MINING CO., 6/7/93. Civil
penalty proceeding: A judge fined a coal mine
operator $800 for an S&S violation of 30 CFR
77.1606(c) because of a defective steering wheel on
a front-end loader (MRR Document No. 0533).
     The inspector discovered the malfunction when
he asked the equipment operator to demonstrate the
steering on an idling Caterpillar 988 front-end loader
in the mine's supply yard. When the steering wheel
was turned to the right, it locked in position, forcing
the equipment operator to use both hands to break
the lock. Then the wheel would spin very fast,
causing a potential loss of control of the vehicle, the
judge found.
     The equipment operator told the inspector the
condition was intermittent and that he had reported
the malfunction to the shop foreman, who was
unable to correct the problem.
     The judge found that the malfunctioning steering
was an obvious safety defect. He ruled the violation
was S&S because it presented a hazard to the
equipment operator, to pedestrians and to other
vehicle drivers. He also found the operator guilty of
"unwarrantable failure" because the shop foreman
knew of the defect for several months and failed to
correct the defect or remove the loader from service
(Fauver, Judge; No. LAKE 92-309).

BONDS FROM TENNESSEE INTERIM
PROGRAM MUST BE FORFEITED TO OSM

     An insurance company must forfeit two
reclamation bonds to the federal government, even
though the bonds were issued when the government
did not require bonding, a federal court ruled.
     U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Tennessee upheld an IBLA ruling that the bonds were
"statutory bonds," and OSM became the
successor-in-interest to the bonds when it took over
Tennessee's program (MRR Document No. 0517). Exchange
Insurance Co. had challenged the IBLA decision
ordering the company to forfeit two bonds worth
$81,000.
     Tennessee had enacted its program in 1980, only
to kill it on Oct. 1, 1984. Exchange issued two
performance bonds for two mining permits filed
during the state's interim program. The bonds were
issued when a bond was required by state law, but
not by federal law.
     When the federal government was taking over the
state's program, it announced in the Federal Register
that it would not assume responsibility over interim
program bonds. In addition, the state's attorney
general said that bonds in which no forfeiture
proceedings had started before Oct. 1, 1984, were
voided by the legislative repeal of the Tennessee
program.
     But the attorney general also noted that the
federal government succeeded to any permanent
program bonds in which forfeiture proceedings had
not yet started.
     Although the bonds were originally issued under
the interim rule, they were used to support second
permits under the final rule. It was this point when
the bonds became "statutory bonds."
     Exchange tried to argue that when the federal
government took over the program it required
permittees to change the payee of the bonds to
include the federal government as "co-payee" within
30 days of the effective date of the new program.
     Exchange never complied with this order, but it
was also never challenged by the government for not
complying. Exchange said that this is evidence that
the government did not consider the original bonds
payable to it.
     But because the bonds had been transferred to
second permits, with Exchange's consent, to support
permanent program permits, this made them
statutory bonds, and OSM the successor in interest.

ANDALEX TRUCK ROUTE TOO DANGEROUS
BECAUSE OF SCHOOL, RESIDENTS SAY

     Residents are up in arms over Andalex's plan to
run double-trailer coal trucks through their town
which is 100 miles away from the coal-rich Kaiparowits
area in southern Utah.
     Nearly 200 residents of Hurrican, Utah, which
lies on the state route that would be used to reach
rail loadout points, turned out for a protest meeting
last week.
     Townspeople say the 45-ton trucks would wear
out the roads, cause air and noise pollution and add
to the congestion already a problem with traffic
heading to and from Zion National Park.
     But they were particularly upset about the safety
of children at the school, which is at bottom of a
steep two-mile long 8% grade hill on the truck route.
They say the grade increases the danger of a runaway
truck.
     Their concern was backed up by the Southern
Utah Wilderness Alliance (SUWA) who used
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety statistics
showing double-trailer trucks are two to three times
more likely to have an accident than single-trailer
trucks.
     The alliance has been fighting development of
coal-rich Kaiparowits for decades.
     A representative of a trucking firm working with
Andalex said the latest trucks are better able to
negotiate the steep inclines because they have more
braking power per ton than those built a few years
ago.
     The noisy protest meeting early this month added
to the controversy surrounding Andalex's plan to
mine 400 million tons of coal from Smoky Hollow
which lies between two wilderness areas and next to
a national recreation area.
     Andalex wants to use the trucks to get the coal to
rail lines in Utah and Nevada.

CALIFORNIA DESERT MUST BE PROTECTED FROM MINING,
EXPLOITATION, SAYS BABBITT

     Land exchanges will be used to preserve areas of
the Southeast California desert if legislation makes it
through the House and Senate.
     Desert protection legislation would create 74
wilderness areas and upgrade Joshua Tree National
Monument and Death Valley National Monument to
national park status.
    The House version would make the East Mojave
Desert a national monument and the Senate version
would make it a national park. The Senate version is
the most restrictive of the two, which the
administration prefers, Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt told the House subcommittee on national
parks June 15.
     Most of the land owned by the government, more
than 7 million acres, would be designated as
"wilderness," closing the land to mining. If the land
is designated a "national park," then mining may be
permitted.
     Babbitt noted that in the California desert, "You
can still see roads cut through sand by Conestoga
wagons," and "scars mark the mines that delivered
fortunes to claim settlers who would not be turned
away."
     The interior secretary said the desert is threatened
by "those who would pillage its subtle beauty."

Many forms need protection, says Babbitt

     Babbitt agrees with environmental groups that
legislation is needed to protect sand dunes, extinct
volcanos, archaeological sites and rare plant and
animal life, and that protection is needed from
mining and grazing.
        Babbitt also stressed that the entire "ecosystem"
needed protection, and not protecting one area would
harm an entire region.
     Additions proposed for the Joshua Tree National
Park would include the Coxcombe Mountains, Pinto
Basin and Pinto Mountains, Little San Bernardino
Mountains and the Eagle Mountains.
     "Resource protection would be greatly enhanced
here with the full ecosystem included under one
management entity," Babbitt said.
     But Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., sees taxpayers
ending up with a huge bill to acquire the land or
giving up valuable federal lands in land exchanges.

Company, schools own large parcels

     One of the debates centered around land owned
by the Catellus Corp.
     Babbitt supports land exchanges for the Catellus
land and California school lands, which are the two
entities that own the vast majority of non-federal
land in the area.
    Lewis said that 355,000 acres owned by Catellus
are worth between $750 and $1,500 an acre.
     But Babbitt called these figures "absurd," and said
the department would work out exchanges providing
Catellus with federal land that had similar
characteristics to the Catellus land that would be part
of the protected area.
     There is another area of the desert, however, that
poses a different problem.
     The Lanfair Valley area contains about 1,000
small, individually owned private parcels. Babbitt's
concern is that these will be developed once the park
is established.
     Babbitt said the government must think of an
"innovative approach" to deal with the private land
holdings or purchase the properties through
condemnation.
     Although Babbitt did not directly say that he
supports "zoning" the area, he did say that he
supports a "comprehensive land use plan for the
valley to promote park purposes while affording
private landholders the maximum flexibility to
continue traditional and appropriate uses of their
land."

COURT CONSIDERS AMAX PERMIT

     With AMAX having mined out its Skyline Glady
Fork reserves, resolving the environmental concerns
delaying a new permit at the Tennessee operation has
taken on a new urgency.
     While lawyers for AMAX and OSM argue the
merits of the company's toxic materials handling
plan in a Knoxville courtroom, Skyline employees
are shipping from coal stockpiles to the Tennessee
Valley Authority's Widow's Creek.
     "Basically, we've finished mining, we're mined
out," said AMAX spokesperson Kevin Feeney.
Skyline finished work on the Glady Fork section in
mid-May. The company has enough stockpiled coal
to satisfy the customer for several weeks, Feeney
said.
     Interior Dept. ALJ David Torbett is considering
Skyline's permit request to commence mining on the
Big Brush section now that Glady Fork is mined out.
Earlier this year AMAX was successful in getting a
federal court order which reversed an OSM decision
that stopped mining at Glady Fork (MRR 2/12, p.
70).

OSM, MONTANA HOLD ENFORCEMENT MEETING;  MERIDIAN
SUSPENDS WORK UNTIL SEPTEMBER

     Montana regulators and OSM plan an informal
conference June 30 in Billings to discuss the state's
enforcement of SMCRA.
     Earlier this month Northern Plains Resource
Council asked OSM to take over that portion of the
Montana Dept. of State Lands program, which
oversees Meridian Minerals' plans for a major new
longwall operation (MRR 6/4, p. 285).
     OSM Acting Director Hord Tipton found merit in
the environmental group's concerns and instructed
the state to suspend the Bull Mountains No. 1 permit
because Montana was not effectively enforcing the
law.
     Meridian has "voluntarily entered into a cessation
of operations" until Sept. 1, said Bonnie Lovelace,
who oversees coal and uranium reclamation for the
Montana program. The company wants to commence
road construction at the coal complex prior to
Montana's snowfall season -- which hits high gear in
November, officials said.
     Meanwhile "we'll be making our points" at the
conference. The state will try to convince OSM that
Tipton's concerns have been addressed. It will also
question the legality of OSM potentially suspending
primacy in one regard to an individual permit.
     Montana officials say any shortcomings on
Meridan's Bull Mountains Mine enforcement, such
as failure to file certain public notices, hardly justify
potential suspension of primacy. State officials also
say the Resource Council has been involved in every
step of the permit process at Bull Mountains.
     OSM representatives have said their goal isn't
revoking Montana's primacy but merely ensuring
SMCRA is enforced properly.

EPA PROPOSES OFF-ROAD EQUIPMENT RULE FOR ENGINES
BIGGER THAN 50 HORSEPOWER

     It's finally come to this: a rule so big the
government can't or won't publish it in the Federal
Register.
     Twelve hundred pages of an EPA nonroad engine
regulation proposal, including uncondensable graphs
and diagrams, are available on computer disk. EPA
was kind enough, however, to publish the proposed
rule's 36-page preamble.
     According to the preamble, nonroad equipment
with engines more than 50 horsepower, including
construction, logging and mining machines, would
be regulated for nitrogen oxides (NOX) and smoke
emissions.
     Engines that would be excluded from regulation
include those that are regulated by MSHA for
underground use.
     Under authority of the 1990 Clean Air Act, which
by the way was just 313 pages long, EPA began
studying emissions from nonroad engines and
vehicles and determined that the equipment kept at
least one area of the U.S. from meeting national
ambient air quality standards for ozone and carbon
monoxide.
     A critical part of the problem, the agency said, is
the formation of ozone in and downwind of big
cities. EPA said these emissions can also cause areas
outside big cities to fall below federal standards.
     But the American Mining Congress disagrees
with EPA. Mines are located mostly in remote,
undeveloped areas and do not cause those regions to
fall below the federal ambient area standards, an
AMC source said.
     While the optimal engine cutoff size has not been
determined, engine manufacturers and other industry
sources have suggested a cutoff in the range of 450
to 750 horsepower -- a far cry from the 50-
horsepower minimum under the EPA proposal.
     Engines used to propel vehicles or power
equipment, such as mobile cranes, or those used as
auxiliary engines, such as for refrigerated trailers,
would be regulated as well.

Emission credit program proposed

     EPA has proposed an averaging, banking and
trading program for large nonroad compression-
ignition engines in the hopes of providing
manufacturers "flexibility in meeting the proposed
NOX standard without reducing environmental
benefits."
     The program would allow manufacturers to earn
emission "credits" and bank them for future
averaging or trading. The credits could then be
applied to engines that are difficult to standardize.
     Engines in California would be excluded from the
credit program because the state requires that all
engines sold there meet the NOX standard.
     If manufacturers use the program, changes in
equipment design would be minimal, according to
EPA. There would be no effects on 50- to 100-
horsepower equipment, while flexibility would be
allowed for those engines requiring substantial
changes.
     Given that all manufacturers participate in the
emission credit program, the average annual cost to
develop and make engines meeting NOX and smoke
emissions standards would be $29 million.
     EPA assumes that manufacturers will pass any
increased costs of regulation to the consumer by
raising the prices of their engines. EPA's estimated
average price increase for 1996 is $110 per engine.
     AMC says the mining industry disputes this
figure and believes that the real cost per engine could
be much higher.
     EPA's Selective Enforcement Auditing program
would require nonroad engine manufacturers to test
newly assembled engines for emissions compliance.
This section of the proposed rule was designed to
establish an annually limited number of audits for
each manufacturer.
     EPA will hold a hearing on the proposed
regulation in Ann Arbor, Mich., on June 25. Written
comments to EPA are due July 27.
     To obtain a copy of the proposal or to order the
computer disks contact: EPA, Air Docket, Mail Code
LE-131,  401 M St. S.W., Room M-1500,
Washington, D.C. 20460, or call 202-260-7548.

ASARCO NAMED PRP AT TRIUMPH

     ASARCO Inc., the Idaho Dept. of Lands and
Triumph Minerals Inc. have been named as the
potentially responsible parties at the Triumph Mine
Tailings Piles site, which was recently proposed for
Superfund listing.
     EPA is continuing a search for PRPs and is
planning an expedited protective action to prevent
continued exposure to residents.
     A risk assessment identified arsenic as the
primary contaminant of concern. Several areas,
including tailings piles, a mine process foundation
area and several residential yards, pose acute and
chronic exposure risks from arsenic levels.
     Preliminary bioavailablity study results show
arsenic is more readily absorbed than lead. The study
was done by feeding dirt from the site to pigs.
     EPA is evaluating results of the risk assessment to
identify the arsenic concentration that should be used
as the action level for expedited response.

Discovery

     UNITED STATES V. MIKE POLESCHOOK
AND PETER POLESCHOOK, 4/12/93, CACA
29892. OHA declared a placer mining claim void
because of lack of valuable discovery of gold,
despite the placer holder's willingness to expend
more time and effort to locate valuable mineral
deposits.
     The government brought the case before OHA on
the basis of a finding of an inspector from the U.S.
Forest Service that the Bend Ten placer mining claim
in Butte County, Calif., cannot be mined at profit.
This finding was made on the basis of the value of
the gold so far extracted and despite the fact that
Poleschook testified that he believed the gold could
be found in a deep hole on the site.
     OHA noted Poleschook had not mined in that
hole and that the hole is in accessible. This means it
would not be possible to mine it in a manner that
would be economical according to the standards of
"the prudent person." Further, the appeals panel
found, "Mr. Poleschook's willingness to expend his
labor and means is not in itself enough to meet the
prudent person test."
     U.S. V. JOHN R. PICHOWICZ, 5/12/93, A MC
303306-303313. OHA ruled eight mining claims to
be null and void for failure to discover valuable
mineral deposits, after rejecting the contestee's claim
that the government should have gone beyond the
mining work done by the contestee to identify more
valuable samples.
     OHA found BLM presented a solid prima facie
case that valuable gold deposits had not been
identified. BLM's mineral report and cost analysis
showed John Pichowicz would have to expend
$3.59/cubic yard to mine the claims, which were
located within Arizona's Muggins Mining District.
That fact was not rebutted by Pichowicz. OHA said,
though, the analysis might have underestimated the
cost to mine the claims because reclamation,
operating dry concentrations and other issues were
not taken into account.
     OHA felt BLM also overestimated the value of
the gold by failing to account for a 5-15% loss in
gold recoverability that would result from the dry
placer methods Pichowicz proposed to use. The
highest gold value BLM identified was $2.44/cubic
year. So, using the best sample, it would be expected
Pichowicz would lose $1.15/cubic yard of material
mined, OHA said.
     The contestee did not offer any substantial
evidence of discovery, but instead criticized BLM's
sampling methods for failing to reach the bedrock.
But, OHA held, "a government mineral examiner has
no obligation to explore or sample beyond the
mining claimant's workings or to perform sufficient
work to reach a definite conclusion as to whether a
valuable mineral deposit does or does not exist"
within the claim. "If a valuable mineral deposit
exists, it is incumbent upon the claimant to discover
it" at the time of the hearing, OHA held.
     OHA also rejected Pichowicz's request for
compensation for the fair market value of his claims.
"The federal government may withdraw its land from
mineral entry regardless of any right a prospector
may have to exclude others from the claim under the
doctrine of pedis possessio," OHA held.

Jurisdication

     CONSOLIDATED COAL CO. V. OSM, CH 91- 9-R,
4/12/93. OHA rejected a challenge to a NOV because the
challenge should have been brought not before the
hearings division but in a U.S. district court.
     OSM issued a NOV charging that Consolidated
Coal Co. failed to: regrade, protect and stabilize all
areas disturbed by coal mining; control discharge to
stop erosion; establish sediment control for a
haulroad; establish a permanent vegetative cover on
a disturbed area; and compact material used to
backfill and maintain drainage for the northeastern
portion of the permit area.
     Consolidated did not dispute the facts. Rather, it
claimed that OSM did not have the power to issue
the NOV because SMCRA does not authorize OSM
to issue such NOVs in states with approved
regulatory programs, such as Pennsylvania, unless
there is a finding of widespread enforcement
deficiencies within that program and no such finding
has been made, Consolidated argued.
     The ALJ said however, that Consolidated's
challenge must fail because it is well settled that a
challenge to SMCRA regulations must be brought in
the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
Circuit within 60 days of promulgation of the
regulations (30 U.S.C. Sect. 1276(a)(1)(1982)). "The
District of Columbia circuit has exclusive
jurisdiction over such challenges," the judge said.

Placer Mining

     U.S. V. JAMES UBERT, RITA AUBERT,
RENEE AUBERT AND JASON OTEN, 4/12/93,
CA MC 244967-244968. OHA ruled a placer mining
operation should not be allowed when it was found
to be unprofitable, while at the same time it would
reduce the income from recreational use of a river
within the permit area.
     BLM's California office transmitted to the
Hearings Division a dispute involving the Mote A-B
and Mote C placer mining claims, which were
located in a power site withdrawal on the
Mokelumne River.
     Despite adequate notice the contestees (the claim
holders) did not appear at the hearing.
     At issue was the question whether the mining
operations would substantially interfere with other
uses of the lands covered by the claim. A BLM
geologist testified that the mining operations would
disturb nearly a mile of the Mokelumne River,
interfering with recreational uses of the river. Also,
an official with the East Bay Municipal Utility
District said siltation generated by eight suction
dredges to be used in the operation could impact the
storage capacity of the downstream Pardee
Reservoir.
     The OHA administrative law judge looked at the
revenues over five years from recreational activities
-- $2,000,000 -- that would be substantially reduced
by the mining activity. He compared that with the 20
people who would be employed by the mining
activity and the $100,000 loss the gold mining
operation would suffer over five years. Based on this
comparison, OHA found "placer mining would
substantially interfere with other land uses and that
placer mining should be prohibited" in the areas in
question.

Reclamation

     GATLIFF COAL CO. V. OSM, 5/11/93, NX 92-
6-R.     OHA sustained a NOV after ruling that
OSM's prima facia case that permit violations had
occurred was not refuted by a claim that actions
taken in violation of a permit were just as effective
as the original requirements in reclaiming the land.
     OHA faced review of a NOV for drainage
problems on a permit. OSM cited Gatliff Coal Co.
for:

     > "Failure to construct and maintain Basin 703 in
       accordance with approved plans.
     > Failure to construct [diversion ditch] No. 18 in
       accordance with approved plans."

     An OSM inspector said that Basin 703, which
was depicted in the permit as a permanent
impoundment, had been mined through. The
inspector further found that the diversion ditch
drained into Basin 704, instead of Basin 703 as the
permit required.
     The NOV required reconstruction of Basin 703
and a change in drainage from the diversion ditch.
Gatliff completed the first remedial measures and
filed for review of the NOV.
     OHA noted that in reviewing the NOV, the
burden of establishing a prima facia case would be
OSM's, while the ultimate burden of persuasion
would rest with the challenger.
     OSM "clearly carried its burden of proof," the
OHA administrative law judge held, because it
provided unrefuted evidence two aspects of the
permit were violated. Gatliff did not provide
evidence rebutting that prima facie case and
"attempted to show only that the structures it had in
place were just as effective as those which should
have been constructed." Since the rebuttal failed, the
NOV was sustained.

UNUSED FORFEITED BOND COULD BE RETURNED IF SITE IS
MINED BY ANOTHER OPERATOR

     Kentucky has submitted proposed amendments to
OSM on bond forfeitures and general provisions for
inspection and enforcement.
     Under bond forfeiture, the permittee and\or
operator, not just the operator as it stands now,
would be liable for the additional cost necessary to
achieve reclamation if the amount of the forfeited
bond is insufficient to pay the full cost of the
reclamation.
     It would also require that an unused forfeited
bond be returned to its owner if the state has not
completed the reclamation plan on the forfeited site
and the site is completely over-lapped by another
permit and completely disturbed by that over-lapping
permittee.
     Under inspections, the federal section of the rule
states that regular monthly partial inspections need
not be continued at minesites that are in temporary
cessation, although quarterly complete inspections
must continue.
     However Kentucky program rules do not provide
for a reduced inspection frequency at minesites in
temporary cessation. If approved, the new
amendment will provide reduced frequency of
inspections at such minesites.
     Copies of this file are available at the Lexington
Field Office, OSM, 2675 Regency Road, Lexington,
Ky. 40503-2922.
     Hearing requests are due June 28.

CIVIL PENALTY MODIFICATION APPROVED

     OSM has given Ohio final approval on civil
penalty language.
     The rule allows the Ohio Reclamation Board to
forward penalties or remaining penalty balances to
the Dept. of Natural Resources for deposit in the coal
mining reclamation fund.
     Other amendments had called for revisions to 13
sections of the Ohio Revised Code which concerns
the retention of State civil penalties; refund of permit
fees, confidential information regarding exemption
requests for incidental coal extraction; and both the
Reclamation Supplemental Forfeiture Fund and the
Coal Mining Performance Bond Fund.
     It also concerns the limitations on award of costs
and expenses, reclamation contracts with surface
mine operators, reclamation of interim forfeited
areas, and many others.
     However, these statutory provisions are to be
incorporated into a state bill, which had not yet been
drafted. OSM will make a decision on the language
once the legislation is introduced and a copy of the
bill sent to OSM.
     Information on the language can be obtained from
the Columbus Field Office, OSM, 2242 S. Hamilton
Rd., Room 202, Columbus, Ohio 43232.

AMENDMENTS FACE COURT CHALLENGE

     The Pennsylvania Coal Assn. is challenging
OSM-approved provisions of the state's surface
mining program that go by the adage "ignorance is
no excuse."
     An OSM-approved amendment allows the state to
assess individual civil penalties against corporate
officers who do not knowingly and willfully
participate in a violation.
     Changes also approved by OSM override
Pennsylvania's "dual opportunity" appeal process.
The state has eliminated an operator's right to appeal
a violation when a civil penalty is appealed.
     Stephen Allen of Buchanan Ingersoll said this
provision is directly contrary to a 1988 court
decision, Kent Coal Mining Co., which upheld an
operator's right to appeal both a violation and an
excessive penalty.
     The association has asked the court to
permanently enjoin the state and OSM from
enforcement of both provisions and is asking for
attorney fees.

BONDING LANGUAGE PROPOSED

     OSM has received two proposed amendments
from Pennsylvania regarding self-bonding and
financial instruments permitted for posting
performance bonds.
     The new amendment would provide the permit
applicant with the option to use a self-bond as the
financial tool instead of a surety or collateral bond
for the performance bond. Performance bond's are
must be presented before a coal mine permit may be
issued or coal mining activities can begin.
     The state also wants to amend what is accepted as
a financial instrument for a performance bond.
     The state would like to add the options of life
insurance policies, annuities or trust funds as
acceptable financial instruments for posting
performance bonds.
     Comments are due by July 7, hearing requests

TESTS CONFIRM SAGA HAS MAJOR GAS FIND IN 6406/2

Saga Petroleum, operator of last year's most significant Norwegian
discovery - 6406/2-1, southwest of Smoerbukk - is believed to be taking
a more sober view of likely recoverable reserves after an extensive
test programme confirmed reservoir variability.  According to the NPD,
a seven-DST test programme proved that reservoir quality varies greatly
over the thick gross pay section with some zones very dense while
others exhibit good production qualities.

Nevertheless, preliminary estimates confirm the find to be of major
importance containing recoverable reserves in the order of 50-100 MMcm
of oil equivalents, reports the NPD.  Informed sources suggest this
range is too conservative and 100 MMcm may be a more realistic
estimate.  Most of the reserves are in the form of gas, but large
quantities of condensate are also present.  The results of the well
currently being drilled into the southern part of the structure -
6406/2-2 - will allow the find's size to be estimated with more
certainty, according to the NPD.

The test programme is said to have yielded maximum gas flowrates of
27.534 MMcfd and 1,572 b/d of condensate through a 28.58-millimetre
choke.  It is believed the water contact proved to be higher than first
thought and the Tilje formation was a disappointment.  As expected
before testing the Ile proved to be the best zone and contains the
majority of the reserves.

Exploration well 6406/2-1 first discovered gas last Spring, but was
suspended short of TD in March due to fisheries and environmental
restrictions (NSL 1000/13).  The well was re-entered late in August
with the semisub Ross Isle and deepened to a TD of 5,766 metres, making
it the deepest exploration well ever drilled on the Norwegian Shelf.
More core material was recovered than on any other Norwegian well -
over 600 metres.  The well was finally suspended on January 7 and the
Ross Isle is preparing to spud Smoerbukk prospect appraisal well
6506/11-4S for Statoil.

AKER, ABB AND MARITIME TENTECH WIN MAJOR AASGARD SHIP CONTRACT

A consortium comprising Aker, ABB and Maritime Tentech has won the
prestigious contract to build the world's largest monohull production
vessel for Statoil's Aasgard oilfield development.  The contractors
will form an alliance with Statoil to implement the project, sharing
profits above a target price for the facilities as well as the risk of
cost overruns.  Maritime Tentech has been given responsibility for
delivering the hull, which will be built by Hitachi in Japan.  This
contract is valued at Kr 1.52bn ($239m).  Aker Engineering and ABB will
have responsibility for engineering and purchase of the plant to be
installed on the deck of the vessel, a contract which amounts to around
Kr 140m.  Aker Stord will assemble and hook-up the vessel - work valued
at Kr 300m.

The contracts with ABB, Aker and Tentech, which are subject to
government approval of the field development plan, include options of
around Kr 450m for further fabrication and marine installation.  The
vessel's deck plant, due to be purchased this Spring, is not included
in the contracts awarded to date.

The oil production vessel for Aasgard is due for delivery from Stord at
end-May 1998 for first oil in August 1998.  The ship will have a
production capacity of around 200,000 b/d of oil and gas processing
capability of up to 16 MMcmd.  Storage will be provided for 150,000 cm
of oil.  The vessel will measure 276 metres long by 45.4 metres across
the beam with a draught of 26.6 metres.

Aker also announced the Kr 380m contract for electrical work on the
Aasgard Field had been awarded to Aker Elektro.  The company will
supply systems for the production vessel and the gas platform with the
contract encompassing engineering, follow-up work at the shipyards,
hook-up, testing and commissioning plus an option for operating
maintenance and the supply of spare parts during the operational phase.
 Preparatory work will begin at once and the project is planned to
start in March 1996.  The gas platform is due for completion in October
2000.  Aker Engineering and Cegelec UK will be Aker Elektro's main
subcontractors.

At the same time Aker said Statoil had awarded Aker Engineering a Kr
30m contract to design the production systems for the Aasgard Field gas
platform.  Design work will get under way immediately and continue
until April 1997.  The scope of Aker Engineering's contract may be
expanded, depending on how the project is implemented.  A decision on
whether detailed engineering and construction will be separate
contracts will be made later this year.  If they are, Aker will carry
out detailed engineering.

ESSO CONTRACTS ABB FOR SUBSEA PART OF BALDER

Esso Norway has awarded an ABB/Coflexip Stena partnership a Kr 650-700m
($102.3-110.2m) contract to design, procure and install all the subsea
equipment for the Balder Field development.  ABB will be responsible
for the wellhead equipment and controls, while Coflexip Stena will be
responsible for the risers and flowlines.  The contract was signed just
before Christmas and engineering work has already started.  The initial
phase of the work, comprising 15 wells, is to be completed by 1998,
with equipment for the first well to be delivered by October this year.
 There is an option for a second phase involving an additional 10-12
wells.

*  Amerada Hess is thought to be close to a contract award for the
subsea part of Durward/Dauntless, with Stolt Comex Seaway believed to
be well placed.

TEXACO ISSUES NOTICE FOR PIPELINE SYSTEM WORK

Texaco, London, has advertised a requirement for the detailed
engineering, procurement, installation, testing and pre-commissioning
of oil and gas pipeline systems in the UK Central North Sea.  The entry
is thought to refer to the proposed Galley development in block 15/23.
The pipelines are expected to be between six inches and 12 inches in
diameter and are required for the export of processed oil and processed
or unprocessed gas.  The water depth is up to 150 metres.  Pipeline
length will be between seven kms and 30 kms. The workscope may include
the design and installation of spool connections, SSIVs and platform
riser installation.

Pipelay and pre-commissioning of tie-ins is to be completed by the
third quarter of 1997.  The pipeline will link a new installation to an
existing host platform.  Replies are due back by January 18 and ITTs
are expected to be dispatched in February.

MANNESMANN WINS CONTRACT TO SUPPLY BRITANNIA LINEPIPE

Britannia Operator has awarded Mannesmann Handel a contract for the
supply of 185 kms of 27-inch OD linepipe for the export trunkline from
the platform to Mobil's SAGE terminal.  A total of 50,000-55,000 tonnes
will be supplied by Mannesmann's Europipe mill in Mulheim, Germany.
First deliveries to a North Sea coating site will be made in June and
should be completed in mid-August.  The pipe coating contract is due
for award in April.  A pipelay contract was awarded to EMC last Autumn.

BOL said that careful timing of procurement and more functional
specifications had saved several million pounds on the contract.  The
choice of an outer diameter of 27 inches on its own had saved some #2m
($3.1m) compared with opting for the larger standard 28-inch diameter
linepipe.

BARMAC PLANS MAJOR INVESTMENT IN NIGG TO MEET CONSTRUCTION NEEDS

Barmac is planning a multi-million investment programme to upgrade
facilities at its Nigg yard in the north of Scotland.  The initiative
forms part of the company's strategic plan to address the needs of the
changing offshore construction market, which has seen the decline of
traditional fabrication markets due to depressed oil and gas prices,
new technologies and the maturity of the North Sea.  At the same time
this is being offset by a growing requirement for floating production
systems, decommissioning of redundant offshore structures, production
jack-ups, concrete structures and other dry-docking work.  The new
business could become equal in size to the old within the next five
years, it says.

The Ardersier yard will continue to concentrate on servicing the
reduced requirement for traditional structures, while Nigg and its
graving dock will form the focus for the new business areas.  "Although
the traditional market is in decline, we believe it will stabilise at
around 10m manhours a year to the year 2000.  With this volume of work
available and the continuous improvement in competitiveness we can win
enough work to sustain a viable and profitable business concentrated in
the Ardersier facility," says Barmac.

Up to #8m ($12.4m) is being targeted for modifications to the existing
graving dock at Nigg and for the creation of a custom-built
decommissioning facility.  It is expected that the funding will come
from Barmac's parent companies and the public sector.  Barmac aims to
obtain planning permission and a waste disposal licence for the Nigg
site, with a capital investment of around #0.5m envisaged to establish
a custom-built facility capable of the containment and collection of
waste materials for subsequent treatment and disposal.

Other opportunities for business in an upgraded dock include building
large production jack-ups similar to that used by BP for the Harding
Field.  Possible collaboration with civil contractors to build offshore
concrete structures is also being investigated, as are the
possibilities of drydocking large semi-submersible and jack-up rigs for
inspection and modification.  "This potential major infrastructure
investment is a clear indication of the confidence our parent companies
have in our ability to win a significant share of growing new markets,
of our employees' ability to adapt in order to capitalise on these
markets and of our determination to build a sustainable future for the
yards," says Barmac general manager Don Wright.

PHILLIPS TARGETS POSSIBLE JACQUI START-UP AT END-1997

Phillips' Jacqui prospect, in UK block 30/13, could be on stream by the
end of 1997 if reserves are firmed up by two back-to-back appraisal
wells to be drilled by the Galaxy 1, according to quadrant 30
development director Pat Dinan, in a house paper.  The drilling of the
second well is contingent on what is found with the first.  Of the two
wells drilled so far on Jacqui, one indicated a gas condensate
reservoir, while the other produced gas, he said.  A high pressure/high
temperature exploration well is being drilled by the Monitor on the
Jade prospect in block 30/2C.  If it is successful, two appraisal wells
will be drilled on Jade in 1997, with first production planned for late
in 1998.

Trafalgar John Brown and Kvaerner Engineering have recently completed
some conceptual engineering studies for Phillips to help identify the
best way of developing some of the remaining quadrant 30 prospects,
confirming Phillips' view that they would benefit from a shared
development plan.  Added impetus is given by the fact that the
Judy/Joanne processing and transport system is now in place.

STATOIL ENGINEERS SEEK PATENTS FOR VESSEL AND LIFTING SOLUTIONS

Patents are being sought by Brian Stead and Ove Gudmestad of Statoil
for vessel and lifting solutions which are claimed to offer cheaper
removal and transport of topsides and jackets to land.  For the largest
platforms a U-shaped main hull is proposed with a smaller removable
hull inside.  For topsides weighing less than 1,500 tonnes a
submersible barge or ship with eight-metre steel shafts, plus a shear
leg, is proposed.  Stead, in a recent house paper, says dayrates for a
barge/ship and a shear leg would be only 10-15% of the daily cost of
the large semi-submersibles.  For jacket and subsea template removal
the suggestion is a supply vessel with winches or wire jacks attached
to its sides.

BHP ACHIEVES FIRST GAS FROM LIVERPOOL BAY HAMILTON NORTH FIELD

BHP Petroleum achieved first gas from the Liverpool Bay Hamilton North
Field on December 20.  The initial output is being used to commission
systems and pipelines offshore and onshore and subsequently PowerGen's
new power station at Connah's Quay before full contract deliveries
begin in mid-1996 (NSL  1033/5).  Oil from Douglas and Lennox is
expected to flow in the next few weeks marking the start-up of first
oil production off Britain's west coast.  Gas production from the
Hamilton Field is scheduled for early this year and from Lennox in
several years' time.  Recoverable gas reserves from the development are
estimated at 1.2 Tcf.  Peak gas capacity of the offshore development
and Point of Ayr terminal is currently 300 MMcfd.

AMERADA AND DONG ASSESS POTENTIAL OF NEW DANISH GAS SYSTEM

Amerada Hess and DONG have agreed to investigate jointly the technical
and economic feasibility of building a new natural gas transport system
in the Danish sector of the North Sea.  Depending on which technical
solution is the most attractive, the system could require an investment
of some DKr 1.5-2.5bn ($269-449m).  A new transport system would be
able to gather gas from Amerada's South Arne Field, on which a
promising production test was run last year, as well as other smaller
fields and could also be linked to the Norwegian system.  There may be
a further possibility to transport gas to Denmark from the UK, German
and Norwegian sectors.

The existing Danish system has an annual transport capacity of about
7.5 Bcm of gas, which corresponds to the total amount of gas which DUC
(until now DONG's sole supplier) is able to deliver to DONG from 1997.
With these deliveries the existing system will be nearing its capacity.
 From the turn of the century, DONG expects to be able to sell
additional gas in the region of 2 Bcm a year.

STUDY SHOWS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF AASGARD GAS WILL BE LIMITED

The environmental impact of processing gas from the Aasgard Field will
be limited regardless of whether it takes place at Kaarstoe, north of
Stavanger, or Kollsnes, near Bergen.  This is the conclusion of the
impact assessment submitted by Statoil and Saga Petroleum to the
energy/industry ministry in December.  The study covered expanding
existing gas processing facilities at the two sites as well as exports
and onshore pipelines.  Aasgard gas is relatively high in carbon
dioxide and because Kaarstoe has limited opportunities for diluting
this content by mixing in other export gas, the carbon dioxide may have
to be removed after 2005.  This does not pose a problem at Kollsnes,
which would be able to add Troll gas low in carbon dioxide before
onward transmission to Continental Europe.

The possible cost of a new fractionating plant at Kollsnes is put at Kr
4.3bn ($677m), including the landfall.  Taking the gas to Kaarstoe
would cost Kr 3bn, involving new construction and modifications to
existing facilities.

IEA FORECASTS NEW PEAK FOR NORTH SEA OIL PRODUCTION

North Sea oil output is set to reach new heights by the end of the
decade, according to the International Energy Agency.  In a new
forecast, the Paris-based agency says production will peak in 1999 at
the earliest, at around 7m b/d, or some 1.6m b/d higher than last
year's level.  Just under half of this - 3.2m b/d - will come from the
UK sector and the rest from Norway, with small amounts from minor
producers such as Denmark and the Netherlands.  The IEA believes this
year's increase will amount to 740,000 b/d, "split almost equally
between the two sectors".

The agency says the common view has long been that North Sea production
would reach its peak in the mid-1990s and fall away quite sharply after
that.  But the new peak "is substantially higher and later than recent
conventional wisdom would have suggested, with consequent repercussions
for the medium-term oil market".  The IEA also expects that the
subsequent decline will be more gentle than forecast as more large
fields are brought on stream and smaller satellite fields are developed
alongside existing ones.

The IEA says earlier estimates suggested the decline rate for the North
Sea would be more than three times as large as that now predicted.  It
attributes the surge in North Sea oil production to improvements in
recovery technology, a highly skilled local workforce and heightened
fiscal incentives for offshore oil companies.  The growing role of gas
also enables more mixed oil and gasfields to be developed.

The study also shows that original reserve estimates have tended to be
too conservative.  Technology-induced cost reductions have enabled
companies to re-classify as economically recoverable oil that was once
considered to be uneconomic to produce.  The agency notes that of the
400 oil and gas prospects identified in the UK sector during the past
30 years, only 143 had been brought into production by the end of 1994.

NIGG TERMINAL CARRIES OUT FIRST TRANSFER OF ALBA CRUDE

The first Alba ship-to-ship crude oil transfer to use the Nigg terminal
in northeast Scotland took place last December, Chevron reports.  Using
a berth at the terminal, 510,000 barrels were transferred from the
shuttle tanker Tove Knudsen to the 97,000-tonne Vesta for onward
shipment to a Chevron refinery in the Gulf of Mexico.  Previously, Alba
cargoes destined for buyers outside Europe were transhipped through the
Norwegian port of Mongstad.  But with new Norwegian fields coming on
stream the Alba asset team had to look elsewhere for a transhipment
facility.  Alba's current average production of 86,000 b/d requires
offloading from the FSU to the shuttle tanker every seven days.

*  A further #0.5m has been shaved from Britannia drilling costs
following the elimination of the entire 133/8-inch casing string from
well M4, drilled by the Sovereign Explorer at the subsea centre
location.  The drilling programme, which also involves the Sedco 711,
is already 11% ahead of schedule.

CHEVRON WINS APPROVAL TO SWITCH FROM UNST TO SCATSTA

The Shetland Islands Council has agreed to Chevron's proposal to use
the airfield at Scatsta for transfers of flights between Aberdeen and
Northern North Sea oilfields.  As a result, from April 1 this year the
company together with joint venture partners Unocal and Oryx will cease
using Unst.  Chevron procurement and logistics services manager Brian
Mountain said the decision had been based on economic factors.  The SIC
also granted outline planning permission for a hangar for two
helicopters which will be erected after flights begin.  The contracts
for airline services on the new route have yet to be awarded.  The use
of Scatsta allows the joint venture to be expanded by the inclusion of
BP, which further enhances the economics of the new routing.

CONOCO UPS MURDOCH RESERVES ON BACK OF NEW WELL

Conoco has increased its estimate of gas reserves in the Murdoch Field
from a 1994 figure of 222.5 Bcf to 351 Bcf following results from a new
production well and better-than-expected reservoir performance.  Well
D6 was drilled in an area initially thought to be unpromising after an
early discovery well performed poorly and the area had been avoided
when the field's five original producers were drilled.  However,
analysis of the geology and the results of a major 3D seismic survey
suggested the initial well had intersected a badly-faulted area,
missing the high permeability sweet spots in the reservoir.

D6 was drilled horizontally and has become the best performing well in
the field, and possibly even the best producing Carboniferous well in
the Southern North Sea, says Conoco in a house paper.  With a
horizontal section of 1,635 ft, it is also the longest horizontal well
drilled in the formation, it adds.  Existing production wells have also
performed better than expected and it is estimated they will ultimately
recover more than 90% of the gas to which they are connected.

Murdoch's field life is also likely to be extended by a number of years
following the installation of a compression platform this year and
commercial agreements with other operators to use the facilities as a
hub for developments in the area.  Agreements are being finalised for
Murdoch facilities to handle production from Shell's Schooner Field and
there are several other potential tie-in prospects in the area, none of
which would be economic on a stand-alone basis.  Further 3D seismic
will shortly be evaluated and three more exploration wells are likely
to be drilled over this year, with perhaps two more in 1997.

*  The decision to pipe excess associated gas in MacCulloch rather than
flaring it put the cost of development above Conoco's #6 ($9.3) a
barrel development target, the company says.  However, during the
design and construction phase the project will be fine-tuned to reduce
costs to meet the #6 target.

JOHN SHAW BACK IN MARKET AFTER SHELL DEFERS KINGFISHER START

The Sonat Offshore semi-submersible John Shaw is back in the market
from November 1996 as a result of Shell deferring plans to develop the
Kingfisher Field in the UK sector.  Drilling of an initial six
development wells was scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of 1996
and a provisional letter of intent had been issued to Sonat for the
John Shaw subject to the project go-ahead (NSL 1037/10).  It is
understood that Shell deferred the project after the failure to find a
satisfactory export solution and concerns over prevailing low gas
prices.  No details are known of any revised schedule for the
development.  The John Shaw is currently on contract with Amerada Hess
in the UK until the end of October 1996.

Shell still has potential requirements for semi-submersibles for Curlew
Field drilling from the fourth quarter of 1996 and a possible
exploration programme starting in the second half of the year.  The
John Shaw together with the Sedco 711 are likely to be a candidates for
both these programmes should they be progressed by Shell.

TOTAL TAKING SOVEREIGN EXPLORER FOR UK AND EIRE DEEPWATER PROGRAMME

Total Oil Marine is finalising the fixture of the Sedco Forex semi
Sovereign Explorer for a five-well deepwater drilling programme in the
UK and Eire starting around August 1996.  The contract is expected to
last around a year and includes three deepwater wells in the UK sector
west of Shetland plus a well in the Porcupine Trough west of Eire.  The
programme is also understood to include a high pressure well in the
northern UK sector of the North Sea.  It is possible that one of the
west of Shetland slots could be assigned to another operator and it is
understood that Conoco could be one prospect.

The Sovereign Explorer is currently drilling development wells for
Chevron on the Britannia Field together with the Sedco 711.  Based on
current progress both rigs are expected to complete the Britannia work
in the third quarter of 1996.

Elf has issued tender invitations for two heavy-duty jack-up
requirements for Phase II development drilling on its Elgin/Franklin
project starting in 1997 and 1998.  Water depth at the central UK
sector location is 92 metres and the programme involves drilling of
deep high pressure, high temperature wells lasting about six months
apiece.  Rig 1 is planned to start in mid-1997 and Rig 2 in mid-1998.
Both units are being offered a firm contract of 30 months plus four,
one-well options plus a further six, one-month completion options.  The
closing date for the submission of bids is February 19.

Elf has already fixed the jack-up Galaxy I for Phase I development
drilling starting in October 1996.  The Santa Fe unit has been
contracted for a firm period of 18 months but this could be extended to
six years.  It appears that, depending on the approach adopted, one of
the Phase II requirements could be against the extension of the Galaxy
I.  However, it is also possible that Elf could opt to use three rigs
on the project by drilling simultaneously on Elgin with two jack-ups.

Availability of suitable existing rigs for Elf's requirement is fairly
limited.  Another Santa Fe jack-up, the Magellan, should be free in the
third quarter of 1997, while the Rowan Gorilla II and Rowan Gorilla IV
are both currently available in North America and Trinidad from the
third quarter of 1996.  The Rowan newbuilding Rowan Gorilla V is due
for delivery in 1998.

The Maersk Guardian is expected to complete the firm phase of its
current contract with Amoco Norway in March 1998, while the Maersk
Gallant is firm with Phillips Petroleum Norway until October 1997.
However, both rigs have extension options outstanding.  A number of
contractors are planning to offer newbuilding units to Elf, but these
would only be an option for the mid-1998 programme given the lead times
involved.

BP RENEWS BENREOCH FOR A FURTHER 12 MONTHS TO MAY 1997

BP has negotiated a new fixture of the semi Benreoch for 12 months from
May 1996.  The rig was bought recently from Ben Line by Stena Offshore,
which has negotiated the new deal with BP.  The Benreoch is currently
on contract with BP until April.  It has completed a one-well
assignment to Texaco and is waiting on weather to return to BP to drill
well 9/9C-16, which is expected to last about 90 days.  The rig is then
due to undergo inspection and survey before beginning the new BP
contract.

BP still has gaps in its drilling sequence with the Benreoch but is
examining the requirements of its internal asset groups before making
any firm moves to assign slots externally.  However, it is understood
that both Conoco and Shell could be interested in taking sublets of the
rig in 1996 should the opportunity arise.  In addition to the Benreoch
fixture, BP still has a requirement for a semi to drill an HPHT well in
central UK sector block 22/25 spudding around September 1996.

*  BP has confirmed a one-well extension of the jack-up F G McClintock
retaining the rig in the southern UK sector until May 1996.  Thereafter
BP's plans are not yet firm, but it is thought likely the operator will
retain the Neddrill 7 through the year while releasing the McClintock.

BP TENDERS FOR WELL AND EXTENDED TEST ON ROSS

BP has tendered for the provision of a semi-submersible, well test
spread, flowlines and tanker to drill a 90-day well on the Ross Field
and undertake a 30-day extended well test.  The programme is scheduled
to start around June 1996.  The closing date for bids is January 15.
The extended test programme will be the final stage in the evaluation
of the field before proceeding in 1997 with a floating production
development.

BP is currently carrying out an early production programme on the
Machar Field with the TAPS group and the Sedco 707.  TAPS is also
slated to carry out an extended test programme on the Clair Field from
April 1996 using the Sedco Explorer.

ROWAN SECURES DUTCH FIXTURES FOR JACK-UP RIGS

Rowan Drilling has secured fixtures for two of its jack-ups in the
Netherlands.  The Cecil Provine has been contracted by Elf Petroland to
drill two wells starting early in March plus an option for a third
well.  The Rowan California has been fixed by Wintershall, also for a
two-well programme, but starting at the end of January and with options
for up to three additional wells.  The firm wells are in blocks K/10
and L/8 and are expected to last a total of 160 days.

Both jack-ups are currently in the UK but their transfer to Holland is
indicative of increasing demand in the Dutch market taking up the slack
in the UK being created partly by concerns about the gas price.  The
Rowan California is currently stacked off Great Yarmouth after being
released by Phillips Petroleum.  The Cecil Provine is drilling its
final well for Amoco after the operator chose not to exercise its last
one-well option.

Elf Petroland in turn has chosen not to exercise its final one-well
option with the jack-up Ensco 85, which it will now release early in
March.  The rig will then enter the yard a modification programme,
expected to last 10-20 days, prior to beginning a one-year contract
with NAM.

MAERSK OIL CHECKS MARKET AGAINST EXPIRY OF DANISH JACK-UP CONTRACTS

Maersk Oil & Gas has circulated a check of jack-up drilling rig
availability for potential one to three-year contracts beginning during
1996.  It is interested in rigs able to drill year-round in the Danish
sector in up to 200 ft of water.  The firm contracts of all four jack-
ups working for Maersk Oil in Denmark are due to expire during 1996.
The Shelf Explorer contract runs out in April but still has two, one-
year options available.  The Maersk Endeavour has a one-year option
left to run from June, while the Neddrill 10 has two, one-year options
from October and the Maersk Exerter a one-year option from November.

*  Conoco is still seeking partner approval to drill a wildcat in its
remaining Dutch sector acreage, probably now spudding in the second
quarter.

BHP ISSUES INQUIRY FOR UK JACK-UP PROGRAMMES

BHP Petroleum has issued a market inquiry for two UK sector jack-up
requirements.  It is interested in rig availability for one well in
Irish Sea block 110/13 spudding in April 1996 and for a four to six-
month programme in the Southern North Sea starting in June 1996.
Replies including indicative dayrates are requested by January 12.

BHP's rig options for the Irish Sea well appear to be limited.  The
Glomar Adriatic XI is already committed for much of 1996 and is
pencilled in for BHP in the fourth quarter of the year.  There appears
to be little prospect of a slot opening up for BHP in the second
quarter.  BHP already has the Trident XIV on contract through 1996 on
Liverpool Bay development work and there are currently no other jack-
ups in the Irish Sea.

A number of jack-ups are due to come available in the North Sea
including the Maersk Enhancer in February/March and the F G McClintock
in May.  However, contractors may be unlikely to make a competitive
offer to mobilise a rig from the North Sea for just one well unless it
can be pegged back-to-back with BHP's Southern North Sea programme.

NORSK HYDRO REMAINS OPEN FOR EXPLORATION SEMI FOR 1997

Although it has not made any formal moves in the market, Norsk Hydro is
looking for a semi for general exploration work in Norway in 1997 for a
period of up to one year.  The programme is not yet firmed up and
ultimately the duration of the contract is also likely to depend to
some extent on the rig selected.  With Norwegian rig availability very
tight, Hydro is keeping a close watch on the market and is maintaining
ongoing discussions with contractors to enable it to make a quick
decision when the right rig becomes available at the right price.

Norsk Hydro is also part of a consortium with Statoil and Saga awaiting
for the announcement of Norwegian 15th round licence awards before
proceeding with the fixture of a rig for a shared deepwater drilling
programme on the Voering Plateau starting end-1996 or early in 1997.

*  Amerada, Conoco, Deminex, Mobil and Shell continue to discuss the
prospects for sharing the term fixture of a semi-submersible to drill
one or two wells apiece in the Norwegian sector from around the second
quarter of 1996.  Rigs which could be available include the Byford
Dolphin or at a later date the Nanhai VI, which is in China.  However,
it remains to be seen whether rates sought by contractors to cover the
cost of the significant upgrading required for Norway will be within
the limits set by the likes of Conoco and Shell which have already
abandoned one tender round late last year as rates bid were considered
to be too high.  While examining the options for rig sharing, all five
operators also remain open to sublet opportunities on an individual
basis.

WEST ALPHA EN ROUTE FROM CHINA TO NORTH SEA

The semi West Alpha has left China and is en route to Singapore to pick
up a wet tow back to the North Sea.  The journey is scheduled to last
about 90 days.  The rig is committed to Esso Norge for a two-year
development drilling programme on the Balder Field starting in mid-
April.  Ahead of the West Alpha, the Byford Dolphin is due in the UK or
Norway between January 17 and 27 subject to weather after mobilising
from the Far East.  Dolphin is due to receive bids from seven yards for
upgrading work including installation of additional columns and a
derrick extension.  The rig is planned to be available in the North Sea
from March 1996.  The Transocean Seeker is due in the North Sea at the
beginning of February at the end of its journey from the Far East.  It
too is still available and is expected to enter the market in April.

Elsewhere in the market, the Ocean Alliance is due out of the Cromarty
Firth at the weekend to return to work for BP, while the Sedco 704 is
due in the Firth for survey work before resuming operations for Shell
on the Gannet Field as a drilling tender.

Northwest European jack-up drilling rig utilisation dipped slightly at
the end of 1995 with the release of the Rowan California by Phillips
Petroleum in the UK and the entry of the Ensco 70 to the Verolme yard
in Holland for upgrading.  The Ensco jack-up is due to return to work
for NAM at the end of February equipped with a new 15,000 psi BOP stack
among other improvements.  The California is stacked off Great Yarmouth
until the end of January when it is due to mobilise for Wintershall in
Holland.

SIRI DISCOVERY COULD BE FAST-TRACKED FOR 1998 START

Siri-1 is a "substantial" discovery, which "appears commercial" and
could be on stream by 1998, according to operator Statoil Denmark.  The
find, which late last year tested at rates of 5,988 b/d of oil (NSL
1037/20), is estimated by the operator to contain 150m barrels of
recoverable oil.  The discovery well is understood to have intercepted
a thick section of sands in a well defined but are really limited
structure.  Reservoir permeability is reported as very good.   The find
has been made in Palaeocene sandstones, outside the Central Graben
area, generating considerable excitement in the Danish Energy Ministry.
 Most Danish fields produce from chalk.

Statoil is already looking at a floating production project for Siri.
Svein Larsen, head of operations in Denmark, said:  "We will be
establishing a core team soon to get Siri quickly on stream and our
ambition is to begin production by 1998."  At the moment the favoured
concept for the field, which lies in around 60 metres of water, is an
FPSO.  This Spring Statoil will shoot 3D seismic and is planning an
appraisal in the Autumn.

The semisub Deepsea Bergen abandoned Siri-1 on December 24 and is now
back with Statoil in the Norwegian sector, where it spudded exploration
well 25/10-6S on December 26.  The  well was abandoned because the hole
was too small in dimensions for production purposes.

AMOCO ABANDONS NOEKKEN DUSTER

Amoco is in the process of abandoning Noekken prospect exploration well
2/8-15 as a dry hole, the NPD confirmed this week.  The semisub Vildkat
Explorer has been delayed by weather but is due off location later this
week when it will head to exploration well 34/11-2S for Statoil.  Well
2/8-15 was drilled to a TD of 3,725 metres and completed in rocks of
Upper Cretaceous age, said the NPD.  There was no test.

HYDRO PREPARES TO RUN ONE TEST ON OSEBERG AREA DISCOVERY

Norsk Hydro is preparing to run a single test on exploration well 30/8-
1Sre, having reached a TVD of 4,767 metres with the semisub Treasure
Saga.  The well encountered gas in Brent formations before being
deepened to examine the Statfjord beneath (NSL 1031/9).  Given that the
Brent shows were described as a significant discovery, it is likely
this horizon is being tested, which could imply the Statfjord proved
barren.  The operator would not confirm the interval which it was
intending to test.

Meanwhile, on the western side of block 30/8, Hydro has abandoned
wildcat 30/8-2 with the semisub West Vanguard, having drilled down to a
TD of 2,405 metres.  The well is untested and understood to be a
disappointment.  The West Vanguard was earlier this week waiting on
weather to get off location.  It goes next to the Oseberg Field for
development drilling duties.

VESLEFRIKK WILDCAT TURNS UP SMALL FIND

An exploration well drilled from the Veslefrikk platform to examine a
separate structure to the west, has turned up a small find, according
to the NPD.  Well 30/3-7S encountered hydrocarbons in Mid-Jurassic
sandstones before being suspended (NSL 1036/12).  The NPD said the find
was probably small, but a planned production test will establish the
type of hydrocarbons present and reservoir characteristics.  Positive
test results would lead to the well being tied back to the Veslefrikk
platform for production.  The well was drilled to a TVD of 3,994
metres.

DRILLING ACTIVITY UPDATE, NEW SPUDS AND COMPLETIONS

In the UK sector Amerada has spudded Fife development well 31/26A-A7
with the semisub High Seas Driller having completed development re-
entry 31/26A-A4 on December 28.  The semisub Kan Tan IV on December 30
spudded exploration well 21/16-4, south of the Durward prospect, for
Amerada.  The rig had previously abandoned Chevron's Irish sector
wildcat 56/15-1 after disappointing results (NSL 1037/14).  Amoco
reports the jack-up Cecil Provine completed Bessemer development well
49/23-E2 as a gas producer on December 23 and the same day spudded
Beaufort development well 49/23-E3.

Arco is waiting on weather to move off tight exploration well 50/26A-7,
which is now complete.  It is thought the well, which is believed to be
untested, will be abandoned.  The rig goes next to spud exploration
well 49/28-17 for Arco.  BP reports it is expecting the semisub Ocean
Alliance out of Cromarty by next week to spud west of Shetland
appraisal 204/25B-6.  It is not clear at this stage what prospect this
well is appraising.  It lies to the east of last year's tight
exploration well 204/25B-5, southeast of Foinaven.  Elsewhere, BP is
expecting the semisub Benreoch shortly from Texaco to spud exploration
well 9/9C-16.  The rig is carrying out some construction work in the
Erskine area, having completed development well 23/26B-20.  BP also
reports the semisub Transocean 8 has completed Andrew development well
16/28-A3 and on January 1 spudded 16/28-A4.

British Gas spudded Crosby prospect exploration well 110/14-5, with the
jack-up Glomar Adriatic XI, on December 26.  The rig abandoned
Laggantulloch prospect exploration well 111/15-1 as a tight hole on
December 23.  The well is understood to be dry (NSL 1037/14).  Over the
Christmas period Chevron has completed two more Britannia Field
development wells - 15/30-M4, with the semisub Sovereign Explorer, and
16/26-B5, with the semisub Sedco 711.  The former spudded 15/30-M5 on
December 26, while the latter spudded 16/26-B6 on December 28.

Conoco has reached TD on exploration well 15/19-7, to the north of the
MacCulloch Field.  The semisub Sedco Explorer is operating.  This well
is understood to be targeting a Piper prospect.  There has been no news
yet of any planned test programme.  On exploration well 22/19B-5,
Conoco kicked off a mechanical sidetrack with the semisub Drill Star on
January 2.  The rig is now drilling ahead.  Kerr-McGee spudded the
second back-to-back Janice prospect appraisal 30/17A-12, with the
semisub Transocean 9, on December 30.  Appraisal 30/17A-11 was
suspended after a successful test programme (NSL 1036/12).

Phillips completed Deborah development well 48/30-14, with the jack-up
Rowan California, on December 21, releasing the rig to stack.  Oryx has
been delayed completing Lyell workover 3/2-A08z, with the semisub
Neddrill 6.  This well is being converted from a producer to an
injector.  Depending on the weather the operator now expects to be able
to finish operations next week.  Shell has run into mechanical problems
on both of its current Central North Sea E&A wells.  Shearwater
appraisal 22/30B-15 has still not managed to get started on a test
programme.  The jack-up Galaxy 1 has been operating at TD since mid-
November.  NSL now estimates this well is likely to be operational
until late-February, unless Shell postpones the testing programme.  On
deep exploration well 22/29-6 the semisub Henry Goodrich is plugging
back and preparing to kick off a second mechanical sidetrack having run
into problems downhole.

In the southern basin, Shell may soon have better news to report.  The
jack-up Britannia is reported to be operating at a TD of 10,768 ft on
Hamlet prospect exploration well 49/24-20 having run 7-inch liner,
which could imply a test programme.  In the Northern North Sea Shell
reports the semisub Sedco 712 has spudded Osprey development well
211/23A-P7, having completed P4.  Texaco is understood to be close to
completing exploration well 15/29A-11, with the semisub Glomar Arctic
III.

In the Norwegian sector Amoco is drilling the first new well from the
Valhall WP platform - 2/8-F1.  The jack-up Maersk Guardian completed
batch setting casing early in December.  In the Dutch sector Amoco
reports the jack-up Arch Rowan spudded exploration well P/11-2 on
December 29.  Occidental spudded exploration well L/11-A2 on December
23, with the jack-up Neddrill 3 and NAM reports the jack-up Ensco 70
suspended exploration well L/13-17re as a gas well, following a test,
on December 21.  The rig is in port undergoing an upgrade.

ENTERPRISE BOOSTS NELSON AREA ACREAGE IN FARM-IN DEAL WITH BP

Enterprise Oil is acquiring licence interests in four blocks close to
its Central North Sea Nelson Field.  Under a farm-in agreement with BP,
Enterprise is acquiring significant equity stakes in blocks 21/9 (30%),
21/15A (30%), 21/15B (35%) and 22/12A (40%).  In return, the company is
paying BP's share of the costs of a major 3D seismic survey covering
the three blocks (NSL 1023/10).  The survey, which got under way in
October but was suspended the following month due to poor weather, is
scheduled to be re-started early this year.

In a separate deal, Enterprise is acquiring Kerr-McGee's equity in
block 21/15A, bringing its stake in the acreage to about 36.25%.  In
addition, the company has secured a 45% holding in block 22/7,
immediately northeast of Nelson.  The interest was acquired through an
acreage swap with Elf in 1994 and a cash purchase from Total in 1995.
Following the deals, Enterprise will have equity interests in 14 blocks
in the Nelson area.

"These deals provide an excellent opportunity to capitalise on our
knowledge of the Nelson area where we will now have the leading acreage
position," says Mark Hope, Enterprise's UK general manager.  "We
believe interpretation of the new seismic, together with a thorough
review of all existing data, will provide new drilling opportunities in
an area where existing infrastructure would allow small discoveries to
be developed profitably," he adds.

The Nelson Field, discovered in 1988, has been producing oil at rates
of up to 190,000 b/d since coming on stream in February 1994.  Two
existing oil finds - 21/15-2, drilled in 1981, and 22/12-1, drilled in
1988 - are to be evaluated with a view to further appraisal in the
future.

HSE INVESTIGATES UK YARD BLAST THAT CLAIMED THREE LIVES

The Health and Safety Executive is investigating the death of three
workers at Amec Process and Energy's Howdon yard, Tyneside, on December
21, following a catastrophic pressure release.  The men were carrying
out pressure tests on the pipework of a new module for Maersk Oil and
Gas's Tyra West project, when it is understood high-pressure nitrogen
escaped into the atmosphere at high velocity.  Four other men suffered
minor injuries and shock.  The HSE said:  "Our investigation will
continue until we have found the reason for the accident.  The
investigation will not only look at the physical evidence, but those
working at the site will be interviewed.  We will also examine whether
there have been any breaches of health and safety law."

The yard remained closed over Christmas and New Year, following the
tragedy, but re-opened on January 3.  However, work on the Tyra module
involved remained suspended until the end of last week while the HSE
continued its investigations.  The HSE is expected to publish a report
on its preliminary findings shortly.

ENSCO 92 ACCIDENT VICTIM DIES

The crewman injured on board the jack-up Ensco 92 late last year (NSL
1037/18), died in hospital shortly afterwards, Arco British has
confirmed.  The rig was working for Arco on exploration well 50/26A-7,
which has now been completed.  The rig is waiting on weather to move
off location to exploration well 49/28-17.  The HSE continues to
investigate the circumstances of the accident.

The crewman is believed to have suffered serious head and neck injuries
when he was hit by a high-pressure release of nitrogen gas from a
cylinder during a lifting operation.  Initial reports suggest a
"nitrogen quad" (a rack of 48 bottles of nitrogen) was being lifted by
a crane when one of the slings caught under a valve releasing gas at an
estimated pressure of 4,400 psi.  The casualty was knocked back against
the engine room bulkhead.

CONTRACTORS AIM TO TRANSFER SHARE OF RISK BACK TO OPERATORS

Contractors who have shouldered an increased burden of the contractual
and insurance risks involved in the process of offshore drilling are
now seeking to take advantage of improving market conditions to reduce
their risk profile.

At the beginning of the 1980s contractors enjoyed a period of high
dayrates and were required to carry minimal risks under typical
drilling contracts with oil companies.  With the collapse of the rig
market from the mid-1980s, contractors were forced to accept lower
rates and then increasingly onerous contractual liabilities.

Responsibility for insurance and legal requirements such as third party
risk and pollution were passed to the contractor who also had to accept
"catch-all" cancellation clauses which would allow early contract
termination under virtually any eventuality and in any event at as
little as 30 days notice.

Since the beginning of 1995, led by the North Sea, the worldwide
drilling rig market, particularly for semi-submersibles, has swung
heavily in favour of the contractor.  Rising demand, notably for deep
water operations, and tightening supply as worldwide activity picks up
have transformed the market fundamentals.

Firstly dayrates began to rise and then as availability became
increasingly perceived to be a problem, contractors have been able to
negotiate long-term contracts to replace the well-to-well fixtures
which have been the standard fare for the past 10 years.

With profitable operations and a degree of employment security ensured
for the immediate foreseeable future, contractors are now turning their
attention to off-loading some of the contractual risk as contracts come
up for renewal.  While this is being resisted by some operators, there
are contractors who consider the changes are no more than ofair and
equitable.

However, contractors may find it harder to win back the contractual
ground ceded in the 1980s than to secure higher dayrates and longer
contracts.  Oil company contracts managers are familiar with the market
and accept that circumstances have changed.  However, insurance and
legal managers are perhaps less influenced by commercial factors and
may never have known a time when oil companies shouldered most of the
risk burden in a drilling contract.

January 9, 1996

1995 IS YEAR OF NORTHWEST EUROPEAN MARKET RECOVERY

The past 12 months have been marked by a major recovery in the
Northwest European mobile drilling rig market.  This was most
pronounced in the semi-submersible sector where fleet contraction in
recent years left supply unable to cope with the increase in demand,
driving up dayrates and drawing in equipment from around the world.  In
the jack-up market the improvement was more modest and indeed it took a
recovery in Dutch and Norwegian activity to sustain the market in the
face of a fall in UK activity.

During 1995 NW European semi-submersible drilling rig demand totalled
34.6 rig years, up 23% on the 1994 total of 28.1.  In spite of this
recovery NW European semi demand is still at a relatively low level
historically.  Since 1981, annual demand has only been lower in 1987
and 1994 but activity over the past year should be viewed in the
context of a continuing recovery in demand which began towards the end
of 1994.

Further evidence of the turnaround in the NW European semi market is
signalled by a semi mobilising into the region for the first time since
1992 and 1995 was the first year since 1992 that there was a net growth
in the semi fleet which increased from 44 to 45 units.  The increase in
the number of rigs being actively marketed increased more substantially
as two cold stacked semis rejoined the active fleet during the year and
two others are being reactivated at year-end.  In addition, at the end
of the year no less than three semis are en route to the North sea and
two others are committed to follow.

Semi departures in 1995, in spite of the tightening North Sea market,
were a reflection of the growing worldwide demand for high
specification units.  Increasing deep water drilling activity in the
US, West Africa and South America created competition for rigs which
drove up rates and severely limited opportunities to mobilise rigs back
into the North Sea.

1995 NORTH SEA SEMI-SUBMERSIBLE MARKET

While semi demand rose substantially in the UK in 1995, this was partly
offset by a fall in Norwegian demand.  However, this at least ensured
that surplus Norwegian units were able to provide some relief in an
over-heating UK market.  In the UK semi demand totalled just over 26
rig years in 1995, up 42% from the 1994 total of 18.3.  In Norway, a
reduction in development drilling cut semi demand from 9.01 rig years
in 1994 to 7.91 in 1995, a fall of over 12%.

The marked increase in UK semi activity in 1995 was entirely due an
increase in demand for development drilling.  In 1994, 9.95 rig years
of UK semi demand was absorbed by exploration and appraisal activity,
while development and re-entry requirements accounted for 8.36 rig
years.  In 1995, the exploration total was almost unchanged at 9.94 rig
years while development demand increased by 93% to 16.1.

Big increases in development drilling were posted by Agip, Amerada,
British Gas, BP, Chevron, Shell and Texaco.  It is likely that
exploration demand would have also increased in 1995 but the heavy
fleet commitment to long-term development work meant there was a
shortage of equipment for short-term exploration drilling so that
postponements were not uncommon.

In Norway, there was actually a slight increase in exploration drilling
with semis in 1995 to 4.13 rig years compared with 3.73 the previous
year.  However, reductions in development operations by Conoco, Elf,
Shell and Statoil cut demand from 5.3 to 3.8 rig years.

The reduction in domestic demand and rise in UK activity and rates
encouraged Norwegian contractors to move rigs to the UK.  West
Vanguard, Maersk Jutlander and Transocean 8 moved to the UK early in
1995 on the heals of the Sovereign Explorer and Ross Isle which made
the switch in 1994.  Having faced the mobilisation of the West Alpha
and West Delta to the Far East in 1994, Norwegian operators made early
moves in 1995 to secure rig availability for a planned increase in
development drilling activity from 1996 to the end of the decade.

Statoil negotiated an historic 10-year co-operation deal with
Transocean initially signing up four semis for long-term periods
including the return of the Ross Isle from the UK.  Norsk Hydro and BP
followed with fixtures to bring the West Vanguard and Maersk Jutlander
back from the UK.  Later in the year Esso booked the return of the West
Alpha from China in 1996 for development drilling on its Balder Field
while Statoil further imposed itself on the market by fixing the
Deepsea Trym for three years.  The rig is due back in the North Sea
from Mexico in April 1996.

The return of the Ocean Alliance, Kingsnorth Explorer, Ocean Nomad and
Ocean Princess to the UK was secured on the basis of confirmed
contracts but by the end of the year the owners of the Byford Dolphin
and Transocean Seeker were prepared to take the speculative risk of
beginning to mobilise from the Far East to the North Sea without a
contract.  This was as much a reflection of the weak floater market in
the Asia/Pacific region as the drawing power of the North Sea.

The great importance of a relatively small number of operators in
underwriting the bulk of UK demand was again emphasised in 1995.  The
top three operators of semis, Amerada, BP and Shell accounted for 55.1%
of total UK semi demand in 1995.  This was slightly down on their
market share in 1994 of 56.8% but in absolute terms these `Group 1'
operators clocked up a total of 14.34 rig years of semi demand in the
past 12 months compared with 10.4 rig years in 1994.

The next tranche of UK operators generating more than one rig year of
demand have been classed above as `Group 2'.  In 1995, there were four
operators in this group, Chevron, Mobil, Texaco and Total amassing a
total of 5.62 rig years of semi activity.  In 1994, only two operators,
Kerr-McGee and Texaco accounted for 2.45 rig years in this intermediate
category.

The remaining operators with less than one rig year of activity apiece
are classed as `Group 3'.  In 1995 there were 12 companies in this
category accounting for a total of 6.08 rig years of demand compared
with 17 companies and 5.46 rig years of demand in 1994.  The reduction
in the number of smaller operators and the below average increase in
activity by Group 3 operators is believed to be a consequence of the
tight semi market in the UK in 1995 which prevented a number of smaller
operators proceeding with short-term exploration programmes.

The forecast of UK activity split in 1996 is based on current drilling
intentions with an adjustment to allow for the postponement of some
planned work due to high rig rates, lack of availability and failure to
secure partner approval.  Any curtailment in activity resulting from
tight availability is expected to impact particularly on Group 3 plans.

An analysis of Norwegian operator activity reveals that the big three
of Statoil, Norsk Hydro and Saga actually sustained semi activity in
1995 at 6.43 rig years compared with 6.39 the previous year.  The
reduction in Norwegian activity was in fact due to a drop in demand
from other operators from 2.62 to 1.48 rig years.

Dayrates surge in 1995 on back of semi shortage

While it was November 1995 before every marketed semi in the region was
on contract and working, it was as early as February 1995 that 100% of
marketed semis had a contractual commitment.  Apart from a slight blip
at the end of the year when Rig 42 re-entered the market (although it
is not operational until April 1996) the `contracted utilisation' has
remained at 100% ever since.  Since March 1995, the North Sea Rig
Forecast Availability Index which measures rig availability in the
upcoming three month period has remained almost continually at zero.

With `contracted utilisation' at 100% and availability at zero, the
inevitable consequence was strong upward pressure on dayrates which
effectively doubled during the course of the year.  At the beginning of
the year the dayrate range for a standard short-term fixture of a third
generation rig in the UK was #20,000 ($31,200) to #36,000 ($56,000).
The fixture which set the top of the range was scheduled for an August
start while the bottom the range was fixed by a one-well fixture of a
second generation unit.  A third generation semi was fixed in January
for a 12-month period at $40,000 a day, while a similar unit was fixed
to drill a high pressure, high temperature well at #28,000 ($43,680).

As operators scrambled to secure availability for 1995 and beyond rates
rose rapidly.  As early as March a second generation semi was fixed for
three months from mid-year at $70,000 a day.  A number of operators
attempted to resist the dayrate tide, setting negotiating limits at
$60,000 and then $70,000 only to see these swept aside.  Towards the
end of the year the acceleration in rates inevitably levelled out so
that the range for short-term, standard fixtures finished the year at
#44,500 ($69,000) to #48,500 ($75,000).  The range for term fixtures
for this class of rig at the end of 1995 was #48,500 ($75,000) to
#54,800 ($85,000).

While activity in Norway fell in 1995, dayrates were buoyed by UK
demand and the rise in UK rates.  However, taking account of higher
operating costs, Norwegian sector rates generally lagged UK rates for
much of 1995, a reversal of the historical norm.  The squeeze on rig
availability in the region did ensure that at least some Norwegian
contractors were able to secure contributions from operators towards
the mandatory pipe-handling upgrades which came into force in 1995.

In January 1995, the dayrate range for a short-term fixture of a third
generation semi in Norway was $55,000 to $60,000.  By the end of the
year the range is considered to be $85,000 to $91,000.  Term fixtures
of third generation units began the year in the range $65,000 to
$72,000 and ended the year in the range $75,000 to $95,000.

While Statoil agreed standard term fixtures with Transocean for four
semis starting in 1996 at rates between $75,000 and $85,000, late in
the year an operator grouping of Conoco, Shell and Elf dropped plans to
fix a semi for two years because they were not prepared to pay in
excess of $85,000 and in some cases over $100,000 for an upgraded
second generation semi.  Shortly after,  Statoil stunned contractors by
fixing a 20-year old semi Deepsea Trym (ex La Muralla) for three years
at $75,000 but it remains to be seen whether Statoil's message to the
market has the salutary impact that may have been intended.

No Norwegian semi fixtures broached the $100,000 barrier in 1996,
partly due to operator resistance and partly the lack of pure fourth
generation demand.  However, in the UK a number of semi fixtures were
concluded at dayrates above $100,000.  The contract which led the way
was for deepwater drilling in 1997 and 1998.  Mobil fixed the Jack
Bates for five wells in water depths up to 4,500ft west of Shetland at
a dayrate of $118,000 plus a lump sum of $12.5m to cover mobilisation
and upgrading.  A slot was assigned to Marathon for a deep water well
off Eire at a rate believed to be in the region of $144,000 including a
pro rata apportionment of the lump sum costs.

At the beginning of 1995 rates for short-term, high specification
fixtures in the UK were in the range #28,000 ($43,000)to #43,500
($68,000).  By the end of the year the range was #52,000 ($80,000) to
#71,000 ($110,000) for fixtures starting in 1996, a virtual doubling
over the course of the year.  At the end of 1995 deep water demand
remained high worldwide maintaining upward pressure on rates at the top
of the market.

INCREASE IN DEMAND IN HOLLAND AND NORWAY OFFSETS UK REDUCTION

In spite of an 8.6% fall in UK activity, demand for jack-ups offshore
Northwest Europe grew in 1995 by 8.4% compared with the previous year.
Rising demand in Holland and Norway compensated for the UK slippage.
There was also a slight reduction in Danish demand while the first well
was drilled offshore France for 10 years.

In 1995 jack-up demand in the region totalled 31.79 rig years, compared
with 29.33 the previous year.  UK activity slipped back from 17.86 to
16.33 rig years with one factor being the initial impact of the
reduction in UK gas prices arising from the continuing privatisation of
the gas supply industry.  In Holland, there was a recovery from the
very low level of activity in 1994 when there was concern about the
fiscal regime and prospectivity.  As a result demand rose in 1995 to a
total of 7.06 rig years compared with 4.88 the previous year, an
increase of almost 45%.

Norway also posted an increase in jack-up activity in 1995 as long-term
development drilling operations got underway on a number of fields in
the Southern Norwegian sector of the North Sea.  Demand totalled 4.74
rig years including time spent in the yard by two rigs which were
upgraded on contract.  This compared with a total of 2.67 rig years in
1994.

Danish activity slipped back slightly in 1995 to 3.46 rig years
compared with 3.92 the previous year but after a cutback to three
drilling units in 1994, Maersk Oil & Gas resumed a four-rig operation
in the fourth quarter of 1995.  Amerada Hess was the only other
operator to drill offshore Denmark with a jack-up in 1995 although
Statoil drilled a well at the end of the year with the semi Deepsea
Bergen.

In the UK, British Gas has lost two-thirds of its market share in the
industrial gas supply sector and now faces the loss of its domestic
monopoly from 1997, some five years earlier than previously expected.
As a result the former state utility has over-contracted and is faced
with managing a growing surplus of gas.  While the problem is a
temporary feature of the liberalisation of the supply industry it is
expected to take some years to work through the system.

As a consequence of the fall in gas prices Conoco deferred plans to
develop the Viking Fs field, where two development wells were planned,
and suspended its contract with the Neddrill 4.  Gaps opened in Shell's
drilling sequence with the jack-up Britannia as drilling to sustain
contract deliveries to British Gas was deferred.  In the second half of
the year some operators experienced problems securing partner approval
for planned exploration wells due to the weak medium term outlook for
UK gas prices.  Other early consequences such as Phillips postponement
of additional drilling on the Judy Field and Shell's delay in the start
of its planned Shearwater development had no impact on the 1995 jack-up
market.

The NW European jack-up fleet was relatively stable in 1995, starting
the year totalling 34 units and ending the year at 35.  Early in 1995
the Neddrill Trigon left for Argentina and a contract with Total.
Effectively this was the only departure of a North Sea rig during the
year although the Perro Negro 5 arrived from Italy to drill a well for
Elf in the Bay of Biscay offshore France and then left again.  Apart
from the brief visit of the Saipem jack-up there were two other
additions to the jack-up fleet.  Global Marine completed the extensive
upgrading of the former British Gas accommodation/slant drilling unit
Bay Driller which entered competitive operations as the Glomar Adriatic
XI.  Santa Fe brought its heavy-duty jack-up Monitor back from
Australia where it had been mobilised by Esso in 1994.

Looking at UK jack-up demand in terms of operator activity, just three
companies, Mobil, Phillips and Shell maintained more than two rig years
of activity during 1995.  In total these three `Group 1' companies
accounted for 7.05 rig years of activity.  There were five companies,
Amoco, Arco, BHP, BP and Conoco in the `Group 2' middle range which
each clocked-up between one and two rig years with jack-ups in the UK
accounting for a total of 6.83 rig years of demand.  The remaining
eight `Group 3' operators which generated less than one rig year of
activity apiece accounted for a total of just 2.3 rig years of activity
in 1995.

This profile of operator activity is somewhat different from 1994 when
overall UK activity was slightly higher.  Group 1 activity was less in
1994 with just two operators, Phillips and Shell amassing a total of
5.7 rig years between them.  There was more Group 2 activity with six
companies, Amoco, Arco, BP, Conoco, Elf and Mobil maintaining a total
of eight rig years of jack-up activity.  Group 3 comprised a total of
13 companies which generated a total of 4 rig years of demand.

Like the semi market the UK jack-up market in 1995 was reliant on a
smaller number of operators.  There were fewer operators drilling just
one or two wells in 1995 than in 1994.  This was a consequence of a
drop in UK jack-up exploration activity (see below) which may have been
partly due to smaller operators dropping planned wells due to reduced
gas price expectations and partly due to the generally tight North Sea
jack-up market which left few opportunities to secure a rig at short
notice.

The outlook suggests no individual operator will sustain more than two
rig years of demand during 1996, increasing the proportion of Group 2
and Group 3 operators in the market.

UK jack-up development drilling up, but exploration down

Development drilling and production related operations using jack-up
units increased in the UK in 1995 by almost 27% in spite of the slight
overall drop in UK demand.  The converse is that jack-up exploration
operations measured in terms of rig demand dropped by 47% compared with
1994.

Increases in development drilling and re-entry operations by Amoco,
Arco, Conoco, Lasmo, Mobil and Phillips lifted activity to a total of
11.9 rig years in 1995.  However, an across the board fall in
exploration drilling resulted in jack-up demand for e&a work falling
from 8.5 rig years in 1994 to 4.5 in 1995.

Partly exploration fell in 1995 because the UK upstream activity cycle
had moved into a development drilling phase, but in the second half of
the year fears about weak gas prices in the medium term had an impact
on exploration.  The tight rig market in the region also left few
opportunities for smaller operators to pick up a rig at short notice.
It is evident from the analysis above that fewer small UK operators
drilled with jack-ups in 1995.

Development drilling and production-related activity with jack-ups also
increased in the Netherlands in 1995.  In 1994, there was just 2.37 rig
years of jack-up demand on development operations but in 1995 this
increased to 4.33 as a result of additional activity by Unocal,
Wintershall, Occidental and NAM with only Elf Petroland bucking the
trend by increasing its commitment to exploration in 1995.  There was
also a slight increase in jack-up demand for exploration drilling in
Holland in 1995 with 2.67 rig years of demand generated compared with
2.52 in 1994.

Jack-up rates rise on balanced market

The Northwest European jack-up market maintained a fairly close
supply/demand balance in 1995 and while rates rose significantly at the
beginning of the year they quickly reached a plateau.  Although
utilisation levels were broadly similar to the semi market, the jack-up
market lacked both the severity of the short-term semi shortage and the
fears about medium term availability which sustained the semi rate
rise.

In 1995, utilisation of jack-ups averaged 87.2% calculated on the basis
of rigs in employment and 98.8% based on the percentage of marketed
rigs with current or future contract commitments.  This compared with
83.8% and 92.5% respectively for the same measures in 1994.

After being weak for much of 1994, jack-up availability began to
tighten at the end of the year and then all but disappeared by March
1995, at least on a short-term basis.  The North Sea Rig Forecast
Availability Index which remained in the range of 20-40% throughout
1994, fell to 18% at the end of 1994 and then quickly to zero by the
end of March 1995.

At the beginning of 1995 the dayrate range for short-term jack-up
fixtures for standard UK sector operations was $26,000 to $29,000.  By
March 1995 the range was $35,000 to $45,000 and changed relatively
little the rest of the year apart from some firming of the bottom end
of the range to a maximum of $41,000 in the fourth quarter.
In spite of the rising rates and tight short-term availability there
was no switch in the UK from short-term to long-term fixing and through
much of the year fixture volume remained low so that there was little
upward pressure on dayrates after the initial hike in the first
quarter.  The term fixtures that did take place mirrored or slightly
lagged the short-term range indicating contractors shared operators
views that medium and long-term availability was not a concern.  At the
very end of the year there were indications of the bottom-end of the
range falling away slightly due to rising first quarter availability
but this was based on evidence from the Dutch sector.

The market for heavy-duty jack-ups in the UK in 1995 was influenced
more by semi rates than the jack-up market.  Short-term rates began the
year in the range $55,000 to $65,000 and ended the year between $80,000
and $90,000.  The peak rate for this class of rig during the year was
for a long-term contract starting in the fourth quarter of 1996 which
was fixed in October 1995 at $105,000.  In the first half of the year a
term fixture was concluded for Central UK sector operations in 1996 at
$75,000.

In Norway, rates for heavy-duty jack-up fixtures ranged from a low of
$72,000 for a one-well in-fill fixture, to a high of around $106,000
for one-year plus options starting in the fourth quarter of 1996.
However, two other term fixtures in Norway were closer to the bottom
end of this range at initial rates of $75,000 and $82,000.

Dayrates in the Netherlands in 1995 were similar to those in the UK
ranging from just over $30,000 at the beginning of the year to a peak
of just under $42,000.  Two term contracts were agreed under floating
rate mechanisms linked to the market.

NORTH SEA RIG FORECAST via NewsNet
January 9, 1996

NORWEGIAN SEMI SUPPLY COULD INCREASE FURTHER

Statoil's fixture of the semi Deepsea Trym (ex La Muralla) for a three-
year period from May 1995 ensures the return of yet another semi to the
Norwegian sector in 1996 although it will be nine years since the
Odfjell purchase last worked in the North Sea as the Nortrym.  The
Deepsea Trym is due to leave Mexico in February to mobilise to the
North Sea.

The Norwegian sector semi fleet currently totals nine units but  with
the confirmation of the mobilisation of the Deepsea Trym is on course
to increase to at least 12 by May.  The West Alpha left China in the
first week of 1996 to begin a three month tow back to the Norway where
it will begin a two-year contract with Esso in April.  The Maersk
Jutlander has for some time been committed to return from the UK to
Norway in May 1996 to begin a 27-month contract with BP.

While the current forecast for Norwegian activity in 1996 is based on
12 rigs in operation from May, it remains possible that the total could
be 13.  Without a 13th semi moving into Norway it will be difficult for
Amerada, Conoco, Deminex, Mobil and Shell to drill planned exploration
wells in 1996.  However, Conoco, Shell and Elf earlier abandoned a
tender to fix a semi for two years from 1996 due to high dayrates and
the low technical merit so of the rigs offered.

Now Conoco and Shell are considering the options again with a view to a
potential co-operation with Amerada, Deminex and Mobil.  Drilling rigs
under consideration are believed to include the Byford Dolphin,
currently en route speculatively from the Far East, and the Nanhai VI,
currently in China but being marketed by Stena Drilling against a
potential purchase.  Whether a contract is agreed is very much
dependent on the commercial aspects of the deal.  All the operators
also remain interested in sublet opportunities with other Norwegian
operators.  For example, it may be that Statoil could have some slots
available in its schedule with the Deepsea Trym but this is not yet
clear.

A number of other issues remain outstanding before the 1996 Norwegian
sector semi picture is finalised.  Statoil has still to fix a second
additional exploration semi contract to start during 1996.  The fourth
generation Transocean semi Ross Rig remains available from the third
quarter of 1996 and would appear to be the most flexible solution for
Statoil if commercial terms can be agreed.  Norsk Hydro, Saga and
Statoil await the outcome of the 15th Licence Round awards before
selecting a rig for anticipation deep water operations from the end of
1996 or early in 1997.  While Saga remains a proponent of the EfEx
approach of using a converted second generation unit, it is thought
Statoil may prefer a more conventional fourth generation unit.  This
might be another reason for fixing the Ross Rig for 1996 exploration
slot.

Statoil is also considering bids from Halliburton, Smedvig and
Transocean for construction and operation of a novel Swath catamaran
vessel for completion and workover operations on the Aasgard Field.
However, it is understood that tender prices are well above the level
that Statoil envisaged in its initial evaluation of the concept and it
remains to be seen whether the project can survive a higher capital
cost.

In the UK, some of Shell's plans for the latter part of 1996 remain
unclear.  The company has deferred its planned Kingfisher development
on which pre-drilling was scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of
1996.  A letter of intent had been awarded to Sonat Offshore for the
semi John Shaw to drill at least six wells.  The John Shaw is now back
in the market but Shell could still take the rig for one of two
potential outstanding requirements.

It needs a semi for four to seven wells on the Curlew development,
again from the fourth quarter of 1996 but it is not yet clear whether
Shell will operate the semi itself or will leave that to the lead
contractor for the project development as a whole.  Shell also has a
requirement for an additional semi for an exploration programme in the
UK from sometime in the second half of 1996.  If no suitable rigs are
available from Shell's Win 90s lead drilling contractors then this
programme could be deferred.  However, as well as the John Shaw from
Sonat, the Sedco Forex semi Sedco 711 is also available from the third
quarter.

Shell is also understood to have indicated an interest in taking an
assignment of the Benreoch from BP but it is not yet clear whether any
slots will be available.  BP has extended the Benreoch for 12 months
from May 1996 but as yet does not have a full programme for the rig.
Vacant slots could still be filled internally by BP but it is
understood that both Conoco and Shell have been approached as potential
sub-lessors should BP fail to fill the schedule.  Elsewhere BP
continues to await development approval for the Schiehallion Field
before making rig commitments for the drilling programme from late 1996
and early 1997.

TRENT CUTBACK ILLUSTRATES UK JACK-UP MARKET FRAGILITY

The vulnerability of UK jack-up demand in 1996 to cutbacks was
illustrated in December by Arco's decision to terminate its contract
with the Maersk Enhancer.  Arco has decided to drill one less well on
the Trent platform so that the rig is available from early February
although the notice period for contract termination is not up until mid-
March.  Previously Arco had planned to drill on Trent until June
followed by some exploration drilling during platform installation
before returning, potentially with the Enhancer to undertake completion
tiebacks until late in the year.

Ranger's Southern UK drilling plans for 1996 have been blowing hot and
cold as the implications of the gas price outlook are digested by the
operator and its partners.  Until late in 1995, Ranger was planning
more than one well in the third quarter of 1996.  Then the whole
programme appeared in danger but now it seems to be back on the rails
though with perhaps just one well surviving.

Uncertainty also surrounds Wintershall's Windermere development in
blocks 49/9B and 49/4B.  Project go-ahead is still outstanding and the
longer it is delayed the more difficult it will be for Wintershall to
start development drilling in 1996.

In November, BP cutback its southern UK sector drilling plans and
trimmed the F G McClintock contract back from one year from November
1995 to just one well.  Now BP has firmed-up a second well for the rig
and will keep it until May 1996.  BP's Southern UK jack-up programme
still remains somewhat uncertain thereafter.  It is expected that it
will retain the Neddrill 7 in the second half of the year but is
thought likely to release the McClintock.

While some southern UK gas exploration and development drilling plans
for 1996 continue to be fragile, increasing Dutch activity continues to
take up the slack.  Allowances made for anticipated UK cutbacks and
assumptions made about Dutch activity mean that there is no net change
in the 1996 forecast of jack-up demand which remains at 34 rig years.

As expected Occidental has extended the Neddrill 3 in Holland from June
until February 1997 and is shortly due to take delivery of the Neddrill
4 for a one-year programme.  Elf Petroland has fixed the Cecil Provine
for two wells plus an option from March 1996 when the rig is due to be
released by Amoco in the UK.  However, the Arch Rowan, which in
December moved from the UK to Holland to drill a well for Amoco, is
likely to return to the UK for Amoco in the first quarter before
crossing back to Amoco in Holland in the second half of the year.

Wintershall is close to fixing a jack-up for a Netherlands programme of
two firm wells plus three optional wells from March 1996, an earlier
start than previously expected.  The Rowan California is believed to be
emerging as a front-runner for the contract.  The rig was stacked off
Great Yarmouth in the UK at the end of 1995 after being released by
Phillips Petroleum.  Conoco Netherlands is still waiting for partner
approval to drill a 21-day exploration well which is unlikely now
before the second quarter at the earliest.

The Neddrill 9 still has a two to three-month gap in its schedule from
April ahead of a well for RWE-DEA and a 300-day contract with Clyde
Netherlands which is due to start in August although a start as late as
October is still possible.

In the UK, Elf has issued tender invitations for the provision of two
jack-ups for the second phase of development drilling on the
Elgin/Franklin project, each for a firm period of 30 months plus
options for four six-month wells and six one-month completions.  One
rig is for delivery mid-1997 and the other mid-1998.  It is believed
that one of the requirements is effectively a market check against the
Galaxy I which Elf has already fixed for a minimum of 18 months from
October 1996 but this has not yet been confirmed.  Newbuildings are
expected to be bid to Elf for the 1998 commencement but this could
prove to be in competition with the Galaxy.  The earlier start date
could suit the Magellan or the Rowan Gorilla II and Gorilla IV (both in
the US) while the Rowan newbuild Rowan Gorilla V is not due to be
delivered before 1998.

It is now clear the jack-up Neddrill Trigon, currently in Argentina,
will return to the North Sea in 1996 although the arrival date is still
subject to Total options.  The earliest arrival is May and the latest
is September.  The rig is believed to be in line for a two-year
contract with Saga in Norway for a development drilling programme on
the Varg Field, although possibly not starting until late 1997.
However, Saga has yet to confirm the fixture although it is expected to
do so later in January.

STATOIL SENDS MARKET SIGNAL WITH DEEPSEA TRYM FIXTURE

Statoil sent a strong signal on rates to Norwegian drilling contractors
when it fixed the second generation semi Deepsea Trym (ex La Muralla)
for a firm three year period from May 1996 at a fixed dayrate of
$75,000.  The rig is currently in Mexico and it appears that Statoil
will not directly compensate mobilisation and upgrading costs likely to
be well in excess of $10m.  Odfjell Drilling purchased La Muralla
against the Statoil contract for a price believed to be in the region
of $27m.

Other Norwegian contractors have recently been bidding second
generation rigs into Norway at rates in excess of $100,000 a day.
Apart from making a significant saving over a three-year contract
Statoil may also be hoping that it can use its dominant market position
in controlling half the Norwegian sector semi fleet to put a cap on
rapidly rising rates.  It would appear to be signalling to contractors
that it is not prepared to accept any rate even if it might be dictated
by the market at large.

In the UK a term fixture of a third generation semi confirmed the
current market range at up to $85,000 while a fourth generation semi
was fixed for a deep water well west of Shetland in 1996 at a rate of
$110,000.

Rates for jack-up fixtures in Holland in December are thought to have
been coloured by the anticipation of increasing rig availability in the
first quarter of 1996.  As a result fixtures were agreed at rates
believed to be around $38,500 and $39,000 a day.  In the UK a short-
term fixture was agreed at a rate believed to be in the region of
$41,000 based on a tender round which closed at the end of October.
