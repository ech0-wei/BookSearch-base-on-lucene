<title>Justice Department Letter on CDA</title>
<body>

<pre>

May 3, 1995

Honorable Patrick J. Leahy
United States Senate
Washington, DC  20510

Dear Senator Leahy:

I write to respond to your letter of March 1, 1995 concerning our 
prosecution of violations of federal child pornography and obscenity 
laws and your April 21, 1995 request for the views of the United States 
Department of Justice on the "Communications Decency Act," which has been 
incorporated as title IV of the proposed "Telecommunications Competition 
and Deregulation Act of 1995," S. 652. In accordance with your request, 
the analysis of the Communications Decency Act focuses on sections 402 
and 405 of the bill.

The Department's Criminal Division has, indeed, successfully prosecuted 
violations of federal child pornography and obscenity laws which were 
perpetrated with computer technology.  In addition, we have applied 
current law to this emerging problem while also discovering areas where 
the new technology may present challenges to successful prosecution.  
While we agree with the goal of various legislative proposals designed 
to keep obscenity and child pornography off of the information superhighway, 
we are currently developing a legislative proposal that will best meet 
these challenges and provide additional prosecutorial tools.  This
legislative package is being developed while taking into consideration 
the need to protect fundamental rights guaranteed by the First Amendment.

With respect to the communications Decency Act, while we understand 
that section 402 is intended to provide users of online services the 
same protection against obscene and harassing communications afforded 
to telephone subscribers, this provision would not accomplish that goal.  
Instead, it would significantly thwart enforcement of existing laws 
regarding obscenity and child pornography, create several ways for 
distributors and packages of obscenity and child pornography to avoid 
criminal liability, and threaten important First Amendment and privacy 
rights.

Similarly, while we understand that section 405 of this bill is intended 
to expand privacy protections to "digital" communications, such 
communications are already protected under existing law.  Moreover, 
this provision would have the unintended consequences of jeopardizing 
law enforcement's authority to conduct lawful, court-ordered wiretaps 
and would prevent system administrators from protecting their systems 
when they are under attack by computer hackers.

Despite the flaws in these provisions, the Administration applauds the 
primary goal of this legislation:  prevent obscenity from being widely 
transmitted over telecommunications networks to which minors have access.  
However, the legislation raises complex policy issues that merit close 
examination prior to Congressional action.  We recommend that a comprehensive 
review be undertaken of current laws and law enforcement resources for 
prosecuting online obscenity and child pornography, and the technical means 
available to enable parents and users to control the commercial and non 
commercial communications they receive over interactive telecommunications 
systems.

The following are the Department's primary objections to sections 402 and 405 
of the pending telecommunication bill:

First, Section 402 of the bill would impose criminal sanctions on the 
transmission of constitutionally protected speech.  Specifically, subsections 
402(a)(1) and (b)(2) of the bill would criminalize the transmission of
 indecent communications, which are protected by the First Amendment.  
In _Sable Communications of Cal. v. FCC_, 492 U.S. 115 (1989), the Supreme
Court ruled that any restrictions on the content of protected  speech in 
media other than broadcast media must advance a compelling state interest 
and be accomplished by the "least restrictive means."  By relying on 
technology relevant only to 900 number services, section 402 fails to 
take into account less restrictive alternatives utilizing existing and 
emerging technologies which enable parents and other adult users to control 
access to content.

Nearly ten years of litigation, along with modifications of the 
regulations, were necessary before the current statute as applied
to audiotext services, or "dial-a-porn" calling numbers, was upheld 
as constitutional.  See _Dial Information Services v. Thornburg_, 938 
F. 2d 1535 (2d Cir. 1991).  The proposed amendment in section 40-2 of 
the bill would jeopardize the enforcement of the existing dial-a-porn 
statute by inviting additional constitutional challenges, with the concomitant 
diversion of law enforcement resources.

Second, the definition of "knowingly" in section 402 of the bill would 
cripple obscenity prosecutions.  Under subsection 402(e), only those 
persons with "actual knowledge" of the "specific content of the 
communication" could be held criminally liable.  this definition would 
make it difficult, if not impossible, to prove guilt, and the standard is 
higher than the prevailing knowledge requirements under existing obscenity 
and child sexual exploitation statutes.  Under _Miller v. California_, 
413 U.S. 629 (1973), the government must only prove that a person being 
prosecuted under an obscenity statute had knowledge of the general nature 
of the material being distributed.  Large-scale distributors of child 
pornography and other obscene materials--among the most egregious violators 
-- do not read or view each obscene item they distribute.  the proposed 
definition in subsection 402(e) would make it nearly impossible for the 
government to establish the necessary knowledge requirement and would 
thereby severely handicap enforcement of existing statutes.

Third, section 402 would add new terms and defenses that would thwart
ongoing enforcement of the dial-a-porn statute.  Currently, the government 
is vigorously enforcing the existing dial-a-porn statute.  It took more than
ten years for the government to be able to do so, due to constitutional 
challenges.  The proposed amendment to this statute fundamentally changes its 
provisions and subjects it to renewed constitutional attack which would hinder 
current enforcement efforts.

Fourth, section 402 would do significant harm by inserting new and sweeping 
defenses that may be applied to nullify existing federal criminal statutes.  
The government currently enforces federal criminal laws preventing the 
distribution over computer networks of obscene and other pornographic material 
that is harmful to minors (under 18 U.S.C. section 1465, 2252 & 2423 (a)), the 
illegal solicitation of a minor by way of a computer network (under 18 U.S.C. 
section 2252), and illegal "luring" of a minor into sexual activity through 
computer conversations (under 18 U.S.C. section 2423(b)).  These statutes apply 
to all methods of "distribution" including over computer networks.  The new 
defenses proposed in subsection 402(d) would thwart ongoing government obscenity 
and child sexual exploitation prosecutions in several important ways:

* The first defense under subsection 402 (d)(1) would immunize from 
  prosecution "any action" by a defendant who operates a computer 
  bulletin board service as an outlet for the distribution of 
  pornography and obscenity so long as he does not create or later the 
  material. In fact, this defense would establish a system under which 
  distributors of pornographic material by way of computer would be 
  subject to fewer criminal sanctions than distributors of obscene 
  videos, books, or magazines.

* The second defense provided in subsection 402(d)(2) would exculpate 
  defendants who "lacked editorial control over the communications." 
  Such a defense may significantly harm the goal of ensuring that 
  obscene or pornographic material is not available on the Internet or 
  other computer networks by creating a disincentive for operators of 
  public bulletin board services to control postings on their boards.

  Moreover, persons who provide critical links in the pornography and 
  obscenity distribution chains by serving as "package fulfillment 
  centers" filling orders for obscene materials, could assert the 
  defense that they lack the requisite "editorial control." This 
  proposed defense would complicate prosecutions of entire obscenity 
  distribution chains.

* The third defense provided in subsection 402 (d)(3), containing five 
  subparts, would be available to pornographic bulletin boards operators 
  who take such innocuous steps as (A) directing users to their "on/off" 
  switches on their computer as a "means to restrict access" to certain 
  communications; (B) warning, or advertising to, users that the could 
  receive obscene material; and (C) responding to complaints about such 
  minimum, this proposed defense would lead to litigation over whether 
  such actions constitute "good faith" steps to avoid prosecution for 
  violating the section 402, and could thwart existing child pornography 
  and obscenity prosecutions.

* The fourth defense provided in subsection 402 (d)(4) would exculpate 
  defendants whose pornography business does not have the "predominate 
  purpose" of engaging in unlawful activity. This defense would severely 
  undercut law enforcement's efforts to prosecute makers and 
  distributors of noncommercial pornography and obscenity.

* The fifth defense provided in subsection 402 (d)(5) would preclude any 
  cause of action from being brought against any person who has taken 
  good faith steps to, _inter_alia_, "restrict or prevent the 
  transmission of, or access to," a communication deemed unlawful under 
  section 402. This defense would encourage intrusion by on-line service 
  providers into the private electronic mail communications of 
  individual users. The defense actually promotes intrusions into 
  private electronic mail by making it "safer" to monitor private 
  communications than to risk liability. At the same time, this defense 
  would defeat efforts by the government to enforce federal privacy 
  protections against illegal eavesdropping.

Finally, but no less significantly, section 405 amends the federal 
wiretap statute in several respects, each of which creates considerable 
problems. First, it amends the wiretap statute to add the term "digital" to 
10 USC section 2511 (see footnote #1), without considering the effect of this 
amendment on other statutory provisions.  For example, 10 USC section 2516 (1) 
provides that certain government officials may authorize an application for a 
wiretap order for wire or oral communications while 18 USC section 2516 (3) 
provides that other government officials may authorize an application for a 
wiretap order for electroniccommunications. Since section 405 does not amend 10 
USC section 2516, to include the term "digital," it would appear that _no_ 
government official has the authority to authorize an application for a wiretap 
order for digital communications. This is particularly problematic, sincethis 
investigative tool is reserved for the most serious cases, including those 
involving terrorists, organized crime, and narcotics.

Equally disconcerting, the amendment serves to protect computer hackers at the
expense of all users of the National Information Infrastructure (NII), including businesses, government agencies and individuals. Prior to 1994, wiretap statute 
allowed electronic communication services providers to monitor _voice_ 
communications to protect their systems form abuse. 18 USC section 2511 (2)(a)(i) 
(1986 version). Thus, when hackers attacked computer systems and system 
administrators monitored these communications, they had no clear statutory 
authority to do so. In October 1994, Congress finally remedied this defect by 
amending 10 USC section 2511 (2)(a)(i) to permit the monitoring of electronic 
(i.e., digital, non-voice) communications. If section 405 is enacted and these 
hacker communications are deemed digital, system administrators will once again 
be denied the statutory authority to monitor hacker communications. It would be
most unfortunate if, at the same time Congress is encouraging the widespread 
use of the NII, it passed a law giving system administrator's a Hobson's choice: 
either allow hackers to attack systems unobserved or violate federal law.

There are three other concerns as well. First, by adding the term "digital" 
without amending the suppression provisions of 18 USC section 2515, voice 
communications -- if they are deemed "digital" -- will no longer be protected 
by the statute's exclusionary rule. This would serve to reduce the privacy 
protections for phone calls.

Second, section 405 would replace the words "oral communication" with 
"communication" in 18 USC section 2511 (1)(B). This would have undesirable 
consequences for law enforcement because it would criminalize the interception 
of communications as to which there was no reasonable expectation of privacy 
(see footnote #2).

From the law enforcement perspective, there is simply no sound reason for 
eliminating this highly desirable feature of present law. Additionally, the 
amendment might also impact upon the news gathering process. For example, if
the conversation of two individuals shouting in a hotel room were recorded 
by a news reporter standing outside the room, the reporter would, under section
405, be violating the wiretap statute. Under current law, of course, the 
individuals could not complain about the recording because, by shouting loud 
enough to be heard outside the room, they lack any reasonable expectation of 
privacy.

Last, the provision in section 402 (d)(5) provides that "no cause of action may
be brought in any court ... against any person on account of any action which 
the person has taken in good faith to implement a defense authorized under this 
section ...." This would seem to suggest that any person can freely engage in 
electronic surveillance otherwise prohibited under Title III so long as they 
claim to be implementing a section 402 defense. AS such, section 402 (d)(5) 
severely weakens the privacy protections currently offered by the wiretap statute.

In sum, sections 402 and 405 of the bill would hamper the government's ongoing 
work in stopping the dissemination of obscenity and child pornography and threaten 
law enforcement's continued ability to use court-authorized wiretaps. We believe 
that a comprehensive review be undertaken to guide response to the problems that 
the Communications Decency Act seeks to address.

I assure you that the Department is aware of the growing use of computers to 
transmit and traffic obscenity and child pornography. The Criminal Division's 
Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section is aggressively investigating and 
prosecuting the distribution of child pornography and obscenity through computer 
networks, and the use of computers to locate minors for the purpose of sexual 
exploitation. AS we have discussed with your staff in a meeting focused on these 
issues, we remain committed to an aggressive effort to halt the use of computers 
to sexually exploit children and distribute obscenity.

Sincerely,

{sig}

Kent Markus
Acting Assistant Attorney General

FOOTNOTES

(1) It should be noted that "digital" communications are already covered by 
the wiretap statute. Under current law, a "digital" communications is either 
a wire communication under 18 USC sec 2510 (1) (if it contains voice) or an 
"electronic communication" under 18 USC sec 2510 (12) (if it does not contain voice). 
Since such communications are already covered, the reason for enacting section 405 is unclear, and it is difficult to predict how the courts will interpret the amendment.

(2) The definition of "oral communication" in 18 USC sec 2510 (2) contains a 
requirement that the communication to be protected must have been made under 
circumstances justifying an expectation of privacy.

<title>American Family Association Letter to Exon</title>
<body>
<pre>

April 4, 1995

The Honorable James Exon
United States Senate
528 Hart Senate Office Building
Washington, DC  20510


re:  Exon Computer Pornography Bill


Dear Senator Exon:

I write to express my great concern regarding a bill authored by you titled 
the "Communication Decency Act of 1995."  In its original form, the bill, 
which is now attached to the telecommunications bill and soon will be 
considered on the floor of the Senate, was a laudable attempt to, as you said, 
protect the Information Superhighway from becoming a red light district.  
In its current form however, the bill would provide protection for the red 
light district of the Information Superhighway from federal and state prosecution.  
I am confident that the pro-family movement in America will uniformly oppose your 
bill and, if necessary, the telecommunications bill to which it is attached, 
unless significant changes are made prior to a vote on the Senate floor.

Let me clarify, as the former Section Chief of the Child Exploitation and 
Obscenity Section, Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice, that the 
federal dial-a-porn law, in my opinion, currently prohibits commercial 
distribution of obscenity via computers.  Therefore it is unnecessary to change 
that law as your bill would do, unless you are seeking to clarify this point and 
add improvements to the law.  Also, it is my opinion, although this point may not 
be as clear or settled as the first, that federal criminal law, specifically 
Title 18 Sections 1462 and 1465 prohibits distribution of obscenity via computer 
whether or not for commercial purpose.  Further, it is my opinion that a primary 
problem regarding computer pornography is the lack of leadership and enforcement 
on this issue by the Clinton Administration.  While current laws could be 
improved, the Administration could make substantial progress in protecting 
children in particular from both obscenity and child pornography by using 
existing law to prosecute illegal pornographers who use the Internet if it had 
the will to do so.

Here are my primary objections to your bill, in its current form:  it 
provides several defenses against prosecution which have the effect of 
gutting the current dial-a-porn law, making it useless for the prosecution 
of computer obscenity crimes.  Your bill now also contains a state pre-emption 
provision that would prohibit states from providing stronger protection to 
children, should they choose to do so, than the weak provisions now contained 
in your bill.  The scienter or knowledge provision contained in your bill 
would give pornographers protection they don't now have.  The provision titled 
"Scrambling of Cable Channels for Non-subscribers" only codifies current cable 
company practice in most cities and does not provide protection to children who 
may be exposed to pornography transmitted over cable systems.  In your original 
bill you would have required a complete blockage of both the audio and video signal 
for non-subscribers of pornographic channels.  In your current bill, you merely 
require cable companies to block such material upon subscriber request.  There are 
other parts of your bill that are problematic.

Because I know that you are truly intent on providing protection to children from 
exposure to pornography, I hope that you will make significant changes to your 
bill to accomplish this goal.

Most Sincerely,
{sig}

<title>American Family Association Letter to Pressler</title>
<body>

<pre>

April 26, 1995

The Honorable Larry Pressler
United States Senate
243 Russell Senate Office Building
Washington, DC 20510

Dear Senator Pressler:

In response to a request from your staff I am writing this letter to set 
forth my concerns regarding the Exon Amendment, titled the "Communications 
Decency Act of 1995," which has been attached to the telecommunications bill. 
While I believe that Senator Exon had the best of intentions in proposing this 
legislation which was intended to protect children from pornographic images 
available on the Internet, the bill has been perverted in an attempt to 
placate online service companies and others. I am confident that in its 
current form the bill is opposed by substantially all pro-family groups in 
America.

Prior to my current position, I served as section chief of the Child 
Exploitation and Obscenity Section in the Criminal Division in the US 
Department of Justice, the office responsible for prosecuting violators 
of obscenity and child pornography laws. I am familiar with the current 
state of law regarding prohibitions on computer pornography. I my opinion 
the current federal dial-a-porn law (which the Exon bill amends) already
prohibits commercial distribution of obscenity via computers. It is 
also my opinion (although this point is not as clear in the law as the 
first) that federal criminal, specifically Title 18, sections 1462 and 
1465 prohibit distribution of obscenity via computer whether or not for 
commercial purpose. The only purpose of additional legislation in this 
area, therefore, should be to clarify current law and perhaps strengthen 
penalties. It was my understanding that this was the original intention
of Senator Exon. Now, however, the Exon bill weakens the federal 
dial-a-porn law. The following represents my particular objections to 
the most egregious parts of the bill:

1. The bill provides numerous defenses to prosecution to those companies 
   which provide access to the Internet which are necessary because such 
   companies are not liable unless they knowingly aid in the commission of 
   a violation. If they are knowingly participating in a violation, then 
   they _should_ be subject to the law, and congress should not provide a 
   defense to protect them.

2. The bill provides an additional defense for those who knowingly transmit 
   obscenity of indecency but are not engaged in a commercial activity, the 
   predominant purpose of which is the transmission of obscenity or indecency. 
   Under this provision, the burden would be on the prosecutor to demonstrate 
   that the predominant commercial activity of the defendant is the transmission 
   of obscenity and indecency. This is too great a burden for the prosecutor and 
   is entirely unique in law.

3. The bill includes a pre-emption clause which may limit states from 
   providing greater protections to children than the Exon bill.

4. The scienter or knowledge requirement contained in the bill is entirely 
   unreasonable. The bill requires that the defendant had "actual knowledge of 
   the specific content" of the material. It would be impossible for a prosecutor
   to demonstrate that the defendant had the requisite knowledge in most every case.
   The current knowledge requirement in obscenity cases is that the prosecutor must
   show that the defendant knew or had reason to know of the _general nature and 
   character of the work_.

While I have other objections to the bill, the above states my objections to 
provisions which would weaken current federal law regarding the prosecution of 
illegal pornography.

I have met with Senator Exon and several members of his staff who are working
on this bill. I am certain that the Senator is genuinely trying to provide 
effective legislation in this important area.  Perhaps before the 
telecommunications legislation reaches the floor he will propose amendments
which will remove objectionable portions of the bill. If not, I hope you will 
do what you can to amend the telecommunications bill to remove the Exon 
provisions.

Most Sincerely,

<title>Administration Concerns on S.652</title>
<body>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>ADMINISTRATION CONCERNS REGARDING S. 652: 
THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION
AND DEREGULATION ACT OF 1995</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<P>

<I>Chick <a href ="#first.amdt">here</a> to skip directly to concerns about the Communicaitons Decency Act amendments.</I>

<H3>I. Introduction</H3>
<P>
The Administration takes this opportunity to comment upon S. 652, the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995, as reported by the Senate Commerce Committee.
<P>
The Administration believes that the key test for any telecommunications reform measure is whether it helps the American people. Legislation should provide benefits to consumers, spur economic growth and innovation, promote private sector investment in an advanced telecommunications infrastructure, and create jobs. However, unleashing monopolies before real competition exists could cause higher prices for consumers and hinder competition. During the transition, safeguards are needed to bring real competition and all its benefits.
<P>

While significant portions of the bill are consistent with these principles, in critical respects the bill does too little to promote competition and too little to ensure that consumers are not hurt by monopolistic behavior. The Administration urges the Senate to amend the legislation to ensure a truly competitive telecommunications marketplace by addressing our major concerns with the bill as currently drafted before Senate passage.
<P>

<H3>II. Cable Rate Regulation</H3>
<P>

The Administration is particularly concerned about provisions in the Senate bill that could: (1) substantially reduce Federal Communications Commission (FCC) oversight of the rates for "cable programming services" charged by cable systems not subject to effective competition; and (2) significantly loosen the 1992 Cable Act's definition of "effective competition." While some relief may be appropriate for small and rural cable systems, the broader changes that the bill would make could potentially have serious adverse affects for cable subscribers. 
<P>

<B>Reduced Regulation of Cable Programming Services:</B> Section 204 of the bill would preclude FCC scrutiny of a rate for cable programming services (commonly known as "expanded basic services") unless that rate "substantially exceeds the national average rate for comparable cable programming services." This provision could result in cable rates increases for a large number of consumers. In addition, consumers of basic service could see many services moved to the less regulated upper tiers. The provision could also permit cable systems to escape regulation through concerted increases in their expanded basic service rates. Every rate increase by an individual cable system would raise the nationwide average rate for expanded basic services and, therefore, pave the way for subsequent rate increases not only by that system but every other cable system.
<P>

<B>Redefinition of "Effective Competition":</B> Section 204 of the Senate bill also would amend the Cable Act to declare that a cable system faces "effective competition" if a local exchange carrier (LEC) "offers video programming services directly to subscribers" within the system's franchise area, whether over a common carrier video platform or as a conventional cable operator. This provision appears to deregulate upon the merest potential of competition from the LECs, without regard to whether or not such competition really exists on any significant scale. If there are legitimate concerns that the current multichannel competitor test for "effective competition" is too stringent, that provision should be changed in a way that still takes actual subscribership to competing services into account. 
<P>

<H3>III. Telco/Cable Provisions</H3>
<P>

Although the Administration strongly supports the bill's repeal of the telco/cable crossownership restriction, we are nonetheless concerned about the associated provisions that would: (1) permit mergers and joint ventures between telephone companies (telcos) and cable systems in the telcos' local service areas; (2) give telcos the option of providing video programming either via a common carrier video platform or as a conventional cable system; and 3) not require a separate subsidiary for video programming services.
<P>

<B>Absence of an Anti-Buyout Restriction:</B> The Senate bill would allow telephone companies to buy out local cable companies in the telco's local service area. While telcos and cable systems are potential competitors in the video services market, technological change and aggressive plant modernization have positioned cable operators to become viable providers of local telephone service as well. Permitting widespread mergers between telcos and cable systems, therefore, could undermine this potential competition in both the video and telephony markets before it begins, potentially raising telephone and cable prices paid by consumers. This movement to a "one-wire world" potentially would leave antitrust litigation as the only barrier to anti-competitive behavior.
<P>

For this reason, the Administration has consistently advocated a strong ban on acquisitions and joint ventures between telcos and cable systems in the telcos' local service area, subject to a limited exception in rural areas and authority for the FCC to review the ban after a certain number of years.
<P>

<B>Optional Provision of a Common Carrier Video Platform:</B> The Senate bill would allow telcos to provide video programming services either on a common carrier video dialtone (VDT) basis or as a conventional cable operator. The Administration is concerned that, in the latter case, telcos would not be required to provide common carrier VDT facilities to unaffiliated programmers. A common carrier VDT platform cannot be merely an option for telcos, but rather should be a required aspect of their entry into the video programming market. As long as telcos continue to control the poles and conduits that cable companies need to provide service, and as long as telcos remain regulated and dominant providers of local telephone service, there is a substantial risk that telcos may be able to gain an unwarranted competitive advantage in the video services market through discrimination and cross-subsidization. Requiring telcos to provide common carrier VDT facilities to unaffiliated programmers would ensure that programmers have ample opportunities to market services directly to subscribers, without having to go through a conduit- controlling gatekeeper. This would foster additional competition in the provision of video to the home, with the concomitant benefits of lower prices, more programming choices, and improved customer service.
<P>

<B>Separate Subsidiaries for Video Programming:</B> The bill as currently drafted does not require that the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) establish a separate subsidiary for video programming provided on a common carrier basis, but instead relies on the BOCs not to cross subsidize between the provision of video programming and telecommunications services. Structural separation would be a better approach to ensure detection of such cross- subsidies.
<P>

<H3>IV. Local Competition/Interconnection Requirements</H3>
<P>

The Administration is concerned that the provisions for interconnection may not set the stage for effective local competition. With respect to both procedure and substance, 
the bill does not do enough to ensure that opportunities for 
local competition will be available to all in a rapid timeframe. 
<P>

<B>Application of Interconnection Requirements:</B> With respect to interconnection, the bill defines the relevant market -- for identifying an entity with market power subject to the interconnection requirements -- to include all providers of local telephone service, regardless of the technology applied. As a result, wireless services would be included, even if the price disparity between the two technologies ensured that they did not compete for the same customers. It would also include every provider of service to discrete customer niches, even if that provider offers no competition whatsoever for the vast majority of customers. This is contrary to accepted principles of market definition, as embodied in the 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. The bill's market definition, therefore, could seriously understate the market share of an incumbent LEC, and result in a failure to apply interconnection duties to a carrier that does, in fact, possess market power. 
<P>

<B>Interconnection Agreement via Negotiation:</B> In allowing carriers to fulfill their duty to interconnect by negotiating agreements with other carriers, the bill does not ensure timely interconnection for competitors. Since these negotiated agreements need not satisfy the list of minimum standards outlined in section 251(b), and since a State has very limited power to reject a negotiated agreement, a BOC monopolist may be able to make use of its vastly superior bargaining power, particularly since a sole negotiated agreement may serve as a BOC ticket into the long distance market in a given area. The strongest competitors, therefore, may be the last to obtain interconnection agreements.
<P>

<B>Limits on Resale:</B> The bill's provisions on resale would allow a State to limit the resale of subsidized universal service, allowing a company to sell services to other carriers based on actual cost, exclusive of universal service support. This would apparently be allowed even if the first carrier keeps the revenues that provide such universal service support, enabling a carrier to collect its cost twice -- once from the carrier that purchases service for resale, and once from the source of universal service support. This provision should therefore be modified to prevent such "double" collection.
<P>

<B>Waivers for Local Carriers:</B> Under certain conditions, the FCC or a State may waive or modify the minimum interconnection standards laid out in Section 251. There is a problem, however, in how the bill defines carriers eligible for such a waiver -- those "with fewer than 2% of the Nation's subscriber lines installed in the aggregate nationwide." The Administration believes that the 2% figure is too large because, except for most of the BOCs and GTE, almost every other provider of local exchange service in the United States would potentially be eligible for an exemption from the interconnection requirements of Section 251. 
<P>

<B>Rural Issues:</B> The bill mandates that for interexchange carriers which serve both rural and urban areas, rates must be no more expensive in rural areas than in urban areas. This may have several adverse effects on competition: 1) it may discourage urban providers from expanding into rural areas, limiting customer choice in those areas; and 2) providers that are already in rural and urban areas will be unable to lower urban rates to competitive levels because they are tied to the same rate changes in the rural areas. This provision may thus actually contribute to higher urban rates instead of lower rural rates.
<P>

Also, Section 309 of the Committee bill would permit States to restrict competitive entry in rural areas, unless new entrants agree to serve an area comparable to the incumbent's on similar terms and conditions. Such a provision could severely hamper the growth of competition and the resulting consumer benefits. The Administration shares the Committee's concern that competition be encouraged in a way that does not cause dislocations for consumers, wherever they reside. We believe, however, that the best way to address this concern is not by restricting competition, but by adopting universal service policies, on a competitively neutral basis, to protect those relatively few consumers that may not fully benefit from competition. 
<P>

<B>The Potential for Price Squeezes:</B> The bill provides little protection against price squeezes by the BOCs, which could significantly damage both local and long distance competition. While a BOC subsidiary would be required to "pay" or impute the cost of inputs obtained from its parent company, the nominal amount it pays for these inputs is relatively unimportant, since it is really just a transfer payment from one part of the company to another. Thus the BOC parent could inflate its rates for local service inputs without causing any real harm to its long distance affiliate. For competitors, however, such inflation could be devastating. They would have to pay the BOC the inflated prices for local service inputs, but they would be unable to match the competitive retail rates offered by such a BOC, since its costs are recovered elsewhere in the company. In this way a BOC would have the capability to drive any competitors from the market.
V. MFJ/Long-Distance Relief
<P>

The Administration believes that the bill may allow the BOCs to enter the long distance market before there are real opportunities for local competition and under circumstances where entry might impede competition in adjacent and more competitive markets. This could endanger competition and could represent a lost opportunity to create appropriate incentives to open monopolized markets. As currently drafted, the bill relies on one principal safeguard -- the public interest test as administered by the FCC; the Department of Justice has no decision-making role to apply its unwavering focus and expertise to facilitate the vital transition from monopoly to competition. 
<P>

<B>Long-Distance Entry:</B> The provisions in the Senate bill on long distance entry may allow BOC entry before real competitive opportunities exist in a given local market. To obtain relief, a BOC need not enter into interconnection arrangements with all, or even several, of its potential competitors, and it need not reach agreement with any significant competitor. It must show only that it has entered into an interconnection agreement that satisfies the "competitive checklist" in the bill. A BOC could negotiate an agreement with one weak competitor that satisfied the "competitive checklist," thereby obtaining long distance entry a year or more before it enters into an interconnection agreement with any serious competitor. It is not required to show that real competitive opportunities or actual competition exits.
<P>

While the bill moves toward requiring the BOCs to fulfill both the important minimum interconnection requirements set forth in section 251 and the partially overlapping requirements of the "competitive checklist" (section 255) in order to obtain long distance relief, BOC entry could occur without satisfying the minimum interconnection requirements of section 251. Section 251(c) allows negotiation of interconnection agreements which do not satisfy the minimum interconnection standards of section 251(b). Thus, the BOC could obtain long distance entry without agreeing to interconnect at any technically feasible point in the network, and without agreeing to provide nondiscriminatory access to facilities and information necessary for interoperability of the networks. 
<P>

<B>Department of Justice Role:</B> Throughout this century, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has played a major role in promoting telecommunications competition. Particularly in the last 25 years, the Department has developed, through investigation, litigation and oversight of the AT&T divestiture, deep knowledge and expertise in the area. This has been reinforced by the Department's investigations with respect to telecommunications mergers and other matters. Given the Antitrust Division's expertise, the Department of Justice should be assigned a decision-making role in the process, rather than the consulting role that the bill currently dictates. The Department should be required to assess market facts and determine that entry could indeed promote competition without endangering the progress already achieved in enabling adjacent markets to become competitive. This entry test could be applied at the same time and by the same date as the FCC's more broadly focused entry test so as to ensure no delay.
<P>

<B>Immediate Out-of-Region Entry:</B> Out-of-region service is not defined in the bill; it is unclear whether long distance service that originates out-of-region but terminates in-region would be permitted. If service that terminates in-region is included in the definition, then there should be a separate subsidiary and other requirements to guard against discrimination, especially since the BOCs are permitted to provide out-of-region service before implementing unbundling and interconnection. Also, some services may technically originate out-of-region but are more appropriately considered as in-region services. 
<P>

<B>Extending the Competitive Checklist:</B> The bill prevents the FCC from extending the terms of the competitive checklist. This could pose a serious problem if it means that the FCC must consider the checklist satisfied even if, for example, the prices at which unbundled network elements would be offered would not permit competition. A niche carrier could accede to high prices in order to reach a negotiated settlement and avoid protracted arbitration or intervention, yet the resulting competitive conditions might not be at all conducive to general competition throughout the area in which the BOC wished to provide interLATA service.
<P>

<B>Equal Access for Wireless Carriers:</B> The bill's elimination of equal access requirements for wireless carriers would result in severe harm to competition. The bill would call into question the recent AT&T McCaw settlement with DOJ, which demanded equal access in the merger of AT&T and McCaw to avoid anticompetitive effects in the cellular and interexchange markets. These protections were intended to prevent AT&T, which has a very large market share for cellular interexchange service, from obtaining exclusive control over McCaw's cellular customers. The bill would also undo the DOJ's proposal regarding equal access requirements for the BOCs if they are permitted to enter the interexchange market from their cellular operations. 
<P>

<H3>VI. Preemption</H3>
<P>

The Administration believes that the bill should not halt or roll back state efforts to open telecommunications markets to competition. As currently drafted, however, the bill does just that in important respects. In certain markets, the bill would extend or preserve the BOCs' local monopolies, delaying competition in these monopolized markets until the BOCs enter the long distance market -- a market which already provides consumers with some of the benefits of competition. The Administration also believes that the federal government should not dictate to the states which form of telephone rate regulation is best to protect state consumers under the different circumstances and levels of competition that will develop in each state. 
<P>

<B>Rate Regulation:</B> The Administration believes that price caps, or similar forms of incentive regulation, may often be superior to conventional rate-of-return regulation. The FCC and the States should have the flexibility to explore which forms of regulation would best serve consumers in markets that are not yet fully competitive. States in particular have been innovative in introducing competition into the marketplace, while at the same time protecting consumers, improving incentives for efficiency, and encouraging the most effective deployment of the information highway. Almost half of the States already use alternatives to rate-of-return regulation. The Administration therefore opposes the provision in the bill that would deprive the FCC and the States of this flexibility.
<P>

<B>IntraLATA Dialing Parity:</B> The Senate bill bars States from ordering intraLATA dialing parity until the resident BOC has obtained long distance relief. This provision could curtail competition in significant intraLATA toll markets now monopolized or dominated by BOCs because several progressive States (such as Minnesota, Michigan and New York) are enhancing or are about to enhance competition in these markets by requiring implementation of dialing parity. By preempting State prerogatives, the bill would: 1) extend monopoly control over these intraLATA toll call markets, which would hurt consumers; 2) diminish rather than increase the monopolists' incentives to open their markets to competition as rapidly as possible; and 3) put significant pressure on the FCC to approve BOC interLATA applications regardless of other market conditions.
<P>

<B>Joint Marketing:</B> The bill bars most BOC competitors from marketing long distance services together with resold local service until the BOCs are permitted to offer long distance service in-region. This may deter some competitors from engaging in resale competition at all, and those who choose to compete may charge higher prices to consumers as a result. Several companies have been providing such service for years to small and mid-size business customers; this will hurt those providers and their customers. The provision also could diminish the monopolists' incentives to interconnect their local monopolies as quickly as possible and may delay, until after long distance entry, resolution of the considerable problems which may be involved in reselling the BOCs' local service. The provision would impede the efforts of many States to encourage "one-stop shopping," and raises the probability that the FCC will be under pressure to find the public interest test satisfied regardless of market conditions. Finally, the bill imposes upon companies lacking monopoly power in any telephone market all of the costs and inefficiencies of separate marketing, with no corresponding benefit to consumers. 
<P>

<B>Bars Court Review of State PUC Interconnection Decisions:</B> The bill bars State court review of PUC interconnection agreements. While this may speed the process, it vests tremendous power in State agencies that may be understaffed and may lack the resources necessary to make the many decisions required by the bill. Moreover, it is unclear whether the bill permits FCC review in place of court review, in what circumstances this might occur, and whether FCC decisions would, in turn, be reviewable. 
<P>

<H3>VII. Foreign Ownership</H3>
<P>

The current legislation fails to specify the Executive Branch's role in determining whether Section 310(b) foreign ownership restrictions should be lifted for a particular country. The Administration feels strongly that the legislation should explicitly take into account the Executive Branch's broad statutory authority and expertise for matters relating to U.S. trade, foreign relations, foreign investments, antitrust policy, and national security by ensuring that the FCC takes notice of and accords deference to the policy determinations of the Executive Branch when making its Section 310(b) determinations. 
<P>

The legislation should also provide flexibility for the U.S. government to consider, consistent with international obligations, all competitive conditions in foreign markets. The current legislation is too restrictive and should be revised to allow the Executive Branch, in advising the FCC on Section 310(b) matters, to look at the ability of U.S.- owned carriers to supply telecommunications services in all market segments in the foreign country and should include a national interest exception. The Executive Branch also needs flexibility to continue its ongoing bilateral and multilateral consultations and negotiations to open overseas telecommunications services markets. Therefore, the legislation's "snapback" provision, which presents a unilateral threat to remove negotiated benefits, should be deleted. In addition, the bill should make clear that any authority provided by the legislation be exercised in a manner consistent with international obligations, including most favored nation commitments.
<P>

<H3>VIII.	Broadcasting</H3>
<P>

The Administration is concerned that the Senate bill would allow greater concentration in the broadcast industry and less rigorous and timely oversight of broadcast licensees by the FCC. The provisions relaxing limits on local and national ownership concentration and limiting license review could impede competition and diversity of voices by enabling existing owners to concentrate control over expanding broadcast capacity.
<P>

<B>Media Concentration:</B>The Senate bill would allow for greater concentration in the broadcast industry, and in the media industry generally, by increasing from 25 to 35 percent the national audience one broadcast owner can reach, and by removing the broadcast-cable crossownership ban. The result could be greatly expanded media concentration at the national and local levels. Such changes should be considered by the FCC in the context of the coming expansion of broadcast capacity through digital television. The uncertain impact of the move to digital compression and other technological advances argue for delaying any changes in the multiple or local ownership rules pending further study.
<P>

<B>License Terms Extension:</B> The Administration is concerned that the Senate bill extends the term from five to ten years for television licenses and from seven to ten years for radio licenses. The bill also removes the opportunity for "comparative review" at the end of a license term. These provisions seriously weaken the FCC's ability to enforce a broadcaster's obligation to provide service in the public interest. In particular, the provisions deprive the FCC of its traditional authority to consider applications from competing entities who argue that they will do a better job of serving the public. 
<P>

<B>Broadcast Flexibility:</B> The Administration generally agrees with the concept of providing broadcasters greater spectrum flexibility although there are a number of issues to be considered. For example, if the FCC awards a second channel to existing broadcasters for development of advanced television service, the Senate bill should require the broadcasters to surrender one of their two licenses at the end of an appropriate transition period. 
<P>

<H3><a name ="first.amdt">IX. First Amendment and Law Enforcement Issues</a></H3>
<P>

The Administration shares the Committee's goal of preventing obscenity from being widely transmitted over networks. However, the legislation raises complex policy issues that merit close examination prior to Congressional action. These include the impact of additional regulation on the development of the National Information Infrastructure, the ability of industry to develop technological solutions to the problems the legislation is intended to address, the effect on First Amendment and privacy considerations, and the increasingly global nature of the infrastructure. The piecemeal approach taken in this legislation is inadvisable. Instead, a comprehensive review should be undertaken, including Congressional hearings. 
<P>

By criminalizing the transmission of material outside the scope of the legal definition of "obscenity," the Amendment will be subject to First Amendment challenge. Moreover, the Amendment creates certain new defenses to prosecution that will hamper the ability of the Justice Department to prosecute computer obscenity under current statutes. For instance, it could expose to prosecution online service providers who make a good faith effort to keep their systems free from pornography, while providing immunity to providers who knowingly carry pornography, but make no effort to exercise editorial control. 
<P>

Section 5 of the Amendment is unnecessary and could have unintended consequences. In particular, the addition of a new, undefined category of "digital" communications to the wiretap statute would only cause confusion. In fact, digital communications are already covered by the statute. In addition, the section could have an unintended effect on the standard of criminal liability, reaching into communications not now covered because they do not evince a reasonable expectation of privacy. This standard is in itself shifting in the face of a continual erosion of that expectation caused by emerging technologies. However, this statute is not the place to raise or deal with this complex issue, and the Section would only foster confusion and unnecessary litigation.
<P>

<H3>X. Universal Service Issues</H3>
<P>

One of the main principles of the Administration's National Information Infrastructure initiative is to preserve and advance universal service to avoid creating a society of information "haves" and "have nots." For this reason, the Administration supports the goal of universal service, including access for classrooms, libraries, hospitals, and clinics to the National Information Infrastructure, including in rural areas. Congress should also consider adding appropriate language to the bill that would prevent "redlining" in the provision of telecommunications and information services.

<H2>Why Should I Care About The Cryptography Policy Debate?</H2>

Cryptography products are the locks and keys of the Information Age, enabling individuals and businesses to protect sensitive information as it is transmitted over the Internet.  The ability to protect and secure information is vital to the growth of electronic commerce and to the growth of the Internet itself.
<P>
Current encryption policy prohibits US companies from selling strong
encryption products on the world market.  As a result, very few strong,
easy to use, privacy and security tools are available to Internet users,
and your personal communications and financial transactions are left
vulnerable to the prying eyes of hackers, foreign governments, and - yes - even rogue law enforcement agents. Worse yet, the Clinton Administration
continues to push unworkable key-escrow policies such as the Clipper and
Clipper II proposals.
<P>
Until the cryptography policy debate is resolved, privacy and security on
the Internet remain hostage to outdated, Cold War-era regulations that
threaten privacy and security online.
<P>

<H2>Circuit Court Hears Challenge to Crypto Regulations</H2>
<FONT SIZE=-1>First Posted on January 9, 1997</FONT>
<P>
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit hears oral arguments Friday (Jan. 10) in a challenge to the encryption export control regulations. Plaintiff Phil Karn is arguing that the encryption licensing scheme -- which prohibits his export of encryption source code on a disk, but allows the export of identical source code when printed -- is an unconstitutional prior
restraint on free speech and is unlawfully arbitrary and capricious as applied. <P>

This is the first encryption challenge to be heard at the Circuit Court level. It comes on the heels of <A HREF="961218_Bernstein_ruling.html">a California federal court ruling</A> in a similar case that export controls <I>are</I> an unconstitutional prior restraint.

<B>Commerce Department Issues New Crypto Regs, Maintains Export Controls on
Strong Encryption</B> <FONT SIZE=-1>[Updated January 9, 1997]</FONT><P>

The Administration has released regulations that continue export
controls on strong encryption while shifting those controls to the Commerce
Department. The new rules would permit export of moderately stronger 56-bit
encryption systems -- but for the next two years only, and only by
companies that make &quot;satisfactory commitments&quot; to develop and market &quot;key
recovery&quot; products.   The rules also provide a first look at detailed new

On December 2, the <A HREF="http://www.bsa.org/" TARGET="NEW">Business Software Alliance</A>, a Washington, D.C.-based trade organization of software manufacturers, sent a letter to Vice President Gore raising questions about the implementation of the Administration's new encryption proposal.<P>

In the letter, BSA President Robert Holleyman warns the Vice President that unless the Administration &quot;radically changes its approach immediately, ... the new policy is destined to fail just like its predecessor Clipper efforts.&quot;

On Tuesday October 1, the Clinton Administration announced its plan to ease export controls on strong encryption.  Technology companies would be able to export products that use 56-bit encryption for the next two years - contingent on the companies' promise to distribute &quot;key recovery&quot; products after that two-year period.

A Federal judge in San Francisco has issued an opinion in Dan Bernstein's challenge to U.S.
encryption laws, invalidating export control provisions on encryption source code as an

<A NAME="intro"></A>

<H3>Background on Pro-CODE</H3>

In a move to replace the Cold War-era regulations on encryption with
policies that make sense for the global Internet, Senators Conrad Burns (R-MT),
Bob Dole (R-KS), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Larry Pressler (R-SD), Ron Wyden
(D-OR), Patty Murray (D-WA), and others 
introduced legislation on May 2, 1996 to roll back the restrictions prohibiting the export
of strong encryption technology. 
<P>
The bill, entitled the "Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era
(Pro-CODE) Act of 1996", was designed to encourage the widespread
availability of strong, easy-to-use privacy and security technologies for
the Internet. It was similar to a bill introduced in March by Senators Leahy
and Burns, though the new bill did not contain criminal provisions or
provisions imposing liability for third party key holders.
<P>
The Senate Commerce Committee vote on the bill that was scheduled for Thursday September 12 was postponed indefinitely.

<B>Commerce Department Issues New Crypto Regs, Maintains Export Controls on

The Administration has released regulations that continue export
controls on strong encryption while shifting those controls to the Commerce
Department. The new rules would permit export of moderately stronger 56-bit
encryption systems -- but for the next two years only, and only by
companies that make &quot;satisfactory commitments&quot; to develop and market &quot;key
recovery&quot; products.   The rules also provide a first look at detailed new
regulations and criteria for government-approved exportable key recovery
systems.<P>

The new rules take effect immediately; however, comments on the new Commerce Department regulations may be submitted to the Department until February 13.

<h3>Clinton Administration Continues to Push For Flawed Crypto Export Policy</h3>
<p>
The Clinton Administration has continued to push its latest key escrow cryptography export proposal, despite a chorus of disapproval from civil liberties advocates and the computer and communications industry. At a public meeting at the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) on December 5, 1995, Administration officials presented a <A HREF="http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/keyescrow/criteria.txt">revised version of their proposed Key Escrow Export Criteria</A> (initially proposed in September 1995). The proposal keeps in place the current export ban on strong cryptography, and allows for the export of moderately stronger (64-bit key length) systems meeting strict key escrow criteria.
<p>
The proposal was roundly criticized by civil liberties organization, companies, and individuals at the December 5, 1995 meeting on the grounds that it would create a barrier to security and privacy on the Net. It is expected that the Administration will soon move forward to formally adopt the proposal as part of its current export criteria for cryptography.

<H2>National Research Council Report Calls Administration Crypto Policy into  Question</h2>
<FONT SIZE=-1>First Posted on May 31, 1996 || Last Updated on June 10, 1996</FONT>
<P>
On Thursday May 30, the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) of the National Research Council (NRC) released its comprehensive report on the state of U.S. encryption policy.  The report, "Cryptography's Role in Securing the Information Society," not only highlights the need for strong, reliable encryption, it calls the Administration's current cryptography policy in question.
<P>
Among other things, the report describes how the current US encryption
policy is not working, notes that classified information is not relevant to
the policy debate, and outlines the adverse impact export restrictions have
had on the domestic market.  In addition, the study emphasizes that market
forces and user choices, not law enforcement or national security
interests, should drive the development of encryption technologies and the
debate over US cryptography policy.

<h3>Encryption Experts Call For Much Longer Key Lengths</h3>
<p>
Seven leading experts on cryptography have released a joint report arguing that dramatically stronger encryption is needed to provide adequate privacy and security for computer users. The study calls for the deployment of 75- to 90-bit key length encryption systems, in contrast to the 40-bit systems currently exportable under Administration policies.
<p>
The report, <a href = "http://www.bsa.org/bsa/cryptologists.html">"Minimal Key Lengths for Symmetric Ciphers to Provide Adequate Commercial Security"</a> was written by cryptography and computer security experts Matt Blaze, Whitfield Diffie, Ronald Rivest, Bruce Schnier, Tsutomo Shimomura, Eric Thompson, and Michael Weiner.
<p>
The study joins the mounting body of evidence showing that products exportable under the Clinton Administration's encryption policies do not provide adequate privacy and security.  The report argues that computer products with 40-bit encryption keys "offer virtually no protection at this point" from brute force attacks. "To provide adequate protection against the most serious threats... keys used to protect data today should be at least 75 bits long. To protect information adequately for the next 20 years .... keys in newly-deployed systems should be at least 90 bits long."  <font size = -1>Feb. 1996</font>

<P>
On February 3-4 and February 18-19, the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) Subcommittee on Privacy and Confidentiality will hold public hearings to discuss the various options for implementing health information privacy standards.   The subcommittee is holding these hearings so it may develop recommendations to give to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in preparation for an HHS report to Congress regarding privacy standards of individually identifiable health information.  This report is required by the <A HREF="/publications/pp_2.30.html">&quot;Administrative Simplification&quot;</A> subtitle of the &quot;Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996&quot; (Pub. L. 104-191, Section 264).
<P>
Issues covered at the hearing will include the full range of fair information practices, patient rights, limitations on use and disclosure of identifiable information, health identification number, preemption of state laws, and privacy-enhancing technology.
<P>
The hearings will be held on February 3-4 and February 18-19 from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. at the Hubert H. Humphrey Building (200 Independence Avenue, SW), Room 503A, Washington, D.C.  The hearings are open to the public, but seating is limited.  The public is also invited to send written comments to the subcommittee.  All comments to the subcommittee must be received by February 19th.<BR>

<P>
While S. 1360 (the Bennett-Leahy bill) remains in limbo,
Congress did take some action that impacts medical records privacy before they began the summer recess.  The 
recently-passed Kennedy-Kassebaum Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HR 3103) contains a section known as 
&quot;Administrative Simplification.&quot;  This section of the Act mandates the
development and adoption of standards for electronic exchanges of health 
information.  It also mandates that Congress or the Secretary of Health and
Human Services develop privacy rules to govern such electronic 
exchanges; however, these rules may not be in place before the electronic 
system is implemented.

On June 13, the U.S. Supreme Court held in a 7-2 decision that notes of conversations taken
during sessions between a patient and a social worker/therapist are
protected from compelled disclosure in court. In Jaffee v. Redmond, the
Court recognized that preserving the privilege of confidentiality in the
relationship between a therapists and patients is critical to developing
trust and thus ensuring successful treatment. Given the recent trend toward computerization of medical information, including medical health records, CDT hails the Jaffee decision as a great step in protecting the privacy of those records.

<BIG><STRONG>Mark-up of Medical Privacy Bill Postponed Indefinitely.</STRONG></BIG> <font size = -1>[May 13, 1996]</font>
<P>
The mark-up of The Medical Records Confidentiality Act (S.1360), originally scheduled for April 24, has been postponed indefinitely by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. The Committee has delayed action on S.1360 (also known as the Bennett-Leahy bill after its chief sponsors) to give the pharmaceutical industry and health data companies an opportunity to express their concerns about the privacy provisions in the bill. Following recommendations from CDT and other privacy and consumer groups seeking to strengthen the bill, a new version of S.1360 was drafted by Senators Nancy Kassebaum (R-KA) and Edward Kennedy (D-MA).  The new version was released April 10. (See <a href = "/publications/pp_2.14.html">CDT Policy Post 2.14 - April 12, 1996.</a>)
 <p>
CDT opposes any weakening of the current version of S.1360.  CDT has sent a letter of support for the Bennett-Leahy bill to Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy.  The letter was signed by a wide variety of consumer, privacy and patient advocates, as well as health care providers, researchers, employers, and information technology companies.

<p>
On April 24, 1996, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee will consider S. 1360, the "Medical Records Confidentiality Act".  A recently strengthened S. 1360 would create strong, comprehensive privacy safeguards for the health data of all Americans.  CDT supports the Bennett-Leahy bill and believes that its enactment would create strong, enforceable privacy protections where few currently exist.
<p>
When the bill was first introduced in October 1995, some in the privacy policy community argued that the bill did not go far enough.  CDT, along with other public interest advocates and consumer groups, recommended changes to the bill to strengthen the proposal and ensure that individuals are better able to control access to and disclosure of their private health records.  The revised bill, rewritten by Senators Nancy Kassebaum (R-KA) and Edward Kennedy (D-MA), incorporates many of the key changes recommended by CDT, the CDT-led coalition, and others in the public interest community, including Public Citizen and EPIC.

(1) END OF SESSION WRAP-UP OF ONLINE PRIVACY ISSUES

With Congress adjourned and the campaign season behind us, we have a chance 
to step back and look at online privacy issues.  While there were some
disappointments during the year, there were also signs of progress.  The 
issue of personal privacy itself was consistently on the public radar screen
over the past year.  The media's spotlight is increasingly focused on
information privacy.  CDT's privacy demonstration site continues to receive 
over 1000 hits a day, and a number or recent studies indicate growing public
concern with the loss of privacy.

Numerous federal agencies have launched privacy intiatives focused on the 
impact of new technologies.  Several members of Congress introduced 
legislation on privacy issues ranging from the protection of medical 
information, to the development of privacy-enhancing technology.  The 
Administration appears poised to create a yet-to-be-defined "privacy 
entity" that would, at least, coordinate the Administrations' privacy 
efforts or, at best, advocate on behalf of individual privacy.

In addition, there has been some market response to public outcries over the
loss of personal privacy --- forcing one company to revise a product and a
number of other companies to step forward with a policy to provide consumers
with a bit more control over their personal information.  

Progress made in protecting personal privacy:

*  LEGISLATION:  Provisions in three recently passed laws begin to address
   privacy concerns in personal information regarding individuals' telephone 
   usage, individuals personal health information, and personal information 
   held by credit bureaus.   

        CUSTOMER PROPRIETARY NETWORK INFORMATION (CPNI):  A relatively
     unknown part of the recently enacted Telecommunications Reform Act of
     1995 is a win for personal privacy.  The CPNI provisions limits the 
     use and disclosure of CPNI -- information which relates to the 
     quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, and amount of use
     of a telecommunications service by a customer and is available to the 
     carrier solely by virtue of the carrier-customer relationship -- to the 
     telecommunications service for which the information was collected or 
     for other services that are necessary to or used in the provision of 
     that service.  The law also provides individuals a legal right to access
     their own CPNI. 
        The CPNI provisions are an important step forward in recognizing
     an individual privacy interest in transactional information.  Similar to
     the provisions regulating law enforcement access to transactional data 
     under the Digital Telephony Bill (CALEA), the CPNI provisions recognize 
     that individuals have a privacy interest in transactional data, akin to 
     the privacy interest in the actual contents of their communications.  In
     addition, the CPNI rules set an important precedent by regulating the 
     private sectors use of transactional information.  The Federal 
     Communications Commission (FCC) issued a proposed rule in June, 1996 and 
     received comments.  The final rule on the implementation of this 
     provision should be issued shortly.  

        HEALTH INFORMATION:  The recently-passed Kennedy-Kassebaum "Health 
     Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996" included the first
     guarantee of a federal policy to govern the privacy of health 
     information in electronic form.  While provisions of the Act mandating 
     the speedy development and adoption of standards for electronic 
     exchanges of health information are troublesome given the lack of 
     strong, enforceable laws protecting patient privacy, the law contains a
     mandate that privacy rules be enacted by either the Congress or the 
     Executive Branch within the next four years. 

        CREDIT INFORMATION:  The public outcry over the sale of personal 
     information by Lexis-Nexis's P-Trak service prompted Congress to request
     a Federal Reserve Board study examining the risk of fraud raised by the 
     disclosure of personal information.  In addition, the P-Trak furor may 
     have played a roll in nixing an industry-backed exemption to the Fair 
     Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) which would have allowed credit reports to 
     be used to generate target marketing lists.  This type of credit report 
     use is currently against FTC rules interpreting the FCRA.

   Privacy-related bills introduced during the 104th Congress:

        HEALTH INFORMATION:  Late last year, Sen. Robert Bennett (R-UT) and
     Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced S. 1360, the "Medical Records 
     Confidentiality Act".  A complimentary bill was introduced by Rep. Jim 
     McDermott (D-WA), the "Medical Privacy in the Age of New Technologies 
     Act".

        ONLINE PRIVACY:  This past June, Congressman Ed Markey (D-MA)
     introduced the "Communications Privacy and Consumer Empowerment Act".  
     This bill was designed to address concerns over the collection and use 
     of personal information generated and collected online.  Late in the 
     session, Rep. Bruce Vento introduced "The Consumer Internet Privacy 
     Protection Act of 1996", also aimed at protecting the privacy of 
     information collected and generated during online activities. 

        CHILDREN'S PRIVACY:  A hearing was held on Rep. Bob Frank's bill, 
     "The Children's Privacy Protection and Parental Empowerment Act of 
     1996."  As noted by CDT, People For the American Way, the Electronic 
     Frontier Foundation, and Voters Telecommunications Watch, the CPPPEA 
     raises a number of privacy and First Amendment problems for the 
     Internet.  

*  GOV'T AGENCIES FOCUS ON PRIVACY:  Federal agencies, such as the Federal 
   Trade Commission (FTC) and the NTIA (National Telecommunications and 
   Information Administration), have turned the spotlight on the impact of 
   technological advances on individual privacy.  In June, the FTC held a 
   workshop on online consumer privacy.  Privacy advocates, industry 
   representatives, and FTC officials gathered to discuss the privacy issues
   posed by the evolving online world, and potential policy and technology 
   solutions.

*  PUBLIC CONCERN AND NEWS COVERAGE:  The mainstream media's coverage of 
   privacy issues has increased dramatically.  The Lexis-Nexis P-Trak 
   controversy and the threats to medical records privacy garnered national 
   headlines.  A number of recent reports, such as a Georgia Tech survey 
   and Louis Harris poll, point to a growing public concern with the loss of 
   personal privacy in and out of the online world.   

*  CDT PRIVACY DEMO AND CLEARINGHOUSE:  Launched in June, CDT's Privacy 
   Demonstration and Privacy Policy Clearinghouse seeks to educate the 
   public about the extent to which personal information can be revealed 
   online.  When an Internet user visits the Privacy Demo, it displays 
   information about the user such as the kind of web browser and type of 
   computer they use, even the user's location and e-mail address.  The 
   Privacy Demo continues to receive an average of 1,000 hits a day.  

*  MARKET RESPONSES:  In some instances, the market has responded to public 
   outcries over threats to personal privacy.  This summer, information 
   service Lexis-Nexis was forced to revise a new online database, P-Trak, 
   suppressing social security numbers.  A number of Internet companies, 
   including Four11, I/PRO, and Match.com, formed a group called "Privacy 
   Assured" -- the members of the group agreed to a set of privacy 
   principles relating to the personal information that is collected, used, 
   and disseminated at their web sites.

*  FEDERAL GOV'T PRIVACY ENTITY:  Last month, Sally Katzen, head of the 
   Office of Management and Budget's Office of Information Regulatory 
   Affairs, announced that the Administration was considering various 
   options for the creation of a federal privacy entity, or coordinating 
   function, within the Executive Branch.  Pressure from privacy advocates 
   and the public, coupled with the European Union's Data Protection 
   Directive has created a climate where privacy issues may be given the 
   consideration and deliberation they deserve at the national deserve.  
   A report discussing the options will be made available for public 
   comment after the elections.

Privacy setbacks:

*  HEALTH INFORMATION:  The failure to enact comprehensive privacy 
   legislation to protect health information, such as the proposed 
   Bennett-Leahy "Medical Records Confidentiality Act", was a 
   disappointment.  The push to automate our health information embodied 
   in the Kennedy-Kassebaum "Health Insurance Portability and 
   Accountability Act of 1996," raises the stakes in the battle to protect 
   personal health records.

*  GOV'T COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION:  Despite growing public 
   concern over attacks on personal privacy, Congress passed legislation 
   that will escalate the collection of personal information by the 
   government.  Pressure to prevent fraud, to more effectively allocate 
   sparse government dollars, and to ensure that people are who they claim 
   to be, led to the enactment of laws that track and monitor the behavior 
   of individuals in order to identify "dead-beat dads", illegal immigrants,
   welfare cheats and others defrauding the public trust.  Massive record
   sharing, extension of existing data systems and the creation of new 
   highly-intrusive people tracking systems are core components of recently 
   passed welfare and immigration laws.

*  CELLULAR PHONE TRACKING:  A battle is being waged to ensure that our 
   nation's telecommunications system does not become the tracking device 
   of law enforcement.  The FBI recently requested technical specifications 
   that would require cellular carriers to have the capability to track and 
   monitor the whereabouts of anyone carrying a phone -- whether it was in 
   use or not -- and provide location and other information to law 
   enforcement on demand.  The proposed standards were rejected by the 
   cellular industry in September, but other battles over law enforcement's
   desire to increase its wire-tapping capability continue, promising to 
   keep privacy advocates on the watch.

When Congress is sworn in this January, CDT will be ready to work with 
other privacy advocates in building upon this past year's progress on 
privacy issues.  For more information and updates about these privacy 
issues, please visit CDT's Privacy Issues Page:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(2) P-TRAK UPDATE

This past summer, information service Lexis-Nexis offered a new database 
to its subscribers called P-Trak.  For a per-use fee, subscribers can use 
P-Trak obtain personal information about an individual that can include 
name, current and prior addresses, maiden names, birth month and year, and 
current telephone number.  Social Security numbers were initally available 
on P-Trak, however in June, Lexis-Nexis stopped displaying Social Security
numbers in response to complaints from consumers, privacy advocates, and
businesses.

As news about P-Trak spread over the Internet, more and more people 
expressed concern over the availability of their personal information 
online.  In response to a September 20 letter from Senator Richard Bryan 
(D-NV), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) immediately recommended that 
Congress take action to protect the privacy of personal information by 
amending the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).  The recommendations called 
for strengthening the Fair Credit Reporting Act to limit disclosure of 
information such as social security number, mother's maiden name, prior
addresses, and date of birth.  (See CDT Policy Post 2.33)

Despite the recommendations, Congress adjourned without taking action on 
them.  However, Congress added an amendment to the Omnibus Appropriations 
Bill which directs the Federal Reserve Board to examine whether the sale 
of "sensitive consumer identification information" creates "an undue 
potential for fraud".  Although this is a half-hearted response to the 
FTC's recommendations and the public's cry for action, it is a small tribute
to the power and importance of the Internet in turning public opinion into
action.  

Following passage of the bill, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, 
Science and Transportation, Sen. Larry Pressler (R-SD), ranking minority 
member Senator Ernest Hollings (D-SC), and Senator Richard Bryan (D-NV), 
sent a letter requesting the FTC to conduct a study of online and database
privacy issues.

While no legislation was enacted, the outcry over P-Trak proved useful in 
two other areas.  First, the P-Trak furor may have played a roll in 
eliminating an industry pushed exemption to the FCRA which would have 
allowed credit reports to be used to generate target marketing lists --
currently against FTC rules interpreting the FCRA.  Second, the recent
announcement by "Privacy Assured", a group of Internet companies that 
include Four11 and I/PRO, to voluntarily comply with a series of privacy
protective information practices is clearly tied to a desire to respond to
public concerns over individual privacy.

and the text of the bill requesting the Federal Reserve study, please visit

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>FTC Recommends Changes to Protect Personal Information</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Friday, September 20, the Federal Trade Commission

information by amending the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The FTC's
recommendations -- included in a letter to <A HREF="http://www.senate.gov/~bryan/" TARGET="NEW">Senator

<h3>Who's Watching You and What are You Telling Them?</h3>
Many people surf the web under the illusion that their actions are private and anonymous.  
Unfortunately, there is more information collected about you than you might think.  
Every time you visit a site, you leave a calling card that reveals where you're coming from, 
what kind of computer you have, and many other details.  Most sites keep logs of all visitors. 

<H3>But Others May Know A Lot More...</H3>

<font size = +1>
As a small non-profit public interest organization, CDT's web pages reside on a 
server run by our (very accommodating) Internet service provider, and as a result, 
our ability to collect even more revealing personal information than what is displayed 
above is limited.  However, a web site operator with the right equipment and the desire 
to do so can easily obtain your e-mail address, the exact files you viewed, and other 
detailed information without your knowledge.  And you reveal information to web site 
operators both directly and indirectly.<p> 

<H3>How Your Personal Information Gets Collected</H3>

<B>Web sites and Web browsers</B><p>

Your personal information (including your hobbies, political and product interests and 
ways to contact you, such as your e-mail address) can be collected by web sites in two 
ways: directly or indirectly.<p>

<UL>
<LI><B>Passive recording of Transactional Information:</B>  The transactional information 
revealed in the normal course of surfing the net reveals a great deal of information about 
your online activities. When you visit a particular web site, for example,  the webmaster 
can determine what files, pictures, or other information you are most interested in (and 
what you ignored), how long you examined a particular page, image or file, where you 
came from, where you went to.<p>

Web servers collect transactional information in order to allow the system operator to 
perform necessary system maintenance, auditing, and other essential system functions.  
However, when correlated with other sources of personal information, including marketing 
databases, phone books, voter registration lists, etc, a detailed profile of your online activities 
can be created without your knowledge or consent.<p>

<LI><B>Cookies:</B> Additionally, many web browsers contain a feature called "cookies," 
or client-side persistent information.  Cookies allows any web site to store information 
about your visit to that site on your hard drive.  Every time you return to that site, "cookies" 
will read your hard drive to find out if you've been there before.  For example, try visiting 
<A HREF="http://www.illuminatus.com/cookie">this web site</A>  twice.<p>

<LI><B>Direct disclosure of personal information:</B> A growing number of web sites 
offer users the ability to register with the site.  In many cases, registration brings real, 
important benefits, such as access to special areas, timely information, discounts, etc.  
While registration or other mechanisms by which users divulge personal information to a 
web site provide some obvious benefits to a users, it also provides the site's operator with 
a detailed picture of how you use the site.<p>
</UL>

Regardless of how the information is obtained, a great deal of personally identifiable 
information is revealed in the normal course of surfing the web. <p>

<B>Commercial Online Service Providers</B><p>

Commercial online service providers are configured in a variety of ways, but generally, 
little personally identifiable information is revealed to Internet sites visited directly from 
an online service.<p>

<STRONG>[Many commercial online service subscribers have reported problems accessing the CDT Privacy Demonstration from their service.  This has to do with the configuration of the Internet connection from the online service.]</STRONG> <P>

If you subscribe to a commercial online service, your service provider has access to lots 
of information about your online activities.  These records are generated in the normal 
course of using the service, and are important for billing and maintenance purposes.  
However, not all services treat the use and disclosure of this information the same way.  
CDT'S Clearinghouse on Privacy Policies focuses first on the fair information practices 
of the <A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/privacy/online_services/chart.html">major 
commercial online service providers</A>, including America Online, Compuserve, 
Microsoft Network and Prodigy.<p>

Later, CDT will focus on other Internet entities, such as browsers, content providers, 
and Internet service providers.<p> 

<H3>Why should you care?</H3>

Although it may not seem like it, someone is following you through cyberspace.  
Every time you retrieve a file, view an image, send an e-mail message or jump to a 
new web site, a record is created somewhere on the Net.<p>

While much of this information may never be used, it can be, and you have little 
control over it.  In the hands of a marketer with a powerful computer, or the government, 
it is possible to build a detailed profile of your tastes and preferences by monitoring your 
online activities.  The information can be used to send you unsolicited e-mail or snail mail, 
to call you, or to even put you on a list of people likely to support a particular political 
candidate.  A single piece of information about you can support a tremendous range of 
activities.  For example, if your repeated visits to web sites containing information on 
cigarettes results in free samples, coupons, or even e-mail to you about a new tobacco 
product, you may not be concerned.  However, if your visits to these web sites result in 
escalating insurance premiums due to categorization as a smoker - now you're beginning 
to get concerned.<p>

<h3>Privacy Policies and Practices</h3>

In the United States, there is no comprehensive law that protects people's privacy.  
Instead a patchwork of Constitutional, statutory and private sector guidelines that protect 
different areas of your informational privacy.<p>

<h3>CDT's Web Site Privacy Policy</h3>

Like virtually all web sites, CDT collects information to analyze traffic patterns and 
to perform routine system maintenance.   We do not use the system logs or other records 
for any other purpose, nor do we sell, rent or otherwise disclose our mailing lists.<p>

For the purposes of this demonstration, we will use information generated during your 
visit to the Privacy Web site to illustrate examples of what information you are revealing to us. 
None of the information generated during the course of your visit to this demonstration will be 
used for any other purposes, and logs will be purged on a regular basis.<P>

<h3>How to Surf without Being Watched</h3>

<A HREF="http://www.anonymizer.com"><B>The Anonymizer</B></A><P>

The Anonymizer was created by Community ConneXion ("C2") for those whose 
illusions of anonymity have been shattered.  It is a web site that shields your personal 
information from the other web sites that you visit.  By visiting the Anonymizer web site 
before visiting other web sites, you are assigned an anonymous identity which is revealed 
(instead of your real identity) as you surf the web.  It allows you to surf freely, even if you 
follow a hypertext link to another web site, without having to worry that the web site you 
are reading is keeping track of who you are and your interests.<p>

<P>
Basically, the amount of information you provide about yourself when you surf the Internet depends on:
<UL>
<LI>the type of Internet connection you use (Is it behind a firewall? Is it from a commerical online service provider?), and
<LI>the kind of browser you are using (and whether you have configured the browser options accurately.)
</UL>
The CGI script for the CDT Privacy Demonstration reflects information that
is obtained from commands such as &quot;finger&quot; and &quot;whois&quot;.  These commands can
be run on any Unix computer that is connected to the Internet.  The script
executes these commands and displays some of the information reported by
those commands.
<P>
Obtaining the visitor's e-mail address is a bit more tricky.  The script
uses a browser &quot;loophole&quot; to obtain that information.  <A HREF="#FTP">(The &quot;trick&quot;
involves anonymous FTP and reading FTP logs.)</A>  Not all browsers have this
&quot;loophole&quot;.  This is why e-mail addresses will appear for some site
visitors, but not others.
<P>
The script also utilizes a JAVA bug that &quot;makes&quot; a user with a particular
browser send e-mail to a predesignated address.  (This JAVA bug has been corrected in the latest versions
of the browser.)  We have set up an automatic reply message that informs
the visitor that they &quot;accidently&quot; sent e-mail to us just by visiting our
site.
<P>
The information you see about yourself when you visit the site is nothing
that a knowledgeable Internet user or web site owner <STRONG>could</STRONG> obtain about
you.  CDT had the assistance of <A HREF="thank_you.html">three knowledgeable programmers</A>, but as a public interest non-profit
organization, our technical resources aren't very sophisticated.  Imagine
what a well-financed web site operation that includes registration and
tracking software <STRONG>could</STRONG> learn about you.
<P>
An added note: sometimes not all information about a visitor is displayed
because response times with the server may be slow.  This explains why
someone may get more or less information with repeat visits.
<P><A NAME="FTP"></A>

<P>
<STRONG>Anonymous FTP and the <IMG SRC="/eyeball.gif" ALT="Eye"></STRONG>
<P>
Many computers on the Internet have public areas (FTP sites) where interested users can connect and obtain files.  These users do not have to be registered users of the site.  When a non-registered user connects to a &quot;public&quot; computer to obtain a file, the user is said to be using anonymous File Transfer Protocol, or anonymous FTP.  Many FTP sites ask users who connect anonymously to use their e-mail address as the password into the system.
<P>
When a user visits the Demonstration site, they obtain the graphic of the Eye by using anonymous FTP.  When some web browsers perform anonymous FTP transactions, they automatically use the e-mail address that is configured in the browser preferences as a password into the system.  After the visitor obtains the Eye graphic, the script grabs the password (the e-mail address) from the FTP transaction log that is kept for all FTP transactions and displays it to the site visitor.
<P>
Newer web browsers have changed this convention when using anonymously FTP.  They now use a standard password instead of the e-mail address that is configured in the browser settings.

(1) Your Privacy Online - CDT Unveils Demonstration & Clearinghouse

Many people surf the World Wide Web with an illusion of anonymity,
believing that their activities are unobserved and that they can explore
the Internet without leaving a trail.  In reality, this is not the case.

During the normal course of using the Internet, a great deal of personally
revealing information is routinely generated, collected, and stored.  Most
of this information is collected for purposes of system maintenance,
billing, or other necessary functions.  But a sophisticated marketer,
determined hacker, or law enforcement official can put together a detailed
profile of your online activities, personal tastes, interests, habits and
vices with relative ease.

Today, the Center for Democracy and Technology unveiled an interactive
privacy demonstration and privacy policy clearinghouse on our World Wide
Web site. The demonstration is located at

                    http://www.cdt.org/privacy/

The goals of the demonstration are two fold:

1. To educate the public about the extent to which personal information
   is automatically revealed online, and

2. To begin to make available examples of privacy and information usage
   policies that give people greater knowledge of and control over the
   personal information revealed online.  The current focus of this
   "Privacy Clearinghouse" is centered on commercial online service
   providers (ie, America Online, CompuServe, Prodigy, Microsoft).

Future updates of the clearinghouse will include information on Internet
Service Providers, content providers, and web browser software.  Future
updates will also explore the extent that users can employ various
technological solutions to control the collection and disclosure of personal
information.

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION TO HOLD HEARINGS ON ONLINE PRIVACY

On June 4 and 5, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will hold hearings to
explore online privacy issues.  The FTC is particularly interested in
exploring privacy protecting technologies which empower users to exercise
more control over the collection and use of personally identifiable
information online.

CDT has been invited to present testimony at the hearings.  Testimony and
other background information on the FTC hearings will be available at CDT's
web page at the end of next week. Details on the hearings are available at
http://www.ftc.gov/.

WHY SHOULD NETIZENS CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE?

Although it may not seem like it, someone is following you through
cyberspace.  Every time you retrieve a file, view an image, send an email
message or jump to a new web site, a record is created somewhere on the
Net.

While much of this information may never be used, it can be, and you have
little control over it.  In the hands of a marketer with a powerful
computer, or the government, it is possible to build a detailed profile of
your tastes and preferences by monitoring your online activities.

The information can be used to send you unsolicited email or snail mail, to
call you, or to even put you on a list of people likely to support a
particular political candidate.  A single piece of information about you
can support a tremendous range of activities.  For example, if your
repeated visits to web sites containing information on cigarettes results
in free samples, coupons, or even email to you about a new tobacco product,
you may not be concerned.  However, if your visits to these web sites
result in escalating insurance premiums due to categorization as a smoker -
now you're beginning to get concerned.

HOW PERSONAL INFORMATION IS COLLECTED ONLINE

Web sites and Web browsers
--------------------------

Your personal information (including your hobbies, political and product
interests and ways to contact you, such as your email address) can be
collected by web sites in two ways: directly or indirectly.

* PASSIVE RECORDING OF TRANSACTIONAL INFORMATION:  The transactional
  information revealed in the normal course of surfing the net reveals a
  great deal of information about your online activities. When you visit
  a particular web site, for example, the webmaster can determine what
  files, pictures, or other information you are most interested in (and
  what you ignored), how long you examined a particular page, image or
  file, where you came from, where you went to.

  Web servers collect transactional information in order to allow the
  system operator to perform necessary system maintenance, auditing, and
  other essential system functions.  However, when correlated with other
  sources of personal information, including marketing databases, phone
  books, voter registration lists, etc, a detailed profile of your
  online activities can be created without your knowledge or consent.

* COOKIES: Additionally, many web browsers contain a feature called 
  "cookies," or client-side persistent information.  Cookies allows any
  web site to store information about your visit to that site on your
  hard drive.  Every time you return to that site, "cookies" will read
  your hard drive to find out if you've been there before. (The Privacy
  Demonstration has a link to a site that utilizes cookies.)

* DIRECT DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION: A growing number of web
  sites offer users the ability to register with the site.  In many
  cases, registration brings real, important benefits, such as access to
  special areas, timely information, discounts, etc.  While registration
  or other mechanisms by which users divulge personal information to a
  web site provide some obvious benefits to a users, it also provides
  the site's operator with a detailed picture of how you use the site.

Regardless of how the information is obtained, a great deal of personally
identifiable information is revealed in the normal course of surfing the
web.

Commercial Online Service Providers
-----------------------------------

Commercial online service providers are configured in a variety of ways,
but generally, little personally identifiable information is revealed to
Internet sites visited directly from an online service.

If you subscribe to a commercial online service, your service provider has
access to lots of information about your online activities.  These records
are generated in the normal course of using the service, and are important
for billing and maintenance purposes.  However, not all services treat the
use and disclosure of this information the same way.

Please visit The Center for Democracy and Technology's Clearinghouse on
Privacy Policies (http://www.cdt.org/privacy/) for a detailed description of
the information practices of the major commercial online services.

Future updates of the clearinghouse will focus on other Internet entities,
such as browsers, content providers, and Internet service providers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) JOIN CONGRESSMAN RICK WHITE (R-WA) LIVE ONLINE TO TALK ABOUT THE
    INTERNET CAUCUS, THE CDA, AND TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS

Congressman Rick White (R-WA) will be live online at HotWired on Wednesday

<H2>Privacy Policy Chart - Online Service Providers</H2>

This Privacy Policy Chart details the fair information practices of major commercial online service providers.  We arrived at these results by analyzing the service providers' written polices (such as Terms of Service) and policies distributed online to subscribers.  
<P>
Boxes marked <STRONG>Yes</STRONG> indicate that the service provider practices this fair information policy, and that the practice is disclosed to members.

    <TH>Contents of your communications</TH><TD>The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) governs law enforcement access to the contents of your communications.  The law was updated in 1986 to cover electronic communications including email and computer-to-computer communications.  Law enforcement must get a warrant in order to access the contents of your message.  Whether law enforcement can get access to the contents of your email is largely dependent on the email retention policy of your service provider.  For example, if the policy of your service is to only retain the email header once you've read your email, then law enforcement will not have access to read the contents of your email.  </TD>

    <TH>Personally Identifiable Transactional Data</TH><TD>The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (commonly known as the Digital Telephony Act) amended ECPA, increasing the privacy protection for online transactional information. The law now includes a heightened standard for law enforcement access to transactional data generated by electronic communications services. Instead of a mere subpoena, law enforcement officials must obtain a court order based on "specific and articulable facts" that such records are "relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation" (sec 207 (a)(2)).</TD>

<H2>Definition of Terms</H2>
<A NAME="notice"></A><BR>
<STRONG>Notice</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
In an online context, notice means that online service subscribers or Internet
users learn from the online service provider or web site about whether and
to what extent personal information is being collected and used.  <A NAME=
"informed"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Informed</STRONG> (an important subset of notice)<BR>
<BR>
For a notice of information practice to be truly effective, it must be clearly
written and non-coercive.  For you to be &quot;informed&quot; means understanding
who is collecting information about your online activities, and the purposes
for which the information is being collected.  <BR>
<BR>
There are two ways in which your personal information (including product
preferences, relevant interests and direct contact information) can be collected.
 First, when you actively provide information to a web site, such as when
you purchase products or register as a member, you are actively providing
personal information that may be collected and stored for a particular purpose.
 Second, while you are engaged in &quot;passive&quot; online activity --
for example when you are lurking in chat rooms, reading bulletin boards,
or browsing through online resources -- your personal information is also
being collected, and possibly stored or used for other purposes.  Thus,
personal information can be collected through both your passive browsing
and active communication.  <BR>
<BR>
Notice of information practices is particularly important when you participate
in online passive activity and you have the illusion of anonymity, as well
as when your personal information is to be used for a purpose unrelated
to the one for which you provided your information.<A NAME="consent"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Consent</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
The principal of consent means that you give an organization permission
to handle your information in a way that you choose.  When you give personally
identifiable information to an organization or when you engage in an activity
that generates a record, the individual or entity collecting your information
should get your &quot;informed consent&quot; --  which means that before
your consent can be considered meaningful, you will be given <A HREF="#notice">full
details about what information is to be collected, the purpose of the collection,
and when the information will be disclosed to others</A>. <A NAME="secondary"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Secondary Use</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Secondary use means that the information collected about you for one purpose
is used for a second, unrelated purpose.  A fundamental fair information
principle is that you must be given the opportunity to choose whether you
want your information used for a secondary purpose.  This allows you to
provide personal information for a specific purpose without worrying that
the information may be later used for an unrelated purpose without your
permission.   <A NAME="access"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Access</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Access is defined as the ability to see and obtain the information that
an entity has collected about you.  You should also have the opportunity
to <A HREF="#correction">amend records</A> that are not accurate, relevant,
timely or complete.  Over the Internet, the access principle may be achieved
in real-time (immediately upon request). <A NAME="correction"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Correction</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
If information about you is incomplete or inaccurate, an entity should always
give you the ability to make additions or corrections.  <A NAME="downstream"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Down Stream Data Use</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Down stream data use means that information collected about you may be disclosed
to other parties &quot;downstream&quot; to facilitate a transaction.  For
example, suppose you are a member of a commercial online service provider
(e.g., America Online), and you want to order a product from a content provider
on that service (e.g., L.L. Bean).  You may directly give the content provider
your personal information, such as your address, telephone number and credit
card number.  Or your commercial online service provider may give the content
provider your personal information so that your order may be completed.
 Then, the content provider may disclose your personal information to a
shipping company (e.g., Federal Express) so that your order can be delivered
to your house.  The content provider may also disclose your personal information
to a billing or credit card company (e.g., Visa) so that they can charge
you for this transaction.  <A NAME="remedies"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Remedies</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Remedies is a legal term that describes ways that you can be compensated
for harm caused by another individual or entity.  An example would be the
awarding of monetary damages, or a judicial order requiring specific action
to fix the harm.<A NAME="anonymity"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Anonymity</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
To be anonymous means your true identity is not known at all.  Pseudonymity
means you have taken on an assumed identity.  Your online  service provider
may allow you, as a subscriber, to participate in online activities anonymously
(not known at all) or pseudonymously (taking on a different identity). 
 <A NAME="security"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Security</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Security means technical measures that you or your online service provider
may take to protect your privacy.  There are a number of ways online services
can safeguard data, through passwords, audit trails, and encryption.  <A
NAME="use"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Use</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Use means that your personal data is collected and is being used internally
within the company or organization, for both administrative and marketing
purposes; e.g., an online service provider using its own subscriber data
to market a new service to its subscribers.<A NAME="disclosure"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Disclosure</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Disclosure means that the company or organization makes your personal information
available to third parties, e.g., marketing lists, other companies providing
similar services, etc. <A NAME="online"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commercial Online Service</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
A commercial online service maintains a closed proprietary network that
provides a variety of information and other services to its subscribers.
 Commercial online services generally provide their own content, forums,
and information available only to its subscribers. <A NAME="subscription"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Subscription Data</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Subscription data is the information that you provide to an online service
when you sign up to become a member.  Subscription data usually includes
your name, physical address, email address, billing information, and telephone
numbers.<A NAME="person_id"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Personally Identifiable Transactional Data</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Personally identifiable transactional data is the information describing
your online activities, including web sites you have visited, <A HREF="#e-mail">whom
you have sent email</A>, what files you have downloaded, and other information
revealed in the normal course of using the Internet.  Transactional data
differs from the <A HREF="#content">content of a communication</A> in that
it is not the actual substance of your communication, but the information
about your communication. <BR>
<BR>
Traditionally, the content of your communications has received greater protections
in the law that transactional data.  Recent developments in the law have
given greater protections to transactional data in that it is just as revealing
as the content of your communications.  <A NAME="collection"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Collection</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
The collection of personal information online occurs in two ways.  First,
information is collected through your active provision of information, such
as when you purchase a product online or when you join as a member of a
web site.  Second, while you are engaged in &quot;passive&quot; online activity
-- for example when you are lurking in chat rooms, reading bulletin boards,
or browsing through online resources -- your personal information is also
being collected and possibly stored, all under your illusion of anonymity.
Also, when you <A HREF="#ftp">ftp a file</A>, your actions may generate
a record that is personally identifiable.  <A NAME="limitation"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Limitation on Collection</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Collection should be limited only to information necessary to complete the
transaction.  In instances where <A HREF="#person_id">personally identifiable
information</A> is not necessary to support the activity, you should have
an opportunity to limit its collection.  The goal of this principle is to
avoid unnecessary information collection and to prevent people from taking
advantage of you by collecting more information than necessary as a condition
of providing you a service or product.  For instance, if an online service
provider required you to provide a copy of your tax returns as a condition
of becoming a member, it would be far beyond information that the service
needed to sign you up as a subscriber.<A NAME="content"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Content</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
The content of a communication is the actual text of the communication or
information sent.  This includes files, text or graphics.  For example,
content is the text of your email message or your <A HREF="#newsgroup">Usenet
posting</A>.  Content does not include routing information, the date, time,
or subject of the message, or other  <A HREF="#person_id">transactional
data</A>. <A NAME="e-mail"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>E-mail Header</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
The email header is the transactional information that identifies the sender
and recipient of a message, routing information, the date and time at which
the message was sent, and the subject of the message.<A NAME="downloaded"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Downloaded</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
In this context, downloaded e-mail may also include mail that is read online.
 Check your online service provider agreement for specific details.<BR>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="ISP"></A><STRONG>Glossary of Internet Terms</STRONG></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<STRONG>Internet Service Provider (ISP)<BR>
<BR>
</STRONG>An internet service provider is a company that provides direct
access to the Internet for educational institutions, individuals, companies
and organizations.  Unlike a commercial online service provider, ISPs typically
do not provide their own content.<A NAME="newsgroup"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Usenet Newsgroups<BR>
</STRONG><BR>
Usenet is a worldwide network of discussion threads, or series of postings,
on a variety of topics.  Usenet is available to most Internet users and
is controlled by no single entity.  Currently there are over 14,000 Usenet
newsgroups.  Some newsgroups are moderated (screened to ensure that the
content of your message is appropriate for the group) and some are unmoderated
(not screened prior to posting).<A NAME="maillist"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Mailing list<BR>
<BR>
</STRONG>Mailing lists are email-based discussion forums on various topics
of interest.   An interested Internet user can subscribe to a mailing list
by sending an e-mail message containing appropriate instructions to a specific
e-mail address.  The computer that houses the mailing list program maintains
a list of subscribers and routes all posted messages to subscribers' electronic
mailboxes.   Mailing lists are either publicly and privately maintained,
and can be moderated or unmoderated.<A NAME="site"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Web site</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
A web site is a specific area of the Internet that integrates a variety
of files, such as text, graphics, sound, and video files.  Companies, governments,
non-profit organizations and individuals can all provide information and
interactive services through their web sites.  Anyone with a web site can
be considered a content provider, or a publisher.<A NAME="browser"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Web browser<BR>
<BR>
</STRONG>A web browser is a program that allows you to search or surf the
World Wide Web.  Some examples of web browsers include Netscape Navigator
and Microsoft Internet Explorer.<A NAME="ftp"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
A software protocol that is used to transfer files from a remote host over

<BIG><STRONG>Hearing Held on &quot;Children's Privacy&quot; Legislation</STRONG></BIG> <FONT SIZE=-1>[September 13, 1996]</FONT>
<P>
The increasing use of the Internet by children, combined with the ease of
collecting personal information online, raise serious privacy issues.  Over the past several months, concerns about the availability and use of personal information in the online world, particularly with respect to the collection and use of information about children, have prompted Congress to seriously consider this important issue.
<P>
Legislation designed to restrict the collection and use of personal
information about children without parental consent was introduced
by Rep. Bob Franks (R-NJ) on May 22, 1996.  While the bill (<A HREF="HR3508_text.html">H.R. 3508</A>) is supported by various groups, including Enough is Enough and Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), it has sparked concerns from cyber-rights advocates that it may end up increasing the collection of personal information online and result in restrictions on the free flow of information.
<P>
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), People for the American Way (PFAW) Action Fund, Voters Telecommunications Watch (VTW), and CDT sent Rep. Franks a letter regarding his legislation on June 4, 1996.  In the letter, the groups expressed concern that the bill, in its current form, raises some of the same privacy and free flow of information concerns raised by the Exon/Coats <A HREF="/cda.html">&quot;Communications Decency Act&quot;</A> to the extent that it is extremely difficult to know whether or not a person visiting a web site is or is not a child without requiring all visitors to identify themselves.
<P>
On September 12, 1996, the Crime Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the bill.  CDT sent <A HREF="960911_subcomm_let.html">a letter</A> to subcommittee members reiterating its concerns about the bill.

Among the several topics discussed at <A HREF="/privacy/FTC_hearings.html">FTC hearings</A> held on June 4-5, 1996 was the issue of children's privacy on the Internet.  These hearings highlighted the current and future availability of technologies which empower users and parents to exercise more control over the collection and use of personal information.

<TITLE>CDT | Update on the Counter-Terrorism Bill</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">

<H3>More on the Counter-Terrorism Bill that passed the House on August 2, 1996</H3>

On Friday August 2, the House of Representatives passed a revised counter-terrorism bill by a margin of 389 to 22.  The House-passed bill DOES NOT contain ANY of the privacy threatening provisions.  Provisions dealing with funding for the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (Digital Telephony) were REMOVED from the bill just before the vote after civil liberties groups AND the FBI objected to the language. Provisions dealing with emergency wiretap authority and "roving wiretaps" were also not included in the House-passed bill.
<P>
In addition, the bill does not contain any encryption provisions. On July 29, the Administration had circulated <A HREF="960729_admin_fact.html">an outline of their
anti-terrorism proposal</A> which included new, unspecified restrictions on
encryption.  Senators Conrad Burns (R-MT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Larry Pressler (R-SD), Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
(R-MS), and others worked hard to prevent any encryption provisions from
being included in early versions of the bill, and deserve a lot of credit
for fighting for the Net. 
<P>
The bill passed today contains provisions increasing airport security,
studies on ways to improve US anti-terrorism policy and other terrorism
issues, and a provision expanding federal racketeering laws
to cover terrorist activity.
<P>
The bill also contains a small, but not insignificant, privacy victory. The
bill doubles the punishment from 5 to 10 years for unlawful disclosure of
information obtained from a warrant and increases certain penalties for
violation of the Privacy Act.
<P>
The Senate did not vote on the bill before they recessed for the month.  The Senate will most likely take up consideration of the bill when Congress returns in September.  This means that this issue isn't over yet.  The Senate could add provisions to the bill, such as Digital Telephony funding and proposed restrictions on encryption, so stay tuned....
<P>
Thanks to everyone who called Congress to object to the new sweeping
surveillance provisions that were dropped from the bill! It looks like we
may have really made a difference in this debate.

(1) CLINTON ADMINISTRATION, CONGRESS PROPOSE SWEEPING ANTI-TERRORISM 
    INITIATIVES

In the wake of the recent bombing at the Olympics and the suspected
terrorist involvement in the TWA crash, the Clinton Administration and
members of Congress are proposing a set of sweeping counter-terrorism
initiatives. If enacted into law, these proposals will dramatically
increase law enforcement surveillance authority over the Internet and other
advanced communications technologies. An outline of the Administration's
proposal was circulated on Capitol Hill on Monday July 29.

President Clinton has urged Congress to pass new counter-terrorism
legislation before the Congressional recess at the end of this week.  While
several prominent Republican members of Congress, including House Speaker
Newt Gingrich (R-GA), have said publicly that Congress should not rush into
any new counter-terrorism legislation, most observers believe there is a
strong possibility that some or all of the Administration's proposal will
be enacted before the August recess.

The draft proposal contains several measures which were rejected by
Congress as part of the previous counter-terrorism initiative proposed 
last year after the Oklahoma City bombing, as well as several new measures
including as-yet unspecified changes to U.S. encryption policy and funding
for the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, a.k.a.
Digital Telephony).

CDT is concerned that the latest counter-terrorism efforts on Capitol Hill
are occurring without appropriate deliberation.  Major policy decisions
expanding the surveillance powers of law enforcement should not be made
without careful consideration of the necessity of such proposals and the
relative benefit to society. In the coming days and weeks, CDT will work
with Congressional leaders, privacy advocates, and the net.community to
ensure that constitutional civil liberties and the openness of the Internet
are protected as Congress considers counter-terrorism measures.
________________________________________________________________________

MAJOR POINTS OF THE COUNTER-TERRORISM PROPOSALS CIRCULATING ON THE HILL

The administration's new counter-terrorism initiative and other amendments
circulating this week in Congress contain numerous provisions, but four 
are of particular concern to the net.community:

* New Threats to Encryption, Opposition to the Pro-CODE Bill
* Funding for Digital Telephony Without Public Accountability
* Amendment to Criminalize 'Bomb-Making' Information on the Internet
* Expanded Authority for Multi-Point, "Roving" Wiretaps

The full text of the Administration's proposal and background information
are available at CDT's counter-terrorism Web Page:

    http://www.cdt.org/policy/terrorism/

       --------------------------------------------------------

I. NEW THREATS TO ENCRYPTION, OPPOSITION TO THE PRO-CODE BILL

The Administration's outline contains the following statement on encryption:

 "* Encryption -- We will seek legislation to strengthen our ability to
    prevent terrorists from coming into the possession of the technology
    to encrypt their communications and data so that they are beyond the
    reach of law enforcement.  We oppose legislation that would eliminate
    current export barriers and encouraging the proliferation of encryption
    which blocks appropriate access to protect public safety and the 
    national security."

While no specific legislative language has yet been proposed, this 
represents the first statement by the Administration that they will seek
legislation to further restrict encryption.  Even more troubling, the
Administration is clearly attempting to use the recent suspected terrorist
incidents to push for a new and more restrictive encryption policy.

This new proposal comes as Congress is finally beginning to seriously
consider major changes in U.S. encryption policy. Bipartisan legislation
in both the House and Senate to relax encryption export controls is gaining
momentum.  The Senate Commerce Committee has held 3 hearings in the last 6
weeks, and is preparing to vote to send the Burns/Leahy "Pro-CODE" bill (S.
1726) to the floor of the Senate.  The Administration's attempt to leverage
the public's concern about terrorism to block passage of the Pro-CODE bill 
is disturbing, and poses a significant threat to privacy and security on the
Internet.

CDT is working with members of Congress, privacy advocates, and the
communications and computer industries to oppose any attempt by the
Administration to impose new restrictions on encryption, and we continue to
work to move the bipartisan export relief legislation through Congress.

       --------------------------------------------------------

II. FUNDING FOR DIGITAL TELEPHONY WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

The Administration is also seeking to override the public accountability
provisions of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA
- a.k.a. 'Digital Telephony') by providing a funding for the law in a way
that prevents public oversight of the FBI's surveillance ability.

Enacted in October of 1994, granted law enforcement new authority to
influence the design of telecommunications networks (the Internet,
Commercial online services, and BBS's were exempted) in order to preserve
their ability to conduct court authorized electronic surveillance.

Congress balanced this new authority with a number of mechanisms to ensure
public accountability over law enforcement surveillance ability.
While complicated, the public accountability mechanisms are designed to
work as follows:

* Law enforcement provides telecommunications carriers, the Congress,
  and the public with notice of its surveillance capacity needs (i.e.,
  the number of simultaneous wiretaps in a given geographic location)
  with an opportunity for public comment.

* Based on an assessment of the reasonableness of the law enforcement
  surveillance capacity request, Congress appropriates money to cover
  the cost of modifications.  If Congress does not believe law
  enforcement has adequately justified its request, money will not be
  appropriated.

* Telecommunications carriers are not obligated to comply with the
  statute or make any capacity modifications without government
  reimbursement.

In October 1995, the FBI published its first notice of surveillance
capacity (see CDT Policy Post Vol. 1, No. 26).  The telecommunications
industry and privacy advocates used the public accountability provisions of
CALEA to respond to the FBI's request and argued that the FBI had not
adequately justified the extensive surveillance capability contained in the
request.  As a result, Congress has not yet appropriated funds and no
modifications have been made.

The FBI clearly believes that the public accountability provisions of CALEA
are working **too well**, and appears to be using the recent focus on
terrorism to push for a new funding mechanism which does not contain public
oversight.

CDT is fighting hard to ensure that the public accountability provisions of
CALEA, which have until now prevented the FBI from acquiring unnecessary
surveillance capacity, remain a part of the law, and will vigorously oppose
any effort by the FBI and the Clinton Administration to remove the last
opportunity for public oversight over law enforcement power.

       --------------------------------------------------------

III. THE AVAILABILITY OF 'BOMB-MAKING' INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET

Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has reintroduced an amendment to make it
illegal to disseminate information on how to construct explosives knowing
that the information will be used in furtherance of a federal crime.  The 
amendment was adopted by the Senate earlier this month as part of a 
Department of Defense Appropriations bill.  CDT believes that the vague 
provisions of the Feinstein amendment could have a chilling effect on online
speech, needlessly duplicate existing criminal statutes, and should be 
removed.

Feinstein first proposed the amendment as part of the 1995
counter-terrorism bill. The initial Feinstein amendment was extremely broad
and would have resulted in a flat ban on certain constitutionally protected
speech online.  After civil liberties advocates objected, Feinstein
narrowed her amendment substantially, although it was ultimately dropped
from the final terrorism bill signed in April 1996.

       --------------------------------------------------------

IV.  EXPANDED WIRETAP AUTHORITY

The Administration's proposal would also significantly expand current
wiretapping authority to allow multi-point (or "roving") wiretaps. This
would dramatically change surveillance authority to include wiretaps of
INDIVIDUALS instead of LOCATIONS.

This proposal would do away with the delicate balance between privacy and
law enforcement that Congress has struck over 30 years of wiretapping
legislation. Federal law has always required that wiretaps issue for a
specific location, to meet Fourth Amendment requirements. In 1986 Congress
introduced a narrow exception to this rule, only for cases where it could
be shown that the target was intentionally evading wiretaps by changing
facilities. The Administration proposal would completely remove this
standard, allowing so-called "roving taps" for any persons whose behavior
makes wiretapping difficult for law enforcement.

The administration proposed similar provisions in the spring of 1995 in the
wake of the Oklahoma City bombing. These provisions proved controversial in
Congress and were dropped from the final bill.

INTRODUCTION

Late Wednesday, Congress and the Clinton Administration reached a
preliminary agreement on a sweeping new surveillance initiative. The
President and several Congressional leaders are pushing for a vote on the
measure BEFORE CONGRESS RECESSES ON AUGUST 2.

If enacted, parts of the proposal would dramatically impact privacy and
security on the Internet and other advanced communications technologies.

Of particular concern are provisions which:

1. Allows law enforcement to wiretap &quot;suspected terrorists&quot; for up to
   48 hours BEFORE obtaining a court order
2. Provide funding for the Digital Telephony Proposal without any public
   accountability over how the FBI spends the funds

Other provisions are also circulating that would:

3. Threaten to impose new restrictions on encryption technologies
4. Seek to criminalize the distribution of 'bomb-making' information on
   the Internet that is legal in print.

Congress needs to hear from you.  Congress will rush through the passage
of massive new surveillance plans with privacy risks unless you
show them there is support for slow, deliberate, reasoned thought on
the issue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

                 CALL KEY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IMMEDIATELY!
                      NO LATER THAN FRIDAY (8/2/96)

Please contact as many elected officials on the list below as you can.
Urge them to &quot;go slow&quot; and carefully consider the impact these
surveillance proposals will have on the privacy and security of
all Internet users.

Tell them while you appreciate their concern about combating terrorism,
the measures being proposed have many potential side effects which must be
carefully considered.

1. Call the key members of Congress below and ask them to &quot;go slow&quot; and
   examine the issues before rushing into changing the delicate balance
   of law enforcement surveillance and the public.

2. If you are at a loss for words, use the following sample communique:

        SAMPLE COMMUNIQUE

        Dear _________,

        Please do not rush the passage of counter terrorism legislation;
        I'm concerned that Congress is rushing without carefully
        considering the implications of privacy.  I'm from &lt;city, state&gt;.

        Thanks, &lt;click&gt;

   You should call the following members of Congress because they
   are steering this legislation and need to hear there is support
   for slow, deliberate, thoughtful consideration of this issue.
   Some of thee members *have publicly expressed reservations* about this
   legislation, and we should support them in their efforts.

BACKGROUND

Among other things, the law enforcement proposals circulating on Capitol
Hill include provisions which:

o WIRETAPPING WITHOUT COURT ORDER ALLOWED FOR 48 HOURS

  Congress and the President have already agreed to provisions which
  would dramatically expand law enforcement surveillance authority. Both
  of these provisions were proposed by the President as part of the 1995
  counter-terrorism legislation, but were dropped from the final bill
  after Republicans and civil liberties advocates objected.

  The current proposal would expand law enforcement surveillance
  authority in two ways:

  - Emergency 48 Hour Wiretap Authority: Current law requires law
    enforcement officials to get the affirmative consent of a judge
    before installing a wiretap.

    The current proposal would expand law enforcement authority to
    wiretap &quot;suspected terrorists&quot; for up to 48 hours before obtaining a
    court order, limiting a critical 4th amendment safeguard.

  - Multi-Point &quot;Roving&quot; Wiretaps: Current law allows law enforcement to
    tap only specific LOCATIONS (i.e., a telephone number). In certain
    very limited circumstances, law enforcement can tap a specific
    INDIVIDUAL if it can be shown to a judge that the suspect is moving
    from place to place with the specific intent of thwarting law
    enforcement.

  The current proposal would expand this so-called &quot;roving&quot; wiretap
  authority by making it much easier for law enforcement to tap specific
  INDIVIDUALS as opposed to specific physical locations.  This change
  would dramatically effect the balance between 4th Amendment privacy
  rights and public safety which has existed for nearly 30 years, and
  should not be enacted without careful consideration of the
  implications.

o FUNDING FOR DIGITAL TELEPHONY WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

  The Administration and Congress are seeking funding to implement the
  Digital Telephony Law in a way which eliminates any opportunity for
  public oversight of law enforcement surveillance ability.

  The controversial law, known officially as the Communications
  Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), granted the FBI new
  authority to influence the design of telecommunications networks.  At
  the same time, the law provided substantial public oversight over the
  FBI's surveillance ability by requiring the FBI to state, on the
  public record, what its surveillance needs are.

  The FBI has faced stiff resistance from civil liberties groups and some
  members of Congress and has not yet been able to obtain funding to
  implement the requirements of the law.

  As part of the current proposal, the FBI is seeking a mechanism which
  will provide funding for CALEA in a way which skirts the public
  oversight provisions of the law.  This is an extremely troubling move
  by law enforcement which, if enacted, would allow law enforcement
  essentially unlimited authority to influence the design of
  telecommunications networks without any accountability.

Other provisions which could show up in legislation in the next 72 hours are:

o BOMB MAKING MATERIAL ON THE INTERNET

  In the wake of the recent public concern about terrorism, Senators
  Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Joseph Biden (D-DE) have renewed their
  efforts to pass legislation to restrict the availability of 'bomb-
  making' information on the Internet.

  The Feinstein/Biden amendment was added to the Senate Defense
  Appropriations bill (S. 1762) in early July, and is not currently part
  of the new law enforcement initiative.  However, the amendment poses a
  serious threat to chill the the free flow of information on the
  Internet.

o THREATEN TO IMPOSE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES:

  While no specific legislation has been proposed, the Clinton
  Administration has circulated an outline to Congress which states:

    &quot;We will seek legislation to strengthen our ability to
    prevent terrorists from coming into the possession of the technology
    to encrypt their communications and data so that they are beyond the
    reach of law enforcement.&quot;

  This statement marks the first time that the Administration has
  suggested legislation to restrict encryption.  This is especially
  troubling because it comes at a time of growing Congressional support
  for legislation to promote privacy and security tools for the Net.
  Of even more concern, the Administration is clearly attempting to use
  the recent suspected terrorist incidents to push for a new and more
  restrictive encryption policy.

  If the Administration succeeds in passing new restrictions on
  encryption as part of the new surveillance legislation, the future
  of the Internet as a secure and trusted platform for commerce and
  private communication will be threatened.

Some or all of these provisions may be included in a package voted
on by both houses by August 3rd.  It is not clear what a final bill
will look like, and some of these provisions may not be considered by
Congress until later this summer.

</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<H3>FACT SHEET ON ADMINISTRATION ANTI-TERRORISM PROPOSALS</H3>
<BR>
July 29, 1996
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Multi-Point Wiretaps</STRONG> - These were authorized by the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act of 1986 (as amended), codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2518 (11).
 We propose harmonizing the standards for obtaining a roving microphone
and a roving electronic intercept.  Under existing law, roving microphone
interceptions require only a demonstration of probable cause that it is
&quot;impracticable&quot; to use a standard uni-point order, while roving
electronic interceptions require a demonstration of probable cause that
the subject is attempting to evade surveillance by changing telephone devices.
 This latter standard is extremely difficult to meet in the investigative
phase of a case.  By way of example, an individual switching between multiple
cellular telephones, all of which he can carry in a brief case, may be doing
so to defraud a cellular carrier rather than to evade surveillance.  Since
the burden is on the government to demonstrate probable cause, an absence
of proof means that the burden is not met.  Absent a court order, multi-point
surveillance like nonconsensual uni-point intercepts is punishable as a
crime or a civil offense and evidence gained through the illegal surveillance
is subject to suppression.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Pen Registers and Trap-and-trace devices for foreign intelligence investigations</STRONG> - Pen registers are devices which record numbers dialed on a telephone.
 Trap and trace devices record the incoming number, similar to Caller ID.
 Neither records the content of the conversation.  Both may be issued on
a representation by an attorney for the government - generally an Assistant
United States Attorney - that the information is &quot;relevant to an ongoing
criminal investigation,&quot; 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3123(a). In FISA investigations,
a full electronic intercept order, approved by the Attorney General must
be sought.  We seek to harmonize the FISA and criminal standards so that
a FISA application may be made on the same showing and representation. Under
existing law, a FISA pen register could not be authorized under the criminal
standard and the use of a pen register without a court order may result
in criminal and/or civil penalties.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Taggants</STRONG> - Congress should fund at $25 million a six-month study of
identification taggants-- microscopic particles which are identifiable and
which are designed to survive an explosion -- and thereafter permit the
Treasury Department to promulgate regulations -- subject to a 45 day review
period --which would criminalize the possession of untagged explosives,
including black powder and smokeless powder.  The 1996 Terrorism Act expressly
excludes the study and regulation of black powder.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Common Carrier and Public Accommodation Records</STRONG> - We seek authority
for the FBI to issue administrative requests - National Security Letters
- to common carriers, hotels, communications providers and storage facilities
for records in foreign counterintelligence (FCI) cases. Under existing law,
grand jury subpoenae may be issued in criminal cases, see Fed. R.Crim. P.
6(e), the Attorney General has authority which she has delegated to certain
Federal agents in narcotics cases to issue administrative subpoenae. We
seek the same authority as exists in routine criminal cases for the FBI
in FCI cases.  Under existing law, carriers need not comply with an FBI
request and there is no sanction for them not doing so.  Those who fail
to comply with a valid grand jury and/or administrative subpoena are subject
to penalties which may include criminal contempt.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Emergency Wiretap Authority</STRONG> - These are authorized in ECPA in 18 U.S.C.
Sec 2518(7) and permit the Attorney General (and Deputy) to authorize an
emergency wiretap without a court order for 48 hours in certain limited
situations involving organized crime, national security or immediate risk
of injury.  At the conclusion of the 48 hours, a standard application must
be presented to a Judge and if the  intercept order is not approved by the
judge, evidence gained during the 48-hour period cannot be used. We seek
to expand the emergency situation to those which are clearly-terrorist related
but which do not trigger one of the exceptions. An emergency order granted
outside of the specified statutory criteria would constitute an illegal
intercept and would subject the interceptor to criminal and civil penalties
and the evidence to suppression.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Terrorist Offenses as RICO Predicate</STRONG> - The Racketeer Influenced Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) provides severe criminal, civil and forfeiture
penalties for organizations engaged in certain conduct.  Although most serious
violations are RICO predicates, terrorist acts are not.  We propose to make
terrorism offenses RICO predicates to [sic] that investigators and prosecutors
can utilize the proven tools of the statute which include freezing assets,
lengthy sentences of imprisonment and favorable case law.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Expanded Predicates</STRONG> - ECPA limits the Federal felonies which can constitute
a sufficient predicate for an intercept order, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2516(1).
 We propose that any Federal felony ought to constitute a Section 2516(1)
predicate when there is a nexus to terrorist activity.  While most crimes
which are likely predicates in terrorism cases are already listed, in the
early stages of a terrorism investigation, it is entirely possible that
the only predicate may be a relatively technical crime. By way of example,
explosives shipped to a terrorist in the United States but labeled on a
Customs declaration as &quot;medical supplies&quot; give rise to a putative
violation of Customs statues. While more serious violation may become apparent
through further investigation, investigators may only have the relatively
technical false statement violation in the first instance. Under existing
law, a court order could not issue. If an intercept were conducted, it would
be illegal and could lead to criminal and civil penalties as well as the
suppression of evidence.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Statute of Limitations On Unregistered Firearms/Explosives Devices</STRONG> -
We propose extending the statute of limitations for firearms registrations
offenses -- crimes designed to prohibit the possession of machine guns and
short-barreled firearms -- from 3 to 5 years. The five-year statute of limitations
applies to virtually all other Federal crimes, including the misuse of the
Smokey the Bear emblem.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Encryption</STRONG> - We will seek legislation to strengthen our ability to prevent
terrorists from coming into possession of the technology to encrypt their
communications and data so that they are beyond the reach of law enforcement.
 We oppose legislation that would eliminate current export barriers and
encouraging the proliferation of encryption which blocks appropriate access
to protect public safety and the national security.<BR>

<title>Clinton Administration Counter Terrorism Initiative</title>
<body>

<H2><CENTER>Clinton Administration Counter Terrorism Initiative</CENTER></H2>

<H3>I.	Actions Already Announced by the President</H3>

<B>(1) Pass the Omnibus Counter-Terrorism Act of 1995</B>
<ul>
<li>This bill would provide clear Federal criminal jurisdiction for any international terrorist attack that might occur in the United States; provide Federal criminal jurisdiction over terrorists who use the United States as the place from which to plan terrorist attacks overseas; provide a workable mechanism, utilizing United States District Judges appointed by the Chief Justice, to deport expeditiously alien terrorists without risking the disclosure of national security information or techniques; provide a new mechanism for preventing fundraising in the United States that supports international terrorist activities overseas; and would implement an international treaty requiring the insertion of a chemical agent into plastic explosives when manufactured to make them detectable.
</ul>
<p>

<B>	(2) Provide more tools to federal law enforcement agencies fighting terrorism</B>
<ul>
<li><B>Amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to Ease access to financial and credit reports in anti-terrorism cases. </B>This legislation provides for disclosures by consumer reporting agencies to the FBI for counterintelligence and counterterrorism purposes. The FBI has no mechanism for obtaining credit reports for lead purposes in counterterrorism cases. These reports are available to used car dealers and other merchants. The FBI currently has authority under the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 to obtain similar records pursuant to a "National Security Letter" signed by a high-ranking FBI official. the same procedures and safeguards would apply to credit records under this proposal.
<p>
<li><B>Amend Federal law to adopt, in national security cases the standard currently used in obtaining a "pen register" in a routine criminal case.</B> This proposal would extend the relaxed standard for obtaining "pen registers" and "trap and trace" device orders which already exists in routine criminal cases, to national security cases. A "pen register" is a device which records the number dialed on a telephone. A "trap and trace" devices is similar to "Caller ID," providing law enforcement with the telephone number from which a call originates. Neither "pen registers" nor "trap and trace" devices permit law enforcement to monitor actual conversations being conducted. the current, higher-than-regular standard impedes the ability of the FBI to obtain surveillance coverage of terrorists and spies.
<p>
<li><B>Pass legislation to require hotel/Motel and common carriers to provide records necessary for fighting terrorism.</B> This proposal would require hotel/motel and common carriers such as airlines and bus companies to provide records to the FBI pursuant to authorized national security requests just as they must do now for virtually all state and local law enforcement. The FBI must now rely on the voluntary assistance of motel, hotel, and other innkeepers or common carriers regarding records of terrorists who may have stayed at the establishment or used the common carrier. The FBI has found that, while some of these entities voluntarily provide such information, an increasing number refuse, absent a court order, a subpoena, or other legal protection. In a counterterrorism case being conducted pursuant to the Attorney General's guidelines for FBI Foreign Intelligence Collection and Foreign Counterintelligence Investigations, there is no legal mechanism, e.g. subpoena, available to obtain these records.
<p>
<li><B>Fully Fund the FBI's "digital telephony" initiative to assure court-authorized law enforcement access for electronic surveillance to digitized communications</B>.  This proposal would appropriate funds to implement recent amendments to statutes governing secure telephone transmission (digital telephony). These amendments require telephone carriers to install and maintain sophisticated equipment which would permit law enforcement to continue to conduct legal electronic surveillance.
<p>
<li><B>Create and allocate funds for a special FBI counterterrorist and counterintelligence fund.</B> This proposal will fund costs associated cases which arise in connection with terrorism crises, including logistics and other support.
<p>
<li><B>Create an interagency Domestic Counterterrorism Center headed by the FBI.</B> This proposal will establish a partnership effort between the Justice Department, including the FBI, and other federal and state law enforcement authorities to coordinate efforts within the United States.
</ul>
<p>
<b>(3)  Conduct terrorism threat assessment of every federal facility in the country within the next 60 days</B>. The President has directed the Attorney General to conduct this assessment and report her recommendations in 60 days. The assessment has already begun.
<p>
<b>(4) Direct GSA to replace the federal building in Oklahoma City.</B>
<p>
<b>(5)  Direct the FBI Director, the Attorney General, and the National Security Adviser to prepare a Presidential Decision Directive authorizing any and all further steps necessary to combat foreign and domestic terrorism.</B>
<p>
<H3>II.	New Legislative Proposals</H3>

<B>(1) INVESTIGATIONS</B>
<ul>
<li><B>Hire approximately 1000 new agents, prosecutors, and other federal law enforcement and support personnel to investigate, deter, and prosecute terrorist activity.</B>
<p>
<li><B>Pass legislation to require, within 1 year, the inclusion of taggants in standard explosive device raw materials which will permit tracing of the materials post-explosion</B>. This proposal would require the inclusion of microscopic particles in certain raw materials, thereby permitting law enforcement to trace the source of the explosive even after a device has been detonated.
<p>
<li><B>Require the BATF to study and report on 1) the tagging of explosive materials for purposes of identification and detection; 2) whether common chemicals used to manufacture explosives can be rendered inert for use in explosives; and 3) whether controls can be imposed on certain precursor chemicals used to manufacture explosives.</B> In light of recent bombing incidents, there is a need to develop technologies that will make it possible to detect concealed explosives. Additionally, if bombings do take place, a means of providing some clues is needed to lead investigators to those responsible for the explosion. Moreover, since explosives can be manufactured using common agricultural and household materials, it is important to determine whether such materials can be manufactured in a manner so that their use in explosives is unlikely. Finally, the study would determine whether any reasonable controls can be placed on precursor chemicals, e.g., ammonium nitrate, which have many legitimate uses.
<p>
<li><B>Amend the Posse Comitatus Act to permit military participation in crime-fighting involving weapons of mass destruction.</B> This proposal would amend Federal Laws, which severely limit the role of the military in domestic law enforcement, to permit military participation in criminal cases involving chemical, biological, and other weapons of mass destruction; areas in which the military has specialized expertise.
<p>
<li><B>Amend the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1968 to constitutionally enhance use of electronic surveillance to fight terrorism. </B>This proposal would: permit any federal felony to be used as a basis for an electronic surveillance order; ease restrictions on the use, in American court proceedings, of information from electronic surveillance conducted by foreign governments; forbid suppression of electronic evidence unless law enforcement acted in bad faith in obtaining the evidence; authorize emergency electronic surveillance in situations involving threats by domestic terrorist organizations, authorize roving wiretaps where it is not practical to specify the number of the phone to be tapped, such as where a target uses multiple pay phones; allow the FBI to obtain records of local telephone calls, without the need for a court order, as they can own obtain records of long-diastase calls; and require telephone companies and/or service providers to preserve evidence until a court order could be obtained. None of these changes would alter the requirement for probable cause prior to engaging in electronic surveillance.
<p></ul>
<B>(2) PROSECUTION</B>
<p>
<ul>
<li><B>Amend Federal law to criminalize the use of all chemical weapons to include all forms of chemical weapons.</B> This bill would amend federal law to include chemical weapons in non-gaseous form. Under existing law, chemical weapons in gaseous form are covered, but those which are in liquid or solid form are not. Thus, for example, an individual who introduces dioxin in solid form into the water supply of a city would not be chargeable under current law.
<p>
<li><B>Make it illegal to possess explosives knowing that they are stolen.</B> This proposal would conform explosive laws to existing firearms statutes, making it a crime for an individual to possess explosives which the individual knows are stolen.
<p>
<li><B>Extend the Statute of limitations on the National Firearms Act to five (5) years.</B> This proposal would extend from three (3) to five (5) years the statute of limitations for prosecution for violations of the National Firearms Act, which deals with explosive and incendiary bombs. This change brings the statue of limitations for these offenses in line with similar criminal provisions.
<p>
<li><B>Provide the Secretary of Treasury authority to direct the use of Treasury Department aircraft to support emergency law enforcement situations.</B> This proposal would authorize the Secretary of Treasury to authorize the use of Treasury Department aircraft in support of emergency law enforcement crises.
<p>
<li><B>Amend reward statutes to reduce restrictions on making rewards.</B> This proposal would provide the Attorney General authority to pay a reward which is not subject to the spending limitations contained in 18 USC Sec. 3059 and 3072, provided that any reward of $100,000 or more may not be made without the approval of the President of the Attorney General, and such approval may not be delegated.
</ul>
<p>
<B>(3) PENALTIES</B>
<p>
<ul>
<li><B>Increase the penalty for anyone convicted of transferring a firearm or explosive knowing that it will be sue dot commit a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime.</B> This proposal will provide a mandatory penalty of not less than 10 years for any person who transfers a firearm knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that a firearm will be used to commit a crime of violence or drug-trafficking crime.
<p>
<li><B>Amend 18 USC Sec. 111 to provide enhanced penalties for all current and former Federal employees against terrorist attacks.</B> The existing statute only protects enumerated categories of current Federal employees. The proposed statute would provide enhanced penalties for crimes against all current and former Federal employees, and their immediate families, when the crime is committed because of the official duties of the federal employee. </ul>

<a name = "intro">Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:</a>
<p>
My name is Jerry Berman, Executive Director of the Center for Democracy and Technology.  The Center is pleased to have opportunity to address the subcommittee on one of the critical civil liberties issues of our day: the right to free speech, free association, and privacy on the Internet in the aftermath of Oklahoma City.  The Center for Democracy and Technology is an independent, non-profit public interest policy organization in Washington, DC. The Center's mission is to develop and implement public policies to protect and advance individual liberty and democratic values in new digital media. The Center achieves its goals through policy development, public education, and coalition building. 
<p>
<h3><a name ="overview">I. Overview: Shouting Fire in Cyberspace -- First Amendment Implications</a></h3>
<p>
The recent tragedy of Oklahoma City brings us here with questions and concerns about terrorist activity and constitutional rights on the Internet.  The Internet is a global network of networks that connects over twenty million users around the world.  Each day hundreds of thousands of documents and millions of electronic mail messages are exchanged through these interconnected computers.  
<p>	
Yes, there is information on the Internet about how to build bombs, reasons to overthrow the United States Government, and how to organize violent militia groups.  The question facing us, as an open society, is how to respond to the most controversial and extreme uses of this new technology, this electronic, global Gutenberg printing press that turns all citizens into publishers who can reach thousands and even millions of people around the country and the world.
<p>	
As an open society, governed by the democratic principles of the First and Fourth Amendments, we tolerate and even encourage robust debate, advocacy and exchange of information on all subjects and in all media of expression, without exception.  Prior restraint or any government action which might chill speech have long been labeled intolerable, expect in the few circumstances in which that speech advocates imminent violence and is likely to produce such violence.  Even in these cases, Constitutional law and long-standing law enforcement policy have dictated great restraint in order to avoid chilling legitimate speech activity.
<p>	
Justice Holmes taught that the First Amendment does not protect a person from punishment for "falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic,"  <i>Schenk v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52 (1919)</i>, but what does it mean to "shout fire" in cyberspace?  We believe that shouting fire in cyberspace is actually <b>far less threatening</b>, and thus less deserving of censure, than the equivalent act in the physical world.  Though one can shout fire in an email message or on an Internet newsgroup, the likelihood that it will incite readers to imminent, criminal action is much reduced because the readers are dispersed around the country, and even around the world.
<p>	
As interactive media such as the Internet become more and more common in public life, we will be challenged to revisit these basic issues about the difference between protected advocacy and truly dangerous action.  Articulating this line, over which government investigation and prosecution must not cross, requires faithfulness to the traditions of our open society and careful attention to the unique characteristics of this new medium.  Answering these questions is particularly important because the Internet is the site of new, vibrant political discourse and information.  Given the <a name = "bfn1">political character of communication in online environments, it is especially important that First Amendment activity and privacy rights be protected.  
<p>	
Indeed, in the face of terrorist threats, it is particularly important to maintain an open society in order to minimize public paranoia about the government and to discredit the arguments of those who advocate the destruction of our government.  The openness of the Internet and other interactive media should be seen as a great boon to our democracy, not as a threat to order.  A  noted scholar of terrorist behavior notes that:</a>
<p>
<blockquote>The U.S. has been remarkably free of political terrorism because the U.S. institutions for conflict resolution and justice redress, available to everyone, were believed to be working by and large in a satisfactory manner.<a href="#fn1">1</blockquote></a>
<p>
Following Oklahoma City, the debate over counterterrorism policy has presupposed that the openness of our society is at odds with the fight against domestic terrorists.  At least in the case of political advocacy on the Internet, we believe that a policy that promotes openness can help heal the paranoia and distrust of government and the political process by engaging the citizenry in a new political forum.
<p>	
The Center for Democracy and Technology believes that any prosecutorial or investigative activity must be predicated on speech <b>plus</b> a reasonable indication that the speech will lead to imminent violence.  Speech alone is not enough to prosecute or investigate in other media, and it should not be sufficient in interactive media.  Moreover, we assert that current law and the FBI's strict interpretation of the existing Attorney General investigative guidelines are adequate to serve both law enforcement purposes and First Amendment interests.
<p>
<h3><a name = "disc">II.	Political Discourse on the Net:  Democracy Flourishing Anew in Interactive Media</a></h3>
<p>
	To judge the Internet solely by the aspects of this new medium that have caught Congressional attention this year <a name = "bfn2">would lead to the belief that it is a haven for bomb-makers, militia members, racists, and purveyors of child pornography.  Yet this view of the Internet fails to account for the great democratic potential of interactive media, and the fact that a considerable degree </a>of political discussion, grass roots organizing, and political education takes place on the Internet today.  Indeed, if present usage patterns continue, we believe that  the Internet has the potential to revitalize political discourse by providing citizens with access to more detailed information about the political process and by creating a forum for political organizing that includes far more citizens in the political process than does the passive politics of television-based campaigning.<a href ="#fn2">2</a>.  This potential will be chilled if the medium is not properly protected from intrusion.
<p>	
As the popularity and accessibility of the Internet and commercial online services grows, and as the medium becomes easier to use, the political uses of the net are flourishing.  Political discourse is facilitated by a variety of different communications techniques available online, including newsgroups, mailing list discussion groups, chat sessions, and a host of electronic publishing capabilities.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Newsgroups:</b>  News groups are open, public areas in which users "post" articles and comments on a variety of subjects.  Usenet newsgroups accessible around the world on the Internet may be thought of as a hybrid of a newspaper, because of their broad reach, and community bulletin boards, because of their interactivity and ease of access.  Each newsgroup is devoted to a particular subject, from discussion of abortion, privacy rights, to the views of President Clinton and Rush Limbaugh.  Newsgroups are read by thousands or even millions of people, and any one who reads the group can also contribute to the discussion by posting his or her own comments. [See <a href = "#appendixB">Appendix B</a> for a list of politically-oriented newsgroups]
<p>
<li><b>Public mailing lists:</b>  Those who have an interest in exchanging information about a particular subject may also join a public mailing list on that subject.  Mailing lists enable all members to exchange electronic mail messages easily and allow others to join their discussions.  Unlike newsgroups, many mailing lists that are open to the public enable participants to obtain a list of those who are participating in the discussion.
<p>
<li><b>Private mailing lists:</b>  In some circumstances, an existing group of people will create a private mailing list to enable the group to discuss issues in private through the exchange of electronic mail.  These lists are considered closed to the public and the identity of each participant is generally known.
<p>
<li><b>Interactive chat services: </b> A variety of services are available to enable a group of people to engage in live, instantaneous communications.  These services might be characterized as conference calls, social gatherings, or town meetings in cyberspace.  As with mailing lists, the chat sessions may be either public or private.  The name or identity of each participant is generally known.
<p>
These services have been used to hold public conferences and discussion sessions on a variety of subjects from music to politics.  A geographically dispersed political group might well use interactive chat services to hold a meeting online.
<p>
<li><b>Electronic publishing: </b>The Internet is a revolutionary medium for delivering and receiving information inasmuch as distribution is rapid at a low cost compared to print publication.  Services such as the World Wide Web enable any individual or organization to quickly disseminate documents, images and even video to individuals all over the world.  
</ul><p>
	The Center for Democracy and Technology has found World Wide Web services critical to our own public education activities, and an increasing number of grass roots and community groups are coming to rely on the <a name = "bfn3">Internet to keep in touch </a> with members and constituents.  In fact, even some Senators offices are using the World Wide Web to communicate with and solicit feedback from constituents.<a href ="#fn3"> 3 </a> [See <a href = "#appendixA"> appendix A</a>for a list of politically-oriented World Wide Web sites.]
<p>
	Political groups left, right, and center are using the Internet to communicate, to organize, and to advocate their own views.  As a nation we should be encouraging political discourse in this new medium, because of its potential to raise the level of political discussion beyond the soundbite and to involve more citizens in the political process.  One aspect of encouraging political discourse in interactive media is to assure all users that their First Amendment and privacy rights will be respected fully.
<p>
<h3><a name = "limits">III.	Limits on Law Enforcement Activity in Pure Speech Environments Such as the Internet</a></h3>
<p>
All discussions and exchanges of information on the Internet are speech, and thus any proposal to criminalize or investigate such activity triggers a heightened degree of scrutiny.  The tradition of prosecutorial and investigative sensitivity in areas involving First Amendment activity is both long standing and well-founded in our democratic traditions.  We outline <a name = "bfn4">here the</a> restrictions<a name ="bfn5"> that have traditionally safeguarded</a> political activity from harmful, chilling government interference, and suggest ways in which their application to cyberspce poses unique, new questions.
<p>
In our preparation for this hearing, we have found information on how to construct bombs on the Internet.  Curiously, the most detailed information that we found comes from Internet sites located outside the United States.  The Terrorist Handbook, that contains information on how to make bombs similar to the one used in Oklahoma City, is available from a British World Wide Web site.<a href ="#fn4">4</a> And, information on how to make an atomic bomb can be found on a Swedish site.<a href ="#fn5">5</a>  
<p>
<ul><b>A.	Heightened standard for prosecution of crimes involving First Amendment rights</b></ul>
<p>
Even putting the problems of international criminal jurisdiction aside, we believe that the mere publication of these bomb manuals is protected by the First Amendment from criminal sanction.  Criminal prosecution of speech-related activity must withstand the two-pronged test established by the Supreme Court in <i>Brandenberg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444 (1969)</i>.  Advocacy may not be proscribed unless it 1) "is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action", and 2) that such advocacy is "likely to ... produce such action." Id. at 447.  Both the call to immediate criminal action and the likelihood that such a call will be heeded are necessary to justify prosecution.  Advocacy of violence alone is insufficient.  <i>Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298, 318 (1957)</i> (advocacy and teaching forcible overthrow of the government is immune from prosecution under the First Amendment).  Taken together, these cases form what is commonly referred to as the "speech plus" doctrine.  Some action or evidence of action beyond mere words must exist to justify a criminal  prosecution of political advocacy activity.  <i>Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 559, 563 (1965)</i>.  In <i>Cox</i>, the "plus" that justified prosecution of the advocacy in the course of a street demonstration was the imminent threat that the demonstrators would violently attack the county courthouse around which they were circling.  
<p>
Speech and advocacy on the Internet, unlike a street demonstration, are pure <a name = "bfn6">speech, with no immediate threat of physical violence</a>, in all of the circumstances that we can imagine.  As passionate and vehement as speech on the Internet may be, it remains only speech, with no immediate nexus to violence in most situations.  Unlike the crowded street in which demonstrators circle a building, no matter how incendiary the words sent over the Internet may be, they are still a long way from causing criminal harm.  Words sent over the Internet may inspire or incite, but the nexus between the words and subsequent action is far more attenuated than any case in which the Court has approved criminal sanction.  Thus, we believe that even if one publishes bomb-making instructions online, the second prong of Brandenberg is not satisfied.  There is no "plus" incident to the publication of a document that constitutes action likely to produce violence.<a href ="#fn6">6</a>  
<p>
<ul><b>B.	Tradition of special status for law enforcement investigations involving political groups and exercise of First Amendment rights</b></ul>
<p>
Further recognition of the sensitivity of law enforcement intrusion on First Amendment activities is found in the Attorney General's Guidelines governing investigation, infiltrations, and information collection involving First Amendment activities.  In response to several decades of law enforcement harassment of political organizations, these guidelines established the general principle that law enforcement may not interfere with political activity based solely on predicates drawn from the speech and advocacy activities of political groups.  As in the prosecutorial standard described above, something more than speech is required before <a name = "bfn7">investigations, infiltrations, or intrusive infiltration gathering </a>activities are commenced.
<p>
<ul><b>1.	Speech plus required to open an investigation</ul></b>
<p>

The Attorney General's Guidelines on General Crimes, Racketeering Enterprise and Domestic Security/Terrorism Investigations<a href = "#fn7">7</a> are in place in order to "encourage Agents of the FBI to perform their duties with greater certainty, confidence and effectiveness," and to "give the public firm assurance that the FBI is acting properly under the law."  This dual purpose guides the FBI toward the most effective investigative path, and assures the public that their free speech and privacy rights are fully respected.  Of particular relevance to this hearing are the guidelines as they relate to domestic security/terrorism investigations.  The guidelines state:
<p>
<blockquote>"A domestic security/terrorism investigation may be initiated when the facts or circumstances reasonably indicate that two or more persons are engaged in an enterprise for the purpose of furthering political or social goals wholly or in part through activities that involve force or violence and a violation of the criminal laws of the United States." p. 13.</blockquote>
<p>
These guidelines describe requirements for opening full investigations, and also, procedures and requirements for opening preliminary inquiries, which inclyde investigative activity where a full investigation in not necessary or not yet justified.
<p>
The Investigation Guidelines recognize all political activity as "sensitive" to undue law enforcement intrusion.  Two provisions exist to safeguard sensitive First Amendment activity from the chilling effect of improper intrusion.  
<ul>
<li><b>Speech plus predicate for a full investigation: </b>The Investigative Guidelines clearly state that a full investigation may not be commenced based "solely on activities protected by the First Amendment or on the lawful exercise of any other rights secured by the Constitution" if there is no "prospect of harm." p. 3.  
<p>
<li>Supervisory approval required for intrusion on political matters:  In the event that a full investigation or even merely a preliminary inquiry is to be opened involving "sensitive" matters, including the investigation of political groups, supervisory approval is required before proceeding. p. 4-5.
</ul><p>
<a hame = "bfn8">Given this tradition of forbearance in the case of </a>investigations of First Amendment-protected activity, we would expect that all investigations and preliminary inquires involving political activity on the Internet or other interactive media would be subject to the above requirements.
<p>
<ul><b>2.	Limitations on infiltrations</ul></b>
<p>
Historically, law enforcement infiltration of domestic political groups has been shown to be excessive and violative of individual's right to free association.  The Attorney General's Guidelines on FBI Use of Information and Confidential Sources<a href ="#fn8">8</a>  were issued in order to set reasonable limits on law enforcement's use of these techniques.  Like the Investigative Guidelines, the Infiltration Guidelines also recognize that extra care is needed when the use of these techniques implications First Amendment activities.  In assessing the appropriateness of a particular operation, the FBI must consider that risk of intrusion upon "lawful association of individuals or expression of ideas." p. 3, 11.  As with the Investigative Guidelines, supervisory approval is required for the use of an informant or confidential source who will "make use of formal or informal affiliation with an organization that is predominantly engaged in political activities." p. 11.  Furthermore, the FBI intrusion must be assessed in light of its potential to "hinder the ability of the organization to function." p. 11.  
<p>
Inasmuch as many of the political activities undertaken in interactive media involve group discussion and planning, concerns raised by the Guidelines are especially relevant to any law enforcement activity online.  We believe that this new medium raised many questions as to the proper role of law enforcement in light of these Guidelines.  For example:
<p>
<ul><li>Can law enforcement agents participate in online discussion groups?
<p>
We believe that it may be allowed under the guidelines for law enforcement agents to read Usenet newsgroups under certain circumstances, however we are gravely concerned that the Bureau should not train a large vacuum cleaner on the Internet for the purpose collecting masses of information as to the political views of individual citizens, especially where those citizens are in no nexus to any criminal activity.
<p>
<li>If so, must they announce their identity as law enforcement officers to the group?  If not, must they disclose their identity if asked?
<p>
Absent authorization for infiltration under the Justice Department's criminal investigation standard, we believe that law enforcement agents should certainly be required to identify themselves.</ul>
<p>
<ul><b>C.	First and Fourth Amendment nexus:  Protecting privacy rights to ensure First Amendment rights</ul></b>
<p>
	To encourage full political participation by all citizens requires that law enforcement respect individual privacy, as well as free speech rights.  For, if individuals feel that they may be investigated, tracked, or otherwise subject to government scrutiny merely for association with a particular political idea or group, then they may be less likely to vigorously participate in the political process.  The Court has long recognized the nexus between the First Amendment and Fourth Amendment privacy rights.  <i>United States v. United States District Court</i>, 407 U.S. 297 (1972)(warrantless wiretap not only violates Fourth Amendment, but also implicates the First Amendment).  Recognizing these concerns, the various Attorney General guidelines discussed above, as well as the Privacy Act, puts limits on the degree to which law enforcement may invade the privacy of individual and group political activity.
<p>	
In the absence of an authorized FBI inquiry or investigation, the Bureau is barred from maintaining any record on the First Amendment-protected activities of individuals. Section (e)(7) of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) provides that: "Each agency that maintains a system of records shall maintain no record describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about who the record is maintained or unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity."
<p>	
Congress included Subsection (e)(7) in the Act to reassure the American public that the FBI, CIA and the military would no longer have free reign to monitor and maintain files on the first amendment-protected activities of citizens.  The Senate Report on the bill explains that "[t]his section's restraint is aimed particularly at preventing collection of protected information, not immediately needed, about law-abiding Americans, on the off-chance that Government or the particular agency might possibly have to deal with them in the future."  (S.Rept. 93-1183) As Representative Abner Mikva pointed out  in hearings leading up to the passage of the Privacy Act: " The harm comes when the ordinary citizen feels he cannot engage in political activity without becoming a 'person of interest,' without having his name and photo place in a file colloquially, if not officially, labeled 'subversive.' " 
<p>	
In floor debate on the final wording of the section, the importance of protecting lawful speech was underscored: "[N]o records or files shall be kept on persons which are not within constitutional limitations... The rights of Americans to dissent in a lawful manner and for lawful purposes must be preserved." 
<p>	
In guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget in December, 1975, the (e)(7) prohibition was interpreted to bar the collection of information on individuals even if the information was published and considered publicly available, with the exception of standard bibliographic or library reference materials: "Collections of newspaper clippings or other published matter about an individual maintained other than in a conventional reference library would normally be a system of records [and thus subject to the Privacy Act]." 
<p>	
Further, a 1983 Justice Department memorandum intended to clarify the Privacy Act application to FBI collection of publicly available information concluded : "that unless the individual or group meets the standard for either a preliminary inquiry or a domestic security/terrorism investigation, collection of published materials, outside the library context, is barred." It is important to note, however, that the FBI guidelines state in the General Principles section that "Nothing in these guidelines is intended to prohibit the FBI from collecting and maintaining publicly available information consistent with the Privacy Act."
<p>	
An issue here is how the (e)(7) prohibition applies along the continuum of speech activities on the Internet.  Both the Privacy Act and the FBI guidelines were written before the development of the Internet.  A question exists as to whether, for instance, newsgroup communications are to be publicly available information for purposes of collection by the FBI. 
<p>
<h3><a name = "rec">IV.	Recommendations</a></h3>
<p>
In conclusion, we want to commend Chairman Specter and this subcommittee for your diligence in addressing this very important issue.  We close with the following recommendations:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Don't criminalize pure speech:</b>  Our First Amendment traditions and long-standing law enforcement policy teach that criminal sanctions are only appropriate for "speech plus" some criminal or likely violent action.  
<p>
<li><b>Maintain cautious interpretation of Attorney General's guidelines in online investigations:  </b>Cautious interpretations of the current guidelines leave the FBI plenty of room to investigate genuine threats and provide the citizenry reassurance that their political activities, even where controversial, are not subject to government scrutiny and intrusion.
<p>
<li><b>Start of dialogue on the proper role of law enforcement in policing the online world: </b>We hope that this hearing is the first step in a process that establishes, based on a broad public dialogue, how law enforcement can be expected to function in the new online environment.
<p>
One venue for such a dialogue is the legislation (S.714) that Senator Leahy has introduced, calling for a study of proper legal responses to violence, hate speech, and sexually-explicit material in interactive media.  We commend Senator Leahy for his leadership on this issue, and are grateful to Senator Kohl for his co-sponsorship of the Leahy study.  We have also been in discussions with this subcommittee about the study, and look forward to working with you.
<p>
<li><b>Treat proposals to expand surveillance authority with great caution:</b>  In the wake of the Oklahoma City tragedy, law enforcement and the Administration is proposing dramatic changes to federal wiretap authority including new roving tap powers and the use of any federal criminal statute as the predicate for wiretaps in terrorism investigations.  Just last year, the Congress enacted changes to wiretap law in the Digital Telephony bill.  The changes now sought were not raised in the context of last years bill and there is no indication that any of the changes sought this year are justified by new circumstances.
<p>
Though these issues are beyond the scope of today's hearing, we do want to note for the record that we are very concerned about expansion in roving tap authority, additions to the list of predicate crimes for electronic surveillance, as well as other records access provisions proposed in various counterterrorism bills now before both houses of Congress.
</ul>
<p>
Again, we thank the Chair for the opportunity to appear before you on this very important issue and are ready and willing to work with you on these critical civil liberties issues affecting interactive media.

<P>
<H2>Terrorism Law Is Major Setback for Civil Liberties</H2></CENTER>

In a major blow to the Bill of Rights, Congress has passed and President
Clinton on April 24 signed the anti-terrorism bill, Pub. L.104-132.  The
new law, which took effect upon signing -
<UL>
<LI>Guts habeas corpus, the &quot;Great Writ&quot; by which federal courts
have granted relief from violations of the Bill of Rights in state court
criminal proceedings.  Perhaps the single worst part of the bill, this has
nothing to do with terrorism, since it involves the standards for federal
review of state court rulings, and terrorism cases are almost always tried
in federal, not state courts. Rather, it is the culmination of a decades-long
effort to end meaningful federal constitutional review of the procedures
by which death sentences are imposed in the states.  The essence of the
changes is a provision requiring federal courts to overlook many instances
where state courts failed to adhere strictly to the U.S. Constitution, even
in cases going to the basic fairness of the trial or the guilt of the accused.
 The Supreme Court has already taken up a case that presents questions as
to the effect of the habeas changes.  Oral argument was June 3 and a decision
may come before July.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Makes it a crime for U.S. citizens to provide any material support to
the lawful political or humanitarian activities of any foreign group designated
by the Secretary of State as &quot;terrorist.&quot;  It was already a federal
crime to support the violent activities of terrorists.  Banks in the U.S.,
facing fines of $50,000, must freeze the assets of any domestic organization
or U.S. citizen believed to be an agent of a designated group.  The provision
does not specify how the banks identify the domestic &quot;agents&quot;
of  terrorist groups, nor does it provide any mechanism for a domestic organization
to get its funds unfrozen.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Denies visas to foreigners visiting the U.S. based on mere membership
in groups designated as terrorist by the Secretary of State. Denying visas
based on membership and not on terrorist activity represents a return to
the discredited ideological exclusions standard of the McCarran-Walter Act.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Creates a special court that will use secret evidence to deport U.S.
residents or visitors suspected of being members of terrorist groups.  The
classified evidence  will be presented to the judge but the alien will be
provided only a summary of the evidence.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Severely curtails the ability to claim political asylum, by requiring
an undocumented alien entering the U.S. to be immediately sent back to the
country he is fleeing unless he can prove, at the border inspection point,
a credible fear of political persecution.  Refugees would not have time
to obtain legal representation, and the on-the-spot determination of the
INS officer would not be reviewable in court.   Recently, while considering
an otherwise terrible immigration bill, the Senate voted to repeal this
provision; the fate of the repeal is now in the hands of the immigration
conferees, as the House-passed bill has no comparable repeal  provision.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Deprives aliens of due process rights if they entered the U.S. without
inspection.  Again, this provision has nothing to do with terrorism.  It
is an effort to strip aliens facing deportation of the due process they
have long been granted.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Opens the door once again to politically focused investigations like
the flawed CISPES probe, by repealing the Edwards amendment, a provision
enacted less than two years ago, which barred the FBI, when investigating
the crime of material support for terrorism, from opening investigations
based solely on activities protected under the First Amendment.
</UL>
For more information on the provisions summarized above, <A HREF="cnss.cti.anal.html">see
the memo</A> posted below, which CNSS prepared in 1995 when the bill was
first introduced.<BR>
<BR>
A few objectionable provisions sought by the President having to do with
wiretaps were dropped but these would have been incremental in their effect
compared to the radical changes that were adopted.<BR>
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Designation of Terrorist Groups -- <BR>
An Inherently Political Decision with Wide-Reaching Consequences</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>Under the new law, the Secretary of State is authorized to designate
certain foreign entities as &quot;terrorist organizations&quot;.  Three
sets of consequences flow from the Secretary of State&iacute;s decsion to
designate a foreign entity as a terrorist organization: (1) it is a crime
for anybody in this country to contribute money or other material support
to the activities, including the legal social, political and humanitarian
activities of the group; (2) all members of the group are ineligible for
visas, even if they have never been involved in illegal activities: and
(3) the government can use secret evidence to deport alleged members of
such groups.<BR>
<BR>
The new law allows the decision of the Secretary of State to designate a
group as terrorist to be based on classified evidence, and if challenged
in court, the Secretary of State's decision can be defended on the basis
of secret evidence.<BR>
The government admits that some of the groups it will designate are broad-based
organizations engaged  in both lawful social, political and humanitarian
activities as well as violent activities.  The law already provided that
individuals who have engaged, or are likely to engage, in terrorist activities
are to be excluded and deported from the U.S.<BR>
<P><CENTER><B>McCarran-Walter Ideological Exclusions Reemerge;<BR>
First Amendment Rights of Americans at Stake</B></CENTER>
<P>The First Amendment grants Americans the right to receive information
and ideas, especially ideas the government finds objectionable.  This First
Amendment right includes the receipt of information from abroad.  One highly
effective way of transmitting information remains the personal encounter,
through speeches, conferences and meetings.  The immigration law sets the
standards both for excluding aliens from permanent admission and making
them ineligible for visas for temporary visits.  Rendering a category of
aliens &quot;excludable&quot; on ideological grounds means that they cannot
come here even temporarily to speak or engage in other activities implicating
the First Amendment rights of U.S. citizens.<BR>
<BR>
Less than six years ago, Congress repealed the ideological exclusion provisions
of the McCarran-Walter Act, which had barred foreigners from obtaining visas
to visit the U.S. based on their political activities and associations.
 Since adoption of the Immigration Act of 1990, foreigners can be denied
visas based on their own acts, not based on beliefs, advocacy or associations
that would be protected under the First Amendment if engaged in by a person
within the U.S.  Foreigners seeking to visit the U.S. to speak or lecture
can be barred if there is reason to believe that they had engaged or would
engage in the U.S. in criminal conduct.  This reform, a major victory for
CNSS and the Free Trade in Ideas coalition, is now being reversed.  The
terrorism bill amends the Immigration Act to exclude any alien who is a
member of a group designated by the Secretary of State as terrorist, even
if the individual had only participated in the group's political or humanitarian
activities.<BR>
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>Provisions of the omnibus terrorism law will almost certainly be subject
to judicial challenge on constitutional grounds.  For now, the law represents
the worst setback for civil liberties in many years.<BR>

<CENTER>  <H3>Clinton Terrorism Legislation Threatens Constitutional Rights</H3></CENTER>
<p>
<p>   
On February 10, 1995, a counterterrorism bill drafted by the
Clinton Administration was introduced in the Senate as S. 390 and
in the House of Representatives as H.R. 896.
<p>
The Clinton bill is a mixture of: provisions eroding
constitutional and statutory due process protections, selective
federalization -- on political grounds -- of state crimes (minus
state due process rules), discredited ideas from the Reagan and
Bush Administrations, and the extension of some of the worst
elements of crime bills of the recent past.
<p>
The legislation would:
<p>
<ol>
<li>authorize the Justice Department to pick and choose
crimes to investigate and prosecute based on political beliefs
and associations;
<p>
<li>repeal the ancient provision barring the U.S. military
from civilian law enforcement;
<p>
<li>expand a pre-trial detention scheme that puts the burden
of proof on the accused;
<p>
<li>loosen the carefully-crafted rules governing federal
wiretaps, in violation of the Fourth Amendment;
<p>
<li>establish special courts that would use secret evidence
to order the deportation of persons convicted of no crimes, in
violation of basic principles of due process;
<p>
<li>permit permanent detention by the Attorney General of
aliens convicted of no crimes, with no judicial review;
<p>
<li>give the President unreviewable power to criminalize
fund-raising for lawful activities associated with unpopular
causes;
<p>
<li>renege on the Administration's approval in the last
Congress of a provision to insure that the FBI would not
investigate based on First Amendment activities; and
  <p>   
<li>resurrect the discredited ideological visa denial
provisions of the McCarran Walter Act to bar foreign speakers.
<p></ol>
Once again, the impatience of those charged with upholding
the Constitution has led them to seek authority to circumvent it.
<p>
The U.S. has not been a fertile breeding ground for
terrorism.  Part of the reason lies in the values at the core of
our unique system of governance -- diversity, religious and
ethnic tolerance, acceptance of change, openness to new ideas,
constitutional limits on government discretion, reliance on legal
proceedings open to public scrutiny.  These values make it hard
to nurture in the U.S. the ethnic or religious hatred that fuels
much terrorism.  Unfortunately, these values would be undermined
by this legislation. 
<p>
<b><ul>1. Use of Secret Evidence to Deport Aliens Not Charged with Criminal Activity</ul></b>
<p>
Title II is a slightly modified version of a proposal first
made during the Bush Administration, which Congress twice refused
to enact.  The changes made by the Clinton Administration do not
cure the essence of the proposal: it would create a special court
to hear secret evidence against aliens whom the government wishes
to deport.
<p>
It is important to recognize at the outset that the
provision applies only to aliens who are not charged with any
crime.  If any person found in this country was suspected of
committing a crime, especially a terrorist crime, that person
would be arrested and put on trial here or extradited to a
country where he could stand trial.  This provision is designed
to allow the government to deport persons who are deemed
undesirable because of their political associations and beliefs.
<p>
For the government to take adverse action against an
individual based on secret evidence is the antithesis of American
jurisprudence and a fundamental due process violation.
<p>
Aside from the Star Chamber concept that is at the core of
this provision, it has many other extraordinary features, among
them the following:  
<p>
<B>Use of Illegally Obtained Evidence. </B> The provision states:
"Nor shall such alien have the right to seek suppression of
evidence."  Repealing the exclusionary rule eviscerates the
Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and
seizure.
<p>
<B>Exemption from FISA Standards.</B>  The Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act has a meticulously crafted set of procedures
intended to balance the rights of individuals against the
national security.  Those procedures include a requirement that
the government give the defendant notice when it intends to use
information from a FISA wiretap and allow the defendant to move
to suppress the evidence if it was obtained illegally.  The bill
would make such provisions, which have worked fine in the most
serious espionage cases, inapplicable in alien deportation cases. 
<p>     
<B>Permanent detention</B>.  If no country is willing to receive an
alien ordered deported under the new provisions, the bill states
that "the Attorney General may, notwithstanding any other
provision of law, retain the alien in custody. ... Any alien in
custody pursuant to this subsection shall be released from
custody solely at the discretion of the Attorney General."
<p>
<B>Appeals only in D.C.. </B> In what appears to be either forum-
shopping or an effort to impose additional costs on aliens
fighting deportation, the bill would allow appeals from
deportation proceedings only to the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, forcing attorneys
from all over the country to come to Washington.
<p>
<B>Guilt by Association.  </B>The legislation subtly but critically
rewrites the definition of engaging in terrorist activity in the
Immigration and Nationality Act, which serves as the basis for
the exclusion of aliens seeking entry and the deportation of
aliens already in this country.
<p>
The current law defines "to engage in terrorist activity" to
cover someone who "affords material support to any individual,
organization, or government in conducting a terrorist activity."
The revised definition would read: "affords material support to
an individual, organization, or government which the actor knows
or reasonably should know has committed or plans to commit
terrorist activity."  The change would remove the current law's
requirement that there be a nexus between the material support
and the terrorist activity, thereby allowing exclusion and
deportation of any alien who had supported the peaceful, legal
activities of a group that engaged, or had subgroups that
engaged, in illegal acts.  The "has committed" language would
even seem to sweep in those who support groups that once
committed but have now foresworn terrorism.  
<p>
<B>Guilt by Association, Part II. </B> The bill would resurrect the
discredited ideological tests of the McCarran Walter Act for
denying foreign visitors visas to come to speak in the U.S. 
While the Immigration Act of 1990 authorized the denial of visas
to persons who had engaged in terrorist activities, this bill
would deny visas to all representatives or spokespersons for
groups labeled terrorist, even if the representative or
spokesperson had never engaged in any illegal activity.  This
test would have allowed the exclusion of representatives of the
African National Congress or the IRA or many other political
groups, even if they were seeking to enter the U.S. to talk about
prospects for peace.  
<p>     
<B>Continued Exclusion of PLO Representatives.</B>  Even after
Yassar Arafat has been received at the White House, where he
signed a peace accord with Israel, he and every other alien who
is a representative of the PLO is "considered, for purposes of
this Act, to be engaged in a terrorism activity." 
<p>
<B>Son of Star Chamber.</B>  Section 202(d) of the bill seems to
authorize a mini-Star Chamber proceeding, allowing the use of
classified information in any deportation case, even those where
the complex provisions of the alien terrorist removal section are
not invoked.
<p>
<b><ul>2.   Terrorist Fund-Raising Is Whatever the President
                 Decides It Is and Nobody Can Question His Decision</ul></b>
<p>
Title III of the bill creates a new federal crime of
"terrorist fund-raising."  The provision would allow the
President to define the crime by designating certain groups as
terrorist organizations.  The President can also designate
individual persons who are raising funds for, or acting for or on
behalf of, any organization he designates.  From then on, it is a
crime for "any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United
States anywhere, to directly or indirectly, raise, receive or
collect on behalf of, or furnish, give, transmit, transfer or
provide funds to or for an organization or person" so designated,
unless a license has been granted by the Secretary of the
Treasury. 
<p>
In an attempt to avoid judicial review of designations that
are either arbitrary or politically motivated, the legislation
states that the President's designation of a group or individual
would be final.  "Any finding made in any designation pursuant to
[this section] shall be conclusive.  No question concerning the
validity of the issuance of such designation may be raised by the
defendant in a criminal prosecution as a defense or as an
objection to any trial or hearing."  Introducing a further
opportunity for biased or inconsistent decisions, the legislation
allows the President to take an organization or person off the
list whenever he decides that "the national security, foreign
relations, or economic interests of the United States so
warrant," even though the organization is still involved in
terrorist activity.  
<p>
The new crime adopts by reference the definition of
terrorist activity in the Immigration and Nationality Act.  That
definition states that a terrorist organization means any
organization engaged, or which has a significant subgroup which
engages, in terrorism activity, regardless of any legitimate
activities conducted by the organization or its subgroups. 
<p>
The fundraising provisions are unconstitutional because they
violate the fundamental principle of our constitutional law that
"a blanket prohibition of association with a group having both
legal and illegal aims," without a showing of specific intent to
further the unlawful aims of the group, is an unconstitutional
infringement on "the cherished freedom of association protected
by the First Amendment."  Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U.S. 11
(1966).  As the Supreme Court emphasized in Noto v. United
States, 364 U.S. 290, 299-300 (1961), "There is a danger that one
in sympathy with the legitimate aims of . . . an organization,
but not specifically intending to accomplish them by resort to
violence, might be punished for his adherence to lawful and
constitutionally protected purposes, because of other and
unprotected purposes which he does not necessarily share."   
<p>
     <ul><b>3.   A New Federal Crime of Terrorism to Be Applied
          Selectively Based on the Political Motivation of the
          Offender </ul></b>
<p>
Section 101 of the bill creates a new federal crime of
international terrorism in the United States.  Terrorist activity
should be a crime.  It already is a crime.  Section 101 does not
criminalize anything that is not already a crime.  The new
offense is defined as any killing, kidnapping, maiming, assault
resulting in serious bodily injury, or assault with a deadly
weapon, and any damage to any real or personal property "in
violation of the laws of any State or the United States," so long
as one of 9 jurisdictional bases is met.
<p>
Since the new offense does not cover anything that is not
already a crime, the main purpose of the proposal seems to be to
avoid certain constitutional and statutory protections that would
otherwise apply.  Investigations of, and prosecutions for, the
new crime would be subject to the following special rules:   
<p>
<B>Suspension of posse comitatus. </B> The new subsection (f)
provides a wholesale exemption from one of the oldest protections
in American law, the separation between military and police
functions.  At a time when there is growing public concern about
the militarization of law enforcement, subsection (f) provides
that "Assistance may be requested from any Federal ... agency,
including the Army, Navy and Air Force, any statute, rule or
regulation to the contrary notwithstanding."
<p>
<B>Avoiding state due process protections. </B> The federal rules
of criminal procedure are in certain respects outdated compared
to state court rules.  For example, many states have rejected the
concept of trial by surprise, adopting instead rules that require
the prosecution to disclose its evidence to the defense in
advance of trial, and vice versa.  This facilitates plea
bargaining and ensures that both sides are better prepared so the
trial, if there is one, runs more smoothly.  By contrast, under
federal law, a defense lawyer is entitled to see prior statements
made to police by a witness against his client only after the
witness testifies at trial.  There is increasing discussion of
modernizing this federal rule.  
<p>
In contrast to this trend, the draft adopts a tactic that
state and federal prosecutors have jointly pursued to circumvent
state procedural rules.  Subsection (g) provides that in any
prosecution under the section, "only the elements of state law,
and not any provisions pertaining to criminal procedure, are
adopted."  This allows state prosecutors, dissatisfied with the
rules of their own state, to take certain cases to federal
prosecutors in order to obtain the benefit of rules that make it
harder to mount an effective defense.   
<P>
<B>Chipping away at the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. </B> In
derogation of the Fifth Amendment's presumption of innocence and
the Sixth Amendment right to bail, Subsection 101(d) of this bill
provides that anyone accused of committing a crime thereunder is
presumed to be ineligible for bail and may be detained pretrial. 
The accused bears the burden of rebutting the presumption.  (This
is a significant expansion of a provision that first appeared in
1984, when Congress adopted 18 USC 3142(e), shifting to the
defendant in certain drug cases the burden of proving pretrial
that he is eligible for the constitutional right to bail.)   
<P>
<B> Loosening the rules on wiretaps.</B>  Subsection (e) would
exempt terrorism cases from the carefully crafted and balanced
standards developed in 1986 for so-called "roving taps."  When
Congress adopted the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of
1986, it struck a careful balance between privacy and law
enforcement.  Because of the Fourth Amendment's specificity
requirement, federal law has always required applicants for
wiretap orders to specify the location to be tapped.  Some
criminals were attempting to evade surveillance by using pay
phones, the location of which could not always be anticipated for
inclusion in the wiretap application.  Therefore, Congress in
1986 created a limited exception to the specificity requirement
where the target of an investigation has been taking steps to
thwart interception by changing facilities.  This bill would
dispense with that standard, allowing roving taps to be used
anytime a person is suspected of being involved in a terrorist
crime, regardless of the law's requirement that there be a basis
for the roving tap authority.  
<p>
<B>Mandatory jail sentence. </B> The new subsection 2332b(d) would
provide that no person convicted of a violation under the new
crime could be placed on probation.  While it is reasonable that
persons who commit violent crimes would be incarcerated, the new
section is not limited to violent offenses.  Someone who
intentionally scratches the car of a foreign diplomat would go to
jail if charged and convicted under this provision.  This gives
prosecutors, who decide whether to charge under this section or
another section, a tremendous club to hold over the heads of
minor offenders.
<p>
<B>Threats</B>   Under the proposed statute, threatening to do
anything violent is a crime itself.  There are numerous federal
threat statutes already on the books (bomb threats, threats
against the President), but there is no general threat statute. 
Under this bill, threatening to hit a tourist would be a federal
crime, which could be investigated and prosecuted without
adherence to constitutional and statutory protections.
<P>
<B>First Amendment dangers.</B>  It is unlikely, of course, that
ordinary crimes against tourists would be prosecuted under this
section.  The question of how cases will be selected for
investigation and prosecution under such a broad statute brings
us to the nub of the threat it poses.  Proposed new section
2332b(e) provides that no indictment could be brought unless the
Justice Department certifies that the offense appeared to have
been intended to intimidate or retaliate against a government or
population.  So the cases will be chosen based on the offender's
political motives, known or suspected.   
<P>
Selecting offenders for prosecution based on their politics
is fraught with danger to the First Amendment, especially where
ordinary constitutional and statutory guarantees are
circumvented.  The problem is further exacerbated here, where
motive is not an element of the crime to be proved at trial but
an unreviewable prosecutorial determination. 
<P>
Worse than the prosecutorial concerns are the investigative
implications of the legislation.  Encompassing as it does
attempts, threats and conspiracies, and read in conjunction with
the extraterritorial provisions in sections 102 and 103 and the
fund-raising provisions in Title III, this legislation is a
general charter for the FBI to investigate political groups and
causes at will.  
<p>
Indeed, the Administration is quite explicit about its
intention to investigate based on First Amendment activities.  In
section 601 of the bill, it seeks to repeal a seemingly modest
provision (the "Edwards amendment") agreed to by the
Administration only 6 months ago and enacted in last year's crime
bill that prohibited investigations of "material support" based
on activities protected by the First Amendment.  The
Administration now claims that this provision imposes "an
unprecedented and impractical burden on law enforcement
concerning the initiation and continuation of criminal
investigations" and asks for its repeal.  The amendment in fact
was intended to merely codify the criminal standard in the Smith
guidelines.
<p>  
<B>Equal protection violation. </B> One of the jurisdictional bases
set forth in the new provision is that any alleged offender is an
alien.  While the federal government has broader discretion than
the states in making distinctions between citizens and aliens,
providing different crimes for aliens and citizens would surely
seem to violate the Constitution.

<p>
<p>
        <CENTER><H3>The FBI's Domestic Counterterrorism Program</H3></CENTER>
<p>
 Recent news commentary has suggested that the FBI is
hamstrung in its efforts to combat domestic terrorism.  One
former FBI official was quoted as saying that "you have to wait
until you have blood on the street before the Bureau can act." 
Steven Emerson has asserted that the FBI is severely restricted
in infiltrating known extremist groups, that it has no terrorism
data base like the CIA's, and that it is powerless to stop
extremist groups from masquerading as "religious" groups.
<p>
All of these claims are incorrect.  Persons concerned about
addressing the threat of terrorism need to begin with a clear
understanding of current FBI capabilities, which are in fact
broad.
<P>
<ul><b>Attorney General Guidelines</B></ul>
<p>
The FBI currently operates under a set of guidelines issued
in 1983 by Ronald Reagan's Attorney General, William French
Smith.  The Smith guidelines were a modification of guidelines
issued by Gerald Ford's Attorney General Edward Levi in 1976. 
The Levi guidelines were criticized as being too restrictive and
cumbersome.  Indeed, many of the criticisms of the current
guidelines are really the same criticisms lodged against the Levi
guidelines, which the Smith guidelines were intended to rectify.
<p>
The Smith guidelines make it absolutely clear that the FBI
does not have to wait for blood in the streets before it can
investigate a terrorist group.  The guidelines expressly state: 
"In its efforts to anticipate or prevent crimes, the FBI must at
times initiate investigations in advance of criminal conduct."
<p>
The threshold for opening a full investigation is low: a
domestic security/terrorism investigation may be opened whenever 
"facts or circumstances reasonably indicate that two or more
persons are  engaged in an enterprise for the purpose of
furthering political or social goals wholly or in part through
activities that involve force or violence and a violation of the
criminal laws of the United States."
<p>
Indeed, the FBI is also authorized to open a preliminary
inquiry on an even lower threshold:  The Bureau can begin
investigating when it receives any information or allegation
"whose responsible handling requires some further scrutiny." 
Preliminary inquiries can be conducted without headquarters
approval for 90 days, during which the FBI can conduct
interviews, contact confidential sources and previously
established informants, and carry out physical surveillance. 
Preliminary inquiries can be extended with Headquarters approval.
<p>
    <ul><b>Advocacy</b></ul>
<p>
One of the main purposes of the Smith guidelines was to make
it clear that the FBI could open an investigation based on
advocacy of violence.  While urging respect for the First
Amendment, the guidelines state: "When, however, statements
advocate criminal activity or indicate an apparent intent to
engage in crime, particularly crimes of violence, an
investigation under these guidelines may be warranted ... ."
<p>
     <ul><b>How do the Guidelines work in practice?</b></ul>
<p>
In any given year, the FBI engages in approximately two
dozen full domestic terrorism investigations.  Over the years
since the Smith guidelines were adopted, nearly two thirds of
these full investigations were opened before a crime had been
committed.  The FBI has investigated right-wing, anti-government,
anti-tax, paramilitary and militia groups under this authority. 
The FBI's characterization of White American Resistance (WAR) is 
typical: After opening a domestic terrorism investigation of WAR,
the FBI stated "No known acts of violence have as yet been
attributed to WAR; however, leaders of the group have been
encouraging members to arm themselves."
<p>
The FBI has been successful in preventing terrorist crimes
before they occurred.  In 1993, for example, the FBI arrested
several skinheads in Los Angeles after a lengthy investigation
determined that they has been discussing and planning attacks on
a black church, Jewish targets and other religious targets.
<p>
Calling something a church or a religious organization does
not immunize it from investigation.  In fact, a number of the
white supremacist groups investigated by the FBI had assumed a
religious mantle, under the "Christian Identity" philosophy.  The
FBI investigated under the terrorism guidelines the Yahweh
Church, a militant black group in Miami, and other religious
groups.   
<p>
Nothing in law or logic prohibits the FBI from opening
investigations based on public source material or reports from
private civil rights groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center. 
The FBI opens investigations based on any credible source,
including news reports.  For example, the FBI opened a civil
rights investigation into the Rodney King case as soon as
officials saw the broadcast of the videotape.  And the Justice
Department has met with abortion rights activists to solicit
information about groups that may be planning attacks on abortion
clinics.  
<p>
    <ul><b>Terrorist Information System</b></ul>
<p>
The FBI has a state of the art, on-line computer database
known as the Terrorist Information System containing information
on suspected terrorist groups and individuals.  The system has
over 200,000 individuals and over 3000 organizations or
enterprises.  The individuals indexed include not only subjects
of investigations but also known or suspected members of
terrorist groups, associates, contacts, victims and witnesses. 
The organizations or enterprises include not only terrorist
groups but also affiliated organizations or enterprises.  TIS
allows the FBI to rapidly retrieve information and to make links
between persons, groups or events.  
<p>
<ul><b>Issues to Be Considered</b></ul>
<p>
There appears to be a growing problem of disaffected loners
who cut themselves off from all groups.  An increased effort to
monitor anti-government groups is unlikely to identify these
loners, who may pose the greatest threat.  In this context, the
enterprise concept that serves as the basis of the Smith
guidelines -- and that serves as the basis for calls for greater
infiltration of groups -- may be irrelevant.

<title>Recent Trends in Domestic and International Terrorism</title>

<p>
<p>
<CENTER><H3>Recent Trends in Domestic and International Terrorism   </H3></CENTER>
<p>
On February 10, 1995, a counterterrorism bill drafted by the
Clinton Administration was introduced in the Senate as S. 390 and
in the House of Representatives as H.R. 896.  The legislation
poses serious threats to constitutional rights.
<p>
Terrorism is a serious problem, and calls for a serious
response founded on a clear and accurate assessment of the facts. 
In the past, the Administration and Congress have found it highly
relevant to look at the numbers and trends of terrorist incidents
as a predicate for policy decisions.  
<p>
The Administration's proposal begins with nearly eight pages
of "findings" that omit some key facts: that terrorism in the
United States, especially terrorism of international origin, is
rare, and that terrorism abroad, including terrorism against
Americans abroad, continues to decline.
<p>
 <ul><B>1.   International Terrorism in the U.S.</B></ul>
 <p>
According to reports published by the FBI, in the past
eleven years, there have been two international terrorist
incidents in the United States.   (An international terrorist
incident is defined by the FBI as one committed by a group or
individual that is foreign-based and/or directed by countries or
groups outside the United States or whose activities transcend
national boundaries.)  One of the two incidents was the notorious
and highly destructive World Trade Center bombing in February
1993.  The other was not even directed against the U.S. and is
hard to characterize as a serious incident: in April 1992, five
opponents of the Iranian regime occupied the offices of the
Iranian Mission to the United Nations in New York City.  The five
pled guilty and were sentenced to three months in jail.  
<P>
<ul><B>2.   Domestic Terrorism in the U.S. </B></ul> 
<p>
Last year (1994), there were no terrorist incidents in the
United States, according to statistics maintained by the FBI. 
There were no preventions of terrorist incidents in the United
States.   There was one set of suspected terrorist incidents,
involving improvised explosive devices discovered at two
locations in New York.  The devices, which did not detonate, were
accompanied by notes criticizing the government of Israel as
being too liberal, signed by the Maccabee Squad and the Shield of
David.  The case remains unsolved to date.
<p>
In 1993, there were 11 domestic terrorist incidents in the
U.S.  Nine of the eleven all occurred on a single night when
animal rights activists placed small incendiary devices in four
Chicago department stores that sell furs.  (According to the FBI,
the most active domestic "terrorist" groups in recent years have
been animal rights activists and "skinheads".)
<p>
In recent years, the number of terrorist incidents in the
U.S., according to the FBI, is as follows:
<p>
<pre>
                       Actual   Prevented  Suspected 
               1994      0          0         1
               1993     12          7         2                  
               1992      4          0         0
               1991      5          4         1       
               1990      7          5         1
               1989      4          7        16
</pre>
<p>
As noted above, all but one of the incidents under "Actual" were
domestic in nature.
<p>
<ul><B>3.   International Terrorism is On the Decline; Lethality of
          Incidents Rises</B></ul>
<p>
There have been two trends in international terrorism:
incidents have been declining, while the lethality of incidents
has been increasing.   
<p>
After reaching a peak in 1987, international terrorist
incidents have been declining, according to statistics collected
and published by the U.S. Department of State.  In 1992, the 
State Department recorded a total of 364 terrorist incidents
worldwide, down from the 666 recorded in 1987.  In 1993, total
incidents increased to 427, but were it not for a series of
coordinated incidents, the level of terrorism would have fallen
in 1993 as well: the increase in 1993 over 1992 was caused by a
campaign of 150 attacks carried out by the Kurdistan Workers
Party against Turkish interests in Western Europe on two separate
days, in June and November, with about 75 attacks each day.  
<p>
In 1994, the number of terrorist incidents worldwide fell
again, to 321, according to preliminary statistics available from
the State Department.
<p> 
According to the State Department, anti-U.S. attacks fell to
88 in 1993, down from 142 in 1992.  Anti-U.S. attacks fell again
in 1994, to 66.  By comparison, in 1986, there were 204 attacks
against Americans.
<p>
According to the U.S. State Department, about 21% of world
terror is targeted at the U.S.  
<p>
In 1993, 109 people were killed and 1,393 were wounded in
terrorist incidents worldwide, the highest casualty total in five
years.  Six of those killed and nearly a thousand of those
wounded were Americans, all as a result of The World Trade Center
bombing.  Prior to that, the most deadly attack against Americans
was the downing of Pan Am 103 in 1988, in which 189 Americans
were killed.  In 1992, 2 Americans were killed and 1 was wounded
in terrorist incidents.  In 1991, there were 7 American
fatalities and 14 other casualties.  In 1990, 12 Americans were
killed and 11 injured in incidents worldwide.  
<p>
Administration officials and terrorism experts have cited
several reasons for the trend.  In December 1994, the State
Department's coordinator for counter-terrorism said that
international terrorism was declining because of the Middle East
peace process, the firm policies of the U.S and other 
governments, and the fall of the Soviet Union, which had provided
support for terrorist organizations.
<p>
In June 1994, the State Department's director for regional
counter-terrorism affairs stated, "Terrorist activity is at a
more manageable level now."  
<p>
"Clearly, there has been a very, very sharp reduction in
what we used to call state-sponsored terrorism," said Robert B.
Oakley, the retired career foreign service officer who had served
as director of the Office of Combatting Terrorism in the Reagan
administration, in a news story that appeared in September 1994.

<H3>I.	Overview</H3>
The first organizational meeting of the Internet Freedom Network was held
in Toronto, Canada on May 13, 1996 sponsored by the Open Society Institute
and organized by the Center for Democracy and Technology. The meeting was
held in order to:

<UL>
<LI>discuss online freedom of expression issues;
<LI>identify work being done in this area around the world;
<LI>establish a network of NGOs committed to free expression and the free
flow of information and the Internet; and,
<LI>plan means of sharing information regarding developments in online free
expression; and,
<LI>explore ways to participate in regional and international policy decisionmaking
forums which will affect the Internet.
</UL>

Attendees included NGO representatives from Africa, Asia, Western and Central
Europe, the United States, and Canada, as well as public policy specialists
from online service and Internet software companies.  Special thanks go
to the International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX) whose directors
and staff provided guidance and logistical support for the meeting.<BR>
<BR>
The outcome of the meeting was a strong agreement that more coordinated
work is necessary among existing groups in order to advance and protect
free expression on the Internet.  The assembled organizations also agreed
that efforts should be made to help new advocacy organizations develop outside
the United States whose sole mission is to address Internet free expression
issues.  The remainder of the summary outlines the issues discussed and
lists action items agreed to by the participants.<A NAME="pubpolicy"></A><BR>

<H3>II.	Public Policy Issues Identified</H3>
Meeting participants raised a great diversity of Internet freedom issues
from every continent around the world.  Yet, in discussing Internet free
expression issues, a number of common policy issues emerged.  This is a
road map of the common policy themes that were discussed:<BR>
<BR>

<STRONG>A. Internet Service Provider Liability: ISP as bottleneck and government
leverage point restricting the free flow of information</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) -- those entities which provide users
access to the Internet in each locality -- whether non-profit organizations,
government agencies, state telecom monopolies, or competitive businesses,
are the sole access point to the Internet for users large and small.  ISPs
may also maintain World Wide Web sites and Internet news servers for their
users, thereby increasing their importance in the functioning of the Internet.
 As such, ISPs have become key targets of government censorship efforts
directed at the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
Example:	The government of Zambia recently banned an edition of the Weekly
Post, an opposition newspaper published in the country.  The Weekly Post
has, for some time, published its work both on paper and on their World
Wide Web Site, on a server maintained by their Internet Service Provider.
 The ban made it a crime to be in possession of the any copies of the banned
material.  The government used this as a means to force the ISP to remove
the offending material from its Web server.  <BR>
<BR>
Issue: The critical place of ISPs in the Internet framework make them particularly
vulnerable to government intimidation and legally-sanctioned censorship.
 ISPs, however, are generally mere conduits of information or hosts for
web sites, simply offering the technical means for users to receive and
disseminate information.  In most cases, ISPs have no knowledge of the content
of the messages that they transmit, or even the World Wide Web sites which
they host.  ISPs are critical gateways for access to the Internet, as well
as for the flow of information from individuals in any one area to the rest
of the world.  If ISPs become fearful of government penalties arising from
information which is transmitted or hosted by the ISP, however, the ISP
may well be induced to restrict the free flow of information through its
facilities.  Though it is impossible to screen all of the numerous messages
and massive amounts of information on a typical web site, even the attempt
to do so would severely restrict the free flow of information on the Internet.
 <BR>
<BR>
Post script:  As it happens, before the banned articles were removed from
the Zambian Web site, an Internet user in the United States downloaded the
material.  The banned articles are still available on web servers in other
African countries and the United States.<BR>
<BR>

<STRONG>B. Internet Service Market Structure: State-run, private monopoly,
or competitive markets</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
As Internet services begin to develop around the world, a variety of market
structures are emerging.  In many cases, restrictive telecommunications
regulations, combined with the pattern that Internet services often originate
in university settings, lead to the result that Internet access is effectively
limited to certain classes of users in only small regions of the country.<BR>
<BR>
Examples: A number of countries place strict controls on the Internet market,
limiting access to the Net in general.  Here are a few examples discussed:
<UL>
<LI>Singapore: ISPs must be licensed as broadcasters, with numerous regulatory
requirements.
<LI>Equador: The State bank has the exclusive right to provide Internet
services in the country and the only international connection to the Internet.
 The conditions make it difficult for alternative access providers to develop
and provide services.
<LI>Botswana: ISP are banned altogether.
<LI>Zimbabwe:  ISPs exist but appear to be illegal under the national telecommunications
law.
</UL>
Issue: The regulatory structure of the Internet service market has a substantial
impact on the number of users in a country who have access to the Internet,
as well as the general free flow of information in that country.  If there
is only a single ISP, or merely a small number of them, the likelihood that
such services will be intimated by governments increases.  Moreover, if
Internet service are provided by state-run or state-controlled institutions
such as universities or telecommunications para-statals, the opportunity
for government control of content is also increased.<BR>
<BR>

<STRONG>C. Regulatory models for the Internet: Is it broadcasting, print,
or something new?</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
As the Internet increases in popularity around the world, national governments
and regional entities such as the European Union are wrestling with the
question of how to fit the Internet into the current regulatory structure
which governs traditional communications media, or whether to create new
regulatory models.  The outcome of these decisions are critical for the
free expression rights of all users online.  Yet, most policy makers are
deciding these issues in forum without any input whatsoever from the user
community.<BR>
<BR>
Examples:  Recent developments include:

<UL>
<LI>Singapore: The government has already decided to regulate Internet Service
Providers as traditional broadcasting entities, thus imposing numerous regulatory
burdens and content controls on ISPs.
<LI>United States:  With the passage of the Communications Decency Act,
the US Congress has imposed a variety of radio and television broadcast
indecency restrictions on Internet users, content providers, and service
providers.
<LI>Australia:  The Australia Broadcasting Authority is currently considering
what regulatory model to apply to ISPs.
<LI>European Union:  Actions now pending before various EU bodies (with
a first reading already having occurred in the Parliament) would impose
a variety of broadcast-like regulatory requirements on ISPs throughout Europe.
</UL>

Issue:  Imposition of broadcast-like regulations on the Internet would be
a fundamental impediment to the free flow of information online.  Regulations
which may have been appropriate and easily applied in the broadcast context,
simply make no sense when applied to the Internet.  Moreover, extension
of broadcast regulations give governments a great degree of censorship authority
over Internet content.<BR>
<BR>
Note:  Actions take by governments around the world will have an impact
on the free flow of information globally.  Of particular concern, however,
are actions that may be taken by the European Union over the next year.
 A number of Central European states are seeking EU membership.  So, decisions
taken by the EU regarding the Internet now will be binding on the new members
in the future.<BR>
<BR>

<STRONG>D. Citizen Access to Government Information</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
The Internet can be a powerful enhancement of citizen's access to government
information such as the text of law, legislative proposal under consideration,
as well as judicial and regulatory decisions.  Especially in newly emerging
democracies, it is important to identify successful models for use of the
Internet to increase citizens participation in governing processes.<BR>
<BR>

<STRONG>E. Communications Privacy: Electronic Surveillance Online and the
status of Internet Wiretaps in International Law</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Free expression only exists where citizens feel that the privacy of their
communications and associations are sufficiently protected from government
intrusion.  Many uncertainties exist regarding the legal limitations on
electronic surveillance on the Internet.  Meanwhile, numerous national restrictions
on the use of encryption leave the Internet environment without basic security
protections.

<UL>
<LI>Lack of International Human Rights Standards:  At present, there is
no international law or international human rights standards that clearly
address the issue of electronic surveillance on the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>European Union encryption policy:  The EC DG XIII is about to issue
a policy proposal regarding the use of encryption technology for privacy
protection and government access to electronic communications.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>United States encryption policy:  After the highly controversial Clipper
Chip proposal, the US is moving forward with policy alternatives aimed at
controlling the use of cryptography in order to assure law enforcement access
to private communications.
</UL><BR>

SUBJECT: FCC MODIFIES CALLER ID POLICY

On Thursday, May 4, 1995, the Federal Communications Commission voted to 
approve national Caller ID rules requiring carriers to provide "a free, 
simple and consistent, per call blocking and unblocking mechanism."  In 
addition, under the new rules carriers are permitted to extend per-line 
blocking options selected by consumers for intrastate calls, to the 
consumers interstate calls.  This action reverses an earlier rule adopted 
in March 1994, that required separate systems for intrastate and interstate 
calls.  The Commissions earlier rules allowed for per-call blocking only.  
The new rules take effect December 1, 1995.

The Center for Democracy and Technology supports the new FCC policy on Caller 
ID.  Caller ID or Automatic Number Identification (ANI) is a device that 
displays to a recipient of a call the telephone number of an incoming call 
while the phone is ringing.  

The introduction of Caller ID technology sparked an emotional and divisive 
debate.  The unlimited use of Caller ID threatened to place the privacy rights 
of the individual in his or her capacity as maker and receiver of telephone 
calls in tension.  Civil liberties organizations were quick to point out that 
technology was available to honor the privacy right of the consumer in their
capacity as both the sender and recipient of phone calls.  Civil liberties 
organizations stated that through blocking users of telephones could be given 
control over information.  For the caller, blocking allows them to choose when 
and to whom to release their phone number.  For the recipient, blocking provides 
receivers with information that an incoming caller does not want their phone 
number revealed.  Additional features can allow recipients of phone calls to 
choose whether or not to refuse all incoming calls that employ blocking, send 
blocked calls to voice mail or answering machine, or exercise their option to 
answer or not answer the unidentified call on a per call basis.  

The latest FCC policy responds to the dual civil liberty concerns of respecting 
and protecting the individual caller's privacy expectations, and respecting the
important privacy interest of the receiver to limit intrusions by unknown, or 
unwanted callers.  

THE NEW FCC POLICY:

1. Where a customer selects per-line blocking for in-state calls the new policy 
   permits that choice to extend to interstate calls as well;

2. Permits customers to prohibit the transmission of Caller ID information - 
   number, name, location - at all times, but on a per-call basis choose to 
   release the information by using the code *82.

3. Binds states without Caller ID and blocking regulations to federal privacy 
   protection models, which require per-calling blocking through the use of 
   code *67.

CDT commends the FCC for issuing a policy that encourages technological 
development that maximizes individual choice and affirms individuals' expectations 
of privacy.

SUBJECT: Justice Department Says CDA Threatens First Amendment and 
         Privacy Rights, Recommends Comprehensive Review.

The US Department of Justice, in a May 3, 1995 letter sent to Senator 
Patrick Leahy (D-VT), has weighed in on the debate over the 
Communications Decency Act, stating that it threatens first amendment 
and privacy rights and would severely complicate ongoing efforts to 
prosecute child pornogrophy cases. The Department instead recommended
a comprehensive review of current law and law enforcement resources, 
as well as an investigation into the availablity of technical means to 
empower parents and users to control the commercial and noncommercial 
content they receive through interactive media. The full text of the 
DOJ letter is available thru CDT's online archives (URL's below).

The Justice Department wrote:

"With respect to the communications Decency Act, while we understand
that section 402 is intended to provide users of online services the
same protection against obscene and harassing communications afforded 
to telephone subscribers, this provision would not accomplish that 
goal.  Instead, it would significantly thwart enforcement of existing 
laws regarding obscenity and child pornography, create several ways for
distributors and packages of obscenity and child pornography to avoid 
criminal liability, and threaten important First Amendment and privacy 
rights."

<...>

"Despite the flaws in these provisions, the Administration applauds the 
primary goal of this legislation:  prevent obscenity from being widely 
transmitted over telecommunications networks to which minors have access.  
However, the legislation raises complex policy issues that merit close 
examination prior to Congressional action.  We recommend that a 
comprehensive review be undertaken of current laws and law enforcement 
resources for prosecuting online obscenity and child pornography, and
the technical means available to enable parents and users to control
the commercial and non commercial communications they receive over 
interactive telecommunications systems."

In addition, the Department raised specific concerns regarding the
constitutionality of the legislation:

"First, Section 402 of the bill would impose criminal sanctions on the
transmission of constitutionally protected speech.  Specifically, 
subsections 402(a)(1) and (b)(2) of the bill would criminalize the 
transmission of indecent communications, which are protected by the
First Amendment.  In _Sable Communications of Cal. v. FCC_, 492 U.S. 
115 (1989), the Supreme Court ruled that any restrictions on the content
of protected  speech in media other than broadcast media must advance a 
compelling state interest and be accomplished by the "least restrictive
means."  By relying on technology relevant only to 900 number services, 
section 402 fails to take into account less  restrictive alternatives 
utilizing existing and emerging technologies which enable parents and 
other adult users to control access to content."

"Nearly ten years of litigation, along with modifications of the 
regulations, were necessary before the current statute as applied to 
audiotext services, or "dial-a-porn" calling numbers, was upheld as
constitutional.  See _Dial Information Services v. Thornburg_, 938 F. 
2d 1535 (2d Cir. 1991).  The proposed amendment in section 40-2 of 
the bill would jeopardize the enforcement of the existing dial-a-porn 
statute by inviting additional constitutional challenges, with the 
concomitant diversion of law enforcement resources."

The Justice Department Letter represents an important development in 
the fight to block the Communications Decency Act and the effort to 
develop less restrictive technical alternatives. The Center For 
Democracy and Technology commends the Justice Department for 
recognizing the threat the Communications Decency Act poses to First
Amendment rights and for its leadership in this area. CDT is looking 
forward to working with the Department to develop alternative prolicy 
solutions which protect the First Amendment, privacy rights, and the 
free flow of information in cyberspace.

(2) SUBJECT: American Family Association Expresses Concern about CDA,
             Says Defenses Must Be Axed, Current Law Sufficient.

The American Family Association, a conservative pro-family organization, 
has sent a letter to Senators Exon (D-NE) and Pressler (R-SD) stating 
that the Communications Decency Act as currently drafted would grant 
those who distribute pornography on the Internet greater protection 
than exists for current law. The American Family Assocaition reccomended 
that the defenses to prosecution be removed from the legislation.

The letter states that, in its current form, "...the pro-family movement 
will uniformly oppose your (Sen. Exon) bill and, if necessarry, the
telecommunications bill to which it is attached, unless significant 
changes are made prior to a vote on the Senate floor."

The American Family Association stated that current law is sufficient 
to address the concerns Senator Exon is attempting to address: 

"... it is unnecessary to change that law as your bill would do, 
unless you are seeking to clarify this point and add improvements 
to the law.  Also, it is my opinion, although this point may not be 
as clear or settled as the first, that federal criminal law, s
pecifically Title 18 Sections 1462 and 1465 prohibits distribution of 
obscenity via computer whether or not for commercial purpose. 
Further, it is my opinion that a primary problem regarding computer
pornography is the lack of leadership and enforcement on this issue 
by the Clinton Administration.  While current laws could be improved, 
the Administration could make substantial progress in protecting 
children in particular from both obscenity and child pornography by 
using existing law to prosecute illegal pornographers who use the 
Internet if it had the will to do so."

The American Family Association is the second pro-family group to 
publicly express concerns over the Communications Decency Act 
(in March Morality In Media raised similar concerns).

the Morality In Media statement, can be found at the following URL's:

SUBJECT: Clinton Administration Announces Outline of Counter
         Terrorism Initiative.

The Clinton Administration today unveiled an outline of administration
proposals to combat foreign and domestic terrorism in the wake of the 
Oklahoma City bombing. The outline is attached below.

These proposals on their face raise obvious civil liberties concerns, 
including government interference with privacy, free speech, free 
association and Forth Amendment rights. CDT is waiting for the
Administration to elaborate and provide concrete legislative proposals
so that we can assess the full civil liberties ramifications.

This document is merely an outline, not specific legislation
or executive order. The administration is expected to produce a more formal 
proposal in the coming weeks. These proposals are likely to supplement
the Omnibus Counter-Terrorism Act of 1995 (S. 390, HR 896), which is
currently pending before Congress.

CDT believes that there must be substantial open, public discussion of 
these proposals and thier potential implications before any action is 
taken.

We have set up the following URL's to provide information on the 
counter-terrorism issue. Updates will be made as soon as more information
becomes available.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Clinton Administration Counter Terrorism Initiative

I.      Actions Already Announced by the President

        (1) Pass the Omnibus Counter-Terrorism Act of 1995

        This bill would provide clear Federal criminal jurisdiction for 
any international terrorist attack that might occur in the United States; 
provide Federal criminal jurisdiction over terrorists who use the United 
States as the place from which to plan terrorist attacks overseas; provide
a workable mechanism, utilizing United States District Judges appointed by 
the Chief Justice, to deport expeditiously alien terrorists without risking 
the disclosure of national security information or techniques; provide a new 
mechanism for preventing fundraising in the United States that supports 
international terrorist activities overseas; and would implement an 
international treaty requiring the insertion of a chemical agent into 
plastic explosives when manufactured to make them detectable.

        (2) Provide more tools to federal law enforcement agencies 
          fighting terrorism

* AMEND THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT TO EASE ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AND
  CREDIT REPORTS IN ANTI-TERRORISM CASES. This legislation provides for
  disclosures by consumer reporting agencies to the FBI for
  counterintelligence and counterterrorism purposes. The FBI has no
  mechanism for obtaining credit reports for lead purposes in
  counterterrorism cases. These reports are available to used car
  dealers and other merchants. The FBI currently has authority under the
  Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 to obtain similar records
  pursuant to a "National Security Letter" signed by a high-ranking FBI
  official. the same procedures and safeguards would apply to credit
  records under this proposal.

* AMEND FEDERAL LAW TO ADOPT, IN NATIONAL SECURITY CASES THE STANDARD
  CURRENTLY USED IN OBTAINING A "PEN REGISTER" IN A ROUTINE CRIMINAL
  CASE. This proposal would extend the relaxed standard for obtaining
  "pen registers" and "trap and trace" device orders which already
  exists in routine criminal cases, to national security cases. A "pen
  register" is a device which records the number dialed on a telephone.
  A "trap and trace" devices is similar to "Caller ID," providing law
  enforcement with the telephone number from which a call originates.
  Neither "pen registers" nor "trap and trace" devices permit law
  enforcement to monitor actual conversations being conducted. the
  current, higher-than-regular standard impedes the ability of the FBI
  to obtain surveillance coverage of terrorists and spies.

* PASS LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE HOTEL/MOTEL AND COMMON CARRIERS TO PROVIDE
  RECORDS NECESSARY FOR FIGHTING TERRORISM. This proposal would require
  hotel/motel and common carriers such as airlines and bus companies to
  provide records to the FBI pursuant to authorized national security
  requests just as they must do now for virtually all state and local 
  law enforcement. The FBI must now rely on the voluntary assistance of
  motel, hotel, and other innkeepers or common carriers regarding
  records of terrorists who may have stayed at the establishment or used
  the common carrier. The FBI has found that, while some of these
  entities voluntarily provide such information, an increasing number
  refuse, absent a court order, a subpoena, or other legal protection.
  In a counterterrorism case being conducted pursuant to the Attorney
  General's guidelines for FBI Foreign Intelligence Collection and
  Foreign Counterintelligence Investigations, there is no legal
  mechanism, e.g. subpoena, available to obtain these records.

* FULLY FUND THE FBI'S "DIGITAL TELEPHONY" INITIATIVE TO ASSURE COURT
  AUTHORIZED LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCESS FOR ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE TO
  DIGITIZED COMMUNICATIONS. This proposal would appropriate funds to
  implement recent amendments to statutes governing secure telephone
  transmission (digital telephony). These amendments require telephone 
  carriers to install and maintain sophisticated equipment which would
  permit law enforcement to continue to conduct legal electronic
  surveillance.

* CREATE AND ALLOCATE FUNDS FOR A SPECIAL FBI COUNTERTERRORIST AND
  COUNTERINTELLIGENCE FUND. This proposal will fund costs associated
  cases which arise in connection with terrorism crises, including
  logistics and other support.

* Create an interagency Domestic Counterterrorism Center headed by the
  FBI. This proposal will establish a partnership effort between the
  Justice Department, including the FBI, and other federal and state law
  enforcement authorities to coordinate efforts within the United
  States.

      (3) CONDUCT TERRORISM THREAT ASSESSMENT OF EVERY FEDERAL FACILITY
IN THE COUNTRY WITHIN THE NEXT 60 DAYS. The President has
directed the Attorney General to conduct this assessment and report her 
recommendations in 60 days. The assessment has already begun.

        (4) DIRECT GSA TO REPLACE THE FEDERAL BUILDING IN OKLAHOMA CITY.

        (5) DIRECT THE FBI DIRECTOR, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER TO PREPARE A PRESIDENTIAL DECISION DIRECTIVE 
AUTHORIZING ANY AND ALL FURTHER STEPS NECESSARY TO COMBAT FOREIGN AND 
DOMESTIC TERRORISM.

II.     New Legislative Proposals

        (1) INVESTIGATIONS

* HIRE APPROXIMATELY 1000 NEW AGENTS, PROSECUTORS, AND OTHER FEDERAL LAW
  ENFORCEMENT AND SUPPORT PERSONNEL TO INVESTIGATE, DETER, AND PROSECUTE
  TERRORIST ACTIVITY.

* PASS LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE, WITHIN 1 YEAR, THE INCLUSION OF TAGGANTS 
  IN STANDARD EXPLOSIVE DEVICE RAW MATERIALS WHICH WILL PERMIT TRACING
  OF THE MATERIALS POST-EXPLOSION. This proposal would require the
  inclusion of microscopic particles in certain raw materials, thereby
  permitting law enforcement to trace the source of the explosive even
  after a device has been detonated.

* REQUIRE THE BATF TO STUDY AND REPORT ON 1) THE TAGGING OF EXPLOSIVE
  MATERIALS FOR PURPOSES OF IDENTIFICATION AND DETECTION; 2) WHETHER
  COMMON CHEMICALS USED TO MANUFACTURE EXPLOSIVES CAN BE RENDERED INERT
  FOR USE IN EXPLOSIVES; AND 3) WHETHER CONTROLS CAN BE IMPOSED ON
  CERTAIN PRECURSOR CHEMICALS USED TO MANUFACTURE EXPLOSIVES. In light
  of recent bombing incidents, there is a need to develop technologies
  that will make it possible to detect concealed explosives.
  Additionally, if bombings do take place, a means of providing some
  clues is needed to lead investigators to those responsible for the
  explosion. Moreover, since explosives can be manufactured using common
  agricultural and household materials, it is important to determine 
  whether such materials can be manufactured in a manner so that their
  use in explosives is unlikely. Finally, the study would determine
  whether any reasonable controls can be placed on precursor chemicals,
  e.g., ammonium nitrate, which have many legitimate uses.

* AMEND THE POSSE COMITATUS ACT TO PERMIT MILITARY PARTICIPATION IN
  CRIME-FIGHTING INVOLVING WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. This proposal
  would amend Federal Laws, which severely limit the role of the
  military in domestic law enforcement, to permit military participation
  in criminal cases involving chemical, biological, and other weapons of 
  mass destruction; areas in which the military has specialized
  expertise.

* AMEND THE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT OF 1868 TO  
  CONSTITUTIONALLY ENHANCE USE OF ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE TO FIGHT
  TERRORISM. This proposal would: permit any federal felony to be used
  as a basis for an electronic surveillance order; ease restrictions on
  the use, in American court proceedings, of information from electronic
  surveillance conducted by foreign governments; forbid suppression of
  electronic evidence unless law enforcement acted in bad faith in
  obtaining the evidence; authorize emergency electronic surveillance in
  situations involving threats by domestic terrorist organizations,
  authorize roving wiretaps where it is not practical to specify the
  number of the phone to be tapped, such as where a target uses multiple  
  pay phones; allow the FBI to obtain records of local telephone calls,
  without the need for a court order, as they can own obtain records of   
  long-diastase calls; and require telephone companies and/or service
  providers to preserve evidence until a court order could be obtained.
  None of these changes would alter the requirement for probable cause
  prior to engaging in electronic surveillance.

        (2) PROSECUTION

* AMEND FEDERAL LAW TO CRIMINALIZE THE USE OF ALL CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO 
  INCLUDE ALL FORMS OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS. This bill would amend federal
  law to include chemical weapons in non-gaseous form. Under existing
  law, chemical weapons in gaseous form are covered, but those which are
  in liquid or solid form are not. Thus, for example, an individual who
  introduces dioxin in solid form into the water supply of a city would
  not be chargeable under current law.

* MAKE IT ILLEGAL TO POSSESS EXPLOSIVES KNOWING THAT THEY ARE STOLEN.
  This proposal would conform explosive laws to existing firearms
  statutes, making it a crime for an individual to possess explosives
  which the individual knows are stolen.

* EXTEND THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON THE NATIONAL FIREARMS ACT TO FIVE
  (5) YEARS. This proposal would extend from three (3) to five (5) years 
  the statute of limitations for prosecution for violations of the
  National Firearms Act, which deals with explosive and incendiary
  bombs. This change brings the statue of limitations for these offenses
  in line with similar criminal provisions.

* PROVIDE THE SECRETARY OF TREASURY AUTHORITY TO DIRECT THE USE OF  
  TREASURY DEPARTMENT AIRCRAFT TO SUPPORT EMERGENCY LAW ENFORCEMENT
  SITUATIONS. This proposal would authorize the Secretary of Treasury to
  authorize the use of Treasury Department aircraft in support of
  emergency law enforcement crises.

* AMEND REWARD STATUTES TO REDUCE RESTRICTIONS ON MAKING REWARDS. This
  proposal would provide the Attorney General authority to pay a reward
  which is not subject to the spending limitations contained in 18 USC
   3059 and 3072, provided that any reward of $100,000 or more may not
  be made without the approval of the President of the Attorney General,
  and such approval may not be delegated.

        (3) PENALTIES

* INCREASE THE PENALTY FOR ANYONE CONVICTED OF TRANSFERRING A FIREARM OR
  EXPLOSIVE KNOWING THAT IT WILL BE SUE DOT COMMIT A CRIME OF VIOLENCE
  OR DRUG TRAFFICKING CRIME. This proposal will provide a mandatory
  penalty of not less than 10 years for any person who transfers a
  firearm knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that a firearm
  will be used to commit a crime of violence or drug-trafficking crime.

* AMEND 18 USC  111 TO PROVIDE ENHANCED PENALTIES FOR ALL CURRENT AND
  FORMER FEDERAL EMPLOYEES AGAINST TERRORIST ATTACKS. The existing
  statute only protects enumerated categories of current Federal
  employees. The proposed statute would provide enhanced penalties for
  crimes against all current and former Federal employees, and their
  immediate families, when the crime is committed because of the
  official duties of the federal employee.

UPDATE: Communications Decency Act Senate Vote Expected by June

The Senate is expected to consider telecommunications reform legislation
(S. 652), which includes the Exon/Gorton Communications Decency Act 
(Title IV), sometime towards the end of May or begining of June. The 
vote had been expected to occur in the first week of May, but other issues, 
including counter-terrorism legislation, are likely to delay Senate action.

Senator Patrick Leahy's (D-VT) alternative proposal (S. 714) is gaining 
support among key members of congress and industry. CDT is working with 
Senator Leahy, the public interest community, and representatives of the 
communicaitons, computer, online services, and publishing industries to 
generate support for Senator Leahy's proposal.

Action on the House version of the CDA (HR 1004) is not expected to occur 
any time soon as its sponsor, Rep. Tim Johnson (D-SD) has recently backed 
away from the proposal. In a letter to Rep. Jack Fields (R-TX and Chair of 
the Hse. Telecomm. Subcommitte), circulated by CDT, Rep. Johnson urged the 
Committee to hold hearings and consider alternatives to protect children 
from controversial content instead of rushing to enact the CDA.

CDT has set up the following auto-reply aliases to keep you informed on the 
Communications Decency Act issue.

SUBJECT:        House CDA Sponsor Calls for Hearings, Go-Slow Approach

Representative Tim Johnson (D-SD) recently sent the attached letter to Rep.
Jack Fields (R-TX), chairman of the House Subcommittee on
Telecommunications and Finance, urging the subcommittee to carefully
examine the issues raised by the legislation before rushing to enact it. 

In the letter, Johnson clarifies that he sponsored HR 1004 only to
facilitate a discussion and hearings on the issue.  Johnson writes that
while "it is essential for your committee to consider obscenity,
harassment, and First Amendment concerns as well as over-all enforceability
matters ... it is my hope that you will hold hearings which permit all
points of view to be heard before taking any action on this issue."

The House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance is currently
drafting legislation to overhaul the Nation's telecommunications laws.  A
modified version of the Exon/Gorton "Communications Decency Act" (S. 314)
was incorporated into similar legislation approved last month by the Senate
Commerce Committee.

HR 1004 is the House counterpart to the Exon/Gorton Communications Decency
Act, which would criminalize the transmission of any content deemed
"obscene, indecent, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or harassing."   Unlike the
Senate version, HR 1004 has not been modified since its introduction. 

CDT wishes to thank People for the American Way for obtaining a copy of
this letter and forwarding it to us for distribution.

April 3, 1995

The Honorable Jack Fields
Chairman 
Subcommittee on Telecommunications 
 and Finance
House Committee on Commerce
2125 Rayburn House Office Building
Washington, DC 20515

Dear Jack:

I am writing to you today relative to legislation which I have sponsored,
HR 1004, a house counterpart to Senator Exon's S. 314, the Communications
Decency Act.  S. 314 was recently incorporated by voice vote into the
Senate Commerce Committee's telecommunications reform legislation.  The
amendment attempts to update the Communications Act of 1934 by providing
users of digital communications the same protections telephone users
currently have against obscene, indecent, or harassing telephone calls.

I want to advise you that I have sponsored HR 1004 simply as a beginning
point for hearings and discussion and not necessarily to propose that this
bill, or any bill for that matter, is necessarily the proper response to
concerns over obscenity. While it appears that the Exon provision as
amended goes a long way to address the liability questions by exempting
companies or entities which merely provide transmission services for the
Internet, I remain concerned that this issue needs a thorough examination
through the hearing process.

It is essential for your committee to consider obscenity, harassment, and
First Amendment concerns as well as over-all enforceability matters.  For
that reason, it is my hope that you will hold hearings which will permit
all points of view to be heard before taking any action on this issue.
Hopefully, you and your committee will have an opportunity to consider this
important issue in a carefully deliberative fashion which will balance
concerns for children and others from unwanted obscene material on the
Internet with free and enhanced use of the Internet. It may very well be
that this balance is best achieved by voluntary means rather than by new
legislation, but I will be appreciative of your willingness to carefully
investigate this complex issue.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely, 
{sig}
Tim Johnson

SUBJECT: Senator Leahy Introduces Alternative to Exon/Gorton 
         Communications Decency Act 

Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) today introduced the "Child Protection, User
Empowerment, and Free Expression in Interactive Media Study Bill" (S. 714).
The bill represents an alternative to Senator Exon (D-NE) and Senator
Gorton's (R-WA) "Communications Decency Act", which would criminalize the
transmission of any content deemed "obscene, indecent, lewd, lascivious,
filthy, or harassing."  

Leahy's bill would direct the Department of Justice, in consultation with
the Commerce Department, to conduct a study to address technical means for
empowering users to control information they receive over interactive
communications systems such as the Internet, commercial online services,
independent BBS's, and future interactive media.  The bill is being
co-sponsored by Senators Bob Kerry (D-NE) and Herb Kohl (D-WI), and is
expected to generate support across party lines.

The Communications Decency Act, which Leahy seeks to replace, is now
pending before the Senate as part of the "Telecommunications Competition
and Deregulation Act of 1995' (S. 652).

In a statement announcing the introduction of the bill, Senator Leahy urged
Congress to carefully consider the implications of imposing content
restrictions on interactive media. "Heavy-handed efforts by government to
regulate obscenity on interactive information services will only stifle the
free flow of information, discourage the robust development of new
information services, and make users avoid using the system" Leahy said.

Instead, Leahy urged a careful consideration of possible alternatives
before Congress attempts to legislate in this area.  Under the legislation
introduced today, the Department of Justice, in consultation with the
Department of Commerce, would examine:

* Whether current laws prohibiting the distribution of obscenity and child
  pornography by means of computers are sufficient.

* Whether current law enforcement resources are sufficient to enforce
  existing laws.

* The availability of technical means to enable parents and other users to
  control access to "commercial, non-commercial, violent, sexually explicit,
  harassing, offensive, or otherwise unwanted" content. 

* Recommendations to encourage the development and deployment of such
  technologies

* The availability of technical means to promote the free flow of
  information consistent with Constitutional values.

The Center for Democracy and Technology commends Senator Leahy for his
leadership on this issue and his efforts to promote the free flow of
information in cyberspace.  CDT will work to support Senator Leahy's
efforts and to develop alternatives to content restrictions in interactive
media.

LEAHY STATEMENT ON INTRODUCTION OF S. 714

STATEMENT OF SENATOR LEAHY
On Introduction of The Child Protection, User Empowerment, and Free
Expression In Interactive Media Study Bill

April 7, 1995

Mr. President: I rise today to introduce a bill calling for a study by the
Department of Justice, in consultation with the U.S. Department of Commerce
on how we can empower parents and users of interactive telecommunications
systems, such as the Internet, to control the material transmitted to them
over those systems. We must find ways to do this that do not invite
invasions of privacy, lead to censorship of private online communications,
and undercut important constitutional protections.

Before legislating to impose government regulation on the content of
communications in this enormously complex area, I feel we need more
information from law enforcement and telecommunications experts. My bill
calls for just such a fast-track study of this issue.

There is no question that we are now living through a revolution in
telecommunications with cheaper, easier to use and faster ways to
communicate electronically with people within our own homes and
communities, and around the globe.

A byproduct of this technical revolution is that supervising our children
takes on a new dimension of responsibility. Very young children are so
adept with computers that they can sit at a keypad in front of a computer
screen at home or at school and connect to the outside world through the
Internet or some other on-line service. Many of us are, thus, justifiably
concerned about the accessibility of obscene and indecent materials on-line
and the ability of parents to monitor and control the materials to which
their children are exposed. But government regulation of the content of all
computer and telephone communications, even private communications, in
violation of the First Amendment is not the answer -- it is merely a
knee-jerk response.

Heavy-handed efforts by government to regulate obscenity on interactive
information services will only stifle the free flow of information,
discourage the robust development of new information services, and make
users avoid using the system.

The problem of policing the Internet is complex and involves many important
issues. We need to protect copyrighted materials from illegal copying. We
need to protect privacy. And we need to help parents protect their
children. Penalties imposed after the harm is done is not enough. We need
to find technical means from stopping the harm done before it happens.

My bill calls for a study to address the legal and technical issues for
empowering users to control the information they receive over electronic
interactive services. Instead of rushing to regulate the content of
information services, we should encourage the development of technology
that gives parents and other consumers the ability to control the
information that can be access over a modem.

Empowering parents to manage what their kids access over the Internet with
technology under their control is far preferable to some of the bills
pending in Congress that would criminalize users or deputize information
service providers as smut police.

Let's see what this study reveals before we start legislating in ways that
could severely damage electronic communications systems, sweep away
important constitutional rights, and undercut law enforcement at the same
time.

I ask unanimous consent, to have printed in the record at this pint, the
"Child Protection, User Empowerment, and Free Expression in Interactive
Media Study" bill.

distribution of child pornography by means of computers are fully
enforceable  in interactive media;

(2) an assessment of the Federal, State, and local law enforcement
resources that are currently available to enforce those laws;

(3) an evaluation of the technical means available to --

        (A) enable parents to exercise control over the information that
their children receive and enable other users to exercise control over the
commercial and noncommercial information that they receive over interactive
telecommunications systems so that they may avoid violent, sexually
explicit, harassing, offensive, or otherwise unwanted material; and

        (B) promote the free flow of information consistent, with
Constitutional values, in interactive media; and

(4) recommendations to encourage the development and deployment of
technical means, including hardware and software, to enable parents to
exercise control over the information that their children receive and
enable other users of exercise control over the information that they
receive over interactive telecommunications systems so that they may avoid
harassing, violent, sexually explicit, harassing, offensive, or otherwise
unwanted material.

        (b) CONSULTATION -- In conducting the study and preparing the
report under subsection (a), the Attorney General shall consult with the
National Telecommunications and Information Administration of the
Department of Commerce.

The Center for Democracy and Technology is pleased to distribute this
statement delivered by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) on the floor of the
Senate today.  Leahy makes clear his opposition to the bill, explains that
the Exon approach is the wrong way to regulate interactive media, and
declares that the bill would threaten the free speech and privacy rights of
all users of interactive services.  

At the close of his statement, Senator Leahy calls on the Interactive
Working Group (an ad hoc group of civil liberties and
computer/telecommunications industry groups coordinated by CDT) to explore
alternatives to the Exon bill.  We are delighted to have such a strong
civil liberties advocate on our side in the struggle over protecting and
defining free speech in interactive media.


STATEMENT OF SENATOR LEAHY ON CENSORING CYBERSPACE

MARCH 30, 1995

Mr. President:  I rise today to speak about legislation that would *impose*
government regulation on the content of communications transmitted over
computer networks.  Ironically, this legislation was accepted without
debate by the Commerce Committee as an amendment to a draft
telecommunications bill whose purported purpose is to *remove* regulation
from significant parts of the telecommunications industry.  It is rumored
that this matter could be headed for consideration by the Senate on Monday,
although the bill has yet to be introduced and the Commerce Committee has
yet to issue its report on the measure.

There is no question that we are now living through a revolution in
telecommunications with cheaper, easier to use and faster ways to
communicate electronically with people within our own homes and
communities, and around the globe.

A byproduct of this technical revolution is that supervising our
children takes on a new dimension of responsibility.  Very young children
are so adept with computers that they can sit at a keypad in front of a
computer screen at home or at school and connect to the outside world
through the Internet or some other on-line service.  Many of us are, thus,
justifiably concerned about the accessibility of obscene and indecent
materials on-line and the ability of parents to monitor and control the
materials to which their children are exposed.  But government regulation
of the content of all computer communications, even private communications,
in violation of the First Amendment is not the answer-- it is merely a
knee-jerk response.

Although well-intentioned, my good friend from Nebraska, Senator
Exon, is championing an approach that I believe unnecessarily intrudes into
personal privacy, restricts freedoms and upsets legitimate law enforcement
needs.  He successfully offered the Commerce Committee an amendment that
would make it a felony to send certain kinds of communications over
computer networks, even though some of these communications are otherwise
constitutionally protected speech under the First Amendment.  This
amendment would chill free speech and the free flow of information over the
Internet and computer networks, and undo important privacy protections for
computer communications.  At the same time, this amendment would undermine
law enforcement's most important tool for policing cyberspace by
prohibiting the use of court-authorized wiretaps for any "digital
communications".

Under this Exon Amendment, those of us who are users of computer
e-mail and other network systems would have to speak as if we were in
Sunday School every time we went on-line.  I, too, support raising our
level of civility in communications in this country, but not with a
government sanction and possible prison sentence when someone uses an
expletive.  The Exon amendment makes it a felony punishable by two years
imprisonment to send a personal e-mail message to a friend with "obscene,
lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" words in it.  This penalty adds new
meaning to the adage, "Think twice before you speak."  All users of
Internet and other information services would have to clean up their
language when they go on-line, whether or not they are communicating with
children.

It would turn into criminals people, who in the privacy of their
own homes, download racy fiction or "indecent" photographs.  This would
have a significant chilling effect on the free flow of communications over
the Internet and other computer networks.  Furthermore, banning the use of
"lewd, filthy, lascivious or indecent words, which fall under
constitutional protection, raises significant First Amendment problems.

Meanwhile, the amendment is crafted to protect the companies who
provide us with service.  They are given special defenses to avoid criminal
liability.  Such defenses may unintentionally encourage conduct that is
wrong and borders on the illegal.

For example, the amendment would exempt those who exercise no
editorial control over content.  This would have the perverse effect of
stopping responsible electronic bulletin board system (BBS) operators from
screening the boards for hate speech, obscenity and other offensive
material.  Since such screening is just the sort of editorial control that
could land BBS operators in jail for two years if they happened to miss a
bit of obscenity put up on a board, they will avoid it like the plague. 
Thus, this amendment stops responsible screening by BBS operators.

On the other hand, another defense rewards with complete immunity
any service provider who goes snooping for smut through private messages. 
According to the language of the amendment, on-line providers who take
steps "to restrict or prevent the transmission of, or access to" obscene,
lewd, filthy, lascivious, or indecent communications are not only protected
from criminal liability but also from any civil suit for invasion of
privacy by a subscriber.  We will thereby deputize and immunize others to
eavesdrop on private communications.  Overzealous service providers, in the
guise of the smut police, could censor with impunity private e-mail
messages or prevent a user from downloading material deemed "indecent" by
the service provider.

I have worked hard over my years in the Senate to pass bipartisan
legislation to increase the privacy protections for personal communcations
over telephones and on computer networks.  With the Exon amendment, I see
how easily all that work can be undone -- without a hearing or even
consideration by the Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over
criminal laws and constitutional matters such as rights of privacy and free
speech.

Rather than invade the privacy of subscribers, one Vermonter told
me he would simply stop offering any e-mail services or Internet access. 
The Physician's Computer Company in Essex Junction, Vermont, provides
Internet access, e-mail services and medical record tracking services to
pediatricians around the country.  The President of this company let me
know that if this amendment became law, he feared it would "cause us to
lose a significant amount of business."  We should be encouraging these new
high-tech businesses, and not be imposing broad-brush criminal liability in
ways that stifle business in this growth industry.

These efforts to regulate obscenity on interactive information
services will only stifle the free flow of information and discourage the
robust development of new information services.  If users realize that to
avoid criminal liability under this amendment, the information service
provider is routinely accessing and checking their private communications
for obscene, filthy or lewd language or photographs, they will avoid using
the system.

I am also concerned that the Exon Amendment would totally undermine
the legal authority for law enforcement to use court-authorized wiretaps,
one of the most significant tools in law enforcement's arsenal for fighting
crime.  The Exon Amendment would impose blanket prohibition on wiretapping
"digital communications."  No exceptions allowed.

This means that parents of a kidnapping victim could not agree to
have the FBI listen in on calls with the kidnapper, if these calls were
carried in a digital mode.  Or, that the FBI could not get a court order to
wiretap the future John Gotti, if his communications were digital.  Many of
us worked very hard over the last several years and, in particular, during
the last Congress, with law enforcement and privacy advocates to craft a
carefully balanced digital telephony law the increased privacy protections
while allowing legitimate law enforcement wiretaps.  That work will be
undercut by the amendment.  Our efforts to protect kids from on-line
obscenity need not gut one of the most important tools the policy have to
catch crooks, including on-line criminals, their ability to effectuate
court-ordered wiretaps.

The problem of policing the Internet is complex and involves many
important issues.  We need to protect copyrighted materials from illegal
copying.  We need to protect privacy.  And we need to help parents protect
their children.

I have asked a coalition of industry and civil liberties groups,
called the Interactive Working Group, to address the legal and technical
issues for policing electronic interactive services.  Instead of rushing to
regulate the content of information services with the Exon amendment, we
should encourage the development of technology that gives parents and other
consumers the ability to control the information that can be accessed over
a modem.

Empowering parents to control what their kids access over the
Internet and enabling creators to protect their intellectual property from
copyright infringement with technology under their control is far
preferable to criminalizing users or deputizing information service
providers as smut police.

Let's see what this coalition comes up with before we start
imposing liability in ways that could severely damage electronic
communications systems, sweep away important constitutional rights, and
undercut law enforcement at the same time.

We should avoid quick fixes today that would interrupt and limit
the rapid evolution of electronic information systems -- for the public
benefit far exceeds the problems it invariably creates by the force of its
momentum.

CDT ANALYSIS OF REVISED EXON INDECENCY LEGISLATION

I.  OVERVIEW

A revised version of the Communications Decency Act (S.314) was added to the 
Senate telecommunications reform legislation as the reform bill was reported 
out of the Senate Commerce Committee.  In an important improvement over the 
original version, several exemptions have been created to limit criminal 
liability of online services providers where they exercise no control over 
content.  However, despite this significant change the bill is still an 
unconstitutional intrusion of the free speech and privacy rights of Internet 
users and all content providers in interactive media.   (The complete text of 
the bill interleaved into the current statute is attached at the end of this 
Policy Post.)

In simple terms, the Communications Decency Act would enshrine in statute a 
sharp distinction between the print medium and new interactive media.  The 
bill subjects interactive media to the same weak First Amendment protections 
that have evolved for mass media.  Moreover, it places all speech that occurs 
on the Internet and elsewhere in cyberspace under the jurisdiction of the 
Federal Communications Commission.  Both the interactive media and the print 
media are arenas in which individuals and organizations exercise core First 
Amendment free speech rights.  Thus, new interactive media -- which includes 
not only email and Internet servicese, but also interactive TV, video on 
demand and distance learning -- must be protected by the First Amendment.

The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) remains actively opposed to this 
bill.  With the help of Senator Leahy and other civil liberties advocates in 
Congress, we will fight to keep it from being enacted and continue to search 
for alternatives to this dangerous legislation.  CDT believes that federal 
legislation is needed to solidify free speech rights and clarify online 
service provider liability.  Without such legislation, a series of state 
legislative proposed as bad or worse than the Exon/Gorton bill will 
proliferate.  Restrictive proposals already under consideration in states such 
as Maryland, Oregon, and Washington must be pre-empted.  We will work with 
concerned legislators and the Interactive Working Group (an ad hoc coalition 
of public interest organizations, and computer, communication, and publishing 
firms) to develop alternatives.

II.  ANALYSIS OF CURRENT PROPOSAL

The Exon/Gorton bill was introduced to promote the important purpose of 
protecting minors from access to controversial and inappropriate sexually 
explicit material in interactive media including the Internet, other 
commercial online services, electronic bulletin board services (BBS's).  
However, because the proposed statute is grafted onto a twenty five year-old 
provision of the Communications Act which was designed for a centralized 
monopoly telephone environment, instead of diverse, decentralized interactive 
media, it both fails to accomplish its goal and is unconstitutional on its 
face.  In spite of the changes made by Senator Exon, the bill still suffers 
the following critical defects from the standpoint of users and content 
providers:

1.      SECOND CLASS FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS FOR USERS AND CONTENT PROVIDERS ON 
        THE NET AND ALL INTERACTIVE MEDIA:  Even though many laud cyberspace as 
        the new electronic gutenberg printing press accessible to all, the Exon 
        bill treats the Internet, interactive television, and video dialtone 
        systems as if they were one big radio station whose broadcasts are 
        constantly assaulting unwilling listeners.  Those who use these new 
        technologies know that this is not the case.  However, viewing 
        interactive media as an extension of broadcasting diminishes the First 
        Amendment rights of all who use these systems and create content for 
        them.  For example, though an individual is allowed to go into a 
        bookstore and buy a sexually-explicit magazine or a "lewd" work of art, 
        one would not be able to access the identical information over the 
        Internet if this legislation is enacted.  

2.      FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION JURISDICTION OVER ONLINE SPEECH:  The 
        defenses to prosecution established in the new version of the bill gives
        the Federal Communications Commission jurisdiction to establish rules 
        governing distribution of content online.  This will have a dramatic 
        chilling effect on online activity and squelch the development of 
        interactive media.  Regulation of indecency in this new medium is a bad 
        precedent for all kinds of speech in the interactive world.

3.      CRIMINALIZATION OF BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MESSAGES THAT ARE NOT 
        OBSCENE: The Act criminalizes not only obscene, but also "lewd, 
        lascivious, filthy, or indecent" communications, all of which are 
        protected by the First Amendment and cannot be banned.  


4.      IMPERMISSIBLY INTRUSIVE MEANS OF ACHIEVING LEGITIMATE GOAL:  First 
        Amendment jurisprudence requires that restrictions on speech adopt the 
        "least restrictive means" available for achieving a compelling purpose.
        Relying on technological assumptions applicable only to 900 number 
        services and a centrally-controlled telephone system, the Act fails to 
        account for the fact that government restriction on content is 
        unnecessary in interactive media, where parents can control the content 
        that their children access.

5.      FAULTY ANALOGY TO BROADCAST MEDIA: Proponents of the Act have justified
        the constitutionality by improper reliance on content restrictions found
        acceptable in broadcast media. These arguments fail to recognize that 
        while broadcast media may "assult" unwilling listeners, who may be
        in need of government protection, interactive media enables users to
        control the information that they receive.

6.      INVASION OF PRIVACY:  By criminalizing the content of private, non-
        obscene messages, the Act would force an invasion of the realm of 
        private electronic communications and end the individual's ability to 
        control the content of information he or she chooses to access in 
        private.

Alternative means of achieving the goal of protecting minors from access to 
material considered inappropriate by their parents would include:

1.      FEDERAL LEGISLATION ESSENTIAL TO PROTECT FREE SPEECH ON THE NET: 
        CDT believes that there mujst be federal legislation to solidify free
        speech rights and clarify carrier liability which pre-empts state
        legislation in this area.  Otherwise, as series of state legislative
        proposed where are as bad or worse than the Exon/Gorton bill will
        proliferate.  

2.      MAXIMUM RELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY TO EMPOWER PARENTS:  Interactive media 
        offers parents and other users the ability to filter certain kinds of 
        content.  Instead of relying on government censorship, or even 
        government-imposed rating systems, parents should be able to block the 
        delivery of certain information to their children on the basis of their 
        own individual tastes and preferences.

3.      CLEAR PROTECTION FOR CONSTITUTIONALLY-PERMISSIBLE SPEECH:  Any 
        alternative legislation must provide affirmative protection for 
        constitutionally-permissible speech, even if it is lewd, filthy or 
        otherwise controversial.  The First Amendment demands that offensive or 
        disturbing speech must be treated separately than that which is clearly 
        obscene and unprotected.

4.      EMPHASIS ON ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING STATUTES:  Federal and state law 
        already prohibits transportation of obscenity, child pornography, as 
        well as, in many instances threats, stalking and harassment.  To the 
        extent that there are obstacles to enforcing these laws in the new on-
        line environment, Congress should examine whether new law is required, 
        or whether more resources for enforcement (including training for law 
        enforcement in interactive services and cooperative efforts with the 
        industry).

5.      CODIFICATION SEPARATELY FROM EXISTING DIAL-A-PORN STATUTE:
        Modification of the existing  223, originally written for the analogue
        telephone system, to regulate new interactive media causes unnecessary 
        confusion, both for the treatment of the new technology and with 
        respect to the stability of the regulation of audiotext services. If new 
        is written, it should stand on its own. Moreover, Congress should 
        consider which elements properly belong in the Communications Act and 
        which in the Criminal Code.

The regulation of speech, commerce, and privacy rights in new interactive 
communications systems raises many difficult issues of public policy and 
constitutional law.  Before proceeding with legislation, Congress must provide 
the opportunity for public hearings to identify clearly the problems that 
exist, and to identify solutions that are appropriate to the new technology.  
Failure to do so will result in ineffective policy, years of constitutional 
litigation, and a disastrous chilling effect on the development and growth of 
a very promising new communications medium.

EXON INDECENCY BILL APPROVED BY SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE

The Senate Commerce Committee voted unanimously today to adopt S. 314, 
Senator Exon's "Communications Decency Act", as an amendment to the 
Senate telecommunications reform legislation. The amendment was 
introduced by Senator Slade Gorton (R-WA) on behalf of himself an Exon (D-
NE). It received no significant debate and was unanimously approved on a 
voice vote.

The bill was amended from its original form to limit liability for 
telecommunications carriers and online service providers, but users  and 
content providers would still be criminally liable for any communications 
that are deemed "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent".   An analysis 
of these provisions by CDT, as well as the full text of the bill will be posted 
later today.

On initial analysis, CDT still believes that the bill is an unconstitutional 
violation of the free speech and privacy rights of network users and content 
providers. 

Although the Commerce Committee did vote to send the 
Telecommunications reform legislation to the Senate floor, there are still 
serious disputes about the entire package. Because of this, there are still many 
opportunities to remove the "Indecency Provision" as the bill moves to the 
floor.

Stay tuned for further analysis and additional information from CDT.

SENATOR LEAHY ASKS CDT LED COALITION TO EXPLORE ALTERNATIVES TO S. 314 

<p> Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), a strong proponent of civil liberties
and the development of new communications technologies,has raised serious
concerns about the Communications Decency Act (S. 314). In a letter to CDT
Executive Director Jerry Berman and th e Interactive Working Group,
Senator Leahy stated that "The proposed legislative solutions . . . raise
serious concerns about the free flow of information in new communications
media, threaten to squelch the development of the Internet and a vital new
ind ustry along with it." 

<p> Senator Leahy has asked the Interactive Working Group (a coalition of
public interest organizations, members of the computer and communications
industry, and associations representing librarians and the press, chaired
by the Center For Democracy and Techn ology) to "explore alternatives that
balance constitutional liberties, competitiveness, and the legitimate
interest of protecting children from accessing controversial content." The
letter is attached below. 

<p> Leahy's efforts to explore alternatives to S. 314 come at an important
time in this debate over S. 314. The Senate Commerce Committee may still
incorporate S. 314 into telecommunications reform legislation, expected to
be introduced as early next Monday ( 3/20). 

<p> It is critical that you contact Commerce Committee Chairman Pressler
(R- SD), Senator Packwood (R-OR), Senator Hollings (D-SC), and your own
Senators and urge them to: <ul><p>

<li>	Take S. 314 off the fast track,
<p>
<li>	Keep S. 314 out of the Senate telecommunications reform legislation, and,
<p>
<li>	Support Senator Leahy's effort to explore alternatives that are
		consistent with the First Amendment and the free flow of information.<p></ul> 

<p> For more information on how to contact members of
congress, send email to the Voter's Telecommunications Watch <a href =
"mailto:vtw@vtw.org">vtw@vtw.org</a>.<p>

<p> While you are at it, you might send a note of thanks to Senator Leahy
for his efforts on behalf of free speech and the free flow of information
in cyberspace. He can be reached by email at <a href =
"mailto:senator_leahy@leahy.senate.gov">senator_leahy@leahy.senate.gov</a>

<p> The Center for Democracy and members of the Interactive Working Group
are grateful to Senator Leahy for his leadership on this issue and his
willingness to explore the implications of government efforts to impose
content regulations on interactive media. 

<p>
SENATOR LEAHY'S LETTER TO INTERACTIVE WORKING GROUP  
<p>
March 15, 1995
<p>
Mr. Jerry Berman<br>
Interactive Working Group<br>
Center for Democracy and Technology<br>
1001 G St., NW<br>
Suite 700 East<br>
Washington, DC 2000<br>
<p>
Dear Mr. Berman:<p>

<p> Interactive communications media are growing at an astonishing rate,
promising great advances for domestic commerce, international
competitiveness, and political and cultural life. Nearly ten years ago, we
began work on the Electronic Communications Priva cy Act ("ECPA"), in
recognition of the fact that new computer and communications technologies
would only flourish in an environment where the privacy rights of users,
the intellectual property rights of content providers, and the obligations
of service pr oviders are clear under statute. We continued that work last
year in the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act ("CALEA").
Today, as interactive communications systems expand in the consumer
market, there is a critical need to clarify the First Amendment rights and
responsibilities of information providers, users and carriers. 

<p> As you know, a number of bills have been introduced in the Senate that
would regulate a wide range of controversial content on interactive
information services, including the Internet. This legislation is
motivated by two important goals. First, parents s hould be able to
control their children's access to controversial material. Second, adult
users should be able to exercise reasonable control over the information
they receive so they may avoid material offense to them. The proposed
legislative solutions to achieve these goals raise serious concerns about
the free flow of information in new communications media, and threaten to
squelch the development of the Internet and a vital new industry along
with it. 

<p> I understand that industry and public interest organizations have
independently come together to form the Interactive Working Group in order
to address these issues. My hope is that the group will explore public
policy and technology options for addressin g the problems of children's
access to obscene content in a manner which promotes parental empowerment
and First Amendment values. I would appreciate the Interactive Working
group Consideration of and recommendation on the following issues: 

<p> 1. THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE: <p> What
effect will content regulation have on the development of the national and
global information infrastructure, including the Internet and other
interactive services?  

<p> 2. CURRENT LAW AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS: <p>

What is the current lawregulating obscenity and harassment online? What
gaps, if any, are there in current federal and state laws which hamper
prosecution of criminal activity, including violations of the copyright
and obscenity laws, in interactive media ?  

<p> 3. TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS: 

<p> Does interactive technology enable parents to control their children's
access to information in online services today? If not, what steps would
be required to enable such parental control? Can the Working Group provide
demonstrations of these user control technologies?  

<p> 4. CONSTITUTIONAL FREE SPEECH AND PRIVACY ISSUES: 

<p> What are the First Amendment implications of content regulation in
interactive media? What is the impact of carrier liability for content on
ECPA , CALEA and constitutional privacy protections? 

<p> Since the passage of the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act, and again in CALEA, we have always worked to
assure a proper balance of constitutional liberties, competitiveness and
legitimate government interest in the regulation of new communications te
chnologies. As I receive input from a number of sources on these important
issues, I look forward to your advice as well. My staff is available to
meet with members of your group to discuss these issues further.  

<p>
Sincerely, 

<p> [sig] <p> Patrick J. Leahy United States Senator

<center><h3>CDT LED COALITION SENDS LETTER TO<br>

SENATORS EXON AND PRESSLER <p></h3>

<b>MESSAGE:  <blink>REMOVE S. 314 FROM FAST TRACK</blink></b></center>





<p>The Interactive Working Group (a coalition of public interest 

organizations, members of the computer and communications industry, and 

associations representing librarians and the press, chaired by the 

Center For Democracy and Technology) today sent a letter to Senators 

Pressler, Exon, and the Senate Commerce Committee. The letter expresses 

serious concerns about S. 314 (the "Communications Decency Act of 1995") 

from the standpoint of the First Amendment and the viability of the 

entire communications industry. Because of these and other concerns, the 

coalition asked Senator Pressler and Exon not to incorporate S. 314 into 

Senate telecommunications reform legislation which is expected to be 

introduced later this month.<p>



The letter and a list of signatories are attached below. <p>



S. 314 would expand current law restricting indecency and harassment on 

telephone services to all telecommunications providers and expand 

criminal liability to all content carried by all forms of 

telecommunications networks. The bill would amend Section 223 of the 

Communications Act (47 U.S.C. 223), which requires carriers to take 

steps to prevent minors from gaining access to indecent audiotext and 

criminalizes harassment accomplished over interstate telephone lines.<p>



If enacted, S. 314 would compel service providers to severely restrict 

your online activities. Your access to email, discussion lists, usenet, 

the world wide web, gopher, and ftp archives would be substantially 

reduced or cut off entirely. The bill would also force providers to 

closely monitor and pre-screen your electronic mail, and refuse to 

transmit any message or other content which may be considered to be 

indecent.<p>



This bill poses a significant threat to freedom of speech and the free 

flow of information in cyberspace. The bill also raises fundamental 

questions about the right of government to control content on 

communications networks, as well as the locus of liability for content 

carried in these new communications media.

<center><b>INTERACTIVE WORKING GROUP LETTER</b></center><p>





March 2, 1995<p>



Chairman Larry Pressler<br>

Senate Commerce Committee<br>

United States Senate

Washington, DC<p>



Senator James Exon<br>

United States Senate<br>

528 Hart Senate Office Building<br>

Washington, DC<p>



Dear Chairman Pressler and Senator Exon:<p> 



We write regarding the Communications Decency Act of 1995 (S. 314), 

introduced recently by Senator James Exon and Senator Slade Gorton. We 

request that such legislation not be considered as part of the fast 

track telecommunications reform measure now before the Commerce 

Committee. The undersigned members of the computer and communications 

industry, the press, and the public interest community believe that this 

legislation raises fundamental questions regarding the involvement of 

government in content regulation in new interactive media. <p>



Developing means for detecting and holding wrong-doers responsible for 

illegal activity, and permitting parents to control access by their 

children to adult material while still preserving our constitutional 

liberties, are important goals shared by many in our society. However, 

the choice of methods for achieving these goals raises serious free 

speech and censorship problems. Our commitment is to work with you and 

your colleagues to resolve these issues in ways which will enable 

individual and parental choice, without impairing the free flow of 

information or stifling development of emerging technology through 

bureaucratic regulation.<p>



In recognition of the seriousness of these issues, the undersigned 

organizations have formed a working group to identify legal and 

regulatory options that maximize parental control, individual 

accountability, and the free flow of information in new communication 

technologies. We are encouraged that new interactive communications 

technologies -- including online services and interactive television 

offered by cable, telephone companies, and others in the public sector 

-- already offer technological means to give consumers choice over the 

content that they receive and enable parents to control access to 

controversial material. Many more such features are in development. 

Market signals already indicate to those of us who are building the 

Information Superhighway that users want choice of programming and 

control over the materials to which their children are exposed. 

Information providers in the public and private sector are working to 

meet these needs.<p>



We plan to devote intensive effort toward developing comprehensive 

solutions to the problems raised by S. 314. Desirable solutions will 

take advantage of the empowering potential of new technology for 

increased user control over programming and information content. 

However, we must emphasize that we strongly disagree with the approach 

embodied in this legislation that would in effect require those who 

merely provide the means of transmitting messages to censor the content 

of such materials, as well as become liable for the criminal actions of 

others based solely on the content of the messages transmitted. Applying 

the regulatory models developed for today's mass media to the 

interactive media of tomorrow, will only serve to thwart the development 

of new media.<p>



In the coming year, we hope to have the opportunity to work diligently 

with you and other policy makers to assure that the empowering potential 

of interactive media is achieved, and to arrive at comprehensive, 

forward looking solutions to the issues before us without jeopardizing 

fundamental First Amendment values.<p>

<i>This document may be re-distributed freely provided it remains in its

<p>

<b>X9 COMMITTEE AGREES TO DEVELOP 3x DES ENCRYPTION STANDARD</b><p> 



<b>Major Setback for NSA</b><p>



The NSA's efforts to push the adoption the Clipper/Skipjack government-

escrowed encryption scheme encountered a major setback earlier this 

month with the decision by the Accredited Standards Committee X9 to 

proceed with the development of a data security standard based on 

triple-DES.<p> 



The ASC X9 committee is responsible for setting data security standards 

for the US banking and financial services industries. These industries 

are heavy users of commercial cryptography, and standards developed for 

this community tend to drive the development of applications for the 

entire market. As a result, the committee's decision to proceed with a 

triple-DES standard has important implications for future cryptographic 

standards and US cryptography policy generally.<p>



The NSA, a voting member of the X9 committee, had lobbied hard against 

the proposal. In a November letter to committee members, the NSA 

threatened to prevent the export of triple- DES, citing existing US law 

and potential threats to national security (see attached NSA letter).<p>



The decision sets the stage for the development of a next generation of 

security standards based on publicly available, non-escrowed encryption 

schemes. A battle over the exportability of triple-DES applications is 

also on the horizon.<p>



Through export controls on cryptography, the proposed Clipper 

initiative, and interference in the standards setting processes, US 

government policies have consistently sought to make strong encryption 

and other privacy protecting technologies unavailable to the general 

public. The X9 decision and development of triple-DES and other 

alternitives to government-escrowed cryptography is an important victory 

in that it will increase the public's access to strong, privacy 

enhancing technologies.<p>

<b>BACKGROUND</b><p>



Banks and other financial institutions use encryption to protect the 

billions of dollars in transactions and fund transfers which flow every 

day across the world's communications networks.<p>



The current encryption standard used by the banking industry is based on 

DES, which has been available since the early 1970's. DES is widely 

trusted because it has been repeatedly tested and is considered by 

experts to be unbreakable except by brute force (trying every possible 

key combination). The US government has also allowed the limited export 

of DES. <p>



Despite its popularity, DES is considered to be reaching the end of its 

useful life. The increasing speed and sophistication of computer 

processing power has begun to render DES vulnerable to brute force 

attacks. Cryptographers have recently demonstrated that DES codes can be 

cracked in as little as three hours with $1 million worth of currently 

available equipment. As a result, the banking and financial services 

industries have begun to explore alternatives to DES.<p>



Although there are many potential alternatives to DES, triple-DES is 

widely seen as the most practical solution. Triple-DES is based on DES, 

but has been enhanced by increasing the key length and by encrypting 

through multiple iterations. These enhancements make triple-DES less 

vulnerable to brute force attacks. Triple-DES is also popular because it 

can be easily incorporated into existing DES systems and is based on 

standards and procedures familiar to most users.<p>



<b>NSA SETBACK IS A VICTORY FOR CLIPPER OPPONENTS </b><p>



In their November letter to X9 committee members, the NSA attempted to 

undermine the attractiveness of triple-DES by arguing that it is 

cryptographically unsound, a potential threat to national security, and 

would not be exportable under US law. The NSA, while offering no 

specific alternative to triple-DES, seemed to be attempting to push the 

committee to adopt the only currently available option -- Clipper.<p>



Privacy advocates also lobbied the X9 committee. In a letter sent in 

advance of the December 1994 ballot, CDT Deputy Director Daniel Weitzner 

(then EFF Deputy Policy Director) and EFF board member John Gilmore, an 

expert in this field, sent a letter to X9 committee members urging them 

to adopt the triple-DES standard. A copy of the letter is appended at 

the end of this post.<p>



By agreeing to develop a triple-DES standard, the X9 committee has 

clearly and decisively rejected Clipper as a solution. This vote thus 

represents a further repudiation to Clipper and yet another victory for 

opponents of government efforts to establish Clipper or other 

government-escrowed solutions as a national standard.<p>



<b>NEXT STEPS</b><p>



X9F, a subcommittee of the X9 committee, will now develop technical 

standards for implementing triple-DES based applications. This process 

is expected to take one or two years to complete. Once technical 

standards are developed, the full X9 committee will vote as to whether 

to implement the subcommittee's technical recommendations. <p>



The availability of triple-DES applications received a further boost 

recently with the announcement by AT&T and VLSI Technologies that they 

were developing new data security products based on triple-DES. This 

will presumably provide additional options for X9 committee members, but 

the exportability of these products is still in doubt. <p>



The stage is thus set for a further battle between the NSA and the X9 

committee over the exportability of triple-DES and final approval of the 

X9 standard. As a sitting member of the committee, NSA will presumably 

continue to lobby against efforts by the committee to develop triple-DES 

applications. Furthermore, the banking and financial services industries 

must still persuade the government to allow for the export of triple-

DES.<p>



As an opponent of government-escrowed cryptography, CDT applauds the 

recent actions of the X9 committee. While CDT supports the development 

of a variety of security standards and alternatives to DES, we recognize 

the need of the banking and financial services industries to develop 

temporary stop- gap solution. CDT will continue to work towards the 

relaxation of export controls on cryptography and will support X9 

committee members in their efforts to gain the ability to export triple-

<b>GILMORE/WEITZNER LETTER TO X9 COMMITTEE MEMBERS </b><p>



November 18, 1994<p>



Dear Accredited Standards Committee-X9 Member: <p>



The X9 Committee is currently voting as to whether to recommend the 

development of a standard for triple-DES (ballot number X9/94-LB#28). 

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) strongly urges you to vote in 

favor of the triple-DES standard. <p>



EFF supports the development of a variety of new data security standards 

and alternatives to DES. We believe the triple-DES standard provides the 

best immediate short term alternative because: <p>



<ul>

<li>The basic algorithm, DES, is strong and has been tested repeatedly.<p>



<li>There are no known attacks that succeed against triple-DES.<p>



<li>It is clearly no less secure than DES. <p>



<li>It eliminates the brute-force problem completely by tripling the key length.<p>



<li>It runs at high speeds in easy-to-build chips.<p> 



<li>It can be easily incorporated into existing systems.<p>

</ul>





NSA's opposition to triple-DES appears to be an indirect attempt to push 

Clipper by eliminating credible alternatives. Clipper is not a viable 

alternative to triple-DES, and carries substantial liabilities. There 

has been no evidence of foreign acceptance of the standard and the 

skipjact algorithm is classified. The likelihood of any government 

accepting secret standards developed by a foreign security agency is 

slim. Clinton Administration efforts, through the NSA, to push Clipper 

as a domestic standard over the past two years have failed. <p>



We urge you to carefully consider the alternatives before you cast your 

ballot. We believe that the triple-DES issue should be decided on its 

own merits.<p>



Sincerely,<p>



John Gilmore<br>

Board of Directors<br>

<b>NSA LETTER TO X9 COMMITTEE MEMBERS</b><p>



X9 Member:<p>



I will be casting a NO vote on the NWI for triple-DES, Letter Ballot 

X9/94-LB#28. The reasons are set forth below. You may find these useful 

as you determine your position. <p>



Jerry Rainville<p>



<b>NSA REASONS FOR A NEGATIVE VOTE</b><p>



While NSA supports the use of DES in the global financial sector, we 

believe that standardization of triple-DES is ill- advised for a number 

of reasons.<p>



The financial community should be planning to transition to a new 

generation of cryptographic algorithms. When DES was first introduced, 

it represented the "only game in town". It supported encryption, 

authentication, key management, and secure hashing applications. With a 

broader interest in security, the market can now support optimized 

algorithms by application. Going through the expense of installing a 

stop- gap can only serve to delay progress in achieving interoperable 

universal appropriate solutions. <p>



While we understand the appeal of a snap-in upgrade, our experience has 

been that any change is expensive, especially one where the requirements 

on the key management system change. We do not agree that replacing DES 

with triple-DES is significantly less expensive than upgrading to more 

appropriate technology.<p>



Tripling of any algorithm is cryptographically unsound. Notice that 

tripling DES, at best, only doubles the length of the cryptovariable 

(key). Phrased another way, the DES was optimized for security at 56 

bits. We cannot vouch that any of the schemes for doubling the 

cryptovariable length of DES truly squares security.<p>



We understand the financial community has concerns with current key 

escrow based encryption, however, we are committed to searching for 

answers to those concerns. But the government is also committed to key 

escrow encryption, and we do not believe that the proposal for triple 

DES is consistent with this objective.<p>



US export control policy does not allow for general export of DES for 

encryption, let alone triple-DES. Proceeding with this NWI would place 

X9 at odds with this long standing policy. It also violates the newly 

accepted X9 cryptographic policy.<p>



The US government has not endorsed triple-DES; manufacturers and users 

may be reluctant to use triple-DES products for fear of possible 

liability.<p>



Finally, further proliferation of triple-DES is counter to national 

security and economic objectives. We would welcome the opportunity to 

discuss these concerns with an appropriate executive of your 

institution.<p>

CDT POLICY POST 2/9/95<p>



<h3>SUBJECT:<br>

SENATOR EXON INTRODUCES ONLINE INDECENCY LEGISLATION</h3>





<b>A.	OVERVIEW</b><p>



Senators Exon (D-NE) and Senator Gorton (R-WA) have introduced 

legislation to expand current FCC regulations on obscene and indecent 

audiotext to cover *all* content carried over all forms of electronic 

communications networks. If enacted, the "<a href="///policy/legis/!s314.bil">Communications Decency Act of 

1995" (S. 314)</a> would place substantial criminal liability on 

telecommunications service providers (including telephone networks, 

commercial online services, the Internet, and independent BBS's) if 

their network is used in the transmission of any indecent, lewd, 

threatening or harassing messages. The legislation is identical to a 

proposal offered by Senator Exon last year which failed along with the 

Senate Telecommunications reform bill (S. 1822, 103rd Congress, Sections 

801 - 804). The <a href = "#text"> text of the proposed statute, with proposed amendment</a>, is appended at the end of this document.<p> 



The bill would compel service providers to chose between severely 

restricting the activities of their subscribers or completely shutting 

down their email, Internet access, and conferencing services under the 

threat of criminal liability. Moreover, service providers would be 

forced to closely monitor every private communication, electronic mail 

message, public forum, mailing list, and file archive carried by or 

available on their network, a proposition which poses a substantial 

threat to the freedom of speech and privacy rights of all American 

citizens.<p>



S. 314, if enacted, would represent a tremendous step backwards on the 

path to a free and open National Information Infrastructure. The bill 

raises fundamental questions about the ability of government to control 

content on communications networks, as well as the locus of liability 

for content carried in these new communications media. <p>



To address this threat to the First Amendment in digital media, CDT is 

working to organize a broad coalition of public interest organizations 

including the ACLU, People For the American Way, and Media Access 

Project, along with representatives from the telecommunications, online 

services, and computer industries to oppose S. 314 and to explore 

alternative policy solutions that preserve the free flow of information 

and freedom of speech in the online world. CDT believes that 

technological alternatives which allow individual subscribers to control 

the content they receive represent a more appropriate approach to this 

issue.<p> 





<b>B.	SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS OF S. 314</b><p>



S. 314 would expand current law restricting indecency and harassment on 

telephone services to all telecommunications providers and expand 

criminal liability to *all* content carried by *all* forms of 

telecommunications networks. The bill would amend Section 223 of the 

Communications Act (47 U.S.C. 223), which requires carriers to take 

steps to prevent minors from gaining access to indecent audiotext and 

criminalizes harassment accomplished over interstate telephone lines. 

This section, commonly known as the Helms Amendment (having been 

championed by Senator Jesse Helms), has been the subject of extended 

constitutional litigation in recent years.<p>



<i>CARRIERS LIABLE FOR CONDUCT OF ALL USERS ON THEIR

NETWORKS<p></i>



S. 314 would make telecommunication carriers (including telephone 

companies, commercial online services, the Internet, and BBS's) liable 

for every message, file, or other content carried on its network -- 

including the private conversations or messages exchanged between two 

consenting individuals.<p>



Under S. 314, anyone who "makes, transmits, or otherwise makes available 

any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other 

communication" which is "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" 

using a "telecommunications device" would be subject to a fine of 

$100,000 or two years in prison (Section (2)(a)).<p>



In order to avoid liability under this provision, carriers would be 

forced to pre-screen all messages, files, or other content before 

transmitting it to the intended recipient. Carriers would also be forced 

to prevent or severely restrict their subscribers from communicating 

with individuals and accessing content available on other networks. <p>



Electronic communications networks do not contain discrete boundaries. 

Instead, users of one service can easily communicate with and access 

content available on other networks. Placing the onus, and criminal 

liability, on the carrier as opposed to the originator of the content, 

would make the carrier legally responsible not only for the conduct of 

its own subscribers, but also for content generated by subscribers of 

other services.<p>



This regulatory scheme clearly poses serious threats to the free flow of 

information throughout the online world and the free speech and privacy 

rights of individual users. Forcing carriers to pre-screen content would 

not only be impossible due to the sheer volume of messages, it would 

also violate current legal protections.<p>



<i>CARRIERS REQUIRED TO ACT AS PRIVATE CENSOR OF ALL PUBLIC FORUMS AND ARCHIVES</i><p>



S. 314 would also expand current restrictions on access to indecent 

telephone audiotext services by minors under the age of 18 to cover 

similar content carried by telecommunications services (such as America 

Online and the Internet). (Sec (a)(4)).<p>



As amended by this provision, anyone who, "by means of telephone or 

telecommunications device, makes, transmits, or otherwise makes 

available (directly or by recording device) any indecent communication 

for commercial purposes which is available to any person under the age 

of 18 years of age or to any other person without that person's consent, 

regardless of whether the maker of such communication placed the call or 

initiated the communication" would be subject of a fine of $100,000 or 

two years in prison.<p>



This would force carries to act as private censors of all content available in public forums or file archives on their networks. Moreover, 

because there is no clear definition of indecency, carriers would have 

to restrict access to any content that could be possibly construed as 

indecent or obscene under the broadest interpretation of the term. 

Public forums, discussion lists, file archives, and content available 

for commercial purposes would have to be meticulously screened and 

censored in order to avoid potential liability for the carrier.<p>



Such a scenario would severely limit the diversity of content available 

on online networks, and limit the editorial freedom of independent forum 

operators.<p>



<b>ADDITIONAL NOTABLE PROVISIONS</b><p>



<i>AMENDMENT TO ECPA</i><p>



Section (6) of the bill would amend the Electronic Communications 

Privacy Act (18 USC 2511) to prevent the unauthorized interception and 

disclosure of "digital communications" (Sec. 6). However, because the 

term "digital communication" is not defined and 18 USC 2511 currently 

prevents unauthorized interception and disclosure of "electronic 

communications" (which includes electronic mail and other forms of 

communications in digital form), the effect of this provision has no 

clear importance.<p> 



<i>CABLE OPERATORS MAY REFUSE INDECENT PUBLIC ACCESS 

PROGRAMMING</i><p>



Finally, section (8) would amend sections 611 and 612 of the 

Communications Act (47 USC 611 - 612) to allow any cable operator to 

refuse to carry any public access or leased access programming which 

contains "obscenity, indecency, or nudity".<p>



<b>C.  ALTERNATIVES TO EXON: RECOGNIZE THE UNIQUE USER CONTROL

CAPABILITIES OF INTERACTIVE MEDIA</b><p>



Government regulation of content in the mass media has always been 

considered essential to protect children from access to sexually-

explicit material, and to prevent unwitting listeners/views from being 

exposed to material that might be considered extremely distasteful. The 

choice to protect children has historically been made at the expense of 

the First Amendment ban on government censorship. As Congress moves to 

regulate new interactive media, it is essential that it understand that 

interactive media is different than mass media. The power and 

flexibility of interactive media offers a unique opportunity to enable 

parents to control what content their kids have access to, and leave the 

flow of information free for those adults who want it. Government 

control regulation is simply not needed to achieve the desired purpose.<p>



Most interactive technology, such as Internet browsers and the software 

used to access online services such as America Online and Compuserve, 

already has the capability to limit access to certain types of services 

and selected information. Moreover, the electronic program guides being 

developed for interactive cable TV networks also provide users the 

capability to screen out certain channels or ever certain types of 

programming. Moreover, in the online world, most content (with the 

exception of private communications initiated by consenting individuals) 

is transmitted by request. In other words, users must seek out the 

content they receive, whether it is by joining a discussion or accessing 

a file archive. By its nature, this technology provides ample control at 

the user level. Carriers (such as commercial online services, Internet 

service providers) in most cases act only as "carriers" of electronic 

transmissions initiated by individual subscribers.<p>



CDT believes that the First Amendment will be better served by giving 

parents and other users the tools to select which information they (and 

their children) should have access to. In the case of criminal content 

the originator of the content, not the carriers, should be responsible 

for their crimes. And, users (especially parents) should be empowered to 

determine what information they and their children have access to. If 

all carriers of electronic communications are forced restrict content in 

order to avoid criminal liability proposed by S. 314, the First 

Amendment would be threatened and the usefulness of digital media for 

communications and information dissemination would be drastically 

limited. <p>





<b>D.	NEXT STEPS</b><p>



The bill has been introduced and will next move to the Senate Commerce 

Committee, although no Committee action has been scheduled. Last year, a 

similar proposal by Senator Exon was approved by the Senate Commerce 

committee as an amendment to the Senate Telecommunications Bill (S. 

1822, which died at the end of the 103rd Congress). CDT will be working 

with a wide range of other interest groups to assure that Congress does 

not restrict the free flow of information in interactive media.<p>

Re:     Constitutional Analysis of "Communications Decency Act" (S.314)<br>
From:     Center for Democracy and Technology and People for the American Way<br>
Date:     March 21, 1995
<hr size = 2>
<p>
<h3>I.	Overview</h3>
<p>
	The Communications Decency Act (S.314) was introduced to promote the laudable purpose of protecting minors from access to controversial and inappropriate sexually explicit material in interactive media including the Internet, other commercial online services, and electronic bulletin board services.  However, because the proposed statute is grafted onto a twenty five year old provision of the Communications Act which was designed for a centralized monopoly telephone environment, instead of diverse, decentralized interactive media, it both fails to accomplish its goal and is unconstitutional on its face.  
<p>
	Most importantly, the legislation fails to take advantage of the empowering aspects of new interactive media, which can allow parents and other users to exercise control over the information that to which they and their children have access.  This memorandum will suggest an alternative means for achieving the purpose outlined by Senator Exon and will show that the proposed Act suffers from the following constitutional infirmities:
<p>
<ol>
<li><em>Overbreadth and Vagueness:</em>  The Act criminalizes not only obscene, but also "lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" communications, all of which are protected by the First Amendment and cannot be banned.  
<p>
<li><em>Impermissible intrusive means of achieving legitimate goal: </em>First Amendment jurisprudence requires that restrictions on speech adopt the "least restrictive means" available for achieving a compelling purpose.  Relying on technological assumptions applicable only to 900 number services and a centrally-controlled telephone system, the Act fails to account for the fact that government restriction on content is unnecessary in interactive media, where parents can control the content that their children access.
<p>
<li><em>Faulty analogy to broadcast media:</em>  Proponents of the Act have justified the constitutionality by improper reliance on content restrictions found acceptable in the broadcast media.  These arguments fail to recognize that while broadcast media may "assault" unwilling listeners, who may be in need of government protection, interactive media enables users to control the information that they receive.
<p>
<li><em>Invasion of privacy: </em> By criminalizing the content of private, non-obscene messages, the Act would force an invasion of the realm of private electronic communications and end the individual's ability to control the content of information he or she chooses to access in private.
<p>
<li><em>Creation of private censors:</em> Holding service providers criminally-liable for the content of all messages that they carry will force providers to become private censors and prescreen all communications traveling across their system.</li></ol>
<p>
	In simple terms, the Communications Decency Act would enshrine in statute a sharp distinction between the print medium and new interactive media.  For example, though an individual is allowed to go into a bookstore and buy a sexually-explicit magazine or a "lewd" work of art, one would not be able to access the identical information over the Internet.  Both the interactive media and the print media are arenas in which individuals and organizations exercise core First Amendment free speech rights.  Before Congress elects to diminish the First Amendment protections available in this new medium, we believe that careful, public consideration is required.
<p>
	Legislating about new interactive media requires a careful understanding of the unique attributes of this new medium.  First and foremost, interactive media enable users (including parents) to exercise choice over the information that they and their children have access to.  In sharp contrast to older media, government content regulation is simply not necessary in order to shield children from possibly inappropriate information.  Furthermore, given the heavily fact-based determination required to justify regulation of indecency, legislative findings based on open hearings and a public record are essential before any legislation could pass constitutional muster.  In light of the serious constitutional concerns raised about the Act, and the danger that it poses for the development of a vital new communications medium, we believe that it is essential that the Senate and House hold hearings before taking any further action on this bill.
<p>
<h3>II.	General prohibition against indecent and obscene 				communications is unconstitutional</h3>
<p>
	If enacted, Subsection (a) of  the Communications Decency Act of 1995, which amends Section 223 of the Communication Act, would violate the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States because it includes an outright ban on making any "comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image or other communication" by means of a "telecommunications device" if that communication is "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent."   
<p>
	The failure of the statute to distinguish between obscenity and several other categories of speech -- i.e. lewd, lascivious, filthy or indecent -- makes the proposed legislation constitutionally infirm.  <em>Sable Communications, Inc. v. FCC</em> 492 U.S. 115 (1989).   As articulated below, a total ban on constitutionally protected speech in a media that permits user selection as to that which he or she chooses to receive is unconstitutional.  
<p>
	The principle that each person should decide for him or herself the "ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration and adherence" lies at the heart of the First Amendment. <em>Turner Broadcasting v. FCC</em> , 114 U.S. 2445 (1994)  This principle has been interpreted to mean that individuals should be able to speak freely and frankly about issues of their choosing, without fear of reprisal because many people may not agree with or appreciate the nature and content of their messages.  At the same time, the Supreme Court has recognized that despite this fundamental guarantee, there are certain kinds of speech that fall into a category of unprotected speech -- obscenity is one such category, indecency is not.1  
<p>
	Because of the difficulty is defining obscenity in the context of the First Amendment, it took numerous attempts for the Supreme Court to find five justices to agree on defining principles. 2  Finally, in 1973 the Supreme Court in <em>Miller v. California</em>, 3 established the definition of obscenity and the narrow area of sexually explicit speech that is unprotected by the Constitution.4  Since that time, the definition has not been expanded or changed.
<p>
	By contrast, indecent speech which may include important political views, even if crudely stated, is protected by the First Amendment.  As such, government cannot enact a ban on the speech without illustrating a compelling governmental interest, and restricting such speech in the least restrictive manner.5  The ban on indecent communications in subsection (a) of the proposed amendment to Section 223 of the Communications applies to point-to-point communications between users of telecommunications devices.  In other words, it applies to each and every one of the millions of  messages sent between individuals by way of  electronic mail every day over both public and private computer networks.  And, it is beyond question that there is no recognized compelling governmental interest in protecting consenting individuals from exchanging "indecent, lewd or lascivious" words.
<p>
	Indeed, we can find no case law in which a federal court has ever enforced even the existing statute regarding telephone communications to cover communications between consenting adults.  Courts have analyzed 223(a) only in the context of "harassing" communications which, by their very nature, include a nonconsensual element.  Given this fact, there are numerous dangers inherent in expanding the reach of 233(a) to electronic communications where the provision may apply not only to communications between individuals but also to electronic messages appearing on public bulletin boards where individuals convene in virtual communities.  Admittedly, it would theoretically be possible for a court  simply to attempt to  "rewrite" the Communications Decency Act to correct one constitutional infirmity of the bill by reading in a lack of consent requirement. However, even such a rewrite would likely not make 223(a) constitutional as applied to new media and would represent a mistaken and overreaching use of  judicial resources particularly when Congress has the power to enact constitutional legislation and is on notice that the existing  plain language of  Section 223(a) is flawed.
<p>
<h3>III.	Restrictions on indecent communications are unconstitutional 		for failure to adopt least restrictive means</h3>
<p>
	As amended by S.314, 223(b) of the Communications Act would extend criminal penalties for all who "make, transmit, or make available," indecent materials which are accessible on a commercial basis to people under age 18.  This addition to  223(b) targets those who provide access to the Internet, commercial online services, and all electronic bulletin board systems.  Under this new provision, both the author of the information, and any entity involved in the distribution of the material would be criminally liable.  The current statute and associated Federal Communications Commission regulations does provide a safe harbor against prosecution for those providers who either 1) verify in writing through the US Mail that the person requesting the communication is over 18, 2) require payment by credit card for each piece of information accessed, or 3) deliver the information in scrambled form such that it can only be unscrambled with a device made available by providers upon prior age verification.  See 47 USC  223(b) and 47 CFR  64.201.
<p>
	A key legislative motivation for imposing these rules during the 1980s was that indecent information available through audiotext services in the telephone system were openly available to children in such a way that it was difficult for parents to control access by their children.  The views of Congressman Bliley recounts the prevailing view of the need for the legislation: "It constitutes an ATTRACTIVE NUISANCE in every home in America where children are present. There is no completely effective way to prevent children from being exposed to "indecent" or "obscene" dial-a-porn so long as it is lawfully and commercially marketed. . . ."  Bliley continues:
<p>
<blockquote>"Telephones are precisely like radio and television because of their easy accessibility to children and the virtual impossibility for parents to monitor their use . . . . [D]ial-a-porn is presently in the home whether the homeowner wants it or not.  Today one cannot have telephone service in the privacy of one's family environment without being required to [have] dial-a-porn with it. Families with children must give up telephone service to be "left alone" from exposure of their children to this intruder."6</blockquote>
<p>
	The current statute and Federal Communications Commission regulations promulgated thereunder were found constitutional after nearly ten years of litigation and efforts by Congress and the Commission to bring the statute within constitutionally acceptable bounds. Notwithstanding the narrow finding of constitutionality in the case of the current statute, the changes proposed by the Act require a wholesale review of the constitutionality as applied to new, interactive media such as online services and the Internet.  Interactive media operates in such a different manner, that the constitutional issues must be considered afresh given the new factual backdrop.  We argue here that the current rules, as amended by S.314, would be found unconstitutional in interactive media given the standards set out by the courts reviewing the  223 rules as they applied to older telephone technology.
<p>
<b>A. 	Censorship of indecent, but not obscene, communications for the purpose of protecting minors must employ the least restrictive means available to accomplish their goal</b>
<p>
	Indecent communications are protected by the First Amendment, unlike obscenity which is altogether unprotected.  <em>Sable Communications of California v. FCC</em>, 492 US 115; 109 S.Ct. 2829; 106 L.Ed. 2d 93 (1989).  However, indecent communications, which do not rise to the level of obscenity,7 can only be limited in order to serve a compelling state purpose and must be done using the least restrictive means possible.  <em>Id</em>. at 125.  The <em>Sable</em> court found that the protection of minors from access to indecent material is a compelling state purpose, but that "it is not enough that the Government's ends are compelling; the means must be carefully tailored to achieve those ends." <em>Id</em>.8  
<p>
	As a threshold matter, the <em>Sable</em> court found that the constitutional basis for upholding indecency regulations in broadcast media articulated in <em>Pacifica Foundation v. FCC</em>, 438 US 726, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 57 L.ED. 2d 1073 (1978), were inapplicable in any other media besides over-the-air broadcasting.9  492 U.S. at 127.  Pacifica upheld the FCC content regulation based on the dual finding that 1) radio was a "uniquely pervasive medium"10 that intruded (dirty words and all) into peoples homes, and 2) the only way to protect children from exposure to objectionable content was to keep it off the air altogether.11  Sable rejects this finding of "pervasiveness" as "emphatically narrow" and irrelevant to other media such as telephone audiotext services. 492 U.S. at 127
<p>
	Thus, the <em>Sable</em>"least restrictive means" standard became the test by which all regulations on access to constitutionally protected indecent material were judged.  Nearly ten years of litigation along with adjustment of statute and regulation was required before the current statute was found constitutional under this standard.  See <em>Dial Information Services v. Thornburg</em>, 938 F.2d 1535 (2d Cir., 1991)(finding FCC regulations implementing  223(b) constitutional).  During the course of the dispute over the application of  223 to audiotext services, courts considered and rejected a number of means by which carriers were required to shield minors from access to indecent information.  First, time channeling rules, requiring that services only be accessible during hours when children were asleep, were found to violate the First Amendment because they had the effect of denying access to adults as well as children.  <em>Carlin Communications v. FCC</em>, 749 F.2d 113, 121 (2d Cir. 1984) (Carlin I).  Next, the courts rejected a requirement that carriers provide access to indecent services only once customers entered access codes or passwords, which were to be issued after verification that the customer was over 18. <em>Carlin Communications v. FCC</em>, 787 F.2d 846 (2d Cir. 1986)(Carlin II).
<p>
	The finding of the <em>Dial</em> court, approving the constitutionality of  223 and associated regulations depended on the legislative determination that the telephone company blocking of service pending age verification or use of a credit card are the only means to enable parents to restrict their children from access to indecent audiotext services.12  
<p>
<b>B.	Means chosen in S.314 of limiting access to online services fail to take into account the fact that interactive media offers parents a much greater degree of control then broadcast services or 900 number services.</b>
<p>
	While S.314 adopts the same goal of protecting minors as the existing statute, the means adopted for achieving the goal are impermissible under the First Amendment because they are not the least restrictive means of accomplishing the legitimate government purpose.  Interactive media is materially different than analog telephone and audiotext technology in that is offers users the ability to exercise control over precisely what information one accesses.  Given the dramatic difference between telephone technology and interactive services such as the Internet and other online services, we believe that blocking by the carrier as demanded by  223 and S.314 would not meet the "least restrictive means" test.  Just as the Sable court found broadcast indecency regulations inapplicable to the telephone system because of differences in the medium, regulations designed for audiotext services in the telephone system are constitutionally inapplicable to new interactive media.
<p>
	Technologies already exist that enable users to access certain information based on a variety of characteristics, or, to exclude certain types of information from access.  With such filtering technology, users, instead of the government or network operators, can exercise control over the information content that they receive in an interactive network environment.  User control could be exercised in two ways.  First, one could screen out all messages or programs based on information in the header.  If a parent wanted to prevent a child from seeing a particular movie or from participating in a particular online discussion group, then the computer or other information appliance used by the child could be set by the parent to screen out the objectionable content.  Such features can often be protected with passwords which would be assigned, for example, by the responsible adults in the house.  Second, the same systems can be used to enable blocking of content based on third-party rating systems.  For example, those parents who accept TV Guide's judgment about the presence of nudity and/or violence in particular programs, could program their interactive TV sets to screen out all programs that TV Guide has classified as violent.13  
<p>
	Given the flexibility of interactive technology, we need not rely on just one rating system.  In fact, a single rating system or a single set of filters would merely replace a single government censor with a single private censor, no real gain for the free flow of information.  Properly implemented, interactive media can accommodate multiple filtering systems, giving users and parents the opportunity to select and block information based on a true diversity of criteria.  The National Parent-Teachers Association or different religious organizations could set up rating systems which would be available on the network to those who desired them.  Rather than relying on the judgment of the government, or of the TV network, viewers can limit access to content based on the judgment of a group whose values they share.
<p>
	Interactive media can enable customers (in particular, parents) to prevent themselves or others using their PCs or TVs (in particular, their children) from accessing certain kinds of content.  With such control mechanisms within the practical reach of parents the governmental purpose generally cited for indecency regulations -- the protection of children -- could be accomplished without government content restrictions.  In particular, the reasoning of <em>Pacifica</em> (intrusion of the indecent message into homes) and <em>Sable</em> (inability of parents to exercise control) would no longer justify most content regulation.  
<p>
<b>IV.	Forcing  online service providers to become private censors impairs First Amendment values by restricting the free flow of information</b>
<p>
	Making carriers responsible for the content of all information and communication on their systems is a grave policy error which will restrict the free flow of information and is contrary to First Amendment values.  If service providers are held liable for all of the content on their networks, then they will be forced to attempt to screen all content before it is allowed to enter the system. In many cases, this would be simply impossible. But even where it is possible, such prescreening can severely limit the diversity and free flow of information in the online world. To be sure, some system operators will want to offer services that prescreen content. However, if all systems were forced to do so, the usefulness of digital media as communication and information dissemination systems would be drastically limited. Where possible, we must avoid legal structures that force those who merely carry messages to screen their content.
<p>
	Relying on user control is a real alternative to the draconian approach now being considered and sure to be proposed again and again.  A media environment in which parents -- or anyone else who has particular preferences about the content of information to which he or she is exposed -- would give users the control that courts have determined they lack in the mass media, without involving the government in content control which we believe would not survive appropriate First Amendment scrutiny in this new medium.
<p>
<b>V. 	Banning private, sexually-explicit communications violates constitutional privacy rights</b>
<p>
	S.314 seeks to regulate not only information that is made available in public, but also private communications between individuals.  The Supreme Court has also made clear that absolute restrictions on indecency or obscenity cannot pass constitutional muster under the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of personal privacy.  Though the Court has explicitly recognized that what the government may have an interest in protecting in public, <em>Paris Adult Theater I v. Slaton</em>, 413 U.S. 49 (1973) or in a place that caters to the public, <em>Schad v. Mt Ephraim</em>, 452 U.S. 61 (1981); <em>California v.LaRue</em>, 409 U.S. 109 (1972). it does not have a right to ban information maintained in private.  <em>Stanley v. Georgia</em>, 394 U.S. 557 (1969).  "If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his house, what books he may read or what films he may watch."  <em>Id</em>. at 598.  If enacted, S.314, would empower federal authorities to intrude on the private communications and information used by individuals, in clear violation of <em>Stanley</em>.  
<p>
	As reflected in passage of the Video Privacy and Library Protection Act of 1988 (protecting records of video rents), and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986 (18 U.S.C  2510), Congress has long recognized the privacy interest in information that we read and otherwise use.  A number of surveys have confirmed that America's care deeply about their privacy.  In a 1983 analysis of their survey results, Louis Harris & Associates concluded:
<p>
<blockquote>Particularly striking is the pervasiveness of support for tough new ground rules governing computers and other information technology . . . .  This support permeates all subgroups in society and represents a mandate for initiatives in public policy.  (L. Harris, The Road after 1984:  A Nationwide Survey of the Public and its Leader on the New Technology and its Consequences for American Life, December, 1983).</blockquote>
<p>
The plain meaning of the Communications Decency Act, however, requires that online service providers violate the privacy rights, and statutory protection established by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act in order to assure that criminal violations do not occur.  ECPA established that users of online communications systems have a substantial privacy interest in the communications that they transmit over computer networks.  ECPA also set out clear conditions under which law enforcement agencies, and, in narrow cases, system operators could access these private communications.  The provisions of S.314 would require a dramatic expansion of the access rules established in ECPA.  While there may be some justification for regulation of communication and information made public, or made available directly to minors, there must be no intrusion on private or closed group communications unless there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing.
<p>
<b>VI.	Constitutional alternatives to the Communications Decency Act censorship regime</b>
<p>
	Though the Communications Decency Act adopted means that we believe are unconstitutional, the goals espoused by Senator Exon are, indeed, important.  Alternative means of achieving the goal of protecting minors from access to material considered inappropriate by their parents would include:
<ul>
<li>Maximum reliance on technology to empower parents:  Interactive media offers parents and other users the ability to filter certain kinds of content.  Instead of relying on government censorship, or even government-imposed rating systems, parents should be able to block the delivery of certain information to their children.
<p>
<li>Clear protection for constitutionally-permissible speech:  Any alternative legislation must provide affirmative protection for constitutionally-permissible speech, even if it is lewd or filthy.  Controversial speech must be treated separately than that which is clearly obscene and unprotected.
<p>
<li>Emphasis on enforcement of existing statutes:  Federal and state law already prohibits transportation of obscenity, child pornography, as well as, in many instances threats, stalking and harassment.  To the extent that there are obstacles to enforcing these laws in the new on-line environment, Congress should examine whether new law is required, or whether more resources for enforcement (including training for law enforcement in interactive services and cooperative efforts with the industry).
<p>
<li>Codification separately from existing dial-a-porn statute:  Modification of the existing  223, originally written for the analog telephone system, to regulate new interactive media causes unnecessary confusion, both for the treatment of the new technology and with respect to the stability of the regulation of audiotext services.  If new law is written, it should stand on its own.  Moreover, Congress should consider which elements properly belong in the Communications Act and which in the Criminal Code.
</ul>
<p>
	The regulation of speech, commerce, and privacy rights in new interactive communications systems raises many difficult issues of public policy and constitutional law.  Before proceeding with legislation, Congress must provide the opportunity for public hearings to identify clearly the problems that exist, and to identify solutions that are appropriate to the new technology.  Failure to do so will result in ineffective policy, years of constitutional litigation, and a disastrous chilling effect on the development and growth of a very promising new communications medium.

12  Rep. Blilely asserts as much in his comments on the legislation.

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
The Center for Democracy and Technology believes that interactive communications
media such as the Internet hold great potential for enhancing democratic
values and supporting the full realization of individual freedoms. Policies
that support and encourage the development of technologies that give individuals
control over the ideas and beliefs to which they are exposed, and the collection,
use and disclosure of their personal information, will lay the foundation
for a robust, thriving democracy in the Digital Age. <BR>
<BR>
While optimistic about the privacy enhancing potential of the Digital Age,
we believe that the core privacy principles of notice and individual control
over personal information must inform the design of the information infrastructure
if this potential is to be fully realized. We have a window of opportunity
-- offering the chance to put privacy-enhancing technologies into the hands
of individuals. To realize this promise, all members of the Internet community
must come together to build an infrastructure that supports privacy policies
and applications.<BR>
<BR>
Our testimony offers a vision of an individual with the information and
tools to make decisions about the collection, use and disclosure of personal
information during each and every transaction on the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="#sec_1">Section I</A> sets the stage for a discussion of the Individual
Empowerment solution by providing an overview of privacy considerations
in the Digital Age. <A HREF="#sec_2">Sections II</A> and <A HREF="#sec_3">III</A>
outline our Individual Empowerment model and offer a number of models for
its implementation. <A HREF="#sec_4">Section IV</A> examines the application
of Individual Empowerment solutions to protecting children's privacy. Finally,
<A HREF="#sec_5">Section V</A> explores the potential of the Individual
Empowerment model to move the Internet towards compliance with the EU Directive.<BR>
<BR>
The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) is dedicated to preserving
and enhancing democratic values and civil liberties on the Internet and
other interactive communications media. CDT pursues its mission through
public education, grass roots organizing, litigation, and coalition building.
CDT is a non-profit, public interest organization (501 (c)(3)).<A NAME=

<H2>I. Privacy in the Digital Age</H2>
At its core, the Digital Age represents a dramatic shift in computing and
communication power. The decentralized, open nature of the network coupled,
with an emphasis on user control over information, are central to achieving
the First Amendment potential of the Internet. Through interactive technology,
individuals today can enjoy a here-to-fore unknown ability to exercise First
Amendment freedoms. Access to the Internet empowers individuals with an
enormous capacity to speak and be heard, and listen and learn. The development
of filtering and blocking devices that empower individuals to control the
inflow of information gives new meaning to the core First Amendment principle
that individuals should determine the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression,
consideration, and adherence.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_1">1</SUP></A><BR>
<BR>
However, at this moment the impact of the Digital Age on individual privacy
remains an open question. Will the Digital Age be a period in which individuals
lose all control over personal information? Or does the Digital Age offer
a renewed opportunity for privacy? The development of technologies that
empower individuals to control the collection and use of personal information
and communications -- such as encryption, and anonymous remailers, web browsers
and payment systems -- are inspiring examples of the privacy-enhancing possibilities
of interactive technology. However, we believe that the architecture of
the Internet must be designed to advance individual privacy by facilitating
individual control over personal information. <BR>
<BR>
The rise of technologies that empower users of interactive communications
media to affirmatively express control over personal information can fundamentally
shift the balance of power between the individual and those seeking information.
CDT believes this technological shift is possible and necessary, and offers
us an unprecedented opportunity to advance individual privacy. However,
this shift will only occur if interactive media is harnessed to advance
individual privacy.<BR>
<BR>
Rather than responding to the very real risks posed by new technology with
the Luddite-call of &quot;smash the machine,&quot; we are calling for a
reversal of the technological status quo by demanding that technology be
designed to empower people. We should seize the opportunity to vest individuals
with the information and tools to express their desire for privacy in clear
and effective ways, and have those desires acknowledged by information users,
we can advance privacy. We believe that this post-Luddite approach will
reinvigorate individual privacy in the Digital Age. <BR>
<BR>
While strengthening existing laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act
and the Right to Financial Privacy Act, and enacting legislation to protect
health records, are crucial to protecting individual privacy, individual
empowerment technologies offer a powerful method of implementing the core
principle of individual control where current gaps and weaknesses leave
individual privacy vulnerable. We believe that user controlled technologies
that enable individuals to protect the privacy of their communications and
personal information, offer an unprecedented opportunity to extend real
protections for individual privacy around the world. <A NAME="sec_1a"></A>
<H3>A. Privacy and Democracy</H3>
Understanding the value of privacy to individuals and society, and developing
the principles through which privacy can best be preserved is essential,
if we are to develop a cohesive, rational model for realizing individual
privacy on the Internet.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_2">2</SUP></A> We must understand
why preserving and enhancing privacy is an ultimate &quot;good,&quot; and
agree upon a set of privacy principles, before we can come to decisions
on how best to apply them to this new media.<BR>
<BR>
An emblem of a vibrant, participatory democracy is the ability of people
to develop as individuals, separate and distinct from one another, with
the confidence to hold and express their own political opinions, beliefs
and preferences. A free society tolerates -- even revels in -- such individuality,
recognizing it as the bedrock of an open society, as a necessary precursor
to free speech and political participation.<BR>
<BR>
People must be able to maintain some control over personal information in
order to fully realize other core values, including autonomy, liberty, free
expression and civic participation. This facet of privacy is uniquely implicated
in our move to interactive technology.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_3">3</A> </SUP> By
preserving privacy, society provides individuals with the solitude and isolation
necessary for the individual to develop her identity, form her own thoughts
and opinions, and establish intimate connections with others. Equally important,
privacy allows the individual to step forward to participate in the affairs
of society without losing all control over personal information. It is axiomatic
that an individual's willingness to engage in the activities of the community
will be tempered by the degree to which he or she is able to maintain control
over the development and presentation of one's self.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_4">4</SUP></A>
In the absence of control over the development of one's self, individual
autonomy and self-determination are eroded.<A NAME="sec_1b"></A>
<H3>B. Weakness of current privacy protections</H3>
A number of factors have contributed to the weak state of individual privacy
protection in the U.S. First, until fairly recently, technology has been
in the hands of the government and large corporations. It has been deployed
to meet governmental needs -- often the need to monitor, survey, and track
individuals -- using increasingly invasive techniques. Similarly, technology
has been used by businesses to collect information on individuals often
without their knowledge or consent and, frequently, to use personal information
collected for one purpose to make decisions about the individual in unrelated
contexts. <BR>
<BR>
Second, in the U.S., privacy protections for personal information are incomplete
and scattered throughout case law<SUP><A HREF="#ft_5">5</A> </SUP>, federal
and state statutes, and executive branch reports.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_6">6</SUP></A>
Despite the clear articulation of principles that would, if implemented,
preserve individual privacy, individuals continue to experience an erosion
of privacy. In particular, individuals in this country report an escalating
fear that individual privacy is in greater peril each day due to increased
computerization of personal information.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_7">7</SUP></A>
<BR>
<BR>
The use of technology to meet the information needs of government and business
has disempowered individuals. Technology has escalated the collection of
detailed personal information and enabled massive data sharing between entities
for unrelated purposes -- all without the individual's consent. Today, privacy
protection frequently takes the form of an eight page disclaimer waiving
any claim to privacy which the individual must sign prior to receiving a
service or benefit. The perception of technology as an invasive tool of
&quot;big brother&quot; and &quot;big government&quot; has led civil libertarians
and average citizens to consistently demand legal protection -- be it judicial
or legislative -- from the incursions on privacy and liberty made possible
by the uncontrolled use of technology.<BR>
<BR>
Even where there has been an attempt to codify fair information practices
through statute, regulations, or industry guidelines, the results have generally
fallen far short of the desired goal -- to have individuals control the
collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. This is not to
underestimate the importance of hard fought battles to craft statutory privacy
protections for personal information. Existing privacy laws in areas such
as banking, cable, credit, educational and video records set important limits
on the use and disclosure of personal information. However, there is not
a statute on the books that gives the individual simple, meaningful, up-front,
control over personal information. The sector by sector approach of existing
U.S. law makes analytic sense, but progress has been slow and many gaps
remain.<BR>
<BR>
As a result of this dynamic, efforts to preserve information privacy can
be characterized as a constant struggle to set limits on the invasions of
privacy -- the misuse, unauthorized collection, and unauthorized disclosure
of personal information -- made possible and practical through technology.
<A NAME="sec_1c"></A>
<H3>C. New challenges to privacy</H3>
Once divulged, bits of personal information can reveal what we think, believe,
and feel. No other medium generates personal information with the granularity
of the Internet. Information is generated and captured each time an individual
enters a Web site, views a picture, FTP's a file, or sends an email. Information
is needed to complete each transaction; however, this information, disclosed
over a period of time, in a variety of circumstances, can reveal details
of the individual's habits, beliefs, and affiliations. The individual &quot;womb
to tomb dossiers&quot; of personal information Arthur Miller warned us of
30 years ago may be readily available -- not stored in a central database,
but culled from a variety of sources and pulled together instantaneously
to create a detailed profile of nearly anyone on the Internet.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_8">8</SUP></A>
<BR>
<BR>
Currently few people are aware of the vast amount of information generated
and captured -- and potentially used and disclosed -- during the use of
interactive communications media. Unlike the traditional paper-based world
where the individual is typically aware that they are providing an entity
with information (they present a credit card, or receive a billing statement
from the phone company) much of the information gathering on the Internet
occurs during browsing or other relatively passive activities. Individuals
visit Web sites, read articles, and examine pictures under the illusion
that their activities are anonymous or at least unobserved. <BR>
<BR>
In an effort to increase public demand for privacy protection, last week
CDT launched a privacy demonstration Web site which greets each visitor
with detailed personal information including their name, email address,
computer and browser type and the universal resource locator (URL) indicating
the Web site from which they came. Initial visitors expressed alarm at the
detailed personal information that is routinely recorded by Web sites, Internet
providers, and online commercial service providers. In addition, CDT has
established an online clearinghouse to highlight existing privacy policies
of commercial online service providers. Over the next year, we will expand
the clearinghouse to include information on the information practices of
Internet service providers, content providers and browsers. Through education
we hope to create public demand for stronger more ubiquitous privacy policies
and applications.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_9">9</SUP></A><BR>
<BR>
Interactive media offers new challenges to privacy. There is growing public
concern that the non-consensual, surreptitious collection of personal information
is undermining individual privacy.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_10">10</SUP></A> The
lack of transparency about information collection and use on the Internet
builds upon this concern. Without the knowledge that information is being
collected and used, individuals are unable to make informed decisions to
preserve their privacy. People are uncomfortable when they learn that software
is available and in use that allows Web site operators and other content
providers to easily record their online activities unbeknownst to them.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_11">11</SUP></A>
<BR>
<BR>
As news stories expose the privacy risks of new services and applications
such as Deja News<SUP><A HREF="#ft_12">12</SUP></A>, and cookies<SUP><A HREF="#ft_13">13</SUP></A>,
individuals may become more reticent in their use of the Internet. The lack
of accurate information about the collection, use and disclosure practices
of entities on the Internet, may chill speech and political activity on
the Internet. Individuals may hesitate and pull back from participating
in desirable activities such as signing online petitions to Congress.<A HREF="#ft_14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
They may withdraw from participating in online discussions or visiting Web
sites that contain information on sensitive topics such as sex and health.
<BR>
<BR>
Policy makers around the world our beginning to address the privacy concerns
that threaten to undermine individuals' willingness to partake in First
Amendment and commercial activities on the Internet. While few concrete
solutions have been proposed, privacy's pivotal role in promoting speech
and other democratic values has been recognized. Despite general agreement
that individual privacy must be preserved -- and even enhanced -- in cyberspace,
we are just beginning to explore the means to make privacy work in this
new media.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_15">15</SUP></A> <A NAME="sec_2"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="75%"></CENTER>
<H2>II. The Empowered User: Implementing Privacy Policy in the Digital Age</H2>
Interactive communications media offer both risks and opportunities to securing
individuals' privacy. To have privacy in the Digital Age one must be able
to both enjoy solitude and to make decisions about what, if any, personal
information to divulge, to whom and for what purpose. In the Digital Age
technology can be harnessed to advance privacy by empowering individuals
to control the flow of information on a case by case, setting by setting
basis, by expressing his or her privacy desire. Through the implementation
of existing laws, continued pressure to develop additional laws to protect
personal information in various sectors, and the implementation of individual
empowerment solutions that give people the ability to control personal information
through full notice and meaningful consent, the Internet can be shaped to
support individual privacy. <BR>
From the Luddite movement of the early Nineteenth century through publication
of David Burnham's <EM>Rise of the Computer State</EM>, technology has rightfully
been viewed as a tool by which the interests of the individual are subsumed
to the more powerful interests of the government and big business. While
privacy advocates must continue to push for laws, the ability to empower
people to directly express privacy choices through user controlled technologies
has the potential to significantly alter the traditional relationship between
individuals and technology. <BR>
<BR>
We must seize the opportunity to move beyond the current debate over the
intrusive nature of technology and seize the opportunity to ensure that
privacy protection is a core element of this new communications media.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_16">16</SUP></A>
By building privacy in at the front-end we can craft an environment where
each individual gets to decide the level at which information is protected
instead of relying on the government and the private sector to mete out
weak protections on a sector by sector basis leaving large quantities of
personal information unprotected and vulnerable.<BR>
<BR>
The privacy potential of interactive communications media will be realized
only through the concerted efforts of policy makers, the public interest
community and the communications and computer industries. CDT is exploring
the creation of a PICS-like process for privacy with the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (MIT), the World Wide Web Consortium, public interest organizations,
and Internet content and service providers. If embraced and implemented,
we believe that technology tools, coupled with fair information practices
can provide an effective method of making individual privacy a reality on
the Internet. Individual empowerment technologies which facilitate both
the communication of Web site operator's information practices to users,
and the communication of individuals' privacy preferences to Web site operators,
will give users maximum control over personal information. <A NAME="sec_2a"></A>
<H3>A. Individual Empowerment Solutions Support Core Privacy Principles
</H3>
Individual empowerment solutions support core individual privacy and First
Amendment principles and offer an effective method of ensuring respect for
individual privacy in a medium populated by a diversity of players. While
existing laws that protect personal information in particular sectors must
apply regardless of the medium, much of the information generated online,
and many of the Internet service and content providers who collect and use
information, are not covered by existing statutes. <BR>
<BR>
Due to the extent and detailed nature of personal information that can be
generated, collected and used during online activities, it is essential
that individuals be able to control the flow of this information. Through
the implementation of core privacy principles through policies and technologies
that empower the individual to independently control the flow of personal
information, we can give individuals a meaningful tool with which to fill
existing gaps in both law and practice. <A NAME="sec_2a_1"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>1. Advancing Individual Control</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
CDT believes that people should be provided meaningful notice of information
practices, and the tools to control the use and disclosure of personal information.
Privacy is valued differently by each person. Similarly, an individual's
desire for privacy may vary in different situations. Decisions about the
collection, use and disclosure of personal information have a profound impact
on an individual's ability to exercise First Amendment protected activities.
The individualized nature of privacy and the impact that privacy decisions
may have on other rights and activities, support an approach that vests
control in the individual. Individual empowerment solutions can provide
individuals with the information and tools to make decisions with independence
and flexibility.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_17">17</SUP></A> <BR>
<BR>
Through individual empowerment solutions we can advance individual control
over personal information by: 
<UL>
<LI>enabling individuals, and parents, to exercise control over the collection,
use and disclosure of their or their children's personal information through
a set of individually chose preferences; 
<LI>developing a common language to assist Web site operators in notifying
users of their information practices in a standard, easily understood format;
<LI>enabling third parties to provide additional information to users regarding
the information practices of information providers. <A NAME="sec_2a_2"></A>
</UL>
<STRONG>2. Maximizing the Democratic Potential of the Internet</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Individual empowerment solutions use the Internet's unique features to advance
privacy. Individual empowerment solutions build upon the medium's interactivity.
The two-way communication supported by interactive media make the exchange
of information about privacy preferences and practices simple, inexpensive,
and in many instances seamless. The diversity of players on the Internet
-- from the individual with a personal Web site, to the many political Web
sites, to large corporations, require that if we are to develop a uniform
approach to privacy -- which we believe we should -- it must be a solution
that addresses the privacy needs of individuals in each interaction. Shaping
the architecture of the Internet to support individual control over personal
information offers an effective method of preserving privacy in this context.
<BR>
<BR>
Similar to the characteristics of the medium itself, the social and political
nature of Internet users is distinct in ways that may be important to privacy
considerations. First, even in its nascent stage, the Internet has shown
itself to be responsive to those who populate it.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_18">18</SUP></A>
Second, many pioneers of the electronic frontier are self-described libertarians.
Third, the Internet is alive with people engaged in a host of activities
that many consider sensitive.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_19">19</SUP></A> Both the
people engaged in these activities and those establishing the areas where
they take place, have a strong interest in developing an environment that
engenders trust and confidence in its users. This may bode well for privacy.
The combination of a medium that has been responsive to its users, early
users who are known privacy fundamentalists, and a tradition of people engaging
in activities that they want to keep private, may prove a hopeful combination
for individual privacy. <A NAME="sec_3"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="75%"></CENTER>
<H2>III. Technologies of Privacy</H2>
We believe that technologies must be designed to give people control over
personal information by allowing users to avoid Web sites with inappropriate
information collection and use practices, and allowing them to set privacy
preferences that prevent or limit the collection, use and disclosure of
personal information. Building upon the success of the Platform for Internet
Content Selections (PICS) -- a values-neutral platform that enables parents
to exercise control over children's access to inappropriate material --
and other user empowering technologies, CDT believes that we can develop
applications that maximize individual control over information. In the past
ten months, the PICS platform has evolved from concept to final release
of standards. Over the next few months, every major browser and online service
will update products to include the programming necessary to read and interpret
PICS labels. At least four different content labeling and rating services
will be available to the public. And there will be two Web-based bureaus
where content owners can create their own descriptive labels. In the very
near future, PICS will be widely available on the Internet.<A NAME="sec_3a"></A>
<H3>A. Privacy Preferences: Enable Individuals to Control the Flow of Personal
Information </H3>
Technologies that allow users to communicate privacy preferences to Web
sites can promote individual control over the extent and nature of personal
information, if any, that flows to each Web site and its subsequent use
and disclosure. In the normal course of an interaction between a Web site
and a user much information is exchanged in both directions. The user receives
whatever content the Web site has to display. The Web site often maintains
logs of personal transactional information on each visitor. <BR>
<BR>
By allowing the individual or parent to configure their own privacy preferences
that are communicated by their browser to each Web site they visit, individual
empowerment solutions enable individuals to view material on a Web site
while maintaining control over personal information. Technology can be used
to communicate limits on the use and disclosure of personal information
revealed<SUP><A HREF="#ft_20">20</SUP></A>, or block the collection of personal
information altogether.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_21">21</SUP></A> <BR>
<BR>
The following three scenarios play out possible interactions between a Web
site equipped with this enhanced PICS application and a user who has configured
privacy preferences. <A HREF="#scen_3a_1">Scenario 1</A> describes the interaction
between a Web site with a policy of accepting all visitors and complying
with all limits they have set on the collection, use and disclosure of personal
information. Scenarios 2 and 3 describe the interaction between the individual
and a Web site with specific information practices. In <A HREF="#scen_3a_2">Scenario
2 </A>the individual's privacy preferences and the Web site's information
practices match. In <A HREF="#scen_3a_3">Scenario 3</A> the individual's
privacy preferences and the Web site's information practices are incompatible.
<A NAME="scen_3a_1"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Scenario 1: <BR>
The Web Site that pleases all users<BR>
</STRONG><BR>
A Web site operator has made the decision to maximize the number of individuals
who visit their site. Using capabilities built into his server software
that carry individuals' privacy preferences along with their personal information,
the Web site operator has configured his site to accept individuals with
all privacy preferences. 
<DL>
<DT>Step 1 
<DD>Using a standard format to describe information preferences, the individual
sets her privacy preferences, indicating how she wants personal information
handled. <BR>
<BR>
<DT>Step 2 
<DD>The Web site operator configures his server software to accept individuals
with various privacy preferences. (For example preferences such as: do not
collect information; or, do not use for unrelated purposes.)<BR>
<BR>
<DT>Step 3 
<DD>Once her privacy preferences are set, the individual browses the Internet.
The browser will automatically communicate her preferences to the site which
will then record the appropriate restrictions on the collection, use, and
disclosure of her personal information. <BR>
<BR>
<DT>Step 4 
<DD>Notice and choice about information practices in this instance occurs
transparently, providing users of the Internet the seamless flow of information
they expect. The Web site has decided to conduct business regardless of
the individually established limits on the use of personal information.
<A NAME="scen_3a_2"></A>
</DL>
<STRONG>Scenario 2:<BR>
The Perfect Match: Individual's privacy preferences and Web site's practices
match.</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Using a standard format a Web site operator provides notice of their information
practices which is read by the individual's browser and compared with the
individual's privacy preference. They are compatible so the person enters
the Web site without further dialogue. 
<DL>
<DT>Step 1 
<DD>The individual sets her privacy preferences, indicating how she wants
personal information handled. <BR>
<BR>
<DT>Step 2 
<DD>The Web site operator develops a notice accurately describing the site's
information practices. (For example, notice would include information about
collection, use, disclosure, access, correction, and retention and other
factors.)<BR>
<BR>
<DT>Step 3 
<DD>Once her privacy preferences are set, the individual browses the Internet.
The browser will automatically compare her preferences with the notice of
information practice provided by sites. <BR>
<BR>
<DT>Step 4 
<DD>When the user enters the URL for a Web site, the browser will automatically
compare the individual's preferences with the individual's configured preferences.
Where the individual's preferences and site's notice of information practices
match (or if site's practices are more privacy protective) she will enter
the site directly. <BR>
<BR>
<DT>Step 5 
<DD>Notice and choice about information practices in this instance occurs
transparently, providing users of the Internet the seamless flow of information
they expect on the Internet. <A NAME="scen_3a_3"></A>
</DL>
<STRONG>Scenario 3:<BR>
A Mis-match of Preference and Practice: Individual's preferences and Web
site's practices differ.</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
As in scenario 2, a Web site operator has provided a notice of information
practice in a standard format and the individual has a browser which is
capable of, and configured to, read and compare the notice with the individual's
privacy preference. In this instance the individual's preference and Web
site's practices are incompatible. 
<DL>
<DT>Step 1 
<DD>The individual sets her privacy preferences (or sets preferences for
their children), indicating how she wants personal information handled.<BR>
<BR>
<DT>Step 2 
<DD>The Web site operator develops a notice accurately describing the site's
information practices. (For example, notice would include information about
collection, use, disclosure, access, correction, and retention and other
factors.)<BR>
<BR>
<DT>Step 3 
<DD>Once her privacy preferences are set, the individual browses the Internet.
The browser will automatically compare her preferences with the notice of
information practice provided by sites. (Does this require a common description
of information practices?)<BR>
<BR>
<DT>Step 4 
<DD>When the user enters the URL for a Web site, the browser will automatically
compare the individual's preferences with the individual's configured preferences.
<BR>
<BR>
<DT>Step 5 
<DD>In this case, the Web site's practices do not match the individual's
privacy preferences. The browser will notify the individual of the mis-match
in one of two ways: <BR>
1) the Web site may choose to respond -- a window would appear informing
the individual of the mis-match and allowing the individual to choose to
view the information practices, directly enter the site, or leave; or,<BR>
2) the Web site may choose not to respond (or if they have no information
practice notice they will have nothing to respond with), in which case once
notified of the mis-match the individual can choose whether to enter the
site.<A NAME="sec_3b"></A> 
</DL>
<H3>B. Block Bad Actors: Limit Access to Sites With Abusive Information
Collection Practices</H3>
Existing PICS technology can enable individuals to block access to World
Wide Web sites which engage in unfair information collection procedures
(defined by either the individual or an organization).<SUP><A HREF="#ft_22">22</SUP></A>
The PICS approach is flexible enough that an individual can prevent access
to pages that contain information collection forms, without prohibiting
access to the entire Web site. Today, consumer groups, privacy organizations,
or industry self-regulatory bodies can easily create PICS rating systems
which would be used to block access to Web pages based on the strength or
lack of privacy practices.<BR>
<BR>
The following two scenarios play out the privacy applications possible with
current PICS technology. In Scenario 1 a third-party has developed a list
of &quot;good actors&quot; (based on any subjective criteria) which is used
by an individual to control her access to the Web. In Scenario 2 a third-party
has developed a list of &quot;good actors&quot; which a mother is using
to direct her child's access to Web sites. <A NAME="scen_3b_1"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Scenario 1: <BR>
The Pro-privacy list: Individual only wants to visit &quot;good&quot; actors<BR>
</STRONG><BR>
Consumer only wants to visit sites that Privacy First has placed on its
index of pro-privacy Web sites. 
<DL>
<DT>Step 1 
<DD>Using her PICS-compatible web browser an individual would set her browser
to only allow access to Web sites that are on Privacy First's pro-privacy
list (held on a server somewhere). 
<DT>Step 2 
<DD>When she enters a URL, her browser will compare the entry with the list
compiled by Privacy First. <BR>
<BR>
<DT>Step 3 
<DD>If the site is on the pro-privacy list the connection will be made seamlessly.<BR>
<BR>
<DT>Step 4 
<DD>If the site is not on the pro-privacy list the connection will be blocked.
The user can choose to override her preference and enter anyway, or can
choose not to enter the site. <A NAME="scen_3b_2"></A>
</DL>
<STRONG>Scenario 2: <BR>
The Protective Parent: Parent limits child's access to &quot;good&quot;
actors<BR>
</STRONG><BR>
Parent only wants child to visit Internet sites that are on Privacy First's
&quot;child list&quot; of Web sites that don't solicit personal information.<BR>
<BR>
Here we have a parent who is concerned about her son's activities on the
Internet. In particular, she is concerned that her son may be revealing
his name, and email and street addresses to others. She is interested in
limiting her son's access to pages of Web sites that contain information
collection forms. 
<DL>
<DT>Step 1 
<DD>Using her PICS-compatible web browser an individual would set her browser
to only allow her son access to Web sites that are on Privacy First's &quot;child
list.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<DT>Step 2 
<DD>When her eight year old son enters a URL, the browser will compare the
entry with the list compiled by Privacy First. <BR>
<BR>
<DT>Step 3 
<DD>If the site is on the &quot;child list&quot; the connection will be
made seamlessly.<BR>
<BR>
<DT>Step 4 
<DD>If the site is not on the &quot;child list&quot; the connection will
be blocked. Her son will be notified that the site is blocked and he can
request his mom's permission to enter. 
</DL>
The scenarios above represent the potential for the Internet to develop
and flourish as a medium that allows the strongest expression of personal
privacy. The individual is able to decide in an informal manner, at the
front-end, without coercion, what if any information to divulge and for
what purpose it may be used. We have an opportunity to truly empower individuals
to take charge and control the flow of personal information by developing
and implementing technologies that vest simple methods for exercise meaningful
control over personal information in the individual. If our goal is to fully
implement the core privacy principle -- individual's have the right to control
the collection, use and disclosure of their personal information -- on the
Internet, policies that build upon the innate ability of interactive communications
media to support individual control hold great promise. <BR>
<BR>
Clearly individual empowerment solutions are meaningless unless they are
effective. Enforcement is a crucial part of any privacy solution. We believe
the FTC has an effective method of enforcing privacy policy on the Internet.
Once an entity has put forth a privacy policy or agreed to adhere to an
individual's preferences, any deviation or breach of the terms set out would
be actionable as a deceptive and unfair practice. We believe the FTC has
full jurisdiction to ensure that entities operate fairly on the Internet
and conform to their stated information practice policies. <A NAME="sec_4"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="75%"></CENTER>
<H2>IV. Protecting Children's Privacy Online</H2>
The issue of children's information privacy on the Internet has caught the
public's eye. Children are an increasingly large segment of the Internet
user population. The Internet offers children, like adults, a tremendous
opportunity to exchange ideas and participate in a world outside their window.
However, the ease with which children can access ideas, reveal information
about themselves, and participate in a range of activities without parental
supervision, has and will continue to be a subject of concern. <BR>
<BR>
CDT is dedicated to enhancing children's privacy on the Internet. We believe
that individual empowerment solutions coupled with fair information practices
and policies, parental involvement, and strong government response to deceptive
and unfair information collection practices, can best protect children's
privacy. <A NAME="sec_4a"></A>
<H3>A. Empowering Parents</H3>
The Internet is currently being designed to support parental empowerment
solutions which can be implemented without curtailing the availability of
information, nor limiting the speech and associational rights of other Internet
users. Through user control technology parents can: 
<UL>
<LI>prevent their child from accessing Web sites with inappropriate information
practices -- as defined by the parent or a consumer or privacy organization
of the parent's choice; 
<LI>prevent their child from revealing personal information such as name,
address, and email address to others; 
<LI>allow their child to access sites but limit the collection, use and/or
disclosure of their child's personal information; 
<LI>exercise control over their child's personal information without directly
supervising their Internet activities; 
<LI>install security measures such as passwords that prevent their child
from changing rules established by the parent regarding Web site access
or information disclosure, collection and use. 
</UL>
CDT believes that parental empowerment technologies provide a solution that
gives parent's real control over information. Technologies that allow minors
or parents to exercise control over the collection, use and disclosure of
children's personal information both affirm minors' independent interest
in making decisions regarding personal information, and provide the flexibility
to accommodate different parental judgments and preferences regarding childrearing
and privacy. By allowing parents to decide the age at which, or situations
in which, a minor is mature enough to independently exercise control over
personal information, and those in which the parent will decide in their
stead, user controlled technologies support minors' independent rights,
facilitate parental involvement, and avoid one-size-fits-all solutions.<A
NAME="sec_4b"></A>
<H3>B. Avoiding rules that may infringe on other rights</H3>
The close nexus between individual privacy and First Amendment freedoms
demands careful inspection of rules designed to protect privacy. Protecting
children's privacy online requires a policy that fosters individual privacy
while facilitating minors and parents to in addressing their particular
privacy and safety concerns. <BR>
<BR>
Individual empowerment technologies avoid a host of thorny constitutional
issues raised by age-based limitations and provide parents with the ability
to exercise control over personal information on behalf of their children.
Alternative proposals for protecting children which turn on age-based rules
to control information use may require entities operating online to verify
the age of each individual with whom they interact. Age verification may
well escalate the collection of personal information and ultimately lead
to the creation of a nation-wide lists of users and their ages which would
directly implicate fundamental rights of freedom of association,<SUP><A HREF="#ft_23">23</SUP></A>
and undermine individual privacy. In addition, implementing identification
requirements on the Web would limit all Internet users ability to read,
speak, receive information<SUP><A HREF="#ft_24">24</SUP></A>, and interact
online under Constitutionally-protected conditions of anonymity.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_25">25</SUP></A>

<H2>V. European Union Data Protection Directive</H2>
In July, 1995, the European Union (EU) adopted the Directive On the Protection
of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the
Free Movement of such Data (known as the &quot;Data Protection Directive&quot;).
In essence, the Directive sets forth rules relating to individual access
to personal data, requires individual consent prior to certain uses of personal
information, calls for &quot;appropriate&quot; security safeguards to be
put in place by companies handling personal information, and requires member
countries to create &quot;supervisory authorities&quot; to oversee implementation
of the Directive. The intent behind the Directive is to harmonize the data
protection laws within the EU, providing European citizens with a minimum
level of data protection. <BR>
<BR>
The Directive's reach stretches far beyond the limits of the European community
by limiting the transfer of data to non-member countries that do not ensure
an &quot;adequate&quot; level of data protection.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_26">26</SUP></A>
Although the contours of the &quot;adequacy&quot; standard are unclear,
it is certain that the Directive has the potential to seriously impede the
flow of data from member states to the United States. <A NAME="sec_5a"></A>
<H3>A. Goals of the Directive</H3>
The goal of the Directive is &quot;to protect the fundamental rights and
freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy, with
respect to the processing of personal data &quot;that is automated or contained
in a &quot;filing system&quot; structured to permit easy access to personal
data. (Articles 1 &amp; 3) Data protection -- referred to in the United
States as information privacy --is considered a fundamental human right
in Europe, which must be preserved as the EU moves to a common, internal
market.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_27">27</SUP></A> To protect privacy, the Directive
establishes a core set of fair information practice principles to apply
to data held by both the public and private sectors. <BR>
<BR>
Consistent with the Fair Information Practice Principles developed by HEW
in 1973, the Directive calls for clear notice, informed consent for data
use, individual access and correction rights, and data reliability and security
. In addition, the Directive calls on Member countries to provide judicial
remedies for failures to comply with the directive and to establish independent
&quot;supervisory authorities&quot;-- with whom all data controllers must
register -- to oversee implementation and enforcement of the Directive.
<BR>
<BR>
The core of the Directive -- as with information privacy policy in general
-- is the consent provision. The Directive requires that all processing
of personal data occur only with the subject's unambiguous consent. Consent
is defined by the Directive as &quot;any freely given specific and informed
indication&quot; of the data subject's wishes, by which he or she &quot;signifies
agreement to personal data relating to him being processed.&quot; (Article
2 (h)) Further, the Directive requires that data subjects be able to object
to data processing for commercial or charitable marketing activity at no
cost. (Article 14b) Buttressing the consent provision is the requirement
that all individuals be given full and accurate information about the data
processing activity.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_28">28</SUP></A> <BR>
<BR>
The Directive sets additional limits on the collection of data. All data
must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes
for which they are processed,&quot; and the purposes must be explicit and
legitimate and determined at the time of collection. The purpose of any
additional processing &quot;shall not be incompatible with the purposes
as they were originally specified.&quot; (Articles 6 &amp; 7) <BR>
<BR>
The Directive carves out particular types of information for heightened
protection. It requires &quot;the data subject's explicit consent&quot;
for the processing of sensitive data (capable by their nature of infringing
fundamental freedoms or privacy, such as data relating to racial or ethnic
origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union
membership, and data relating to health or sex life). In addition, the Directive
allows that some countries may prohibit the processing of data despite the
consent of the subject. (Article 8)<BR>
<BR>
The Directive acknowledges that privacy, like other values, is not absolute
and exists in relation to, and at times in tension with, other important
societal values. The Directive acknowledges circumstances in which personal
data may be processed without consent, such as for &quot; the performance
of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
authority, or in the legitimate interests of a natural or legal person,
provided that the interests or the rights and freedoms of the data subject
are not overriding.&quot; Further, the Directive explicitly recognizes and
provides exceptions to protect important speech and free flow of information
interests. The Directive states that where processing is solely for journalistic,
artistic or literary purposes, exceptions may apply if they are necessary
to reconcile the right to privacy with the rules governing freedom of expression.
(Article 9)<BR>
<BR>
Most important for U.S. policy, the Directive prohibits the transfer of
personal data to non-Member countries that do not have &quot;adequate levels
of protection.&quot; The Directive provides that the adequacy of a non-member
country's protection &quot;must be assessed in light of all the circumstances
surrounding the transfer operation. Particular consideration shall be given
to the nature of the data... and the rules of law, both general and sectional,
in force, and the professional rules and security measures which are complied
with in that country.&quot; (Article 25) Further, even where a non-member
country's protection is deemed inadequate, the transfer of data may still
be acceptable if the data subject has consented, or the transfer is necessary
in relation to a contract, the protection of an important public interest,
or where the &quot;controller&quot; of the data offers &quot;appropriate
safeguards.&quot; (Article 26) <A NAME="sec_5b"></A>
<H3>B. U.S. Privacy Policy, the Internet, and the EU Directive</H3>
The EU Directive has been an external force subtlety driving U.S. policy
makers and industry to examine privacy issues. As its implementation looms
near, industry, privacy advocates, and policy makers alike are attempting
to discern how the Internet should meet the &quot;adequacy&quot; standard.
<BR>
<BR>
CDT believes that individual empowerment solutions, along with a continued
emphasis on strengthening existing statutes, crafting new laws to protect
information on a sector by sector basis, strong enforcement, and prosecution
of unfair and deceptive information practices, will advance individual privacy
on the Internet -- consistent with the core goals of the EU Directive. <BR>
<BR>
The implementation of individual empowerment technologies that allow individuals
to exercise control over information in a simple, effective manner are a
means of implementing the core notice and consent requirements of the EU
Directive. Through the development of a standard format for expressing information
practices and a method for exchanging individual privacy preferences and
entities information practices, individual empowerment solutions would assist
entities operating on the Internet to meet the notice and consent provisions
of the EU Directive in a nearly seamless fashion.<BR>
<BR>
There are a number of factors that should guide attempts to apply the EU
Directive to the Internet. First, the global, decentralized nature of the
Internet does not easily lend itself to regional regulation. Second, unlike
the sectoral approach taken by U.S. policy makers, the EU Directive -- especially
when applied to the Internet -- casts a wide net over a very disparate cast
of content providers, including the operators of hundreds of thousands of
Web sites. Third, the Internet has shown itself to be particularly suited
to supporting First Amendment activities and careful attention should be
paid not to unintentionally interfere with its ability to support robust
speech.<BR>
<BR>
In considering the Directive's application we should be particularly careful
of its impact on other core values. For example, the requirement that each
data controller register with the &quot;supervisory authority&quot; appears
at first to be a useful accountability provision. However, in practice,
requiring every individual with a Web site to register with a government
authority may have a chilling effect on individual speech and communication.
The application of similarly well-intentioned regulations have been found
infirm where they may impact on protected First Amendment rights.<SUP><A HREF="#ft_29">29</SUP></A>
<BR>
<BR>
While the impact of applying the entire EU Directive to the Internet raises
some concerns, meeting the notice and consent provisions of the EU directive
is a goal that is attainable, and one that would advance individual privacy
and the democratic potential of the Internet. Currently very few entities
operating on the Internet provide individuals with notice of their information
practices. Similarly, the consent requirement set out in the Directive,
while codified in certain sectors, is not a standard on which the Internet
currently operates. The development of statutory protections to fill the
many holes in U.S. privacy law is unlikely, and it is clear that current
practice on the Internet does not meet the Directive's adequacy standard.
<BR>
<BR>
While there are a host of additional factors that will be examined in determining
adequacy, we believe that assisting individuals to exercise meaningful,
front-end control over the collection, use and disclosure of personal information
will bring the Internet in line with the Directive's core mission of advancing
individual privacy and support individuals' continued ability to speak and
receive information on the Internet. <A NAME="conclusion"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="75%"></CENTER>
<H2>VI. Conclusion</H2>
In the Digital Age, technology can be the individual's ally, not the intrusive,
meglomaniacal villain, it has been in so many other settings. Through technological
mechanisms that put individuals in control of their information by providing
them with notice of companies information practices and real opportunities
to clearly express the method in which they want their information handled,
the Internet can offer individuals the capacity to protect their privacy
while preserving core First Amendment values. <BR>
<BR>
The potential to meet the goals of protecting privacy and speech, and increase
child safety through a solution that maximizes individual and parental control
should be attractive to privacy advocates, First Amendment advocates and
child advocates alike. We have the opportunity to reverse the pattern of
using technology to undermine individual privacy. Ensuring that the architecture
of the Global Information Infrastructure is designed to support individual
empowerment solutions will have a profound effect on individual privacy
in the Twenty-first Century. <A NAME="footnotes"></A><BR>

5 While there is no definitive case finding a constitutional right of information
privacy, the Supreme Court acknowledged that such a privacy right exists
in Whalen v. Roe.429 U.S. 589 (1977) (upholding a state statute that required
doctors to disclose information on individuals taking certain highly addictive
prescription drugs for inclusion on a state database) &quot;This information
is made available only to a small number of public health officials with
a legitimate interest in the information. [Broad] dissemination by state
officials of such information, however, would clearly implicate constitutionally
protected privacy rights. . . Id. at 606.<BR>
<BR>
However, the &quot;reasonable expectation&quot; standard set out in U.S..
v. Katz , initially hailed as the landmark privacy decision, has consistently
been used to permit the use of technology to undermine privacy interests.
As technology has advanced, and as societal demands for sensitive personal
information have increased, the Court has increasingly circumscribed the
&quot;zones&quot; one may justifiably consider private. Subsequent decisions
have consistently allowed the circumstances of modern existence to define
the &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy.&quot; If an intrusion is technically
possible, one's expectation of privacy in certain activities is unreasonable.<A
NAME="ft_6"></A><BR>
<BR>
6 The lack of strong constitutional privacy protection has placed added
emphasis on federal and state statutory protections. While statutory privacy
protections for personal information have been crafted on a sector by sector
basis, many are based on a common set of principles -- The Code of Fair
Information Principles . Developed by the Department of Health Education
and Welfare in 1973 printed in the Report of the Secretary's Advisory Committee
on Automated Personal Data Systems, Records, Computers and the Rights of
Citizens, U.S. Dept. of Health, Education &amp; Welfare, July 1973.<A NAME=

the capacity to at the stroke of a key pull together an indivdiuals words
scattered between 1979 and 1996 in potentially thousands of different usenet
groups provides a glimpse of the type of profiling that is made inexpensive
and practical in this media. <A NAME="ft_9"></A><BR>

<BR>
15 In addition to the Federal Trade Commission's ongoing efforts, The National
Information Infrastructure Advisory Council issued its &quot;Privacy and
Security-Related Principles&quot; last year, followed by the Inter-agency
Information Infrastructure Task Force's Privacy Principles. More recently,
the Department of Commerce's NTIA released its report on &quot;Privacy and
Telecommunications-Related Data,&quot; which concluded that the private
sector must implement privacy standards or face a legislative mandate. In
addition, Rep. Bob Franks (R-NJ) recently introduced the &quot;Children's
Privacy Protection and Parental Empowerment Act,&quot; to protect children's
privacy.<A NAME="ft_16"></A><BR>
<BR>
16 As the recent Department of Commerce report, &quot;Privacy and the NII:
Safeguarding Telecommunications-Related Personal Information,&quot; concluded:
&quot;The promised interactivity of the NII may diminish the need to make
a policy choice between opt-in and opt-out. Such interactivity would make
it possible for service providers to obtain consent to use transaction-related
personal information] from subscribers electronically before any services
were rendered.&quot; October, 1995 report, p.26.<A NAME="ft_17"></A><BR>
<BR>
17 Of course there are instances where the individual's ability to make
decisions regarding the flow of personal information may be encumbered.
For example, where the government seeks access to personal information on
an individual held by a third-party the individual's ability to intervene
and exercise control may demand that they receive notice of the request
for access. Similarly, in the context of medical treatment, providing individuals
with the ability to exercise meaningful control over the flow of personal
may require procedures that protect the individual during this moment of
vulnerability from rapacious information demands. These settings should
be addressed with solutions that assist individuals, or those acting in
their stead, to control personal information.<A NAME="ft_18"></A><BR>
<BR>
18 Internet users have sent powerful responses to those who have &quot;abused&quot;
the Net. Mass emailings typically result in spamming -- tons of angry messages
deluging the original sender. Deja News quickly added a mechanism to allow
users to flag postings that they did not want archived. Similarly, most
&quot;look-up&quot; services on the Net give individuals the opportunity
to opt-out via the Net.<A NAME="ft_19"></A><BR>
<BR>
19 Support groups on topics ranging from sexual abuse to drug addiction,
discussions on political topics from anarchy to Cuba to Newt Gingrich, and
pictures and stories of sexual and other fantasies abound on the Internet.<A
NAME="ft_20"></A><BR>
<BR>
20 After several press stories about DejaNews, a service that organizes
all usenet postings into a searchable index by author's name, the company
stated that they were instituting a flag that would allow people to notify
them that they did not want a particular posting to be archived. This is
an example of a limit on subsequent use of information, it is particularly
interesting because many users of the Internet would state that usenet postings
are public and subject to no reasonable privacy expectation.<A NAME="ft_21"></A><BR>
<BR>
21 Community Connexion, an Internet Service Provider, recently debuted the
Anonymizer which allows individuals to surf the Internet without revealing
transactional data to the Web sites they visit.<A NAME="ft_22"></A><BR>
<BR>
22 In addition, software -- similar to products on the market to limit children's
access to objectionable content -- could be developed to limit access to
sites that have unacceptable information practices. <A NAME="ft_23"></A><BR>
<BR>

24 Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U.S. 301 (1965) (invalidating restrictions

<BR>
25 Plaintiffs in ACLU's case challenging the constitutionality of the Communications
Decency Act, including EFF, EPIC, and others, made this point quite eloquently.
In addition, parental empowerment approach allows children, like all Internet
users, to remain relatively anonymous during transactions and interactions
on the Internet. This anonymity may help protect them from people who would
single children out for harm.<A NAME="ft_26"></A><BR>
<BR>
26 The Directive has been five years in the making, the first draft circulated
in the fall, 1990. Earlier drafts of the Directive required non-Member countries
to have &quot;equivalent&quot; levels of data protection before personal
data could flow from Member countries. An &quot;equivalency&quot; test was
considered to be too stringent by many in the private sector. A debate within
the EU continues as to how &quot;adequacy&quot; will be measured, and whether,
in application, an adequacy test will be lass rigorous than an equivalency
standard.<A NAME="ft_27"></A><BR>
<BR>
27 As the Directive states in its preamble: &quot; Whereas data processing
systems are designed to serve man; whereas they must, whatever the nationality
or residence of natural persons, respect their fundamental rights and freedoms,
notably the right to privacy, and contribute to economic and social progress,
trade expansion, and the well-being of individuals. The Directive relies,in
part on the 1980 OECD Data Protection Guidelines, as well as the Council
of Europe Convention of 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with Regard
to Automatic Processing of Personal Data.<A NAME="ft_28"></A><BR>
<BR>
28 The Directive requires that data subjects learn of the existence of a
processing operation, where data is collected from the individual, and must
be given full and accurate information about the data processing activity.
<A NAME="ft_29"></A><BR>
<BR>
29 See, NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415 (1963) (holding a provision which
prohibited any organization from retaining a lawyer in connection with litigation
to which it was not a party invalid as applied to the NAACP's activities).

Executive Summary<BR>
<BR>
Overview </H3>
In its first full year of activity, the Center for Democracy and Technology
(CDT) has emerged as a leading voice in the critical public policy debates
affecting the future of free expression and privacy in the Information Age.
Founded in December, 1994, the Center's mission is to develop public policies
that preserve and advance democratic values and constitutional civil liberties
on the Internet and other interactive communications media.<BR>
<BR>
CDT pursues its mission through public policy working groups, public 
interest/industry
coalition building efforts, policy research, litigation, public education,
and grass-roots organizing. CDT relies on a combination of staff expertise
in relevant law and technology, combined with a unique consultation process
that brings together diverse interests from across the political spectrum,
public interest community, and the communications industry to address critical
public policy issues.<BR>
<BR>
CDT is a non-profit 501(c)(3), public interest organization supported by
individuals, foundations, and a broad cross section of the computer and
communications industry. <BR>
<A NAME="agenda"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>
<H3><STRONG>CDT's 1996 Agenda</STRONG></H3>
The Center's 1996 agenda is ambitious, including several new projects. Highlights
include: 
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Constitutional Challenge To Online Indecency Restrictions:</STRONG>
CDT, along with the American Library Association, America Online, People
for the American Way, representatives from CDT's Interactive Working Group
(IWG), and others, filed a lawsuit in mid-February challenging the constitutionality
of the content regulations imposed on interactive communications media in
the recently enacted Telecommunications Reform Act. Filed under an expedited
appeal process, the lawsuit will reach the Supreme Court and is likely to
establish the First Amendment legal doctrine for the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
Because of its critical importance, CDT, together with AOL and ALA, organized
the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition (CIEC) made up of 37 organizations
and users of the Internet to take part in the litigation and educate the
judiciary about the nature of the Internet. The CIEC lawsuit highlights
the distinct nature of interactive media, and argues that the First Amendment
policy regime designed for broadcast mass media, when applied to the Internet,
is unconstitutionally restrictive given the tremendous user control inherent
in interactive communications technologies. CDT is working with Jenner and
Block's Bruce Ennis, lead attorney in the litigation, to develop the constitutional
challenge to the indecency restrictions. CDT is also organizing expert testimony
and technical expertise for the litigation to establish the ready availability
of user control technologies on the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>IWG Projects On User Empowerment And Vicarious Liability:</STRONG>
The Interactive Working Group is working to educate the communications industry,
Congress, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Administration
on the adoption and implementation of PICS (Platform For Internet Content
Selection) and other user control technologies as an alternative to content
regulations. CDT staff serves on the PICS Steering Committee. <BR>
<BR>
The IWG, which includes representatives from both the online services and
content providers, will also serve as a forum to address liability issues
in the context of the debate over intellectual property law.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Developing An Alternative National Cryptography Policy That
Works Globally: </STRONG>The Digital Privacy and Security Working Group
(DPSWG) will develop recommendations for a comprehensive alternative national
cryptography policy. The DPSWG will emphasize the immediate need for the
elimination of cryptography export restrictions, and press for policy and
market solutions that protect free speech and privacy, and ensure network
security and competitiveness in the Global Information Infrastructure. <BR>
<BR>
In the spring of 1996, the DPSWG will mount a high visibility public education
campaign, including open hearings in California and Washington DC, to inform
the public and members of Congress about the pressing need for an alternative
cryptography policy.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Creating A Marketplace For Privacy In Interactive Media: </STRONG>The
Privacy Forum, a consortium of industry representatives and public interest
and consumer advocacy organizations, is working to develop policy options
and workable standards to empower individuals to exert more control over
the disclosure of personal transactional information, and to create a 
&quot;market&quot;
for privacy enhancing applications.<BR>
<BR>
In an effort to promote the development of privacy solutions, CDT will utilize
our popular World Wide Web site to demonstrate the extent of personal transactional
information generated in the course of browsing our site. The demonstration
will also highlight potential mechanisms to enhance individual control over
the collection of personal information. CDT will create an online privacy
resource center to showcase government recommendations and policies, existing
privacy policies in use by online services and content providers, and related
research and scholarship. Through its resource center and demonstration
site, CDT hopes to facilitate a public discussion towards identifying and
developing various models for enhancing privacy and individual choice online.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Encouraging Affordable, Nation Wide, High-Speed Access To The
Internet:</STRONG> CDT will organize the Digital Access Coalition (DAC),
comprised of commerce, education, and library groups, together with small
businesses and high technology industry leaders, to make the case for rapid
ISDN deployment under affordable pricing structures.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Establishing Basic Free Expression And Privacy Rights For The
Global Internet Community:</STRONG> CDT is launching a World Internet Freedom
Project (WIF), to establish awareness for the need for basic free expression
and privacy rights for Internet users around the world. Working with the
Soros Foundation, human rights organizations, online service providers,
and content providers, the WIF will seek workable solutions to the increasingly
aggressive efforts of foreign governments to regulate online communications.

<H3>CDT's Key Accomplishments In 1995</H3>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Advocating a New Policy Framework For The Internet And Interactive
Media Based On First Amendment Principles: </STRONG>In 1995, CDT established
the Interactive Working Group (IWG), an ad hoc coalition of over 85 public
interest organizations and communications companies. Recognizing the unique
nature of the Internet to foster individual control over content and the
free flow of information, the IWG works to develop practical policy options
to government content regulations.<BR>
<BR>
The IWG played a critical role in urging Congress to extend constitutional
First Amendment principles applicable to print media to the Internet, opposing
legislative attempts to impose content regulations on the Internet and commercial
online services (e.g., the Exon/Coats &quot;Communications Decency Act&quot;).
Although indecency restrictions were included in the Telecommunications
Reform Act, CDT and the IWG laid the foundation for mounting a challenge
to the constitutionality of the restrictions. The IWG successfully fought
to limit vicarious liability for online service providers who merely transmit
materials created by their subscribers. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Advancing Communications Privacy And Network Security:</STRONG>
CDT's Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG), a coalition of
over 50 public interest organizations and representatives from the computer
and communications industries, is a leading voice in the effort to develop
a cryptography policy based on core First Amendment and privacy principles,
which ensures network security and competitiveness in the Global Information
Infrastructure. <BR>
<BR>
In a November 1995 letter to Vice President Gore, over 40 DPSWG members
criticized the Clinton Administration's latest cryptography policy proposal.
The DPSWG pledged to undertake a comprehensive fact finding and information
sharing process to develop an alternative cryptography policy that works
globally.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Exploring Policies To Protect The Privacy Of Personal Online
Transactional Information:</STRONG> CDT's Privacy Forum, a consortium of
public interest organizations and leading corporations working to address
information privacy issues, is engaged in a process to develop comprehensive
guidelines to protect the privacy of personal transactional data. <BR>
<BR>
Re-examining Policies Underlying Disclosure of Personal Information from
Public Records: In 1995, CDT's Privacy Forum completed its examination of
the existing policies underlying public records laws, culminating in a full-day
consultation attended by over 50 representatives from First Amendment and
privacy organizations, and information, communications and computer industries.
The increased ability to collect, store and transmit data in digital media
raise new wrinkles for rules governing public records. The consultation
focused on the heightening tension between the private sector's need for
access to public records and the growing privacy concerns over disclosure
of personal information in the interactive, digital, information environment.
A Forum-commissioned &quot;white paper&quot; served as the foundation for
the consultation. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Grass-Roots Organizing And Public Education: </STRONG>CDT is
pioneering the use of the Internet to conduct unique and effective grass-roots
public education campaigns. CDT's online organizing efforts have helped
to establish an informed, active constituency on the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
As part of CDT's yearlong online campaign against the &quot;Communications
Decency Act,&quot; over 115,000 Internet users signed an online petition
in support of Senator Leahy's alternative legislative proposal. CDT organized
a National Day of Protest on December 12, 1995, which generated over 20,000
phone calls, faxes, and email messages to Congress in opposition to the
online 'indecency' regulations. CDT also spearheaded the &quot;Black Thursday
Protest&quot; during which nearly 2000 World Wide Web pages were turned
black to illustrate the far reaching impact of the 'indecency' provisions
for 48 hours after President Clinton signed the Telecommunications Reform
Act into law.<BR>
<BR>
CDT's World Wide Web site was rated among the top 5% of sites on the Web
by Point Survey; &quot;Best of the Web&quot; by 2ask Survey; and received
3 out of 4 stars from NetGuide Magazine. CDT's site is widely recognized
as the leading source for information on public policy issues affecting
civil liberties online. <A NAME="IWG"></A>
</UL>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="75%"></CENTER>
<H3>The Interactive Working Group </H3>
CDT's Interactive Working Group (IWG) is an ad hoc coalition of over 85
public interest organizations and communications companies dedicated to
developing practical policy options that support the free flow of information
on the Internet and other interactive communications media. The IWG seeks
to develop public policy solutions that recognize the unique characteristics
of interactive media, including its global reach, unlimited publishing capacity,
and enhanced user control.<BR>
<BR>
In 1995, the IWG worked to develop a constitutional, practical policy alternatives
to Congressional efforts to impose content regulations on the Internet and
commercial online information services, such as the Exon/Coats Communications
Decency Act. Towards this end, the IWG worked closely with Representatives
Chris Cox (R-CA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Rick White (R-WA), along with Senator
Patrick Leahy (D-VT), to develop and build support for alternative legislation
that would prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from imposing
content regulations on interactive media and remove vicarious liability
for online service providers.<A NAME="IWG_activities"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>
<H3>1996 IWG Activities</H3>
The IWG has an ambitious agenda planned for 1996. Activities include: 
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Constitutional Challenge To Online Indecency Restrictions:</STRONG>
CDT, along with the American Library Association, America Online, People
for the American Way, representatives from CDT's Interactive Working Group
(IWG), and others, filed a lawsuit in mid-February challenging the constitutionality
of the content regulations imposed on interactive communications media in
the recently enacted Telecommunications Reform Act. Filed under an expedited
appeal process, the lawsuit will reach the Supreme Court and is likely to
establish the First Amendment legal doctrine for the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
Because of its critical importance, CDT, together with AOL and ALA, has
organized the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition (CIEC) made up of
37 organizations and users of the Internet to take part in the litigation
and educate the judiciary about the nature of the Internet. The CIEC lawsuit
highlights the distinct nature of interactive media, and argues that the
First Amendment policy regime designed for broadcast mass media, when applied
to the Internet, is unconstitutionally restrictive given the tremendous
user control inherent in interactive communications technologies. <BR>
<BR>
CDT is working with Jenner and Block's Bruce Ennis, lead attorney in the
litigation, to develop the constitutional challenge to the indecency restrictions.
CDT is also organizing expert testimony and technical expertise for the
litigation to establish the ready availability of user control technologies
on the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>IWG Project On User Empowerment:</STRONG> The Interactive Working
Group will work to educate the communications industry, Congress, the FCC,
and the Administration on the adoption and implementation of PICS (Platform
For Internet Content Selection) and other user control technologies as an
alternative to content regulations. CDT believes that blocking, filtering
and rating server standards being developed through the PICS process present
a compelling case that the least restrictive means to protect children from
harmful material is through such parental-controlled blocking, not intrusive,
bureaucratic and unconstitutional government censorship. CDT is on the Steering
Committee of PICS.<BR>
<BR>
The IWG, which includes representatives from both the online service provider
and content provider industries, will also serve as a forum to address liability
issues in the context of the debate over intellectual property law.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Access Provider Liability Policy Development And Research:</STRONG>
Excessive imposition of vicarious liability on Internet access providers
threatens to stifle the free flow of information and is contrary to constitutional
free speech and privacy principles. Yet, in areas such as defamation and
intellectual property rights, the law is evolving toward dangerous imposition
of liability on access providers. Though CDT has no desire to overturn basic
intellectual property protection, or to prevent proper recovery under tort
law, we believe that such imposition of liability threatens the core of
the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
CDT will undertake basic research and exploration of policy alternatives
in order to identify possible policies which provide clear and appropriate
legal frameworks for the operation of access providers. This research will
involve consultation with IWG participants supported by legal and policy
background papers prepared by CDT staff.<A NAME="IWG_accomp"></A>

<H3>1995 IWG Accomplishments:</H3>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Advocating A New Policy Framework For The Internet And Interactive
Media Based On First Amendment Principles:</STRONG> The IWG worked to develop
constitutional, practical policy options to government content regulations
that recognized the unique nature of the Internet to foster individual control
over content and the free flow of information. <BR>
<BR>
The IWG played a critical role in the debate over Congressional attempts
to impose unconstitutional content regulations on the Internet and commercial
online services (e.g., the Exon/Coats &quot;Communications Decency Act&quot;).
In addition to urging Congress to extend constitutional First Amendment
principles applicable to print media onto the Internet, the IWG successfully
fought to limit vicarious liability for online service providers who merely
transmit materials created by their subscribers. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Working Group Report on Technology and Policy Alternatives for
Interactive Media:</STRONG> IWG produced a comprehensive report on the case
for a policy framework for interactive media based on the democratic values
of freedom of speech and the free flow of information, including a overview
on the availability of user control technology, the state of current law,
and the legal and policy issues raised by legislative efforts to impose
content regulations on interactive media. The study was distributed to members
of Congress and the press in July, 1995.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Demonstration of User Empowerment Technologies:</STRONG> IWG
educated public and government officials on the availability of less restrictive
alternatives to government content regulations, including user control technologies.
IWG, working with the Interactive Services Association (ISA), presented
a technological demonstration for members of Congress, their staff, and
the press of user control technologies by America Online, Prodigy, SurfWatch,
Netscape and Webster Network Strategies on July 17, 1995. The demonstration
was instrumental in making the case for the Cox/Wyden approach, and received
considerable press attention nationwide.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Public Education, Grass-Roots Activism in Support of IWG Goals:</STRONG>
CDT undertook a massive Internet based grass-roots public education campaign,
including an online petition drive which yielded over 115,000 signatures
in opposition to government-imposed content regulations and in support of
the Cox/Wyden/White amendment. CDT's online organizing efforts helped draw
public and media attention to the issue. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Publications:</STRONG> CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman and
Deputy Director Daniel Weitzner's article Abundance and User Control: Renewing
the Democratic Heart of the First Amendment in the Age of Interactive Media,
was published in the Yale Law Journal in May, 1995. The article makes the
case for a high level of First Amendment protection for interactive media.

<H3>The Digital Privacy and Security Working Group</H3>
CDT's Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG) is a coalition
of over 50 computer, communications, and public interest organizations working
to develop and implement policies that protect privacy and network security
on the Global Information Infrastructure. <BR>
<BR>
Originally formed in 1986, the DPSWG has played a critical role on several
major privacy issues, including the drafting of the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act (ECPA), the 1994 defeat of the Clinton Administration's Clipper
Chip government key escrow encryption plan, and the crafting of a narrowly
tailored &quot;Digital Telephony&quot; legislation with strong public accountability
mechanisms and privacy protections.<A NAME="DPSWG_projects"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>
<H3>1996 DPSWG Projects: </H3>
In 1996, DPSWG is continuing to play a central role in the increasingly
visible national debate over cryptography policy. DPSWG is also monitoring
the implementation of the &quot;Digital Telephony&quot; legislation (the
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act) and providing a forum
for discussing other issues relating to information privacy and security
on the GII.
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>The DPSWG Cryptography Policy Project:</STRONG> DPSWG is developing
recommendations for an alternative national cryptography policy that will
provide strong privacy and security for users and meets the demands of a
competitive global marketplace. Following through on the commitment made
in its November, 1995 letter to Vice President Gore, DPSWG will hold a series
of forums, and engage in a broad public education campaign about the need
for widely available strong cryptography on the GII. Activities for 1996
include:<BR>
<BR>
  <UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Briefing for the American People:</STRONG> This Spring, the
DPSWG will host a &quot;Briefing for the American People&quot; focusing
on the need for a comprehensive national cryptography policy. This high
visibility event, which will include presentations from industry leaders,
cryptography experts, and public interest advocates, will launch DPSWG's
public education campaign.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>DPSWG Cryptography Summit:</STRONG> This Summer, DPSWG will
bring together leading experts from across industry and the public interest
community for a Cryptography Policy Summit, to exchange ideas on the direction
of cryptography policy and develop a strategy for providing better privacy
and security on the GII.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>White Paper on Encryption Policy:</STRONG> In Fall 1996, DPSWG
will release &quot;A White Paper on Encryption: The Case for a Comprehensive
Cryptography Policy,&quot; summarizing the findings of the DPSWG Summit
and presentations made at the March &quot;Briefing for the American People.&quot;
The &quot;White Paper&quot; will serve as the basis for DPSWG's recommendations
for an alternative cryptography policy.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Legislative Activities:</STRONG> As Congress considers legislation
to address the lack of a comprehensive national cryptography policy, DPSWG
stands ready to play a leading role in the process to ensure that the principles
of free speech and privacy, as well as network security and competitiveness
on the GII, are addressed.<BR>
<BR>
  </UL>
<LI><STRONG>Public Accountability over FBI Electronic Surveillance 
Authority:</STRONG>
The DPSWG is closely monitoring the implementation of the 1994 Communications
Assistance For Law Enforcement Act to ensure that The Act's public accountability
mechanisms are fully utilized and its new privacy protections are strictly
enforced. DPSWG is leading the effort to ensure that the FBI provides historical
justification for its proposed surveillance capacity request, and is working
with Senator Leahy (D-VT) and other concerned members of Congress to ensure
that the public is able to assess the reasonableness of the FBI's request
before funding to implement the requirements is appropriated. <A 
NAME="DPSWG_activities"></A>
</UL>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>
<H3>1995 DPSWG Activities: </H3>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Developing an Alternative National Cryptography Policy:</STRONG>
Throughout 1995, DPSWG worked to mobilize the public interest community
and the computer and communications industry towards developing an alternative
national cryptography policy that satisfies the need for individual privacy
and network security, and will meet the demands of a competitive global
marketplace. <BR>
<BR>
Towards this end, in November 1995, over 40 DPSWG members, companies, trade
associations, and public interest groups wrote to Vice President Gore criticizing
the Administration's current approach to cryptography policy. The coalition
pledged to undertake a process to develop recommendations for a more comprehensive
cryptography policy to be presented to the Administration, Congress, and
the public this year.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Ensuring Public Accountability over FBI Electronic Surveillance
Ability:</STRONG> In 1995, DPSWG also worked to ensure public accountability
over FBI electronic surveillance ability granted under the Communications
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA). Public accountability is essential
in protecting privacy and ensuring reasonable cost recovery. In October,
1995, the FBI announced its first proposed surveillance capacity requirements
notice, as required by CALEA. DPSWG members, in their comments on the FBI's
notice, all stressed the importance of public accountability and disclosure
of the basis for the FBI's request. <A NAME="privacy_forum"></A>
</UL>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="75%"></CENTER>
<H3>The Privacy Forum</H3>
CDT's Privacy Forum is a consortium of public interest organizations and
leading corporations working to identify ways to enhance privacy, individual
choice, and the free flow of information on the global information infrastructure
(GII). The Forum's 1996/1997 mission is to identify existing policies and
explore the development of new policies that encourage technological developments
that advance privacy and facilitate the implementation of basic fair information
practices on the Internet and other interactive communications media. <BR>
<BR>
Through a collaborative process of exploration and discussion, the Forum
will seek to educate its members and the public on the privacy landscape
in interactive media. The Forum will begin by developing a record of existing
policies and technological mechanisms that protect privacy and encourage
individual participation in new communications media. From this factual
basis, the Forum will seek to identify and develop model policies that import
fair information practices applied in other media into the interactive world.
Committed to the principle of extending fair information practices to interactive
media, the Forum intends to explore how to apply traditional fair information
practices in light of the unique characteristics of interactive communications
media.<A NAME="privacy_forum_act"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>
<H3>The Privacy Forum's 1996 Activities: </H3>
The focus of the Privacy Forum's 1996 activities is the privacy of transactional
information generated during users' interactions on the Internet and commercial
online services. A number of online service and content providers have begun
to independently grapple with the privacy ramifications of online activities.
However, transactional privacy has not been a key focus of attention for
the Internet as a whole. As the use of interactive communications technologies
continues to expand, the need for coherent privacy policies and applications
is becoming increasingly clear. <BR>
<BR>
Recognizing that uncertainty about the policies regarding the privacy of
personal information will undermine the public's desire to fully participate
in social, political, and commercial activities online, the Privacy Forum
is working to identify and address key transactional privacy issues. <BR>
<BR>
CDT seeks to advance individual privacy by encouraging the adoption of policies
that enhance the capacity to exercise meaningful choice over the disclosure
and use of personal information, and by collaborating with software developers
and online services and content providers to explore the possibility of
designing and implementing technological mechanisms towards these ends.
Through public education, policy expertise, and informed dialogue, CDT hopes
to facilitate a public discussion towards creating a marketplace for privacy
and individual choice online.<BR>
<BR>
The Forum is establishing a Steering Committee on Transactional Privacy
to guide its work in this endeavor. 
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Creating a Record of Privacy Policies and Promising 
Technologies:</STRONG>
Foremost on the Forum's agenda is the creation of a factual, public record
on transactional information privacy. Before the Forum can develop strategies
for advancing individual privacy and control over personal information,
it must first educate its members and the public as to the existing privacy
policies, the technological capacity of the systems under consideration,
and the strengths, weaknesses, and gaps of each.<BR>
<BR>
  <UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Privacy Policy Clearinghouse:</STRONG> CDT, on behalf of the
Privacy Forum, is soliciting privacy policies from: online service providers;
commercial sites, political sites, non-profit sites and personal sites on
the World Wide Web; Usenet; private and public Internet providers; traditional
telecommunications carriers; and cable companies. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Analysis of State Activities:</STRONG> The Privacy Forum will
work closely with a leading expert in privacy issues and online activities
to review and comment upon activities at the state level, including pending
legislative proposals and regulatory activity. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Analysis of the European Union's Data Protection Directive:</STRONG>
The Forum, in collaboration with a leading privacy expert, will review the
European Union's Data Protection Directive and U.S. privacy laws to examine
the current policies and practices governing the generation, collection,
and use of personal transactional information online. CDT is participating
with Privacy &amp; American Business' Global Privacy Policies Project to
foster the implementation of policies consistent with the recent mandate
of the Directive. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Technology Review:</STRONG> Through a series of technology
demonstrations, the Privacy Forum will create a record of existing technological
mechanisms that encourage user control over the flow of information.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Privacy Forum Compendium on Transactional Privacy:</STRONG>
The Forum will publish the product of its public education efforts in a
compendium on transactional privacy. The review will be made available in
both paper form and electronically via CDT's World Wide Web Privacy Demonstration
Site. 
  </UL>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Developing Models for Fair Information Practices in the Online
Environment:</STRONG> Through an intensive and inclusive process of investigation
and discussion, the Forum seeks to identify and develop model policies and
technological mechanisms that translate fair information practices for the
online world. The Forum will use its Compendium on Transactional Privacy
as the starting point. A series of public consultations, policy briefings,
technology demonstrations and one-on-one meetings between CDT staff and
Forum members will inform the Forum's process. The proceedings of all Forum
activities will be summarized, annotated, and made publicly available as
a single volume.<BR>
<BR>
  <UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Consultations:</STRONG> The Privacy Forum will hold three
consultations in 1996 and 1997 on transactional privacy. Consultations will
be open to the public and effort will be made to attract a wide cross section
of the public interest community, online service providers, software developers,
and individuals who maintain sites on the World Wide Web. <BR>
<BR>
    <UL>
    <LI><STRONG>First Consultation:</STRONG> At its first consultation,
to be held in April, 1996, the Forum will present the product of its search
for existing privacy policies in interactive communications media. The Consultation
will be the focus of a productive, factually based discussion of existing
policies. The goals of the Consultation will be to compare and contrast
existing policies, where possible to identify &quot;best policies,&quot;
to create a record of significant gaps in approaches and policies, and to
discuss the strengths and weaknesses of existing policies.<BR>
<BR>
    <LI><STRONG>Second Consultation:</STRONG> The Forum's second consultation
will highlight policies that advance individual privacy, choice and the
free flow of information through technological mechanisms that take advantage
of the unique characteristics of interactive media. Building upon the &quot;best
policies&quot; identified during the first consultation, the Forum will
seek to establish Fair Information Models for use in the online environment.
Two White Papers, one prepared by CDT in collaboration with the Institute
for Public Representation, and another by the Interactive Services Association
presenting models for enhancing privacy and choice online, will serve as
additional background for the consultation.<BR>
<BR>
    <LI><STRONG>Third Consultation:</STRONG> The third consultation will
focus on implementation issues surrounding fair information practices and
privacy policies. The growing number of intermediaries and the distributed
nature of interactive communications media, raises new wrinkles for applying
fair information and privacy policies. For example, it is unclear who is
responsible for notifying a user of policies, how agreements are passed
on to those involved in a transaction, and who is responsible for breaches
of policy. The third consultation will seek to identify and explore these
issues. <BR>
<BR>
    </UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Technology Demonstrations and Briefings:</STRONG> Unique 
characteristics
of interactive communications media such as increased user control, real-time
communication, and ease of individualizing systems, have the potential to
enhance individual privacy through increased control over the disclosure,
generation, collection and use of personal information. Through timely 
demonstrations
and briefings, the Forum will seek to keep its members and the public up-to-date
on new developments within the privacy field as well as those in other areas
that may be adapted to advance fair information practices and privacy. <BR>
<BR>
  </UL>
<LI><STRONG>Public Education - Interactive World Wide Web Privacy 
Demonstration:</STRONG>
CDT is creating a demonstration project to make visible the extent of personally
revealing transactional information generated by individuals in the normal
course of browsing CDT's site. The demonstration will serve to illustrate
the extent of information that may be revealed to CDT, as well as third
parties, and potential ways to facilitate individual control over the collection
of such information.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Public Dialogue:</STRONG> CDT is continuing to engage in constructive
dialogue with others interested in advancing privacy in interactive communications
media. CDT is continuing to work closely with the Federal Trade Commission
on its Privacy Initiative and with the NTIA as it attempts to apply its
Principles for Providing and Using Personal Information to various sectors.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Scholarship:</STRONG> CDT staff will complete and seek to publish
an article on Privacy in the Interactive Age.<A NAME="PF_transact"></A>

<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>
<H3>The Privacy Forum's 1995 Transactional Privacy Activities</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The Forum's 1995 activities created a foundation on which to launch
a collaborative dialogue between the public and private sector for exploring
transactional privacy issues in interactive media. <STRONG>On December 12,
1995, the Forum held its first Policy and Technology Briefing to explore
transactional privacy issues.</STRONG> Participants in the December Briefing
raised a number of critical points that will inform our future activities:<BR>
<BR>
  <UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Advances in technology increase the magnitude of risk to individual
privacy.</STRONG> Shabbir Safdar of Voters Telecommunications Watch, noted
that numerous entities touch information flowing between any two points
on the Internet and each entity has the potential ability to capture, store
and reuse transactional data. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Questions regarding the generation, storage, and use of personal
transactional data.</STRONG> While there was consensus that the distinction
between the content of a communication and the transaction data generated
by that communication is blurring, the policy direction this observation
takes us in is unclear. One participant noted that the recently enacted
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (Pub. Law 103-414, October
1994), with its increased legal barriers to government access to transaction
data, signals that the private sector's use of this data is likely to come
under increased scrutiny. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Private sector and non-profit users of the Internet share
a deep commitment to protecting privacy.</STRONG> Clear rules are seen as
essential to building strong consumer trust and confidence. However, Link
Hoewing, from Bell Atlantic, and others cautioned that privacy policies
already in place in the telecommunications arena may not easily translate
into interactive environments, and that the fragmented, ad hoc policies
that regulate various industries differently are raising sticky problems
as media applications continue to converge, blurring what were once meaningful
distinctions. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Executive branch and other activities are increasing the urgency
with which privacy issues posed by interactive media must be addressed.</STRONG>
In 1995, the Federal Trade Commission launched a Privacy Initiative designed
to protect consumers in the emerging high-tech, global marketplace; the
NTIA released a report that concluded the private sector must implement
privacy standards or face a legislative mandate (the privacy equivalent
of Senator Exon's online indecency bill); the European Union finalized its
data protection directive which threatens to impede the flow of personal
information across national borders if adequate privacy standards and enforcement
mechanisms are not in place.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Interactive media offer enormous potential to advance privacy
interests by empowering people to exert greater control over their personal
information.</STRONG> As Jerry Berman of CDT pointed out, many of the recently
developed filtering devices that enable individuals to control information
they receive, offer a potentially powerful model for empowering users to
exercise increased control over personal information they disclose. In this
context, privacy interests must develop consistent with the free flow of
information and other fundamental interests. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Interactive Media can facilitate greater user control over
personally identifiable information online.</STRONG> Echoing a recent NTIA
report, Janlori Goldman of CDT concluded that interactivity may make possible
greater individual participation in personal information choices, however
a collaborative exploration of the full range of policy and technical options
is needed to seek solutions. 
  </UL>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Re-examining Policies Underlying Disclosure of Personal Information
from Public Records:</STRONG> In 1995, CDT's Privacy Forum completed its
examination of the existing policies underlying public records laws, culminating
in a full-day consultation attended by over 50 representatives from First
Amendment and privacy organizations, and information, communications and
computer industries. The increased ability to collect, store and transmit
data in digital media raise new wrinkles for rules governing public records.
The consultation focused on the heightening tension between the private
sector's need for access to public records and the growing privacy concerns
over disclosure of personal information in the interactive, digital, information
environment. A Forum-commissioned &quot;white paper&quot; served as the
foundation for the consultation. <A NAME="DAC"></A>
</UL>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="75%"></CENTER>
<H3>Digital Access Coalition</H3>
CDT is launching the Digital Access Coalition (DAC) in order to promote
affordable, nation-wide, high speed digital access to the Internet through
reasonable-priced ISDN service. The DAC will assemble a coalition of consumer,
education and library groups, together with small business and high technology
market leaders, to make the case for the necessity of rapid ISDN deployment
and feasibility of reasonable pricing structures.<BR>
<BR>
In recent years, ISDN has overcome its image as &quot;too little, too late&quot;
because of the availability of affordable Terminal Adapters, the success
of multimedia, PC-based computing, the World Wide Web, and the evident delays
in deploying true broadband services through either telecommunications or
cable networks. Indeed, ISDN has the potential to succeed as a mass market
communications service that offers affordable access to multimedia applications
such as the World Wide Web, advanced commercial online services, and a range
of video conferencing and telecommuting services. Such applications promise
tremendous benefit for education, library and other community-based applications,
and are certain to be a boon for small business in rural areas. Yet, ISDN
tariffs around the country are either non-existent or priced prohibitively
high. ISDN cannot bring benefits to the mass market if the service is priced
beyond mass-market levels. 
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Public/Private Coalition:</STRONG> The DAC plans to bring together
all who stand to benefit from widely available, affordable ISDN service
in order to advocate for reasonably-priced offering. Such a coalition --
including schools, libraries, small businesses, community economic development
groups, and large and small high-tech multimedia firms -- represent a powerful
force for stating the need for ISDN. With strong ties to the consumer movement
and the high technology sector, CDT is uniquely positioned to build such
a coalition. 
</UL>
<STRONG>DAC Activities:</STRONG> With a commitment to pool resources from
key DAC participants, the Working Group could commence work immediately
on the following activities: 
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Outreach:</STRONG> Invite interested parties from the public
and private sector to join the DAC efforts.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Policy Paper and Model Tariff Development:</STRONG> The keystone
of the DAC's advocacy effort should be a policy paper presenting the case
for affordable ISDN and economic analyses that demonstrate that low-price
tariffs are economically reasonable. Such a paper will give DAC members
a common message and provide Public Service Commissions a rationale for
progressive tariffing decisions.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Coordination with FCC ISDN Activities:</STRONG> The Federal
Communications Commission has shown a keen interest in promoting affordable
ISDN around the country. Thus, the DAC has an opportunity to work with the
Commission to help promote ISDN awareness.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Public Education:</STRONG> Promoting awareness of the value
of ISDN in the popular and trade press will be an essential component of
DAC activities.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Consultation with Local Telephone Companies:</STRONG> At least
some of the Regional Bell companies have a genuine interest in promoting
ISDN at mass market pricing. Moreover, these companies have expressed an
interest in developing consensus pricing approaches that satisfy the needs
of consumers and avoid unproductive, costly regulatory battles. 
</UL>
<STRONG>Track Record of the DAC and CDT:</STRONG> The DAC is a re-casting
of the original Open Platform<BR>
Working Group (OPWG), which first came together to promote affordable ISDN
pricing in 1992. OPWG coalition efforts resulted in the Open Platform services
sector of the 1994 Telecommunications Reform bill, which empowered the FCC
to promote and encourage reasonably priced ISDN service at the state level.
CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman and Deputy Director Daniel Weitzner,
both of whom were at the Electronic Frontier Foundation at the time, led
the Open Platform effort both in the U.S. Congress, and in several states
that now have reasonably priced ISDN service, such as Massachusetts, Tennessee
and California.<A NAME="WIF"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="75%"></CENTER>
<H3>World Internet Freedom Project</H3>
CDT is launching the World Internet Freedom Project (WIF) in Spring 1996.
The goal of the WIF is to establish awareness of the need for basic free
expression and privacy rights for Internet users around the world. As the
Internet grows, it has the potential to increase democratic political participation,
as well as to bring the economic opportunities of the Information Age to
communities around the world. Yet, neither the political nor economic potential
of the Internet will be realized unless basic free expression, free association,
free flow of information, and privacy rights are established and protected
internationally. <BR>
<BR>
In the last year alone, threats to free expression, free association, and
basic privacy of communications have mushroomed. Yet, there is no coordinated
international effort to enable individual rights advocates to mount a concerted
response to these threats. WIF will be a clearinghouse and organizing base
for public education and coalition-building in support of the political
and economic vitality of the Internet worldwide. <BR>
<BR>
The WIF will address the following critical issues: free expression and
the legal censorship regimes in individual countries as well as the impact
of local censorship on the Internet as a whole; free association and anonymity;
communications privacy and encryption; government interference with the
design of telecommunications networks; the lack of uniform, international
communications privacy protections; and cultural segregation that pose a
threat to the free flow of information globally. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Planning Phase:</STRONG> The planning phase for WIF is funded by
an initial grant from the Soros Foundation. Through this phase, CDT will
identify partners around the world who are committed to advancing democratic
values on the Internet. A small conference of key parties will be held in
the spring, 1996. From this conference, CDT will establish an international
advisory committee of activists and other leaders to guide the work of WIF.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Full Scale Operation:</STRONG> CDT is currently seeking funding
for the full scale operation of WIF that will include issue research, and
information collection and dissemination. Towards this end, proposed legislation,
relevant statutes, treaties, and other legal material would be made available
online on the World Wide Web. CDT will establish the WIF as a liaison between
international governments and non-governmental organizations. Further, the
WIF will serve as a presence in international bodies, and engage in public
education efforts aimed at the international press.<A NAME="special"></A><BR>

<H3>CDT Special Projects</H3>
In addition to coordinating public policy working groups and advancing our
own positions on critical free speech and privacy issues, CDT conducts research
and advocacy on several other important civil liberties issues, including:
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Health Information Privacy:</STRONG> CDT is committed to enhancing
and preserving information privacy during the transformation to a health
information infrastructure. CDT is working to ensure that strong, enforceable
privacy policy is in place to guide the design and implementation of health
information systems.<BR>
<BR>
  <UL>
  <LI><STRONG>National Policy:</STRONG> In October, 1995, Senators Bennett
(R-UT) and Leahy (D-VT) introduced the Medical Records Confidentiality Act
(S.1360). The introduction of S.1360, the strongest and most comprehensive
health privacy legislation ever considered by Congress, is a key milestone
in CDT's effort to press for a policy that protects the privacy of personal
health information. <BR>
<BR>
In November, 1995, CDT testified in support of S.1360 before the Senate
Committee on Labor and Human Resources. The Senate plans to take action
on the bill in spring, 1996. CDT has been asked to testify in March, 1996
on a similar House measure. <BR>
<BR>
A CDT-initiated working group of civil liberties and patients' rights groups,
along<BR>
with representatives of the health, information, and communications industry,
will continue to press for the strongest, most effective health information
privacy policy. Georgetown Law School's Federal Legislation Clinic is providing
CDT with legal assistance in this activity. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>State Health Information Systems:</STRONG> CDT continues its
hands-on involvement with a number of Community Health Information Systems
sites (CHMIS). With the support of the Hartford Foundation and the Foundation
for Health Care Quality, CDT provides policy and technology expertise to
the CHMIS sites on privacy, confidentiality and security issues. The Center's
work with the CHMIS sites includes assisting state legislative efforts to
protect privacy, participating in policy discussions regarding access and
use of personal health information, and recommending appropriate policies
and technologies for health information systems. During 1996, CDT will complete
a &quot;Privacy Manual&quot; providing policy recommendations to the CHMIS
sites, and a set of educational materials designed to empower citizens to
better protect the privacy of their health records for use by civil liberties,
patients' rights, and consumer groups in grass-roots educational activities.
<BR>
<BR>
  </UL>
<LI><STRONG>Public Access to Government Information -- E-FOIA:</STRONG>
CDT has been working with congressional staff, the Clinton Administration,
press, and open government advocates to develop a revised version of the
Electronic Freedom of Information Act amendments that passed the Senate
in the 103rd Congress.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Online Publications and Resources:</STRONG> Our very popular
Web site is a key spot on the Internet for information on civil liberties
in cyberspace (See URL:http://www.cdt.org). CDT's World Wide Web site was
rated among the top 5% of sites on the Web by Point Survey; &quot;Best of
the Web&quot; by 2ask Survey; and received 3 out of 4 stars from NetGuide
Magazine. The site is widely recognized as the leading source for information
on public policy issues affecting civil liberties online. In addition, our
regular online publication, the CDT Policy Post, has a direct circulation
of 9,000, and is read by thousands more on Usenet newsgroups and our online
archives. <A NAME="staff"></A>

<h1>Democratic Values for a Digital Age </h1>
<P>
<h2>1995 Activities of the <br>

Center for Democracy and Technology 
<P>
February 1995</h2></center><p><hr size = 6><p>

<h2>I.  Overview</h2>

<P>
The Center for Democracy and Technology is an independent, non-profit
public interest policy organization in Washington, DC. The Center's
mission is to develop and implement public policies to protect
and advance individual liberty and democratic values in new digital
media. The Center achieves its goals through policy development,
public education, and coalition building. 
<P>
With the rapid growth of new media including the Internet, interactive
television networks and multimedia information services, many
proponents emphasize their potential to increase entertainment,
commerce, and education.  Pundits and policy makers also assure
us that free speech and privacy will be preserved and our democratic
institutions strengthened by new communication opportunities.
But little actual attention is devoted to assuring that democracy
and constitutional values are protected and enhanced by digital
media.
<P>
The Center for Democracy and Technology has been founded to advance
these values in the public policy debates over the evolving communications
infrastructure. The Center will strive to achieve its goals by
working with public interest groups, the communications and computer
industry, and policy makers of all political persuasions to build
coalitions in support of practical policies and solutions . The
Center, founded by Jerry Berman, Janlori Goldman, and Daniel Weitzner,
marshals legal, technical, and public policy expertise on behalf
of civil liberties goals, including:
<P>
<B>Maximizing free speech and the free flow of information in
on-line and interactive media:  </B>
<P>
Interactive media, unlike mass media, feature abundant bandwidth,
diverse programming, and increased control by users over programming
they  receive and information with which they interact. These
characteristics of new  media increasingly undermine past rationales
and future effectiveness of  government speech content restrictions
which have dominated the mass media.  Interactive media requires
alternative, less intrusive, means-often relying on  technology
rather than content regulation-for achieving public ends. 
<P>
<i>Critical Free Speech Issues in 1995:</i>
<UL>
<LI>Exon Amendment: extending indecency liability to all online
services;
<LI>Third Party liability for intellectual property infringement.
</UL>

<P>
<P>
The Center will oppose government efforts to impose limits on
free speech in interactive information services and work with
the private sector and policy makers to investigate and develop
alternative policy and technology options  which meet legitimate
government objectives without limiting constitutionally protected
free speech or stultifying the potential of new media to maximize
content diversity. 
<P>
<B>Giving citizens more control over sensitive personal information:
 </B>
<P>
The Center believes that the use of personal information about
citizens to conduct  transactions in electronic media pose threats
to individual privacy.  At  the same  time, new technology may
help citizens better control the use of information about  themselves.
 The Center will work with privacy advocates, the business and
 communications industry, and public policy makers to develop
self regulatory and public policy solutions to strengthen fair
information practices and explore ways in which interactive technologies
can increase citizen control over the use of  personal information
held by government and other third party institutions.
<P>
<i>Critical Information Privacy Issues in 1995</i>
<UL>
<LI>Access to public records;\Health information privacy;
<LI>Online service transactional records access.
<LI>Protecting communications privacy in a global network environment:
</UL>
<P>
<B>Enhancing communications privacy in digital environments</B>
<P>
With increased reliance on digital communications for sensitive
personal, political, and financial information, the Center believes
that  the law must be constantly updated to protect communications
privacy. But laws are not enough. The availability of privacy-protecting
technology is critical to enable individuals and institutions
to protect their privacy.  The Center will work to assure that
there is broad access to encryption technology, and will continue
to insure that the privacy of personal communications are legally
protected from unauthorized access. 
<P>
<i>Critical Digital Privacy Issues in 1995:</i>
<UL>
<LI>Encryption export controls;
<LI>Digital Telephony bill implementation before the FCC;
<LI>Clipper alternatives and private key escrow proposals.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<B>Guaranteeing public access to electronic government information:</B>  
<P>
New computer and communication technologies can enhance public
access to government information.  However, the Freedom of Information
Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and other access statutes predate
the PC revolution. The Center will work to reform these laws to
expand the public's right to know in the digital age. 
<P>
<i>Critical Information Access Issues in 1995:</i>
<UL>
<LI>Electronic Freedom of Information Act amendments (EFOIA);
<LI>Paperwork Reduction Act amendments.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Identifying network architecture that serve democratic values
</B>: 
<P>
The national and international information infrastructure is
growing rapidly, but is still in very early stages of deployment.
The Center believes that the design choices made now will have
a critical impact on the free speech, access, and privacy. The
Center will monitor technology trends to identify network developments
which contribute to universal digital access and other democratic
goals.<p><hr size = 6><p>  
<a name="2"></a><H2>II. Summary of 1995 Activities</H2>

<P>
The Center for Democracy and Technology plans to work on privacy,
security, free speech, access to public information, and open
network issues by conducting the following projects. 
<p>
<b>A. Protecting Communications Privacy: The Digital Privacy and Security Working Group Project
</B>
<P>
The Center will coordinate the Digital Privacy and Security Working
Group (DPSWG), a coalition of over 50 computer, communications,
and civil liberties organizations and associations working on
communications privacy and security issues.  
<P>
The Center, on its own and through the DPSWG, will vigorously
monitor the implementation of the newly enacted Digital Telephony
Statute, &quot;The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement
Act of 1994.&quot;  The law contains procedures that permit privacy
organizations and industry to intervene at the FCC with respect
to standards setting, cost reimbursement, and privacy protection
issues.  The Center will work to insure that the spirit and intent
of the bill are adhered to and use every opportunity to enforce
public accountability by requiring the government to reimburse
industry for the cost of meeting statutory wiretap capability
and capacity requirements.  
<P>
In addition, the Center will continue to oppose mandatory government
escrowed encryption.  Despite the recently  announced reexamination
of policy, the Clinton Administration has made it clear that it
intends to pursue government escrowed encryption, rigid, secret
national cryptography standards, and ongoing export controls on
encryption which pose significant impediments to privacy and innovation
in digital media. The Center and the  DPSWG will form a task force
to study and report on the privacy and security implications of
public key private, non-governmental escrow systems. 
<P>
In its  effort to end export controls on cryptography, the Center
will state its views in the context of the National Research Council's
study. The Center will present its input through briefings, presentations,
consultations, and testimony at regional public hearings.  The
Center will also work with DPSWG members to educate the new Congress
on these critical security and privacy issues.</ul>
<P>
<B>B. Safeguarding Personal Information in the Digital Age: The
Privacy Forum Project</B>
<P>
The Center will conduct an ongoing Privacy Forum to serve as a
common meeting ground for public interest groups and business
organizations who want to explore policy options for resolving
transactional and database privacy issues  posed by new technologies.

<P>
The Forum will bring together key privacy, consumer and business
interests on an on-going basis to explore issues based on a mutual
commitment to find solutions that strike a balance between privacy
and fair information practices and other important public interests,
including: 
<UL><p>
<LI>access to public information; 
<LI>free speech and the free flow of information;
<LI>maximizing consumer choice;
<LI>fostering  business innovation in the information economy,
and; 
<LI>the development of a multimedia information superhighway.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The Privacy Forum's agenda includes studying ways to balance the
competing privacy, First Amendment and economic interests posed
 by recent initiatives to restrict access to and use of public
records such as motor vehicle registrations, voting records, and
real estate transactions.
<P>
The Privacy Forum will also identify problems and solutions regarding
the privacy of transactional information created and used in the
conduct of electronic commerce, politics, and entertainment over
telephone, cable, and wireless networks. 
<P>
The Privacy Forum will also work with the online service providers,
including America Online, Compuserve, Delphi, Ziff-Davis Interactive,
Interchange Online Network, civil liberties groups, and privacy
experts to  develop model self-regulatory consumer privacy policies
for interactive services. The issues will be developed through
research and explored in depth at an all day consultation in the fall of 1995.
<P>
The Privacy Forum will also explore new technology driven means
for enforcing and abiding by fair information practices.  The
Forum will meet to discuss how interactive technology can give
citizens new means for &quot;filtering&quot; or &quot;opting out&quot;
and correcting, which at the same time providing  businesses with
more accurate and relevant information about who wants to receive
specific products and services.In addition to the Privacy Forum,
the Center will continue its work on Health Care Privacy Reform
sponsored by the Hartford Foundation.</ul><p> 
<b>C. Protecting Free Speech: The Interactive Working Group Project</b>

<P>
The Center will organize and  coordinate the work of the Interactive
Working Group in 1995. The IWG is a Center effort to bring together
major on-line service providers (America On-line, Compuserve,
AT&amp;T Interactive, Delphi, Prodigy), new entrants into interactive
services such as telephone and cable companies, and public interest
groups  to work together to develop policies and guidelines designed
to maximize First Amendment values, privacy, commerce, and innovation
 rapidly developing interactive on-line media. 
<P>
The introduction of legislation by Senators Exon and Conrad and
others to limit indecent and violent programming in interactive
and cable networks underscore the importance of establishing a
working group to explore alternatives and less intrusive means
for achieving public ends without violating free speech. 
<P>
The Center, working with the IWG, will prepare a white paper,
conduct meetings and conferences, and engage in public education
on behalf of the IWG, to lay the groundwork for an alternative
to content restrictions in new interactive media.  The white paper
will:
<UL><p>
<LI>explain that interactive media, as contrasted with traditional
broadcast media, will be characterized by an abundance of content
carried over potentially unlimited numbers of communications paths;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>demonstrate that  traditional content restrictions, designed
to be enforced by network content providers, are going to be difficult
if not impossible to police or make effective without severely
restricting the free flow of information; 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>show the ability and potential of the new interactive media
to increase user (especially parental) control over the content
of media received into the home; and 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>advocate that rather than the government enforcing community
standards, each citizen should be afforded the opportunity and
ability to choose or self-select programming consistent with their
own particularized community standards and values. 
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The Center and the IWG will outline a regulatory model for non-mass
media interactive services which (a) permits interactive service
providers to transmit, without liability, all lawful content,
commercial or non-commercial, provided that they  (b) clearly
identify the nature of the programming (adult, tobacco sponsored,
general viewing, etc.) and  provide subscribers  user-friendly
means for making viewer choices for themselves and their children.
<P></ul>
<B>D. Expanding the Public Right to Know: The Electronic Public
Information  Project</B>
<P>
This year Congress will again take up legislation to establish
a right of access to the electronic version of public information
by amending the Freedom of Information Act.  Congress will also
consider amendments to the Paperwork Reduction Act, which has
important implications for governmental dissemination obligations,
and the balance between reliance on public, versus private access
options.
<P>
The Center, together with public interest groups, the information
industry, and press organizations, will work to expand public
access to electronic government information.</ul> 
<P>
<B>E. Open Networks: Network Architecture and Democracy Study
Project.</B>
<P>
As the public policy debate about the National Information Infrastructure
continues, the Center, working with non-profits, and others who
share free speech and diversity goals, will strive to expand and
enlighten the debate over the relationship between various network
architecture options and democratic values.  The Center believes
there is a critical need for independent research and analysis
which reflects on the health, vitality, and growth of networks.
Critical technology options are often overlooked by both policy
makers and public interest organizations because the sources of
technical information are generally limited to the very network
owners and operators who are the subject of any given policy debate.
 If the NII is to be a true open platform, public policy must
be guided by independent technology assessment undertaken with
open network goals in mind.
<P>
The Center's Network Architecture and Democracy Study Project
 will track and analyze technology and market trends in the growth
networks.  The Center study will be undertaken in consultation
with public interest organizations such as the Benton Foundation,
the Consumer Federation of America, People for the American Way,
the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Progress and Freedom
Foundation. The Project will strive to facilitate a dialogue between
the public interest community, the communications and computer
industry, and policy makers on open network goals. 
<P>
When the 104th Congress consider telecommunications legislation,
the Center will be at the core of the debate over the public interest
in the development of the Information Infrastructure.  Center
staff, all of whom have had substantial involvement in the telecommunications
debate over the last several years, will monitor the legislative
developments to assure that the following values are served:<p>
<UL>
<LI>Affordable access to high-speed, switched, digital services
available at nondiscriminatory rates and terms;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Nationwide access to interconnected network services for rural
and urban areas alike.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The Center will also work with other public interest organizations
and industry groups to identify options for insuring continued
access to non-commercial programming and information sources.
<P>
<h2><a name="3"></a>III. Funding</h2>
<P>
The Center is a 501&#169;(3) (application pending) organization
and receives funding from individuals, foundations, and a representative
cross-section of the communications and computer industry.<p>

<a href ="mailto:jberman@cdt.org">jberman@cdt.org</a>
<p>
<p>
Jerry Berman is the Executive Director of the Center for Democracy and Technology 
(CDT) in Washington, DC. CDT is an independent, non-profit public interest policy 
organization whose mission is to develop and implement public policies to protect 
and advance individual liberty and democratic values in new digital media. The

<p>
<h3>My Bio</h3>
<p>
As Policy Analyst for the <a href = "http://www.cdt.org">Center for Democracy and Technology</a>, Mr. Seiger performs research and analysis on telecommunications infrastructure and communications privacy issues. Current issues include Congressional efforts to regulate content on the Internet (the Exon/Coats CDA and other proposals),  cryptography policy, and the implementation of the 'Digital Telephony" legislation.  Mr. Seiger also works with Congressional Staff and Industry representatives to develop alternative policies for the Internet which maximize freedom of expression and privacy.
<p>
As CDT's online organizer, Mr. Seiger has pioneered the use of the 
Internet as a means of grass-roots organizing and public education. In 
June of 1996, Mr. Seiger worked with Senator Burns to put the <a href = 
"http://www.crypto.com/hearing-6-26-96/">first Congressional Hearing on 
the Internet</a>. Mr. Seiger has played a key role in organizing several 
high profile online demonstrations, including an <a href = "http 
://www.cdt.org/petition.html">online petition</a> which generated over 
115,000 signatures in opposition to the Exon Communications Decency Act, and a <a href = "http://politicsusa.com/PoliticsUSA/news/1214pm05.html.cgi">"National Day of Protest"</a>  which generated over 20,000 phone calls, faxes and email messages to members of Congress on December 12, 1995, and the <a href = "http://www.cdt.org/speech.html">"Black Thursday Protest"</a> in which over 2000 World Wide Web sites went black to protest the enactment of the CDA.  Mr. Seiger also  writes and edits CDT Policy Posts, the Center's online newsletter.
<p>
Mr. Seiger's publications have appeared in <a href = "http://www.wired.com/wired/4.12/crn/index.html">Wired Magazine</a>, Communications of the ACM, Security Management, and others.
<p>
Prior to joining CDT, Mr. Seiger was Project Coordinator at the <a href = 
"http://www.eff.org"> Electronic Frontier Foundation </a>, and also 
worked with Representative Edward Markey at the House  Telecommunications 
Subcommittee. <p>
Mr. Seiger is a native of Palo Alto California, and holds a B.A. in 
Psychology and Studies in Religion from the <a href = "http://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a>.

<p>
Janlori Goldman is Deputy Director and co-founder of the Center for Democracy and 
Technology (CDT),  a not-for-profit, public interest organization in Washington, 
D.C.   The Center's mission is to develop and advocate public policies that advance 
constitutional civil liberties and democratic values in new computer and 
communications technologies. 
<p>
Prior to founding the Center for Democracy and Technology, Ms. Goldman was at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and from 1986 to 1994 she was Staff Counsel and Director of the Privacy and Technology Project of the American Civil Liberties Union. Ms. Goldman led a coalition to draft and enact the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988.

<title>Celebrating the Formation of CDT -- April 26, 1995</title>

<b>The Guests of Honor: -- Congressman Don Edwards (Ret.)</b> (2nd from left) and <b>Senator Patrick Leahy</b> (middle), with CDT Deputy Director Daniel Weitzner, CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman, and CDT Deputy Director Janlori Goldman<p>
<p>
<h2>Celebrating the Formation of CDT</h2>
<p>
The Center for Democracy and Technology was born over hot soup and dumplings at <b>Eat First</b>, a hole-in-the-wall chinese resturant in DC's Chinatown. When it came time to have a party to celebrate the formation of the organization, we couldn't think of a better place. So on April 26, 1995 CDT invited Senator Leahy, Congressman Don Edwards, and 100 of our closest friends and colleagues to eat, drink, and enjoy the place where we were born.

(1) COURT GRANTS INJUNCTION ON CDA; UNANIMOUS DECISION IS A MAJOR VICTORY
    FOR FREE SPEECH ON THE INTERNET!

At 9:00 am this morning (6/12), a three-judge panel of federal judges
in Philadelphia, PA granted CIEC's request for a preliminary injunction
against the Communications Decency Act (CDA).   In a unanimous decision, 
the judges ruled that the CDA would unconstitutionally restrict speech on
the Internet.

This is a major victory for Netizens!  The ruling today soundly rejects
Congressional attempts to censor the Internet.  However, the government 
will most certainly appeal this case to the Supreme Court, so the battle
against the CDA is not over yet.  All Internet users are encouraged to 
join the fight against the CDA as the case moves to the Supreme Court.

Excerpts from the decision:

     "As the most participatory form of mass speech yet developed, the
      Internet deserves the highest protection from government intrusion."

     "Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so the strength of 
      our liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the unfettered
      speech the First Amendment protects."

The full text of the decision, including a compressed downloadable version,
as well as information on how to join the CIEC, is available at the CIEC web
page:

More information about the decision, including analysis of the 175-page 
opinion, will be posted over the next few days.

DECISION IN INTERNET CHALLENGE HAILED AS VICTORY FOR PARENTS, CHILDREN
AND AMERICAN TRADITION OF FREE SPEECH 

PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania -- Parents, librarians, online companies, 
publishers, newspaper reporters and others challenging government 
censorship of cyberspace today hailed an historic decision by a 
federal court enjoining the government from enforcing portions of a
new law which violate constitutionally protected free speech.  

But plaintiffs in the American Library Association v. U.S. Department
of Justice suit warned that the battle against the Communications 
Decency Act may not be over if the government appeals today's decision
to the Supreme Court. 

"This is a victory for the Internet and for everyone who values free
speech," said Jerry Berman of the Center for Democracy and Technology
and a co-founder of the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition that
organized the suit. 

In their 175-page decision, the three judge panel of the U.S. District 
Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvnia found the law 
unconstitutional on grounds that it violated rights of free speech. All
three judges -- Dolores K. Sloviter, chief judge of the U.S. Third 
Circuit Court of Appeals, and U.S. District Judges Ronald L. Buckwalter
and Stewart Dalzell wrote individual opinions supporting the panel's 
unanimous decision to enforce an injunction against the government.

"Our findings of fact -- many of them undisputed -- express our 
understanding of the Internet.  These Findings lead to the conclusion
that Congress may not regulate indecency on the Internet at all," wrote
Judge Dalzell, referring to the extensive study of the Internet.  

The Judges concluded: the "plaintiffs have shown irreparable injury, no
party has any interest in the enforcement of an unconstitutional law, and
therefore the public interest will be served by granting a preliminary
injunction."

The 27 plaintiffs in the case, which was joined by the court with another
suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, complained that the law
imposed criminal penalities on speech in cyberspace that is otherwise 
entirely lawful.  It was the first time in American history that criminal
penalities had been placed on the exercise of free speech. 

The result of the unconstitutional law was that books legal on library 
shelves could land a librarian in jail if posted on-line. The terms used
in the law were so vague that they encompassed vast amounts of material 
with literary, artistic, political, cultural and medical value, and 
threatened to penalize people who did not realize they were violating a law.

The law was not aimed at curbing obscenity or child pornography on the 
Internet, which already are against the law. 

"We are ecstatic. Librarians can continue to provide ideas and information
to the public regardless of the format, without concern about fines or jail
terms," said Judith Krug from the American Library Association. "This is 
victory for anyone who uses the public libraries."

In addition, the law would fail in its goal of protecting children since 
large amounts of material on the Internet originate overseas, beyond the 
reach of U.S. law. 

During five days of hearings, plaintiffs showed the court the unique nature
of the new medium and demonstrated software that allows parents to easily
monitor and control the material coming into homes and schools. Plaintiffs
argued that such technology was more effective than any law, empowered users
to make their own judgements about what they wanted to see and protected
Americans' First Amendment rights to free expression. 

"The court today did for children and adults what Congress did not -- It
decided that parental control tools combined with user education and
enforcement of existing laws is a more effective and constitutional way to
protect children and safeguard our freedoms," said Bill Burrington, Assistant
General Counsel of America Online.

Other countries were watching the outcome of the case closely. Many nations,
such as Germany, France and Japan, are just beginning to grapple with
Internet issues. Other nations, such as China and Saudi Arabia, already have
imposed strict controls on the medium, which Judge Dalzell referred to during
the hearings as "the most democratic medium yet devised by the imagination of
man." 

"This court is the first to fully grapple with and grasp the unique nature 
and potential of the Internet. The court's decision today to afford 
communications over the Internet heightened protections recognizes the value
of this new medium in a democracy," said Bruce J. Ennis, lead attorney in the
case. "This decision will help define the legal framework for future decision
related to the Internet."

The plaintiffs in the case include: American Library Association, Inc.;
America Online, Inc.; American Booksellers Association, Inc.; American 
Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression; American Society of Newspaper
Editors; Apple Computer, Inc.; Association of American Publishers, Inc.;
Association of Publishers, Editors and Writers; Commercial Internet eXchange

(1) Court Orders DOJ to Halt &quot;Reviews&quot; Under the CDA

In response to a complaint filed last week by the CIEC, a Federal Judge in
Philadelphia Wednesday ordered the Justice Department to stop all &quot;reviews&quot;
of complaints under the Communications Decency Act until the three-judge
panel rules on the constitutionality of the law.   The order was issued by
Judge Stewart Dalzell, one of the three judges presiding over the case.

CIEC attorneys filed the compliant after several national newspapers 
reported last week that the FBI had opened an investigation of CompuServe
for violations of the CDA.  The FBI has since denied that any investigation 
is or was underway, though the stories sparked a great deal of confusion 
and created a significant public relations problem for the commercial 
online service.

In the order Judge Dalzell stated that &quot;the government's conduct in
subjecting a content provider to private and public scrutiny for displaying
material that is neither obscene nor child pornography clearly runs afoul
of both this Court's orders and the government's promises.&quot;

Closing arguments in the case concluded on Friday May 10, and a final
decision on the constitutionality of the CDA is expected soon.  While
Wednesday's ruling by Judge Dalzell provides little insight into which way
the court will rule on the constitutionality of the CDA, the speed with
which the order was issued does show that the court appreciates the
tremendous free speech and commercial concerns riding on this case.

The full text of the seven page order, tramscripts from Friday's oral
arguments, and with other relevant information, is available at the
Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition web page:

  http://www.cdt.org/ciec

BACKGROUND ON THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT/AFA FOLLIES

After a Philadelphia federal judge granted a temporary restraining order
against the CDA in February, the government agreed not to prosecute or
investigate anyone for violations of the CDA until the court challenge had
been completed.   However, recent events have called the government's
commitment to the February agreement into question.

In early April, the conservative American Family Association (AFA) filed a
complaint with the Justice Department accusing Compuserve of violating the
CDA for material in a forum called MacGlamour, despite the fact that the
site was labeled for adults only and Compuserve provides its users free
software to block access to unwanted material.

Last week in response to pressure from the AFA, acting Chief of the DOJ
Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section Terry Lord sent a letter to AFA
director Patrick Truman indicating that the Department &quot;has referred [the
AFA] letter and accompanying materials to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for further review.&quot;

The FBI denied it was investigating, which would have been a violation of
the February court agreement, but said it was &quot;reviewing&quot; the AFA
complaint.  CIEC attorneys asked the court to clarify if such a &quot;review&quot;
violated the government's promise not to investigate or prosecute under the
CDA.

In granting the motion for clarification, Judge Dalzell ordered Attorney
General Reno, the Justice Department, and the FBI to stop all &quot;reviews&quot; of
online indecency complaints pending a decision regarding the
constitutionality of the Communications Decency Act.

Quote of the Day: "You are asking us to re-write the statute, to put
                   words in the statute that aren't there. We want you
                   to tell us what words to put in"

-- Judge Doloris Sloviter, to DOJ lead counsel Tony Coppolino during a
   series of questions on the government's interpretation of the term 
   "indecency"

HEARINGS CONCLUDE IN CDA CHALLENGE -- DECISION EXPECTED SOON

Hearings in the historic legal battle over the future of freedom of speech
on the Internet concluded Friday (5/10) with both sides presenting final
oral arguments before a three judge panel in a Philadelphia Federal Court.
A decision in the case is expected within the next month, after which
either side can appeal directly to the Supreme Court.

As expected, the Government lawyers argued that the court should read the
Communications Decency Act's (CDA)  prohibition of "indecent" and "patently
offensive" materials online to apply only to hard-core, sexually explicit
material.

The Government asked the court to essentially create a new definition of
the term "indecent", designed specifically for the Internet.  While DOJ
lead attorney Tony Coppolino stated that the government believes the term
"indecent" in the CDA should have the same meaning  as used by the FCC ,
and in the Pacifica and Sable cases, Coppolino also repeatedly argued that
the term "indecent" under the CDA would not apply to serious works of
fiction, art, or other materials with social value.  This argument is
inconsistent with every application of the "indecency" standard in past
court cases and regulatory proceedings before the FCC.

The Government summed up its case by arguing  that the content regulations
imposed by the CDA, combined with parental control technologies, are
necessary in order to protect children from sexually explicit material on
the Internet.  The Government argued that technology alone will not protect
children from sexually explicit material on the Internet. As DOJ lawyer
Jason Baron stated, the law must "put the burden on content providers to do
something" to prevent minors from accessing objectionable material online.

CIEC lead counsel Bruce Ennis urged the court to overturn the
Communications Decency Act on the grounds that the law is overly broad,
unconstitutionally vague, and effectively restricts all speech on the
Internet to that which is appropriate only for children.  Ennis further
argued that the CDA's defenses to prosecution are not available to the vast
majority of speakers on the Net. While commercial content providers may be
able to utilize credit card age verification schemes, non-commercial
speakers, who comprise the majority of speakers on the Internet, have no
way of complying with the statue.

Ennis argued that the CDA is "substantially overboard", meaning that in
most circumstances there is simply no way for Internet users to comply with
the law.   "Substantial over breadth", one of several standards the CIEC
has asked the court to consider in evaluating the constitutionality of the
CDA, requires that the court consider whether the law is overly broad in a
"substantial number" of its applications.  In this case, Ennis argued that
the CDA can only be considered constitutional in one application:
commercial content providers who charge for their services.  In every other
application, including posts to Usenet Newsgroups, IRC or other online chat
forums, electronic mail sent to public mailing lists, and non-commercial
web sites, the defenses to prosecution under the CDA are not available to
Internet users. As a result, non-commercial speakers on the Internet only
have one way to avoid potential liability under the CDA - self censorship.

As expected, the Judges adjourned the Hearing without reaching a decision,
but promised that a decision would be forthcoming.  CDT will provide an
update as soon as a decision is reached (check http://www.cdt.org/ciec/)
for updates). A decision is expected before the end of May.

RECENT FBI 'NON-INVESTIGATION' OF COMPUSERVE BECOMES A MAJOR ISSUE

In what is perhaps the most interesting twist yet in this case, the recent
newspaper reports that the FBI was considering an investigation of
Compuserve for potential violations of the CDA were raised by CIEC lawyers
and Judge Dalzell. The reports were sparked by calls from the conservative
American Family Association, though the FBI and Justice Department have
since clarified that no investigation is underway.

During the presentation of Government attorney Jason Baron, Judge Dalzell
asked numerous questions about a recent letter from Assistant Attorney
General Keene to the Judge in a parallel CDA challenge in New York.  In the
letter, Keene states that labeling content, registering a URL with a "URL
registry", and using content selection standards would be considered
"substantial evidence" that a defendant has complied with the defenses
under the CDA.

The Government's position that labeling content would only be considered
"substantial evidence" and not  an outright defense to prosecution (as a
literal reading of the CDA suggests) raises serious questions about the
ability of any content provider to comply with the CDA, and adds further
weight to the CIEC arguments that the CDA is overly broad and
unconstitutionally restrictive.

THE NEWSPAPER DECENCY ACT?

In numerous, often pointed questions throughout the hearing, the Judges
pressed the government on whether the Internet is, as the CIEC and ACLU
cases argue, a unique communications technology distinct from traditional
broadcast mass media.

At one point Judge Dalzell, holding up a copy of the Philadelphia Inquirer,
noted that the previous day's issue contained a graphic image of a man
being shot on the front page above the fold.  Dalzell said that his 10 year
old son had seen this picture while looking for the scores from the
previous day's Philadelphia Phillies game, Dalzell was concerned that the
Image was not appropriate for a young child to view.  Dalzell asked
Coppolino if Congress were to pass a "Newspaper Decency Act" requiring that
Newspapers publish graphic images below the fold (so that minors do not
inadvertently see them) would the law be unconstitutional.

When Coppolino agreed that the hypothetical Newspaper Decency Act would
indeed be unconstitutional, Dalzell asked if Congress similarly has the
power to control the Internet. Coppolino argued that the Internet is much
more similar to broadcast mass media than print.  Coppolino further argued
that the Internet is a pervasive medium, and that because the Internet can
deliver text, graphics, video and sound, and that because of this
convergence the Internet is much closer to the broadcasting model than it
is to the print medium.

The question of the nature of the Internet and its similarity to the print
or broadcast medium is a critical issue in this case. If the Judges find
that the Internet is substantially different from broadcast mass media,
they are more likely to rule that the broadcast-style content regulations
imposed by the CDA are unconstitutional.  Although Judge Dalzell revealed
little about this position on this issue during the hearing, his
hypothetical questions were none-the-less encouraging.

WHAT IS INDECENT?

While the judges asked pointed questions of both sides, the most piercing
questions were reserved or DOJ lead attorney Tony Coppolino on the meaning
of the term "indecent".

Before Coppolino had finished the first sentence of his opening statement,
he was interrupted by Judge Doloris Sloviter, who asked, "What is the
Government's position about what the statute covers?". Sloviter was
referring to the Government's position on the meaing of the terms
"indecent" and "patently offensive", which is a critical question in the
case.

Coppolino responded that the government believes the terms refer to
sexually explicit material which lacks any serious literary, artistic,
social or scientific value.  Judge Solviter responded by asking whether
excerpts from the Broadway play "Angles in America" (which deals with
AIDS), might be considered indecent in some jurisdictions.  Coppolino
responded that "it is possible that some material with value might be
considered 'indecent'", and that "the application depends on the
communication and its context".

A skeptical Judge Stewart Dalzell wondered aloud whether the definition of
the term would be left up to the 94 US attorneys throughout the United
States, each with a potentially different interpretation, citing the
example of the controversial photographer Robert Maplethorp, whose exhibit
was celebrated in Philadelphia and subsequently picketed in Cincinnati Ohio
several years ago.  Dalzell noted that a Web site at the University of
California Riverside has placed an explicit Maplethorp photograph online,
and asked Coppolino what advice he would give the University if he were
their lawyer.

Coppolino responded that he would not necessarily advise the University of
take the materials off-line, and suggested that they could further protect
themselves from liability under the CDA by providing the ability for
parents to block the site. Judge Sloviter appeared unconvinced with
Coppolino's explanation, stating, "Isn't there a chill factor [here]?  This
is a criminal statute.  People are entitled to know what they can be
prosecuted for.  If people have to keep running to their lawyers, isn't
that a problem?"

(1) TESTIMONY ENDS IN COURT BATTLE TO OVERTURN THE CDA - CLOSING ARGUMENTS SET
    FOR MAY 10

Hearings ended today in the constitutional challenge to the Communications
Decency Act with the cross-examination of government witness Dan Olsen. The
court also announced today that closing arguments in this landmark case
will be heard on May 10 (the hearing had originally been scheduled for June
3).

Dan Olsen, Chair of the Department of Computer Science Brigham Young
University, testified on Friday April 12 about a scheme he developed two
weeks ago for rating sexually-explicit content on the Internet.  Olsen's
proposal would require content providers to label their sites with an
"-L18" tag if the site contains sexually oriented material.  During cross
examination on Friday and again today, CIEC and ACLU lawyers criticized
Olsen's proposal as inflexible and extremely difficult to implement.

All three judges presiding over the case -- Dolores Sloviter, chief judge
of the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and the U.S. District Judges
Stewart Dalzell and Ronald Buckwalter -- questioned Olsen for almost 45
minutes about his proposal, and seemed unconvinced by his presentation.

At one point, Judge Sloviter asked, "I am wondering if whether in essence
your scheme requires some material to be blocked in advance, and if you can
think of any time in our history when we have blocked material in advance
in an organized fashion?"

Olsen replied that he believed newspaper editors did this routinely.  In
response to another question from Judge Sloviter, Olsen admitted his plan
would "make it easier for the government to censor material" on the
Internet if it one day chose to do so directly.

GOVERNMENT RESTS ITS CASE AFTER CALLING ONLY TWO WITNESSES

The government rested its case today after calling only two witnesses in
defense of the Communications Decency Act.  The CIEC and ACLU cases called
a total of 13 witnesses. Interestingly, over two days of hearings, neither
witness offered testimony explicitly defending the CDA as written. Instead,
the testimony appeared designed to convince the court that the CDA is
narrowly drawn and therefore satisfies the "least restrictive means" test.


In short, the government witnesses testified:

* That sexually explicit material is available to minors on the Internet
  (a claim that neither the CIEC nor the ACLU challenges dispute).

* Requiring content providers to label content will prevent minors from
  accessing sexually explicit material on the Internet.

CIEC and ACLU attorneys argue that the content labeling scheme proposed by
Olsen is would not be a "good faith defense" under the CDA, and is
therefore irrelevant, and that the Government has not proven that the
Communications Decency Act is the "least restrictive means" of protecting
children from inappropriate material on the Internet.

Speaking to reporters at the end of today's hearing, CIEC lead attorney
Bruce Ennis summarized the last two days of testimony by saying, " ... in
the final analysis parents have the ability and the technology to control
what kids see ... without reducing all content on the Internet to the level
appropriate for an eight-year-old."  Ennis added, "This law is
unconstitutional."

CLOSING ARGUMENTS SET FOR MAY 10

On May 10, the plaintiffs and the government will each present two hours of
closing arguments.  A decision is expected from the three judge panel in
mid-June. Any appeal of the ruling will be made directly to the Supreme
Court under expedited review provisions of the Telecommunications Reform
Act.

Quote of the Day: "Come on line with us, and your kids won't see
                   what is in [DOJ lead attorney] Mr. Coppalino's book"
                   of sexually explicit images found online.

-- Judge Stewart Dalzell, suggesting how service providers might market
   PICS compatible Internet services

(1) GOVERNMENT ARGUES CDA IS NECESSARY AND NOT OVERLY RESTRICTIVE

The second phase of the legal challenge to the Communications Decency Act
began on Friday as the Department of Justice presented its defense of the
new law before the three judge panel in Philadelphia. Although basic
outline of the government's defense has been known for some time, Friday
marked the first time that the Government has presented witnesses in
defense of the CDA.

Based on Friday's testimony, the basis of the government's defense appears
to be that sexually explicit material is easily available to minors on the
Internet, and that the CDA, combined with a system for labeling sexually
explicit material, is necessary to prevent minors from accessing sexually
explicit material online.

Three witnesses testified at the Friday hearing:

* Howard Schmidt, Special Agent, Director of the Air Force Office of
  Special Investigations, Computer Crime Investigations, and

* Dan Olsen, Chair of the Brigham Young University Computer Science
  Department

* Albert Vezza, of MIT and the World Wide Web Consortium. (Vezza was
  called by the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition).

DOJ EXPERT CLAIMS THAT SPEAKER-BASED LABELING IS AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION

The government also called Dan Olsen, form Brigham Young University, who
testified that a content labeling system he has developed can effectively
prevent minors from accessing sexually explicit material online. Olsen
proposed that content providers who offer sexually explicit material should
include a "-L18" (for under 18) tag on their sites, and that World Wide Web
browsers should be programmed to recognize this tag and prevent minors from
accessing tagged sites.

Despite Olsen's academic affiliation and research credentials, his standing
as an expert on Internet standards setting is questionable at best. Olsen
does not sit on the Internet Engineering Task Force or any other body
charged with developing protocols for the Internet, nor does he have any
other direct experience with the Internet standards process.  This fact was
challenged by CIEC attorney's, who initially objected to Olsen's testimony.
The court overruled the objection, stating that they would hear Olsen's
testimony "for what it's worth".

Olsen, who admitted he came up with the idea for a -L18 tag only since the
government asked him to testify in this case, suggested that the burden of
preventing minors from accessing objectionable material online should fall
primarily on content providers, rather than the recipients of the material.


During cross examination by CIEC attorney Bruce Ennis and ACLU attorney
Chris Hansen, Olsen admitted that his proposal contains several critical
shortcomings.  Among these:

* The standard for what material should receive a -L18 tag is difficult
  to determine.

* Relying on speakers to label their material requires that listeners
  trust the judgment of the speaker, and limits the ability of listeners
  to make decisions based on their own personal or family values.

* The -L18 proposal contains no flexibility - it is either on or off.

* It is basically impossible for a content provider to determine who is
  an adult and to ensure that only adults have access to adult-oriented
  materials.

Ennis argued that, as a result, the only effective method to prevent minors
from accessing inappropriate material online is to rely on end users and
parents to control what material comes into their homes using parental
control technologies such as SurfWatch, CyberPatrol, AOL's Parental Control
features, PICS, etc.

Interestingly, although Olsen's proposal is conceptually similar to
KidCode, a content labeling standards proposed by Nathaniel Borenstein last
summer. Olsen stated he didn't know what KidCode was nor had he ever heard
of it.

Finally, Olsen testified that, because the government was involved in the
initial development of the Internet, he believes that the government has a
role in determining appropriate technical standards for content labeling.
This testimony was particularly striking because it in many ways represents
the worst nightmare of CDA opponents -- that the law will permit Government
will dictate technical protocols and standards for content on the Internet.
Although this remains a significant concern, CIEC and ACLU attorneys
effectively demonstrated that Olsen's proposed solution is poorly conceived
and impractical.

SURFWATCH FOILS GOVERNMENT EXPERT

Howard Schmidt conducted a live demonstration of the Internet, taking the
court on a tour of world wide web sites devoted to legal issues, a site
promoting the City of Philadelphia, and several search engines. He then
showed the court several usenet newsgroups and decoded pictures of ducks
from the alt.binaries.pictures.animals newsgroup.  Schmidt then showed the
court sites containing sexually explicit images, although no he did not
actually display any sexually explicit materials.

Schmidt's demonstration was intended to show how easily a child can access
sexually explicit materials online.  Throughout the course of the court
proceedings, the government has sought to show that minors can
inadvertently stumble upon "indecent" or "patently offensive" material in
the normal course of using the Internet, particularly through search
engines, and that parental control software such as SurfWatch and
Cyberpatrol are not effective at preventing minors from accessing such
material.

While Schmidt claimed that minors can "inadvertently" stumble upon sexually
explicit material on the Internet, the Judges appeared unconvinced and
asked several pointed questions. Judge Sloviter repeatedly asked "Can one
inadvertently come across this material?".

Schmidt's claim that minors can inadvertently access sexually explicit
material on the Internet highlights a critical issue in this case. If the
government can demonstrate that minors can easily and inadvertently receive
indecent or patently offensive material on the Internet, the gvt. can argue
that the Internet is a "pervasive medium" similar to television and radio,
and that broad content regulations like the CDA are the only way to protect
minors.

In his testimony, Schmidt cited examples of sexually explicit web sites
which were not blocked by SurfWatch.  Schmidt testified that he had found
these sites by searching for terms such as "sex" and "xxx" on popular
Internet search engines. During cross examination by CIEC attorney Ann
Kappler however, Schmidt revealed that he had run his initial searches
WITHOUT SurfWatch running.  Kappler noted that SurfWatch prevents searches
for terms like "sex" or "xxx", and that had Schmidt been running the
program when he conducted his initial search, he would have been unable to
access any of the sites he claimed SurfWatch didn't block.

In response to relentless questioning by Kappler, Schmidt reluctantly
admitted that "SurfWatch would not have allowed the [initial] search".

PICS - AN EXAMPLE OF A LESS-RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO THE CDA

In addition to the two government witnesses, the CIEC called Albert Vezza
of MIT and the World Wide Web Consortium to explain the Platform For
Internet Content Selection (PICS) to the court.

PICS is a set of protocols which will permit voluntary multiple,
independent third party rating systems to operate on the Internet and
commercial online services, as well as permit content providers to rate
their own material.  The PICS standards are being developed at MIT through
the World Wide Web Consortium with the support of most of the online
industry, including America Online, Prodigy, Netscape, Microsoft, Apple,
and others.

Vezza explained to the court that PICS, unlike Dan Olsen's "-L18" tag, will
allow for tremendous flexibility in rating content, and that many ratings
systems are possible. And, because PICS would be controlled at the user
level, parents and other users would have tremendous control over what
material they access.

Vezza also testified that PICS is far less restrictive and far more
effective at preventing children from accessing inappropriate material than
the Communications Decency Act. Vezza testified that because a substantial
amount of sexually explicit material is available on sites outside the
United states, and because PICS allows parents to utilize trusted
third-party rating systems, it is inherently more powerful and flexible
than the broad restrictions imposed by the CDA.

Vezza also pointed out that the PICS standards will allow parents to block
access to all unrated sites if they choose. As a result, Vezza said,
"children could be protected without mandating any one rating system, from
foreign sites, and from sites with indecent or patently offensive material
that has not been rated".

The Judges appeared extremely interested in Vezza's testimony, and asked
numerous questions. Judge Stewart Dalzell, who has taken a keen interest in
the case, stated for the second time since the trial began that the world
wide web has developed almost entirely because the government has stayed
out of the way.  At one point, Dalzell stated "There must be powerful
market forces driving this process". Dalzell then stated rhetorically that
he could imagine a marketing advantage for implementing PICS standards and
that providers would sell their services by saying, "come on line with us
and your kids won't see what is in Mr. Coppalino's book", referring to the
book of evidence containing sexually explicit images found online.

TESTIMONY TO RESUME MONDAY APRIL 15

Testimony will resume on Monday April 15 with Government witness Dan Olsen.
The trial is proceeding more quickly than initially expected, and it is
possible that all testimony from both sides will be concluded on Monday.
It is possible that the hearing originally scheduled for April 26 will be
canceled, and that the closing arguments, scheduled for June 6, will be
moved to up to mid-May.  CDT will post an update as more information
becomes available.

(1) GOVERNMENT TO BEGIN ITS DEFENSE OF CDA BEGINNING FRIDAY 4/12

The fight to overturn the Communications Decency Act will enter its second
phase on Friday April 12 with testimony from witnesses called by the
Government in defense of the CDA.  The government is expected to call
several witnesses (listed below) who will argue that the Communications
Decency Act is necessary and is the "least restrictive means" of protecting
children from "indecent" and "patently offensive" material on the Internet.


Although the government has given some indication of its strategy for
defending the CDA during the first three days of testimony (see CIEC Trial
Bulletin No.7, 4/1/96), over the next two days we will learn a great deal
more about the government's position.  The government is also expected to
conduct its own Internet demonstration, and is likely to try and show the
court examples of sexually explicit material available on the Internet.

Witnesses scheduled to testify on Friday April 12 and Monday April 15:

* Howard Schmidt, Supervisory Special Agent, Director of Air Force
  Office of Special Investigation, Computer Crime Investigations
  (Government Witness)

* Dan Olsen, Professor of Computer Science, Brigham Young University
  (Government Witness)

* Albert Vezza (Associate Director, MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and
  Chairman of the World Wide Web  Consortium), on behalf of the Citizens
  Internet Empowermnet Coalition. Vezza was unable to testify at the April
  1 hearing due to scheduling conflicts.

Government witnesses will be cross examined by CIEC and ACLU lawyers. CIEC
and ACLU lawyers will also have an opportunity to present rebuttal
testimony during a hearing scheduled for April 26, and again in closing
arguments scheduled for June 3.

OVERVIEW OF EXPECTED TESTIMONY FOR APRIL 12 AND 15

Albert Vezza, the last witness to be called on behalf of the plaintiffs,
will explain to the court how PICS works and why it offers parents the
ability to protect children from unwanted material in a less restrictive
means than the CDA.

Howard Schmidt is expected to conduct a live Internet Demonstration in
which he will show the court some of the 'good' material on the Internet,
as well as some of the sexually-explicit material available to minors.

Dan Olsen is expected to testify that the PICS standards (which enable
multiple, third party labeling and content selection) are too cumbersome
and will not be effective.  Based on his declaration, Olsen will instead
propose his own system under which content providers would tag material
with a code (-L18) indicating that the material is not appropriate for
those under 18.

The government is expected to argue that such a content labeling system
would be an appropriate "good faith defense" to prosecution under the CDA.
Interestingly, it is not clear from the language of the CDA that such
system would constitute a "good faith defense" to prosecution, or what
material would require a tag. These issues will be raised by CIEC and ACLU
attorneys during cross examination.

SCHEDULE FOR REMAINDER OF THE TRIAL

April 12 - 15   Government Witnesses (and final CIEC witness)
April 26        Plaintiff's Rebuttal Testimony
May   13        Post-hearing briefs and proposed findings of law and
                fact from both sides will be filed
June 3          Closing Arguments (each side is given 2 hours)

CDT will post a summary of Friday's testimony shortly after the testimony
concludes for the day (and after we travel back down to Washington DC).

(1) EVENING UPDATE - RECAP OF FINAL DAY OF CIEC/ACLU TESTIMONY

Testimony in the battle to overturn the Communications Decency Act resumed
Monday (4/1) before a three judge panel in the Philadelphia federal court.
Witnesses for the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition and the ACLU gave
the court an overview of the availability of parental controls on
Commercial Online Services and the further illustrated the concerns of
commercial and non commercial content providers that the CDA threatens the
free flow of information and the free exchange of ideas online.

Witnesses testifying today included:

- Bill Burrington, Director of Public Policy for America Online (CIEC)
- Andrew Anker, CEO of HotWired Ventures Ltd. (CIEC)
- Barry Steinhardt, Associate Director, National ACLU (ACLU)
- Howard Rheingold, Author (ACLU)
- Stephen Donaldson, President of Stop Prisoner Rape (ACLU)

A summary of the testimony is included below.

Monday was the third and final day of testimony from Citizens Internet
Empowerment Coalition (CIEC) and ACLU witnesses. Testimony resumes on April
12 and 15 when the Justice Department will call witnesses to defend the
constitutionality of the CDA. CIEC and ACLU lawyers will have an
opportunity to rebut the DOJ testimony during a final session scheduled for
April 26.

HOW IS THE CIEC CASE FAIRING?

The first three days of testimony have established a solid record for the
basis of the legal challenge. The CIEC legal challenge to the CDA is based
on two arguments:

* The Internet is a unique communications technology, different from
  traditional broadcast mass-media, and

* The content regulations imposed by the CDA are not the "least
  restrictive means" of protecting children online, and is therefor
  unconstitutional.

The court has heard testimony from Internet businesses, access providers,
and Libraries, and commercial and non commercial content providers
describing the nature of the Internet and how it functions (including a
live demonstration of the Net and parental control technologies), as well
as numerous examples of constitutionally protected materials which would be
prohibited under the CDA.  The Judges, while giving little indication of
their positions, are asking numerous questions and appear to have taken a
keen interest in the Internet.

DOJ: DON'T WORRY, THE BILL AINT THAT BAD...

After 3 days of hearings and cross examination by Justice Department
attorneys, a picture of the government's strategy for defending the CDA is
beginning to emerge. Although we will learn much more when testimony
resumes on April 12, the government appears to be arguing that CDA will
restrict only the most extreme sexually explicit material, and that the
defenses to prosecution are broad and do not place undue burdens on content
providers. In other words, the terms "indecent" and "patently offensive"
should be construed narrowly, and the defenses construed broadly.

Under this argument, the government appears to be overlooking several
fundamental aspects of past indecency cases and the actual language of the
CDA.  In past indecency cases, including the Pacifica case which the
authors of the CDA cite as precedent for the legislation, the term
"indecent" has been read very broadly to prohibit material even if it has
redeeming social, literary, educational, or scientific value. In addition,
during the debate on the CDA, Congress explicitly rejected the "harmful to
minors" standard, which includes a test for redeeming value.

The government also appears to be arguing for a broad interpretation of the
CDA's defenses.  The defenses available under the CDA provide immunity for
content provides who take "good faith, reasonable steps", including adult
access codes or credit card verification, to restrict minors access to
"indecent" material.  Throughout the course of the testimony, the DOJ has
asked questions of witnesses implying that implementing PICS standards or
other HTML tags would be relatively easy for content providers, suggesting
that they believe content labeling would be a "good faith" defense under
the CDA.  Here again however, it is important to note that the House/Senate
Conference committee rejected parts of the White amendment which would have
created a more explicit defense for content labeling.

FOR MORE INFORMATION

CDT will continue to provide updates on the case when testimony resumes on
April 12.  In addition, transcripts of the first 3 days of testimony will
be available on CDT's web page later this week. Please continue to visit

(2) SUMMARY OF TODAY'S TESTIMONY

Bill Burrington, Director of Public Policy for America Online, told the
Court that while AOL can and does exert some control over content on its on
network, it is impossible for service providers to control content on the
global Internet.  Testifying both on behalf of AOL as well as the entire
commercial online services industry (including Compuserve, Prodigy,
Microsoft Network, etc.), Burrington stated that while some online material
may be inappropriate for children, "... effective protection of children
from exposure to inappropriate material can only occur at the level of
individual users".

Burrington outlined the various parental control measures available on
commercial online services.  On America Online, parents have the ability to
restrict their children's access to Usenet newsgroups, binary downloads,
chat rooms, and other features of the service. He also argued that the
"indecency" restrictions imposed by the CDA will effectively ban
constitutionally protected speech for adults and reduce online-speech to
information and discourse only appropriate for children.  Burrington argued
that fear of criminal liability under the CDA could motivate AOL to remove
health related information, online forums, and other content from the
service.

HotWired CEO Andrew Anker testified that some of the material available on
HotWired, including a recent stories on the poet Allen Ginsburg and the
atl.sex.bondage newsgroup could be considered "indecent", but that it would
be impossible and extremely expensive for the company to verify the age of
every visitor to the site. In response to a question from the Justice
Department, Anker stated, "I don't understand what indecent and patently
offensive mean, or what community's standards apply".  As a result, Anker
stated, HotWired fears criminal liability under the Communications Decency
Act.

Stephen Donaldson of Stop Prisoner Rape, a group dedicated to educating the
public about prison rape and helping victims recover, testified that
because some of the content on his World Wide Web site uses sometimes
explicit images and "street language" to describe prison conditions, he
fears criminal liability under the CDA.

Similarly, Barry Steinhardt of the ACLU testified that some of the material
on the ACLU's web site, including the '7-dirty words' in the text of the
Pacifica Decision, and because the ACLU hosts chat sessions on America
Online, the ACLU could face huge fines and prison terms unless it censors
itself and its members. When asked if he felt that the text of the bible or
Shakespeare's Hamlet could be considered "indecent" under the CDA,
Steinhardt argued that community standards vary throughout the United
States and that in some places, "That kind of material ... has been the
subject of censorship" in parts of the US, and "there are many people who
regard that material as Indecent."

Howard Rheingold, author and expert on the subject of Cyberspace
Communities, described some of the many benefits the online world can bring
to education and a sense of community.  Rheingold argued that, although it
is technically possible to restrict minor's access to MUDs and MUSEs, it is
difficult to determine what material should be would be illegal under the
CDA.

Live from the Courtroom in Philadelphia...

MORE ON INTERNET BASICS, ABILITY TO CONTROL CONTENT, AND DIFFICULTIES OF
COMPLYING WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT

The Court began the second day of testimony in the hearing on the
constitutionality of the CDA with a presentation from Donna Hoffman of
Vanderbilt University. Hoffman appeared as an expert on the use of the
Internet for marketing and the nature of cyberspace. The Court also heard
from Robert Croneberger, Director of the Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh PA.

Hoffman described for the Court the vast amount of information available
online and the difficulty of individual content providers to control who
accesses particular materials. Hoffman also testified that although there
is adult oriented material available on the Internet, the actual amount of
such material as a percentage of what is available on the Net is extremely
small.  In response to a question form Judge Dalzel, Hoffman described the
Internet as the most democratic communications medium in the world, and the
most important communications technology developed since the printing
press.

Throughout their questioning of Hoffman, the Justice Department attorneys
appeared to be arguing that the Internet, more than any other
communications technology, provides children a unique ability to access
sexually explicit materials.  Justice Department attorneys showed an
example of a search conduced on "InfoSeek" (a popular web-directory) for
the book title "Little Women", which they hypothesized a minor might
conduct for a school project.  The DOJ attorney offered into evidence a
list of links generated from a search for "Little Women", which included a
link to a site titled "See Hot Pictures of Naked Women!"

The Justice Department also pointed to a site known as "Bianca's Smut
Shack", which has placed a notice on the site warning minors not to enter
and suggesting ways parents can block access to the site.  The DOJ was
apparently trying to illustrate that the CDA had resulted in the removal of
some adult materials and has led others to take "good faith, reasonable
steps" to prevent minors from accessing the site.

Hoffman emphasized that the only effective means of ensuring that minors do
not access inappropriate material is to rely on end users and parents. In a
response to a question posed by Chris Hansen, an ACLU attorney, Hoffman
noted that all three of the options suggested by the Bianca site each
require individual user control, and that the content provider cannot
ensure that no one under 18 accesses the site. This exchange will be
important in showing that the only effective means of preventing children
from accessing objectionable or inappropriate material online is to rely on
individual users and parents to make content decisions themselves.

LIBRARIAN SAYS COMPLYING WITH CDA IS IMPOSSIBLE

The next witness to testify, called on behalf of the CIEC, was Robert
Croneberger, Director of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.  Croneberger
testified that the Carnegie Library maintains an extensive online card
catalogue with over 2 million entries, as well as online archives
containing he full texts of many magazines and journals.

Croneberger stated that the scope of the indecency standard imposed by the
CDA threatens the ability of Libraries to place a great deal of material
online, including card catalogues and the texts of Shakespeare plays.
Croneberger also stated that it is both technically and economically
impossible for his library to search through their entire catalogue to
identify and label particular entries in order to ensure that they are not
accessible to minors.

For their part, the Justice Department attempted to show that searching the
Carnegie Library's 2 million entry catalogue by keywords such as "sex"
would narrow the search to a manageable level, and would thus be realistic
to accomplish.  Croneberger responded by noting that the word "sex" might
appear in books ranging from a biography of President Lincoln, to biology
texts to travel guides. Croneberger stated that even if it were technically
possible and economically reasonable to label the library's entire online
collection, it would be extremely difficult to do so because the
definitions of "indecent" and "patently offensive" are can be interpreted
so broadly.

Croneberger stated that Libraries should not be responsible for labeling
and blocking access to certain materials.  Such a requirement would be
inconsistent with the mission of a library, Croneberger stated. However,
Croneberger stressed the benefits of empowering parents to control their
children's access to material online, just as parents do in the real world.
During one point of his testimony, Croneberger said, "If we as libraries
are put in a position of making decisions for other people's children, we
would fail miserably."  He then went on to say that he wished his library
could afford to provide copies of SurfWatch and other parental control
applications to loan out to parents.

JUDGES CONTINUE TO EXPRESS A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST IN THE NET

As they did during yesterday's testimony and Internet demonstration,
the three judges asked a number of questions of both witnesses this
morning.  All three appear extremely interested in the workings of the
Internet, particularly the World Wide Web and the ability to easily jump
from one part of the world to another.  The judges also appear interested
in the questions raised about the definitions of the terms "indecent" and
"patently offensive", although they have given no indication of how they
will come out on this question.

Testimony resumes with Scott Bradner of Harvard and the IETF at 1:30 ET.
Court is expected to adjourn at 3:30 ET today and resume at 9:30 am on
Monday April 1.  Situation permitting we will provide an evening update on
the second part of today's proceedings.

(1) EVENING UPDATE - SURFING THE NET FROM THE COURTROOM

The Court has recessed for the day after a long day of education on the
nature of the Internet, the effectiveness of parental control software, and
testimony on the potential impact of the Communications Decency Act on
small, independent content providers.  Testimony resumes at 9:30 am ET
Friday March 22.

After hearing about the workings of the Internet from Scott Bradner of the
IETF this morning (see CIEC Afternoon Edition 3/21), the Court was given a
visual demonstration of the World Wide Web by SurfWatch's Ann Duvall. After
briefly describing the Internet and the basic steps one must take to get
online (including purchasing a computer and modem, and subscribing to an
Internet Service Provider or Online Service), Duvall logged on and took the
Court on a trip around the Net. Duvall visited a site sponsored by the City
of Philadelphia (the setting of the trial) and checked the schedule for
upcoming Phillies games, then jumped to London for a quick tour of a Museum
before returning to the United States for a demonstration of Yahoo's new
site for Kids (yahooligans). She also showed the court how her daughter had
found information on Fragile X syndrome for a research paper.

Duvall then illustrated the effectiveness of SurfWatch, and parental
control technology generally, by attempting to access several adult
oriented sites (including Penthouse Magazine) with SurfWatch engaged.  She
also illustrated how SurfWatch blocks attempts to search for terms like
"sexy" and "erotica" using common search engines. Each attempt was greated
with a "blocked by SurfWatch" message.

Despite expectations that the Justice Department might attempt to use the
Internet demonstration to show that some sexually explicit Internet sites
may not be blocked by SurfWatch, the DOJ attorneys did not do so, and
offered no examples of sexually explicit sites to the Court. Instead, they
concentrated their efforts on the number of sites SurfWatch blocks
(approximately 5000, plus key words like "sex") in an apparent attempt to
show that there is are a large number of such sites on the Net. They also
suggested SurfWatch may not be effective because sites on the Internet
change frequently and new sites regularly come on line.

The Judges appeared extremely interested in Duvall's testimony, and asked a
number of questions.  They seemed particularly taken with the demonstration
of the World Wide Web and the variety of information available. In an
important question wich may help to illustrate the potential weeknesses of
the CDA, Judge Dalzel focused on Duvall's statement that approximately 30%
of the sites SurfWatch blocks are outside the United States.

SMALL, INDEPENDENT CONTENT PROVIDERS WILL SUFFER UNDER THE CDA

The Court next heard from Kiyoshi Kuromiya, Director of the Critical Path
AIDS Project. Kuroimya, called by the ACLU attorneys, testified that he
maintains a World Wide Web site which contains information on how to avoid
the AIDS virus and other sexually transmitted diseases. Kuromiya stated
that some of the materials on his site use explicit terms which may
violated the "indecency" and "patently offensive" provisions of the CDA.
In response to a question from Judge Dalzel, Kuromiya stated that he would
not want to alter the materials he posts, or deny access to the site, in
order to avoid prosecution under the CDA.

The Court also heard form Patricia Warren  an author and publisher who
maintains a Web site containing excerpts from her books, some of which deal
with Gay and Lesbian subject matter.  Warren stated that she fears
prosecution under the CDA because some in the United States consider the
subject matter she addresses to be 'indecent'.  During her testimony, one
of the Judges, apparently understanding the vast potential of the Internet
to make every user a publisher, asked if it is easier to publish a magazine
online than in printed form. Warren responded by suggesting that because
distribution and production costs are significantly lower on the Net,
publishing online is an important outlet for small publishers with limited
resources.

Neither Kuromiya or Warren were cross examined by the Justice Department.

Testimony resumes tomorrow with Scott Bradner, who had to leave early
today. Witnesses expected to testify also include Donna Hoffman, of
Vanderbeldt University.  Situation permitting, we will post a summary of
tomorrow's testimony starting in the afternoon. Please continue to check
the CIEC web page for updates (http://www.cdt.org/ciec/)

Live from the courtroom in Philadelphia...

INTERNET 101 -- WHAT IS THE NET AND HOW DOES IT WORK?

The Court has just taken a recess for lunch. This morning, the Court heard
testimony from Scott Bradner (of Harvard University and the IETF), who was
called on behalf of the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition. Bradner,
who answered questions posed by the Justice Department, gave the court a 3
hour overview of the nature of the Internet and how it functions.

Bradner gave a detailed overview of the Internet standards setting
processes, and then described the various functions available online,
including the World Wide Web, Usenet Newsgroups, ftp, telnet, and
electronic mail. Throughout his testimony, Bradner illustrated to the court
that the Internet is a vast, decentralized global network containing
information on a huge variety of subjects, from Newsgroups on Formula One
auto-racing to the catalogues of the Harvard Library.

When outlining the various ways users can access information on the
Internet, Bradner stressed that users have tremendous control over the
material they access.  Bradner's testimony illustrated to the court that if
a user wants to access information on a particular subject, they must seek
out that information and affirmatively request it before any information is
provided.  The Government did not attempt to refute this claim, nor did
they present any evidence to the contrary.

The 3 judges were actively involved in this morning's testimony, and asked
many questions which indicated that, despite the flurry of acronyms and
technical details Bradner presented, they understand the basic nature of
the Internet as presented today.

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE CASE?

While it is obviously still far too early to draw any conclusions about the
outcome of this case, this morning's testimony was an important first step
in showing the court that the Internet is a unique communications
technology distinct from mass media such as Radio and TV. As you know, this
argument is a critical piece of the CIEC challenge. Bradner's testimony
showed that, while the Internet is ubiquitous network accessible from
virtually anywhere, it is not, as the Justice Department seeks to show,
"pervasive" in the same way as traditional mass media.

Testimony will resume at 1:30 pm with Ann Duvall, President of SurfWatch
Software (and another CIEC witness). Using the Net.connection installed in
the court, Ann will demonstrate the World Wide Web and illustrate how
SurfWatch functions.  Scott Bradner will return tomorrow (Friday 3/22)
morning for follow-up questions by CIEC attorneys.

Situation permitting, we will post an update later today on the afternoon
testimony.

This message is being posted directly from the courtroom in a Philadelphia
Federal Court where, in just a few hours, a historic legal battle will
begin. Over the next several weeks, the court will consider the
constitutionality of the Communications Decency Act. In the process, the
fate of the Internet and the future of freedom of expression in the
Information Age will be on trial.

In order to keep you as informed as possible on the proceedings before the
court, CDT will publish periodic updates. This, the first of those updates,
outlines the testimony presented by CIEC witnesses in written declarations
filed on March 1, 1996. Several of these witnesses will be appearing live
before the court in the coming weeks.

Later today, we will post a summary of today's court proceedings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Excerpts of Declarations from Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition
    Witnesses

The following are excerpts from declarations filed in the constitutional
challenge to the Communications Decency Act.  These declarations, among a
total of 37 filed, represent the factual basis of the case against the
Communications Decency Act.

INADEQUATE CONSIDERATION BY CONGRESS

"I am a United States Senator representing the State of Vermont....  [I]
have been personally involved in the congressional debate over the
government's role in controlling content on the Internet.  During the year
of consideration of the Communications Decency Act (CDA), there were no
congressional hearings held on the legislation and no congressional
findings were made as to its necessity or the lack of less restrictive
alternatives."  (Sen. Leahy (D-VT) Paragraph1,2)

USE OF THE INTERNET IN SUPPORT OF DEMOCRACY

"Periodically, I hold electronic town meetings in which a number of
Vermonters at different sites in Vermont ask me questions and discuss
issues online.  Participants in these town meetings have included college
students and may have included, or will in the future include, minors.  I
have no control over the language used by the participants to express
themselves during these electronic town meetings than I would at a town
meeting where we were all physically present in one location."  (Sen. Leahy
(D-VT) Paragraph5)

WEBSITE OPERATORS CANNOT RESTRICT ACCESS BY MINORS

"It is not technically or economically feasible for HotWired to pre-screen
subscribers in order to determine whether they are minors.  Subscribers
apply for membership to HotWired through the Internet by providing their
names and e-mail addresses.  Accordingly, HotWired does not know their
ages.  Even if subscribers were asked to state their ages, there is no way
to determine the truth of their assertions." (Wolf, HotWired Online
Magazine, Paragraph6)

NO CENTRALIZED CONTROL OF THE WEB

"Running on tens of thousands of individual computers on the Internet, the
World Wide Web is what is known as a distributed system.  The Web was
designed to that organizations with computers containing information can
become part of the Web simply by attaching their computers to the Internet
and running appropriate World Wide Web software.  No single organization
controls any membership in the Web, nor is there any centralized point from
which individual web sites or services can be blocked from the Web.  From a
user's perspective, it may appear to be a single, integrated system, but in
reality it has no centralized control point.  (Berners-Lee, World Wide Web
Consortium, Paragraph11)

NO MEANS TO CHECK AGE ON THE WEB

"At present, I am not aware of any methods in the technical standards that
make up the World Wide Web which would enable a Web site operator or
publisher to establish the age of a user attempting to access a Web site.
Establishing age through credit card verification is burdensome for all Web
site operators and not practical for those Web sites which do not otherwise
have a commercial relationship with their users.  I believe that
non-commercial Web sites would be forced to shut down if required to check
the ages of their users through credit card verification. Even commercial
sites will face significant burden if credit card verification is required
before all user access. The cost of each verification by a credit card
clearinghouse is , I understand, between $1 and $2. Sites which are
accessed thousands or millions of times per day, will certainly face
significant cost if such age verification is required. (Berners-Lee, World
Wide Web Consortium, Paragraph16)

CONTROLING ACCESS TO CONTENT ONLY POSSIBLE BY USERS, NOT CONTENT PROVIDERS

"...for many important methods of communication on the Internet, the
senders -- the content providers -- have no ability to ensure that their
messages are only available to adults.  It is not possible for an Internet
service provider or large institutional provider of access to the Internet
(such as a university) to screen out all or even most content that could be
deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" (to the extent that those terms
can be understood at all.) (Bradner, Internet Engineering Task Force,
Paragraph10)

SCREENING REQUIRED BY THE ACT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE INTERNET 
SERVICE PROVIDERS

"Individual posters of newsgroup postings have no way to monitor or control
who views their postings....  Screening at the server level would require
millions of individual check of messages each day.  Moreover, many of these
millions of checks would require legally informed human inspection to
assess whether a given message, particularly on containing a graphic image,
was 'indecent' or 'patently offensive'.  Such a screening process would be
enormously expensive, and if required would almost certainly reduce the
viability and usefulness of newsgroups as a means of communication."
(Collet, Commercial Internet Exchange, Paragraph10,11)

MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS TO CONTROL CONTENT IS FROM THE USER END

"Based on my experience and knowledge of the Internet, I believe that the
most effective way to monitor, screen, or control the full range of
information transmitted over the Internet is to block undesired content at
the client end -- that is, by using software installed in the individual
user's computer." (Bradner, Internet Engineering Task Force, Paragraph11)

ONLINE SERVICES ALLOW PARENTS TO CONTROL THEIR KIDS ACCESS TO
INAPPROPRIATE MATERIAL

"Parental controls [available on America Online] enable parents to restrict
access to Internet newsgroups.  The parental control provided by AOL, when
activated by a parent, can 1) block access to all newsgroups, 2) block
access to a specific newsgroups by entering a specific Internet address, 3)
block access to all Internet newsgroups not listed in the AOL index, 4)
block access to newsgroups that have binary downloads, name photographs and
sound recordings, and 5) restrict access to newsgroups that contain a
particular string of characters, such as "sex" or "nudity" in their
Internet addresses." (Burke, America Online Paragraph12)

AFFORDABLE SOFTWARE PROVIDES EFFECTIVE PROTECTION FOR KIDS ONLINE

"SurfWatch allows parents and other concerned users to exercise meaningful
choice and control over what material their children access on the
Internet.  People choose to use our product because it is a realistic
approach to Internet content filtering at a personal level.  It is not
possible for anyone, including the government, to control content on a
worldwide, decentralized communications network such as the Internet.  The
only effective way to protect children from objectionable material on the
Internet, while ensuring that adults can access material which is
otherwise protected by the First Amendment, is to empower individual users
and parents with tools necessary to block objectionable materials.
SurfWatch was developed to do just that."  (Duvall, SurfWatch Software
Paragraph30)

PICS STANDARDS PROMOTE USER CHOICE ON THE INTERNET

"The mission of the PICS working group is to give individual users control
over the content that is accessible on the Internet to themselves and their
children.  PICS aims to allow families to open their homes to the Internet
while still protecting their children from material that is inconsistent
with that family's values."  (Vezza, Platform for Internet Content
Selection, Paragraph5)

"The flexibility of the PICS labeling process allows parents to give older
children access to more material than younger children."  (Vezza, Platform
for Internet Content Selection, Paragraph10)

CDA RESTRICTS FREEDOM OF THE PRESS

"Historically, the First Amendment guarantee of "freedom of the press" has
protected newspapers from government-imposed content restrictions which,
like those in the Communications Decency Act, prohibit and punish the
dissemination of material considered "indecent" or "patently offensive as
measured by contemporary community standards."  By its terms, however, the
Act contains no exceptions for newspapers or the news media, and can be
applied to the print press in the same manner that it can be applied to any
other person, when a newspaper published in hardcopy is also published
electronically or online." (Ketter, American Society of Newspaper Editors
(ASNE), Paragraph7)

INFORMATION LEGALLY PUBLISHABLE IN PRINT IS ILLEGAL ONLINE

"With such broad and imprecise terms of restriction, ASNE members believe
that the risk of prosecution under the Act will compel editors to "play it
safe" by censoring the online editions of their daily newspapers in ways
that would be wholly unnecessary with respect to hardcopy paper editions.
Editors faced with the prospect of personal criminal and/or civil liability
for the content of online editions of their newspapers will shy away from
exercising their historical prerogative under the First Amendment to foster
public awareness, interest and debate over many of the most piquant issues
of the day."  (Ketter, American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE),
Paragraph10)

CDA WILL HARM USERS OF ONLINE SERVICES

"The Communications Decency Act of 1996 will have a direct and damaging
impact on AOL and all of its members.  It is likely that AOL will be forced
to reduce access of all users, including adults, to content currently made
available if the indecency provisions remains part of the Act.  Thus, the
Act would effectively reduce online content to a level suitable for a
child."  (Burke Paragraph6)

CDA WILL LIMIT LIBRARY COLLECTIONS ON THE NET

"Many librarians have their own World Wide Web sites on the Internet, where
librarians post their own material or offer patrons links to other World
Wide Web sites....  Patrons could thus access the Web sites of a library
anywhere in the country.... Librarians have no clear understanding of what
materials would be considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" by some
communities....  In the last ten years, members of some communities have
sought to ban works such as the Bible and the American Heritage Dictionary
from library collections on the ground that those books contain material
inappropriate for children.  It is unclear whether libraries that post such
texts or excerpts on their Web site would face criminal prosecution if a
particular community in some other part of the country found those texts to
be "indecent" or "patently offensive.""  (Krug, American Library
Association, Paragraph5,6,7)

     1                    (Whereupon the following occurred in open court at

     2           9:32 o'clock p.m.:)

     4           of persons having any matter to present before the Honorable

     7           Buckwalter and the Honorable Stewart Dalzell, Judges in the

     8           United States District Court for the Eastern District of

    10                    God save the United States and this Honorable Court. 

    11           Court is now in session, please be seated.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Good morning.

    13                    I think you should know the Court's view as to the

    14           argument today.  We deem this as for maybe I speak from the

    15           vantage point of an Appellate Judge, but we deem this for our

    16           benefit rather than for yours in that you have set forth in

    17           the comprehensive briefs and your proposed findings of fact

    18           and conclusions of law your positions.  

    19                    While, of course, you will proceed, we will

    20           interrupt you with -- I assume we will interrupt you with

    21           numerous questions, at least I know I have numerous questions

    22           after reading these.  And therefore, although we have given

    23           you time limits, those are your time limits, the Court has no

    24           time limits and therefore we, to the extent that we want

    25           clarification, we will go over those time limits, it doesn't


                    


                                                                             4

     1           reflect on either or any of the parties if we ask more

     2           questions of one party than of another or if our extensions

     3           come unequally for that purpose.

     4                    We believe that you shouldn't make plans to go by

     5           plane before lunch anywhere since it is possible that --

     6           likely that we will go beyond the lunch period, give

     7           everybody a break and then resume.  We tell you that at the

     8           outset so that you can know.

     9                    Anything else preliminarily?  Anything else

    10           preliminarily?

    11                    Okay, we will hear from counsel.

    12                    MR. HANSEN:  Good morning, your Honors.  My name is

    13           Christopher Hansen.  I'm one of the lawyers representing the

    14           ACLU plaintiffs in this case.

    15                    I'd like to begin by addressing two subjects that

    16           are not in dispute in this case that are extremely important

    17           to the plaintiff's analysis of this case.

    18                    The first is that this is a criminal statute, it's

    19           not a regulatory statute or an FCC regulation, it's a

    20           criminal statute.  It carries the penalties of fines,

    21           imprisonment and a criminal record.

    22                    Second, it is a criminal statute aimed at speech

    23           which all parties agree is constitutional and protected

    24           speech, at least for adults.

    25                    The rules of vagueness and overbreadth, which are


                    


                                                                             5

     1           the primary subjects I'm going to be addressing this morning

     2           are held to their strictest when either of these two criteria

     3           apply, either when they say the statute is a criminal statute

     4           or when it implicates First Amendment barriers, here we have

     5           both.

     6                    And thus the rules of vagueness and overbreadth in

     7           this context must be applied with particular strictness.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  On the other hand, this is a

     9           preliminary injunction request and the Supreme Court has made

    10           very clear that in preliminary injunctions the Court is not

    11           to reach out and decide the issues that are not absolutely

    12           essential at that time.  Is that not correct?

    13                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh, that's certainly correct. We think,

    14           however, it is going to be essential for you to not reach out

    15           but have to decide the issues of vagueness and overbreadth as

    16           they apply to this particular statute.

    17                    There are a couple of other features about the fact

    18           that this is a criminal statute that I would like to

    19           highlight, in addition to the fact that it carries the

    20           potential of imprisonment. 

    21                    The first is that it does require immediate

    22           compliance upon penalty of imprisonment.  Now, I cross-

    23           examined Mr. Olsen on my hypothetical, allow my clients to

    24           comply with this statute by 6:15 in the afternoon and it

    25           sounded extreme at the time because it is an incredibly tight


                    


                                                                             6

     1           schedule within which to comply with the statute. 

     2                    But the statute doesn't contain a phasing period, it

     3           doesn't contain a period of grace during which people can

     4           speak without the necessity of going to jail.  Indeed if my

     5           clients, if this Court were to uphold this statute at 6:00

     6           o'clock this afternoon, my clients would be in jeopardy for

     7           speech that they engaged in at 6:15, in jeopardy of

     8           imprisonment.

     9                    It  is also a very peculiar criminal statute in one

    10           other respect.  The statute says that the defenses change as

    11           technology changes.  Now, Mr. Ennis will primarily be

    12           addressing the offenses, but I'd like to highlight this one

    13           part of the defenses.

    14                    It is surely an odd criminal statute that behavior I

    15           engage in today is legal but tomorrow will be illegal because

    16           technology has changed between today and tomorrow.  It

    17           suggests that I have to keep track of all current technology,

    18           make sure I'm on top of the latest technology to make sure

    19           that I have defended myself against this statute.

    20                    And I think that feature highlights what is an

    21           important part --

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What provision specifically are you

    23           referring to in the statute when you say the statute says

    24           that?

    25                    MR. HANSEN:  Subsection E says it is a defense to


                    


                                                                             7

     1           engage in reasonable and effective and so on measures in

     2           order to preclude minors from having access to this, to the

     3           material.  It says reasonable and effective measures under

     4           current technology. And indeed both amici and the Government

     5           make much of the notion that technology is rapidly changing

     6           in this area and what is not possible today may become

     7           possible in the future.  Indeed I expect Mr. Ennis will spend

     8           considerable time talking about how the Government's

     9           essentially conceding that the defenses are not really much

    10           available today, instead the Government is relying on its

    11           hope the defenses will be available in the future.

    12                    But what this highlights, to me anyway, is the

    13           nature of the medium that we're talking about because even if

    14           we were talking about a criminal statute applicable to

    15           constitutionally protected speech in the context of broadcast

    16           or in other contexts, if we're -- if we're worrying about CBS

    17           having to face those kinds of problems, CBS is -- and NBC,

    18           there are a limited number of speakers in the context of

    19           television and they have batteries of lawyers and they have

    20           batteries of people who review programs before they go on the

    21           air.

    22                    In this case we're talking about the most democratic

    23           means of speech yet devised.  It is an area of a medium where

    24           all of us can be both speakers and listeners, where entry

    25           into the marketplace of ideas is simple, is relatively


                    


                                                                             8

     1           inexpensive and it makes all of us as powerful as CBS news.

     2                    My Webpage can be seen by just as many people as CBS

     3           News' Webpage.  In that context it is difficult -- we have to

     4           remember we are then calling upon every single American to be

     5           able to define the exact parameters of vague--of the statute

     6           here, the exact parameters of indecency, the exact parameters

     7           of patent defensiveness.

     8                    Every single American may, as Mr. Olsen suggested,

     9           have to hire their own lawyer to determine what the precise

    10           contours of those phrases are.

    11                    It is because of the evolving and democratic nature

    12           of this medium that the use of the criminal statute in this

    13           context is a particularly onerous method of dealing with the

    14           problem here.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What is the problem?

    16                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, Congress perceives the problem to

    17           be that minors are obtaining access to material that are

    18           inappropriate for minors to be obtaining access to.  In our

    19           view, Congress has not made out evidence that that problem

    20           does exist.  In the examples, for example, and Mr. Schmidt

    21           provided us with a lot of examples of the kind of speech that

    22           the Government asserts is at issue here.  Much of that

    23           speech, in our view, would be encompassed within already

    24           existing criminal prohibitions of either obscenity or child

    25           pornography.  Indeed --


                    


                                                                             9

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Which I take it everybody agrees is

     2           entitled to absolutely no protection, obscenity and child

     3           pornography, that's established, correct? 

     4                    MR. HANSEN:  I think the Supreme Court has been

     5           crystal clear that that is established,  that's correct.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

     7                    MR. HANSEN:  And indeed Senator Exon, the sponsor of

     8           this statute, waved around, and indeed I think successfully

     9           waved around on the floor of the Senate what he called the

    10           Blue Book.  And the Blue Book consisted of pictures even more

    11           extreme than those you saw in the Coppolino book during the

    12           testimony stage, pictures that under any -- I think under

    13           most people's definition would be considered obscene.

    14                    But we're not talking about obscene speech here. 

    15           None of the plaintiffs is challenging prohibitions against

    16           obscene speech or against child pornography, we're talking

    17           about something that is outside the definition of what

    18           obscene speech is.

    19                    And the -- the issue of whether the two phrases,

    20           indecency and patent offensiveness, are either vague or

    21           overbroad.  It turns out after a careful reading of the

    22           Government's brief and the amici in support of the Government

    23           to be a fascinating case.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do you understand the two phrases

    25           to be different or the same?


                    


                                                                            10

     1                    MR. HANSEN:  I understand the Government to be

     2           arguing that the two phrases are the same.  I don't think

     3           that argument necessarily makes sense.  I mean we -- the

     4           normal rule of statutory construction is that when  the

     5           Congress uses two different clauses or words, it means to

     6           convey two different concepts.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:   Yeah, but when the conference

     8           report specifically references Pacifica and Sable as the

     9           source of meaning for those, doesn't the Government have the

    10           better of the argument?  Well, I'm not deciding the

    11           consequences of this but as a matter of statutory

    12           construction that the terms "indecent" and "patently

    13           offensive" are interchangeable?

    14                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, there's no question that the FCC

    15           has defined -- has defined indecency using some of the patent

    16           offensiveness clause that is contained in the Communications

    17           Decency Act.

    18                    There are slightly different wrinkles.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right, and your point is that if

    20           they'd had the better of the argument if that case was

    21           applicable to this situation, I suppose.

    22                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, that's -- that's absolutely true.

    23           And they'd have the better of the argument if this medium

    24           were identical to the broadcast medium.  The Government also

    25           says that indecency and patent offensiveness mean different


                    


                                                                            11

     1           things in different media.  And so I'm not sure we can easily

     2           borrow from the other media.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But don't we run into trouble since

     4           the patently offensive locution comes verbatim out of Supreme

     5           Court cases, wouldn't it be a bit of a leap for the three of

     6           us who at last report are not on the Supreme Court to say oh,

     7           that's unconstitutionally vague?

     8                    MR. HANSEN:  No, I don't think it would be a leap at

     9           all.  I don't think the Supreme Court has ever found that

    10           that phrase -- either of the two phrases at issue in this

    11           case are not vague.  The closest the Supreme Court has come

    12           to commenting, if you will, on the vagueness of the patent

    13           offensiveness phrases is Pacifica, the seven dirty words

    14           George Carlin monologue case.

    15                    The Court in that case specifically does not reach

    16           the vagueness question, instead all they say is that in the

    17           context of this monologue, this monologue is punishable.  We

    18           agree that it is legitimate for the FCC to regulate this

    19           monologue, to make it go at three in the morning instead of

    20           three in the afternoon.  They don't reach the question of

    21           whether the FCC's definition of either indecency or patent

    22           offensiveness was unconstitutionally vague.

    23                    In addition to that, as I was suggesting a minute

    24           ago, we have some evidence from the Government in this case

    25           that the definition of indecency and patent offensiveness in


                    


                                                                            12

     1           the medium of cyberspace is different than its meaning in

     2           broadcasting.  I don't -- I'm not sure I can understand --

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But that's not the Government.  What

     4           we have to look at, I mean how Mr. Coppolino and his

     5           colleagues interpret it is one thing, what we have to

     6           interpret as a law that Congress adopted and with all

     7           deference to Justice Scalia's views of statutory

     8           construction, you know, if we look at the conference report,

     9           et cetera, that's what we look at to find a meaning, not the

    10           Government's brief, isn't it?

    11                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh, I think that's -- I think that's

    12           exact.  I think first, with deference to Justice Scalia, I

    13           think you first look at the language of the statute, but I

    14           think the conference report -- I agree with your Honor, the

    15           conference report provides useful information in helping to

    16           interpret the language of the statute.

    17                    But I think there's one other thing that can be said

    18           about the depth -- the vagueness or lack of vagueness of the

    19           definition of indecency or patent offensiveness, either one,

    20           and that is I think we've come a long way since the Pacifica

    21           decision in terms of finding out whether we can accurately

    22           define what indecency means.

    23                    And this case, and the repeated citation to the FCC

    24           definitions of indecency I think is the most vivid example

    25           that whatever we were predicting in Pacifica we were going to


                    


                                                                            13

     1           be able to do, that is narrowly and tightly or precisely

     2           define vagueness, we've now learned we can't do it.  And this

     3           case provides any number of examples of why that's the case.

     4                    For example, the -- as the Court is aware, the

     5           obscenity test, the Miller test, includes patent

     6           offensiveness as well, but it also includes the element that

     7           the speech be prurient and it also includes the element that

     8           the speech have no serious value.

     9                    Well, in this case the Government hints at the

    10           notion that those concepts are somehow embedded in our

    11           definition of either indecency or patent offensiveness.  They

    12           don't ever explicitly say that and in fact at some points

    13           they seem to back away from it, but they certainly hint at

    14           it.

    15                    The FCC has found that prurience is not a necessary

    16           part of either indecency or patent offensiveness.  Indeed the

    17           George Carlin monologue itself, it's hard to see how anyone

    18           could find it prurient.  You might find it humorous or you

    19           might find it unhumorous, there are a lot of things you might

    20           say about it, but it's hard to see how anyone would be turned

    21           on by the George Carlin monologue.

    22                    So if we're in fact looking to the FCC or looking to

    23           prior cases as to what indecency  means, I think we have to

    24           reject the Government's notion to suggest that somehow this

    25           case is about prurience.  What --


                    


                                                                            14

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But both sides have cited a lot of

     2           FCC decisions, very helpfully.  One that I thought was rather

     3           interesting that I take it neither your organization nor the

     4           party involved thought to take to the Supreme Court was this

     5           very interesting case, Merrill Hansen, spelled the same way

     6           as your surname.  I don't know, any relation?

     7                    MR. HANSEN:  No relation, no relation, your Honor.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Where the two -- where the

     9           two disc-jockeys were talking about the Playboy article

    10           involving the alleged rape by Jim Baker of Jessica Hahn and

    11           even though the Commission agreed that it was newsworthy and

    12           I must say, reading the transcript myself, it seemed to me

    13           that the disc-jockeys who may have started out thinking they

    14           were going to make a joke of it, and when they found out at

    15           least in their view that Ms. Hahn really was raped.  And they

    16           said hey, this is really serious, this is bad stuff.  Okay?

    17                    Sounds to me like pretty constitutionally protected

    18           discussion of a public figure and the Commission says,

    19           acknowledging that it was newsworthy at the time, that the

    20           merit of the work is simply one of many variables and held

    21           that it was appropriate to fine them a forfeiture of $2,000

    22           for that.

    23                    Now, nobody said, nobody said a  constitutional boo

    24           to that decision, did they?

    25                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, somebody should have.  But as far


                    


                                                                            15

     1           as I know, no one did.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But after Pacifica, could you say

     3           boo?

     4                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh, I think absolutely could.  I think

     5           that is the -- that case is one of the most perfect examples

     6           of how we have now learned that the effort we started, the

     7           road we started down in Pacifica to define indecency isn't

     8           working.  I mean, the Government in this case suggests that

     9           there's some sort of serious value component to patent

    10           offensiveness and indecency.  But then, as your Honor quite

    11           properly suggests, the FCC rejects the notion that there's a

    12           serious value component.

    13                    And if we put back into indecency or patent

    14           offensiveness prurience and serious value, we've recreated

    15           the definition of obscenity.  We then no longer need the

    16           concept of indecency.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But if you're right, wouldn't we

    18           have heard some echo in Sable, for example, some quibbling in

    19           Sable?  I mean I agree with you that Pacifica has been

    20           narrowed over time, but notably it hasn't been narrowed on

    21           the indecency point.  Wouldn't you agree with that?

    22                    MR. HANSEN:  No, I'm not sure I would agree.  I

    23           think there has continued to be ferment in the --

    24           particularly in the lower courts at least about the question

    25           of whether these, these clauses can be properly defined and


                    


                                                                            16

     1           whether they are vague or overbroad.

     2                    For example, in Alliance, which was argued recently,

     3           one of the issues lurking in Alliance -- it may not be

     4           reached by the Supreme Court because the Supreme Court's

     5           dealing with --

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I know, we talked about that though

     7           and I think we've all reviewed the transcript and the word

     8           indecency didn't even come up.  

     9                    MR. HANSEN:  No, but --

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So we shouldn't hold our breath for

    11           that decision, should we?

    12                    MR. HANSEN:  No, and I don't think the Supreme

    13           Court, I suspect the Supreme Court won't give us guidance on

    14           that in that case, but my point is that the issue of whether

    15           the concept of indecency or patent offensiveness is

    16           unconstitutionally vague remains in ferment.  We in fact cite

    17           some lower court cases that in some context have found that

    18           those kinds of clauses are in fact unconstitutionally vague.

    19                    It is fair to say that some, there are courts that

    20           have said that given Pacifica we are going to say that that

    21           issue is foreclosed, but we think it's by no means.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  In a criminal context?

    23                    MR. HANSEN:  No, and indeed --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Has there been any criminal case

    25           that has sustained, that you know of, let's say any Federal


                    


                                                                            17

     1           criminal case that has sustained the use of indecency?

     2                    MR. HANSEN:  No.  We looked very hard for it.  As

     3           far as I can determine there is only one other place where

     4           indecency or patent offensiveness, there are two, where

     5           they're a crime as opposed to some sort of regulation,

     6           broadcast and the Dial-A-Porn context, we looked very hard to

     7           see if any in the last 20 or 50 years anyone had ever been

     8           either charged or convicted of indecency in any of those

     9           contexts.  We were unable to find a single example.

    10                    We found a couple of cases in which people have been

    11           prosecuted for a statute that said you may not engage in

    12           obscene or indecent speech, the case seemed to go -- the case

    13           explicitly went off purely on the obscenity issue, but we

    14           found no example of a crime.

    15                    And indeed in Pacifica the Court suggested that the

    16           reason they were able to reach out and find the Carlin

    17           monologue on acceptably -- acceptable to channel it to some

    18           other part of the day, one of the reasons they were able to

    19           do that was because it was a regulatory context and not a

    20           criminal context.  They explicitly suggested that they might

    21           have reached a different result.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, this is your vagueness

    23           argument --

    24                    MR. HANSEN:  Correct.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- that you're in.  Okay.  You're


                    


                                                                            18

     1           going to get to your First Amendment -- I mean to your over-

     2           breadth argument?

     3                    MR. HANSEN:  Absolutely, although I think they --

     4           yes, absolutely.  Although I think they are -- it's difficult

     5           to pull them apart.  It's certainly analytically possible to

     6           pull them apart.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's easy to do that, isn't it?

     8                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, but --

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You have different constitutional

    10           provisions.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes.

    12                    MR. HANSEN:  But the facts that are sort of relevant

    13           to them are identical.  For example, if you assume that

    14           prurience is no longer part of the definitions here or -- and

    15           if you assume that this act, these two phrases do include

    16           material of serious value, then I think it presents you

    17           right, flat out the issue of whether we now have an over-

    18           breadth problem, that is whether we are now reaching speech

    19           that is constitutionally protected for adults that has

    20           serious value, that although it is about sex is not about

    21           prurience.  

    22                    I think that -- I think we're flatly presented with

    23           the question of whether the Congress can criminalize such

    24           statutes.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  See, you may be right on the -- as


                    


                                                                            19

     1           an abstract question, if you were righting a law review

     2           article about what the vagueness rule should be here, but my

     3           two colleagues and I, because we're not the Supreme Court,

     4           have got to, as best we can, limit existing Supreme Court

     5           precedent and apply it here. 

     6                    And I have to tell you, Mr. Hansen, that I haven't

     7           found a hint in the Supreme Court's jurisprudence.  You may

     8           well be right that they will say criminal is different, but I

     9           haven't seen it yet.  This may be the case where they do it,

    10           but our problem is we have to apply the Supreme Court's

    11           jurisprudence as it exists today on May 10th, 1996, not as it

    12           may apply because of your successful advocacy in the Supreme

    13           Court, wouldn't you agree?

    14                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh, I certainly agree with that.  But I

    15           think that in forming your decision you can say to the

    16           Supreme Court, you can establish the factual record with the

    17           Supreme Court that we've looked at this particular statute

    18           and these particular phrases and what we have found is that

    19           the people involved in trying to help us define what they

    20           mean have not been able to define them for us.

    21                    I mean let's talk about some of the testimony that's

    22           come out.  The -- Mr. Schmidt who says that it would be

    23           indecent or patently offensive, the Vanity Fair cover would

    24           be indecent or patently offensive, Mr. Olsen who says that

    25           Playboy is indecent or patently offensive and that all the


                    


                                                                            20

     1           dirty words are indecent or patently offensive, the FCC which

     2           says the crude jokes are patently offensive.

     3                    On the other hand, and morality in media, one of the

     4           amici in this case which says that the discussion of gay

     5           rights in some parts of cyberspace is patently offensive or

     6           indecent.

     7                    On the other hand we have the Government suggesting

     8           that discussion of gay rights is not patently offensive, but

     9           the facts in this case suggest --

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But doesn't that --

    11                    MR. HANSEN:  -- we don't know how to define these

    12           terms.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But the problem with that is doesn't

    14           your argument ultimately prove too much because the indecency

    15           in patently offensive locutions, some of the patently

    16           offensive locution comes right out of the Miller

    17           jurisprudence.

    18                    And, for example, you've spent a good deal of time

    19           arguing with a good deal of force, I think, about the

    20           different community problems because it's one thing to

    21           broadcast in a local area, but cyberspace, once something is

    22           on it, it's there world wide.  But if we take that argument

    23           to its logical conclusion, we're going to read out the

    24           obscenity definition of Miller, aren't we?

    25                    MR. HANSEN:  No, I think because I think obscenity


                    


                                                                            21

     1           in Miller benefits from the interplay of all three factors. 

     2           I think if obscenity in Miller were just patent offensiveness

     3           I think we would be having trouble.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No, the community issue because--

     5                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- because the patent offensiveness

     7           also has the limiting phrase by contemporary community

     8           standards and that of course also comes from Miller.

     9                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, that's one of the ways in which I

    10           think the application of this -- that particular phrase to

    11           this statute presents us with particular problems.  I mean in

    12           Miller we know pretty much now that the community standards

    13           applies to local community standards.  In this case we've got

    14           a whole series of proposals about what community standards

    15           means.  We don't know for sure whether it's national

    16           community standards or local community standards.  The

    17           Government's witness suggested it was local community

    18           standards, the conference report suggests it's national

    19           community standards.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Can we decide this case on the

    21           preliminary injunction phase of it without reaching the

    22           vagueness issue?

    23                    MR. HANSEN:  Sure, yes, absolutely you can.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Because you haven't told us how

    25           yet.


                    


                                                                            22

     1                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, I think there are two ways that

     2           you can.  I think one is -- and one is the over-breadth which

     3           you've now pushed me to a second time and I'll now go to --

     4                    (Laughter.)

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I don't even see a timer here.  Do

     6           you have a timer?

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  We have  the clock, Judge Sloviter. 

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, well, I don't follow that.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I've been watching it.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, I'm used to yellow lights and

    11           green lights.

    12                    MR. HANSEN:  I may not have got it the first time,

    13           your Honor, but I got it the second time.

    14                    (Laughter.)

    15                    MR. HANSEN:  And the other way I think you can,

    16           before I go on to over-breadth, the other way I think you 

    17           can -- 

    18                    (Laughter.) 

    19                    MR. HANSEN:  -- is what Mr. Ennis is going to talk

    20           about and that is the whether it's technologically or

    21           economically feasible to comply with the statute.

    22                    If the statute is read to include material that is

    23           valuable both for adults and for minors --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We have to read the -- we have to

    25           read the statute the way it's written, don't we?  We'll talk


                    


                                                                            23

     1           to the Government about its effort to change the statutory

     2           language but our problem right now is not what the Supreme

     3           Court is going to do because the Supreme Court may surprise

     4           us all and not take this case.  We have an obligation to

     5           decide the case in front of us.

     6                    Now, on what is the narrowest ground on which we can

     7           decide this preliminary injunction issue?

     8                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, I'm not sure I know what the

     9           narrowest way is.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right.

    11                    MR. HANSEN:  But I think you can say that the act,

    12           as written, reaches speech that is constitutionally protected

    13           both for minors and for adults.  I think the first question

    14           is whether it reaches speech that is constitutionally

    15           protected for adults, I don't think there's really any

    16           serious dispute about that.  I also don't think, as for the

    17           reasons Mr. Ennis will be discussing, I don't think there's

    18           that much serious dispute that an awful lot of adults are

    19           going to be precluded from obtaining access to this kind of

    20           speech as a result of this act.

    21                    I mean just to take the most simple example, if we

    22           accept the credit card screening mechanism that the

    23           Government suggests, there are an awful lot of adults that

    24           don't have credit cards and that won't be able to obtain

    25           access to speech that is constitution-- they're


                    


                                                                            24

     1           constitutionally entitled to get simply because they don't

     2           have a credit card.

     3                    I mean it reminds me of one of the exhibits the

     4           Government suggested in which they said that every 15 year

     5           old in America is computer literate.  Well, there are 15 year

     6           olds in America that aren't literate, much less computer

     7           literate.  Similarly, there are adults that don't have credit

     8           cards and under this scheme won't be able to obtain access to

     9           this information.

    10                    So the first issue and the issue where you can stop

    11           if you reach this issue is whether this will prevent adults

    12           from having access to information that they are

    13           constitutionally entitled to.  It's the Butler argument, it's

    14           the Sable argument.  That is that what we have done in this

    15           context is we have, in the guise of protecting children,

    16           we've prevented adult, we've required that all speech be

    17           brought down to the level acceptable to the most vulnerable

    18           minor.

    19                    But if that, if you are unpersuaded by that part of

    20           the argument, then I think you also have to go ahead and

    21           reach the question of whether the speech in this case is

    22           protected from minors as well as for adults.  It is clear

    23           that minors do have rights to speech, it's clear that minors

    24           do have rights to obtain access to speech.

    25                    In this instance what we have is a huge volume of


                    


                                                                            25

     1           speech that the undisputed testimony shows is valuable for

     2           minors.  And let me take a couple of the most obvious

     3           examples.

     4                    The safer sex information is probably the most

     5           obvious example.  The exhibits in the record and the

     6           testimony from the witnesses indicate that a great many

     7           minors, particularly older minors, are in fact sexually

     8           active.  Whether we like that or not is irrelevant, the fact

     9           is that they are sexually active.  And in order to protect

    10           themselves from diseases including the fatal disease of AIDS,

    11           in order to protect themselves from pregnancy which is of

    12           course a constitutional right for minors as well as for

    13           adults, it is important, it's not merely -- it's vital that

    14           they obtain access to the kinds of speech that my clients

    15           engage in.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  How do you answer the Government's

    17           argument that the act couldn't possibly be read to apply to

    18           information of that sort?

    19                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, I think there are -- I think the

    20           answer to it is embedded in the colloquy Judge Dalzell and I

    21           were having, that is this act prohibits speech that has

    22           serious value.  The Government's suggesting really that this

    23           case is really just about pornography, it's just about

    24           really, really sexually explicit stuff.  Well, it's not about

    25           obscenity, it's not about that level pornography, it's not


                    


                                                                            26

     1           about prurience because prurience is not an element of this,

     2           not a necessary element about this and it's not about serious

     3           value because speech that has serious value is punishable

     4           under this statute.

     5                    Well, if that's the case, it seems to me safer sex

     6           information is most certainly at jeopardy under this statute.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The Government suggests that we

     8           read this in the context of a conference report, is that

     9           correct?

    10                    MR. HANSEN:  Correct, yes.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But didn't the conference report

    12           specifically exclude a deletion of serious value?

    13                    MR. HANSEN:  No, it's the other way around.  The--

    14           one of the --

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It excluded, didn't it exclude,

    16           wasn't there an effort to put in an exclusion from the

    17           statute for --

    18                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh, yes.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- I used my words -- I thought I

    20           used my words carefully.

    21                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes, I'm sorry.  The --

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  There was an effort to exclude from

    23           the scope of the statute --

    24                    MR. HANSEN:  Matters of serious value.  That is

    25           there was an effort to make --


                    


                                                                            27

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If you haven't, I mean, isn't --

     2                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes, your Honor.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- that important?  And why don't

     4           you stress that in the argument.

     5                    MR. HANSEN:  Okay.

     6                    (Laughter.)

     7                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes, the one -- one member of Congress

     8           proposed that the statute substitute, harmful minor statute

     9           be substituted for the indecency and patent offensiveness.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's a separate issue.  

    11                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, harmful to minors includes

    12           prurience and includes value.  Congress explicitly rejected

    13           that alternative and both for the reasons you suggested and

    14           for the reason I'm now suggesting, Congress made, I think,

    15           crystal clear that value is part of this statute.  And if you

    16           engage in speech that is about sex, even if it has value, you

    17           risk going to jail under this statute.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I would like to know because --

    19           well, you've got about ten minutes left on this.  Let's

    20           assume we and/or the Supreme Court agree with you and the CDA

    21           is held unconstitutional.  So Senator Coates and Senator Exon

    22           come to you and say Mr. Hansen, you are obviously the right

    23           person with Mr. Ennis to talk to, here's the pen, write me a

    24           CDA.  Could you write a --

    25                    MR. HANSEN:  Somehow I don't think that will happen.


                    


                                                                            28

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Could you write a child a CDA that

     2           passes constitutional muster?

     3                    MR. HANSEN:  I'm not sure you could.  I mean

     4           Ginsburg suggests that a harmful to minors statute might well

     5           be constitutional.  The question then would be whether you

     6           could apply that standard in the context of cyberspace and I

     7           think the answer to that would, at least in large measure,

     8           depend upon the ability to comply with the statute which is--

     9           which is largely sort of the defenses issues that Mr. Ennis

    10           is going to be addressing.  My view is no, you could not.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So therefore the issue really is

    12           medium specific is what your argument is?

    13                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh, there's no question that the issue

    14           is medium specific.  All the case law and the defendants

    15           admit that whether -- that the rules are different from

    16           medium to medium and that what may be, for example, indecent

    17           in TV is not indecent here.  What may be an accept --

    18           constitutionally acceptable rule in the area of broadcast is

    19           not -- may not be a constitutionally acceptable rule here.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So your position is then that you

    21           would give the pen back to Senator Exon and Senator Coates

    22           and just say I'm terribly sorry but for this medium we can't

    23           do it?  Is that -- is that your position?

    24                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, yes, I would say that and then I

    25           would also say to Senators Exon and Coates: but I have a


                    


                                                                            29

     1           better solution for you to the problem that you're troubled

     2           about and that solution is the whole constellation of PICs

     3           and Surfwatch and the other mechanisms that empower parents

     4           to be able to prevent their children from having access to

     5           indecent material and yet don't infringe on constitutionally

     6           protected rights, either for children or for adults.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And they say to you that's okay,

     8           that's great, how do we make sure this happens, they say, we

     9           want to give you a law to make sure this happens.

    10                    MR. HANSEN:  I think my first answer would be relax

    11           for a second, it's happening.  I mean, you know, all of the--

    12           we have considerable evidence that PICs is coming along, it's

    13           going to be up very soon.  We have considerable evidence that

    14           AOL is work-- and the other on-line services are working

    15           rapidly to improve and tighten and strengthen their parental

    16           control mechanisms.  

    17                    The attention that this act has gotten and that this

    18           case has gotten has been enormous impetus toward people

    19           finding those kinds of parental --

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What level of scrutiny do we apply

    21           to this statute?

    22                    MR. HANSEN:  I don't think there's any question.  I

    23           think the Government concedes that this is -- that you have

    24           to find -- in order to uphold this statute you have to find,

    25           you have to apply strict scrutiny and you have to find that


                    


                                                                            30

     1           there is no -- that it is narrowly tailored.  Both

     2           requirements have to be found here before this statute can be

     3           upheld.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Have you commented on the narrow

     5           tailoring?

     6                    MR. HANSEN:  No, the narrow tailoring largely goes,

     7           I think, to the defenses which I think Mr. Ennis is going to

     8           address although there isn't --

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What do you mean the narrow

    10           tailoring goes to the defenses?  Can't you have a free speech

    11           case in which the statute doesn't have any written-in

    12           defenses?

    13                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Isn't that part of the basic

    15           concept of what we're supposed to do when we look at whether

    16           something's protected under the first amendment?

    17                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes, I think that -- I think that part

    18           of the question is, is the definition of speech here

    19           sufficiently narrowly tailored that it gets at the problem

    20           that Congress was trying to get at and doesn't reach out and

    21           get a -- and create other problems.  And I think for the

    22           reasons, all the reasons we've been talking about this

    23           morning, I think this speech clearly does reach out to speech

    24           well beyond that which the Government's professed interest

    25           covers.


                    


                                                                            31

     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Mr. Hansen, I've been concerned

     2           throughout this, my involvement in this, about the question

     3           of this being media specific.  And if it is media specific,

     4           what is your position is the media it's most analogous to and

     5           what is the Government's position.

     6                    But I don't want you to speak for the Government.

     7                    (Laughter.)

     8                    MR. HANSEN:  Our position certainly is that if we

     9           are to draw an analogy, print would be the appropriate

    10           analogy because in this -- but I think we would suggest to

    11           you that this is a medium different than all other media in

    12           the sense of its democratizing and many to many qualities. 

    13                    That is almost all the other media, with the

    14           possible exception of telephone, is a relatively limited

    15           number of speakers giving out information to a large number

    16           of listeners.  One of the real marvels of this medium is it's

    17           making us all speakers and listeners and thus we think it's

    18           entitled the highest protection because it enable-- it

    19           empowers the most number of speakers.

    20                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Thank you.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I want to get back for a second

    22           because it goes, I think, to your over-breadth argument here

    23           where you argue about that some minors, older minors should

    24           be entitled -- for example, sexually active minors.  But

    25           doesn't that undermine -- you would agree that Congress


                    


                                                                            32

     1           surely has the power to define who a minor is.

     2                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And any definition it comes up with

     4           is by definition one size fits all because if you get back

     5           from that don't you drive the courts to determine, for

     6           example, is this -- is 12 mature or is this child

     7           sufficiently mature, this one's sexually active, this one's

     8           not?  

     9                    And so to avoid that kind of unedifying wildly

    10           inefficient system, Congress as every legislature has the

    11           inherent power to say who is a minor and who isn't.  Isn't

    12           that right?

    13                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh, I think that's right, but I think

    14           their definition of the minor in the context of this statute

    15           has to bear some relationship to a valid governmental

    16           purpose.  That is, if they decided that a minor was 30, I

    17           think we would all have little difficulty throwing that out

    18           because we believe that there are 25 year olds who have, you

    19           know, the sufficient maturity and sufficient need for the

    20           kinds of speech we're talking about here that they ought to

    21           be able to have access to it.

    22                    Similarly, I think, we can say given the nature of

    23           the speech involved here and given the realities of the world

    24           that drawing the line at 18 in this context approaches the

    25           same level of irrationality in the sense that there are


                    


                                                                            33

     1           certainly 17 year olds who have sufficient maturity and

     2           sufficient --

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But isn't that an argument that you

     4           should make to Congress and not to us?

     5                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, I think it's --

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I mean could we say as a matter of

     7           constitutional law that the -- that the drawing the line at

     8           18 was so irrational as to violate, I assume, due process?

     9                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh, I think you can.  I think you can--

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You want us to say the statute

    11           would be constitutional if it was to 14?

    12                    MR. HANSEN:  No, I don't want you to say that, but I

    13           do -- but I do think --

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, then I don't understand what

    15           this argument goes to.

    16                    MR. HANSEN:  The question is whether this statute is

    17           reaching out to a great deal of information that basically

    18           everyone concedes is valuable, at least for a large number of

    19           minors.  And if it is in fact speech that is valuable for a

    20           large number of minors, not only not harmful but valuable,

    21           then the statute is over-broad even as it applies to minors

    22           and not just as it applies to adults.  And I think that's how

    23           I would use the question.

    24                    And I think -- 

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Go ahead.


                    


                                                                            34

     1                    MR. HANSEN:  I think there is some notion to the

     2           fact that the Government, the Congress can draw some lines in

     3           this area but where the line sweeps in large numbers of

     4           minors who are appropriately, who ought to be appropriately

     5           able to see this kind of information --

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Based on your reading of the

     7           jurisprudence, how substantial does the over-breadth have to

     8           be for it to cross the line of impermissibility?

     9                    MR. HANSEN:  I think if it -- if more than a small

    10           number of applications are involved then I think you have

    11           substantial over-breadth.  That is I think the over-breadth--

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What's your citation for that

    13           proposition?

    14                    MR. HANSEN:  I don't have one off the top of my head

    15           but I'll have one by the time of rebuttal, if you'd like.

    16                    (Laughter.)

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Fair enough.

    18                    MR. HANSEN:  I think the case -- the non substantial

    19           over-breadth cases, the cases that say we -- there's

    20           substantial over-breadth here --

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It was in your brief and in the

    22           ALA's brief.

    23                    MR. HANSEN:  They're in both briefs and they talked

    24           about the question -- it is possible to hypothesize a small

    25           number of applications that might be constitutionally


                    


                                                                            35

     1           protected and that's not what we're talking about in over-

     2           breadth.  And that's the line of cases I am drawing on for

     3           the answer.

     4                    In our view the -- one of the crucial parts of this

     5           case is that which we've just been discussing and that is the

     6           nature of this medium here.  We have what is a new medium, is

     7           an enormously exciting medium, it is a democratizing medium

     8           and it is an enormously evolving medium.

     9                    The testimony was undisputed that this medium is

    10           changing on a daily basis and changing rapidly.  This statute

    11           not only infringes constitutional rights in the ways we've

    12           talked about this morning but it also has the potential for

    13           stifling this new and exciting and dramatic medium and in our

    14           view this Court should find the statute unconstitutional.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Thank you.   

    16                    Shall we call Mr. Ennis?

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Sure.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Mr. Ennis?

    19                    MR. ENNIS:  Good morning, your Honors.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Good morning, Mr. Ennis.

    21                    MR. ENNIS:  Bruce Ennis representing the ALA

    22           plaintiffs.

    23                    I'm going to speak primarily about the Subsection E

    24           safe harbor defenses to Subsection D's criminal prohibition. 

    25           To put it in context, I think that it's fair to say that


                    


                                                                            36

     1           unless speakers can use the safe harbor defenses authorized

     2           by Subsection E, then Subsection D standing alone would

     3           constitute a flat ban on speech that is constitutionally

     4           protected for adults.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Let me ask you a general

     6           proposition, do you know of any criminal law that might have

     7           been unconstitutional but for defenses that were put in?  I

     8           mean this, the whole proposition that you can

     9           constitutionalize a possible over-broad or vague criminal law

    10           by defenses is a new one to me but there may be examples out

    11           there.  Can you think of any?

    12                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, Judge Sloviter, I think that's a

    13           key question in our case.  I'm not aware of any.  There --

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I guess it's a question for the

    15           Government then, giving them advance notice.

    16                    MR. ENNIS:   The closest I can think of that, your

    17           Honor, are examples from broadcast and Dial-A-Porn but

    18           they're not like this law.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But they're not criminal statutes,

    20           are they?

    21                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, both -- yes, they are both

    22           criminal statutes.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    24                    MR. ENNIS:  Though the FCC has never sought or

    25           obtained criminal sanctions in the broadcast area against


                    


                                                                            37

     1           indecent speech.  And --

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, although Pacific and Southern

     3           Company, Incorporated, licensee of radio station KSD-FM, when

     4           it got fined -- they called it a forfeiture of $2,000, smells

     5           like a fine to me.

     6                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, it certainly is and it's an

     7           administrative fine, your Honor.  All I'm pointing out is

     8           that the Supreme Court stressed in its Pacifica decision that

     9           it was not dealing with a criminal sanction.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Quite right, you're quite right.

    11                    MR. ENNIS:  But let me return to your question

    12           because it is an important question.  In every other medium

    13           where Government attempts to regulate or criminalize

    14           indecency, in every other medium speakers have a sure and

    15           safe way of complying with the act, all speakers.

    16                    For example, in broadcast, speakers know that if

    17           they broadcast the indecent material only in the evening

    18           hours that are specified by FCC as okay for indecent

    19           material, they are at no risk whatsoever of any governmental

    20           statute.

    21                    In the dial-a-porn context which only regulates

    22           commercial dial-a-porn, all commercial providers of dial-a-

    23           porn can use a credit card which is a complete defense, all

    24           speakers in the commercial dial-a-porn context have a sure

    25           and safe and completely effective safe harbor.  That is


                    


                                                                            38

     1           emphatically not the case with respect to this act.

     2                    So it does raise the question you've asked, is there

     3           ever an example in which you can ban speech and then put the

     4           affirmative burden on the speaker to show with evidence and

     5           an affirmative defense to a prosecution that their speech

     6           somehow comes within a safe harbor and the answer is no.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  And then in -- and of course

     8           if the Government disagrees though we expect it will tell us,

     9           but to whom is the safe harbor provision, the defense

    10           provision available?  Is it available for all of the persons

    11           who might, individuals who might be held liable under A and D

    12           or only some of them?

    13                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honor, the defense on its face is

    14           available and in fact must be raised as an affirmative

    15           defense by all of the millions of speakers who use the

    16           Internet.

    17                    In reality, as I hope to show this morning, the

    18           defense is not available to any speakers who use the Internet

    19           except for commercial speakers who charge for access to their

    20           speech.  With that sole exception, not one of the so-called

    21           safe harbor defenses can with any reasonable --

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, apparently those defenses are

    23           merely evidence, as I understand Mr. Keeney's letter to our

    24           colleagues in New York, right?

    25                    MR. ENNIS:  That's at most what they are.


                    


                                                                            39

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  At most evidence.

     2                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, that's right, the Keeney letter--

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But it's still going to be up to a

     4           jury to determine whether that carries today, right?

     5                    MR. ENNIS:  That's correct, Judge Dalzell.  The

     6           Keeney letter says that at most, if a defendant takes the

     7           steps the Government suggests, a speaker takes the steps the

     8           Government suggests, at most that would be, quote,

     9           "substantial evidence" which that defendant in a criminal

    10           prosecution could then argue to a jury would qualify for the

    11           safe harbor defense.

    12                    But it would be up to disparate juries throughout

    13           the country.

    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  But in a criminal setting the

    15           burden would always be on the Government to prove that it was

    16           not a good faith defense, it would never be upon the --

    17                    MR. ENNIS:  You would think so, Judge Buckwalter,

    18           but-- 

    19                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Or even in insanity.

    20                    MR. ENNIS:  But that is not the way this statute is

    21           set up, which was Judge Sloviter's question.  This statute,

    22           Subsection -- let me try and break it out.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Go ahead.

    24                    MR. ENNIS:  If you start with Subsection D,

    25           Subsection D flatly prohibits the display of patently


                    


                                                                            40

     1           offensive speech in a manner that would be, quote, "available

     2           to minors."

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right.

     4                    MR. ENNIS:  As we've shown in our proposed findings

     5           of fact 855, we've collected all the evidence, there's no

     6           dispute on it, you cannot display speech on the Internet in a

     7           way that's broadly available to adults without that speech

     8           necessarily also being broadly available to minors.

     9                    So what that means is if you just look at Subsection

    10           D by itself, Subsection D criminalizes the display of speech

    11           on the Internet that would be broadly available to adults

    12           because it necessarily would be broadly available to minors

    13           as well.

    14                    Thus unless the Subsection E safe harbor defenses

    15           narrow the sweep of Subsection D, Subsection D would quite

    16           clearly be unconstitutional under Bolger, under Sable and

    17           under Butler, all of which unanimously hold that Government 

    18           cannot constitutionally ban speech to adults even for the

    19           purpose of protecting minors.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sure.  And what did the trick in

    21           Sable was the defense.

    22                    MR. ENNIS:  It was the defense.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And that's what Congress did, at

    24           least what Congress thought they were doing.  Isn't it fair

    25           to say what Congress thought they were doing in this statute


                    


                                                                            41

     1           was they reached into Pacifica and they reached into Sable

     2           and they threw it in to the CDA and they said it's got to be

     3           constitutional because the Supreme Court says so.

     4                    MR. ENNIS:  Exactly right, Judge Dalzell.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Isn't that a fair characterization?

     6                    MR. ENNIS:  That is completely fair.  The

     7           legislative history bears that out.  Congress thought --

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What about the use of the word

     9           "knowingly?"  Throughout this long proceeding I haven't heard

    10           anybody focus on the fact that Subsection D to which you

    11           refer specifically makes criminal only that which is

    12           knowingly sent to persons under 18 and knowingly permits

    13           under Subsection 2.  Wouldn't that be part of the

    14           Government's required case in chief and what does it mean?

    15                    MR. ENNIS:  I'm not sure, the Government would have

    16           to tell you what that means. It's unclear to me what it

    17           means.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But it's in there.

    19                    MR. ENNIS:  It is in there and -- but and also is in

    20           there for Subsection D, but for Subsection D --

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It is D I'm talking about.

    22                    MR. ENNIS:  On its face it would simply mean knowing

    23           that you have displayed speech.  If --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Don't you have to also know that

    25           it's a person under 18?


                    


                                                                            42

     1                    MR. ENNIS:  No, under D you only have to know that

     2           you have displayed speech in a manner that is, quote,

     3           "available" to a person under 18, whether anyone under 18

     4           ever had access to the speech or not.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, then that's not A, you're not

     6           talking about D(1)(A), you're talking about D(1)(B).  And one

     7           says knowingly.  In other words, whoever in interstate or

     8           foreign communications knowingly uses any interactive

     9           computer service to display in a manner available to a person

    10           under 18 is part of the Government's burden to show that you,

    11           that the speaker or sender knew that there were people under

    12           18 receiving it?

    13                    MR. ENNIS:  I think that the fair inference from the

    14           statute would be that that would be so, but I don't know what

    15           the Government's position on that is.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, lots of times we have been

    17           advised to construe a statute to construe the knowingly

    18           language in such a way as to make the statute constitutional. 

    19           That's a construction that is consistent with the language of

    20           the statute itself, we don't have to cut out any -- any

    21           provision.

    22                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes. 

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Isn't your point that America On

    24           Line, for example, or Compuserve has to know, they have to

    25           know because they'd be stupid not to know that it is


                    


                                                                            43

     1           available to people under 18 because there's no way of not

     2           making it available to people under 18?

     3                    MR. ENNIS:  That is the whole point, Judge Dalzell. 

     4           And if you make the speech broadly available to adults on the

     5           Internet, if you wish to speak to the world, this speech will

     6           necessarily be available to minors as well and you will know

     7           that it is available to minors as well and therefore --

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And you won't be heard to say I

     9           didn't know.

    10                    MR. ENNIS:  Right.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Mr. Burrington could not appear in a

    12           courtroom in the District of Ohio where he's from AOL,

    13           whoever Compuserve is, and say oh, I didn't know there were

    14           people under 18.  He'd be cut to shreds by Mr. Coppolino and

    15           his friends on cross-examination, wouldn't he?

    16                    MR. ENNIS:  That's correct.  That's why Subsection D

    17           bans display of speech in a manner that's available to minors

    18           on the Internet.  And your question was didn't Congress

    19           simply think this is okay, we'll borrow the dial-a-porn

    20           analogy?  Unfortunately, Congress did not hold hearings on

    21           the nature of the Internet and it did not focus on this

    22           question.  It thought that the dial-a-porn analogy would

    23           work, it doesn't because the vast majority of speakers on the

    24           Internet do not charge for access to their speech.

    25                    There is a small subset of speakers on the Internet


                    


                                                                            44

     1           who do charge for access to their speech and those speakers

     2           can, with the dial-a-porn analogy, require the presentation

     3           of a credit card before they allow access to their speech. 

     4           It is a defense for that small subset of speakers.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Therefore your argument goes

     6           perversely the CDA if it were upheld, the people who could

     7           easiest, who could comply with it the easiest are precisely

     8           the pornographers.

     9                    MR. ENNIS:  It's even more than that, your Honor. 

    10           That's correct but it's even more than that.  The

    11           pornographers, the commercial pornographers who are charging

    12           for access to their speech were requiring credit cards before

    13           this act was passed.  They would continue to require credit

    14           cards if this act were enjoined, they would continue to

    15           require credit cards if the act were repealed.  This act does

    16           nothing to protect minors from the commercial speech by

    17           commercial purveyors of sexually explicit speech because they

    18           already require credit cards.

    19                    What the act does instead is to burden the huge

    20           range of non-commercial speakers on the Internet and say to

    21           them you cannot make your speech available for free to the

    22           world unless you carry the affirmative burden of coming

    23           within the safe harbors.

    24                    There are only three possible  types of safe harbors

    25           the Government has suggested and none of them can be used by


                    


                                                                            45

     1           non-commercial speakers.  The three categories I think can

     2           usefully be thought of as falling into three groups.  One is

     3           called charging, another would be called screening and a

     4           third would be called warning.  I think that's a fair way to

     5           think of these.

     6                    We just talked a little bit about the charging.  You

     7           can charge for your speech on the Internet but the evidence

     8           is undisputed that the only speakers who can use, require a

     9           credit card before giving access to their speech are

    10           commercial speakers who are actually charging for their

    11           speech.

    12                    Credit card companies simply will not verify credit

    13           cards for non-commercial transactions, they don't do it. 

    14           Therefore if I have a Webpage and I want to make my speech

    15           available for free, I don't have the option of using the

    16           verified credit card defense.  No credit card company will

    17           verify it.  And that's true for the vast majority of speakers

    18           on the Internet.

    19                    So we can forget charging as a safe harbor defense

    20           for most speakers.  That brings us to screening.  Screening

    21           requires two things:  screening the content of the material

    22           to decide which material would be inappropriate for minors

    23           and therefore would have to be segregated into a different

    24           area and then would require screening for age, so that when

    25           people attempt to access the material that is the adults only


                    


                                                                            46

     1           material, you would be able to determine whether the person

     2           attempting to access the adult material was an adult or a

     3           minor.

     4                    The evidence is quite clear on that that you cannot,

     5           there's no technological way to screen for age based on

     6           current available technology, it simply can't be done.  And

     7           in huge areas of the Internet News Groups, IRC Chat, lists or

     8           mail exploders, it is technologically impossible for the

     9           speaker to get an adult ID number or a credit card number, it

    10           can't be done.

    11                    And I want to emphasize something here because we've

    12           spent most of the time in this case talking about Webpages

    13           and the World Wide Web because that's a popular way of

    14           speaking on the Internet.  We haven't spent as much time

    15           talking about  News Groups, Chat Rooms and mail exploders for

    16           the very good reason that there's no dispute that the safe

    17           harbor defenses can't be used in those areas, credit card and

    18           adult access codes can't be used on those areas. 

    19                    But the important point is those are huge areas of t

    20           he Internet.  There are hundreds of thousands of messages a

    21           day that are posted to News Groups.  So we've concentrated a

    22           lot on the World Wide Web, but when we realized that this law

    23           bans speech in all those areas of the Internet, we're talking

    24           about substantial number of applications.

    25                    The third possible way of coming within a safe


                    


                                                                            47

     1           harbor is the Government has suggested there are really two

     2           ways to --

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Can you go back to the one before

     4           for a minute?

     5                    MR. ENNIS:  Sure.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You argue that screening becomes

     7           ineffective or unusable because of the need for a common

     8           gateway interface?  Could you -- I think you argued that in

     9           your brief?

    10                    MR. ENNIS:  Well --

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Would you just bring us into that,

    12           explain why that is?

    13                    MR. ENNIS:  The reason that is in news groups, chat

    14           rooms and list services is there is no simultaneous

    15           communication between the speaker and the listener and the

    16           listener has no way of communicating directly with the

    17           speaker.  So it's not possible to transmit the adult ID code

    18           or the credit card number in those mediums of communication. 

    19                    On Web sites it is possible, it is theoretically and

    20           technologically possible for the speaker and the listener to

    21           communicate interactively.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The big companies don't use comment

    23           room except common gateway interface.  Am I misreading the

    24           testimony?

    25                    MR. ENNIS:  No, you're -- you're completely correct,


                    


                                                                            48

     1           Judge Sloviter.  I was just trying to explain that in Web

     2           sites in general it is possible to have that kind of two-way

     3           exchange of information to send adult ID codes and credit

     4           card numbers back and forth, but for all of the Web sites

     5           that are offered by the major on-line service providers,

     6           those Web sites do not have the CGI common gateway

     7           interference script capacity that is needed to have that

     8           dialogue, so those Web sites can't do it.

     9                    The only Web sites really that can do it are

    10           separate commercial Web sites that are set up by commercial

    11           providers of sexually explicit material.  And they do it and

    12           they require credit card payment.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, you were going to your third,

    14           the warning.

    15                    MR. ENNIS:  The third is give warning.  The

    16           Government suggested there are basically two ways of coming

    17           within this safe harbor defense and that is to tag your

    18           speech, to self label your speech in some way as

    19           inappropriate for minors or to register your speech with the

    20           Internet Yellow Pages or with one or ten or fifty of the 200

    21           and so additional directories of Internet listings.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Are we to take that point seriously

    23           in light of what's happened to Compuserve?  Because they did

    24           take it and with that service that's in question that you

    25           brought to us, to our attention, it is, it says it's adult,


                    


                                                                            49

     1           it's tagged.  But it didn't prevent the headlines to

     2           Compuserve in the Ohio newspapers and I'm sure that ruined

     3           their day, don't you think?

     4                    MR. ENNIS:  I think it --

     5                    (Laughter.)

     6                    MR. ENNIS:  I think it -- I think it more than

     7           ruined their day, your Honor.  If you're a commercial on-line

     8           provider and there are headlines around the country saying

     9           you're being investigated or reviewed or whatever the word is

    10           for being a purveyor of pornography to children, you're not

    11           going to sign up a whole lot of new subscribers that day or

    12           for many days to come.  It more than ruined their day.

    13                    The -- I think you're right.  We can't  take --

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I mean that suggests to me, and of

    15           course I'm going to ask our friends on the other side about

    16           this, are they really serious about these defenses?  Because

    17           that material was tagged, it had a warning. 

    18                    MR. ENNIS:  It had a warning and it not only had a

    19           warning, it was within the proprietary service and it said

    20           you can click this button and that material is not available

    21           to any minors in your household.

    22                    So not only was it tagged, not only was it in a

    23           separate directory, it also came packaged with a completely

    24           effective parental control device.  Even so, that matter was

    25           referred on to the FBI.


                    


                                                                            50

     1                    Now, the Government can't seriously argue that

     2           tagging or putting your name in a registry would constitute a

     3           safe harbor defense.  The most they've ever argued in their

     4           brief is that it, quote, "might qualify."

     5                    And the Keeney letter says at most it's substantial

     6           evidence and it's only substantial evidence if the evidence

     7           of tagging is coupled with, quote, "evidence that the

     8           marketplace of browsers are actually screening for that

     9           particular tag."

    10                    There was testimony at trial that that is

    11           technologically impossible today.  It is not technologically

    12           impossible today for speakers to know, to have evidence

    13           whether the marketplace of browsers are actually screening,

    14           so it's an evidence that's totally impossible to provide.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, what -- I find both your

    16           position and the Government's position somewhat inconsistent

    17           internally.  You say you should, you have a better

    18           alternative and that is to have parents do it via Surfwatch

    19           and groups like that and yet you argue that the Government's 

    20           tagging system is not effective, nobody said it's really

    21           working yet.  The Government says its tagging system is the

    22           one that we should use but yours is not working and

    23           effective.

    24                    Now, either there is a potential tagging system for,

    25           workable tagging system for both parties or there isn't.  The


                    


                                                                            51

     1           evidence shows that there was some success by Surfwatch but

     2           minuscule really in the totality of the Internet.

     3                    What is your position as to why your position is not

     4           inconsistent?

     5                    MR. ENNIS:  I understand your question, your Honor. 

     6           It is a complicated question, let me try to explain that.  In

     7           order to explain it, I have to back up a half step.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Go ahead.

     9                    MR. ENNIS:  And indicate that even if a speaker tags

    10           or puts their -- registers with a registry, all it does is

    11           warn listeners, give them notice of the nature of the speech

    12           so that if they wanted to block the speech and had the

    13           software capacity, they could do so.

    14                    But the Government's experts agree that without the

    15           cooperation of the end user with people down the

    16           communication chain, merely tagging speech or registering it

    17           in a registry does nothing whatsoever to prevent access to

    18           that speech by minors.  In fact, using search engines minors

    19           can more easily gain access to that speech.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Then why do you rely on Surfwatch

    21           and groups like that to say that is a least restrictive

    22           alternative?

    23                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, let me explain that, your Honor. 

    24           What's wrong with the Government's tagging proposal is it is

    25           completely dependent on end users, parental responsibility,


                    


                                                                            52

     1           or it won't shield a single minor from anything.  

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But so is PICs.

     3                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes, yes, it is, but there's a diff--

     4           here's the difference, your Honor.  If the parent is going to

     5           be a responsible parent and is going to take steps to protect

     6           their children, with PICs, the parent can set the PICs

     7           browser so that it will not allow access to any speech on the

     8           Internet unless the speech has been rated as appropriate by a

     9           third-party bureau the parent knows and trusts.

    10                    That would completely protect minors from

    11           inappropriate material without requiring speakers to self-

    12           label or tag their speech at all.

    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  And that's the essential

    14           difference --

    15                    MR. ENNIS:  And that's the essential --

    16                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- in a nutshell.

    17                    MR. ENNIS:  It is.

    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  You don't want the speaker to

    19           have to do anything and the Government wants the speaker to

    20           have to make some judgment.

    21                    MR. ENNIS:  That's the point, your Honor. 

    22                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay.

    23                    MR. ENNIS:  That is exactly the point because the

    24           Government -- 

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Are PICs currently working?


                    


                                                                            53

     1                    MR. ENNIS:  Actually, the press reports yesterday

     2           indicated that two days ago the final PIC standards are out,

     3           it will be working in July.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right.  We don't have any, I

     5           think we have to rely on the evidence that was before us.  We

     6           don't have any evidence that PICs is currently working. 

     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, we --

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, wait a minute, could he

     9           answer my question first?

    10                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Right.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You can -- go ahead.  And, yeah,

    12           it's directed to him.

    13                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, that's right and that's evidence,

    14           what that means is that PICs isn't working to block the

    15           Government's tags either, so that  there's no safe harbor

    16           today, even if speakers use the Government's L-18 pack.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But didn't Mr. Vesser who's from the

    18           Worldwide Web consortium, didn't he tell us that PICs would

    19           be operational in three to six months?

    20                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes, it will be.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But that is in the record. 

    22                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes.  Probably in June or July it will

    23           be operational.  There are -- there are --

    24                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Mr. Ennis, let me get back to the

    25           point here, at this point, and then -- it might be the right


                    


                                                                            54

     1           time to get back to it.  You gave a little bit of short

     2           shrift and I'm sure not intentionally to my talking about

     3           burden of proof here.  Burden of proof may not be important,

     4           I'm not sure yet, but isn't the burden of proof always going

     5           to be on the Government in a case like this to prove that the

     6           defendant has not -- the burden's not going to be on the

     7           defendant to prove his safe harbor is effective, it's going

     8           to be on the Government to prove that it's not effective. 

     9                    MR. ENNIS:  I'm afraid not, your Honor.

    10                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Because it's like a defense of

    11           insanity.  I mean you can arrange a defense of insanity but

    12           the Government has to prove you were sane, you don't have to

    13           prove you were insane. 

    14                    MR. ENNIS:  Well --

    15                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  And isn't that the same analogy

    16           here?

    17                    MR. ENNIS:  It's been a long time since I looked at

    18           the insanity defense but my recollection is the Government

    19           has to prove you had the mental intent to commit the crime

    20           but you bear the burden of establishing insanity defense.

    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, no, well, I don't -- that's 

    22           a -- that isn't really what you and I have here.  I think the

    23           same is true in a consensual defense to rape, for example. 

    24           You may raise that defense but the Government has the burden

    25           of proving it was non-consensual.  You don't have any burden


                    


                                                                            55

     1           to --

     2                    MR. ENNIS:  Well --               

     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- to prove it was consensual. 

     4           So I mean in this, so in this --

     5                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honor --

     6                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- context of criminal law --

     7                    MR. ENNIS:  Let me say that --

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Why don't you wait till the rest of

     9           the question, the rest of Judge Buckwalter's question came

    10           out.

    11                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yeah, I was going to say in the

    12           context of criminal law isn't the burden going to be on the

    13           Government here?  Once the defendant raises the fact of well,

    14           I tried to do this and this is what I did, he doesn't have to

    15           prove that was effective, the Government has to prove that it

    16           was not.

    17                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honor, I would hope so.  That's not

    18           my understanding of the Government's position, but it doesn't

    19           matter.

    20                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I'll talk to them about that.

    21                    MR. ENNIS:  It doesn't matter because even if the

    22           burden is on the Government, still the speaker can have no

    23           assurance whatsoever that if they take the steps the

    24           Government suggests they will surely and safely have a safe

    25           harbor, even if the burden is on the Government to prove that


                    


                                                                            56

     1           the steps were not effective rather on them to prove that the

     2           steps were effective, they are still at risk of losing that

     3           battle in front of a jury.  And it could be any jury in any

     4           community in America.

     5                    Therefore, no prudent speaker --

     6                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yeah, well, now I'm not exactly

     7           sure I know where this burden of proof argument goes in this

     8           whole scheme of things but I did want to discuss it.

     9                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, I think it's a very important

    10           point and the way I would say it is the statute is

    11           unconstitutional, whether the burden is on the Government to

    12           deal with the safe harbor defenses or the burden is on the

    13           speaker.  The unconstitutionality is compounded if the burden

    14           is on the speaker.

    15                    But backing up to Judge Sloviter's question, there

    16           are right now today through all of the major on-line service

    17           providers ways to block access through Compuserve or Prodigy,

    18           for example, to all speech on the Internet that the parents

    19           don't want to come in or on America On Line to block access

    20           to all areas of the Internet except the small areas that

    21           America On Line has prescreened and put in their Kids Only

    22           room as appropriate for children.

    23                    So there are end user capacities for everyone who

    24           uses the on-line service providers to block access to the

    25           Internet today.


                    


                                                                            57

     1                    The point I'm trying to make with this -- the

     2           difference between the Government's proposal and ours is the

     3           act, tagging and registering cannot possibly protect minors

     4           unless parents acquire software that will read the tags and

     5           then turn it on and use it.

     6                    If the parents do that, there is no need for the act

     7           because they can block access to all inappropriate speech

     8           even if no speaker ever self-labeled or rated their speech

     9           and even if there had never been any act at all.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Doesn't Dr. Olsen's proposal, the

    11           minus L-18 proposal have at least one advantage over PICs, as

    12           I understand the testimony?  And that is with his tagging

    13           proposal you could tag the four-letter words in the

    14           Canterbury Tales, let's say, and expurgate the Canterbury

    15           Tales by tagging those words, whereas as I understand PICs,

    16           the best you could do would be to give each page a URL and

    17           delete the whole page that has a four-letter word on it.  Do

    18           I understand the testimony correctly?

    19                    MR. ENNIS:  The testimony was to my mind somewhat

    20           confusing on that point but I think that may be an accurate

    21           recollection of the testimony.  There are some advantages to

    22           the L-18 over PICs and some -- and many advantages to PICs

    23           over L-18.  The principal advantage of L-18 is it's typing in

    24           four key strokes, that's it.  The principal disadvantage of

    25           L-18 is it's a blockbuster, all-or-nothing approach. 


                    


                                                                            58

     1           Everything is either patently offensive or it's okay.

     2                    Whereas with PICs you can say well, this has some

     3           nudity but it's in the context of a serious piece of

     4           literature or --

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Even under PICs, for example, we

     6           heard from Mr. Kuromiya and his group.  When PICs becomes

     7           operational doesn't Mr. Kuromiya have a tough call to make

     8           about the critical path information?  Because as I understand

     9           his testimony, he said we want to reach those sexually active

    10           teenagers who are under 18.  So far from having a good faith

    11           defense that I did what I could to prevent it, he's going to

    12           come in and tell the jury:  I want to reach them.  In fact, I

    13           want to pander and titillate them because I need to get their

    14           attention to help save lives.

    15                    So what's he going to do with PICs?

    16                    MR. ENNIS:  I think that your question illustrates

    17           another difference between PICs and the Government's proposal

    18           which is quite important to understand.  PICs primarily

    19           relies upon ratings by third parties that the parent can no

    20           or trust.  In that example perhaps Planned Parenthood would

    21           rate Web sites of material that's sexually explicit but

    22           appropriate for minors.  The parent might trust Planned

    23           Parenthood.  They go to Planned Parenthood and Planned

    24           Parenthood says yes, you can let your child access Kuromiya's

    25           Web site, that's okay, it's good, it's valuable information.


                    


                                                                            59

     1                    The Government's proposal, the parent would have to

     2           know and trust each of the individual millions of speakers on

     3           the Internet.  Why would a parent do that?  Why would a

     4           parent have any reason whatsoever to trust that some

     5           individual speaker they know nothing about is accurately and

     6           appropriately labeling their speech or is inappropriately

     7           labeling their speech?

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Why would a parent trust anyone to

     9           do that?  Isn't that a similar indictment of the Surf Watch

    10           et al. argument?

    11                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, a parent certainly could come to

    12           rely upon third-party rating bureaus that the parent has some

    13           knowledge of, for example, the Christian Coalition could have

    14           a rating service that many parents might turn to, the ACLU

    15           might have one, Planned Parenthood might have one.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  How feasible are any of these in

    17           light of the evidence in this case of the millions of

    18           communications that go on all the time on the Internet?  And

    19           that's both for the Government's proposal and your proposal.

    20                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, what that comes down to, Judge

    21           Sloviter, is the amount of risk that individual parents are

    22           willing to tolerate with respect to their own children.

    23                    And the advantage of PICs and Surf Watch Manager and

    24           all of the other products we've talked about is they give

    25           parents total control, all the way from zero access to the


                    


                                                                            60

     1           Internet to unrestricted access to the Internet or anything

     2           in between, based upon the parents' judgment of the balance

     3           that's appropriate for their children.

     4                    That's why -- that's another reason why our proposal

     5           is better than the Government's but the most important reason

     6           why it's better, let me get right to that, is that the

     7           Government's proposal, the Government's tagging and

     8           registration proposal will be completely ineffective at

     9           blocking or deterring any of the substantial amount of

    10           sexually explicit speech that is posted abroad.

    11                    By definition the criminal laws of this United --

    12           United States are not going to deter the posting of indecent

    13           or patently offensive material abroad.

    14                    So the Government's tagging system won't work, it

    15           just can't, can't work at all.

    16                    There was testimony by Ann Duvall that at least 30

    17           percent of the sites blocked by Surf Watch are foreign sites. 

    18           There was testimony by Donna Hoffman that at least 40 percent

    19           of all the host computers connected to the Internet are

    20           located abroad and that the percentage of foreign computers,

    21           as a percentage of the total, is rapidly approaching 50

    22           percent.

    23                    There's no reason to think that there's any less

    24           percentage of sexually explicit material posted on foreign

    25           computers than on domestic computers, so it's probable that


                    


                                                                            61

     1           about 50 percent of the sexually explicit material available

     2           on the Internet is posted abroad.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Didn't Dr. Olsen or Mr. Schmidt, I

     4           forget who, say well, that's all true, but if we have the

     5           tagging we can concentrate all of our energy on the offshore

     6           content and so we've reduced our problem by, to take your

     7           figures, half.

     8                    MR. ENNIS:  But it just doesn't, it makes no sense

     9           at all.  If they have the tagging but parents are not using

    10           the blocking software, the tagging does nothing.  If the

    11           parents are using the blocking software you don't need the

    12           tagging to keep all of that speech away from children. In

    13           fact, it's only with the use of the end user software that

    14           you can block access to the foreign material as well.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But on the PICs proposal there was a

    16           lot of discussion in the testimony and in your questions and

    17           in the briefing about differing communities and differing

    18           communities having different standards of indecency, let's

    19           say.  I don't see how PICs deals with that because PICs is

    20           still an all or -- or tagging for that matter, they're still

    21           all or nothing.

    22                    The example I gave of Brainerd, Minnesota versus New

    23           York City, okay, which I think most people would agree are

    24           rather different communities, PICs would either block both

    25           places or not block both places, same thing with tagging,


                    


                                                                            62

     1           right?  So you don't deal with the community issue with PICs.

     2                    MR. ENNIS:  That raises the fundamental question

     3           with this law because the law makes it a crime to make speech

     4           available in a way that's available to minors.  And if a

     5           parent isn't using PICs  or Surf Watch, that speech will be

     6           available in all those communities you talked about.  That's

     7           the fundamental problem with the law.

     8                    If Congress had thought about this, they might have

     9           tried to come up with a much more sensible law that could

    10           have done many things.  For example, it could have encouraged

    11           the development of these end-user software products.  

    12                    One of the real problems with this law, in my

    13           opinion, is that it gives the wrong signal to parents.  I

    14           think it gives a signal to parents that the Federal

    15           Government has stepped in and taken care of the problem of

    16           inappropriate material on the Internet, so parents don't need

    17           to worry.  

    18                    In fact, parents do need to worry.  Even with the

    19           Government's tagging proposal, if parents don't go to the

    20           trouble of acquiring and using parental software devices, all

    21           of that material will be available to their children despite

    22           this act.  That's one thing I hope can come out of the

    23           publicity surrounding this case is that parents will learn

    24           that they do have available to them very effective parental

    25           control devices, but they have to use them.


                    


                                                                            63

     1                    This act has not taken care of the problem and if

     2           the parents don't use those devices, all the sexually

     3           explicit speech on the Internet will be available in every

     4           home in America that's connected to the Internet, despite the

     5           act.

     6                    Let me briefly say, there were some questions about

     7           facial challenge, in earlier briefs the Government seemed to

     8           take the position that we could not bring a facial challenge. 

     9           But if you look at Pages 14 through 17 of the Government's

    10           post hearing brief, the Government acknowledges that we can

    11           bring a facial challenge in at least two ways.  We're

    12           bringing a vagueness challenge and we're alleging that the

    13           act is vague in all applications, so that's appropriate as a

    14           facial challenge.

    15                    More to this point, the Government now acknowledges

    16           that we can bring a substantial over-breadth facial challenge

    17           and we have standing to do that, all we have to show is that

    18           the law is substantially over-broad.

    19                    And in answer to the question from your Honors, the

    20           two cases that discuss that are Shomburg and City of Houston,

    21           both of which say that a law is over-broad if a substantial

    22           number of its applications would be unconstitutional.

    23                    What I think we have shown is that Subsection D is

    24           substantially over-broad because in every one of its

    25           applications except for commercial speakers, it bans speech


                    


                                                                            64

     1           that is constitutionally protected for adults.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Why do you keep ignoring Subsection

     3           A which I think you also challenge?

     4                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, we do challenge it, your Honor. 

     5           We're not ignoring it, it's just that the --

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, you keep focusing on

     7           Subsection D.

     8                    MR. ENNIS:  That's right.  That's because Subsection

     9           D is the section that will affect most Internet speakers,

    10           those who want to make their speech broadly available to the

    11           world.

    12                    Subsection A is a more focused law about speakers

    13           who want to make their speech available to a much more tiny

    14           segment of the world.  We do challenge both, but the truly

    15           draconian and sweeping provision of this law is Subsection D.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  If the Government though -- and I

    17           intend to ask Mr. Coppolino about this -- the Government does

    18           say in Footnote 46 of their brief, Page 37, I think, that

    19           they have, quote, "concerns," close quote, about your

    20           standing because they argue that your worries are so far

    21           fetched, so hyperbolic as to raise these, quote, "concerns,"

    22           close quote, about your standing.  Do you want to address

    23           that?

    24                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, first of all, I think the

    25           Government is simply wrong about that, I think our concerns


                    


                                                                            65

     1           about our standing are not at all hyperbolic or far-fetched

     2           as the Compuserve incident from just two days ago would make

     3           painfully clear.

     4                    This is a law which, if you look at the text and at

     5           the conference report, makes clear it criminalizes the

     6           display of patently offensive speech that is not obscene and

     7           the law makes clear that that speech is criminalized even if

     8           it has serious value.

     9                    Therefore, all of our speakers who engage in speech

    10           that does have serious value are at risk of prosecution under

    11           this law.

    12                    Also, under the over-breadth doctrine, pure over-

    13           breadth doctrine, we would have standing under Fox to bring

    14           this challenge on behalf of those speakers whose speech did

    15           not have serious value.  So either way you look at it, I

    16           think there's no standing issue in this case.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, it's certainly true that the

    18           Government has said consistently that -- and of course it

    19           never filed a motion as to standing and it was assured to me

    20           when we were talking about the stipulations that the

    21           Government had no standing concerns, but that Footnote 46

    22           raised my eyebrows a little bit and that's why I raised it

    23           with you.

    24                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, let me make a footnote point to

    25           that is that not only have we brought an extraordinarily


                    


                                                                            66

     1           broad coalition of plaintiff groups representing truly

     2           virtually all of the mainstream media publication and

     3           computer entities in America.  Those groups have sued also on

     4           behalf of their patrons, their subscribers and their users. 

     5           The librarians are also suing on behalf of their patrons and

     6           members.  America On Line is suing on behalf of its

     7           subscribers.

     8                    So we're suing on behalf of millions of speakers on

     9           the Internet.  Many of those speakers speak to news groups,

    10           list serves, IRC chat rooms, and it's quite likely that some

    11           of the speech they engage in would not have serious value

    12           under the Government's definition. 

    13                    So we're also speaking on behalf, we're bringing

    14           this suit on behalf of speech that does not have serious

    15           value.  Accordingly, we have standing for that third reason

    16           as well.

    17                    I'd like, if I could, to make one final point and

    18           then reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think you've used most of your

    20           time, but go ahead.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, you've reserved 15 minutes for

    22           rebuttal. 

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But we'll see -- we'll hear you on

    24           rebuttal.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And you ten, right.


                    


                                                                            67

     1                    MR. ENNIS:  Do I still have some time left?

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, you have five minutes.

     3                    MR. ENNIS:  Let me make one brief point.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And a substantial amount of your

     5           initial time.

     6                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes.  The Government suggests that the

     7           act should not be struck down because the act in combination

     8           with user blocking software would be more effective than

     9           either alone.  There are several problems with that argument. 

    10           First, as I think we have shown, this act does nothing,

    11           literally nothing or at most only a marginal amount to

    12           protect children from inappropriate speech that would not

    13           already be done as a result of market forces and end user

    14           software even in the absence of the act.  And that marginal

    15           benefit comes at the expense of suppressing constitutionally

    16           protected speech for adults.  So the act violates --

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That implicates a factual issue as

    18           to how frequently one might -- well, a child is likely to

    19           inadvertently find speech that was intended to be suppressed

    20           by this statute.

    21                    What is your understanding of, given all the

    22           evidence that we saw here, of the frequency of what the facts

    23           show as to the frequency of an inadvertent coming across

    24           that--

    25                    MR. ENNIS:  I think the evidence on that is clear


                    


                                                                            68

     1           and I think Congress agreed.  The Government's expert, Howard

     2           Schmidt, testified in court that, quote, "The odds are slim

     3           that someone would come across a sexually explicit site by

     4           accident."

     5                    Congress in fact found in the act in one of its

     6           findings that the interactive computer services, as the name

     7           suggests, the word interactive, "offer users a great deal of

     8           control over the information that they receive as well as the

     9           potential for even greater control in the future as

    10           technology develops."

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, now we saw a few examples

    12           presented by the Government's witnesses where that was

    13           likely.  What I have yet to see is somebody testify as to

    14           how, beside the very slim, how frequently that could occur

    15           because obviously it can occur.

    16                    MR. ENNIS:  It obviously can occur and --

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  We saw it in the Jasmine example.

    18                    MR. ENNIS:  Yeah, it obviously can occur.  We don't

    19           take the position that it is impossible to be surprised by

    20           what comes up on your computer screen.

    21                    We do take the position and have all testified to

    22           this effect, Bill Burrington testified to this effect, that

    23           in interactive computer services, unlike broadcast TV or

    24           radio, the speaker, I mean the listener makes an affirmative

    25           choice of where they are going to go and they have to select


                    


                                                                            69

     1           where they're going to go.

     2                    You don't turn on your computer and sexually

     3           explicit images pop on your screen.  You turn on your

     4           computer and you have to select where you want to go to get

     5           there.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is the Government entitled to

     7           prevent a child who wants to go into sexually active material

     8           from being able to do so?

     9                    MR. ENNIS:  Regardless of the parents' wishes?

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mm-hmm.

    11                    MR. ENNIS:  I think that's a very difficult

    12           question, your Honor.  I think as a constitutional matter if

    13           Congress wanted to have as an interest and to exercise a

    14           parents' patri interest in protecting child-- minors from

    15           access to material, even if their parents thought it was

    16           appropriate for their children, it could conceivably have

    17           such an interest.  It would raise very serious constitutional

    18           questions in my mind, some of which are noted in the fabulous

    19           opinion by your Honor.

    20                    But the important point here is, is that Congress

    21           has given us no reason whatsoever to think that that is the

    22           interest underlying this act.  To the contrary, in this act

    23           Congress found as a fact that its objective in the text of

    24           the act was, quote, "To empower parents to restrict their

    25           children's access to objectionable or inappropriate on-line


                    


                                                                            70

     1           material" and the conference report is even clearer.

     2                    The conference report confirms, quote, "The

     3           important Federal policy of empowering parents to determine

     4           the content of communications their children receive."

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Isn't there evidence on the record

     6           that there are a great number of possibilities for people

     7           under 18 to access the Internet outside of the home?  There

     8           are lots -- there's lots of evidence --

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Internet cafes.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, but even if little children

    11           don't go to cafes --

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Libraries.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- at libraries, et cetera,

    14           schools.

    15                    MR. ENNIS:  Schools.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, and where -- and you also

    17           assume in your argument and in your brief very knowledgeable

    18           parents, parents who know how to, assuming they have a

    19           computer in the house, who will know how to contact the

    20           entities that will be able to help them in putting things

    21           like Surfwatch on.  

    22                    And I'm not sure how realistic that is in today's

    23           world.  I mean we have children who don't know about birth

    24           control, who aren't told by their parents about AIDS, because

    25           we have a whole substrata of our society in which parents are


                    


                                                                            71

     1           unwilling or unable to give this information.  So how can you

     2           make the assumption that we can rely on parents for this kind

     3           of protection?

     4                    MR. ENNIS:  Well --

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And do we have to?

     6                    MR. ENNIS:  Two responses, your Honor.  Your final

     7           question is yes, we do have to.  If parents do not act

     8           responsibly, if parents don't do what they can do, nothing in

     9           this act will protect children from inappropriate material,

    10           nothing.

    11                    But the two answers I'd like to give are first, I

    12           respectfully disagree with your Honor.  I think the testimony

    13           by Ann Duvall, the testimony by Bill Burrington was clear

    14           that it is very easy for parents to use the parental control

    15           devices like Surfwatch, Surfwatch Manager, the America On

    16           Line Compuserve Project Parental Control devices, it's really

    17           quite easy.  Any parent that has a computer can almost

    18           certainly use those devices.

    19                    Second, if parents can't figure out how to use those

    20           devices then that is a problem for the Government as well

    21           because the Government's whole idea about tagging or

    22           registering speech can't work unless the parents have the

    23           capacity to use that end-user software.  So if it's a

    24           problem, it's a problem for the act, not a problem for our

    25           case.


                    


                                                                            72

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Last question, the same question I

     2           asked Mr. Hansen.  Senator Exon and Senator Coates give you

     3           the pen to write child of CDA, do you give it back to them or

     4           do you write something?

     5                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, my first answer would be exactly

     6           what Mr. Hansen answered, wait a decent interval, let the

     7           marketplace work, especially since Congress made findings of

     8           fact that it wanted to preserve a vibrant, free market in the

     9           Internet, quote, "unfettered by Government regulation."  Let

    10           the market work for a while and see if you even need any

    11           governmental intervention of this nature whatsoever.

    12                    But if I were pushed to try to come up with a

    13           different law I think there are many things Congress could

    14           have considered that would have narrowed the scope of the

    15           law, in answer to Judge Sloviter's question, without even

    16           thinking about the affirmative safe harbor defenses.

    17                    If Congress was truly concerned about commercial

    18           pornography it could have written a much narrower law that

    19           only criminalized the display to minors of truly sexually

    20           explicit material. 

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But those laws already exist.

    22                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, for obscenity it does, but they

    23           could have gone down one notch and tried that.  They could

    24           have made clear that speech with serious value is not

    25           criminalized, they could have done that.


                    


                                                                            73

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So you disagree with what Mr. Hansen

     2           said about the medium specific aspect here?

     3                    MR. ENNIS:  Oh, no, no, no, not at all.  The reason

     4           that this very broad coalition of plaintiff groups is before

     5           the Court today is precisely to emphasize the point that this

     6           medium of communication truly is unlike any other that has

     7           ever gone before it and that the appropriate First Amendment

     8           standards of review that this Court must develop to govern

     9           regulation of this new medium of communication have to take

    10           those characteristics into consideration.

    11                    One of the principal characteristics is it is a

    12           truly global medium, which Congress forgot about it.  It is

    13           not as if patently offensive speech that's posted abroad has

    14           to come through a Customs Office checkpoint before it reaches

    15           American homes where it can be physically screened by Customs

    16           officers.  Everything that's posted abroad is instantly

    17           available in every home in America, this is a global

    18           communications medium.

    19                    I can suggest a few other ways of narrowing the

    20           statute that Congress could have considered.  For example,

    21           the Government has made much in its evidence about the so-

    22           called teaser ads by commercial providers of sexually

    23           explicit speech who have teaser ads and then charge with

    24           credit cards to actually get into their Web sites.

    25                    If that was really Congress' concern, Congress could


                    


                                                                            74

     1           have crafted a much different statute designed to regulate

     2           advertising.  Now, in my opinion there would be very, very

     3           serious constitutional problems with regulation of

     4           advertising on the Internet, but they would be of a different

     5           order of magnitude because they would be judged under the

     6           intermediate standard of review, not under strict scrutiny

     7           because commercial speech is judged on an intermediate

     8           standard of review.  That's another narrower thing Congress

     9           could have done.

    10                    There are many ways Congress could have narrowed

    11           this law, the most important of which would be to take out

    12           the word speech available to minors.  That basically bans all

    13           speech.  Congress could have said, passed a law that said

    14           before you engage in patently offensive speech on the

    15           Internet you should give fair warning that your speech is

    16           patently offensive.  Then all these tagging defenses would

    17           make some sense because you would be giving fair warning. 

    18           That's a different scheme that Congress, I think probably

    19           would be an unconstitutional scheme, but it would certainly

    20           be a narrower scheme than the one Congress adopted.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It doesn't help to suggest what you

    22           think is unconstitutional now, does it?

    23                    (Laughter.)

    24                    MR. ENNIS:  I was just trying to respond to Judge

    25           Dalzell's question.  If I were --


                    


                                                                            75

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The answer may be -- I mean if you

     2           really think it -- that there's nothing that Congress could

     3           have done constitutionally.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's okay to say that, Mr. Ennis.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I mean I'm not sure that's right --

     6                    (Laughter.)

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- but I can't see how it helps us

     8           to suggest statutes that you would later challenge.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because for sure you wouldn't want

    10           to repeat what's happened with dial-a-porn, would you?  That

    11           is to say where you have ten years of litigation over the

    12           subject?

    13                    MR. ENNIS:  No, I think that's right and I think

    14           that's precisely why Congress specifically authorized a

    15           facial challenge in this case because there's allegedly

    16           history makes clear that Congress did not want to wait for

    17           ten years to find out whether they've got a valid law or not.

    18                    And if it's limited to an as-applied challenge, then

    19           you're into years of litigation about the constitutional

    20           scope of the law.  That's why I think Congress invited a

    21           broad facial challenge to this law.

    22                    Let me finish the point I said was the final point I

    23           was going to make about this combination.  The Government's

    24           argument that the less drastic alternative of end-user

    25           software coupled with the act would be more effective than


                    


                                                                            76

     1           either alone.  That argument is flatly inconsistent with

     2           current law and would basically wipe out the less restrictive

     3           alternative requirement of strict scrutiny because it is

     4           almost always the case that a combination of the Government

     5           prohibition and the less restrictive alternative together

     6           would be more effective than either alone.

     7                    In the Bolger case, for example, the combination of

     8           the Government prohibition on unsolicited mailings when

     9           combined with the less drastic alternative of parental

    10           supervision of incoming mails would surely be more effective

    11           than either alone, but the Supreme Court struck down that

    12           governmental prohibition and relied exclusively and solely on

    13           parental supervision of what their children would receive in

    14           the mail.  That's the appropriate response for this case as

    15           well.

    16                    Thank you.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, we will -- go ahead.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We will recess for 15 minutes,

    19           please.

    20                    (Court in recess; 11:07 to 11:28 o'clock a.m.)

    21                    THE COURT CLERK:  Court is now in session, please be

    22           seated.

    23                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Good morning, your Honors.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Good morning, Mr. Coppolino.

    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honors, just first by way of a


                    


                                                                            77

     1           couple of procedural points, whatever the Court's wishes are

     2           in terms of our having rebuttal time, if you would permit us

     3           I would reserve ten minutes if you could --

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Why would you have rebuttal time?

     5                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, that's -- if you want them to

     6           have  the last word then that's fine with me.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, that's not the question as to

     8           whether we want them to have the last word, you didn't call

     9           it, this is not an appeal, you didn't cross-appeal.

    10                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I understand.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And I didn't understand the whole

    12           thing about surrebuttal.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  There's no counterclaim, at least

    14           that I've seen.

    15                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Okay, then forget that then.  I

    16           think -- 

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Good try.

    18                    (Laughter.)

    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:   I had to try.

    20                    That being the case, Mr. Baron and I will divide the

    21           argument essentially along the lines that Mr. Hansen and Mr.

    22           Ennis divided it.  I do expect that I will cross over a bit

    23           into Mr. Ennis' area to talk about the safe harbor defense

    24           concerning credit cards and access codes and the parental

    25           control software is the least restrictive alternative with


                    


                                                                            78

     1           respect to that.

     2                    Given the amount of time we have, you know, I would

     3           expect to go for about an hour on my time and then Mr. Baron

     4           would have about an hour thereafter.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You will forgive us if we don't

     6           keep in our minds what the break of the -- of you both is and

     7           if we ask you questions that -- I'd rather you not say well,

     8           Mr. Baron's going to handle that.  It's the frustration of

     9           having two arguers rather than having one that you can do

    10           unless it's something that really Mr. Baron promises to get

    11           to.

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes.  Well, the only area, I think

    13           it's a very discrete area having to do with the defenses for

    14           the non-commercial providers concerning tagging, labeling--

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.

    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  -- registering, Dr. Olsen's areas,

    17           there's some crossover.  And I'll, if I feel like he could

    18           have the better handle on it, I'll just --

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    20                    MR. COPPOLINO:  -- so indicate.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Are you finished the procedure?

    22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes, I am, your Honor.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Good.  Mr. Coppolino, I would like

    24           to know because I'm not satisfied that I fully understand at

    25           this point what is the Government's position as to what the


                    


                                                                            79

     1           statute, A and D, let's leave aside C, what the statute

     2           covers.

     3                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I take it by your question, your

     4           Honor, you are specifically asking about the indecency

     5           standard, what types of speech it covers.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, I'm asking about -- that's my

     7           second question which is whether they really are the same

     8           thing, but what do you understand -- I read your brief very

     9           carefully, I even indexed it all myself, no law clerks, what

    10           do you --

    11                    (Laughter.)

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- what is your position as to what

    13           is covered by the statute?

    14                    MR. COPPOLINO:  The statute, I -- I would say on its

    15           face covers indecent, that is patently offensive

    16           communications over a telecommunications device in 223(A) and

    17           an interactive computer service in 223(D).  And therefore it

    18           could cover communications across various media, Web sites,

    19           Usenet groups and so on that might be within that standard of

    20           patently offensive.  So --

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And is that the way we have to read

    22           the statute?

    23                    MR. COPPOLINO:   I don't think that's the way you

    24           necessarily have to construe it and I think as you may

    25           discern from our brief an important point we would make to


                    


                                                                            80

     1           the Court, principally in connection with the substantial

     2           over-breadth argument is that if there are some applications

     3           that give the cause concern that the Court would have to look

     4           to whether the plainly legitimate sweep of the statute is

     5           substantial or whether the applications that you consider

     6           might be unconstitutional are substantial in comparison to

     7           the plainly legitimate sweep.

     8                    I'm jumping ahead a bit, but --

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, well, but I think we have to

    10           get, because everything else will follow, I assume everything

    11           else follows from what you claim is covered.

    12                    Now, do you claim -- I'm going to ask you a series

    13           of questions if my colleagues will permit because -- do you

    14           claim that A and D, the patently offensive and the indecent

    15           provisions are the same?

    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes, I do, your Honor.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, then I want to know if that's

    18           so, I mean how can you do that in light of the language?  For

    19           example, D talks in terms of communications that describe

    20           sexual or excretory activities or organs.  Is that anywhere

    21           in A?

    22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  It is not specifically defined in A. 

    23           Here is my position on that --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.

    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  -- point, your Honor.  Our position


                    


                                                                            81

     1           is that as the courts have construed the term indecent or

     2           indecency, that the meaning for that term, the standard, if

     3           you will, has been communications which in context describe

     4           sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently

     5           offensive way.

     6                    In Pacifica case, for example, the standard, the

     7           statute at issue specifically  used the word "indecent." 

     8           That's all that it had.  And the FCC interpreted the standard

     9           to mean patently offensive communications of sexual or

    10           excretory activities in every other case that has interpreted

    11           the decency standard has interpreted it to mean that.  So

    12           that's our position.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, but --

    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay, you have the same -- I know

    15           you have  the same question, I guess.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Go ahead, you go ahead.

    17                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  There's -- there's no other act

    18           though quite like this one, is there, where you have in the

    19           one section the indecent and in another totally different

    20           section dealing with a totally different subject because

    21           you're not dealing with telecommunications in D, you're

    22           dealing with interactive computer.  You have a totally

    23           different prohibition, okay?  So there's nothing quite like

    24           this before, has there?

    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No, there's nothing quite like this


                    


                                                                            82

     1           statute before, no, your Honor.

     2                    There is -- there is --

     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I guess that's a --

     4                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I don't think it's totally different

     5           though, Judge.  I would say that, as we had a separate brief

     6           on this issue of what is the difference between

     7           telecommunica-- telecommunications device and interactive

     8           computer service and I --

     9                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  But the statute itself says

    10           something, doesn't it, or did I misread that, that the

    11           interactive computer is not telecommunications?

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  It's not, it's not

    13           telecommunications device, but the point I was going to make

    14           is that a transmission of a communication all through the use

    15           of a modem, say, over a computer system would be covered by

    16           A, and therefore we don't think it's that different.

    17                    I recognize there are some -- there are some

    18           legislative craftsmanship problem here in that they didn't,

    19           didn't have a separate section which says definition indecent

    20           or so on, but I think there is so much case law --

    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  You might not even have to have

    22           that if you didn't have two different, plain different words

    23           there.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But doesn't the conference report

    25           make it clear that they do have the same meaning?


                    


                                                                            83

     1                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I think so, your Honor.  I think--

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because the conference report makes

     3           it absolutely clear that these terms are taken from Pacifica

     4           and Sable, doesn't it?

     5                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, I think it does, it referred

     6           to the definition of indecency as its been con-- as its been

     7           construed in Pacifica and Sable.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, I want the Government's

     9           position.  I mean we'll get each other's, yeah, afterward.

    10                    MR. COPPOLINO:  That is our position.  That is our

    11           position, that when we are talking about the indecency

    12           standard in 223(A), the word "indecent" or the patently

    13           offensive provision in 223(D), we are talking about the

    14           indecency standard as it has been construed and understood by

    15           the Courts from Pacifica, Sable, the Dial-A-Porn cases and so

    16           on.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So you want us to write into A the

    18           words describing sexual or excretory activities or organs?

    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, yes, your Honor.

    20                    THE COURT:  But they're not in there.

    21                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yeah, I -- I don't think that is an

    22           enormous task of statutory construction based on our

    23           representation as well as the legislative history but yes --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well --

    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  -- I think you should interpret


                    


                                                                            84

     1           indecent in A as patently offensive descriptions of sexual or

     2           excretory activities.  I don't know how else it would be --

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Does that give notice to the

     4           required notice in a criminal statute to all the people who

     5           may be subject to this?

     6                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I think it -- I think it certainly

     7           would give substantial notice because obviously as part of

     8           the process we have a legislative process and we have a

     9           process whereby the Federal Courts undertake a constitutional

    10           interpretation of it and I think that that interpretation

    11           just on that point would be fully consistent with a broad

    12           array of case law discussing the indecency standard and what

    13           that standard specifically means, particularly where I don't

    14           think there's any disagreement between the parties and I

    15           don't think that there is any case law to suggest that there

    16           would be some different meaning to the word indecent in

    17           isolation.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  And you want us also, as I

    19           read your brief, to read the statute to have a built-in

    20           exception for works of value.  Let me -- that's a sort of a

    21           paraphrase of what your brief says.  Is that correct?

    22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I'm sorry, I can't really agree with

    23           that characterization, your Honor, it's too broad an issue. 

    24           And if I could just try to explain it, I would --

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Sure, I would certainly like to


                    


                                                                            85

     1           hear that -- keep to that in light of the legislative

     2           history-- 

     3                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes, I will do that.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- which says we won't accept such

     5           a exemption.

     6                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes, I understand, I understand your

     7           question and let me try to get to it as directly as I can.  I

     8           think that obviously the first major line of attacks by the

     9           plaintiffs in trying to demonstrate that the statute

    10           effectively bans speech is not only that it's over-broad

    11           across applications but the indecency standard covers a broad

    12           array of speech.

    13                    And while arguing at the same time that we are

    14           trying to narrowly construe it, that we have equated it to

    15           pornography, that is really not what we have attempted to do. 

    16           We are asking the Court to construe that standard in the

    17           context in which it's been applied by Congress and upheld by

    18           the courts.

    19                    For example, it has been applied by Congress in

    20           regulating Dial-A-Porn, it has been applied by Congress in

    21           regulating cable and leased access television to materials

    22           that clearly constitute the type of sexually explicit

    23           materials that one could characterize as pornography.

    24                    And our point is that it's not simply anything about

    25           sex or anything with an expletive, the parameters are fairly


                    


                                                                            86

     1           specific.  It has to first concern sexual or excretory

     2           activities, not just any kind but patently or obviously

     3           offensive material.  Now, that can include pornography.  It

     4           can also include what we would consider to be shocking,

     5           offensive or vulgar textual discussions such as were at issue

     6           in the Pacifica case and we're not suggesting otherwise.

     7                    Certainly the language on a number of the cites that

     8           we provided to you have that type of language, but I --

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Let's put some flesh on it because

    10           it, in terms of what the Government's position is because I

    11           share Chief Judge Sloviter's befuddlement on this point.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I'm not sure I would describe

    13           myself -- 

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, all right, then I will

    15           describe it for myself as that.

    16                    (Laughter.)

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I asked counsel on the other side

    18           about the Merrill Hansen decision, okay?  If the Merrill

    19           Hansen dialogue between those two disc-jockeys about Jim

    20           Baker's alleged rape of Jessica Hahn, if that had taken place

    21           on the Internet, okay, would that be indecent under the CDA

    22           and therefore subject those two gentlemen plus the station to

    23           criminal sanctions?

    24                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I think if you -- I re-read the case

    25           after you had referenced it and I think that is probably the


                    


                                                                            87

     1           hardest case, I've read all of the FCC materials that you had

     2           talked about because it was obviously a very explicit

     3           description, but then they stopped and said hey, this is

     4           serious, this woman was being raped.

     5                    And I would say to the Court that in the broadcast

     6           context, as I think we've made clear, the standard is much

     7           less tolerant.  Judge Sloviter explained this in a fabulous

     8           case, in that context you're going to get away with an awful

     9           lot less and your First Amendment freedoms are more limited.

    10                    So I don't think I can say that that discussion

    11           would necessarily be indecent, although prior to the point

    12           where they got to, hey, wait a minute, maybe we shouldn't be

    13           making jokes about this, this is a serious situation, it was

    14           a fairly explicit discussion.

    15                    But I'd like to make this point to the Court in

    16           respect to the FCC adjudication because I think that is

    17           helpful in trying to understand the standard.  Even in the

    18           area of broadcast where First Amendment freedoms are most

    19           limited and where there is the least tolerance, I think that

    20           the FCC decisions reflect a very serious intent to limit the

    21           indecency standard to patently offensive and shocking

    22           materials that are taken, for example, out of context.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But that's why I'm concerned about

    24           the Hansen case.  We have 94 U.S. Attorneys, I think, at

    25           least 94 cause there's 94 districts, okay, that at least one


                    


                                                                            88

     1           of them or one of your colleagues in Washington such as the

     2           gentleman who was in recent contact with Compuserve will look

     3           at Hansen or the language of this and say let's convene a

     4           Grand Jury.

     5                    Now, you know, if a party hears the words Grand Jury

     6           convened about me, it will really ruin their day, wouldn't

     7           you agree?

     8                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes, I --

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So that the fact that a jury later

    10           on, that a jury later on will say oh, acquitted, that's not a

    11           lot of comfort, is it?

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, I think that we cannot

    13           provide assurance that there might not be a prosecutor that's

    14           going to take the most absurd case or very extreme case and I

    15           think that in assessing --

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is this an absurd case?

    17                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Hansen, I mean, this is the Federal

    19           Communications Commission did this.  Did they do an absurd

    20           thing?

    21                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I indicated just a moment ago that I

    22           felt that the standard would be tighter in the broadcast

    23           context and that in many other cases that they have decided

    24           in the broadcast context it is very clear that they are

    25           focusing on patently offensive stuff taken out of context.


                    


                                                                            89

     1                    But to answer your question, in the context of the

     2           facial challenge I think the Court has to construe the

     3           indecency standard in a manner consistent with how it's been

     4           applied by the Congress and the courts.  That's not to say

     5           that there aren't going to be hard cases.  Those hard cases

     6           should not take the whole statute down, they should simply be

     7           left for admittedly a difficult as applied challenge.

     8                    But we can show, I believe it's fair to say, that

     9           the indecency standard as it has been applied and construed

    10           covers a fairly narrow category of speech.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I still don't understand whether

    12           that narrow category of speech covers work that some people

    13           would consider to be of value.  Take, for example, the play

    14           that was in two parts on Broadway about AIDS.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Lost in America?

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The two --

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Angels in America.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Angels in America.  Now, a lot of

    19           people might be offended by that -- leave aside Shakespeare

    20           and leave aside Chaucer which we know from the book content

    21           and leave aside "Catcher In The Rye" which we know from the

    22           print media are considered offensive in some media and go to

    23           a more contemporary type of literature that some people would

    24           think is serious and some people would think is

    25           objectionable.


                    


                                                                            90

     1                    If that were printed in, you know, print on the

     2           Internet, Mr. -- Pittsburgh Library --

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Dunninberger (ph.).

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, would that be covered or

     5           would there be a built-in non-specified defense that says

     6           this is a serious work?

     7                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Two points, your Honor.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.

     9                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Our point is that yes, material that

    10           might be found indecent might also be considered to have

    11           serious value.  The plaintiff's position seems to be is that

    12           indecency covers all works that have serious value and that's

    13           where really we are disagreeing.  We -- because I don't

    14           believe that's necessarily the case as you parse the

    15           standards in the obscenity and indecency area that you have

    16           to conclude, as they have, that indecency necessarily

    17           includes serious material and necessarily excludes material

    18           that has prurient appeal.  That's where our disagreement is.

    19                    The answer to your question is yes, it's possible

    20           that something that is serious in some way could be indecent. 

    21           Our point with respect to the --

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And it certainly deals with sexual,

    23           I saw half of it, sexual or excretory activities or organs.

    24                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes, but our point with respect to

    25           plaintiff's materials, first of all, is that what they have


                    


                                                                            91

     1           presented in context in its full context is -- is serious

     2           material that ought not to be found and should not be found

     3           indecent.  And I have to say to your Honor that if you're

     4           just going to talk about a play on AIDS, the whole play in

     5           context, it has serious value.

     6                    If you're going to talk about, as in one of the FCC

     7           cases, taking specific stuff out and putting that out there

     8           and making it available, then the context is completely

     9           changed.  So it's very difficult to answer the question well,

    10           is all serious -- is all serious work covered by the

    11           indecency standard.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But that's not the question.  That

    13           may be their question, but that's not my question.  My

    14           question is does the -- and we're not bound by anything that

    15           the plaintiffs say, that may also be extreme.

    16                    My question is simply as a matter of notifica-- one

    17           is a matter of the First Amendment and two is a matter of

    18           notification because it's a criminal statute.  To the world

    19           out there what does this statute read or reasonably read  to

    20           those people so that if somebody wants to send somebody else

    21           a paragraph or a scene from a contemporary play, is that

    22           person and the other person is 17, is that covered by the

    23           statute?  And I still don't have a yes or a no from you.

    24                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, the problem is I don't know

    25           that I can say yes or no to a categorical question that is


                    


                                                                            92

     1           serious material covered because the application of the

     2           indecency standard depends on the specific communication and

     3           its context.

     4                    I got in -- we kind of got into this thicket for two

     5           reasons: one is they're coming in saying that anything having

     6           to do with sex, whether it's a reference in Bible, the Bible

     7           or Shakespeare, breast cancer, breast feeding, so on--

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Leave them out of it and just --

     9                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Fine, okay.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- talk to the three of us at this

    11           point.  

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I think the material --

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And the three of us want to -- I

    14           think the three of us want to know how broadly this statute

    15           reads.

    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Then our position would be  that the

    17           statute should apply to non-obscene patently offensive

    18           material, sexual -- concerning sexual and excretory

    19           activities of the nature that Congress has indicated that it

    20           is targeting, namely the sexually explicit sites on the

    21           Internet and of the nature that Congress has targeted and the

    22           courts have recognized in other cases such as Dial-A-Porn and

    23           the Act Two -- the Act Three in the Alliance case, materials

    24           of that nature.  

    25                    Clearly, your Honor, I think it's fair to say that


                    


                                                                            93

     1           the target of the indecency standard has been materials with

     2           very little value, with significantly little, with

     3           significant or --

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But who determines that, the 94 U.S.

     5           Attorneys?

     6                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I think it starts in the first

     7           instance and in the face of a vagueness challenge here with

     8           the Court construing the standard as it has been applied by

     9           Congress and as it has been reasonably applied by the Courts

    10           who have considered similar cases.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But they're not criminal, by and

    12           large.

    13                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, by and large.  The Dial-A-Porn

    14           statute is a criminal statute with a regulatory overlay but,

    15           yes, they are predominately not criminal.  But I think that

    16           again I would start with the point that this is not a

    17           completely open-ended standard, there are parameters here. 

    18           First of all, you have to have sexual or excretory activities

    19           or organs.  That's minimum that has to be in the

    20           communication.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Even though A doesn't so state?

    22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, yes, I understand.  Well, I

    23           understand that, your Honor, but there's nothing --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I mean you're asking us to be the

    25           activist Judges that Congress ex-- that some members of


                    


                                                                            94

     1           Congress excoriate because you're asking us really, Mr.

     2           Coppolino, to rewrite the statute.

     3                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, I --

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  To put words into the statute that

     5           aren't there.  And at least I want to know clearly what words

     6           you think we ought to put in and your brief suggests, for

     7           example, we should put in prurient, you know, that --

     8           commercial, the kind of -- that it's really intended to hit

     9           what already is being hit.  And what I'm trying to find out

    10           is what more is in this statute than in, already in 18 USC.

    11                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Right, your Honor, I --

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And I know your position is

    13           difficult, especially when I come at you like -- when all

    14           three of us come at you like that, but -- but we really want

    15           to understand.

    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  And I understand and I'm not --

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And we know it comes like you say

    18           with the overlay of constitutionality and Congress has sorted

    19           out, we know all that.  And you know it's very rare that we

    20           declare a statute unconstitutional.

    21                    MR. COPPOLINO:  You don't have to rewrite the

    22           statute, you don't have to be activist Federal Judges

    23           legislating and I'm not asking you to do that.  With respect

    24           to the indecency standard, I think that's a fairly simple

    25           task of statutory construction to say that the word indecent


                    


                                                                            95

     1           means what every court that has considered an indecency

     2           challenge has understood it to mean.  That's our view, at

     3           least, that it's fairly simple to do that.

     4                    With respect to the over-breadth issue, the over-

     5           breadth issue goes to whether or not the statute, the

     6           statute's potentially unconstitutional applications are

     7           substantial in comparison to its plainly legitimate sweep.

     8                    Our point on that is that it's plainly legitimate

     9           sweep -- 

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is what?

    11                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Is enormous and is very substantial

    12           and substantially outweighs what might be considered to be

    13           potential problem areas, due to potential problem areas.  And

    14           let me --

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What is its plainly legitimate

    16           sweep that is not already covered by the two provisions in 18

    17           USC?

    18                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, the plainly legitimate

    19           sweep is --

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That is not already covered.

    21                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes.  18 USC does not cover indecent

    22           materials, it covers obscenity and child pornography.  And

    23           this statute extends that to materials that would fall within

    24           the indecency standard.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And what is indecent?


                    


                                                                            96

     1                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, your Honor, let me go back to

     2           the point and try to explain it this way because --

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And not only what is indecent,

     4           where does it have to be viewed as indecent, in other words,

     5           in what community?  Would you take those two questions --

     6                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yeah, I think I can deal with that

     7           one first.  There's no in-- I mean I think that the indecency

     8           standard is a standard that will be judged on a community

     9           basis and I think that that --

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What community, you mean local

    11           community?

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, yeah, where the communication

    13           is at issue.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Where the communication what?

    15                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Is at issue.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, is that not a problem when

    17           you're dealing with something that comes across the entire

    18           United States?  Leave aside the rest of the world, I

    19           understand your position that you can only deal with what's

    20           here and, you know, let's not worry about what's there, you

    21           know, that's true, I don't have to worry about what they're

    22           singing in Paris.

    23                    But the United States is so diverse, what goes in

    24           Philadelphia, as cosmopolitan as Philadelphia is, may not 

    25           go-- where are you from?  -- Lancaster.


                    


                                                                            97

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Lancaster.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  May not go --

     3                    (Laughter.)

     4                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  For the record, that's spelled 

     5           L-a-n-c-a-s-t-e-r.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, seriously, so what -- and are

     7           we on the same -- and we're all in the same district, in the

     8           same Eastern District no less.  What -- and Lancaster is

     9           where the Amish are?

    10                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Right.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And "Witness" and --

    12                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  And Mennonites.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mennonites.  What -- and I know

    14           we're taking your time, we're going to give you time to

    15           answer.

    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No, that's fine, I want to answer

    17           your questions.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What community is it when somebody

    19           sends something over the Chat News that I could access,

    20           assuming I knew how, and that he could access?

    21                    MR. COPPOLINO:  The answer, I think, to the question

    22           is, it is a problem if you construe the indecency standards

    23           as the way plaintiffs have, that someone might be offended,

    24           for example, by a serious discussion of prison rape or safe

    25           sex.


                    


                                                                            98

     1                    But if the indecency standard is properly understood

     2           to be applicable to the types of materials Congress has

     3           intended to cover, then the disagreements between communities

     4           are going to be at the margins.  Some communities like New

     5           York, for example, will consider the movie, "Deep Throat,"

     6           not to be obscene but merely indecent.  Philadelphia or

     7           Lancaster may have a different view of that.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, Philadelphia would be with New

     9           York but Lancaster would --

    10                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Would not.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- might be somewhere else.

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I recognize that, your Honor, but

    13           first of all we're in the ballpark of that kind of material

    14           in --

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, wait a minute now.  You just

    16           say we're in the ballpark.  One of the amici put before us a

    17           Web site of the University of California that has an exhibit

    18           of the University of California that has an exhibit of Edward

    19           Weston and Robert Maplethorpe photographs and it has two

    20           examples of those photographs.  The Maplethorpe photograph is

    21           the depiction of a man with an erect penis, okay, and that's

    22           the subject of that photograph, quite obvious.

    23                    Now, we don't have to speculate.  We know in

    24           Philadelphia, because that's where the show started, the

    25           Maplethorpe show was a big hit at the Institute for


                    


                                                                            99

     1           Contemporary Art but when it went to Cincinnati, in that

     2           community people were very upset by it.

     3                    Now, is the University of California at Riverside, I

     4           think it was, who has that on its site, is the University of

     5           California at Riverside subject to prosecution under the CDA

     6           in Cincinnati?

     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  There's no indication, your

     8           Honor, that the standard is simply going to be that you're

     9           subject to prosecution where your site is.  So I'd like to be

    10           able to tell you that they're not exposed to liability where

    11           that material can be downloaded, but what I want to come back

    12           to you though and in connection with the Maplethorpe example

    13           is that again you have -- you have steered me to now two very

    14           tough cases which I would suggest to the Court not be the

    15           cases which bring the statute down on a facial basis.

    16                    It is conceivable that that Maplethorpe picture of a

    17           man with an erect penis might in some communities, in

    18           Lancaster or in other communities it might be considered more

    19           conservative, might be a problem because it is certainly a

    20           depiction of a sexual organ, we can agree to that.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It fits the literal definition, we

    22           don't have to speculate.  We know in Cincinnati that in that

    23           community they find that a patently offensive depiction of a

    24           sexual organ, so it is verbatim in D.  So the U.S. Attorney

    25           for the Southern District of Ohio indicts the University of


                    


                                                                           100

     1           California at Riverside?

     2                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, big, big leap there, your

     3           Honor.  I mean this is the statute which just doesn't say if

     4           you have this communication or this image on your -- on your

     5           Internet you have no -- you have no defenses.

     6                    The point I would make is that --

     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, no, no, no, but he's saying,

     8           he didn't say it about defenses though, but do they indict?

     9           That's what he was saying.

    10                    MR. COPPOLINO:  The point I was going to make --

    11                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  And isn't the answer yes?

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No, no, I don't think the answer's

    13           yes.  I think the point is that if you're going to have an

    14           image like that in your site, and we're getting closest to

    15           the line perhaps without going across the line to materials

    16           that aren't serious or do appeal to the prurient interest,

    17           but if you're going to have an image like that on your site

    18           and there is some risk, then there are steps that are

    19           available to you to ensure that there may not be access by

    20           minors because of the fact that there is possibility that

    21           that might be found to be indecent.

    22                    But this is the hardest case and I again would

    23           suggest that --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But we could give you, I mean I

    25           would imagine we could give you lots of hard cases.  In other


                    


                                                                           101

     1           words, we picked two but we don't have all day to stay here. 

     2           I asked a witness, if you recall, what about the Indian

     3           statues, statues of, you know, copulating, loads of different

     4           methods of copulation.  And we didn't have a chance to ask

     5           you --         

     6                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Sure.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- in those contexts.

     8                    MR. COPPOLINO:  But that is where, that is I think

     9           where we suggest to the Court that a fair, reasonable and

    10           appropriate and narrow, if you will, construction that does

    11           not involve being activists or re-writing the legislation is

    12           to -- is to recognize that the indecency standard as Congress

    13           has intended to apply it in this case, if properly applied to

    14           the types of materials that are, that have been described in

    15           the Congressional record and that we have put forward with

    16           Mr. Schmidt's materials because I think it's very clear to

    17           say, I think it's very fair to say that those are the

    18           materials that Congress had in mind.

    19                    Now --

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Schmidt's materials are, I

    21           would think, almost exclusively materials that are

    22           pornographic.

    23                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I wouldn't disagree with that.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Or obscene.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Obscene.


                    


                                                                           102

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Obscene.

     2                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I do disagree with that, but I agree

     3           they're pornographic, I don't --

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, I would think they were

     5           obscene.

     6                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Can I address that?

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, some were obscene for certain.

     8                    I mean I know it when I see it, just like Justice

     9           Stewart.

    10                    (Laughter.)

    11                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I did that, I -- but can I just

    12           address this point?  I certainly wanted to provide you

    13           examples of a range of materials that are out there and we by

    14           no means went to the far reaches of the extreme of what's

    15           easily available to you on the Internet, but we did provide

    16           somewhat of a range precisely because in some communities

    17           they may not be obscene and I wanted the Court to see

    18           examples of what those might be, given the fact --

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I can't imagine that community.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But, Mr. Coppolino, the point is in

    21           a case where you have an over-breadth challenge to a statute,

    22           it seems to me that to come back to my Maplethorpe example --

    23           the reason I keep coming back to Maplethorpe is we don't have

    24           to hypothesize anything about Maplethorpe.  We know for a

    25           fact how Mr. Maplethorpe's photographs are received in


                    


                                                                           103

     1           different communities, okay?

     2                    And you're the lawyer for the University of

     3           California.  Does the University of California at Riverside's

     4           gallery have to come to you and get an opinion and say Tony,

     5           we've got these photographs of Weston and Maplethorpe and we

     6           happen to think they're great, but are we going to get

     7           prosecuted in Cincinnati if we put this on here?  What would

     8           you tell him?

     9                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Am I the Justice Department or their

    10           lawyer?

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No, you're the lawyer for the

    12           University of California at Riverside.  What would you tell

    13           them?

    14                    MR. COPPOLINO:   I would tell them you shouldn't

    15           because as the --

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You should not put that on there?

    17                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No, you should not be prosecuted

    18           under the indecency standard because Congress has construed

    19           that, has applied and construed that standard in a fairly

    20           specific way.

    21                    However, if you are concerned there are things that

    22           you can do to protect access by  minors to that site. 

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  How?

    24                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well -- 

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because we were told that those


                    


                                                                           104

     1           images -- we were -- you know, but we were told by your

     2           expert that images that he knew of no technology to block

     3           images.  He could block words, but not images.  And that's

     4           why I keep coming back to the Maplethorpe example because

     5           they're images.

     6                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, your Honor, you can block --

     7           you can block a file, certainly, you can block a site, we've

     8           seen that.  You can block a file and you can have the image

     9           attached to the file and if the file is blocked, I believe

    10           the image would be blocked as well.

    11                    I don't think it's correct to say that images can't

    12           be, if images couldn't be blocked, America On Line's Parental

    13           Controls would not work and they specifically attempt to

    14           block down binary downloads.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Isn't the issue though one of

    16           chill?  In other words, if you're dealing with a First

    17           Amendment challenge and the university says oh, who wants to

    18           bother, who wants a lawsuit, who wants to have to come up

    19           with a defense, it's not worth it.  We're not making money

    20           out of this, this is something that we're doing.  And isn't

    21           that a concern when we're dealing with a criminal statute?  I

    22           keep coming back to the criminal statute because people are

    23           supposed to know, at least I was taught in law school and 17

    24           years on this court I've been taking the position that people

    25           are entitled to know what it is they may be prosecuted for.


                    


                                                                           105

     1                    And if these not insubstantial number of cases are

     2           at the edge and they have to keep running to their lawyers

     3           and saying where do you think this falls in a statute that

     4           doesn't say specifically the things that Mr. Coppolino who's

     5           nice but he now works for the university making more money,

     6           and so I don't know who's going to construe the statute,

     7           doesn't that present a problem and how do we deal with it?

     8                    MR. COPPOLINO:  The answer is, your Honor, again

     9           that there are parameters to the standard and this Court

    10           certainly can go a long way towards reducing the potential

    11           chill by construing the statute in a manner in which Congress

    12           has intended it to apply and in a manner in which the Courts

    13           have recognized that it has been applied.

    14                    Again, it is sexual and excretory activities that

    15           are patently offensive.  Now, we recognize with the --

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We don't know where, either,

    17           patently offensive.

    18                    MR. COPPOLINO:  We recognize that there's always the

    19           potential risk in some cases in a criminal statute with some

    20           hypothetical, but there has to be an expectation that the

    21           Government is going to apply the standard in the manner in

    22           which it is clearly intended to be applied and in a manner in

    23           which the courts have said can constitutionally be applied

    24           and we certainly are not asking the Court to re-write it, but

    25           to take this standard as it has been intended.


                    


                                                                           106

     1                    And there is one point I would like to make about

     2           this because I think my argument is not complete unless I

     3           make it.  The point that I've tried to make is that the

     4           plaintiffs construe what we have submitted as pornography,

     5           which I think is a fair characterization, but what I disagree

     6           with is that because that material appeals to the prurient

     7           interest and arguably has no serious value, it is necessarily

     8           obscene.  That is a legal determination and I think that that

     9           analysis is simply wrong.

    10                    To be obscene under the Miller test, you have to

    11           satisfy all three standards or obscenity.  And therefore it's

    12           conceivable that something could appeal to the prurient

    13           interest as these materials do but not be considered patently

    14           offensive or in some communities might have serious literary

    15           or artistic value and therefore would not be indecent, would

    16           not be obscene.

    17                    And the reason that this is important is that

    18           material that is obscene, as you know, is not legal, it can

    19           be banned entirely.  It is a very -- and therefore it is a

    20           very narrow category of speech and I think that Justice

    21           Scalia's observation in Sable is that the more narrow that

    22           category of speech of obscenity is, the more Congress needs

    23           to sweep into this, into the indecency standard this type of

    24           stuff, the kind of stuff in the Schmidt notebook.

    25                    Because if it just simply said let's limit the


                    


                                                                           107

     1           statute to obscenity, well, then a lot of that material is

     2           not going to be obscene in many communities and it would be

     3           freely available and the protection of minors, which is the

     4           Government's compelling interest, would not be served.

     5                    And this is clearly the case in a number of statutes

     6           in which Congress has tried to use the indecency standard

     7           successfully.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, you're distinguishing between

     9           pornographic and obscenity, are you making a distinction

    10           there?

    11                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, yes.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  They're not challenging, as I

    13           understand it they're not challenging the application of the

    14           statute to that which is obscene, everybody agrees to that,

    15           or that which is pornographic.  I thought I saw that.

    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No, I'm afraid  that with

    17           pornographic, your Honor, we get into a subjective term, as

    18           Mr. Hansen -- as Mr. Hansen nicely lectured me at the TRO

    19           hearing, as you can -- as you might remember, your Honor --

    20           pornography is not a legal term.

    21                    Now, I can accept the colloquial characterization of

    22           pornography is appealing to the prurient interest and lacking

    23           serious value, but I do not accept the conclusion that that

    24           is necessarily obscene.

    25                    I think a Playboy centerfold appeals to the prurient


                    


                                                                           108

     1           interest, might have some artistic value to some, clearly it

     2           appeals to the prurient interest.  I doubt it's --I doubt

     3           it's obscene.  And I think that our laws clearly reflect that

     4           understanding, that common sense understanding of where a

     5           line is between obscenity and indecency.

     6                    Obscenity is the hardcore and what is hardcore is

     7           going to vary in communities and at least one Circuit Court

     8           in the Second Circuit thought "Deep Throat" wasn't hard core

     9           enough to render an obscenity characterization.  And that is

    10           enough for Congress to say in order to effectively protect

    11           minors, to serve our compelling interests, we'd better use

    12           this indecency standard or a lot of bad stuff is going to get

    13           through.

    14                    But it doesn't mean that safe sex information which

    15           they have presented which is in context, very serious and

    16           important information, is indecent.  It doesn't mean that

    17           ACLU's briefs on the Pacifica case or the Cohen case are

    18           indecent because they discuss an area having to do with a

    19           dirty word.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What about the statutory history of

    21           the statute, what were the exceptions that Congress, the

    22           conference committee or Congress rejected?

    23                    MR. COPPOLINO:  The harm to minors, I think, is what

    24           the Court is referring to.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Was that Representative Berman's


                    


                                                                           109

     1           or...

     2                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, harm to minors, your Honor, is

     3           a separate standard and the plaintiff's argument seems to be

     4           that Congress, if it wanted to regulate pornography, should

     5           have used a harm to minors standard because that's been used

     6           by the states to set up display while --

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No, it's more than that because

     8           Congress specifically rejected that, that therefore it's a --

     9           there is the breadth is necessarily wider since Congress was

    10           given the opportunity to take it and elected not to,

    11           specifically elected not to.

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  In harm to minors, and harm to

    13           minors is a variable obscenity standard.  It is -- it is

    14           material that is not obscene as to adults but obscene as to

    15           minors, which means it has to satisfy the three standards of

    16           Miller as to minors.  It must be -- appeal to the prurient

    17           interest of minors, must be patently offensive depictions

    18           about sexual or excretory activities, it must have no serious

    19           literary value, as to minors it is, I concede, a narrower

    20           standard but a Congress -- but that does not mean by reverse

    21           implication that the indecency standard therefore doesn't

    22           include anything that is -- that -- anything that appeals 

    23           to --

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah, but don't you think that that

    25           precludes, to get at what Chief Judge Sloviter has been


                    


                                                                           110

     1           trying to get at for 40 minutes now --

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Have I been?

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- doesn't that -- doesn't that rule

     4           out for us, unless we be accused of being activist Federal

     5           Judges, that how could we engraft a harmful to minors test

     6           when Congress specifically rejected it?

     7                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I am not asking you to engraft a

     8           harmful to minors test and I can tell you the way that I

     9           think you can do it.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, you're not.

    11                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, mm-hmm.

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I think you can, you can, first of

    13           all, cite the authority to which Congress has applied the

    14           indecency standard and recognize that that standard has been

    15           applied to materials that are comparable to the types of

    16           materials that we believe are primarily at issue in this

    17           case.  And I refer you to, for example, the materials at

    18           issue in Dial-A-Porn which I think very few would

    19           characterize as --

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah, but you know in the Sable case

    21           Professor Tribe (ph.) was representing Sable and he argued to

    22           the Court, well, you know, this is a community standard and,

    23           you know, how in the -- the telephone, we have to go

    24           community to community and the Supreme Court said well, you

    25           know, that's your burden, okay?  And it's okay to say to a


                    


                                                                           111

     1           commercial provider whose only business is Dial-A-Porn,

     2           that's your burden.

     3                    Isn't it quite another matter to say to the

     4           University of California at Riverside or to Mr. Kuromiya

     5           sitting over there that they all have to go running to First

     6           Amendment lawyers to determine whether what they're putting

     7           on the Internet passes community standards from Brainerd,

     8           Minnesota to Cincinnati to Philadelphia to San Francisco?

     9                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I think it's a fair question, your

    10           Honor, but I think the question goes to something other than

    11           the indecency standard.  I would suggest it goes more to the

    12           issue of the least restrictive means or the over-breadth of

    13           the statute as opposed to the standard because I think that

    14           however -- wherever you apply a standard to, you have to have

    15           a standard.  You have to try to define what it is you're

    16           trying to target.  And my point to the Court is that you can

    17           recognize that the indecency standard applies to a very

    18           narrow category of speech.

    19                    The second inquiry would be does the act as a whole

    20           sweep too broadly in its reach to commercial versus non-

    21           commercial sites, Web sites versus USNet versus Chat Rooms. 

    22           But I would regard those as separate issues.  I think if you

    23           struck down the statute simply on the basis that the

    24           indecency standard was too vague and no court that has had a

    25           vagueness challenge has found it to be vague.  And they


                    


                                                                           112

     1           haven't really, really specified this point about commercial,

     2           non-commercial, they simply said we think this is -- this is

     3           clear enough for what has been applied to here by Congress.  

     4                    If it sweeps too broadly, I think those are issues

     5           more of least restrictive alternative and over-breadth which

     6           I'd be willing, I'd like to address and --

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But the Dial-A-Porn --

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You can -- no, go ahead, go ahead.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The Dial-A-Porn cases, and we all

    10           agree that Congress reached into Pacifica, reached into Sable

    11           and begot the CDA.  We all agree also, do we not, that Dial-

    12           A-Porn is all porn because that's what they call it.  That's

    13           the only content on Dial-A-Porn is porn.  Now, whether it's

    14           obscene or not is another matter.  There's only one type of

    15           content.

    16                    What our friends over here represent are 46 players,

    17           by my count, representing God knows how many individuals

    18           within their organizations and I'm sure you would agree with

    19           me, Mr. Coppolino, that not one of those plaintiffs is in the

    20           pornography business.

    21                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Not one of them is in the

    22           pornography and therefore in our view not one of them falls

    23           within the plainly legitimate sweep of this statute and I

    24           think you can find that. 

    25                    Now, whether or not the indecency standard can be


                    


                                                                           113

     1           construed to apply to all of their serious, political or

     2           scientific or educational speech, ACLU, human rights watch,

     3           safe sex and so on, I don't think you have to.  And my

     4           authority for that is to direct the Court's attention, number

     5           one, to what Congress has intended to apply the statute to

     6           and, number two, to authority applying the indecency

     7           standard.

     8                    You're absolutely correct, the indecency standard

     9           was applied to Dial-A-Porn, which is Exhibit No. 1, to show

    10           that indecency can be applied to porn, to materials that

    11           appeal to the prurient interest.  It doesn't have to be-- it

    12           doesn't have to be obscene and that I think is a very

    13           important conclusion because the Court can therefore say

    14           okay, I can -- the indecency standard can survive a vagueness

    15           challenge that the plaintiffs are making that this has to be

    16           cabined into the obscenity area for the reasons that Judge

    17           Scalia said in Sable.  If you throw it into the obscenity

    18           area, an awful lot of this patently offensive, sexually

    19           explicit material is going to fall out, it's not going to be

    20           obscene, it's not going to be completely illegal and

    21           therefore it's going to be available to minors without any

    22           restrictions.

    23                    But I think your question does go more to the over-

    24           breadth and the least restrictive means and let me deal with

    25           the over-breadth because I think it can be dealt with fairly


                    


                                                                           114

     1           discretely.

     2                    There are two facial challenges.  One is it has to

     3           be invalid in every application and I think we show that's

     4           clearly not the case.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, a substantial number?

     6                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No, there's two, there's two tests

     7           really.  One is, is it invalid in every application, answer

     8           no, I think you can -- you don't have to pause on that one.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And the other is substantial over-

    10           breadth.

    11                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Substantial over-breadth again goes

    12           to the question of whether or not the potentially

    13           unconstitutional impermissible applications are substantial

    14           in comparison to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.  And

    15           they first, I think, bootstrap back in their indecency

    16           argument, that if indecency covers so much, it's over-broad,

    17           separate argument.

    18                    The second point they make is, which is really the

    19           over-breadth point, is that the statute regulates more

    20           broadly than Web sites and more broadly than commercial Web

    21           sites and it goes to non-commercial speech and other types of

    22           speech.  Therefore, it's substantially over-broad.

    23                    But I don't think you can reach that conclusion that

    24           it's substantially over-broad that easily and I don't think 

    25           you can reach it at all.  The first point we would make to


                    


                                                                           115

     1           the Court is that we have presented evidence, a small sample

     2           but nonetheless a lot of evidence that there are -- that

     3           there is an enormous amount of material out there, a vast

     4           amount of material to which the statute can constitutionally

     5           apply.  And that is the type of material in Mr. Schmidt's

     6           notebook --

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, but if we think that that 

     8           is-- suppose we don't agree with you and we think that that

     9           is obscene.  What would follow from -- I gather that you

    10           think that some of it is not obscene, I'd like to see those

    11           portions of it, maybe those are the few that I would look at.

    12                    But leaving that -- leaving -- 

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  "Chip's Erotic Tunes," probably.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, when we looked at it, we

    15           thought and we had a motion from the plaintiffs that say

    16           that's irrelevant because that's -- that's all obscene.  And

    17           we let it in but that doesn't mean that we found that it was

    18           not essentially obscene.

    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, I don't think you have to find

    20           one way or the other that it's obscene or indecent and I

    21           don't think you should because this is a -- this is a

    22           standard, the line between what types of pornography are

    23           obscene and indecent is going to vary.  But I think it's very

    24           clear under the law that what is obscene is extremely narrow

    25           and if you were to decide that everything in the Schmidt


                    


                                                                           116

     1           notebook, everything that Surfwatch blocks is obscene, well,

     2           I don't think I'm going to win on the substantial over-

     3           breadth argument because the substantial over-breadth

     4           argument does make the point that this material can be

     5           covered and should be covered by the indecency standard

     6           because what is obscene is far too narrow and therefore,

     7           therefore the statute does have a broad, plainly legitimate

     8           sweep because these materials are properly within the scope

     9           of the indecency standard.  It is a major problem that

    10           Congress sought to address and you don't have to re-write the

    11           statute to reach this conclusion, you can see that the

    12           materials are there, you can see that the statute can reach

    13           them.  

    14                    And let me just make my point on the credit card

    15           defense.  You can see that the credit card and access code

    16           defense is readily available to those types of providers, no

    17           re-writing required.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You'll agree that all of those

    19           materials in the Schmidt notebook, I think now called the

    20           Coppolino note --

    21                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Oh, let's call it the Schmidt

    22           notebook.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- notebook were designed to appeal

    24           to the prurient interests of the viewer?

    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Do I think that?


                    


                                                                           117

     1                    THE COURT:  Yeah.

     2                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes, I would say that they would but

     3           they don't, that doesn't mean they're obscene, your Honor and

     4           that's the point.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right, well, whether or not

     6           they are, you would agree that that classification of

     7           material is designed to appeal to prurient interests?

     8                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yeah, but let me backtrack a half a

     9           step and say that there are some of those images that some

    10           might consider just artistic and that wouldn't, that wouldn't

    11           find them pruriently appealing.  Very few, I would hasten to

    12           add, but there are some mild nudes and centerfold type images

    13           which are not as explicit as others.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  all right.  But most of them were

    15           very explicit?

    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes, your Honor, but the point I'm--

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is that right?  Now, what is the

    18           other area of the substantial so-called indecency material

    19           that would come within the statute that is not of a serious,

    20           that has no serious value?

    21                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, I think the best examples I

    22           can give the Court in that regard, the non-pornographic but

    23           yet indecent materials would be of the nature of the kinds of

    24           things that, for example, the SEC has identified.  They do

    25           not go out and say --


                    


                                                                           118

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Such as?

     2                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, such as I put forward, I

     3           think, in the record three examples.  One was highly explicit

     4           excerpts from a play on AIDS.  It wasn't the whole play, it

     5           wasn't the subject matter, it was just those experts.  FCC

     6           said we're not penalizing you for discussing AIDS, we are--

     7           we are -- we do think these specific excerpts are indecent in

     8           its text and it's obviously not necessarily pornographic but

     9           let me make --

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's

    11           take that one.

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Mm-hmm.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So what you're saying is that even

    14           though the play itself, the work itself could be viewed as 

    15           a-- and I don't remember what the work was -- but as a

    16           serious literary work dealing with AIDS if excerpts of it are

    17           patently offensive in some communities, then those excerpts,

    18           at least, would fall within the statute?

    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  They might, your Honor, but I have

    20           to say I don't think that's a terribly startling conclusion

    21           because I think that the indecency standard makes clear that

    22           if you do take stuff that is in the context of the

    23           communication at issue is patently offensive, it can be

    24           indecent.  And in this instance material is taken out of

    25           context, out of its serious value and simply put out there.


                    


                                                                           119

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But wouldn't that cover almost all

     2           the plays on Broadway today?  I haven't, I don't go

     3           frequently, I --

     4                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I don't -- you -- that assumes a

     5           fact not in evidence that I know what's in those plays.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But don't almost all plays and I

     7           gather from writer friends almost all books have to have a

     8           little bit of sexual activity in order to sell?  And does the

     9           fact that a portion of what is, even though not high

    10           redeeming value but the serious work has some material that

    11           you would call -- now, I know we're on your first category

    12           but I want to explore that.

    13                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Second category now, yeah.  Well,

    14           we're on the non-pornographic category, right.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's right.  That would -- that

    16           would subject, putting those on the Internet would subject

    17           the speaker to potential criminal sanctions cause it has a

    18           portion?

    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No, I would say not, your Honor.  I

    20           would say --

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, that's what I'm trying to

    22           find out.

    23                    MR. COPPOLINO:  -- that if you -- if you -- there's

    24           been a lot of examples thrown about, "Catcher In The Rye,"

    25           which I read in high school, "Lady Chatterly's Lover," I


                    


                                                                           120

     1           would say that these works are serious literary artistic

     2           works which in context are not indecent and I have yet been

     3           cited a case which says that those are indecent under

     4           Congress' indecency standard.  They can show me some like--

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, but isn't it true that --

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But we know that in some communities

     7           they are.

     8                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No, I don't think we know that.  I

     9           think we know that --

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, sure, sure, we do.  "Lady

    11           Chatterly's Lover?"  My God, it went to the Supreme Court,

    12           that issue, didn't it?

    13                    MR. COPPOLINO:  But, your Honor, I think that --

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  On whether it was obscene.

    15                    MR. COPPOLINO:  The issue is whether or not this

    16           book in its entire context on the Internet is going to be

    17           legally indecent under this standard as Congress has applied

    18           it.  Whether the alternative is an obscenity standard where

    19           very little is going to be covered, I think the answer is

    20           that's not what Congress intended and that it would not and

    21           should not be found to be indecent.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Let me, if I may?

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Go ahead, yes, sure, I didn't mean

    24           to interrupt.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I asked our friends on the other


                    


                                                                           121

     1           side a number of questions about the medium and the

     2           significance of the medium.  Now -- and I think it's

     3           undisputed or indisputable that Congress reached out to the

     4           Pacifica case and you put tremendous weight on the Pacifica

     5           case and the Sable case and begot the CDA.

     6                    As I read your material and your position in this

     7           case, you say that Pacifica should not be limited just to

     8           broadcast because what really bothered the Supreme Court and

     9           permitted that to be upheld was the surprise element.  And

    10           that's why you took us through "Jasmine" and "Little Women."

    11                    Do I understand your position correctly, that that's

    12           why Pacifica, because you would agree this is not

    13           broadcasting we're dealing with here?

    14                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I do agree it's not broadcasting and

    15           I have left the Pacifica argument in just to make a point

    16           that as the Court applies the Sable standard, it considers

    17           the elements of pervasiveness and surprise that are -- that

    18           exist on the Internet.

    19                    I am not here arguing, after I read the Fabulous

    20           decision, that you've got to apply the Pacifica standard of

    21           review, Sable doesn't even apply.  I don't think that's a

    22           fair characterization of our position.

    23                    But -- and so Sable requires the Government has a

    24           compelling interest that the statute regulate least

    25           restrictively.  But I'm not going to abandon the lessons of


                    


                                                                           122

     1           Pacifica entirely as you apply Sable.

     2                    This is a highly pervasive medium.  You asked Mr.

     3           Hansen how does it compare, what would you compare it more

     4           to, print or broadcast.  It's a hard question but I think

     5           clearly you've got to compare it more to broadcast.  In my

     6           first exhibit --

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Why?

     8                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, I would say Mr. Bradner, Mr.

     9           Bradner and others have made the point that this is a medium

    10           that for which other types of media area converging.  It's

    11           not just point and click and get a text, you get text, you

    12           get images, you can get video, you can get -- you can get a

    13           lot of other materials that are piped through to the home in

    14           a manner in which the differentiation between the media is

    15           diminishing.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, but isn't the key in

    17           broadcasting the fact that there are only limited number of--

    18                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, that's definitely a key, your

    19           Honor.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Frequencies.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- frequencies.

    22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I think that's right, that's

    23           definitely our key but I think there what --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is that not -- isn't -- and

    25           therefore the Government has to regulate.


                    


                                                                           123

     1                    MR. COPPOLINO:  It's ap-- I think it's almost--

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Don't --

     3                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Okay.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And here you don't have that kind

     5           of limitation and therefore governmental interest or

     6           involvement.  I just want to hear your response.

     7                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, the response to that is that

     8           yes, the limited number of entities on the broadcast spectrum

     9           is a key factor in Pacifica which I think led the Court to

    10           find that communication was indecent.

    11                    The point I'm trying to make is that there are other

    12           elements that can be derived from Pacifica such as

    13           pervasiveness and elements of surprise which can be applied

    14           here.  It's not a perfect analogy, but I don't think you can

    15           discount it entirely in this media.

    16                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  But even though there is no

    17           perfect analogy here, and, you know, I think you can get a

    18           list and you can put on one side and, you know, it's going to

    19           kind of balance out, I think.  But why does that matter? 

    20           Both parties seem to think the specific nature here matters. 

    21           Why does it matter?

    22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I think it matters most directly in

    23           connection with the Government's compelling interest because

    24           if we can -- as we have demonstrated to the Court, this is a

    25           pervasive media, there's 12 million on line through


                    


                                                                           124

     1           commercial on-line services, millions more through ISP's,

     2           computers -- computers come right in --

     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  But I mean in the law and this,

     4           this is I'm asking you for your explanation of the law, why

     5           does it matter if we look at this more like broadcasting than

     6           if we look at it more like a newspaper?

     7                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, I think it matters more if you

     8           look at it more like broadcasting because I think that

     9           certainly there's less tolerance of indecency in

    10           broadcasting.

    11                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay, as I just -- that's what I

    12           thought your answer would be and I wanted to understand your

    13           position.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But that's what I don't get.

    15                    MR. COPPOLINO:  So I'm trying to get you closer to

    16           that and then the newspapers.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  In terms of pervasiveness and

    18           surprise, okay?  Let me give an example because it relates to

    19           this medium question that I've been pressing, okay?

    20                    I brought with me yesterday's Inquirer, okay?  Now,

    21           I'll tell you a little anecdote.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The Philadelphia Inquirer, you

    23           might as well advertise it.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The Philadelphia Inquirer, right.

    25                    (Laughter.)


                    


                                                                           125

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And I'll tell you a little anecdote,

     2           little anecdote, okay, in the Dalzell household.  My ten year

     3           old son within the class that Congress wants to protect, we

     4           know that.  My ten year old son is a rabid Phillies fan and

     5           the first thing he does in the morning when he comes down for

     6           his breakfast is he gets the Inquirer and he looks to see how

     7           the Phillies did.

     8                    So yesterday he looked and he saw that the Phils

     9           edged Astros' intent, but he also saw above the fold a

    10           Liberian prisoner faces death and that is to say one of the

    11           more grisly pictures I have ever seen above the fold of an

    12           unarmed man being shot to death while men in the background

    13           are laughing.

    14                    Now, let's assume that parents who shared the horror

    15           of my son at seeing this went to Congress and said this has

    16           got to stop, so let's pass a newspaper decency act that

    17           provides that any depiction of murder be shown below the

    18           fold.  It's a trivial intrusion, it costs nothing.   Do you

    19           have any doubt that that would be unconstitutional?

    20                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I have very few doubts that that

    21           would be unconstitutional.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So why would that minimal, that

    23           minimal intrusion on the editors of the Philadelphia Inquirer

    24           to prevent what I think most fair-minded people would say is

    25           the most indecent picture that they could imagine of one


                    


                                                                           126

     1           human being wantonly killing another defenseless human being,

     2           that that can't be moved to the bottom of the fold but that

     3           Congress has the power to control the access of a much more

     4           pervasive medium, the Internet?

     5                    MR. COPPOLINO:  A couple of points, your Honor. 

     6           First of all, indecent, yes, but not necessarily, but not

     7           indecent as this indecency standard means.  Indecency under

     8           the Communications Decency Act or in a number of these other

     9           acts in Dial-A-Porn does not mean serious material, not

    10           suitable for adults -- or for children like someone getting

    11           killed on the front page of the Philadelphia Inquirer.  It

    12           means, first of all, sexual or excretory activities.

    13                    For example, Mr. Ennis, I believe, cited an abortion

    14           case, a District Court decision where someone wanted to put

    15           on an ad about abortion and there was going to be a very

    16           graphic depiction of abortion.  And the District Court said

    17           hey, I think this is indecent and you have to channel it to

    18           past ten o'clock, FCC disagreed with that. 

    19                    FCC said you should channel it under a separate

    20           regulation but it's not indecent.  So that's my first point

    21           in response.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah, but I don't think you're

    23           answering my question.  My question is since we agree with

    24           each other under Tornillo and other cases that Congress would

    25           not have the power to adopt a newspaper decency act which


                    


                                                                           127

     1           would merely require the Inquirer to put this same photo on

     2           the same page but below the fold so it has no cost, it's

     3           trivial, but that would still be unconstitutional.  What is

     4           it about the Internet medium that makes it a completely

     5           different ball game?

     6                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, I think -- I think one of the

     7           differences, we all know the print medium has the very

     8           broadest of First Amendment protections and I think the

     9           differences with the Internet media is that it allows for

    10           tremendously broad array of materials far beyond what would

    11           go into a newspaper to come right into the home and be easily

    12           available, not mere text, not even mere images but moving

    13           images as well and as technology advances you're going to see

    14           the speed with which the stuff can come down to your computer

    15           increase.  It is becoming television-like, I guess is the

    16           point.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But this happened instantly to my

    18           son on his way to finding out that the Phillies beat the

    19           Astros, instantly, total surprise, worse than finding

    20           "Jasmine" he sees this human being wantonly murdering an

    21           unarmed person who is pleading for his life.

    22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I think the answer is the best I can

    23           think of at this point is that I think the answer is that the

    24           interactive computer services and home computers are becoming

    25           more entertainment and television-like in what they can put


                    


                                                                           128

     1           forward to children.

     2                    And I guess to change the analogy a little bit, if I

     3           may, your Honor, what I am putting at issue in this case and

     4           what I believe is at issue in the indecency standard are the

     5           types of materials that we have submitted and your son could

     6           not pick that up on his doorstep.

     7                    He couldn't go into a drugstore and buy Penthouse or

     8           PLayboy, I think you said he was ten years old, they can't

     9           tell that to minors.  He couldn't go into an adult book

    10           store, he couldn't go into an adult movie theater and he

    11           can't get that stuff.

    12                    So he can pick up a paper and see a very graphic

    13           picture of that, but he can't get our stuff -- this stuff as

    14           easily.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If he subscribed, I don't know if

    16           these are subscription magazines or anything, but if he

    17           subscribed, if his parents subscribed to them they'd come

    18           through the mail and Congress couldn't, could it, say that

    19           you can't let the child look in the centerfold?

    20                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No, Congress can't regulate every

    21           problem but it can regulate problems in some ways.  And what

    22           it has done is try to regulate this problem in a I think

    23           fairly described a least restrictive manner, certainly as

    24           with respect to the content providers because these, the

    25           content providers certainly for commercial sites because


                    


                                                                           129

     1           these folks can avail themselves of these very specific

     2           defenses.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Isn't a key to your argument that a

     4           child, person under 18, could inadvertently come across some

     5           of this material?  I notice that you put a lot of focus on

     6           that evidence during the evidentiary portrayal.  Is that --

     7           and in your brief.  Is that inadvertence a key to your

     8           argument?

     9                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, I'm not sure I would describe

    10           it as -- well, I certainly wouldn't describe it as the key or

    11           a key.  I think it's an important part of the argument to

    12           show to the Court, number one, that the Government has a

    13           compelling interest here and, number two, that this material

    14           is pervasive and you should take that into account.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The Government's -- yeah, but let's

    16           go back.  What is the connection between the Government's

    17           interest and the what we'll call for this point inadvertence?

    18                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, here is the connection.  You

    19           can get this kind of material on the Internet by looking for

    20           it and I believe  the evidence shows you can get this kind of

    21           material when you're not looking for it.

    22                    Certainly you can get -- you can get right up to it. 

    23           And I think that the reason we put those searches in Mr.

    24           Schmidt's testimony, we put both kinds.  You're a 14 or 15

    25           year old, you're familiar with the ways of the world, you


                    


                                                                           130

     1           want to go out and find stuff you can't get in the drugstore

     2           or the book store, you can find it.  You can look for and

     3           find it.

     4                    But you are someone who is searching for a Disney

     5           character or for something on media images of women, the

     6           journalism student at -- in a high school who is searching

     7           for that and you can be confronted then with sexually

     8           explicit, links to sexually explicit sites.  And I would

     9           suggest to the Court this demonstrates that the Government

    10           does have a compelling interest here and underscores what

    11           that interest is.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If we-- if we find -- and I'm not

    13           saying we will, we haven't even talked to each other for

    14           weeks -- well, they may have, but I haven't.  If we -- they

    15           are on the same floor.

    16                    If we find that the evidence does not support the

    17           proposition that there is a significant problem of

    18           inadvertently chancing upon such material because you have to

    19           do a lot of clicks or because there's a warning, what would

    20           remain of the Government's contention of a compelling

    21           Government interest?

    22                    In other words, is there a compelling Government

    23           interest as a matter of law to shield 15 year olds from -- 14

    24           year olds from material they want to see and their parents

    25           don't care whether they see or not?


                    


                                                                           131

     1                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, I think that virtually

     2           all of our interest remains.  And I'll tell you -- I'll tell

     3           you why.  I think that to just evaluate  the case on this

     4           issue of inadvertence, of surprise, it's a factor, it's

     5           something to take into account.  Certainly these hits are

     6           jarring when you're looking for something that's not sexually

     7           explicit, but the key point is the ease with which minors --

     8           anybody, but minors in particular can get access to this

     9           stuff and that is the important thing.  Not whether --

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If they want it.

    11                    MR. COPPOLINO:  If they want it.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And whether or not the parents

    13           care?  Because I thought in reading the conference committee

    14           that it all dealt with, you know, they want to help the

    15           parents.

    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, yes, they do want to help the

    17           parents.  Here's the point, your Honor.  A child or a minor,

    18           let's take a junior high student or someone over 13, as I

    19           said, he can't go buy it in the store, he can't go into the

    20           movie theater, he can't go into the adult book store, but he

    21           can't --

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  He can go into the library in

    23           Pittsburgh.

    24                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, he can't get this stuff in the

    25           library.


                    


                                                                           132

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh.

     2                    MR. COPPOLINO:  And he can click it on and get it,

     3           and that's really, I think, the heart  of the interest.  If

     4           he knows what he's doing or if it's an accident, but the key

     5           to the interest is that you can get it, you can get a lot of

     6           it, you can get it easily and you can get it across a range

     7           that has never been available before to minors.  And that's

     8           the significant interest at stake. 

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Books, what, I keep coming back to

    10           that question: what is it about this medium which our

    11           friends, I think you would have to agree with them, have

    12           established is this most democratic of mediums that the human

    13           mind has come up with yet, what is it about this medium that

    14           makes it different from print in terms of the constitutional

    15           protection it should receive?

    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Uhm, well, I'm not sure I really

    17           understand the question but I'm going to try to -- I'm going

    18           to try to answer it this way.  This is a telecommunications

    19           medium which pipes down to the home this kind of material

    20           along with other kinds of materials that would be useful to a

    21           child, educational materials, scientific materials and so on.

    22                    If you talk about the print medium, the print medium

    23           in your newspaper there, you're not going to get access to

    24           this kind of patently offensive, sexually explicit material

    25           at all.  You're not going to get access to that kind of stuff


                    


                                                                           133

     1           unless you go buy it, but this you can.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Above the fold in the New York Times

     3           just within the last two weeks above the fold was a story on

     4           female genital mutilation in Africa, it had a photograph of a

     5           woman who was scared to death to go back there, and I'll tell

     6           you, I think -- it's a terrible problem but I would be a bit

     7           concerned about my son reading it above the fold.

     8                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Sure.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Should we have that newspaper

    10           decency act?

    11                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I'm not going to advocate the

    12           newspaper decency act, your Honor.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So your argument really is that this

    14           is like broadcasting?

    15                    MR. COPPOLINO:  My argument is that this is much

    16           closer to broadcasting than it is to print.  And in a few

    17           years, as Mr. Bradner said, it will be virtually the same as

    18           broadcasting.  You're not going to have a handful of

    19           entities, but you're going to have -- you're going to have

    20           this very pervasive -- if I could just make one last point,

    21           your Honor.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, it won't be last because we

    23           have questions.

    24                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Mr. -- Mr. Burrington and I believe

    25           Mr. Bradner, but certainly it is a fact in the record that


                    


                                                                           134

     1           the Internet can be piped through not just through a 14.4 or

     2           a 28.8 modem, but through coaxial cables, that's a coming

     3           technology, it's being tested out in the market right now.

     4                    That's going to zoom the stuff down to the

     5           marketplace faster than we can do now with these, with even

     6           this T-1 line that we had in here.  And, and as I have

     7           indicated, you have more than just pictures and text.  You're

     8           going to have images, you're going to have movies.  It's

     9           going to be like cable television more than anything else.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  If we hold, for example, that a

    11           chatroom bears no resemblance to anything on the broadcast

    12           medium, do you lose?

    13                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No, I don't -- I don't think we lose

    14           but I do think that the chatrooms and some of the other

    15           medias present different questions and admittedly tougher

    16           questions.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But you would agree with me that the

    18           chatroom bears no resemblance whatever to a broadcast medium?



    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, one thing --

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's interactive, people are talking

    21           to one another --

    22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Mm-hmm.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- not the telephone.

    24                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, aren't the broadcast media


                    


                                                                           135

     1           shows interactive, too, some of them, as I recall?  The talk,

     2           the call-in shows and so forth?

     3                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I think that's right, but even --

     4           even with --

     5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Are they --

     6                    MR. COPPOLINO:  The one thing you have to bear in

     7           mind on the interactive computer service is  that it's

     8           generally run over telephone lines and a chatroom certainly

     9           is not -- is not all that different from communicating over a

    10           telephone line although you can see it in print on your

    11           screen.  And Dial-A-Porn comes over the Internet.  You can

    12           have audio applications.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But Dial-A-Porn doesn't go beyond

    14           porn, by definition.  The Supreme Court made it absolutely

    15           clear that's all they were dealing with was porn, they

    16           weren't dealing with the generic question of whether Congress

    17           has the power to control a conversation that I have with

    18           Chief Judge Sloviter or, I guess more accurately for this

    19           case, that she has with my ten year old son.

    20                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, that's right.  But were

    21           kind of back now to does this indecency standard cover every

    22           time someone uses a dirty word in a chatroom when they get

    23           mad.  And I would suggest that that's really not what it's

    24           intended to cover and the chatrooms do present tougher issues

    25           than the commercial Web sites where it is clearly


                    


                                                                           136

     1           constitutional.  But as Mr. Baron will indicate this

     2           afternoon, there are methods that if you -- there are methods

     3           where if you're going to have a highly sexually explicit

     4           chatroom discussion, that there are methods that people can

     5           take to screen access even to that, screen access by minors

     6           even to that kind of stuff, that this is not -- there are 

     7           not -- there are not, as Mr. Ennis says, no possible defenses

     8           even for those media.

     9                    But if I could maybe --

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I'd like to get back  to the

    11           Government's first, basic First Amendment position because

    12           I'm -- and I know we've thrown this at you, but we've been

    13           bottling this up as we read it.

    14                    If -- does the Government have the right to make it

    15           a criminal offense for a 14 year old to read Henry -- let's

    16           assume that Henry Miller's "Tropic of Cancer" would be

    17           indecent under the statute.  I mean, as I recall from when I

    18           read it and I was probably not 18 at the time, there -- I

    19           mean I think I might find it much more indecent now than I

    20           did then, but my --

    21                    (Laughter.)

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- sensibilities have changed.

    23                    But I'm thinking of like the most indecent,

    24           potentially indecent book I ever read.  And let's assume, I

    25           think, can we assume that "Tropic of Cancer" would be


                    


                                                                           137

     1           indecent in some communities?

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, yes, I think so, in some

     3           communities. 

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Certainly patently offensive, the

     5           language, the subject matter and everything else.  Do you

     6           claim that the First Amendment's extension of rights to read

     7           that kind of material don't cover a 14 year old?  I just want

     8           to -- yeah, do --

     9                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Don't cover a 14 year old?  Well, I

    10           do think that, first of all, if you assume the conclusion

    11           that it is indecent --

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, let's --

    13                    MR. COPPOLINO:  -- which I'm not quite sure I agree

    14           with.  But if you take that assumption, I do think that

    15           Congress can draw a bright line, that it's very difficult to

    16           differentiate between the maturity levels and the abilities

    17           of minors at different ages to deal with this stuff.

    18                    Now, certainly a 14 year old might be able to deal

    19           with it better than an eight year old that probably couldn't

    20           even read it.  So there are differences between minors, I

    21           don't dispute Mr. Hansen's point on that.  I think the

    22           problem though is once you try to move that line down and try

    23           to capture the more mature minors, you're going to have a

    24           terribly difficult problem regulating that.  And therefore I

    25           think Congress is entitled to say age of, you know, age of


                    


                                                                           138

     1           adulthood, age 18, is the line that we're going to draw here.

     2                    Now, you're assuming that this book is indecent and

     3           I'm not sure.  I mean I read "Catcher In The Rye" in high

     4           school and I wasn't 18 yet.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think this is -- this is a

     6           different medium.  I think that this is a different, as I

     7           recall I think this is far different from "Catcher In The

     8           Rye."

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, very different.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And I think they even tried  to

    11           keep it out of this country at some point.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  They did, they did.

    13                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I'm going to go buy it, in fact.

    14                    (Laughter.)

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's really not that good.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I don't think it is now but one

    17           might have argued that it had some benefit at that time

    18           because it opened the freedom to read literature like this. 

    19           I don't know.

    20                    But I'm just interested in the basic proposition

    21           because we're dealing with the Government's interests.  I

    22           mean I am coming back to this case because the question is,

    23           is there a compelling Government interest?

    24                    And if you don't deal with the inadvertence, if you

    25           say well, inadvertence is not really a problem, there's more


                    


                                                                           139

     1           of a Government interest here and you say yes, there is and

     2           it's not just the inadvertence, then the question is how much

     3           Government interest has been sustained by the case law in

     4           keeping children from material that is not purveyed for

     5           prurient interests by commercial enterprises, and that's a

     6           very basic question that we have.  And --

     7                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yeah, I -- I'm not aware of the

     8           cases which have said that the Government has a compelling

     9           interest in shielding minors from access to literature of

    10           this -- I'm not quite sure what this is so I'm not going to,

    11           I'm not going to talk about that.  But let's just assume

    12           serious literature that might contain sexually explicit

    13           scenes in it, the Government's compelling interest has been--

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Themes.

    15                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  What is the Government's

    16           compelling interest in this case?

    17                    MR. COPPOLINO:  The Government's compelling interest

    18           has been in this case and in many cases like it has been

    19           consistently upheld as to protecting minors from exposure to

    20           non-obscene materials, that is materials that are not obscene

    21           as to adult but nonetheless harmful to minors.  And when you

    22           look at every one of those cases, whether it's the indecency

    23           cases or the harm to minors cases, you are talking about the

    24           kinds of sexually explicit materials we've put forward.  And

    25           we are suggesting to the Court that that is the compelling


                    


                                                                           140

     1           interest that is here.  The plaintiffs --

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But we didn't, but they didn't put

     3           a harmful to minors provision in.  We have to read it in?

     4                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No, your Honor, the cases involving

     5           non-obscene mater-- materials that are not obscene as to

     6           adults but harmful to minors are both the harmful to minors

     7           test and the indecency test.  In Sable and in these cases

     8           implying the indecency standard, they point that right out.

     9                    They say the Court in -- Supreme Court in Ginsburg

    10           and Ferber says that the Government has a compelling interest

    11           in protecting children from material that is not obscene as

    12           to adults but harmful to minors and in this case they're

    13           using the indecency standard, I don't think that that really

    14           matters much.

    15                    I could probably conclude with two --

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Go ahead.

    17                    MR. COPPOLINO:   I could -- I could conclude now, I

    18           could start again this afternoon.  The only --

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, go ahead, you finish up

    20           yourself.

    21                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Okay.  That would be probably a good

    22           idea.  I mean the -- just the one point I want to make, the

    23           one --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And you've done beautifully.

    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  The one -- two final points.  On


                    


                                                                           141

     1           this issue of over-breadth and I think least restrictive

     2           means, I would ask the Court to very seriously consider that

     3           there is a substantial valid application of the statute as to

     4           the types of materials that we have submitted and you don't

     5           have to re-write the statute to find that.  I think we

     6           presented you the evidence that there is a serious problem

     7           and I think the defenses, certainly the credit card and

     8           access code defenses easily apply, it can apply and the

     9           providers can do it.

    10                    Let me just touch briefly on the -- 

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Could I ask you another question?

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Okay.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, I didn't think you'd say no.

    14                    (Laughter.)

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Baron is going to deal with the

    16           defenses but as I understand, you're saying that if it's

    17           material with a serious redeeming value it wouldn't be

    18           covered and --

    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No, I'm saying that material that as

    20           a whole has a serious redeeming value --

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  -- it shouldn't be covered by this

    23           standard such as the materials the plaintiffs have submitted.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, in the conference committee

    25           report the conference committee report says they would --


                    


                                                                           142

     1           they are not really a problem because there is no intent to

     2           offend.

     3                    Do you think we have to read into the statute an

     4           intent to offend?

     5                    MR. COPPOLINO:  well, I think that that language is,

     6           I think that intent to offend is such a significant standard

     7           that that would be a lot to read that intention standard into

     8           the statute, but I think it underscores Congress' intention

     9           that the material be limited to -- to the types of materials

    10           that they specifically identified in the Congressional

    11           Record, to the types of materials that I am talking about.

    12                    But I don't --

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is your answer a yes or a no?

    14                    MR. COPPOLINO:   I guess my answer is I don't think

    15           you can read into the statute an intent to offend cause it's

    16           not in the statute.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Even though that was the reason --

    18           well, neither are a lot of the other things.  But that was

    19           the reason the conference committee report gave for exempting

    20           in a way although not explicitly material of a serious

    21           redeeming value.

    22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes, but my arguments with respect

    23           to your construction of indecency and over-breadth I think

    24           are fully comfortable within the statutory language, to read

    25           in an intense standard is more.  And I would just suggest to


                    


                                                                           143

     1           the Court that that language in the conference report

     2           underscores the parameters and the limitations of the

     3           indecency standard, but I think beyond that I really couldn't

     4           ask -- tell the Court to construe it that way because it's

     5           just -- it's just not plain from the statute.

     6                    The -- I guess the last point, I'll make this fairly

     7           quickly.  As you know, I cross-examined Mrs. Duvall and I

     8           think that the parental controls -- I just want to make a

     9           point on the parental controls as a less restrictive means.

    10                    They are certainly very commendable products but I

    11           think we saw a number of the flaws with those products which

    12           suggest that they cannot by themselves serve this purpose.

    13           And I think, just to sum it up in a nutshell, Mrs. Duvall I

    14           think very candidly indicated that Surfwatch is constantly

    15           trying to update.  They started with 2,000 sites, they're now

    16           up to about 8,000.  There's four to eight hundred new sites a

    17           week, there's a constant lag and there is a constant effort

    18           to change, to chase up and catch up with these sites. 

    19                    And, as the Court also saw in Mr. Schmidt's

    20           testimony, sites change their names almost within a couple of

    21           days.  And therefore Surfwatch by itself and products like

    22           that which try to identify sites or have key words can't do

    23           the job.  Key words don't necessarily get you there either

    24           because you saw there's lot of exhibits that we submitted

    25           that don't have a sexually explicit URL and they're not going


                    


                                                                           144

     1           to get picked up on a key word search.  So you've either got

     2           to know what that site is, if you haven't found it already,

     3           Surfwatch is not going to pick it up.

     4                    So I think -- I think our brief has made that point

     5           pretty clearly and I guess I will -- I will stop there.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What scrutiny do we apply?

     7                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, I -- you apply the Sable

     8           test, but you -- which is --

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is that strict scrutiny?

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's strict scrutiny, sure.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, that's all right.

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Taking into account my argument on

    13           Pacifica.

    14                    (Laughter.)

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you very much.  We will meet

    16           again in an hour and we will begin with Mr. Baron.

    17                    Thank you, Mr. Coppolino.

    18                    (Court in recess; 12:46 o'clock p.m.)

    19                                 AFTERNOON SESSION

    20                                (1:48 o'clock p.m.)

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Hello, Mr. Baron.

    22                    MR. BARON:  Good afternoon, your Honors.  Jason R.

    23           Baron for the Justice Department.  

    24                    I'd like to pick up where Mr. Coppolino left off, in

    25           outlining what are the available affirmative defenses to non-


                    


                                                                           145

     1           commercial content providers on the Internet.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Before you do that, could you

     3           address briefly, if necessary, my question which is whether

     4           the availability of defenses -- the viability of the theory

     5           that if you have defenses in the statute, assuming that they

     6           were good defenses, that saves it from any over-breadth or

     7           vagueness?

     8                    MR. BARON:  I think you would need to restate the

     9           question, your Honor.  Is it in the context of other statutes

    10           you're asking, or --

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, has any Supreme Court case held

    12           that a criminal statute that has defenses in it is thereby

    13           saved from overbreadth.

    14                    MR. BARON:  I'm not aware of case law that parallels

    15           the statute, your Honor.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Or is there any other statute like

    17           this that talks in terms of defenses to a criminal statute?

    18                    MR. BARON:  Other than the Dial-a-Porn context, I'm

    19           not aware of one that dovetails with the words of this

    20           statute.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I don't mean the words, I mean this

    22           context that the existence of a defense is enough to save the

    23           statute, that you have to consider it with the existence of a

    24           defense.

    25                    MR. BARON:  Yes, but it is the position of the


                    


                                                                           146

     1           Government, however, that the broad nature of the affirmative

     2           defenses that are part of this statute do allow for

     3           sufficient defenses to be asserted so that there would not be

     4           a substantial number of applications that would be subject to

     5           the kind of overbreadth challenge that Mr. Coppolino was

     6           discussing.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But you can't give us any

     8           citations?

     9                    MR. BARON:  Not today, your Honor.  The touchstone

    10           of --

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We don't want more briefs. 

    12           (Laughter.)  But go ahead, Mr. Baron, we'll hear you.

    13                    MR. BARON:  The touchstone of what Congress intended

    14           by way of the affirmative defenses that are set forth in the

    15           CDA is of course the statute itself supplemented by its

    16           legislative history.  Congress not only provided for the

    17           concrete defenses that are listed in E5(b) regarding credit

    18           card, debit account, adult access code, adult personal

    19           identification numbers, but they went further.  The text of

    20           223 E5(a) provides for a broad range of affirmative defenses

    21           to be asserted by content providers based on their taking

    22           reasonable, effective and appropriate actions under the

    23           circumstances and in light of what is feasible based on

    24           available technology.  The statute represents a forward-

    25           looking approach to what everyone concedes is an


                    


                                                                           147

     1           extraordinarily creative, flexible and powerful new means of

     2           communication.

     3                    The very words of the statute imply that what is

     4           feasible under the circumstances based on available

     5           technology today may change.  Congress expected that it would

     6           change.  Thus, the statute does not consist of a static

     7           snapshot of available defenses, but keys those defenses to

     8           what is feasible to do under available technology.

     9                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  And if none are available, then

    10           that is a defense, too?

    11                    MR. BARON:  Excuse me, your Honor?

    12                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  If none are available, is that a

    13           defense?

    14                    MR. BARON:  The statute contemplates that there --

    15           well, I believe the evidence of record shows that there are

    16           certainly available defenses --

    17                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, we might discuss that

    18           later, but -- 

    19                    MR. BARON:  But the -- 

    20                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Maybe Judge Dalzell wants to

    21           discuss it now.  (Laughter.)

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, I mean tagging isn't available

    23           now, is it?

    24                    MR. BARON:  It has been the evidence of record that

    25           as was evident from the first day of the hearings before the


                    


                                                                           148

     1           Court that there are schemes that the available standards and

     2           protocols of the Internet allow for putting in place, and

     3           that the marketplace is poised to allow for tagging and

     4           labeling schemes that are content selection schemes such as

     5           Congress envisioned.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But getting at what Mr. Hansen said,

     7           which is to say this statute is effective immediately.  But

     8           for the TRO and then the stipulation and order of February

     9           26th, this statute would be effective.  Are we agreed?  And

    10           therefore those defenses would be effective immediately.

    11                    MR. BARON:  Well, the power of the scheme that we

    12           have brought forth is if this -- by plaintiff's own

    13           concession this morning and by the testimony that you've

    14           heard from plaintiff's own witness, Mr. Vezza, as well as

    15           others, that if this hearing were being held in July or even

    16           earlier, it would be expected that Microsoft and Netscape and

    17           virtually all of the marketplace of browsers would be able to

    18           assimilate a PICs compatible labels and by the force of our

    19           argument other labeling schemes that are more generic.

    20                    So but for the fact that this was an expedited

    21           schedule and the Court has wanted to go forward in settling

    22           this matter on a facial challenge as fast as possible, we're

    23           in May, we may be in a different place in July.  That is the

    24           thrust of the Government's position on tagging, that it's

    25           poised, the marketplace is poised and the admissions there.


                    


                                                                           149

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But it's not a defense now because

     2           it can't be.  Nobody has -L18 because it was just Dr. Olsen's

     3           idea that was born on or about April 1, 1996.

     4                    MR. BARON:  It was certainly something that was

     5           brought forward by our expert after the passage of the Act as

     6           one way that a content selection standard as envisioned by

     7           Congress in the conference report could go into widespread

     8           effect.

     9                    Now, I --

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Now, since it's not available, since

    11           we agree it's not available yet, right?

    12                    MR. BARON:  Certainly the -L18 standard as proposed

    13           by Dr. Olsen is not available today.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And neither is the PICs available.

    15                    MR. BARON:  It's certainly not widely available by

    16           the evidence presented in this court.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But what is available is, for

    18           example, what Compuserve tried to do, isn't it?  What more

    19           could Compuserve have done than it did before the FBI visited

    20           them?

    21                    MR. BARON:  I don't think that's a good example,

    22           your Honor.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, but would you answer my

    24           example?  What more could Compuserve have than what it did,

    25           assuming the CDA applied?


                    


                                                                           150

     1                    MR. BARON:  Let me say, Judge Dalzell, that I am not

     2           aware of all the facts and circumstances that have given rise

     3           to the set of correspondence that was just filed with the

     4           Court.  And I will say that --

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I know no more than you do because I

     6           read their motion.

     7                    MR. BARON:  Correct, your Honor, and the evidence

     8           that submitted as part of the correspondence back and forth

     9           showed that the Justice Department was concerned that there

    10           may be obscenity with respect to the particular transmissions

    11           and forum at issue.  And so the transaction was captioned as

    12           the Communications Decency Act matter but the Communications

    13           Decency Act is obviously broader than 223(d).  Congress

    14           amended various provisions of the statute, including current

    15           existing obscenity law for on line communication.

    16                    So with that caveat, the question would be whether

    17           the posting of material in a Compuserve directory which is an

    18           adult directory and where parental controls are known to be

    19           in place, if that's the hypothetical that I can sort of boil

    20           -- boil down the Compuserve example --

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, it's not hypothetical --

    22           right, and it's labeled, it's labeled adults only.

    23                    MR. BARON:  Correct.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And not in a titillating way as I

    25           recall.  It was just text.  It was just text.


                    


                                                                           151

     1                    MR. BARON:  I will take that as a given, your Honor. 

     2           The fact is that as we stated at page 62 of our post-hearing

     3           brief about other available means by which content providers

     4           could avail themselves of the affirmative defenses, and by

     5           means of Mr. Keeney's (ph) letter in the Shea case, the

     6           answer to your hypothetical would be, I would expect that

     7           there would be an affirmative defense in this situation.  But

     8           that matter would have to be evaluated under the facts and

     9           circumstances of the case.  But clearly there's an

    10           affirmative defense if there's that kind of posting under the

    11           available technology today.  But we have to go back to the

    12           words of the statute.

    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  So that right now, Mr. Baron --

    14           I'm sorry to interrupt you, but this either indicates the

    15           weakness of the Government's case or my lack of

    16           understanding, which is considerable in some of these areas. 

    17           As I understand it now under 5(a) there is no way to take an

    18           effective means -- for a speaker --  speaker to take

    19           effective means to make sure that someone under 18 doesn't

    20           get his material that is indecent or patently offensive.

    21                    MR. BARON:  No, that's not correct.

    22                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  What is the way?  I thought there

    23           was no effective way.

    24                    MR. BARON:  We set out a number of ways in our

    25           brief, in our post-hearing brief as well as in earlier briefs


                    


                                                                           152

     1           in discussion before the Court.

     2                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Please tell me one of them.  I

     3           must -- maybe I don't understand.

     4                    MR. BARON:  I will concentrate on tagging, because

     5           it is the most simple and elegant solution.  But you're

     6           asking what other means are available.  And what we said was

     7           that --

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Effectively --

     9                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  That's not available now.  That's

    10           not available now and it's --

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It's hypothetical.

    12                    MR. BARON:  I think under a broad interpretation of

    13           what is available, the technology exists for putting that

    14           into place.  It's just a question of, as Dr. Olsen said, four

    15           hours of tweaking a Netscape proxy server to have 80 percent

    16           of the market put into place.  But conceding for the moment

    17           the thrust of the question --

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Effectively available and has been

    19           shown to work, let's put -- is that a fair modification?

    20                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yes, that's right, yes.

    21                    MR. BARON:  Okay.  But understanding your question,

    22           we did put forth as a secondary means the means of

    23           registering sites to make known to the world what your

    24           material consists of.

    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I understand that, but that


                    


                                                                           153

     1           doesn't do -- that's not effective at all, is it under the

     2           present --

     3                    MR. BARON:  Well, I disagree, your Honor.

     4                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, how is it effective?  I

     5           mean that person who registers his site, that doesn't

     6           guarantee that someone under 18 won't get into it.

     7                    MR. BARON:  Well, if the test, as plaintiffs would

     8           posit it throughout their voluminous filings in this case

     9           with declarations and their other papers -- their whole case

    10           is that your Honors should rule against the statute because

    11           it doesn't guarantee, in your words, or doesn't assure that

    12           every minor in the United States --

    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, you don't have to do that,

    14           but effective certainly means that it has to have something

    15           more than no effect, or little, no or little effect.

    16                    MR. BARON:  And the evidence shows that if

    17           individual content providers make known to the world their

    18           sites that would be otherwise within the scope of the CDA,

    19           then that is enormously effective as compared with not making

    20           their sites known.

    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Oh, well, as compared with not,

    22           yes.

    23                    MR. BARON:  And therefore the surfwatches, the

    24           cyberpatrols, the major online services that either have in

    25           place parental controls today or are imminently about to have


                    


                                                                           154

     1           parental controls for not only their own proprietary systems

     2           but also the Internet, can take advantage of knowing that

     3           you're out there.  We have heard extensive --

     4                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  You have explained that and

     5           that's the position that I understood from the evidence.

     6                    MR. BARON:  And Congress did not say that one needed

     7           to take an action so as to be 100 percent effective, 100

     8           perfect.  Obviously the case law suggests that enterprising

     9           youth in a variety of contexts can overcome whatever schemes

    10           are in place.  So the question is, is there some reasonable,

    11           appropriate and effective measures, and the Justice

    12           Department has said it, both in this case as well as the

    13           collateral case up in New York, that there are those measures

    14           available today.  The key is to put the burden on the content

    15           provider to do something rather than nothing.  Because

    16           nothing means that left to its own devices, the parental

    17           control software just won't be effective.

    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I understand that, but you're

    19           saying that something as just simply tagging his material or

    20           in --

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But the something -- what does the

    22           something get you?  That's what I'm getting at.

    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yes, that's what I --

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The something that Compuserve did --

    25           we don't have to hypothesize anymore.  They did something and


                    


                                                                           155

     1           it got them headlines in their local newspaper, in the

     2           Washington Times and other newspapers that A, undoubtedly was

     3           a catastrophe in the corporate life, and B, hurt their

     4           business according to Mr. Ennis, which is at least a credible

     5           hypothesis that it would do that.  That's what you get paid. 

     6           If you're wrong, you're going to find that your company or

     7           your organization is going to be the subject of a headline

     8           saying that you're peddling smut.

     9                    MR. BARON:  And I would submit to you, Judge

    10           Dalzell, that Compuserve might have a problem today under

    11           existing statutes going to obscenity independent of the

    12           Communications Decency Act.  That might be the reason for the

    13           headline as well.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All I can do is take your colleague

    15           in another division at his word.  And he cited the

    16           Communications Decency Act.  He did not cite 1864 or 1865. 

    17           He cited the CDA.  So I'm taking him at his word, that's all

    18           I'm doing.

    19                    MR. BARON:  But the correspondence that is of record

    20           in this action does explicitly say that the actions that were

    21           taken by the Department of Justice in the sort of initial

    22           look at this is possibly for obscenity provisions, not just

    23           223(d).  It does say that in the correspondence.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, not the one that I saw, but

    25           that's all right.  Move on.


                    


                                                                           156

     1                    MR. BARON:  It's a letter to Mr. Ennis signed by

     2           Terry Lord that is at Exhibit 3 --

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I'm looking at the April 29th letter

     4           --

     5                    MR. BARON:  Right.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- the April 29th letter that was

     7           sent to --

     8                    MR. BARON:  There is a further letter.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- to the complainant --

    10                    MR. BARON:  Right, there is a further letter at the

    11           top of Exhibit 3 to plaintiff's motion which does indicate

    12           that citizen complaints can be reviewed to the extent they

    13           may relate to other possible Title 18 violations.  And that's

    14           really a key to understanding what's going on there.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Could I ask you the key -- well,

    16           maybe one key.  Is it your position, the Government's

    17           position, not personally, that a content provider could avoid

    18           criminal liability by tagging its material, or would some

    19           other action also be necessary?

    20                    MR. BARON:  Merely tagging by itself, just doing the

    21           four key strokes, -L18 or putting a PICs-compatible label or

    22           self-labeling is today not fully sufficient because you have

    23           to do something more.  The browsers of the marketplace have

    24           not been tweaked or tuned to get that label.

    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, but what does the content


                    


                                                                           157

     1           provider have to do with the browsers, in that example?  I

     2           mean I'm a content provider, I put on there -L18, there you

     3           are.

     4                    MR. BARON:  Right.

     5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Now, I can't help it the browsers

     6           aren't configured out there in the market.

     7                    MR. BARON:  Well, that may be right, but the fact is

     8           that the evidence by plaintiff's own case shows that the

     9           browsers are going to move to a PICs-compatible labeling

    10           format which fully assimilates the alternative suggestions of

    11           character strings.

    12                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  But the point that Judge Sloviter

    13           made, I think, is that it is sufficient.  All a person has to

    14           do, a speaker, is to put -L18.  I'm using that example, and

    15           that's enough.

    16                    MR. BARON:  We have said in our briefs that on the

    17           condition that the marketplace has moved and the testimony

    18           before you says that it will imminently, then it would be an

    19           affirmative defense.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Baron --

    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  That's the --

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- the official position of the

    23           department.  The official position of the department was

    24           expressed by the Acting Assistant Attorney General, the

    25           Criminal Division, to our three colleagues in New York on May


                    


                                                                           158

     1           3, 1996.  And the most he would say is, and I quote, "Under

     2           present technology, it is the position of the Department of

     3           Justice that, absent extraordinary circumstances, such

     4           efforts would constitute substantial evidence that a content

     5           provider had taken good faith, reasonable, effective and

     6           appropriate actions under the circumstances to restrict or

     7           prevent access by minors to the covered material."  Do you

     8           find that comforting if you were advising a client?  Oh,

     9           don't worry, here's a letter from Mr. Keeney (ph).  It just

    10           says that the jury might acquit you.  It doesn't say you

    11           won't be indicted, does it?

    12                    MR. BARON:  Well, your Honor, that's not the

    13           statute.  As plaintiffs would have you rule on it, what they

    14           are asking you to say is to strike down the statute because

    15           it doesn't as a per se matter establish in all cases what

    16           individuals can do.  But the statutory scheme, not only in

    17           E5, but in the E6 provision, which talks about the FCC

    18           describing measures which are reasonable, effective and

    19           appropriate and that the use of such measures shall be

    20           admitted as evidence of good faith efforts for purposes of

    21           paragraph 5, the statute is written in the terms of 

    22           evidence --

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You mean the same FCC that gave us

    24           the Merrill Hansen (ph) decision, that said that the purpose

    25           was just one of many factors to consider.


                    


                                                                           159

     1                    MR. BARON:  The Congress broadly prescribed that the

     2           FCC has a role that it may describe these measures.  Along

     3           the way, the Department of Justice has in the context of this

     4           action, as well as the collateral proceeding in New York,

     5           sought to further make concrete what it is that content

     6           providers can do.  And they said it, that if you do these

     7           measures it will be absent extraordinary circumstances,

     8           substantial evidence of having an affirmative defense.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Baron --

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It doesn't say we won't prosecute

    11           you.

    12                    MR. BARON:  But that's not what the structure of the

    13           statute is either.  So --

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, in a First Amendment setting

    15           surely you would agree with me that the chilling effect of

    16           prosecution is something we need to consider.

    17                    MR. BARON:  Of course, you may consider chilling

    18           effect in First Amendment cases.  But the -- but what

    19           plaintiffs would have you do is penalize the Congress by

    20           striking a statute which is very broadly worded with respect

    21           to reasonable, effective and appropriate actions.  And we've

    22           set to put flesh on that both in our briefs and in Mr.

    23           Keeney's letter which is not inconsistent with the briefs

    24           that we've filed in this action.

    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  It may be broadly worded but it's


                    


                                                                           160

     1           impossible to comply with, it seems to me, under the evidence

     2           that I've heard, except by virtue of the letter which you now

     3           say or someone says it's -- that mere labeling will be

     4           sufficient compliance.  But --

     5                    MR. BARON:  Not only is it not impossible to comply

     6           with, it's very easy to comply with.  Plaintiff's whole case

     7           is--

     8                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  The defenses are easy to comply

     9           with?

    10                    MR. BARON:  That the -- that the defenses, if the

    11           content providers who are putting a material that is sexually

    12           explicit within the definition of the CDA out into cyberspace

    13           in various forms, if they take just simple measures to ensure

    14           that the world knows that they're there, the Department of

    15           Justice is saying that that's substantial evidence of an

    16           affirmative defense.

    17                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  That's not what the act says

    18           though.  My point is that's not what the act says, that's

    19           what the Department of Justice says.

    20                    MR. BARON:  Well, we have keyed our defense of this

    21           act to the broadly worded provisions of E(5)(A) as well as

    22           the conference report that talks about a content selection

    23           standards.

    24                    And I asked Dr. Olsen whether his scheme was a

    25           content selection standard, it is.  The self-labeling scheme


                    


                                                                           161

     1           that's embodied as part of the PICs methodology is a type of

     2           content selection scheme for content providers.  Congress set

     3           it out, we're not departing or going further afield than

     4           what's in the conference report.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We have before us a motion for

     6           preliminary injunction.  It seems to me that you are arguing

     7           in your defense argument that there will be a way in due

     8           course in which one could comply with the statute because the

     9           brow-- the market -- and in your brief, the market will rise

    10           to the occasion, et cetera.

    11                    Inasmuch as all we're dealing with is what is

    12           available now because we're dealing with a preliminary

    13           injunction, why doesn't the Government concede that a

    14           preliminary injunction would be appropriate and wait for the

    15           permanent hearing until those matters become available so

    16           that they can be tested and see if even -- I mean these are

    17           the product of Mr. Olsen's creative imagination -- Dr.

    18           Olsen's creative imagination.  They may work and they may not

    19           work.

    20                    But at the moment we haven't seen anything that does

    21           work that wouldn't also effectively block some of the

    22           material from adults.  And therefore why this big challenge

    23           to the preliminary injunction part of it until the market

    24           catches up?

    25                    MR. BARON:  Well, we -- I have several responses to


                    


                                                                           162

     1           that.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, and I'd be interested.

     3                    MR. BARON:  It's not Dr. Olsen's imagination, it is

     4           the testimony of plaintiff's own witnesses, both with respect

     5           to Mr. Bradner's extensive testimony on the standards and

     6           protocols of the Internet and Mr. Vace's testimony about the

     7           W-3 consortium.

     8                    There is a creative genius in the Internet other

     9           than Dr. Olsen's own creativity.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, but Dr. Olsen's plan depends

    11           on the content provider doing this whereas, as I understand

    12           it, the PICs plan necessarily involves the receiver who is

    13           willing -- 

    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, a proxy --

    15                    MR. BARON:  Or third-party labeling services, a

    16           complex scheme --

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So there's a -- I think that --

    18           yeah.  That's a very big difference.

    19                    MR. BARON:  -- where parents would be relying on any

    20           number of sources other than the content providers, that the

    21           burden is not on the content provider to do anything,

    22           although it allows for it, but that Congress would require

    23           it.

    24                    To respond to the point, this --

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I mean how can we sustain it today


                    


                                                                           163

     1           based on some hypothetical catching up in the marketplace in

     2           the future?  Is really what I'm troubled about.

     3                    MR. BARON:  I would hope, your Honors, that an

     4           aspect of your decision would be an acknowledgement of the

     5           substantial, if not overwhelming, testimony that the

     6           marketplace is poised to provide a tagging scheme which would

     7           be a defense under the CDA so that the marketplace, this

     8           litigation and the marketplace will catch up with each other. 

     9           But short of --

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Nobody -- nobody said it was really

    11           working, as I -- I mean except for soft spots which I, but my

    12           reaction was it was pretty minuscule, as you pointed out in

    13           cross-examination, in the marketplace, this all is including

    14           PICs, something that is supposedly about to happen that all

    15           sorts of things can happen that will affect that.

    16                    And I, just as a practical matter, they put on

    17           evidence or testimony of chill or possible -- of chill and

    18           that certainly is credible testimony, how can -- how can we

    19           as a matter of judicial responsibility sustain against that

    20           chill on the basis of what isn't there now?  And that's my

    21           basic question to you as on the defenses.

    22                    MR. BARON:  Well, obviously if the Court were

    23           inclined to say there are no available defense under E(5)(A),

    24           then one -- as of today, then one possible action is to

    25           suspend implementation of E(5)(A) as opposed to E(5)(B), for


                    


                                                                           164

     1           a period of time pending development of the tagging schemes

     2           in the marketplace.

     3                    But I am not willing, as I stand here, to concede

     4           that the other available means set out in our brief, which

     5           include registration or posting to limited participation

     6           forums or other matters that are set out -- 

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  For the credit cards, but of course

     8           the people who do that already are the people who are the

     9           pornographers.

    10                    MR. BARON:  Well, and there were a variety of other,

    11           right, and access codes and third-party registration.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So the only thing that you're going

    13           to prevent if the CDA is sustained are the teasers.

    14                    MR. BARON:  I would beg to differ, your Honor,

    15           because there has been testimony from Dr. Olsen, and I

    16           realize that there is cross testimony on this, that there are

    17           a number of content providers or organizations, non-profits,

    18           who can put in place third-party registration schemes as a

    19           technical matter or come up with other types of access

    20           restriction and proxy server schemes.  His extensive

    21           declaration on that is part of the record. 

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Let's take Mr. Kuromiya's group

    23           which is a non-profit group which as I recalled his

    24           testimony, of very modest means, okay.  So for credit card

    25           identification, the evidence is that unless it's accompanied


                    


                                                                           165

     1           by a commercial transaction, the verifier is going to charge

     2           you something.

     3                    I think he testified that there were -- just pick a

     4           number, 20,000 hits a month, okay?  That's $20,000 right

     5           there, that's $240,000 per annum that I suspect this

     6           organization doesn't have for credit card identification.

     7                    Now, wouldn't you agree with me that Mr. Kuromiya's

     8           group, that credit card identification is a non-starter for

     9           him?

    10                    MR. BARON:  Uh, I --

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because it would come out of their

    12           pocket.

    13                    MR. BARON:  I'm not sure I would want to concede all

    14           the hypothetical facts in that because, as the Court is well

    15           aware, there has been substantial testimony about what hits

    16           mean and how it actually translates into real individuals

    17           where you would have to do a verification.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So whether it's 16,407 people

    19           instead of 20,000, it's still more money than he has.

    20                    MR. BARON:  I would concede that the credit card

    21           defense may not be available to each and every individual who

    22           is a content provider, that is correct.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And in fact, since we're talking

    24           about Mr. Kuromiya's group, he wants to reach people under

    25           18.  So is that an admission for the Grand Jury?  And you


                    


                                                                           166

     1           know he's going to show them some very graphic depictions of,

     2           as I understand it, the male sexual organ, at least the male

     3           sexual organ.  Okay?  He wants to do that and he's probably

     4           going to do it in a titillating and pandering way because he

     5           wants to get their attention, that's his purpose.

     6                    MR. BARON:  Well, I want to put --

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So should we say to him get, you

     8           know, we'll give you the guidebook to Federal correctional

     9           institutions?

    10                    MR. BARON:  Well, I want to put aside as a legal

    11           matter for this, for the purposes of this part of the

    12           discussion whether or not he -- his actions would meet or not

    13           meet the legal standard of patent offensiveness.

    14                    But he certainly does have a variety of means today

    15           to segregate out that portion of his site and perhaps use a

    16           third-party registration scheme or some other scheme short of

    17           merely relying on tagging.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No, perhaps I'm not being clear

    19           enough.  He doesn't want to block to people under 18, he

    20           wants to reach them.  They're sexually active, he just

    21           doesn't want them to die of AIDS, that's all.  So he wants to

    22           reach them, he wants to entice them to learn about safe sex.

    23                    MR. BARON:  I can't respond to an individual --

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is that bad faith on his part?

    25                    MR. BARON:  -- who doesn't want to take advantage of


                    


                                                                           167

     1           the affirmative defenses, notwithstanding a known quantity

     2           that he might otherwise be liable under the act.  But let 

     3           me--

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So he ought to just take his

     5           chances.

     6                    MR. BARON:  But let me say this: the only proposal

     7           that the Court has heard as an alternative to putting the

     8           burden on content providers that is -- that comes in any way,

     9           shape or form in terms of effectiveness is a proposal to

    10           block the entire Internet based on unrated sites. And if Mr.

    11           Kuromiya doesn't want to rate his site or take any other

    12           affirmative action, his site would be blocked under Mr.

    13           Ennis' theory of --

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Ah.

    15                    MR. BARON:  -- the PICs compatible label.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But that's because the parents of

    17           the under 18 year old user have made that decision, a very

    18           big difference, you would admit, than the Government making

    19           that decision for them.

    20                    MR. BARON:  Well, the fact is that the scheme, I

    21           mean the ironic position of the parties before the Court

    22           today is that we want the Internet to be available to

    23           children based on the findings of Congress that said this is

    24           a dramatic, wonderful medium of educational value.  And if

    25           you look at the proposal to block everything, it makes no


                    


                                                                           168

     1           sense.  99.9 percent of the Internet or thereabouts, as Dr.

     2           Olsen testified, would be blocked if you're merely relying on

     3           third-party labeling schemes such as envisioned by PICs to

     4           label a few thousand or even tens of thousands of URL's.

     5                    Professor Hoffman's testimony was at last check

     6           there are 22 million URL's just on the World Wide Web.  There

     7           is testimony in this action that the World Wide Web is

     8           growing every two months, that the Internet is doubling nine

     9           to -- every nine to twelve months.

    10                    The third-party labeling schemes such as envisioned

    11           just can't keep up and anybody can do the mathematics to show

    12           that the effect of a PICs scheme that blocks sites is going

    13           to block virtually everything.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So it's better for Mr. Kuromiya to

    15           bear the risk of going to a Federal correctional institution

    16           because he guesses wrong?

    17                    MR. BARON:  Uh --

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  As apparently Compuserve guessed

    19           wrong.

    20                    MR. BARON:  Your Honor, I just will not concede that

    21           Mr. Kuromiya is within the scope of the act for the purpose

    22           of this discussion.  And if he doesn't want to avail himself

    23           of any access measures, well, then -- then he can take the

    24           consequences.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You referred us to 5(B) as an -- I


                    


                                                                           169

     1           think you said, well, if 5(A) is not effectively available

     2           right now, they still have 5(B).

     3                    Is 5(B) available, just fill me in on this, to chat

     4           groups and news groups and -- or is it the 5(B) being credit

     5           card, debit account, adult access code or adult personal

     6           identification number.  There are lots of speakers back and

     7           forth in this whole other area, other than the commercial

     8           pornographers.  Is 5(B) directed toward them?

     9                    MR. BARON:  There may be -- there are applications

    10           that non-commercial providers can avail themselves when

    11           they're in those applications that some of these defenses

    12           might make sense.  It might make sense based on available

    13           software on a particular proprietary chat room to have an

    14           access code, for example.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But you agree that by and large

    16           these are not effectively available to most chat rooms and

    17           you know the stuff, news groups, is that what they're called?

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right, right.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Chat rooms.

    20                    MR. BARON:  Well, they have to parse it by

    21           application but there, certainly there the availability

    22           differs by the various applications.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I understood your brief to say that

    24           it was mostly designed for --

    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  For Web sites and bulletin


                    


                                                                           170

     1           boards, isn't that right, for --

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Commercial, yes.

     3                    MR. BARON:  It is certainly possible to utilize

     4           E(5)(B) for Web sites and bulletin boards and certainly in

     5           the commercial context it's done all the time.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, as a matter of law, if you are

     7           telling us that we should sustain this -- I mean we do deal

     8           with law -- if you are telling us that we should sustain the

     9           statute based on the availability of defenses and defense

    10           5(A) is not effectively available now and defense 5(B) covers

    11           at most only some but not most of the Internet users, then

    12           would we be effectively, as your brief seemed to suggest, at

    13           least to me, cutting the statute down to apply only to the

    14           commercial type user and then we would put in the discussion

    15           with Mr. Coppolino who was really purveying pornographic

    16           material?

    17                    MR. BARON:  You could certainly, short of striking

    18           the statute, you could parse the statute in that manner.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Isn't that what we would have to do

    20           based on what you say in your brief?

    21                    MR. BARON:  Well, your Honor, let me go back.  I

    22           understand that there is difficulty accepting an argument

    23           that because of the marketplace being poised to do something

    24           and the widespread availability today not being there, that

    25           the main proposal, which is the elegant, simple proposal that


                    


                                                                           171

     1           we put forward may not be an available defense.

     2                    But we've suggested alternatives and I am not

     3           willing to stand here and concede that notions of letting

     4           your site be known in cyberspace through the registration

     5           process that we've suggested, the multiple ways that you can

     6           make it known isn't an available defense that the Justice

     7           Department would take as substantial evidence en route to

     8           where we're going to be in a couple of months time which is

     9           widespread availability of tagging schemes.

    10                    Well, your Honor, with all --

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Maybe, I mean, you know.

    12                    MR. BARON:  Well, we've heard evidence of the --

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And we saw that they couldn't get,

    14           what couldn't we get on the -- oh, we couldn't get London or

    15           something.

    16                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  We couldn't get Paris so we

    17           settled for London.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We couldn't get Paris.

    19                    MR. BARON:  No, there are --

    20                    (Laughter.)

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, I mean all I'm suggesting is

    22           that -- and it wasn't really facetious.  All I'm suggesting

    23           is that technology doesn't always go where you expect it to

    24           go.  Space ships blow up, also, I mean, so we cannot assume

    25           that something will work until it has actually worked.


                    


                                                                           172

     1                    MR. BARON:  But we're -- 

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I mean -- 

     3                    MR. BARON:  But your Honor --

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And that's all I'm -- I'm

     5           suggesting.

     6                    MR. BARON:  With all due respect, we are not

     7           operating in a vacuum where I'm making an oral argument prior

     8           to an evidentiary hearing.  We have had five days of

     9           testimony.  We have a consortium --

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And all we got was hypotheticals so

    11           that we expect that this will be available.  I'm -- I'm

    12           looking, I went through this evidence afterwards, based on

    13           your brief, and I'm looking for specific examples of

    14           operating systems in which your defenses would actually work,

    15           not based on something that might happen if you put X

    16           together with Y, but this is really working.  

    17                    And except for Surfwatch which you kept pointing out

    18           was minuscule, there isn't anything that's actually working

    19           that you can point to, to say to a potential defendant: use

    20           that.  Is there?

    21                    MR. BARON:  Well, I would disagree with that.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, what -- what would you point

    23           us to in the evidence?

    24                    MR. BARON:  I mean the findings that plaintiffs have

    25           put in and the evidence of record would suggest that there


                    


                                                                           173

     1           are other parental controls.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But what do you point us to?

     3                    MR. BARON:  I can point you to the fact that the

     4           major on-line providers either do or are about to implement--

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Are not about to.  Do now --

     6                    MR. BARON:  -- parental controls.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  This is the preliminary injunction,

     8           what do they do now?

     9                    MR. BARON:  For Compuserve or Prodigy, Cyber Patrol

    10           is present.  So it's a large subscriber base and there are,

    11           there are a variety of parental control software products

    12           that are out there.  What we are suggesting is they are

    13           known, they're known to the plaintiffs in this courtroom.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But the parental control software

    15           doesn't provide a defense to the content provider, does it?

    16                    MR. BARON:  I believe it, not by itself because it

    17           doesn't work by itself because of delays and because of the

    18           inefficiencies in relying on just sort of an ad hoc matter

    19           for them to pick up sites, as we've got abundant evidence. 

    20                    But what the -- the act puts the burden, Congress

    21           put the burden on those that would put inappropriate material

    22           for children up in cyberspace.  And we should let that burden

    23           stay where it is and make those individuals do something.

    24                    And what the -- we have suggested is that en route

    25           to the widespread availability of a tagging scheme which, as


                    


                                                                           174

     1           Dr. Olsen said, take four hours for Netscape to change their

     2           proxy server to get 80 percent of the market and those kind

     3           of actions, en route to that there are actions that the

     4           providers can take today.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Wait a minute, to beat a live 

     6           horse--

     7                    (Laughter.)

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- Compuserve has used available

     9           options and they're being reviewed, investigated by the FBI. 

    10           It's not over.

    11                    MR. BARON:  I just will not accept that as a good

    12           example because of the particular circumstances of the

    13           referral being potentially on obscenity and we've cleared it

    14           up in a letter.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Even though the April 29 letter

    16           never mentions it?

    17                    MR. BARON:  Your Honor, well, the prior colloquy

    18           would establish.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No, we have to be -- this is deadly

    20           serious to Compuserve, you know, deadly serious.

    21                    MR. BARON:  And I would suggest that --

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And that's why a preliminary

    23           injunction, you know, we have to do these things to get at

    24           this now because it's having effects now.  If we had any

    25           doubt about it, we just read the Columbus Dispatch of the


                    


                                                                           175

     1           last two days, right?

     2                    MR. BARON:  Well, your Honor, the --there are

     3           existing laws on the books about obscenity that are being

     4           flouted by individuals, not just in cyberspace, but I mean

     5           the fact is that there's a lot of stuff that would meet the

     6           obscenity statutes independent of the passage of this act.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Of course, and nobody is arguing

     8           about that here.

     9                    MR. BARON:  And the individuals are putting it up in

    10           cyberspace and, you know, they may or may not be prosecuted. 

    11           Not everybody who drives over 55 miles an hour gets a ticket.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank heavens.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right.

    14                    (Laughter.)

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All I can tell you, Mr. Baron, is

    16           when your colleague, Mr. Moore, wrote to Mr. Truman on April

    17           29, 1996, the only statute he cited was to CDA, the only one.

    18                    MR. BARON:  But -- but, your Honors, as a matter of

    19           law the Communications Decency Act did amend obscenity

    20           provisions and other provisions that are now part of this

    21           litigation.  And so I mean it could be fairly read as that.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So maybe in the Communications Act.

    23                    MR. BARON:  Well, it could be read as --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  At the risk of incurring Judge

    25           Dalzell's forever anger, let me get you to another point off


                    


                                                                           176

     1           of the Compuserve.  And that is you have in your brief, you

     2           say in your brief, you make the argument that chat rooms

     3           because that -- go back to my -- and other four that contain

     4           indecent material could be segregated to adult areas by -- of

     5           cyberspace, I don't understand that argument.  Would you

     6           explain?  Is that what you meant when you said in our brief

     7           we raise some others?  I don't understand --

     8                    MR. BARON:  Well, there's --

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What testimony you're relying on

    10           for that and what it would do.

    11                    MR. BARON:  There -- there are other actions that

    12           could be taken --

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But you mentioned that one.  Where

    14           does that appear in the testimony?

    15                    MR. BARON:  The -- the stipulation of the parties

    16           and Dr. Olsen's declaration talks about various other

    17           applications that you could have limited participation areas

    18           or forums whereby you have a known list of people who have a

    19           part of that cyberspace forum.  It's a limited application. 

    20           But I'm not suggesting --

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, wait a minute, would it need

    22           to have a gatekeeper, a live gatekeeper in order -- you know,

    23           in order to -- somebody -- is that what you mean?  I guess

    24           I'm trying to find out what you mean by this.

    25                    MR. BARON:  It certainly could have a live


                    


                                                                           177

     1           gatekeeper who allows access into a forum depending on

     2           whether one is an adult.  You wouldn't have to have a live

     3           gatekeeper, you could set up something else. 

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, how do they find out if one is

     5           an adult?

     6                    MR. BARON:  Through either supplying credit card or

     7           virtual card over the Net or other means by which --

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But suppose it's not commercial so

     9           you wouldn't have a credit card?  I'm just trying, you know,

    10           it's vague, I'm trying to put it all together.

    11                    MR. BARON:  There are a number --

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I'd like to sustain this but give

    13           me arguments based on your record.  Go ahead.

    14                    MR. BARON:  Well, there are a num-- number of forms. 

    15           We have set out in the stipulation so the parties, beginning

    16           that they were moderated forums but there's also limited

    17           participation forums on list serves or one can set out news

    18           groups that are of limited participation or in chat rooms

    19           that allow for only adults to be admitted by a gatekeeper or

    20           otherwise.  But --

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, you mean a gatekeeper?

    22                    MR. BARON:  Yeah.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, you also suggest that --

    24                    MR. BARON:  I'm not suggesting that's a widespread

    25           solution to all the problems in cyberspace, it's a secondary


                    


                                                                           178

     1           matter that can be taken care of in certain applications.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You also suggest that where a proxy

     3           server would be a vehicle that would operate with the

     4           tagging.  What is the current technology that would enable a

     5           trusted proxy to obtain the relevant age information and

     6           whose testimony do you rely on?

     7                    MR. BARON:  Well, Dr. Olsen testified about the

     8           ability to set up proxy servers to receive tags and also to

     9           have access codes or hash codes, other type of methods could

    10           be set up on particular Web sites to allow for adults coming

    11           in.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Right, but with all due respect to

    13           Dr. Olsen, this is all his hypothetical --  I mean he was, he

    14           was really talking as a hypothetical analyst, this could

    15           happen and this could happen and the other could happen, is

    16           that not correct?

    17                    MR. BARON:  Yes. 

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And there's no evidence that it's

    19           currently feasible and happening, is there?

    20                    MR. BARON:  Uhm --

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If there is I'd like to know where

    22           it is.

    23                    MR. BARON:  Right.  No, there isn't evidence that

    24           these plaintiffs have put these particular measures into

    25           effect, but the evidence suggests that it would be easy to do


                    


                                                                           179

     1           so and they could avail themselves of the 223(E)(5)(A)

     2           provisions for doing so.

     3                    Obviously it may not be available in all cases. 

     4           That's why we have emphasized the tagging and registration

     5           scheme as a way en route to a better solution which is

     6           feasible under the whatever available technology there is to,

     7           as the way by which content providers can avail themselves of

     8           a remedy.

     9                    I'm not sure how much --

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And the tagging scheme is something

    11           that Dr. Olsen thought of after you hired him as an expert as

    12           I think the questions brought out when he testified?

    13                    MR. BARON:  He certainly amplified on a tagging

    14           scheme which was suggested itself by the legislative history

    15           which suggested content selection standards and other

    16           available measures would be an affirmative defense.

    17                    So we weren't inventing something out of whole

    18           cloth, we are hooked to the conference report that suggests

    19           that measures which plaintiffs here know very much about,

    20           given that they represent some of the people that are behind

    21           the PICs standard, can effectuate.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But just in terms of the defense, if

    23           Bianca's Smut Shack were to tag itself minus L-18, that

    24           doesn't advance the ball one bit, does it, until the software

    25           is out there?


                    


                                                                           180

     1                    MR. BARON:  Well, Bianca's Cage actually does

     2           represent affirmative actions which have been taken by a

     3           content provider to provide their IP address, their computer

     4           address in cyberspace to the unknowns for blocking purposes. 

     5           And that, I would submit, is an action which comes within

     6           what we suggested at Page 62 of our brief as well as in Mr.

     7           Keeney's letter as something that an affirmative action that

     8           someone has done.

     9                    Now, it would have to be evaluated.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But it has to be effective, doesn't

    11           it?  You have to, in order to avail yourself of the defense,

    12           it has to be effective, doesn't it?

    13                    MR. BARON:  Well, she has given notice in some sense

    14           to the world that -- that that page exists.  And we are not

    15           suggesting that the burden is great with respect to

    16           individuals.  There are --

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But how does that keep under 18's

    18           from accessing it?

    19                    MR. BARON:  Because the--

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, that's exactly what I'm getting

    21           at.

    22                    MR. BARON:  Because it notify-- because it does

    23           provide for some notification where she hasn't done -- she

    24           hasn't availed herself of all the kinds of steps that we set

    25           forth in both the letter and our brief, but the fact is that


                    


                                                                           181

     1           there is some notification to the world of the blocking

     2           software that's out there today so as it can be effectively

     3           blocked from sectors of -- of -- that are either subscribed

     4           to various ISP's or on-line services.

     5                    It doesn't -- I'm not going to represent --

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  How do you block -- yeah --

     7                    MR. BARON:  -- that it's blocked for everybody.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But how do you block for Judge

     9           Dalzell's ten year old and at the same time let Judge Dalzell

    10           see it, if he wants to?

    11                    MR. BARON:  The parents and would be availing

    12           themselves of the turning on or off the software or the

    13           browser that existed to either block or not block that site. 

    14           But they wouldn't even know.  What if, just imagine, as I've

    15           said, we are talking about a vast realm here, it's impressed

    16           all the different applications, the Internet.  This is a

    17           complex area where it's not just one size fits all, there are

    18           lots of applications.  The fact is that through the

    19           affirmative actions that content providers could take, they

    20           can make a difference.  And maybe they can't make as

    21           effective a difference today as if I were back here in July

    22           with the PICs standard having been adopted by Netscape and

    23           Microsoft.

    24                    I assure you that if I were here in July and that--

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You may be, you know, one way or


                    


                                                                           182

     1           the other for a permanent injunction.  You know, we're going

     2           to -- whatever happens they'll ask for a permanent

     3           injunction, I guess.

     4                    MR. BARON:  As long as they employ me at the

     5           Department of Justice and I'm still on the case, I'll be back

     6           here.  The fact is I may be back here --

     7                    (Laughter.)

     8                    MR. BARON:  -- and arguing that there isn't a more

     9           effective solution than what we argued at the preliminary

    10           injunction hearing, but that's not to say that there isn't

    11           something that content providers can do.

    12                    And again the irony is that it would be plaintiffs--

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But it's not a negligence suit.  I

    14           think what Judge Dal-- what's been bothering, you know, Judge

    15           Dalzell is, one, we're not sure that the U.S. Attorney's

    16           Office in all of the districts is as reasonable as you and

    17           Mr. Coppolino have been in the course of this litigation.

    18                    MR. BARON:  Well, I -- your Honor, it is not just --

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And there isn't --

    20                    MR. BARON:  -- Mr. Coppolino and I, it is Mr. Keeney

    21           who is the acting Assistant Attorney General for all the

    22           District Courts in the United States --

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well --

    24                    MR. BARON:  -- for all U.S. Attorneys making this

    25           representation.


                    


                                                                           183

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And Mr. Lord.

     2                    MR. BARON:  Yes.  And individual cases may be

     3           investigated under their facts and circumstances.  Now,

     4           obviously not under the stipulation for this --

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, investigation is not a

     6           prosecution, so I mean, you know, that I'm -- that troubles

     7           me a little less, frankly, than, you know, anybody, the FBI

     8           can investigate anybody and, you know, I'm not concerned

     9           about that although there might be a chill involved in that

    10           as well. 

    11                    Go ahead, Mr. Baron.

    12                     MR. BARON:  Well, I would hope not because it's an

    13           isolated case and I'd hope that there wouldn't be.  And we

    14           are adhering to the stipulation that the Court entered.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We don't -- we don't deny that,

    16           yeah.  Or I don't think the plaintiffs deny that, I don't

    17           know.  Go ahead.

    18                    MR. BARON:  I would submit to your Honors that we

    19           are proposing simple solutions.  What plaintiffs are

    20           proposing are very complex ones.  We have pointed out--

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, the plaintiff wants to declare

    22           the statute unconstitutional, period. 

    23                    MR. BARON:  But the --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And that's not very complex, when

    25           you think about it.


                    


                                                                           184

     1                    MR. BARON:  -- solution --

     2                    (Laughter.)

     3                    MR. BARON:  The solution for -- for the problem

     4           represented that Congress was addressing is not to have

     5           parents absorb the costs and absorb the complexity of going

     6           out to third-party labeling schemes in the hope of catching  

     7           particular sites when there is simple actions that content

     8           providers can take.  That's the essence of our case.  We

     9           believe the affirmative defenses do work, that we have

    10           suggested a wide array of them, both for the future as well

    11           as for the present, we believe that those defense -- the

    12           actions that content providers can take certainly represent

    13           more effective deterrent than relying on Surfwatch alone.

    14                    And, for that reason, I'd submit that the

    15           affirmative defense provisions should be upheld and the CDA

    16           should be upheld.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I don't know whether you or Mr.

    18           Coppolino are dealing with the question of the simply talking

    19           about defenses.  In your brief at Page 37, Footnote 5 and the

    20           text associated with it, you heap ashes on Ms. Warren's

    21           concern about a prosecution and you ridicule her statement

    22           that, quote, "All that is needed is for some person or group

    23           of people in some community in the United States to have a

    24           problem with my existence on line and to come to the Justice

    25           Department with a complaint," close quote, as though that's


                    


                                                                           185

     1           not depicting reality, that she shouldn't worry about that.

     2                    Of course, isn't that exactly what happened with

     3           Compuserve?

     4                    MR. BARON:  Oh, I --

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  A group went to the Justice

     6           Department with a complaint?

     7                    MR. BARON:  There may be complaints, your Honor,

     8           that is not a reason for striking down a statute and a facial

     9           challenge.  These cases have to be -- there is -- there are

    10           powerful reasons to let the CDA be upheld and let the

    11           marketplace and its creative genius as represented by many of

    12           the plaintiffs and the organizations that are here in the

    13           court to make -- to ensure that there are measures that

    14           individuals can take.

    15                    And I submit that the briefing in this case is going

    16           to look a lot different six months or a year or two years

    17           from now because there will be, that if the CDA were upheld,

    18           that at least for on a preliminary basis subject to further

    19           proceedings, there will be a number of measures which I'm

    20           sure the plaintiff's community will come up with as well as,

    21           you know, others to ensure  that individuals can screen or

    22           block inappropriate material. 

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But doesn't the record show --

    24           doesn't the record show that they don't need a CDA for this,

    25           that the market forces are so powerful, they exist out there


                    


                                                                           186

     1           without a CDA.  Because parents like me and -- are worried

     2           about their ten year olds and twelve year olds and America On

     3           Line and Compuserve and all these other folks better have an

     4           answer soon or they're not going to have my business, or

     5           people like me.

     6                    So that they don't need a CDA to have that goad to

     7           come up with that technology, do they?

     8                    MR. BARON:  I think the --

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I mean that's the record that's been

    10           developed here.

    11                    MR. BARON:  It's -- and there -- we are, the two

    12           sides are not clashing completely on the issue of the -- the

    13           facts that there are parental controls and certainly we are

    14           relying in part that they do exist out there.  But we have

    15           also shown in the testimony Mr. Coppolino alluded to that

    16           through cross-examination of Ms. Duvall through Mr. Schmidt's

    17           testimony and through Dr. Olsen that the site, that the --

    18           that the third-party software mechanisms just can't keep up. 

    19           And there are -- there -- it's a flawed remedy and there is a

    20           tremendous amount of inappropriate material that will seep

    21           through.  And I think --

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But you know -- 

    23                    MR. BARON:  -- otherwise Congress is throwing up its

    24           hands.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well --


                    


                                                                           187

     1                    MR. BARON:  And it can't do anything.  I mean you

     2           heard here an unwillingness on the part of plaintiff's

     3           counsel to say that there was any effective legislation which

     4           they would substitute for the CDA.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I wouldn't expect them to come out,

     6           I wouldn't expect the American Civil Liberties Union, knowing

     7           its history, to come up with something that required self-

     8           tagging or to acquire some.  I mean it's just that's an

     9           unrealistic position.

    10                    But you knock their argument that we can use

    11           parental controls on the ground well, it's really, and not

    12           really effective and they won't be effective.  And yet I'll

    13           ask you the same question that I asked Mr. Coppolino, on the

    14           other hand you're asking us to sustain the statute based on

    15           defenses that are not even in being, much less I mean where

    16           the technology is not even in being much less not effective. 

    17           And we won't know whether it could be effective until it's

    18           tried and somebody doesn't come up and say to us: well, it

    19           isn't really going to work because some clever 16 year old

    20           knows how to get around it anyway.

    21                    Until it works we don't know how it -- until it

    22           exists, it isn't working  and until it works, we don't know

    23           how well it will work.

    24                    MR. BARON:  WEll, I --

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I mean tell me what's wrong in that


                    


                                                                           188

     1           problem statement of your position?

     2                    MR. BARON:  You have to accept that on

     3           representations going forth from defendants that there are

     4           measures which would constitute, absent extraordinary

     5           circumstances, substantial evidence of an affirmative defense

     6           today.  Mr. Keeney's letter says that as well as our brief.

     7                    If you accept that proposition, then in as applied

     8           challenges it will -- the law will develop.  And it will also

     9           develop that in short -- in very short order there will be an

    10           extremely effective solution as we suggested and as

    11           plaintiffs have alluded to.  So --

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I don't want to --

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  By the way -- by the way, for future

    14           reference in the event this act would be upheld and I'm

    15           instructing a jury as to burden of proof, who has the burden

    16           of proof as to these defenses, affirmative defenses, what's

    17           your position?

    18                    MR. BARON:  The Government always has, absent a

    19           statute, well, let me start again.  The Government has the

    20           ultimate burden of proof and -- but one would expect that a

    21           plaintiff -- I'm sorry, that a defendant in a criminal

    22           context would have to make some sort of showing that there is

    23           an affirmative defense --

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, they'd make a showing but then

    25           the burden of proof --


                    


                                                                           189

     1                    MR. BARON:  -- going forward.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- would go back to you to prove?

     3                    MR. BARON:  Yes.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That it was not --

     5                    MR. BARON:  Yes, unless there's unusual

     6           circumstances, statutory or otherwise, that would be the

     7           usual formulation.

     8                    I have no further questions -- or no further --

     9                    (Laughter.)

    10                    MR. BARON:  -- remarks to make, subject to your

    11           further questions.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, I will say, as I always do in

    13           the Court of Appeals, that questions do not indicate that the

    14           panel has reached any conclusion at all and the fact that we

    15           have asked both you and your colleague, Mr. Coppolino,

    16           pointed questions and that you have answered very well

    17           doesn't mean really -- you know, we just ate lunch, we didn't

    18           confer.

    19                    (Laughter.)

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.

    21                    MR. BARON:  All right, thank you.

    22                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honors, might I ask that we take a

    23           very brief recess between at this point so that Mr. Ennis and

    24           I can confer to determine whether we feel we need rebuttal

    25           argument and, if so --


                    


                                                                           190

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right, especially if you come

     2           back and you tell us you don't need rebuttal argument, five

     3           minutes.

     4                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, at least to make it more

     5           efficient.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

     7                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you. 

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is that all right?  No, five,

     9           let's, I mean you can do that in five minutes, can't you?

    10                    MR. HANSEN:  Absolutely. 

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, cause we...

    12                    (Court in recess; 2:46 to 2:55 o'clock p.m.)

<PRE>

    13                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, your Honor, I'm sorry, we weren't

    14           able to restrain ourselves completely from any rebuttal

    15           argument, but I think we've managed to make it quite -- both

    16           Mr. Ennis and I will be quite brief.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  How brief?

    18                    MR. HANSEN:  I will take less than -- if I got no

    19           questions I would use less than five minutes.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

    21                    MR. HANSEN:  If I get questions, I can't --

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You don't want equality? 

    23                    MR. HANSEN:  Certainly I can't speak, nor can I

    24           speak for Mr. Ennis as to how much time he's going to need.

    25                    I'd like to pick up on the discussion that the Court


                    


                                                                           191

     1           was having with Mr. Baron at the end in the nature of the

     2           changes in technology that may or may not occur over the next

     3           six months.  And I'd like to talk about how even if

     4           technology does in fact change over the next six months and

     5           even if we are back at a -- at the final injunction stage six

     6           months from now and PICs has come into place or PICs hasn't

     7           come into place, I think there are still two things that are

     8           enormously troubling about this statute and which I think the

     9           Court must necessarily wrestle with.

    10                    The first is the nature of the speech that is

    11           criminalized under this statute.  And if we had any doubt at

    12           all about the intent of Congress to reach valuable speech

    13           under this act, all we have to do is look at the statute.  At

    14           three separate occasions in the statute Congress reached out

    15           to say we intend the statute to apply to libraries and we

    16           intend the statute to apply to institutions of higher

    17           education.

    18                    Congress, I think, was making it unmistakably clear

    19           that they intended to reach out and criminalize --

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is that in 223?

    21                    MR. HANSEN:  It's at three separate occasions in the

    22           statute, your Honor.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, but it's a big statute, do

    24           you mean the two sections that --

    25                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes.


                    


                                                                           192

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  --  you are challenging?

     2                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes, yes, it is in the sections we're

     3           challenging.  The first place it appears is in the 223(F) in

     4           the definitional section.  You know, 223(H) in the

     5           definitional section where it talks about the term "library"

     6           means library -- means --

     7                    (Laughter.

     8                    MR. HANSEN:  -- means library is defined in another

     9           statute.  Earlier in -- and that's H.  Earlier in F there is

    10           a preemption clause which says "No state or local government

    11           may impose liability for commercial activities or actions by

    12           commercial entities, non-profit libraries or institutions of

    13           higher education that are different.  And then finally later

    14           there's another definition section defining interactive

    15           computer device which specifically also includes libraries

    16           and institutions of higher education.

    17                    Now, in addition to that, the Government's 

    18           proposal--

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Excuse me.

    20                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It says that but where does it-- I

    22           just want to know for my own benefit because we finally got

    23           it, you know, through the computer, I think.  Because up

    24           until now it's been a relatively new statute.

    25                    Where is the prior reference in those two sections


                    


                                                                           193

     1           to institutions of higher education and library?

     2                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, the -- the term interactive

     3           computer device is defined to include interactive computer

     4           devices used by libraries and institutions of higher

     5           education.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I see.

     7                    MR. HANSEN:  So the prior -- the cross-reference--

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That refers to A.

     9                    MR. HANSEN:  That's -- you're correct.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That would then refer to Subsection

    11           A where they use interactive computer things.  D?

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  D.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  

    14                    MR. HANSEN:  D, right, it refers to Subsection D,

    15           that's right.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Go ahead.

    17                    MR. HANSEN:  The second and final point I'd like to

    18           make concerning the nature of the speech here is that the

    19           Government's ultimate proposal is that technology will

    20           develop to appoint where they think it will be possible for

    21           speakers to label themselves as indecent speakers or not as

    22           indecent speakers.

    23                    They think it will become possible at a time when

    24           the Government can compel people to issue a label before they

    25           speak describing their speech as indecent or not indecent.


                    


                                                                           194

     1                    Even if that is to come to pass, the notion that the

     2           Government can impose upon all of us, upon the millions of

     3           people who use the Internet in the context of the Web, in the

     4           context of the news groups and chat rooms, the requirement

     5           that before we speak we label our speech as decent or

     6           indecent, in our view, represents a serious constitutional

     7           problem, one that is sufficient to justify this Court in

     8           declaring this statute unconstitutional, even in the event

     9           the technology comes about as the Government predicts.

    10                    Thank you, your Honors.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Thank you, Mr. Hansen.  

    12                    MR. ENNIS:  I'd like to make three brief points,

    13           your Honors.  The first is, is that with respect to news

    14           groups, chat rooms and lists or mail exploders, everyone

    15           agrees, including the Government's expert, that there is no

    16           technology available now, there is none in the pipeline,

    17           there is not going to be any here in July that makes it

    18           possible to speak in those forums by getting a credit card,

    19           an adult ID number, anything like that.  And I simply refer t

    20           he Court to our proposed findings of fact, 862, 883, 884,

    21           894, and 901 where that evidence is summarized.

    22                    Second, with respect to tagging, I think it's

    23           important to recall that the Government admitted here tagging

    24           is not a defense today because the browsers are not set to

    25           read those signals today.  But even if today all the browsers


                    


                                                                           195

     1           in the world were in place and set to read those tags, it's

     2           still not a defense.  At most, it's substantial evidence,

     3           it's not a defense.  It's not a truly safe harbor.  So we're

     4           not going to be in any different position in July from the

     5           position we're in right now.

     6                    Third, I think it would be strange indeed for this

     7           court to construe this statute to make tagging a defense

     8           because, as Mr. Hansen pointed out, any requirement that

     9           speakers self-label their own speech as a condition of

    10           speaking would violate the doctrine against compelled speech

    11           which was Meese v. King, Wooley v. Maynard, the Riley case. 

    12           Attaching a pejorative label to your own speech is something

    13           the First Amendment forbids the Government to require you to

    14           do.

    15                    And I think it's also not even necessary to reach

    16           that difficult constitutional question because as the NTEU

    17           case makes clear, you should never construe a statute in a

    18           way that would simply create a new First Amendment problem

    19           which requiring speaker self-tagging would do.

    20                    Furthermore, there's no reason to construe this

    21           statute that way because there's no reason to believe

    22           Congress had any intent whatsoever to require speaker self-

    23           labeling or tagging.

    24                    In fact, if you look at the Communications Decency

    25           Act, in the very next section of the same act passed by the


                    


                                                                           196

     1           same Congress on the same day, Congress specifically rejected

     2           speaker labeling of indecent or sexual speech by broadcast

     3           speakers, the medium that is the most amenable to

     4           Governmental regulation, precisely because Congress had

     5           serious concern whether they could constitutionally require

     6           broadcast speakers to self-label their own speech.

     7                    It's incredible in that context to think this

     8           Congress intended speaker self-labeling in the Internet

     9           context.

    10                    Thank you very much.

    11                    (Discussion off the record.)

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right, thank you all very much. 

    13           We will close the -- adjourn the hearing and you will hear

    14           from us.  The press seems to think it knows when we will

    15           decide this case, to my amazement.  It makes that -- those

    16           hypothetical, well, it makes that judgment without any

    17           communication with us and you will hear.  We know that there

    18           are some motions pending, but you will hear from us on all

    19           those matters in due course.  

    20                    Thank you very much.

    21                    I want to thank counsel very much.  I find that

    22           having come to the District Court level for this type of --

    23           counsel has been exceedingly cooperative, all counsel, and

    24           very helpful throughout and I do thank you all.

    25                    And you can show this part of the transcript to your


                    


                                                                           197

     1           superiors. 

     2                    (Laughter.)

     3                    COUNSEL:  Thank you, your Honor.

    21                    DANIEL OLSEN, Defendants' Witness, Previously Sworn,

    22           Resumed.

    23                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION

    24           BY MR. BARON:  

    25           Q   Good morning, Dr. Olsen.

                                                                             4

     1           A   Good morning.

     2           Q   You will recall that on Friday Mr. Ennis started off by

     3           asking you a series of questions about your technical

     4           expertise as it relates to the issues involved in this case,

     5           do you recall that?

     6           A   Yes, I do.

     7           Q   You received your PhD in 1981 from the University of

     8           Pennsylvania right here in Philadelphia, correct?

     9           A   That is correct.

    10           Q   And after more than ten years at Brigham Young University

    11           you have recently been appointed to be director of the Human

    12           Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie-Mellon University,

    13           correct?   

    14           A   That is correct.

    15           Q   What was your specific background and expertise that has

    16           led to this recent appointment?

    17           A   Carnegie-Mellon has one of the foremost computer science

    18           departments in the world, they saw a need to address the

    19           needs of people in using computers.  I have a long background

    20           of software expertise and how people use computers.

    21           Q   Now, with respect to your general expertise regarding

    22           technical matters involving the Internet let me first ask,

    23           have you ever created a new application that required

    24           software to communicate over the Internet?

    25           A   Yes.  Several years ago we were interested in what are

                                                                             5

     1           called multi-user interfaces, this is where multiple people

     2           interact simultaneously across the Internet.  To make that

     3           work we had to develop a new protocol for communication

     4           between those two applications.

     5           Q   Have you created software which integrates with the

     6           Worldwide Web?

     7           A   Yes.  I believe that there are two papers listed in my

     8           declaration where what we were interested in doing is

     9           enhancing the interactivity of the Worldwide Web.  It is

    10           currently somewhat restricted in what interactively you can

    11           do.  So, what we needed to do is take our user interfaces and

    12           be able to download them via the Web and have them

    13           automatically run on the user's machine, so that we could

    14           enhance that ability.  So, we built that software and

    15           integrated it with existing Web technology, yes.

    16           Q   Have you also created software that automates E-mail?

    17           A   Yes.  As part of that we were very interested in all of

    18           the various other Internet activities that we could integrate

    19           our software with.  One of the first ones we used was being

    20           able to from the user interface automatically generate E-mail

    21           of various kinds.

    22           Q   Would it be fair to say that in creating all of this

    23           software one needs a working familiarity with the standards

    24           and protocols used over the Internet?

    25           A   Yes.  I and my graduate students spent several months

                                                                             6

     1           studying those protocols and deciding how we could use them

     2           in -- as part of our software and what we would have to put

     3           in our software to be able to perform the same functions over

     4           the Internet.

     5           Q   Now, let's turn to the specific areas Mr. Ennis touched

     6           on regarding your expertise.  First, based on your knowledge

     7           of Surfwatch and other blocking software programs, and your

     8           general knowledge and expertise in the field of computer

     9           science, do you believe you are able to form an expert

    10           opinion on how Surfwatch purports to function?

    11           A   Yes.

    12           Q   Would you please tell the Court what you believe the

    13           level of expertise would be to form such an expert opinion?

    14           A   My opinion is based on two principles; one is called

    15           computational complexity, that is, how difficult

    16           computationally the problem is and what the nature of that

    17           problem is; and the other is general data base and

    18           communication technology.

    19           Q   Would your answer be the same for what technical

    20           expertise is necessary to evaluate parental-control software

    21           utilized by America Online?

    22           A   Yes.

    23           Q   The third area Mr. Ennis mentioned was with respect to

    24           direct or third-party verification of credit cards, do you

    25           recall that?

                                                                             7

     1           A   Yes, I do.

     2           Q   Dr. Olsen, are you familiar with the computer mechanisms

     3           that exist to process a transaction through Mastercard over

     4           the telephone?

     5           A   Yes, we did look in a particular instance with IC verify,

     6           we did look at exactly what a program, say, for example, a

     7           CGI program from a Web Browser would have to do in order --

     8           Q   Excuse me, you may need to explain CGI.

     9           A   CGI is the common gateway interface.  One of the

    10           particularly nice features of the Worldwide Web and

    11           particularly HTTP is that when a user makes a request for a

    12           file or a named item the Web server, that is, on the content

    13           provider's side does not necessarily have to have a file by

    14           that name.  What they can do is they can run a program, a CGI

    15           program, which will go out and compute a file of the type

    16           that the user has requested, this leads to a very powerful

    17           mechanism.

    18           Q   Do you also have expertise in secured protocols that

    19           would lend itself to issues involving third-party

    20           verification over the Internet?

    21           A   Yes.  One of the problems we had when we were downloading

    22           user interface software is that in essence you were

    23           downloading an executable program.  If you don't know who you

    24           downloaded it from then you could download it from a stranger

    25           who could then do damaging things to your system.  So, we

                                                                             8

     1           spent considerable time looking at existing technology for

     2           how to protect ourselves there.  We are currently finishing a

     3           Master's thesis that points out several holes in the formal

     4           technology and ways in which those things could be

     5           circumvented by individuals.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Did you -- I didn't hear, did you

     7           say that you are getting a Master's --

     8                    THE WITNESS:  No, I am supervising a Master's.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, you were supervising.  I didn't

    10           think -- I thought that was going backwards.  Your student is

    11           getting a Master's degree?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And you're supervising that thesis?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  And I am supervising that, yes.

    15           BY MR. BARON:  

    16           Q   You're the thesis advisor, as --

    17           A   That is correct.

    18           Q   Okay.  Mr. Ennis also brought up your knowledge of PICs;

    19           have you read the PICs technical specifications on labels and

    20           services found at the PICs Website?

    21           A   Yes.

    22           Q   Do you see anything, Dr. Olsen, in those specifications

    23           that represent anything other than normal, traditional

    24           computer science?

    25           A   No, I don't see anything in that regard.  A label under

                                                                             9

     1           the PICs standard is essentially a record, this is a standard

     2           concept in computing.  A -- sort of the threshold you would

     3           set in a browser are simply a very simplistic numeric

     4           mechanism for defining a class of records you want to

     5           receive, we teach this at sophomore-level computer science.

     6           Q   Dr. Olsen, do you believe you can form an expert opinion

     7           on how PICs technology can be utilized based on your study of

     8           the PICs materials?

     9           A   Yes.

    10           Q   Dr. Olsen, am I correct that your very own field of

    11           research has contributed to the development of PICs

    12           technology?

    13           A   Yes.  One of the issues that PICs faced was when they

    14           wanted to have lots of rating services, but the parents would

    15           only have, say, one browser, how are the parents with their

    16           one browser going to set the controls for several rating

    17           services.  PICs has a very nice solution where they

    18           distribute on the Web the information about what the controls

    19           are, then the browser can automatically configure the user

    20           interface to be able to set those controls.  There is a paper

    21           listed in my curriculum vitae on language-based

    22           specifications that actually pioneered that user-interface

    23           technique.

    24           Q   Dr. Olsen, the fifth and final area Mr. Ennis inquired

    25           about concerning your expertise was with respect to issues

                                                                            10

     1           involving libraries, do you recall that?

     2           A   Yes.

     3           Q   Have you ever studied the costs involved in creating an

     4           on-line digital library?

     5           A   Yes.  The Family History Library in Salt Lake has about

     6           20 million rolls of microfilm, currently the masters are

     7           locked in a mountain in Little Cottonwood Canyon, this makes

     8           them less accessible than people would like.  The people that

     9           run that library have been working with us for several years

    10           as to what it would take to bring those materials and bring

    11           them on-line.  And we did some cost studies of what it would

    12           take to scan them and what it would take to index them, we

    13           spent several years working with them on that issue.

    14           Q   Have you ever studied or done any work on electronic card

    15           catalogues?

    16           A   Yes.  Again, in our distributed user interfaces research

    17           we were very interested in providing interactive access to

    18           other repositories other than Websites.  So, we spent some

    19           time working with the people at the BYU library,

    20           understanding how the library electronically manages their

    21           card catalogue.  We looked very carefully at the Mark

    22           standard, which is the one that libraries use to communicate

    23           with each other, essentially that is a property list, which

    24           is a standard mechanism in computer science.  Yes, we did

    25           look at that.

                                                                            11

     1           Q   Have you ever done anything with naming methods for

     2           electronic library materials?

     3           A   Yes.  Again, with the Family History Library, they have

     4           the unique problem of wanting to link together genealogies of

     5           -- essentially their goal is the world, if they could

     6           accomplish it,  there are things about the way things are

     7           named in the Worldwide Web that make that difficult.  Once

     8           you have linked up a genealogy you would not like it to be

     9           broken.  So, we spent some time developing new naming

    10           technology for how to do that, so that once somebody decided

    11           a person was related to a particular other person that link

    12           would not easily be detached.  That approach is actually

    13           outlined in the papers we delivered to the plaintiffs.

    14           Q   One last question:  Have you ever written any software

    15           code that would enable the posting of library materials?

    16           A   Yes.  In the same project with the Family History

    17           Library, they have the largest ideological data base that's

    18           on-line in the world, they wanted to make -- so, they wanted

    19           to know if it was technically feasible to put that on the

    20           Worldwide Web.  I spent a couple of weeks, built the software

    21           and demonstrated that it was; it's not available because of

    22           copyright problems, but we demonstrated the technology.

    23           Q   Let's turn to the substantive topics on which Mr. Ennis

    24           and Mr. Hansen cross-examined you on Friday.  Dr. Olsen, you

    25           were asked a number of questions about your Minus L18

                                                                            12

     1           proposal, could you succinctly explain to the Court what the

     2           central points of that proposal represent?

     3           A   Most of the proposal is a response to some assertions by

     4           Mr. Bradner that it would be exceedingly difficult to -- for

     5           content providers to label their materials, most of the

     6           proposal is a counter-example.  It's a standard approach in

     7           computer science that when someone says it can't be done you

     8           disprove that by a counter-example, that's the purpose of the

     9           L18.  In essence the argument is that for content providers

    10           to label their materials is technologically quite

    11           straightforward.  On the other hand, for a third party or for

    12           parents to detect those materials without the assistance of

    13           the content provider is computationally quite difficult. 

    14           That really is the central issue of what I stated in the

    15           declaration.

    16           Q   You will recall that you were asked a number of questions

    17           about PICs, you recall those?

    18           A   Yes.

    19           Q   Would you please explain to the Court the ways in which

    20           your Minus L18 proposal is consistent with aspects of the

    21           PICs proposal?

    22           A   The PICs proposal specifically lays out something called

    23           self-labeling, I believe is what they termed it, whereby

    24           content providers can classify their materials.  Because the

    25           L18 proposal was meant as a counter-example I did not

                                                                            13

     1           extensively develop it in any way, it was only meant to show

     2           that it was possible.  It is trivial to take the L18 proposal

     3           and embed the same idea inside of PICs labeling.  PICs

     4           provides a more extensive way to describe the information,

     5           but relative to this law they are the same in that regard.

     6           Q   How does your L18 proposal go further than PICs in terms

     7           of enabling communications in a variety of applications over

     8           the Internet to be labeled?

     9           A   PICs is restricted to being able to label something that

    10           has a URL.  So, for example you could label a news group, you

    11           can label a file, you can label a site, et cetera.  L18 can

    12           do that also, they're pretty much the same in that regard. 

    13           There are many kinds of communication that do not have

    14           specifically a name, for example, an individual E-mail

    15           message does not have a name.  For that, in my declaration, I

    16           said you could take Minus L18 and put it in the subject line

    17           and thereby tag it, so even though it doesn't have a name a

    18           speaker could identify it.  The same thing with a news group. 

    19           A news item can have a name, that is possible; however, news

    20           items are so ephemeral, they live typically for a week or two

    21           weeks, most of them, some actually get preserved, but most of

    22           them, they appear and then some time later they disappear. 

    23           So that the task of actually rating individual news postings

    24           and naming them in PICs would be very difficult, if not

    25           impossible.

                                                                            14

     1           Q   There's nothing magical about your having picked Minus 

     2           L18, correct?

     3           A   No, any string of characters that didn't have an English

     4           meaning would work fine.

     5           Q   And nothing in your proposal does away with or eliminates

     6           the continued use of more sophisticated schemes like PICs,

     7           right?

     8           A   No, it was simply a counter-example, other things are

     9           possible and probably should be used.

    10           Q   What does the term content selection standard mean to

    11           you, Dr. Olsen?

    12           A   In my mind it was a mechanism or a way agreed upon within

    13           the community, let's say the Internet community, whereby

    14           people would identify particular kinds of content.

    15           Q   Is your Minus L18 proposal a type of content selection

    16           standard?

    17           A   Yes, it would -- if adopted by a large portion of the

    18           community it would be a standard for saying these things are

    19           inappropriate for people under 18.

    20           Q   Now, Mr. Ennis asked you a whole set of questions on

    21           whether cooperative technology presently exists which will

    22           pick up the Minus L18 tag, do you recall those questions?

    23           A   Yes.

    24           Q   How does Surfwatch and other parental-control technology

    25           already function to pick up such tags?

                                                                            15

     1           A   If, as Mr. Ennis pointed out on Friday, you used XXX it

     2           already picks it up.  If Surfwatch was to add the string

     3           Minus L18 to the data base they already distribute to their

     4           customers that would be picked up and it would be recognized,

     5           yes.

     6           Q   Tell the Court about your Netscape proxy server

     7           experiment and why it's relevant to the issue of available

     8           technology?

     9           A   That was a specific response to the fact that no software

    10           exists that could do blocking on a tag.  What we did is we

    11           took the Netscape proxy server, we specifically put in it the

    12           regular expression that would identify any URL with Minus

    13           L18, and then we checked to see if it was blocked, they were. 

    14           We then said can we block it and require a password, we did. 

    15           This took us about four hours of work, again, it was a

    16           counter-example.  It was asserted that this was hard or

    17           impossible, it was not.

    18           Q   Could you also tell the Court about your Eudora

    19           experiment?

    20           A   We were looking at the same issue related to mail

    21           programs.  Eudora is a client mail program, it's the one I

    22           happen to use that receives mail over the Internet.  In

    23           Eudora it has a filtering technique, as I have described.  I

    24           took ten minutes, put in the Minus L18 tag to see if it would

    25           filter, it did.  The minor difficulty with this particular

                                                                            16

     1           experiment is that, unlike the proxy server, what I did could

     2           be easily undone.  The point, however, being that if Eudora

     3           wanted to it would take them an hour to make that code so it

     4           couldn't be undone.  But the technology for checking is

     5           there, we tried it, it works.

     6           Q   Do you have any reason to believe that the folks at

     7           Netscape couldn't repeat your experiments and incorporate

     8           them into their existing software?

     9           A   It would be very easy for them to do.

    10           Q   The same question for Microsoft, do you have any reason

    11           to believe that Mr. Bill Gates couldn't basically do the same

    12           thing with respect to Microsoft software and browsers?

    13           A   I suspect Mr. Gates would have to ask one of his

    14           programmers to do it, but it could be done.

    15                    (Laughter.)

    16           Q   The same question with respect to America Online, Prodigy

    17           and Compuserve, could they do the same thing?

    18           A   I see nothing that is difficult about this technology,

    19           they could do it very easily.

    20           Q   Now, in response to Mr. Ennis' questions you talked about

    21           a notion of, quote, "statistical assurance," could you

    22           explain to the Court what you meant by statistical assurance?

    23           A   Statistical assurance has to do when you're dealing with

    24           not an absolute is it or is it not possible, but what is the

    25           probability of something.  I looked specifically at that

                                                                            17

     1           because my understanding of the law was that a hundred

     2           percent was not required under the law.  So, statistical

     3           assurance says to some extent that, for example, browsers

     4           which pick up L18 or browsers that pick up PICs have been

     5           deployed, if they have been deployed to, say, 90 percent of

     6           all client sites then you are 90 percent assured that if you

     7           have labeled in accordance with that that your material will

     8           not get through to minors, if they're deployed to 99 percent

     9           of the sites then you're 99 percent assured.

    10           Q   How high would your statistical assurance be if Netscape,

    11           Microsoft, America Online, Prodigy and Compuserve fixed their

    12           browsers and software to incorporate tags such as the L18

    13           tag?

    14           A   Microsoft -- excuse me, Netscape claims to have 80

    15           percent of this market.  Therefore, if all of their current

    16           customers updated, which they almost always do because new

    17           features are added that they want, then that would lead one

    18           to believe you have 80 percent coverage.  Assuming that

    19           Microsoft is reasonably effective at overcoming -- or

    20           grabbing off the remaining 20 percent or perhaps snatching

    21           away that 80 percent, then your coverage is increased to

    22           above 90 percent.

    23           Q   Now, how would a consensus standard or convention develop

    24           around a proposal like Minus L18?

    25           A   There are several ways that it could be done.  It could

                                                                            18

     1           be done very formally through the IETF; it could be done

     2           informally through news group communications, a lot of things

     3           are done that way; it could be done, as Mr. Vezza has

     4           testified, his W3C consortium is very interested in doing

     5           exactly this kind of thing, it could be done that way. 

     6           Someone like Netscape, who dominates a market, they have

     7           already shown their willingness and ability to set standards,

     8           they would simply say this is the standard we are using and,

     9           given their market dominance, that would quickly be adopted.

    10           Q   Do you think Mr. Bradner and his colleagues at the IETF

    11           have the technical expertise to sit down and design such a

    12           standard?

    13           A   Easily.

    14           Q   Would you even need a consensus on such a standard, that

    15           is, what I'm asking, could individuals who use Minus L18

    16           essentially contact Surfwatch and other companies like

    17           Netscape and Microsoft and say, here's my site and here's the

    18           label, please block the site using a key-word search for

    19           Minus L18?

    20           A   They could easily do that.

    21           Q   And how do the market forces surrounding the rollout of

    22           the PICs-compatible software influence the ability of

    23           browsers to pick a Minus L18 tag?

    24           A   Those market forces are similar to what would be required

    25           for Minus L18, the market forces that Mr. Vezza discussed.  I

                                                                            19

     1           think it's a very compelling case that the people who produce

     2           this software are very interested in providing parental

     3           controls.  They see an enormous home market, they see the

     4           extent that the public feels that these kind of materials are

     5           available to their children, that that market has diminished. 

     6           So, there is a very strong motivation on the part of the

     7           people who produce this software to sort of make the problem

     8           go away.  So, they have already bought on the PICs, which is

     9           far more complicated than what's required for L18, they may

    10           or may not adopt to L18 or they may just go ahead with PICs,

    11           as they have said, either way would accomplish the arguments

    12           I have presented.

    13           Q   Let's turn to third-party schemes; would you please

    14           explain to the Court, in your view, how do tagging schemes

    15           without the required cooperation of content creators 

    16           -- strike that.  In your view, do tagging schemes without the

    17           required cooperation of the content creators have less chance

    18           of assuring the screening of inappropriate material?

    19           A   The simple answer is yes, they do have less of a chance. 

    20           If I could clarify that a little, one approach for a label

    21           bureau, which is what's outlined in the PICs proposal, or

    22           someone like Surfwatch or Netnanny or one of the others, one

    23           of the approaches they can take is to say that we will go out

    24           and we will look at all of the Internet sites, and we will

    25           decide which ones need to be blocked and we will put this in

                                                                            20

     1           a data base.  Surfwatch takes that data base and distributes

     2           it to the individuals, PICs proposes that that data base be

     3           kept on some Website somewhere, so that the individual's

     4           computer is not encumbered with that.  Either way, what it

     5           means is it means that some entity has to, number one, find

     6           all of the Internet sites, which as Mr. Bradner has testified

     7           is difficult even to count them, let alone find them, they

     8           would have to find those sites, they would then have to look

     9           at the materials and then have to make a judgment.  They

    10           would also -- this is particularly problematic, because

    11           again, as Mr. Bradner testified, the number of sites in the

    12           Internet is doubling every nine months.  So, this means that

    13           for a label bureau to be successful they would have to do as

    14           much work in this nine months as they have ever done in the

    15           history of their company, that's a significant challenge and

    16           I'm not sure how they would ever accomplish that.  Now, that

    17           assumes that what you're going to do is you're going to find

    18           all of the sites that are a problem and that means that when

    19           you find such a site you are going to block the entire site. 

    20           Well, this is problematic and PICs tries to get around this,

    21           because there are certain nonprofit sites that may have very

    22           specific areas that are sexually-explicit and most of the

    23           site is not.  

    24                    You would have a problem with the Surfwatch

    25           approach, which is as I understand it sites only.  PICs

                                                                            21

     1           allows you, however, to label for a label bureau to tag a

     2           specific file or class of files.  Well, the problem with that

     3           is that now instead of having the problem of finding all of

     4           the sites we have to also now find and document all of the

     5           possible files on all of those possible sites, and files are

     6           growing at an even faster rate than the number of sites,

     7           because they're easier to create.  So, we essentially -- if

     8           we adopt a label bureau approach or a third-party approach we

     9           have set for them the task of taking an exponentially growing

    10           problem and trying to monitor that problem.  

    11                    What we have also set for them is that they must

    12           somehow get income for doing this, this is very expensive. 

    13           The current approach under Surfwatch, Netnanny and others is

    14           to sell a subscription to parents.  Well, if the work

    15           required to do this is exponentially growing we have a

    16           problem with where those costs might go in the long run.

    17           Q   Are there other problems with key-word searches

    18           associated with this kind of scheme?

    19           A   Yes.  Another one of the technologies that parental

    20           controls are using is to search for individual words.  The

    21           problem there is the words, unlike something like L18 or

    22           unlike a PICs label, which are specially designed to have

    23           computable meaning, key words have English meanings.  For

    24           example, if you search for the word sex and say I will not

    25           allow anything to go through that contains the word sex it is

                                                                            22

     1           possible that you might screen out sites that you would not

     2           consider offensive but did mention sex.  However, if you

     3           search for the word sex you would have problems where sex is

     4           embedded in a larger name.  For example, many of the

     5           directories I looked at had the name Hotsex, well, that's now

     6           a different word.  Well, we would either collect all of the

     7           ways people would assemble adjectives and smash them

     8           together, computer scientists regularly eliminate spaces and

     9           periods and vowels and other stuff.  So, we could say, okay,

    10           well, what I'm going to do then is I'm going to search for

    11           the three characters s-e-x.  Well, that's a possibility too,

    12           but now anything related to Essex County is caught and

    13           screened and the child cannot look up Essex County, they

    14           could not look up Middlesex County.  So, what we have done is

    15           by using English terms we have been very imprecise about what

    16           we want to screen.  Another example is one might want to put

    17           playboy in as something I want to screen for, I don't want

    18           that to go to children.  People who are fighting against such

    19           restrictions might say, well, I will go to playmate.  Well,

    20           if I go to playmate I could very easily then screen out a

    21           chat room for kids, because it has a different meaning among

    22           children than it does among people interested in sexually-

    23           explicit material.  So, the more words I add to the list, the

    24           more things that are appropriate for kids that will be

    25           screened out; the less words I add to the list, then the more

                                                                            23

     1           things that I want screened out will come through.  The

     2           problem is as you're trying to use English in a precise form,

     3           for a precise purpose, all of the library people and the

     4           information retrieval people have recognized this problem and

     5           where possible they always recommend assigning a tag or a

     6           classification, like the Library of Congress classification,

     7           so that they can get around this imprecise-meaning-of-English

     8           problem.

     9           Q   Now, you were in the courtroom Friday when Mr. Vezza

    10           described business models for third-party rating schemes

    11           developing, correct?

    12           A   Yes.

    13           Q   Do you see specific problems arising with third-party

    14           rating services such as Disney or the Boy Scouts actually

    15           entering into contracts with sites that wish to label

    16           content?

    17           A   As I remember the interchange in that testimony it was 

    18           -- Mr. Vezza was asked how would you get around this problem

    19           I have described of how do I track all of these sites and how

    20           does a third party do all of this labeling.  The business

    21           model he proposed that would solve that was that labeling

    22           bureaus would enter into contracts with the content providers

    23           and, based on the force of the content -- contract, the

    24           content providers would do the labeling.  The problem is is

    25           that -- there are two problems:  If for example Disney is the

                                                                            24

     1           labeling bureau I see no reason why the purveyors of serious

     2           pornography want to enter into a contract with Disney,

     3           they're not interested in what Disney thinks of them.  There

     4           is also a problem with why would Disney want to make the news

     5           by having contracted with some pornographer to do the ratings

     6           for them, they want to stake their reputation on the fact

     7           that they're doing the ratings themselves.  

     8                    So, I agree with Mr. Vezza to the extent that if we

     9           can provide some legal force by means of a contract or by

    10           means of a law that the content providers can do an excellent

    11           job of labeling the stuff, but I see a lot of people who

    12           would not voluntarily enter into such a contract.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But haven't you said repeatedly, as

    14           Mr. Vezza said, that the market forces -- I said and he

    15           agreed with me that the market forces were enormous to solve

    16           the problem that brought about this law, for example, and

    17           that brings us together, and you agree with that point, don't

    18           you?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I do agree with that point.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because huge parts of the market are

    21           not even getting onto the Net precisely because of the

    22           existence of the material that are in these binders.

    23                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct, but those market

    24           forces are brought to bear on the people who create browser

    25           software, those market forces that we talked about are not

                                                                            25

     1           brought to bear on the people who produce the content.  The

     2           people who produce the content have no motivation whatsoever

     3           to cooperate.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, sure, that's true.  And wouldn't

     5           you agree with the fact that we've heard testimony, I don't

     6           think it's in dispute, that about 40 percent of the sexually-

     7           explicit material is created offshore?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  I couldn't characterize, I haven't

     9           looked, frankly.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, assume that's true.

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  If 40 percent is controlled offshore

    13           or created offshore how in the world is anything that's going

    14           to happen in the United States going to affect that?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  To the extent of them providing

    16           leadership of how it can be controlled for those countries

    17           who are interested in controlling, it would help.  To the

    18           extent of forcing a country who is not interested, I don't

    19           see how it has effect, but I didn't consider that because I

    20           didn't know that the CDA would apply to offshore.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, that would be an interesting

    22           subject by itself.  I'm sorry to interrupt you.

    23           BY MR. BARON:  

    24           Q   Well, let me just pick up on Judge Dalzell's question. 

    25           If U. S. sites were tagged -- if U. S. sites tagged their

                                                                            26

     1           speech using a Minus L18 approach, as you suggested, would it

     2           be easier or more difficult for the Surfwatches and other

     3           blocking software to search for foreign sites to block?  

     4           A   Okay, if for example the CDA were upheld and people used

     5           tagging or some other mechanism to take care of that, that

     6           means now that the other 60 percent, using your 40 percent

     7           figure, the other 60 percent is now no longer of interest to

     8           Surfwatch and Netnanny and they can now concentrate on the 40

     9           percent, which is a smaller problem.

    10           Q   And based on your knowledge and experience of the

    11           Internet do you believe that the U. S. sets a leadership role

    12           on standard setting that would influence the behavior of

    13           foreign speech providers on the Net?

    14           A   In a technical sense, yes, most of the standards that

    15           exist on the Internet were begun in the U. S.  Some of them,

    16           for example the Worldwide Web, began elsewhere, but generally

    17           the U. S. has a leadership role technically.

    18           Q   We now turn to Mr. Hansen's questions to you Friday.  Do

    19           you recall being asked hypotheticals about one or more

    20           nonprofit groups having the problem of having to rate 14,000

    21           pages or files on their Website?

    22           A   Yes.

    23           Q   Mr. Hansen used EFF, the Electronic Frontier Foundation,

    24           as an example, do you recall that?

    25           A   Yes, I do.

                                                                            27

     1           Q   Do you know if EFF rates their site with PICs?

     2           A   Not to my knowledge.

     3           Q   If a parent was blocking any site that was not rated

     4           under the PICs methodology would children be able to reach

     5           the EFF?

     6           A   No.

     7           Q   Assuming that a tag or label -- that browsers detecting

     8           tags or labels were widely available, could the EFF tag their

     9           entire site as not for minors?

    10           A   Sure.

    11           Q   Minors would still not receive any of the EFF speech

    12           whether parents blocked all unrated sites or EFF tagged them

    13           -- tagged their entire site as inappropriate for minors,

    14           correct?

    15           A   Either way minors would not receive it.

    16           Q   If the EFF tagged their whole site would children still

    17           have access to the entire remainder of the Internet?

    18           A   Yes, they would.

    19           Q   If EFF tagged their whole site and the parents left their

    20           browser open to all sites not rated as inappropriate would

    21           the child have access to more of the Internet?

    22           A   Yes, they would.

    23           Q   You also discussed some transition costs on Friday; how

    24           would you go about identifying text materials that are

    25           sexually-explicit under a very short time frame as Mr. Hansen

                                                                            28

     1           proposed?

     2           A   Yes, Mr. Hansen I believe posed a very specific case of a

     3           very short transition time.  In terms of the six fifteen

     4           transition time, nothing can be done in software by six

     5           fifteen.  If we impose a more reasonable transition time of a

     6           month or two, you have to consider textual materials and you

     7           have to consider images, I guess the first one I'd look up is

     8           textual materials.

     9           Q   I asked you about textual materials.

    10           A   I'm sorry, textual materials.  If I had the

    11           responsibility the first task I would take is mark the entire

    12           site as not accessible to minors as a temporary measure, this

    13           doesn't prohibit adults looking at it or anything else.  The

    14           next step would be to identify some words that I would like

    15           to search for.  In this case I can adopt quite a broad

    16           screen, because what I'm really hunting for in this first

    17           step is to find out of all of my materials those materials

    18           that I know I can turn loose to kids and it won't be a

    19           problem.  

    20                    So, one approach would be to pick a collection of

    21           words that we think are sexually-explicit or otherwise

    22           inappropriate, I would go to the thesaurus and expand that

    23           collection with all of their synonyms that I could find.  If

    24           I was feeling really conservative I could expand it again,

    25           but let's assume I didn't.  I now have a set of search words. 

                                                                            29

     1           Most large sites of that size already have a whole-word

     2           index, but let's assume they didn't, because if they do have

     3           a whole-word index then finding all of the documents that

     4           contain those words is very easy, but assuming they don't one

     5           could write a Purl (ph.) script that could run overnight and

     6           examine all of their documents and flag them.  Now what I

     7           would do is I would take all of the ones that weren't found

     8           that way and un-tag them, these are inappropriate for minors. 

     9           So, in a matter of less than a week I've now taken most of my

    10           site and re-exposed it to minors.  Now I have a few files

    11           left and those files someone would have to manually look at

    12           and make a determination.  At no point have any of these been

    13           denied to adults.

    14           Q   And how would you go about identifying sexually-explicit

    15           images?

    16           A   Images are another challenge, because sort of the key-

    17           word search technique doesn't help here, I don't know of a

    18           technique that will identify them.  After Mr. Hansen's

    19           questions I sat down with my calculator and made the

    20           following assumption:  Assuming all 1400 are images, which

    21           they are not, but assuming they were --

    22           Q   I believe Mr. Hansen said 14,000.

    23           A   14,000, excuse me.  Assuming all 14,000 are images and

    24           assuming I could hire someone or take someone on my staff and

    25           say I want you to look at each one of these, all I want to

                                                                            30

     1           know is is there a sexual organ or act or an excretory organ

     2           or act in this picture, that's all I want to know, in which

     3           case, assuming I gave this person a full 15 seconds to make

     4           this determination, and that's a long time to look at a

     5           picture and say is there a sexual act or organ here, then it

     6           would take such a person about two weeks to have made this

     7           judgment on every single -- all 14,000 images.  Now, my

     8           projection would be that most of those images are not.  I

     9           mean, certain sites this would not be true, but those sites

    10           already know that they have this problem.  So, most of those

    11           images would be not, in two weeks I have taken the vast

    12           majority of my images and said there is no problem here, and

    13           I have opened them up to minors.  Now I take the last group

    14           and I say how badly do I want to tell minors or show minors

    15           these pictures.  Well, if I think really badly then I might

    16           have to make a more careful analysis and I probably have to

    17           involve my lawyers, but we very quickly screen, taking the

    18           vast majority of our material, and made it available to

    19           minors in a couple of weeks.

    20           Q   And what about ongoing costs in terms of looking at text

    21           and images?

    22           A   Okay, this is a matter of the judgment calls being made

    23           at the time the material is produced.  In the case of text

    24           materials, if a site was particularly concerned about their

    25           text materials they could very easily put a piece of software

                                                                            31

     1           in place that would periodically check for all new pages and

     2           check to see if they had any of the words that we ought to

     3           look at, that's one way.  Again, what I'm looking at here is

     4           not a precise screen, but a screen by which manual

     5           intervention can be required.  What we're trying to do is

     6           take the vast majority of the stuff and simply not look, we

     7           know it doesn't have a problem.  So, your initial screen

     8           simply tells you that small amount of material that you

     9           actually need someone to look at and make a human judgment.  

    10                    In the case of my images, again, if I simply publish

    11           to the staff, if it contains a sexual or excretory organ or

    12           act please let us know, so we can check it before you

    13           actually put it up or mark it as not available to minors,

    14           take the conservative approach, in which case we may not

    15           care.

    16           Q   Mr. Hansen asked you about Adultcheck and your knowledge

    17           of whether third-party registration services such as

    18           Adultcheck cater to pornographic sites, do you recall that?

    19           A   Yes.

    20           Q   In your opinion, Dr. Olsen, is there any technical

    21           problem with other types of third-party registration services

    22           catering to non-pornographic sites arising on the Internet?

    23           A   Yes.  If Mr. Hansen's clients didn't like that particular

    24           neighborhood they could form their own version of Adultcheck

    25           and have a nicer neighborhood.

                                                                            32

     1           Q   Your testimony is that there is not a technical problem?

     2           A   There is not a technical problem, they could do exactly

     3           what Adultcheck did.

     4           Q   Just on a stray topic here, the Court inquired how many

     5           teenagers you knew who could reinstall an operating system,

     6           do you recall that question?

     7           A   Yes, I do.

     8           Q   You said you knew four or five kids in every high school

     9           that could do that and you characterized this number as a,

    10           quote, "small majority," do you remember that testimony?

    11           A   Yes.

    12           Q   Did you mean small minority?

    13           A   Yes, I did.  I'm sorry.

    14           Q   Your proposals are not limited to just Minus L18,

    15           correct?

    16           A   That is correct.

    17           Q   Your declaration sets out a number of options, right?

    18           A   That is correct.  One of the things I intended to do in

    19           the declaration is provide a broad menu of possibilities.

    20           Q   And you have not ruled out using registrations of URLs

    21           with specific directories as one way to reduce the

    22           availability of sexually-explicit speech to minors on the

    23           Net, correct?

    24           A   Yes, if there was some directory or Surfwatch or Netnanny

    25           I could very easily notify them and save them the labor of

                                                                            33

     1           having to search my material, and that would create a barrier

     2           to minors, yes.

     3           Q   Now, you've been working on these problems just for the

     4           past few weeks, correct, Dr. Olsen?

     5           A   That is correct.

     6           Q   In your view, is there sufficient creativity in the

     7           Internet community to come up with a variety of other

     8           solutions to the issues of screening based on available

     9           technology?

    10           A   To the extent that I took a couple of weeks, generated

    11           several technically-feasible solutions, there are a lot of

    12           people who have done a lot of work on the Internet, I have

    13           every reason to believe that they could generate many more

    14           than I have thought about.

    15           Q   In your view, Dr. Olsen, are the technical issues

    16           involving and insuring compliance with the CDA as difficult

    17           to solve as other issues facing on the Internet, like

    18           electronic commerce security issues?

    19           A   No, no.  We're not talking about an issue here of

    20           entering into a contractual agreement to pay for a service,

    21           which is one of the things people really want to do on the

    22           Internet, we're not even talking about the difficulties of

    23           actually getting all of the Internet to talk to each other,

    24           that was a far more difficult problem.  If we have the

    25           cooperation of the content providers in labeling their

                                                                            34

     1           materials, this is a trivial task, without their cooperation

     2           it's a very difficult task.

     3           Q   One last question, Dr. Olsen:  Do you believe that the

     4           use of the Minus L18 tagging scheme you propose would have

     5           any adverse effect on the growth or use of the Internet?

     6           A   No.  For the people who are not producing sexually-

     7           explicit materials, which constitute most of the content

     8           providers, they frankly don't care, and they would not be

     9           involved and they would not have any obligation of any kind

    10           and could happily go their way.

    11           Q   Your proposals would not have an adverse effect on the

    12           Net as a whole?

    13           A   Absolutely not.

    14                    MR. BARON:  I have no more questions, your Honor.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Recross?

    17                    (Pause.)

    18                    MR. ENNIS:  Bruce Ennis, your Honors, for the ALA

    19           plaintiffs.

    20                                RECROSS-EXAMINATION

    21           BY MR. ENNIS:  

    22           Q   Dr. Olsen, you began by saying that it is simple for a

    23           speaker to add a four-character string to speech for which

    24           such a tag is appropriate, correct?

    25           A   That is correct.

                                                                            35

     1           Q   But the speaker will add such a string after the judgment

     2           has been made that that string is appropriate for that

     3           particular speech?

     4           A   They could do that or they could add it conservatively if

     5           they thought there was a doubt and defer making that speech

     6           available to minors to some later time when a determination

     7           had been made.

     8           Q   But, in any event, before the simple act of typing in

     9           those four characters there's going to have to be a human

    10           judgment about whether typing in those four characters is

    11           appropriate, correct?

    12           A   At any time you want to block material from minors

    13           somebody will have to make a human judgment, that is correct.

    14           Q   Is it correct that someone has to make a human judgment

    15           to block material from minors if you're using the PICs system

    16           and the PICs browser is set to reject all speech that's not

    17           tagged or labeled, then you don't require a human judgment,

    18           do you?

    19           A   Other than the judgment to lock up most of the Internet

    20           and put the kids in a ghetto of their own.

    21           Q   Well, that's a parental judgment?

    22           A   Other than that judgment your content providers would not

    23           have to do anything.

    24           Q   But with respect to any system that does require the

    25           speech to be tagged or labeled, your proposal, that kind of

                                                                            36

     1           system would require human judgment as to what to tag?

     2           A   That is correct.

     3           Q   And I assume you agree that there is no -- I think you

     4           just testified there is no technology that can make that

     5           judgment with respect to images?

     6           A   That's correct.

     7           Q   That's not possible to automate, a human being is going

     8           to have to look at the image and decide whether the image is

     9           appropriate or inappropriate for minors?

    10           A   That is correct with a minor caveat.  It is conceivable

    11           that image processing technology could improve to do that,

    12           but using today's technology it is impossible.

    13           Q   All my questions are assuming using today's technology,

    14           today that is not possible?

    15           A   That is not possible.

    16           Q   And in fact even with respect to words there can be

    17           patently-offensive descriptions that don't use one of the

    18           seven dirty words, correct?

    19           A   Absolutely, that's I believe stated in my declaration.

    20           Q   So, it's not enough just to search for key words that

    21           would in some way be themselves dirty or offensive for

    22           minors, correct?

    23           A   Correct.

    24           Q   There could be a combination of otherwise inoffensive

    25           words which in combination produces a patently-offensive

                                                                            37

     1           depiction, correct?

     2           A   Correct.  What I have just described to you in the

     3           testimony earlier has to do with how you could use technology

     4           to make a pre-screen, this is based on the assumption that

     5           the content provider is completely ignorant of what the

     6           materials are that are being posted, most content providers

     7           are not that ignorant.

     8           Q   Well, you're making a distinction between the content

     9           creator and the content provider in assuming that the content

    10           provider is also the content creator?

    11           A   I haven't made a clear distinction, I'm more interested

    12           in the creator than the actual provider.

    13           Q   Well, let's make a clear distinction.  Let's suppose

    14           you're a library and you're putting 2,500 magazines on-line,

    15           every time the new issue comes out it goes on-line, you're

    16           not creating that content, you're not the editor, you didn't

    17           write it, you didn't look at it, you just put it on-line,

    18           right?  Now --

    19           A   That's correct.

    20           Q   -- there's a difference there, the library is not going

    21           to know in advance the content of all those 2,500 magazines?

    22           A   That depends, that depends on what they expect of whoever

    23           provided the content to them.

    24           Q   Well, let's suppose Vanity Fair, which is one of the

    25           magazines the declarations indicate is on-line today, is the

                                                                            38

     1           library going to know in advance the content of each issue of

     2           Vanity Fair?

     3           A   No, but the library may enter into an agreement or

     4           libraries in general could enter into agreement to ask

     5           magazines to identify the materials.

     6           Q   All right.  Suppose a magazine --

     7           A   They could, for example, this is what libraries already

     8           do with most books, most books come with a Library of

     9           Congress categorization.

    10           Q   Then someone at the library is going to have to be

    11           responsible for getting that information from Vanity Fair and

    12           all of the other 2,500 magazines --

    13           A   Or somebody at Vanity Fair.

    14           Q   Well, somebody at the library has to receive it and then

    15           make a human judgment about how to tag or label that before

    16           putting it on line, correct?

    17           A   This presumes Vanity Fair did not make the judgment

    18           beforehand, yes.

    19           Q   Well, Vanity Fair doesn't make the judgment, Vanity Fair

    20           says, I'm going to have a cover image of Demi Moore and she's

    21           partially nude, somebody at the library has to make a

    22           judgment about whether that's offensive or not, correct?

    23           A   The library would either make that judgment or they would

    24           make the judgment that we're just not interested in

    25           distributing Vanity Fair to minors --

                                                                            39

     1           Q   All right.

     2           A   -- and tag it anyway.

     3           Q   Now, let's suppose the library runs a key-word search and

     4           suppose all of these magazines have the data base and

     5           technology and it's there, which I think is a big assumption,

     6           assume that's so and you find that somewhere in these -- each

     7           of these 2500 magazines there is one word or two words or

     8           three words that might be considered offensive, does the

     9           librarian then have to go to the magazine and look at those

    10           words in context, see how many of them there are?

    11           A   You're asking me to make a judgment as to how the library

    12           would decide whether or not they had met the CDA, I'm not

    13           prepared to make that evaluation.

    14           Q   Well, suppose each of the 2500 magazines has one of the

    15           dirty words in it, the seven dirty words, you just

    16           automatically classify them all as inappropriate for minors

    17           or do you make a human judgment?

    18           A   You could classify the particular issue or the particular

    19           article.

    20           Q   Which way would you classify it, inappropriate for

    21           minors?

    22           A   Inappropriate for minors, that's a possibility, but

    23           that's a judgment, what you're asking for is do I know how

    24           libraries would go about classifying materials and the answer

    25           is, no, I don't.

                                                                            40

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  In other words, if in one issue -- I

     2           want to get this right -- if let's say The Economist is on-

     3           line and if in one issue the word fuck appears that under

     4           your proposal the whole issue would be blocked?

     5                    THE WITNESS:  Not necessarily, not necessarily, it

     6           depends on --

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, wouldn't the library have to

     8           do exactly what Mr. Ennis just said, it would have to go

     9           through all of the content and tag -- I realize your system

    10           would allow you to tag the word fuck so that it wouldn't be

    11           accessed, but the Carnegie Library would have to do that if

    12           The Economist didn't.  And the reason I give The Economist is

    13           because it's based in the United Kingdom.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  Somebody would have to -- to have to

    15           make this screen.  As far as -- I would like to oppose a

    16           little bit the characterization that the entire issue would

    17           have to be screened or even the entire magazine would have to

    18           be labeled.  The granularity is quite flexible as to how

    19           deeply you wanted to actually do your labeling, but you are

    20           correct, somebody would have to make this judgment.

    21           BY MR. ENNIS:  

    22           Q   Is it quite flexible if you, the librarian, risk going to

    23           jail for two years if you make the wrong judgment and you put

    24           on-line material that is found to be patently offensive for a

    25           minor?

                                                                            41

     1           A   Going to jail is a legal opinion.

     2                    MR. BARON:  Objection.  This line of questioning

     3           presumes that this witness is answering legal conclusions,

     4           he's a lawyer, he knows what the CDA's legal import is, none

     5           of that is true, he's just a technical expert.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, his testimony went pretty far

     7           in terms of the implications of his proposal, so I think that

     8           we ought to let them cross-examine him.

     9           BY MR. ENNIS:  

    10           Q   Dr. Olsen, I believe you testified that your proposal

    11           would require the cooperation of entities other than the

    12           speaker and that without that cooperation it would be a very

    13           difficult task to protect minors from inappropriate material,

    14           correct?

    15           A   If there isn't some filter at some place along the

    16           communication chain the tag alone is not sufficient, that is

    17           correct.

    18           Q   And you mentioned that the entities that might have to

    19           cooperate would include the people who create browsers, such

    20           as the Netscape Navigator, correct?

    21           A   That is correct.

    22           Q   And the on-line service providers, correct?

    23           A   On-line -- not necessarily.  To the extent that the on-

    24           line service provider provides the browser --

    25           Q   All right.

                                                                            42

     1           A   -- but -- or the on-line service provider, I believe in

     2           my declaration there's the discussion of the provider could

     3           if they wanted do this by means of a proxy server.

     4           Q   Or even the end-user blocking software, like Surfwatch,

     5           Cyberpatrol, Netnanny --

     6           A   Absolutely.

     7           Q   -- they could change their software to recognize your L18

     8           tag, correct?

     9           A   Or the PICs tags.

    10           Q   Or PICs, all right.  But the central point is your

    11           tagging proposal does require the cooperation of entities

    12           down the communication pipeline?

    13           A   It is effective to the extent that down the pipeline

    14           screens have been deployed, that is correct.

    15           Q   Do you know whether the Communications Decency Act

    16           requires any cooperation or any such effort by any entity

    17           down the communication pipeline?

    18           A   I am not aware of any such requirement.

    19           Q   Have you read the Act?

    20           A   I have read the pieces you showed me.

    21           Q   And that's all?

    22           A   I believe I read a couple of other pieces that Mr. Baron

    23           showed me.

    24           Q   Did you read the conference report?

    25           A   No.

                                                                            43

     1           Q   Are you aware that Congress made a considered decision to

     2           impose no requirements on entities down the communications

     3           chain whatsoever?

     4           A   That is my understanding.

     5           Q   So, your proposal would be directly contrary to the

     6           policy choice Congress has already made?

     7           A   That's not what I said.  What I said is that market

     8           forces, which we have already had testimony on and which I

     9           believe in, would provide the impetus and the legal impetus

    10           in my mind is not required, but I do not know of a legal

    11           impetus for that cooperation, no.

    12           Q   All right.  Now, you testified that if all of these

    13           entities down the line did cooperate, say, voluntarily that

    14           you might then have a perhaps 90 percent statistical feeling

    15           of security that if you're the speaker and patently-offensive

    16           material would not reach minors, correct?

    17           A   Correct.

    18           Q   Of course that means patently-offensive material would be

    19           reaching ten percent of the people it shouldn't reach?

    20           A   Possibly.

    21           Q   And if you are at risk of criminal prosecution if your

    22           material reaches ten percent of the population that might be

    23           a concern for you?

    24           A   You're asking me I believe for a legal judgment as to

    25           what effective means and I can't make that --

                                                                            44

     1           Q   Well, suppose you're the speaker, would you consider that

     2           to be effective enough that you would feel comfortable in

     3           putting your speech on-line?

     4           A   If I was a speaker I would consult my lawyer as to

     5           whether or not I was meeting the CDA.

     6           Q   Now, your 90 percent statistical significance figure

     7           assumes, does it not, that all of the speech has been

     8           properly tagged and labeled according to your proposal?

     9           A   Correct.

    10           Q   And that assumes that all of the speech that originates

    11           abroad by foreign speakers has been tagged and properly

    12           tagged?

    13           A   I think I have stated previously that we have not done

    14           anything relative to foreign speakers and we would have to

    15           rely upon Surfwatch or Netnanny technology for foreign

    16           speakers.

    17           Q   Well, then if we assume that some of the speakers are

    18           foreign speakers and they're not tagging at all would your 90

    19           percent go down considerably?

    20           A   The 90 percent -- I think you're fallacious here.  The 90

    21           percent is if I am a U. S. speaker how much can I depend will

    22           actually get through to minors, that doesn't say anything

    23           about how much minors -- how much potential sexually-explicit

    24           material has come to a minor, that's a different question.

    25           Q   I understand that, I'm asking you a different question. 

                                                                            45

     1           I'm asking you to assume all of the communication entities

     2           downline change their browsers, change their end-user

     3           software, change everything so that your L18 proposal could

     4           technologically be implemented, if no foreign speaker tags or

     5           labels their speech will that speech be kept away from 90

     6           percent of minors in America?

     7           A   That speech, no, but I didn't remember that there's

     8           anything in the CDA that involved those speakers.

     9           Q   Now, let's just talk about domestic speakers for a

    10           minute.  Your proposal assumes that domestic speakers, all

    11           domestic speakers will tag, correct?

    12           A   Mm-hmm.

    13           Q   And that they will tag responsibly?

    14           A   Mm-hmm.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Was that a yes?  I'm sorry.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I'm sorry.

    17           BY MR. ENNIS:  

    18           Q   I assume it's of course possible that there are some

    19           speakers out there who will willfully violate the law and not

    20           tag or tag inappropriately, correct?

    21           A   That's a good presumption.

    22           Q   And I assume there are a larger number of speakers out

    23           there who will tag, but they will not exactly know what's

    24           patently offensive or not and will make the wrong judgment

    25           and say my speech is appropriate for minors when later it's

                                                                            46

     1           turned out some community thinks it's inappropriate, that's

     2           possible too?

     3           A   That's possible.

     4           Q   All of that speech, whether willful violations of the Act

     5           or inadvertent violations of the Act, that will reach minors

     6           in America, correct?

     7           A   So will slander and fraud, yes, it's the same thing.

     8           Q   But it would not, would it, if you were using the PICs

     9           technology set to the default to tag -- to reject all un-

    10           tagged speech and to reject all tagged speech that has not

    11           been approved by a third-party rater, none of that would

    12           reach minors in America?

    13           A   That is correct.

    14           Q   Even foreign postings?

    15           A   That is correct.

    16           Q   You indicated you doubted that Disney would be willing or

    17           happy to label pornographic sites as pornographic?

    18           A   That's not what I said.

    19           Q   Well, perhaps I misunderstood you.  You don't doubt, do

    20           you, that there are several, plenty of groups in America

    21           today who would be happy to rate pornographic sites as

    22           pornographic?

    23           A   Yes, I believe that to be true.  What I did say, to

    24           clarify though, was I doubt that many of them would

    25           necessarily want to enter into contracts whereby purveyors of

                                                                            47

     1           pornographic material would do the rating in their behalf,

     2           that was my testimony.

     3           Q   And I believe you concluded your redirect testimony by

     4           saying that the ACLU or other speakers who wanted to set up

     5           their own verification systems could set up their own

     6           neighborhoods, their own systems, they could set up their own

     7           Website, correct, do that?

     8           A   Yes.

     9           Q   And is it fair to say that creating a Website costs

    10           anywhere between $1500 and $10,000, depending on how

    11           elaborate you want to be or need to be?

    12           A   That is fair.

    13           Q   And is it fair to say that maintaining, operating a

    14           Website costs anywhere from $20 a month to thousands of

    15           dollars a month, depending on how much traffic you have and

    16           what you want to do?

    17           A   That's fair.

    18           Q   And is it fair to say that if the ACLU or one of these

    19           groups wanted to set up their own Website to do this

    20           verification they would also need software to be involved in

    21           the verification process?

    22           A   That is correct.

    23           Q   And that would cost something too?

    24           A   That is correct.

    25           Q   And that also needs people who would be involved in

                                                                            48

     1           managing the actual act of verification?

     2           A   They would have to have people involved in managing the

     3           software, I believe that there is evidence that they could

     4           automate the act of verification.

     5           Q   Now, suppose you are not the ACLU, you're an individual

     6           speaker and you simply want to go home some night and you're

     7           disturbed by some event, and you want to go on-line and say

     8           something which you think is appropriate for adults, but

     9           might be patently offensive for minors, it's not practical or

    10           realistic to think you can on the spot go out and set up your

    11           own Website and all of this mechanism to screen access, is

    12           it?

    13           A   Nobody goes out and sets up their own Website -- or I

    14           should say nobody but very few of the people, the speakers

    15           we're talking about.  They almost all of them, the vast

    16           majority have some service where they go to.  I presume that

    17           such a person, if the ACLU were to set up such services, they

    18           could go to the ACLU as a place to put their speech.  So,

    19           nobody actually sets up their own Website with the exception

    20           of universities and such entities.

    21                    MR. ENNIS:  No further questions.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Mr. Hansen?

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Hansen?

    25                    MR. HANSEN:  I have no other cross.

                                                                            49

     1                    (Pause.)

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We'll take ten minutes before the

     3           Court...

     4                    (Court in recess; 10:35 to 10:50 o'clock a.m.)

     5                    THE COURT CLERK:  Court is now in session.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  Given the complexity of

     7           this case and its quick wind-down and all of the technical

     8           matters that we have to absorb and the different views of the

     9           different witnesses, we needed a few minutes, although I'm

    10           not sure I wouldn't have liked the weekend.

    11                    (Laughter.)

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Judge Buckwalter will begin.

    13                    Thank you, Mr. Olsen.

    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Mr. Olsen, if the creator of the

    15           material doesn't buy into your system, I think you testified

    16           it really creates a big problem.  Maybe they weren't your

    17           words, but if the creator of the material doesn't buy into

    18           your system, what did you say, it would make it very

    19           difficult to --

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Oh, yes.  It's not so much a matter of

    21           buying into my system but buying into the notion of if the

    22           creator doesn't make an effort to electronically identify --

    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay, that's what I meant.

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Then what happens is for parents to

    25           protect their children, they have to hire somebody like
                                                                            50

     1           Surfwatch to go and hunt down all of this material on their

     2           behalf and that's a problem because of the explosive growth

     3           of the material.

     4                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Does it follow from that that

     5           therefore the PIC system as proposed by the plaintiffs makes

     6           more sense?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  No.  

     8                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Why not?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  In the PIC system there are -- there

    10           are multiple ways that the PIC system has been proposed,

    11           there are multiple techniques in their proposal.  The self-

    12           labeling technique in their proposal is for the purpose of

    13           this case the same as what I've described.  It's a different

    14           way of tagging but it still relies upon the content provided

    15           to do the tagging.  So to that extent we are -- we are on the

    16           same wavelength there.

    17                    To the extent that they rely upon a label bureau,

    18           that means the label bureau must look at all the sites, look

    19           at all the documents, must hunt down all of the material that

    20           might be offensive and that is a challenge.  It's actually a

    21           greater challenge than the judgment required if a content

    22           provider just simply said this is the nature of my speech.

    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  You also stated that -- that this

    24           service and news groups and chat rooms, that there is no

    25           technology for the speaker to ensure that only adults are
                                                                            51

     1           listening.  I think you said you know of no possible way,

     2           only statistically or something to that effect.  I'm sure

     3           I've butchered up what you said, but what did you mean by

     4           that?  If you could --

     5                    THE WITNESS:  What I meant is that if the speaker in

     6           any of those forums --     

     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Right.

     8                    THE WITNESS:  -- were to label L18 PICs, whatever,

     9           PICs is a little hard in some of those forums, but if they

    10           were to label them then to the extent that browsers were

    11           screening, let's say, 80, 90 percent, then they have a 90

    12           percent assurity that it isn't reaching minors.

    13                    That's the statistical, you know, how much can I

    14           depend on.  To believe that 100 percent of all browsers are

    15           screening is naive, but if we presume the marketing claims of

    16           Netscape and Microsoft to presume that in short order 90

    17           percent are screening is a reasonable assumption.

    18                    I shouldn't, if I could clarify that, not are

    19           screening but could screen.  Nobody is screening today, with

    20           the exception of Netscape, Surfwatch, Net Nanny, et cetera. 

    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  And all your declarations dealing

    22           with determining which applicants are really adults have

    23           nothing to do with the feasibility of that from an economic

    24           standpoint, only that it's possible to in some way verify

    25           that?
                                                                            52

     1                    THE WITNESS:  I only addressed is it technically

     2           possible and is it technically difficult.  Those issues I did

     3           address.  As to what the exact costs are, I suppose I could

     4           find out but I'm not prepared to testify today.

     5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, that's all right.  It's

     6           technically possible, is it technically difficult?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  For which one?

     8                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  For that adult verification, to

     9           very whether or not the person is an adult?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Uhm --

    11                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  By that I mean the user.

    12                    THE WITNESS:  I guess -- I guess an easier thing to

    13           do is sort of describe in layman's terms what the technology

    14           is.  What would have to happen there, there are two ways that

    15           that could occur.  Let's presume the first way in which the

    16           person or the organization is providing the Webserver decides

    17           to take this responsibility.

    18                    The technology would be when a person first came to

    19           this site and the owner of the site doesn't know who they

    20           are, the owner of the site could request a credit card, use

    21           something like IC verified to make a charge on that card,

    22           determine that it is a valid card, and then could issue them

    23           a password.  And there's lots of stuff in the declaration

    24           about how user databases and passwords or no user end

    25           database could be used.
                                                                            53

     1                    But essentially they would issue an access code, if

     2           you will.  From that time on standard Webserver technology

     3           would do the verification for you.  It would ask for the

     4           password whenever somebody came in.

     5                    So in terms of asking for passwords, this is not a

     6           problem, standard software that does that.  In terms of doing

     7           the verification, you would have to write some CDI code that

     8           actually goes out and calls IC verifier, whoever else you

     9           decide is your provider of that.

    10                    I don't believe that's a difficult code to write,

    11           but it would take some time.

    12                    Does that help clarify?

    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yeah, that does to a certain

    14           extent, it does.  Thank you.

    15                    You may proceed, I don't have any other.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah, I have a few questions for you

    17           of starting with chat rooms or news groups.  Let's assume a

    18           chat group is talking about the CDA and its students are

    19           talking about the CDA, students varying in age from 13 to 18. 

    20           And in the course of the chat an 18 year old, exasperated by

    21           his or her view of the law, types in "Fuck the CDA."  Is it

    22           your proposal that before he types in "Fuck the CDA" he

    23           should tag that minus L18?

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I beg your pardon?
                                                                            54

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, so that is the -- so that

     3           anybody even in that context must tag, that's your -- the way

     4           it works?

     5                    THE WITNESS:  If they want to identify -- if they

     6           want to identify their speech that is one way they can do it,

     7           yes.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And protect themselves because,

     9           after all, that is one of the seven dirty words.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  We've had a lot of testimony

    12           in this case about caching.  Do you know what caching is?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I do.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And since it's also agreed, I think

    15           it's not in dispute, that upwards of 40 percent of the

    16           sexually explicit content comes from offshore, at least we've

    17           heard testimony about that.  I don't think that's an issue

    18           but  very significant percentage is offshore, but that it can

    19           get, it does get cached on this side. 

    20                    Is it feasible in your judgment for the entity that

    21           is doing the caching to tag one, let us say the people in

    22           Amsterdam won't tag?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  Let me -- if I could

    24           characterize a legal presumption for you and I may be wrong

    25           on the legal aspects of this, but  I'm under the assumption,
                                                                            55

     1           which may be wrong, that the transmitters of the information

     2           are not liable under this act.  My presumption is that only

     3           the creators or the people who served the information are

     4           liable.

     5                    The caching you describe is a standard computer

     6           science technique in communications and the caching, to

     7           computer scientists, will be considered part of the

     8           communication mechanism.

     9                    For example, it doesn't' work for telephones, but we

    10           would consider the cache site as much like your phone switch

    11           and whoever operates the phone switch isn't responsible for

    12           what you say.

    13                    So, yes, it is being stored, but it's being stored

    14           as an optimization of the communication process.  Now, I may

    15           be wrong in my legal assumption, but my legal assumption

    16           would be that they're not -- the people who have caches are

    17           not even considered under the law.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, but I think you've assumed

    19           away my question.  What I'm trying to get at is the technical

    20           feasibility of the cacher --

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Mm-hmm.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- okay, the cacher doing the

    23           tagging.

    24                    THE WITNESS:  That would be very difficult, that

    25           would be very difficult because generally the cacher has no
                                                                            56

     1           idea of what it is.  All they've done is a stream of bits

     2           came across that had a particular name.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And what if the lawyers for the

     4           cacher said you know, you may be wrong in your interpretation

     5           of the statute, you may be deemed the re-publisher?  What

     6           then?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  If I was them I'd hire a lawyer and

     8           fight that, but --

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, okay, well --

    10                    THE WITNESS:  -- it's a legal, it's a legal

    11           presumption that, you know, if they did that, then obviously

    12           I'm going to have to do something, I think.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What would you do?  That's what I'm

    14           trying to get at.

    15                    THE WITNESS:  If I was a cacher?

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes.  Let's assume you had

    17           definitive ruling that caching is a republication of the

    18           improper content?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  I'd turn the cacher off.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, you wouldn't tag?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  No.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Because it's too much bother.  I'd

    24           turn the cacher off, everything slows down and, I mean, this

    25           is not a nice thing to have happen on the Internet but if --
                                                                            57

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, why isn't it a nice thing to

     2           have on the Internet?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Everything slows down.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Anything that slows it down is not a

     5           nice thing?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Not in my view.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Well, I think a lot of

     8           witnesses would agree with you on that.  

     9                    All right, I want to talk about standards now.  You

    10           in your declaration speak warmly of -- I think the word you

    11           used was the "nurturing" of the Government for the Internet,

    12           okay?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Mm-hmm. 

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Am I not correct though that

    15           the Government did not establish a single standard that

    16           creates the actual operation of the Internet as we use it

    17           today?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Uhm, let me characterize what I think

    19           you mean by or at least what I think I mean by establish a

    20           standard.  If you mean establish a standard to mean somebody

    21           like the FCC created a regulation which everybody has to sort

    22           of conform to, no.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No, I mean IP-4, I mean IP-4.

    24                    THE WITNESS:  If you mean -- well, if you mean, so,

    25           no, there is no legislation that I'm aware of that says this
                                                                            58

     1           is what IP-4 is.  On the other hand, the nurturing that I

     2           talked about is that the creation of IP-4 and the money for

     3           the researchers that did much of the early work, well, most

     4           of it came from Government money.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, that's to open that because

     6           that was -- that's all the history because that was in the

     7           defense business, right, the defense research.

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Right.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And that's all you were talking

    10           about, right?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  That's right. 

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because can you -- can you tell me,

    13           can you identify for me any Government official who

    14           participated in writing IP-4?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  No, you'd have to ask Mr. Bradner,

    16           he's more expert in that area.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  He couldn't think of anybody either. 

    18           But what I'm getting at is the standards therefore, of course

    19           you say in your declaration that the Internet has to have

    20           standards to operate, no one disagrees with that, the

    21           question is whether it has governmental standards, that is to

    22           say governmentally imposed standards.  Wouldn't you agree

    23           that's the real question here?

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Not completely, not completely in the

    25           sense that let's take for example the creation of the
                                                                            59

     1           Arpanet.  In the creation of the Arpanet the military said we

     2           need a way to communicate that is resilient to adverse things

     3           like nuclear war, I think Mr. Bradner stated, so they

     4           established a goal that says, you know, we will pay you money

     5           if you will create for us a communication medium that has the

     6           following attributes.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right, and they created the packet

     8           switching.

     9                    THE WITNESS:  Right.  The CDA has established a goal

    10           but has not dictated any technology standards nor have I

    11           proposed they do so.  They have only established a goal and

    12           left it to the community to come up with technical solutions

    13           that achieve that goal.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I thought you've testified to us

    15           that a governmentally imposed standard, let's assume either

    16           we or the Supreme Court of the United States whose going to

    17           review what we do says Dr. Olsen is right, we've had a

    18           Damascus Road experience here, minus L18 is the answer.  That

    19           will then have the force of law, will it not?  And so anybody

    20           who doesn't tag with minus L18 doesn't have the safe harbor

    21           that Mr. Coppolino says they have, isn't that right?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  To the extent that the Supreme Court

    23           said L18 is the answer, that would be true.  To the extent

    24           that the Supreme Court said that tagging is the answer, that

    25           would not be true because we could use PICs, we could use
                                                                            60

     1           L18, we could use XXX, we could invent something else

     2           provided it met the goal.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  My point is once the Supreme Court

     4           or any court definitively holds that a method is a safe

     5           harbor, it's then a legally imposed standard, is it not?  Not

     6           a scientifically imposed standard.

     7                    THE WITNESS:  I would have to beg the question on

     8           that because I just don't know enough about how the Supreme

     9           Court enforces anything.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Others enforce it; you're looking at

    11           them.

    12                    (Laughter.)

    13                    THE WITNESS:  I believe President Jackson objected,

    14           but that was a long time  ago.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's a long time ago.

    16                    (Laughter.)

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I think that's all I have.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Dr. Olsen, would you first satisfy

    19           my curiosity?  At the very beginning of today's questioning

    20           you were asked, you mentioned that you built some software.

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What did -- I wanted to know what

    23           the next question was -- what did your software do?  What

    24           kind of software were you talking about in that colloquy with

    25           counsel?
                                                                            61

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Okay, they're a variety, there are

     2           actually a variety of pieces of software that were in that

     3           and we were focused on my work that has related to

     4           interacting over the Internet.  

     5                    Perhaps the first one I could characterize for you

     6           is let us suppose that you and I were both chip designers,

     7           microchip designers.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It's not likely from this

     9           standpoint, but go ahead.

    10                    (Laughter.)

    11                    THE WITNESS:  It's as good as some of the other

    12           hypotheticals we've had, so let's suppose that we are and we,

    13           you are here in Philadelphia and I am in Utah and we would

    14           like-- 

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  More likely.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  More likely.  And we would want to

    17           collaborate on this design.  What we would like to do is we

    18           would like to have you bring up the design on your machine

    19           and I would bring it up on my machine, and when I made a

    20           change, a message goes over the Internet and you see what I

    21           just did.  When you make a change, the reverse thing happens.

    22                    So we developed a protocol and the user interface

    23           architecture to make that work.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I see.

    25                    THE WITNESS:  That was one of the pieces.  There are
                                                                            62

     1           variations of other kinds of --

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is that available now?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  There are things that will do that. 

     4           They don't necessarily use our technology, it was a prototype

     5           that hasn't been widely adopted yet, but there are other

     6           software that does that similar idea.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right.  Let me go into the

     8           final series of questions.

     9                    Do you think it is likely that there will be -- that

    10           they will ultimately develop, if -- if the idea of tagging

    11           catches on, is it likely that there would ultimately develop

    12           two separate tagging systems, i.e., minus L18 and PICs as a

    13           practical matter?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  If the technical people were left to

    15           themselves that would probably happen.  I believe it will not

    16           happen for the following reasons: to the extent that the

    17           technical people start to argue with each other about and not

    18           come to a consensus, they're far more afraid of the FCC than

    19           they are of each other so they would probably come to a

    20           consensus very quickly because they just don't want anybody

    21           else messing in their part.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I'm afraid I don't understand what

    23           the FCC has to do with this --

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Oh --

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- nor do I understand -- yes.
                                                                            63

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Internet people very much don't like

     2           outside people telling them what to do, so they would rather

     3           come to a consensus than be told what they have to do.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And who would make this decision

     5           then, would it be the market that would make the decision as

     6           to whether you go with PICs or with minus L18?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  There are a couple of ways that they

     8           can do.  There already is a large amount of market momentum

     9           behind PICs.  Once you get Netscape, Microsoft and Apple

    10           committed, most everybody else becomes irrelevant.  They

    11           will, those three organizations are big enough that even if

    12           one of them said this was the standard, it would push the

    13           market almost immediately.

    14                    So let's say it's PICs.  But another thing that

    15           might happen is having read this transcript, Netscape might

    16           decide well, hey, we could screen for minus L18, too, that's

    17           easy, it only takes us 20 minutes to put the code in, and

    18           they might just do -- put multiple screens in simply because

    19           isn't hard and because they just don't want to quarrel about

    20           the problem, they just do both and be happy.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So then minus L18 is more

    22           theoretical and since you're -- I know that's a conclusion

    23           but since you are the creator, I feel as though a fair

    24           question to ask you, was created as a hypothetical, as a

    25           technical possibility that shows what would be available
                                                                            64

     1           rather than as a proffer of something that could be put in

     2           relatively promptly to comply with the statute, and that is a

     3           question.

     4                    THE WITNESS:  That is -- that is correct.  I would

     5           not characterize myself as having enormous influence on the

     6           market, Mr. Gates would.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  This is your 15 minutes of fame.

     8                    (Laughter.)

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, I think he's going to have more

    10           than 15 minutes.  

    11                    So that under your proposal, you're suggestion is

    12           that somebody -- and we'll get into the "somebody" in a few

    13           minutes -- would label everything, every content that is

    14           potentially within the statute, is that -- is that right?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  Correct.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Falls within the statute.

    17                    THE WITNESS:  I think you've sort of characterized

    18           the conservative labeling strategy that someone might take.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, I thought that that was your

    20           answer to the questions from Mr. Ennis mostly.

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Right.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  But that covers, does it

    23           not, only material of concern to parents and otherwise

    24           dealing with checks in some way and rather than with other

    25           problems that might concern parents more?
                                                                            65

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Sure.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Such as with violence, for example,

     3           is that right?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct.  The only reason I --

     5           the only reason I narrowed what I responded to in that area

     6           is I was responding specifically to the CDA.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, that's right, and that's what

     8           your minus L18.

     9                    Now, in your proposal is there any way in which

    10           there could be a distinction between the type of content,

    11           like for example there are some parents who are -- would be

    12           concerned about material that they consider sacrilegious, for

    13           example, although it would not fall within the CDA, correct?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And some as I mentioned with

    16           violence.

    17                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And some might not be concerned at

    19           all with sex because they think their kids just couldn't care

    20           less, and having seen Mr. Coppolino's book, you know, they

    21           might realize that they just see one picture and turn it off,

    22           there would be no way under your proposal if it were to be

    23           the successful winner in the marketplace, let us say, to

    24           advise the parents or the adults of the type of material that

    25           the labeler thought was minus L18, is that right?
                                                                            66

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, that's correct.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  At least as the proposal stands

     3           now.

     4                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct and there is a valid

     5           statement which it seems to me is outside the discussion of

     6           the CDA, but there is a valid interest on a lot of parents to

     7           get information on more than just what CDA is concerned with,

     8           as you characterized, and PICs is actually assigned to

     9           address that larger -- that larger context.

    10                    To the extent that the content providers do the

    11           labeling, I'm quite happy with PICs.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, well, what is it then about

    13           PICs that you're not happy about?  I mean why did you then,

    14           since this idea of PICs has gone out into the sort of

    15           literature, literature that you rather than I are more

    16           familiar with, what was it then that inspired you to research

    17           into an alternate system such as minus L18?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Two things.  Two things, one of them

    19           was assertions in declaration and in testimony by Mr. Bradner

    20           that certain kinds of materials could not be tagged.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Was that -- I'd have to go back

    22           because his testimony was sort of long, very long and very

    23           technical.

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And very difficult to understand. 
                                                                            67

     1           Was it technologically could not be tagged or -- I forget. 

     2           I'd have to --

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  He said it was very difficult, as I

     4           recall.

     5                    THE WITNESS:  There are two -- there are two points

     6           that he made.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah.

     8                    THE WITNESS:  One of them was that if I have data

     9           which has some proscribed format like a JIF (ph.) image, I

    10           believe we talked about on Friday, then putting the tag

    11           inside the data, you couldn't do that.  And he's right. 

    12           That's why, you know, I looked and said he's right, is there

    13           another way?  And another way would be to tag the name.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Hmm.

    15                    THE WITNESS:  Another way also would be to use a

    16           database on the side which is one of the architectures

    17           proposed in PICs that contain the tag and that would work,

    18           too.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Would the technical possibilities

    20           that your declaration sets forth as to where the tag could be

    21           put, I think you said three places, the server, et cetera.

    22                    THE WITNESS:  That's where it could be filtered, not

    23           where it could be put.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Filtered, would that work as well

    25           for PICs as for minus L18?
                                                                            68

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  One of the reasons I picked

     2           minus L18 is because I knew I could configure the Netscope

     3           proxy server and the Netscape Web server today to do that.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mm-hmm.

     5                    THE WITNESS:  But since Netscape is so excited about

     6           PICs, I assume that they'll have a product out very soon that

     7           would do exactly the same thing with relative to PICs labels.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So that that reason, at least, and

     9           I don't want to put words in your mouth but I want to

    10           question, so that reason for developing minus L18 could be

    11           solved with PICs, could it not?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I guess --

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You said there were two reasons

    14           then for developing minus L18.  What was the other?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  The other one had related to a

    16           different argument that Mr. Bradner made that was related to

    17           the filtering we just talked about.  I think he said

    18           something about he knew of no software that could be

    19           configured to do the filtering and again I put together a

    20           counter example.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I see.  So that with your computer

    22           genius, and I mean that just as I say it, you know, true

    23           computer genius, would the -- and with what you have shown

    24           through your declaration and your testimony and your

    25           experience in your work that will take place in Carnegie-
                                                                            69

     1           Mellon, would the problems that you saw with PICs be

     2           technologically soluble?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  My number one complaint with PICs has

     4           to do with the concept of a label bureau, okay?  And there, I

     5           have two complaints there.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But that's -- excuse me -- that's

     7           not a technical problem --

     8                    THE WITNESS:   Well, no, it isn't.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, go ahead. 

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Yeah, it is a technical problem and

    11           there are two.  One of them is the problems of building a

    12           database that keeps track of an exponentially growing set of

    13           things you're trying to monitor, that's my -- 

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, uh-huh.

    15                    THE WITNESS:  The other problem is that the way PICs

    16           would have -- the way a label bureau would be implemented, it

    17           actually does slow down the way a user would get access to

    18           their material.

    19                    And if I could, without getting into acronyms --

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, but you're going to.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, go ahead, everybody else has.

    22                    (Laughter.)

    23                    THE WITNESS:  I know, I read their testimony.  I've

    24           tried very hard to stay away from them.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And the Court's impatience.
                                                                            70

     1                    (Laughter.)

     2                    THE WITNESS:  If I'm sitting at the browser much as

     3           Mr. Schmidt showed us on Friday and I click on --

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You mean Mr. -- when Mr. Schmidt

     5           showed us this --

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Right, when he led you through the

     7           Worldwide Web.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  On the -- on the screen?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah.

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, that whole demo.  When I click on

    12           something, what has to happen right now is that name comes

    13           into the software, we identify from that name something

    14           called the domain which effectively identifies the computer I

    15           want to talk to.

    16                    I open a connection to that computer like making a

    17           phone call and I sent it the rest of my request.  Their

    18           server software will then try to fill that request and will

    19           send me the information back.  So I've got an over and a

    20           back.

    21                    If the messages are small, my dominant cost is the

    22           amount of time it goes over and back, and that really is a

    23           problem.  Now, with the label bureau, if I want to have a

    24           label bureau interposed, then the following thing has to

    25           occur:  my software gets the URL and before it goes and
                                                                            71

     1           contacts with the information, it first has to go over and

     2           back to the label bureau saying is this clear and give me the

     3           label.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mm-hmm.

     5                    THE WITNESS:  Then I decide if I like the label and

     6           then I go again over and back to actually get the

     7           information.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is the "I" in this hypothetical the

     9           parent?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  The parent, the software that the

    11           parent has installed, the software is actually doing this.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So, in other words, it's going to

    13           take a little more time.  So that if Judge Dalzell, who is

    14           the only one among us who has any minor children at home, so

    15           if Judge Dalzell were to go on the Internet, would it slow

    16           down his or his children's receipt of the information?  Is

    17           that what -- I'm trying to find out --

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, yes.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  And --

    20                    THE WITNESS:  What it means that instead of an over

    21           and back, I now have two of those and those are the most

    22           expensive part of the transaction.

    23                    It's also complicated by the fact that if this is a

    24           popular label bureau, lots of people are trying to do an over

    25           and back to that label bureau.  In the PIC spec this is
                                                                            72

     1           termed a hot spot because that potentially becomes a

     2           bottleneck.

     3                    They have proposed some solutions to that which

     4           essentially allow me to have multiple label bureaus, but they

     5           haven't tested them yet.  I --

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, a lot of this all hasn't been

     7           testing --

     8                    THE WITNESS:  I'm actually, I mean in a technical

     9           judgment I think the scheme they have proposed to alleviate

    10           that hot spot problem is probably reasonable and I would not

    11           contest them on that.

    12                    But we still have this over and back, over and back

    13           twice as much for every access. 

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So it adds cost or it adds an extra

    15           minute to Judge Dalzell's children when they want to reach

    16           the material?  I'm just trying to find out what we're talking

    17           about in practicality.

    18                    THE WITNESS:  If it inhibits the flow, if I'm

    19           allowed to say that?

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Everybody else did.

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Everybody else did.  I mean it

    23           actually makes everything much more sluggish than it would

    24           normally be.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But by sluggish in computer
                                                                            73

     1           language we mean that they get it in a minute or two later

     2           than they would have otherwise had to get it?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Well, if you ever sat down and used

     4           the Worldwide Web.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, I tried.

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, well, if you ever used it, I mean

     7           a minute is absolutely unreasonable, I mean just -- this is a

     8           getting into the user interface side of my world, people will

     9           not put up with a minute.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Of course when one thinks of what

    11           the alternatives are, which we'll get into in a minute, in my

    12           minute here, which means blocking the whole thing --

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Right.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- and that might be a balance one

    15           would accept.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If it means -- well, okay.  All

    18           right.

    19                    THE WITNESS:  I guess --

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, go ahead.

    21                    THE WITNESS:  One point to make there.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.

    23                    THE WITNESS:  And that is if you have, if however

    24           under PICs the content providers, Webserver is providing the

    25           label and there is a proposal on PICs as to how the content
                                                                            74

     1           provider would be serving that label, then you don't need,

     2           then it's the same traffic that we had before. 

     3                    And the other thing is if you use a label and the

     4           name such as L18, for those materials that aren't related to

     5           the statute at all there is no overhead whatsoever.  Whereas

     6           in PICs with the label bureau, I don't know until I make the

     7           first request whether or not I should block or not so

     8           everything has to be checked.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, under the minus L18 scheme,

    10           and I use the word "scheme" because that was your use of the

    11           word and also the Government's, somebody would have to make a

    12           judgment call right at the beginning and until -- from what

    13           you testified, until the judgment call is made and we leave

    14           aside because that's not within the scope of your testimony

    15           the whole question of judgment calls and I don't intend to

    16           ask you about that -- but during that period then students,

    17           for example, Judge Dalzell's -- and the judgment call would

    18           be made on the basis, as you said, that if there was a sexual

    19           organ showing, then that would until somebody passed it

    20           through or something or never passed it through, it would be

    21           labeled L18 and it would then be blocked.  I think that's a

    22           fair characterization.

    23                    THE WITNESS:  That's -- that's fair.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I have noticed that you'll -- if

    25           I'm not you can take care of yourself and you'll tell us--
                                                                            75

     1           then Judge Dalzell's children, whom I have never met, Judge

     2           Dalzell's children or other students would be blocked at

     3           least initially from bringing up on their screen parts of

     4           museum collections, sculpture, for example, which is replete

     5           with sexual organs showing, is that right?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  And, yes, it would depend on how long

     7           it actually took this museum to sort of clear the

     8           information, if you will, but during that period of time when

     9           they made a conservative judgment and then considered it more

    10           deeply, during that period of time, yes, it would be blocked.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But is it true that suggestive

    12           topics that in which the sexual organs are covered such as

    13           the, what they tell me is the swimsuit issue of Sports

    14           Illustrated would not be blocked?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  Well, that would be a judgment call

    16           that would have to be made by the server of the information

    17           and how conservative or how liberal or how preemptive they

    18           wanted to be, I'm sure they would decide with counsel.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, under your system, once you

    20           blocked a museum with -- I don't remember if it was you or

    21           somebody else -- with its pictures of Indian statutes and in

    22           not only suggestive but very obvious sexual interludes and

    23           some Japanese, I think that there are lots of Japanese,

    24           famous Japanese prints that might have some of them, how do

    25           they get unblocked for -- on an individual basis, you know,
                                                                            76

     1           technically what is your plan how they get unblocked so that

     2           a viewer can see it, an under 18 viewer can see it?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Sort of -- sort of getting a grasp on

     4           this, assuming that the provider has made a judgment that

     5           they ought to be blocked for minors for whatever reason --

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The provider -- the provider, I

     7           gather from what you said the provider would say I'd better

     8           make this L18.  It wouldn't be the creator because those

     9           creators are dead, so let's say the provider.  The provider

    10           has made under your hypothetical a decision under your scheme

    11           that anything showing a sexual act comes within the CDA.  And

    12           that goes -- and that becomes L18.

    13                    How can either a teacher or a Judge Dalzell or

    14           somebody else say wait a minute, I want individual items on

    15           this showing, how does that work technically is what I'm

    16           asking. 

    17                    THE WITNESS:  A teacher or a parent who felt for

    18           whatever reason that it was appropriate, actually they did

    19           want to show this, they could log onto the Worldwide Web,

    20           they could download those pictures, they could store them on

    21           their own hard disk and then they could print them or they

    22           could display them in class or whatever way they wanted to.

    23                    So an adult could use their authority as an adult to

    24           retrieve the material and then do whatever they pleased with

    25           it.
                                                                            77

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Wouldn't that slow the flow?

     2                    (Laughter.)

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Assuming it was legal, I don't know

     4           whether it's legal for --

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Neither do I at this point.

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, assuming it was legal for the

     7           teacher to sort of have created a flow experience related to

     8           these, then the teacher could actually put together a small

     9           Web site locally within the classroom which actually is --

    10           doesn't require all the overheard that's necessary to

    11           distribute one on the Internet.

    12                    Their putting those up in files so the students

    13           could readily access them in class is not technologically a

    14           problem.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, you said that the blocker --

    16           obviously the minus L18 system works, would work only

    17           effectively in conjunction with a blocker and you made that

    18           very clear.  And you also made clear that the blocker could

    19           be at different places and they were, if maybe you'll -- one

    20           was in the server.

    21                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And what were the other two?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Another one is in the proxy server.  I

    24           can explain that if you want me to but --

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think you did.
                                                                            78

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, and the third?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  And the third is at the actual client

     4           software, the browser or the E-mail leader.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And the client in that case is

     6           Judge Dalzell or is it --

     7                    THE WITNESS:  It is the software that Judge Dalzell

     8           has put on his computer.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Not Judge Dalzell individually.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.  I keep forgetting

    11           that clients mean different things to lawyers than they do to

    12           computer scientists.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's right.  Well, I was thinking

    14           of the ultimate consumer, the user.

    15                    Is it technologically feasible to have the blocker

    16           in different places under this scheme or does a decision have

    17           to be made somewhere at the inception as to where the blocker

    18           would be?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  What do you mean -- what do you mean

    20           by inception?

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, your system is not yet in

    22           effect.

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Oh, okay.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  When the system goes into

    25           effect, if the system goes into effect --
                                                                            79

     1                    THE WITNESS:  If Mr. Gates adopts it, let's say.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, but if Mr. Gates adopts it

     3           and then somebody else adopts it and America On Line, he's

     4           not America On Line, adopts it --

     5                    THE WITNESS:  No.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- does there have to be, does

     7           everybody have to decide at some point that minus L18, that

     8           part of minus L18 becomes effective because it is blocked at

     9           one spot?  Does this question show the technological lack of

    10           aptitude of the question or, I mean --

    11                    THE WITNESS:  No, I guess -- I think I understand

    12           what your question is.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  And we've got a lot of places in the

    15           stream that we could essentially cut.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's what you testified, yes.

    17                    THE WITNESS:  And the answer is we could cut all of

    18           them, we could cut any one of them.  I mean we're completely

    19           free in terms of the software providers.  America On Line,

    20           for example, which controls both the proxy server and the

    21           client software in many cases could say, you know, I'll put

    22           it at the proxy server or they could say well, I want to

    23           provide you this service at my browser.  They could choose

    24           anywhere they wanted if they felt they wanted to offer that

    25           service to their customers.
                                                                            80

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  You mentioned that in order

     2           to be effective under the CDA mentioned today and I think

     3           Friday also, but I think mostly today, the question of this

     4           potentially 40 percent of material and certainly this kind of

     5           material, I gather, emanating from abroad and you suggested

     6           well, if Surfwatch was -- 

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Which is really a very new group

     8           also and I recall it's been in existence --

     9                    THE WITNESS:  Oh -- 

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- for about three months or six

    11           months or --

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  July, July of '95.

    13                    THE WITNESS:  They're farther along than the PICs

    14           labeling bureaus but, yes, they are quite new.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And PICs may be farther along than

    16           minus L18, I guess.

    17                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  So that what we're talking

    19           about throughout this are proposals that have not yet been

    20           effectuated and that we really don't, nobody sees really how

    21           they would operate in actuality.  We know your testimony is

    22           they can, but it was just a response to your -- but you

    23           suggested that if Surfwatch or any of the blockers didn't

    24           have to worry about the 60 percent or whatever amount comes

    25           out emanates from this country, then they could concentrate
                                                                            81

     1           on the material that came from the book, is that --

     2                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- that's a fair statement.  But

     4           Surfwatch, as I recall, hopes to be a commercially viable

     5           entity and I assume that most of these, unless some are run

     6           by churches or the Boy Scouts or some group like that, I

     7           think most of them in this country -- well, in this world you

     8           get successful if you make money -- is it feasible that if

     9           they didn't, if the blocker groups didn't have the income

    10           from blocking the 60 percent that emanates here because there

    11           would be mostly a different kind of system because they

    12           wouldn't have to do it, as you suggested, but they could make

    13           it commercially feasible by just existing on reviewing the

    14           material that emanates from abroad?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  Well, a little bit out of my area but

    16           I think I can help you here.  That for someone like Surfwatch

    17           or Net Nanny, the key to their market, the key to their

    18           income is the level of concern that parents feel about the

    19           availability of the material.

    20                    So to the extent that parents suddenly feel less

    21           concern because of PICs or L18 or something else and in

    22           conjunction with the CDA because they now have some

    23           confidence that a lot of people are going to label, to the

    24           extent that their concern might be reduced then you have

    25           potential customer base for Surfwatch is reduced.  To the
                                                                            82

     1           extent that Surfwatch can clearly market to these people that

     2           there's still a lot of stuff in France or Germany or whatever

     3           that you might want to protect your children from, then they

     4           would still be successful.

     5                    The size of their market doesn't change.  What does

     6           change is the size of the perceived concern.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And the -- wouldn't it also change

     8           the extent of what they have to do?  Because if they're not

     9           busy, see, it was your answer that raised my question.  If

    10           they are not busy with the 60 percent domestic material, then

    11           they're not going to get income from whatever it is that

    12           they're doing over the 60 percent.

    13                    THE WITNESS:  No, what it means, it means that label

    14           costs go down, assuming that their income stays -- they still

    15           are selling the same number of subscriptions, if their label

    16           costs go down it becomes more profitable. 

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, oh -- I want to go back to

    18           something that you said, I'm finishing up, about pre-

    19           screening.  You said in the central part of this, of course,

    20           involves pre-screening the material before so that anything

    21           L18 would be pre-screened by somebody.

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Can you help me with pre-screened just

    23           a little bit?

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, I don't know because it's

    25           your word, so I was going to ask you.  I had -- I wrote 
                                                                            83

     1           that -- wrote it down.

     2                    Your response --

     3                    THE WITNESS:  There's two cases --

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah.

     5                    THE WITNESS:  Yeah, there's two cases and maybe you

     6           could clarify which one you're concerned about.  One's --

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Tell me about both; tell us about

     8           them.

     9                    THE WITNESS:  Yeah, one is the transition case

    10           proposed by Mr. Hansen which is, you know, by 6:15 I have 

    11           to--

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, that's pretty unrealistic, 

    13           so -- 

    14                    THE WITNESS:  But let's suppose within the next two,

    15           three months I have to somehow do something with 14,000

    16           pages.  So that's the transit -- and so one thing I said that

    17           you might do is, you know, take an initial preliminary screen

    18           that's fairly conservative.  So if that's not the case you

    19           want--

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, I'm asking about Mr. Jensen, I

    21           guess it was Mr. Jensen's supposed -- what was the issue?

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Mr. Hansen?

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What was the -- Ennis, Mr. Ennis'

    24           question.  What was -- there was an issue.  He asked you

    25           today about what happens on the morning when the library puts
                                                                            84

     1           Vanity Fair out, wants to put Vanity Fair on line.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And it has the picture of Demi Moore

     3           on the cover.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, or something that it doesn't

     5           really know.  You said well, at that point they could block

     6           the whole thing until they pre-screened, was that the

     7           response?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Oh, yeah, one of the possible

     9           approaches is that I can sort of do this triage thing which

    10           says, you know, there's a whole bunch of stuff that I just

    11           know isn't going to be sexually explicit so I don't care, I

    12           don't label it.  There is a whole bunch of stuff that I know

    13           is, and so I just automatically label that.  And then I've

    14           got this middle piece which might be on the border line, so

    15           one possible thing to do is I'll just conservatively screen

    16           it for now and let some people look at it a little more

    17           carefully.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So that at the essence of your

    19           proposal would -- is it true that at the essence of your

    20           proposal you have screening and blocking of material in

    21           advance of its dissemination that includes a great deal of

    22           material that is not offensive to anybody, is that correct? 

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Uhm, well, I guess part of my answer

    24           there is to the extent you feel you need to screen, if I was

    25           running my department library electronically, for example, I
                                                                            85

     1           would never even look in communications to the ACM for

     2           sexually explicit material and if by chance something got

     3           through, I would just profusely apologize afterwards.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, but if you --

     5                    THE WITNESS:  But a large amount of material, a

     6           large amount of the 2500 magazines that Mr. Ennis pointed to

     7           is that kind of material.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But if you were an anthropologist,

     9           for example, or a library dealing with anthropology like the

    10           university, you're at Philadelphia, like the Museum of the

    11           University of Pennsylvania which has a lot of anthropological

    12           material, some statues, might have magazines, it's a magazine

    13           that has some other material.  You might have to pre-screen

    14           or block to be safe, would you not?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  Well --

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  At least for some period of time.

    17                    THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I guess --

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No matter how short?  I mean is

    19           that, is that -- what I'm trying to find out is that part of

    20           your scheme.

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  I guess part of what I'd like to

    22           point there is that libraries in any of this kind of

    23           classification and this is a classification task, that's what

    24           it is.  Any of these classification tasks they don't act

    25           alone, they have consortia that they've created so that every
                                                                            86

     1           individual library doesn't have to go to the work of doing

     2           this.

     3                    And in some cases libraries have just pushed back on

     4           the publishers and said: you do the screen or I don't want to

     5           see your stuff.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But what I'm asking is whether in

     7           essence this system, your scheme will house within it your

     8           blocking of some material in advance -- well, material in

     9           advance, period.  And can you think of any time in our

    10           history when we have blocked access to material in advance?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Uhm, yes, every editor does this every

    12           day on a newspaper.  I mean --

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, well, that we have done this in

    14           an organized fashion in advance --

    15                    THE WITNESS:  Oh, but, again every editor does this

    16           on his newspaper.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- because of the law.

    18                    Do you think -- would your -- just answer one more

    19           technological question then.  If minus L18 became the

    20           prevalent response to the CDA and the Government became or--

    21           well, the Government became dissatisfied with the pace at

    22           which it was going, for one reason or another, would it

    23           contain the seeds of the possibility that the Government

    24           would do the blocking, technologically?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  Speculating on what the Government
                                                                            87

     1           might or might not --

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, I'm just asking whether

     3           technologically if one put minus L18 into effect as the

     4           prevalent response, would it facilitate from a technological

     5           standpoint the Government's doing the judgment call as to

     6           what goes out?  Because everything would already be tagged.

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Well, in other words, I guess there's

     8           two questions.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  In other words, once everything

    10           gets tagged as minus 18, minus L18.

    11                    THE WITNESS:   Mm-hmm.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Would it -- would that facilitate

    13           any one entity, whether it's the Government or the church or

    14           some other entity, saying this is material that should not go

    15           out on the Internet?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  If I can characterize this, does this

    17           create, does it make it technologically easier for the

    18           Government to overtly sensor material, if they chose to do?

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Pre-sensor, yes.  

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Possibly.  I assume that you would do

    21           something in your capacity to prevent that.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you very much.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  May I just follow up on something

    24           prompted by Chief Judge Sloviter's questions?  Just to recap

    25           the testimony we have heard, the technical testimony we've
                                                                            88

     1           heard over five days here, we heard that Surfwatch came into

     2           existence in July of 1995.  We heard that Microsoft, our

     3           friend, Mr. Gates and his pals, announced that they were

     4           going to go into PICs, I think it was February 28th, 20 days

     5           after the CDA went into effect.  And one fine day about two

     6           weeks ago I think you testified that you came up with your

     7           colleagues with the minus L18, correct?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Mm-hmm.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Wait, he didn't -- there is no

    10           answer on that --

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Or just a minus L18.  So your

    13           proposal is two weeks old, Surfwatch is less than a year old,

    14           okay.  The PICs I take it we also agree is now a reality. 

    15           That is to say once, you said once Microsoft said we're in,

    16           that PICs got its reality the moment that happened.

    17                    THE WITNESS:  Well, to the extent that marketing

    18           pitches by computer companies constitute reality.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, that will do, won't it?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  What?

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That will do for reality, won't it?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Well, with a minor quibble about what

    23           marketing people say, yes.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I mean I thought the testimony here

    25           has been that PICs is not only a theory, PICs is being
                                                                            89

     1           adopted as we speak.  Is that not true?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  But there is -- there is no actual

     3           software on the market.  That's my -- that's my only quibble

     4           is --

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But the testimony was -- and I want

     6           to know if you disagree with it -- testimony was it will be

     7           operation-- it will be operative in three to six months?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  I believe that.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Is minus L18 -- if we said

    10           today this is it, this is the safe harbor, could you be

    11           operative in three to six months?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  To the same level that PICs is, it

    13           could be operative sooner, it's easier.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  And so my final question to

    15           you is this: we have Surfwatch since July of 1995, we have

    16           PICs as baptized by Mr. Gates on February 28th, 1996, we have

    17           minus L18 as brought into the world by Dan Olsen and his

    18           pals, let's say -- let's say April 1, 1996, okay?  At any

    19           point along that continuum of time would it have made sense

    20           to freeze this process?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  No.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Would it make sense today to freeze

    23           this process?

    24                    THE WITNESS:  No.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, thank you.  
                                                                            90

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Did our questions elicit questions

     2           from counsel?

     3                    MR. HANSEN:  If I might, your Honor, I have just a

     4           couple.

     5                            FURTHER RECROSS-EXAMINATION

     6           BY MR. HANSEN:  

     7           Q   I'm Christopher Hansen, one of the lawyers for plaintiffs

     8           in the ACLU case.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  When you sit up here I thought you

    10           get the last word, but that comes later.  

    11                    Go ahead.

    12           BY MR. HANSEN:  

    13           Q   Good morning. I just want to ask a couple of questions

    14           about news groups that were prompted by the Court's question. 

    15           Is it technologically true that if you post a message to a

    16           news group today I have the ability to alter what is written

    17           in your subject line?

    18           A   I'm not sure how you would do that.  I would be reluctant

    19           to say that it's completely impossible but, frankly, I don't

    20           know how you'd do that.

    21           Q   Let's assume that you posted a message to a news group

    22           today and tagged it L18 in the subject line.  Just doing that

    23           fact would not today prevent a single minor from reading your

    24           message, correct?

    25           A   Without screening software in effect, that is correct.
                                                                            91

     1           Q   And the screening software does not now exist, correct?

     2           A   That is correct.

     3           Q   So for the at least immediate future the only thing that

     4           can be done in the context of news groups is  that all speech

     5           has to be suitable for minors, is that correct?

     6           A   That is correct.

     7                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you, I have nothing further.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  

     9                            FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION

    10           BY MR. BARON:

    11           Q   Dr. Olsen, you talked about statistical assurance in your

    12           prior testimony.  Is it your testimony that if all the

    13           browser--

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do you want to, just for the tape

    15           because the person who writes this may not -- do you want to

    16           again identify so that it will be clear?

    17           BY MR. BARON:  

    18           Q   Dr. Olsen, you talked about statistical --

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, I mean with your name. 

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Identify yourself.

    21                    MR. BARON:  Oh, oh.  Jason R. Baron.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Tag yourself.

    23                    (Laughter.)

    24                    MR. BARON:  I'll label myself from the Justice

    25           Department, Jason R. Baron.
                                                                            92

     1           BY MR. BARON:  

     2           Q   In response to Mr. Hansen's last question you answered a

     3           question about USNet groups.  Now, with respect to your prior

     4           testimony about statistical assurance, if browsers in the

     5           marketplace could be configured to look at a tag or a label

     6           such as you proposed there would be a statistical assurance

     7           with respect to restrictions on minors for USNet, correct?

     8           A   To the extent that screening news readers were deployed,

     9           yes, you'd have statistical assurance.

    10           Q   All right.  There were a number of questions from the

    11           judges here.  Judge Buckwalter asked you about economic costs

    12           as opposed to technical costs, do you recall that question?

    13           A   Yes.

    14           Q   What are the economic costs to tagging or labeling with

    15           four key strokes minus L18 to the content creator?

    16           A   The technological costs are minimal, all costs that might

    17           be associated are the judgmental costs.

    18           Q   I asked about economic costs.

    19           A   Yeah, I mean -- yes, I mean in terms of actually

    20           performing the act of tagging it's how long does it take you

    21           to type four key strokes.

    22           Q   Now, on the other hand, what are the costs associated

    23           with the use of Surfwatch on the consumer end?

    24           A   The last time I looked at Surfwatch they wanted six

    25           dollars a week, I mean six dollars a month with some discount
                                                                            93

     1           for a yearly subscription and that would go on for as long as

     2           the Internet exists, I presume.

     3           Q   In terms of business models is it conceivable that there

     4           are costs to consumers for the use of third-party services in

     5           terms of protecting children from inappropriate material?

     6           A   My testimony characterized that the work required to be a

     7           label bureau or a Surfwatch or some third party is

     8           significant.  The only business model I've seen so far is

     9           that the consumers would incur that cost.

    10           Q   The matter of the Federal Communications Commission came

    11           up in your responses to prior questions from the Court.  Do

    12           you recall that?

    13           A   Yes.

    14           Q   Let me read, if the Court will indulge me, this is from

    15           E-5-6 of the Communications Decency Act.  The sentences say

    16           "The Commission," which is meant the Federal Communications

    17           Commission, "may describe measures which are reasonable,

    18           effective and appropriate to restrict access to prohibited

    19           communications under Subsection D.  Nothing in this section

    20           authorizes the Commission to enforce or is intended to

    21           provide the Commission with the authority to approve sanction

    22           or permit the use of such measures.  The Commission shall

    23           have no enforcement authority over the failure to utilize

    24           such measures.  The Commission shall not endorse specific

    25           products relating to such measures."
                                                                            94

     1                    With respect to this, these sentences, I'm not

     2           asking for a legal opinion but would your minus L18 proposal

     3           be the type of proposal that could constitute something that

     4           the FCC may discuss in response to this section of the

     5           statute?

     6           A   Certainly they could discuss that as a possibility.

     7           Q   Am I correct that you are not relying on U.S. imposed

     8           standards for the introduction of minus L18?

     9           A   No.  I -- I said no to -- I am not relying on the

    10           Government imposing standards, no.

    11           Q   And you haven't by anything that you've written in this

    12           action, your declaration or your prior testimony stated that

    13           there must be a mandatory tag that represents minus L18?

    14           A   No, I've tried to represent a range of things that people

    15           could do not requiring a Government mandate.

    16           Q   There could be multiple tags?

    17           A   Yes.

    18           Q   And there could be PICs compatible tags that rely on

    19           self-labeling?

    20           A   Yes.

    21           Q   And there's nothing in your proposal that's inconsistent

    22           with the self-labeling idea that's embodied in PICs?

    23           A   No.

    24           Q   In fact, you're leaving it up to the creative genius of

    25           the Internet to come up with solutions that are consistent
                                                                            95

     1           with minus L18, is that your testimony?

     2           A   Absolutely.

     3           Q   Can I read you -- can I turn to the matter that Mr. Ennis

     4           raised and the Court raised about blocking sites on the

     5           Internet and transition rules.  Is it your testimony -- 

     6           A   And transition --

     7           Q   And transition rules.

     8           A   Rules or costs?

     9           Q   Costs.  I'll stick with transition costs.  What -- would

    10           it be in your view a quicker solution for content creators to

    11           have -- to go through their site even if it's a large site to

    12           narrow down what might be sexually explicit material or

    13           material within the CDA?  Would it be quicker for them to do

    14           that or would it be quicker to rely on third-party rating

    15           services to rate sites on the Internet in a PICs compatible

    16           format, what would happen faster?

    17           A   In terms of labor required, it is much easier for the

    18           creator to have done this than to have the label bureau do

    19           it.  As an example, I could go back to BYU right now and

    20           label the department's entire site as none containing

    21           sexually explicit material.  Mr. Bradner could do the same

    22           for his data site.  Large numbers of universities --

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's cause your data sites deal

    24           with computers and technical things, right?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  Well, right, because -- it's because I
                                                                            96

     1           know what's on the site, but the point is that I was going to

     2           get to is that a label bureau does not know.  They don't have

     3           that prior knowledge that there is nothing there, so they

     4           have to go look.

     5           BY MR. BARON:  

     6           Q   Do you think it will take a long time for a majority of

     7           the sites on the Internet to be rated by a PICs rating

     8           service?

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do you know?  If you know.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  I'm reluctant to characterize the

    11           amount of time it would take all of them.  The caveat there

    12           also being PICs and its availability.  Through the PIC L18 I

    13           feel a little better about, I don't think it would take

    14           anybody more than a couple of months unless they had a

    15           particularly large collection.

    16           BY MR. BARON:  

    17           Q   The Government doesn't control the Internet, correct?

    18           A   That is correct.

    19           Q   And your L18 scheme could not be immediately implemented

    20           in the push of a button, somebody in Washington, to block all

    21           sites on the Internet if minus L18 came out as a consensus

    22           for screening, correct?

    23           A   I know of no way to do that.

    24           Q   You're not relying on the U.S. Government in any fashion

    25           for mandating the minus L18 proposal?
                                                                            97

     1           A   I am not.

     2                    MR. BARON:  I have no further questions.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, would you stay there just for a

     4           minute because it was -- you asked him a question and I think

     5           he didn't get to answer the second half and I thought maybe

     6           that would be appropriate.  Somewhere maybe your second or

     7           third question dealt with costs and you said it wouldn't cost

     8           very much to put in the four -- that it wouldn't cost very

     9           much to put in minus L18 and he answered and you started to

    10           say well, and you said well, to put in the four strokes and

    11           he said no, that wouldn't be very expensive.  And I thought

    12           you started to say in response but to go to the next step and

    13           you went to the four strokes.  Do you recall that colloquy

    14           and I think the question is somebody's got to -- and I

    15           thought you were about to talk about the fact that somebody

    16           will have to decide that this should go to minus L18 and that

    17           there would be some costs associated with that.  Is that

    18           correct?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  I assume that there are always costs

    20           associated with a human judgment, but the technical --

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You started to say the judgment

    22           part.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And that's what was cut off.

    24                    THE WITNESS:  I have not characterized those.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And --
                                                                            98

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Other than what I stated about a pre-

     2           screen that you could do on images or text.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, so we are talking pre-

     4           screening.  And then the judgment cost would be similar,

     5           would it be different in degree from the judgment involved

     6           with PICs whether --

     7                    THE WITNESS:  No, no, the judgment cost is going to

     8           be the same either way.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, thank you. 

    10                    MR. BARON:  Thank you, your Honor.

    11                    (Witness excused.)

<PRE>

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Mr. Coppolino?

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, all right, Mr. Coppolino, Judge

    14           Dalzell has invited you up.

    15                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I'm sorry?

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Didn't you want to -- did you have

    17           anything else for us or --

    18                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I think the only thing that's left

    19           to do today before the hearing concludes is for the

    20           Government to formally move into evidence its exhibits.

    21                    I think this is going to be broken down in two

    22           categories because I think plaintiffs have objections to the

    23           exhibits or some of the exhibits.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.

    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I think that they can be safely
                                                                            99

     1           categorized as two main areas: one is the Howard Schmidt

     2           exhibits of the sexually explicit material.  They may have

     3           objections to some or all of those and I think that that's

     4           one argument, if you will.

     5                    In addition, we have extracted from the various

     6           notebooks we have submitted to the Court over the last two

     7           hearing days other exhibits which we would formally move into

     8           evidence and there would be, I believe, some evidentiary

     9           objections with respect to some of those.

    10                    With respect to that grouping I would ask Ms.

    11           Russotto to present those exhibits and to respond to any

    12           objections that they may have and then deal separately with

    13           any objections to the Howard Schmidt exhibits, or we could

    14           reverse the order, if it please the Court.

    15                    The only other point I would make preliminarily is I

    16           don't know if the Court has those notebooks and if you wanted

    17           to break and get them or whatnot, but that's really all that

    18           has to be done before the hearing can conclude.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do plaintiffs know now which you're

    20           going to offer into evidence so that you have locked horns

    21           already on those?

    22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes, I believe so.  So we could

    23           start with the non Howard Schmidt exhibits, if you'd like.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I didn't bring any exhibits down at

    25           all.
                                                                           100

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, I've got the books here.

     2                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Or we could start -- whichever.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, why don't we just do it

     4           before lunch?  Is that all right with you, Stewart?

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes.

     6                    (Discussion off the record.)

     7                    MR. BARON:  Excuse me, your Honor, could Dr. Olsen

     8           be excused?

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, I think so, unless he wants to

    10           rule on the exhibits.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Thank you very much, Dr. Olsen.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Have a good trip back.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We want to ask counsel a question

    15           as to what difference it's going to make for the purposes of

    16           our decisionmaking?  In other words, if the Government has

    17           proffered the exhibits and we were to rule that some were not

    18           relevant or appropriate, they would still have to go into the

    19           record as proffered.  And we're not dealing with a jury, so

    20           why don't we let it -- why would the plaintiffs want to

    21           object to letting anything in for this purpose?

    22                    MS. HEINS:  Thank you, your Honor, Marjorie Heins

    23           for the ACLU plaintiffs.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Can you be heard on the -- can she

    25           be heard on the tape?
                                                                           101

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, go ahead.

     3                    MS. HEINS:  A few -- well, to start with, the Court

     4           should have our objections to the exhibits that we thought

     5           the Government was proffering at a time before they narrowed

     6           the field.

     7                    The Government has not even moved the introduction

     8           of some of those which are clearly hearsay or otherwise

     9           inappropriate, so as to those --

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, well, they're now moving,

    11           yeah.

    12                    MS. HEINS:  You may have them but they're -- we are

    13           agreed they are not part of any record to be considered in

    14           connection with the preliminary injunction motion.

    15                    As to the ones we still dispute, our main objections

    16           fall into two categories: one is hearsay and that would

    17           include, for example, the Meese Commission report.  It's

    18           offered for the truth of the assertions in there.  We

    19           vigorously dispute the truth of those assertions.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But if you want to write your

    21           objections, unless you wanted to stand up and say that and we

    22           have your objections and we have the -- I don't see how --

    23           you agree that nothing that we could do would mean that these

    24           exhibits don't get into the record, one way or the other.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  They're not going to be purged from
                                                                           102

     1           the record.

     2                    MS. HEINS:  Well, they may be in the record but we

     3           would like an opportunity clearly to state our hearsay

     4           objections to some of them and, by the way, as to some of

     5           them, the Government does not dispute that they are not

     6           admissible for the truth of any assertions there.  And that

     7           would be the other category of things like the Internet

     8           Yellow Pages.  I think we're agreed that as to those, they

     9           are relevant only for purposes of showing the Court that

    10           there are books out there that purport to list sex.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But that's exactly the point, Ms.

    12           Heins, is that the Court surely knows that the statements in

    13           the Meese report are hearsay, okay?  I mean we really know

    14           what that is, we know it when we see it.

    15                    (Laughter.)

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And that being the case, for the

    17           life of me I just don't understand what your concern is.  We

    18           know to go through this there are hundreds of exhibits here. 

    19           Do you really want us to go through them one by one now?

    20                    MS. HEINS:  No.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  As though there were a jury here?

    22                    MS. HEINS:  No, Judge Dalzell.  And in fact the

    23           areas of dispute are fairly small at this point.  As long as

    24           we are all agreed that the Meese Commission is hearsay and

    25           none of the assertions in it can be considered for their
                                                                           103

     1           truth, then the fact that it is physically a piece of paper

     2           in your chambers is irrelevant.  But I think that agreement

     3           has to be quite clear.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  In the record.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's in the record, it's in the

     6           record.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And it would be in the record one

     8           way or the other.  Remember, this is a preliminary injunction

     9           hearing and for purposes of the preliminary injunction

    10           hearing we just find it difficult to understand why we would

    11           have to move, you know, strike any of this.

    12                    MS. HEINS:  Well, it may be in the record but--

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But we could accept it as subject

    14           to your objections.

    15                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  There's a lot of exhibits,

    16           there's a lot of exhibits you object to here.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But it does seem to me that from an

    18           appellate court standpoint, I always want to see what was

    19           proffered and it might be error not to have accepted some

    20           evidence or not, so it's got to be there.

    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yeah, it seems to me you could

    22           continue to argue in your briefs why we should not consider

    23           certain exhibits in arriving at our decision, but all that we

    24           think is that the exhibits ought to be part of the record in

    25           any event for review by another court.
                                                                           104

     1                    MS. HEINS:  Well, they may be part of the record but

     2           I do think we are entitled to a ruling or an agreement that

     3           certain of them either are hearsay and therefore not to be

     4           considered for any assertions that are in them or, in the

     5           case of the Internet Yellow Pages, we are objecting simply

     6           because, number one, the selected excerpts that the

     7           Government has put in are obsolete, there is a new edition

     8           and, number two, they have been very selective.  And we would

     9           simply propose --

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We are confident that you will so

    11           argue in your post trial.  I think that what we're going to

    12           do, we don't mean to deprive any of you of your 15 minutes in

    13           the sun, you've had more than that, we will do as we have

    14           done with all of the witnesses objections, we will accept the

    15           exhibits for what they are worth.  You can argue that they

    16           are worth nothing or they can argue that they are worth a

    17           great deal, but we see no reason after this lengthy

    18           preliminary injunction hearing with very lengthy exhibits and

    19           having seen the displays and everything else, we see no

    20           reason to go through seriatim these exhibits at this time.

    21                    MS. HEINS:  Well, again, just to make the record

    22           clear--

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.

    24                    MS. HEINS:  -- we have a very small number of

    25           disputes, we are not suggesting --
                                                                           105

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right.

     2                    MS. HEINS:  -- that the Court engage in any such

     3           burdensome task, as to the Internet Yellow Pages, as you can

     4           see, we have gone to the effort of buying the Court the

     5           entire Internet Yellow Pages.  We simply think it is improper

     6           for the Government to proffer obsolete copies of certain

     7           selected portions.  And they're heavy, we didn't bring one

     8           for each.  If I may  just --

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, Mr. Coppolino?

    10                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, she's made her argument three

    11           times and you've responded three times and I think the points

    12           are clear on both sides now.

    13                    MS. HEINS:  Well, if I may --

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, let her make it for the

    15           record.

    16                    MS. HEINS:  -- please finish my sentence.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, go ahead.  I mean everybody

    18           has been really very cooperative up till now so we're going

    19           to continue in that vein.  Continue.

    20                    MS. HEINS:  I will try to be extremely brief.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    22                    MS. HEINS:  We simply think it is more appropriate

    23           for the Court to be aware that there are many books that call

    24           themselves the Internet Yellow Pages, we have brought two. 

    25           We will offer them.  We hope that the Court could share one
                                                                           106

     1           as opposed to taking all three.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, yes, we're in the same building

     3           purposefully, we are in the same building.

     4                    MS. HEINS:  I think that's more appropriate, these

     5           are the current editions, again not offered for the truth of

     6           the assertions in them.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Are those the volumes right in front

     8           of you there?

     9                    MS. HEINS:  These are two different books purporting

    10           to call themselves the Internet Yellow Pages.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It looks to me like the Rules of

    12           Civil Procedure on top.

    13                    MS. HEINS:  That you don't get. 

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

    15                    (Laughter.)

    16                    MS. HEINS:  We also, another exhibit they have

    17           offered--

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Having helped to draft them, I can

    19           assure that they do not fall within the --

    20                    (Laughter.)

    21                    MS. KAPPLER:  Your Honor, if I may make a

    22           suggestion?

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, let her finish.

    24                    MS. KAPPLER:  I'm sorry.

    25                    MS. HEINS:  Another exhibit they have proffered is a
                                                                           107

     1           selected portion of a book called Net.Sex.  I could only find

     2           one of these in four New York book stores that I tried

     3           yesterday, but again we think the entire book should be

     4           considered by the Court and not just the section that the

     5           Justice Department has --

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, now, wait a minute.  Mr. --

     7           are you finished?

     8                    MS. HEINS:  -- proffered and since I only have one,

     9           what I would suggest in this case is to give us an

    10           opportunity to go back to the office, Xerox it, the entire

    11           thing -- it's short unlike these -- and submit it to the

    12           Court afterwards.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, what we have right now is we

    14           have the Government having gotten up and offered, proffered

    15           into evidence, asked us to admit the Government's exhibits

    16           into evidence.  We have your objections.  If you want to

    17           proffer other things in purview of rebuttal, fine, but hold

    18           on, let's deal with what is in front of us at the moment.

    19                    Do you have anything that you want to add as

    20           objections to what the Government has proffered?

    21                    MS. KAPPLER:  Yes, your Honor, and two points I'd

    22           like to make.  This is Ann Kappler for the ALA plaintiffs.

    23                    First, just a suggestion for the Court's benefit, I

    24           think it might be helpful if we submitted a narrowly tailored

    25           essentially restatement of our objections because there are
                                                                           108

     1           now different documents that are being submitted.  They have

     2           one piece of paper that just has the ones on which we object

     3           to.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We absolutely will allow the

     5           plaintiffs, having cut you off somewhat in oral argument, we

     6           will certainly allow you to submit written objections to any

     7           of the exhibits proffered by the Government.

     8                    MS. KAPPLER:  Thank you, your Honor.  I have one--

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay?  So that the record will be

    10           clear.  Yes?

    11                    MS. KAPPLER:  Excuse me, I have one second point and

    12           that is this morning we were handed a new document which I

    13           think is of a very different ilk and that is a second

    14           declaration of Howard Schmidt.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now that's a separate thing.  Let's

    16           hold that out.  We don't know, at the moment we're talking

    17           about exhibits.

    18                    MS. KAPPLER:  Well, they are submitting this as an

    19           exhibit, I mean that's how they denominate it, as an exhibit.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, we are dealing at the moment

    21           not with declarations, we're going to deal with declaration

    22           later.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's a separate issue, surely.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.  So we agree that that's a

    25           separate issue. 
                                                                           109

     1                    MS. HEINS:  I have one other point, if I may.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.

     3                    MS. HEINS:  With respect to some of the exhibits

     4           that have been proffered and these are in fact exhibits that

     5           in Mr. Schmidt's original affidavit he attempted to

     6           authenticate.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, Mr. Schmidt is a -- is a

     8           separate -- Mr. Schmidt's documents I think are a separate

     9           category.  Right now we're dealing with all of the other

    10           exhibits separate from Mr. Schmidt.

    11                    MS. HEINS:  The reason I raised it now is these were

    12           exhibits that were not in Mr. Coppolino's book, but these

    13           were exhibits that were in the original three sets of

    14           Government cross-examination exhibits.  We were not given

    15           notice that these were exhibits Mr. Schmidt had downloaded

    16           and printed out, they were not produced to us at the

    17           deposition as part of the materials that the Government was

    18           telling us would be in what turned out to be the Coppolino

    19           book.  Instead they were cross-examination exhibits with no

    20           indication of where they came from or who downloaded them.

    21                    Schmidt in his declaration in Paragraph 39 purported

    22           to authenticate them in very vague terms.  We would object to

    23           their going in.  These again are cross-examination exhibits

    24           not in the Schmidt book, we would object to their going in,

    25           they're not authenticated.
                                                                           110

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Mr. Coppolino?

     2                    MR. COPPOLINO:  First of all, can we change the name

     3           of the book, your Honor?

     4                    (Laughter.)

     5                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, let me just step back to

     6           indicate that -- a couple of things.  First of all, I have a

     7           pleading type document here which lists all of the exhibits

     8           that we would offer into evidence from all of the materials

     9           we have submitted over the past two weeks except for

    10           declarations and I would -- that would give the Court and it

    11           would give, as to the plaintiffs, we'd give you a full list.

    12                    Now, as I understand what the Court's been

    13           indicating then the weight of these exhibits, whatever

    14           evidentiary objections there are to them or our response to

    15           them would be handled in the briefing process.

    16                    In other words, if they consider a particular

    17           exhibit to be hearsay we could identify our response to that

    18           in the brief.  We're prepared to argue every one of their

    19           objections right now, the hearsay objections, whatever they

    20           might be, or any other concern.

    21                    If the Court prefers, however, we could simply deal

    22           with that in the -- in the brief.  If they think it's

    23           hearsay, if we think we've got a hearsay objection we could

    24           identify it.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  One second.
                                                                           111

     1                    (Discussion off the record.)

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think what the Court would like

     3           to do is that you -- all of these arguments can be made in

     4           connection with your post-trial submission, and you can now

     5           or later submit what you want, you can respond to it in

     6           writing.  We will have an opportunity to actually see the

     7           documents and see the -- you can then proffer your rebuttal

     8           exhibits if you want.  And on the day that your -- well, and

     9           in your writings, when you submit it with your post-trial

    10           submissions, you can include this separately or encompassed

    11           within it, and the Court will rule.  Okay?

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  That sounds fine, your Honor.  We

    13           would also --

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is that all right?

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  As to everything.

    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  If it would assist the Court, we

    17           could also do just a separate submission on evidentiary --

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You could.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You could, I think that would make

    20           sense.

    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  That makes a lot of sense.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That would clarify it.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And do that at the time of the post-

    24           trial briefing.

    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Very well.
                                                                           112

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That makes a lot of sense, Mr.

     2           Coppolino.

     3                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, I won't read the document, but

     4           I will -- we will submit it and file it.  The plaintiffs have

     5           it, it lists all of the things we would proffer, so rather

     6           than reading it, it's here in writing.  I would indicate it

     7           does include the Schmidt exhibits, as well as this additional

     8           item that Ms. Kappler referred to -- did the Court want to

     9           deal with that in the same manner or did it want to hear --

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, here's what I think you ought

    11           to do is I would like you all, if possible, I'm sure my

    12           colleagues will agree, in the next day or two to sit down and

    13           try to narrow the areas of dispute, okay?  Bearing in mind

    14           what we have said to you not once, not twice, but many times

    15           throughout the five days of hearing here, what we're doing,

    16           and to take an intensely practical approach.  But if each

    17           side believes that there is a narrow universe of documents as

    18           to which admissibility is a truly significant issue and you

    19           can't agree on it then at the time of the post-trial

    20           submissions you can identify those exhibits for us, all

    21           right?  Does that make sense?

    22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I think it does and I --

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is that all right with you,

    24           Colleagues?

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, yes --
                                                                           113

     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, that's fine.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- fine.

     3                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes, it does make sense and we have

     4           I think tried to do that... we have narrowed it down to about

     5           a dozen already.

     6                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Maybe you can further narrow it

     7           down.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, what about the Schmidt

     9           declaration?

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  There's a new declaration?

    11                    MS. KAPPLER:  Yes, your Honor.

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No.  Could I explain that?

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah, let's hear Mr. Coppolino

    14           first.

    15                    MR. COPPOLINO:  We were going to of course proffer

    16           the Schmidt -- all of the Schmidt exhibits, the one

    17           additional item which I was going to offer to the Court was

    18           in the course of Mr. Schmidt's cross-examination and

    19           questioning by the Court and redirect by me he went into an

    20           issue which was not present in his direct testimony

    21           concerning a key-word search, I think it was women pictures

    22           with Surfwatch running.  The issue came up as to whether or

    23           not Surfwatch would block sexually-explicit sites, and we

    24           described the tests he undertook by identifying specific

    25           sites.  Then under questioning he went into an issue of would
                                                                           114

     1           sites be identified through a key-word search and he

     2           specifically talked about women pictures.  He also indicated

     3           that he had downloaded that particular result.  What I was

     4           going to offer to the Court was that specific download with

     5           the declaration, which only authenticates it and says that I

     6           did it and this is what I did, and that's all that this is. 

     7           Now, I realize it is a new exhibit, it is --

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It is very problematic also.

     9                    MR. COPPOLINO:  It is not a part of the direct

    10           testimony, because that was not part of his direct testimony, 

    11           the door onto this subject was opened if you will on the

    12           cross-examination.  Now, if the Court considers it

    13           prejudicial we don't have to offer it.  He referred to it and

    14           I thought that the Court might want to see it.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do you object?

    16                    MS. KAPPLER:  Yes, your Honor.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, we sustain the objection.  I

    18           do --

    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  That only leaves the rest of the

    20           Schmidt notebook then to talk about, if there is anything to

    21           talk about.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, you're going to do the same

    23           thing with the rest of the Schmidt notebook as you do with

    24           all of the other exhibits and they will father objections,

    25           and they may follow to all of the material, they may want to
                                                                           115

     1           object to part of it --

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But first you're going to meet and

     3           try to resolve as much as possible.

     4                    MS. HEINS:  Would it be appropriate at this point to

     5           proffer the Internet yellow pages?

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, I think you should proffer

     7           them, except there's no wit -- is there anybody who --

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, there could be a stipulation

     9           though.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Will you stipulate to the Internet

    11           yellow pages?

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  We have no objection if they want to

    13           submit the whole volume.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Admitted.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And you can take it back --

    17                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I'd like to know what volume it is.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- and bring it back.  I don't know

    19           what --

    20                    MS. HEINS:  I'd rather not have to take it back --

    21                    (Laughter.)

    22                    MS. HEINS:  -- so I'd rather give it to you now. 

    23           And let me just point out that one of --

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Take it up to Room 2609.

    25                    MS. HEINS:  -- one of them has a CD-Rom, which
                                                                           116

     1           purports to be a Web Browser; I haven't tried it, but --

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I don't know how one would do --

     3           use it, so --

     4                    MS. HEINS:  -- it comes --

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- this is not -- well, okay.  

     6                    Is that it?  Okay.  I want to thank -- yes, you're

     7           going to all see Judge Dalzell about the scheduling in 15

     8           minutes, but -- Mr. Ennis?

     9                    MR. ENNIS:  I believe that's the close of the

    10           Government's case, the Government has no further witnesses?

    11                    MR. COPPOLINO:  The Government rests.

    12                    MR. ENNIS:  We appreciate that the Court gave us the

    13           opportunity to call rebuttal witnesses for the plaintiffs,

    14           but as the Court has been informed we have waived calling any

    15           live rebuttal witnesses.  The only thing left that I am aware

    16           of for plaintiffs is we are -- we have filed these

    17           supplemental declarations of the non-trial affiants and that

    18           has been set aside for separate briefing.  I simply wanted to

    19           remind the Court that we will be relying on those

    20           supplemental declarations as well.

    21                    MR. COPPOLINO:  We are aware that they filed it and

    22           Judge Dalzell has allowed us an opportunity to object to that

    23           and he has given us dates for that, and that's what we'll be

    24           doing.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I do want to thank -- I think on
                                                                           117

     1           behalf of the entire Court, we do want to thank counsel for

     2           the expeditious manner in which they have handled this very

     3           lengthy, very long, very complex technologically and

     4           otherwise record.  I think that the cooperation is a credit

     5           to you as members of the profession and the Court is very

     6           grateful to all of you, and we will try to reciprocate.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And I'll see you in 15 minutes.

     8                    (Court adjourned at 12:20 o'clock p.m.)

     1                    (The following occurred in open court at 9:38

     2           o'clock a.m.:)

     3                    CLERK OF COURT KUNZ:  Oyez, oyez, oyez, all persons

     4           having any matters to present before the Honorable Delores K.

     5           Sloviter, Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals

     6           for the Third Circuit; and the Honorable Ronald L. Buckwalter

     7           and the Honorable Stuart Dalzell, Judges of the United States

     8           District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, may

     9           be present and appear and they shall be heard.  God save the

    10           United States and this Honorable Court.  Court is now in

    11           session, please be seated.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Good morning.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Good morning, everyone.

    14                    ALL COUNSEL:  Good morning, your Honors.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We will resume in ACLU v. Reno, et

    16           al.  I believe that we're to begin with the Government's

    17           case?

    18                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Good morning, your Honor.  At this

    19           time the Government calls Howard Schmidt.

    20                    HOWARD SCHMIDT, Defendants' Witness, Sworn.

    21                    THE COURT CLERK:  Thank you, please be seated. 

    22           Please state and spell your name.

    23                    THE WITNESS:  My name is Howard A. Schmidt, 

    24           S-c-h-m-i-d-t, first name is H-o-w-a-r-d.

    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Good morning, your Honor.  For the

                                                                             4

     1           record, I will identify myself again as Anthony Coppolino

     2           with the Justice Department.  Your Honor, at this time I

     3           offer into evidence the direct testimony/declaration of

     4           Howard Schmidt and all of the exhibits that are attached

     5           thereto, which has been provided to the Court.  Thank you.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, I think that they're having an

     7           offer of proof on that -- he's offering into evidence --

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Are you offering the exhibits right

     9           now?

    10                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, I had planned to because I

    11           thought he might refer to them initially in his

    12           demonstration.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, they're for identification

    14           right now.

    15                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Okay.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay?

    17                    MS. HEINS:  We have an objection, your Honor.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right, we understand.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Let's hear it.

    20                    MS. HEINS:  Marjorie Heins for the ACLU plaintiffs.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You better come before the...

    22                    MS. HEINS:  Marjorie Heins for the ACLU plaintiffs. 

    23           We object to the introduction into evidence of Mr. Schmidt's

    24           declaration to the extent he purports to be an expert in any

    25           of the five separate subject-matter areas that are referenced

                                                                             5

     1           on Page 4, Paragraph 5 of the declaration.  

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, do you want to do voir dire on

     3           that?

     4                    (Discussion held off the record.)

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, the Court has considered it and

     6           we believe that he is as much an expert in this as the

     7           plaintiffs' witnesses were on the matters which they were

     8           called.  We're going to check each ruling on this -- do you

     9           agree with that?

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, we agree with that, sure.

    11                    MS. HEINS:  If I can just state briefly for the

    12           record, Mr. Schmidt is undoubtedly an expert in computer

    13           forensics and investigatory techniques, law enforcement

    14           investigatory techniques connected with computers.  However,

    15           the five subject-matter areas on which he purports to be an

    16           expert are not within his area of expertise.  To start from

    17           the top, since he is such an expert -- he can certainly

    18           testify as to what he did on the computer and the Court can

    19           take into consideration and make its own judgment whether

    20           it's easy or difficult to access the materials that Mr.

    21           Schmidt accessed, but since he is such a computer expert we

    22           don't think he's really in a position to testify as to how

    23           easy it would be for a child to access these materials,

    24           that's fact --

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, we're not going to have --

                                                                             6

     1                    MS. HEINS:  -- not opinion.  I'm sorry.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- we're not going to have a child

     3           up here testifying and we have been very lax with all of the

     4           parties with respect to expertise, we have said throughout

     5           that we will take the witness and the witness' expertise for

     6           whatever it's worth to us and we see no reason to treat one

     7           party differently than another for this purpose.  That of

     8           course is not the same as saying that any of the material is

     9           or isn't relevant, an entirely different issue.

    10                    MS. HEINS:  I understand.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So, I believe that the panel

    12           believes that for this purpose we will accept the witness as

    13           an expert to the extent and for what it's worth.

    14                    MS. HEINS:  I understand, but if I just may briefly

    15           complete my statement?  I think each witness is different,

    16           the expertise of each witness is different and this witness'

    17           expertise does not go to any of the subject-matter areas that

    18           he describes on Page 4.  And just briefly to conclude that,

    19           his opinions as to the pervasiveness or the -- what

    20           percentage or what quantity of sexually-explicit or

    21           pornographic material is available, again, we don't think

    22           that's a matter that he has expertise in; he's not a

    23           sociologist of the Internet, he has no studies, it's simply

    24           impressionistic.  And finally, with respect to his claims of

    25           expertise as to the ability of parents to supervise their

                                                                             7

     1           children using computers or the availability or feasibility

     2           of so-called adult identification and password systems, as to

     3           the first he is not expert or knowledgeable in particular in

     4           parent-child relationships, he has no knowledge of how many

     5           households with children have computers, how many children

     6           use them, all he has told us at his deposition is some

     7           anecdotes about parents expressing concerns; and with respect

     8           to the adult-identification ideas, his testimony has been

     9           quite clear and I think the Government will agree, he has

    10           absolutely no expertise in that area.  His total knowledge of

    11           the adult password systems is based on what he has read on

    12           Web screens, which the Court can make judgments about as well

    13           as he.  

    14                    So, we don't object to his factual testimony except

    15           to the extent we have already set forth in our motion in

    16           limine, but with respect to expert opinions we simply don't

    17           think that his expertise corresponds to what he is claiming.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  The panel, we will

    19           accept it for what it's worth.

    20                    MS. HEINS:  Thank you.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.

    22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, I'm not going to respond

    23           on that point since I think you have ruled.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, because we've ruled.

    25                    (Laughter.)

                                                                             8

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You won the argument.

     2                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I just -- I neglect --

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You want to say that we're really

     4           right?

     5                    (Laughter.)

     6                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I neglected to indicate that, as we

     7           had conferred with Judge Dalzell earlier in the week, the

     8           witness will be presenting a brief demonstration on -- of

     9           various sources and sites on the Internet.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.  Well, are you going to tell

    11           us before you put it -- all right.  Well, we'll take this

    12           testimony slowly, so that we understand what it is.  There is

    13           some concern by some members of the panel at least as to the

    14           relevance of some of this material, but let's proceed and

    15           we'll see.

    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Thank you.

    17                                 DIRECT EXAMINATION

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Good morning, your Honors.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Good morning.

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Am I okay on the microphone?

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes.

    22                    THE WITNESS:  What I'd like to do, as Mr. Coppolino

    23           pointed --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Wait a minute, has a question been

    25           asked to you?  I mean, I think -- is there --

                                                                             9

     1                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I'm sorry --

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, he's going to do a

     3           demonstration and it was going to be done in narrative form.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, that's all right, but I

     5           didn't know that he had been asked to start.  Okay, go ahead,

     6           Mr. Schmidt.

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We can't see you on the monitors, I

     9           certainly can't.  Go ahead.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  As Mr. Coppolino stated, what I'd like

    11           to do is give you a demonstration to show you some of the

    12           features of the Internet and some of the workings of the

    13           Internet, as stated before.  What I'm going to use is the

    14           Netscape Web Browser as kind of the single tool to do the

    15           demonstration, as I believe you have seen before during

    16           previous testimony.  The Netscape Web Browser when first

    17           activated by double clicking on a particular icon, you have

    18           the ability to determine what home page or what Web site it

    19           initially goes to upon startup.  In this case I have selected

    20           through one of the options the Web site of Netscape

    21           Corporation, which is the manufacturer of this particular

    22           piece of software that's in popular use today.  As you can

    23           see by the screen in front of you, there's some graphics

    24           involved and as I move the mouse pointer across the screen,

    25           as it changes from a pointer into a hand, this indicates to

                                                                            10

     1           me that there is some sort of a link that I can select by

     2           clicking the mouse button and go to another location.  Across

     3           the bottom of this top graphic there's items such as

     4           exploring the Net, companies and products, general store, et

     5           cetera, as I move across you can see I could select any one

     6           of those areas to determine which part of the Web page and

     7           which link I want to go to from here.  Additionally, there

     8           are some other menu selections that are built in this

     9           particular area, such as what's new, what's cool, handbook,

    10           Net search, Net directory, which give you some of the same

    11           capabilities, but instead of looking through the document

    12           itself you can select it as you would from a menu position.

    13                    One of the first ones I'd like to demonstrate is the

    14           Net search capability.  By putting my mouse pointer over the

    15           word Net search, I click it once, and as you'll notice

    16           there's a red, sort of a stop-sign-looking icon appear up

    17           here, which indicates that it's currently going out to

    18           retrieve a document from a server somewhere.  As the document

    19           becomes displayed on the screen you see it is partially is

    20           drawn, and it goes back to the server and retrieves bits and

    21           pieces of the document to draw the screen in its total

    22           format.

    23                    Now, as we have the screen in front of us, you can

    24           see once again by moving the cursor, I can select certain

    25           aspects of it.  From previous testimony I believe there was

                                                                            11

     1           discussion about some of the search routines, such as Lykos,

     2           Magellan, Yahoo, Infoseek, these are all here, these are

     3           multiple-search engines that I could select from this

     4           particular position in the menu.  Also, if your Honors will

     5           notice, on the right-hand side of the screen there is an up

     6           arrow and a down arrow down at the bottom, which is referred

     7           to as the elevator bar.  There is more text or more substance

     8           below what's currently on the screen, so by scrolling down,

     9           by clicking on the down arrow on the right-hand side you'll

    10           see in addition to the links that I can select by moving the

    11           cursor around, I also can select by a narrative certain

    12           search engines that are available here.  For example, the

    13           first one that comes up is a search engine, which is part of

    14           the Lykos engine called A to Z.  This is similar to some of

    15           the other search engines we have seen and what I'd like to do

    16           at this point is select that one.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Why do you take that one, from the

    18           -- because it says from the "Best Kid's Page," what is there

    19           about that one?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  This one has a lot of different

    21           subject categories that you could search from by

    22           subcategories, as I'll be demonstrating to the Court in just

    23           a moment.  The other ones would do similar things, your

    24           Honor, as it just so happened that one was the first one that

    25           was available under that particular search routine -- as well

                                                                            12

     1           as I have prepared this demonstration, that's the one that I

     2           would use in the process of doing that.

     3                    As you can see, once again, as I move the mouse

     4           cursor around I have the ability to select particular images

     5           that might click and link to me another site.  I also have in

     6           this box here, which we will demonstrate in a little bit,

     7           where I could click in there and type in a particular phrase

     8           or some search routine that I would like to use, or I have

     9           the broader spectrum of different types of subjects down here

    10           that one might be interested in.  

    11                    Now, obviously since we're in a Court, in a Federal

    12           Court, Government would be of interest I believe to most of

    13           the members here, and I'd like to select at this time the

    14           Government as a subcategory.  At this point it went out, read

    15           some information off of the server in which this information

    16           is actually stored, and came back, identified that I have

    17           selected Government as the primary category, here are some

    18           subcategories under the Government phase, which are also

    19           listed in the center portion of the screen.  Over here, since

    20           we're in a court of law, I would like to select at this time

    21           law, which may be of interest to us as well.  And it

    22           immediately goes out and shows me that I'm under the category

    23           of Government, subcategory of law, and now the screen changes

    24           a little bit in composition from what we saw before.  As I'm

    25           slowing clicking it up for the Court to be able to see, I now

                                                                            13

     1           have an alphabet out here that I could select and jump to any

     2           particular character beginning -- for example, if I selected

     3           the letter P, it might start with some legal aspects with the

     4           letter P in the first character.  I also could search, as I

     5           started to do on the right-hand side by clicking down,

     6           specific text-related things, as I move the cursor down here

     7           it changes to a hand, I could click and go to advertising

     8           law, a firm based in Washington, D.C., et cetera, as I go

     9           down those links A through Z as well.

    10                    In this case I want to, with the Court's permission,

    11           move back over to -- as I mentioned earlier, to the box where

    12           it says "find."  By clicking my mouse and moving into there,

    13           you notice it changes from a pointer to sort of an iron-bar-

    14           looking icon.  The cursor is now flashing in there and since,

    15           once again, we are in a Federal Court I would like to type in

    16           Federal Courts.  And instead of perusing by viewing each one

    17           of the narratives in there I can just tell it by clicking on

    18           the words "go get it" to go out to a site and give me

    19           anything related to Federal Courts.  As the Court can see,

    20           once again we've come back with the search results, the A to

    21           Z search.  Under the words of Federal Court it says that 152

    22           documents were located containing the words federal,

    23           federally or courts.  

    24                    The first one we could scroll down and see a number

    25           of the selections we have here... and at any time, if the

                                                                            14

     1           Court would like, please, I would be more than happy to stop

     2           as well.  And for the purpose of the demonstration I have

     3           selected the Federal Judicial Center, which I have reviewed

     4           and thought might contain some interest -- some items of

     5           interest for the Court.  Once again I move to that particular

     6           link, click one time, it goes back out to that particular

     7           computer system, retrieves that information, retrieves the

     8           graphics, retrieves some text and basically repaints the

     9           screen on our monitor for us to see.  Down here, as the Court

    10           has already seen a few times, we have links, as I move across

    11           these particular links it changes to a hand, I could go to

    12           them.  Either that or I could select one of the graphic

    13           images here and go to one of the areas that are listed about

    14           the FJC publications, other Worldwide Web servers or

    15           telephone directory.

    16                    Through the preparation of this demonstration I went

    17           to the publication, which I would like to do at this time. 

    18           And at this juncture it brings me a list of different

    19           publications from the Federal Judicial Center publications,

    20           and it talks about their formats and different publications

    21           that are available for one to look through.  Clicking down

    22           through some of them you can see some of them address the

    23           areas of appellate courts, bankruptcy courts, civil

    24           litigation, and some of the subdocuments involved in those

    25           categories that are available for one to go out and link to. 

                                                                            15

     1           In this case I'll select, if it's okay with the Court,

     2           stalking, the increase -- the rate of Federal civil appeals,

     3           I'll link to that particular document.  Now, it's going out

     4           and it's retrieving that information and making it available

     5           for my review.  And it gives a brief narrative of what the

     6           document is about, and it says a 32-page report, et cetera. 

     7           And it also gives me the option, if you'll notice just

     8           underneath the paragraph of text here, it says, "download a

     9           PDF version of this document," which is kind of a universal

    10           formatting language.  We can actually go to the site,

    11           retrieve the actual document itself and transfer it from

    12           where it's located at the Federal Judicial Center to our

    13           computer here for later review, and all we would have to do

    14           is one click and bring that document back.

    15                    At this time, your Honor, what I'd like to do is go

    16           back to some of the previous pages we have and there's a

    17           couple ways I can do that.  I believe you saw an earlier

    18           demonstration, there's what appears to be like a VCR button

    19           up here in the upper left-hand corner, as the mouse cursor

    20           sits over it the word "back" appears, that means I can click

    21           and go back through previous pages in the sequence in which I

    22           have viewed the pages or the user has viewed the pages.  I

    23           can also, if I didn't want to scroll back or go back through

    24           a number of pages, go up to this menu selection where it

    25           says, "go," and I can then see the pages that I have selected

                                                                            16

     1           previously, as I move the mouse pointer across them it

     2           highlights those.  So, I can go back to a specific page in

     3           particular and go back and find a document that I reviewed

     4           earlier without clicking two, three, four times to get back

     5           to the starting point.

     6                    Okay, at this point I'd like to go back to the A to

     7           Z home page and I click that, it brought us back to there. 

     8           One of the other areas that I have prepared for the

     9           demonstration was the area I have selected under arts and

    10           leisure.  Once again, as I did with the Government, I go over

    11           to that particular menu selection, click once on the mouse...

    12           noticing the Court's attention to -- entertainment/leisure

    13           being the menu selection.  Once again, it has a number of

    14           different subcategories that one might select by a click of a

    15           mouse to get certain areas of information that might be of

    16           interest to them.   Once again, for this particular

    17           demonstration I have selected the subcategory of travel, I

    18           click on travel.  And as we have seen in the previous screens

    19           for the courts and for the Government and law we have the

    20           narrative by -- in alphabetical order, we can also select by

    21           the alphabet up here.  And in this case what I'd like to do

    22           is select the letter P for Philadelphia, which is the town

    23           that I grew up in.  Using the right mouse I can go down and

    24           click, an area of interest would be Philadelphia history.  As

    25           you can see I move over to that link of Philadelphia history,

                                                                            17

     1           click once with the mouse and it clicks to -- or it's in the

     2           process of retrieving information from a Website known as

     3           libertynet.org, and I can tell that because up in the open

     4           blank space up here it says the http information, Worldwide

     5           Web, libertynet.org is the name of the computer system, which

     6           is information stored, and it's stored in a subfile or a

     7           subdirectory as it were IHA.  The screen has now been redrawn

     8           with the information that I have requested to be transferred

     9           to my display here and, once again, I can move across and

    10           click on certain areas such as historic mile, Betsy Ross,

    11           Valley Forge, places to eat, various nightlife, et cetera. 

    12           As the Court can see as I move across, all of these

    13           particular images on here would link me to another location

    14           on a computer server that may contain some information I

    15           might be interested in.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Does the location -- is the

    17           location shown throughout?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, it is, your Honor.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Always?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  It will show in the link, if

    21           you'll notice in the lower left-hand corner, which may be

    22           difficult, I know even with my glasses --

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, we can see it.

    24                    THE WITNESS:  -- it's relatively small text, but as

    25           I move from one of the icons to another down in the lower

                                                                            18

     1           left-hand corner it points to the link in text format that

     2           I'm over -- that my hand is over now on the screen.  For

     3           example, this one says philfood.html, it's still at the same

     4           domain, libertynet.org, even though it would not have to

     5           necessarily be stored on that same domain, and it's under

     6           that same filing cabinet or that same subdirectory, IHA,

     7           except this document is called philfood.html.  I can move

     8           over here to nightlife and it says philnight.html, which is

     9           the same as just -- almost similar to a word processing

    10           document by naming a word processing document differently for

    11           different things that you might have in that document.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And what is always the relationship

    13           between the location showing up on the left-hand top and at

    14           the bottom?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  The left-hand top is the current site

    16           that we're viewing, the current Webpage that we're viewing at

    17           this time, the bottom is the one that that particular item,

    18           in this case I currently have it over nightlife, that's -- if

    19           I were to click that I would link to this particular site as

    20           it's indicated in the lower left-hand corner.  Once

    21           successfully accomplishing that link, that particular name

    22           that is currently in the lower left would replace what's

    23           currently in the upper left, so that would indicate that I'm

    24           now at that site as well.  And if the Court like I'll

    25           demonstrate that as --

                                                                            19

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, that's all right -- is that all

     2           right with you?

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's all right.

     4                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  That's all right.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But who decides, is there some way

     6           that the... I'm not sure I know the right word... whoever is

     7           responsible for naming this, is that organization or entity

     8           able to name it in any way or to put something in that name

     9           that will designate it in one way or the other?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct, your Honor.  This,

    11           just like any word-processing document that one of us may

    12           generate, we can choose to name it any name that we like in

    13           with the normal naming conventions of that particular

    14           computer system.  For example, in the Unix environment, which

    15           a lot of this data is stored on, you could have a rather

    16           lengthy name and a very descriptive name as to what that

    17           particular document would be,

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But can you add a header for --

    19           which is what you might call it in regular word processing,

    20           for any material or group of material as you choose?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor, and I'll give you

    22           that in a two-part answer, if I may.  For example, if you'll

    23           notice in the name up here in the open box where it says IHA,

    24           that is a subdirectory equivalent for example, say, to a file

    25           drawer within a file cabinet.  That can be named anything we

                                                                            20

     1           want, for example, it just could have easily been named

     2           history instead of IHA, we can name that and identify

     3           anything related to this particular series of documents would

     4           be stored in that particular file drawer.

     5                    Accordingly, on the other side where we were

     6           pointing back to the nightlife and down at the bottom, where

     7           it says philnight.html, we could once again name that

     8           document.  And it's oftentimes done in -- say for example in

     9           my own work, if I'm doing some statistical analysis of

    10           computer crimes during a particular period, I may preface a

    11           number of documents with the word -- with the letters APR,

    12           indicating April, and 001, 002, et cetera, or Week 1, Week 2,

    13           so I can identify specifically what those documents relate

    14           to.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Before they go on?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Before they -- as I create the

    17           document I then create the title once I save it as well.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And is it possible to pick out or

    19           is there some way in which you can say pick me out all

    20           documents that say APR up in the header?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor, there is.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, thank you.

    23                    THE WITNESS:  You're welcome.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I'm sorry to interrupt, but if this

    25           is to educate us I guess it has to come down to our level.

                                                                            21

     1                    THE WITNESS:  My pleasure, your Honors.  Thank you.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Go ahead.

     3                    THE WITNESS:  What I'd like to do at this time is

     4           once again scroll down the list by using the elevator on the

     5           right-hand side.  And having spent many childhood class

     6           trips, one of my favorite spots downtown here is Elfreths

     7           Alley.  I can then select by moving the mouse cursor over

     8           that particular area, and bringing the Court's attention once

     9           again to the lower left-hand corner, this is now a document

    10           called underscore elfreths.html, which could indicate to the

    11           user the contents of this particular link that I'm going to,

    12           this particular document.  I click that on one time, it goes

    13           out and redraws the page for me, and very nicely there is a

    14           beautiful photograph of one of my favorite spots, Elfreths

    15           Alley.  Also a narrative related to Elfreths Alley as I

    16           scroll down the scroll bar on -- the elevator bar on the

    17           right-hand side, giving some of the background of that

    18           particular street.  And another link which is relative to,

    19           say, maybe a visitor to the area that may not be that

    20           familiar with Philadelphia in preparation of a trip out here

    21           and looking for some information, I could then move the

    22           cursor over to the map of Philadelphia, where it says right

    23           here toward the bottom, click there one time.  And now I have

    24           gone out and retrieved this document that is the map of the

    25           Philadelphia area for this particular region.  And of course

                                                                            22

     1           I believe the court is somewhere over in this area where I'm

     2           pointing to now.  Now, if I would like, obviously it would be

     3           difficult if I was a traveler to carry my computer with me, I

     4           can at this point by clicking on the right mouse button, over

     5           this image with this particular browser, I can then save this

     6           image onto my computer system to where later on I could print

     7           it out on a printer, whether it's a nice color printer,

     8           whether it's a black and white printer, I can actually bring

     9           this image from the site where it is, bring it on my computer

    10           so I can use it later on as a map to carry around with me. 

    11           In this case I'm going to cancel that and go back.  And using

    12           the back video control, the VCR control as I referred to

    13           earlier, I can go back to the previous page and that's where

    14           we started from a moment ago.  And I can go back one more

    15           time and there is my selection list once again of items

    16           within the Philadelphia historic district.

    17                    And for the last portion of this one I'd like to

    18           once again go over and click at something of great interest,

    19           that's of course Independence Hall.  The image is immediately

    20           drawn to the screen and it gives you some of the history of

    21           Independence Hall as I click through there.  Obviously, your

    22           Honors, if there is any point if you'd like to have me stop

    23           and read this, I'd be more than happy to.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I'm sorry, we didn't hear -- I

    25           didn't hear you.

                                                                            23

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, at any point if you'd like me to

     2           stop to give you a chance to review the text.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I think we're familiar with the

     4           area.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No -- yeah.

     6                    (Laughter.)

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Thank you, your Honors.  And also,

     8           once again, it brings me down to where it has that same link

     9           to the map of historic Philadelphia.  Should I have elected

    10           to select this page other than Elfreths Alley first I still

    11           can select and go to the map of historic Philadelphia and

    12           view that particular map again.  And by using the back arrow

    13           I can go back to the beginning of the search engine here. 

    14           And I'm scrolling up fast, so nothing is wrong with your

    15           monitor, I'm doing that rapidly.

    16                    At this time what I'd like to do, the Court has

    17           heard some previous testimony about news groups and I'd like

    18           to go into some of the news groups, show you what's in there. 

    19           And areas that are non-sexually-explicit, just some graphic

    20           images that are currently on some of the news groups.  Before

    21           I do that I'd like to point out to the Court, if I may, that

    22           the information on this entire Internet system as well as in

    23           particularly the news groups changes dynamically.  So, some

    24           of the things that I may have found on there within the past

    25           hour may have already been changed or deleted by the people

                                                                            24

     1           that control those news servers.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Independence Hall?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Ma'am?

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Independence Hall?

     5                    THE WITNESS:  Independence Hall, they could

     6           conceivably have renamed that and done something like that,

     7           yes --

     8                    (Laughter.)

     9                    THE WITNESS:  -- very simply.  In this case I'm

    10           going to use another feature of the Netscape Browser, go up

    11           here to the windows.  And it has the ability to display

    12           Usenet groups or news groups with its own independent part of

    13           its computer system by clicking on that, it will go out and

    14           connect to a news site.  I'm going to bring this up full

    15           screen, so it's easy to read, by clicking this one box over 

    16           here.  And this is the interface or this is the part of the

    17           computer software that allows me to interact between the

    18           user, the end user here at the keyboard and the news groups. 

    19           One of the things I'd like to do is show that right here is

    20           the news server that I'm connected to and that's the server

    21           out there that has been provided by the Court for us to be

    22           able to retrieve some of these news groups and information. 

    23                    So, in order to go out there I'll go up and select

    24           the options menu... identify to the server that I would like

    25           to see all of the news groups that are out there... at which

                                                                            25

     1           point it goes out, as you can see, it appears, some different

     2           categories of news groups that are available and their

     3           titles.  I also would like to go back up to options and show

     4           all of the messages, because I do have the option of showing

     5           all of the messages that are currently available or only the

     6           ones that I have not read at this point.  That's a matter of

     7           ease, because oftentimes there's literally hundreds and

     8           hundreds of messages in a news group and you may read some at

     9           one sitting, come back later on, the next day and read some

    10           more, so you wouldn't have to go through all of the piles of

    11           already read postings, just go to the ones that you already

    12           have not read.

    13                    At this point I clicked on "show all unread

    14           messages."  As the Court can see, I can scroll down.  Some of

    15           the names of the news groups are pretty identifiable, such as

    16           AZ Jobs, it would indicate that's probably a news group

    17           related to Arizona jobs; BLT Jobs, one would think that might

    18           be related to jobs in Baltimore.

    19                    (Pause.)

    20                    THE WITNESS:  As you can see as I scroll through,

    21           there are some things in there that might not identify

    22           specifically what's in those news groups and one would

    23           actually have to go in those news groups to see what they're

    24           about.  At this point, keeping with our theme of

    25           Philadelphia, what I'd like to do is a little bit more

                                                                            26

     1           rapidly move down to one that I looked at.  There are some

     2           sub-news groups of Pennsylvania, presumably Pittsburgh, and

     3           in this particular instance Philadelphia.  Now, at this

     4           point, unlike the previous documents up here, for example the

     5           one I have referenced at AZ Jobs, presumably indicating

     6           Arizona jobs, these have a plus sign out here, which indicate

     7           that there are further subgroups within this group, as has

     8           been discussed with previous testimony about some of the

     9           types of racing cars that one might be interested in.  And it

    10           also indicates that under this group there's 23 different

    11           groups that are available, and the way to get that is very

    12           simply going over here to the file-folder-looking area,

    13           clicking on that, and I'll raise that up to where that's

    14           primarily what we see on the screen.  And you can see that

    15           there is -- out of those 23 news groups there's these

    16           subcategories out of here, and there's also some additional

    17           news groups as we see out -- in this area here, there's a

    18           plus sign, and under Philadelphia Jobs, there's two more

    19           subgroups underneath that.  We'll select the first one under

    20           "announce," if I may.

    21                    (Pause.)

    22                    THE WITNESS:  And on the right-hand side of the

    23           screen now indicates those postings which are currently

    24           available through this one server, through these -- and on

    25           this news server and in this particular subcategory of the

                                                                            27

     1           news group of phl.announce.  Now, for example, one of the

     2           documents I looked at last night was a pretty generic

     3           description of some of the previous court proceedings in this

     4           matter that someone had written and posted on here, and I

     5           printed that out.  Well, that's no longer on there, that was

     6           about a -- a little over a two-week-old message, so either on

     7           an automated manner or someone selected going out there, they

     8           removed that message from this particular news group.  It

     9           could have been the computer itself through like, as I said,

    10           an automated matter, it says once something gets to be two

    11           weeks old it automatically would remove it, or someone could

    12           have gone and said, okay, these messages are old enough, I'm

    13           going to change it.

    14                    At this point I'll go to the next one and, for

    15           example, something like the blood drive on March 26th, which

    16           presumably was an announcement related to that.  I click

    17           there and underneath in the bottom half of your screen is

    18           displayed that particular message that someone has posted. 

    19           This one appears to be posted by a person by the name of

    20           Monica Moll (ph.), and I apologize for not pronouncing that

    21           properly, at a computer system address that this person was

    22           using at Dolphin, apparently at the University of

    23           Pennsylvania, as indicated by the edu or an educational site,

    24           and it says underneath University of Pennsylvania.  And it

    25           talks about just a message that indicates that there's an

                                                                            28

     1           emergency blood shortage, they need some assistance.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Could you back up just for a

     3           minute?  Now, all someone needs to have this, is this

     4           correct, is a computer and access to the Internet and a modem

     5           in the word processor or the computer, right?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  A modem or a network connection of

     7           some sort, which are very similar, your Honor, yes, and also

     8           the software by which to view this, such as in this case

     9           we're using Netscape, because Netscape can do a lot of

    10           different things.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And that's all, so that my little

    12           laptop that's here that is -- that they did put it on

    13           Netscape just for purposes of this case, no E-mail, but just

    14           -- if I could figure out how to get it off and on, which I

    15           haven't been able to do today, I could follow you on this

    16           with -- or anyone, any of the judges or any of the lawyers

    17           could follow what you are doing, anybody in the courtroom if

    18           they had a connection could follow you, right?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honors, that's correct.  And

    20           particularly if they're reading the information from the same

    21           server that I'm reading it from it would be identical, absent

    22           the fact that if someone was on there before and checked off

    23           a message of being read, that message would not necessarily

    24           be displayed if they've already read it.  So, there may be a

    25           little bit of a difference between what I see and what you

                                                                            29

     1           see had you been before.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I see nothing, but that's all right

     3           at the moment.

     4                    THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry, if you were to see it.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, if I were to see it.

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  So, as you can see those are

     7           different announcements related presumably to the

     8           Philadelphia area and this case was one related to an

     9           emergency blood shortage which might be out there.

    10                    Okay, at this time, as I mentioned to the Court a

    11           few moments ago, what I'd like to do is display a beautiful

    12           graphic image, in this particular case I want to go back up

    13           to the news group alt.  Now, alt has been mentioned a few

    14           times in previous testimony, which stands for an alternative

    15           news group, which basically is a category which you can fit a

    16           lot of different subjects of information in that particular

    17           news group.  I'm going to scroll up there a little bit

    18           quicker...

    19                    (Pause.)

    20                    THE WITNESS:  And as I mentioned before to the

    21           Court, in this particular subcategory of news group, alt, it

    22           shows that there's 1,978 subcategories within this particular

    23           alt heading.  By double clicking on this the folder opens up,

    24           which sort of indicates opening up the drawer of a filing

    25           cabinet.  And as you can see as I scroll down here, there's a

                                                                            30

     1           number of different categories, there's a number of subgroups

     2           that might be available in there, and the one I'm moving down

     3           to is alt.pictures.  

     4                    (Pause.)

     5                    THE WITNESS:  What I'll do to expedite this, your

     6           Honor, is I'll just grab this elevator bar here and just move

     7           down a little bit quicker, because there are quite a few out

     8           there, as you can see.

     9                    (Pause.)

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Oops, I beg your Honors' pardon, I was

    11           going to go to alt.binaries, if I'm -- let me check my list

    12           here, I think I got off -- yes, I did.  I was going to go to

    13           alt.binaries, which has the subcategory of pictures.  Let me

    14           go back up --

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Why would you pick that?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Well, in this case I was out on the

    17           site last night and looked at alt.binaries, because

    18           alt.binaries generally refers to some of the graphic images

    19           or actual computer applications that might be out there,

    20           because there's subcategories that I know from using this,

    21           there's alt.binaries.pictures, and then you have different

    22           subcategories underneath there.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, does binaries have a sexual

    24           connotation or --

    25                    THE WITNESS:  No, it doesn't, your Honor --

                                                                            31

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, it doesn't, okay.

     2                    THE WITNESS:  -- no, it's strictly a generic

     3           computer term.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Binary simply means two media,

     5           right, two or more media?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct, yes.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.

     8                    (Pause.)

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  There, stop.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  As you can see, the

    11           alt.binaries has 78 different groups in there, and I can

    12           double click on this and bring me to the subcategories

    13           underneath alt.binaries.  And in this case there is once

    14           again sub-subcategories, documents, postings related to

    15           there, and I'm going to the one alt.binaries.pictures, which

    16           has 47 subgroups underneath there.  And I'll double click on

    17           that, and of course the first one that comes up is

    18           alt.binaries.pictures.animals.  And it says that there's 69

    19           unread postings in that particular news group and to make

    20           sure that I have all the ones, since I looked at the duck one

    21           earlier, I want to go back here and make sure that I show all

    22           messages irrespective of whether or not I have read them,

    23           which I have that selected, I click on this at this time. 

    24           And over on the right-hand side of the screen there's all the

    25           different postings there that are listed on this particular

                                                                            32

     1           news group and a brief subject line that the individual that

     2           posted this message has the opportunity to post it under what

     3           category and actually type into the line what it is that they

     4           want to identify this particular posting to mean.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Now, "cute racoon," okay?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honors.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Now, presumably "Who knows," which

     8           is the identifier there, has put a picture of a cute racoon,

     9           is that what we're to believe?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  That's what it indicates, your Honors,

    11           yes.  If your Honor would like I may -- I could select that

    12           and see if --

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sure, I like cute raccoons.

    14                    (Laughter.)

    15                    THE WITNESS:  I don't know that that's...

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I don't know how cute he is.

    17                    (Laughter.)

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Or she.

    19                    THE WITNESS:  What I'd like to do is go down the

    20           ones that I know I --

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Ducks, I like ducks.

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Ducks?  And go to the ducks.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I think everyone agrees, that's a

    24           cute duck.

    25                    (Laughter.)

                                                                            33

     1                    THE WITNESS:  And as you can see there are a number

     2           of different postings on here --

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  When you say it's posted or unread,

     4           does that -- once you have looked at it does it become read?

     5                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct, your Honor, it would

     6           be just like marking -- putting a bookmark in a publication

     7           you were reading that previous to here I have read this or

     8           you can select a particular page, I would do it oftentimes by

     9           folding over the corner, indicating to myself later on I read

    10           that page, this does it electronically for you.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Now, Mr. Schmidt, just one thing I'm

    12           not clear about, which is whoever put -- I guess this person

    13           put his or her E-mail address, the person who put this photo

    14           of this cute duck, I'm just looking at the top half of the

    15           screen there it says, "ducks, ducks and more ducks," and to

    16           the left there it has an E-mail address, do you see where

    17           you're showing with the pointer?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Now, that person, I assume -- let's

    20           assume that's an actual person, how did he or she load this

    21           into the system, this -- it's not a photograph of a duck,

    22           it's clearly a drawing or a painting or --

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Illustration.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- illustration that some human made

    25           of it, not a photo, how did that get on there?

                                                                            34

     1                    THE WITNESS:  What would happen, your Honor, in this

     2           particular case this is a direct posting.  They could have

     3           responded to an earlier posting, say someone said I would

     4           like to see some pictures of ducks they have the opportunity,

     5           just like in an E-mail system which we might be familiar

     6           with, to reply to that particular posting and attach a file. 

     7           In this case they have attached a file named duck1.jpb, which

     8           indicates that it's a graphic image, and they have attached

     9           that to their E-mail.  And this particular Browser does both,

    10           it allows you to read the message or the E-mail in that case

    11           or the posting that was there as well as displays the image

    12           for you at the same time, they would just simply attach it.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But -- perhaps I'm not clear -- how

    14           physically, the person who posted this illustration of this

    15           duck, how did he or she do that from -- let's assume it's a

    16           person that is at his or her home, how is it done?

    17                    THE WITNESS:  Okay, they would go over there and

    18           select the ability -- as you notice across the icons here

    19           across the top, you'll see this one where it says "reply" --

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes.

    21                    THE WITNESS:  -- they would go, select reply, and

    22           I'll select this particular document here, select reply.  And

    23           I have not specified my E-mail address in there, which is why

    24           that error message came up, but had I done that in

    25           configuring this application it would pop up with a window

                                                                            35

     1           and ask me to type in the message that I would like to post

     2           to this board, and I would type it in just like I was typing

     3           in any other document.  And then it would also have the

     4           ability to attach, when I go to select to send that response

     5           I would have the ability from that screen, oftentimes it's

     6           represented by a paper clip, to attach a file.  In this case

     7           conceivably there would be a file, this image residing on my

     8           computer system somewhere, duck1.jpb, I can tell it to attach

     9           it with that posting and then it sends it together through

    10           the Internet.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, for example, if Judge

    12           Buckwalter wanted to send Judge Dalzell something, Judge

    13           Buckwalter mentioned to him, let's say, that, gee, I saw a

    14           great ad for some shoes that you might like to see, how --

    15           could he without anything except for E-mail and Judge Dalzell

    16           without anything other than E-mail communicate that to Judge

    17           Dalzell through this mechanism?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Well -- and I use the term E-mail,

    19           because are most familiar with that, but that's a one-to-one

    20           transmission, this is available to numbers of people

    21           obviously.  And, yes, it would be very similar, because you

    22           could just attach that information, say an ad that you might

    23           have had scanned using a scanner or something that was

    24           residing on your --

    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  So, you would need a scanner, you

                                                                            36

     1           would need a scanner to scan the image that Judge Sloviter

     2           just mentioned?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  If it was an advertisement, as the

     4           Judge mentioned, yes, you would need some way to get that off

     5           of a piece of paper into your computer system if it didn't

     6           already exist there as an image.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Or what would be maybe more true to

     8           life, suppose Judge Dalzell is in -- well, Judge Buckwalter

     9           is in the country and Judge Dalzell is in the city, and Judge

    10           Buckwalter says there's a great -- I think we ought to read

    11           XYZ book next time and there's a great review of it in this

    12           local paper, and Judge Dalzell doesn't have the local paper,

    13           could -- how easy would it be for Judge Buckwalter to

    14           transmit that to Judge Dalzell and how much sophistication

    15           does he need -- more than I have, but how much sophistication

    16           does he need to be able to do that?

    17                    THE WITNESS:  Yeah, it would take a bit of

    18           understanding about the way the computer systems work.  You

    19           would need to understand, for example, taking it from a

    20           newspaper if it was, say, a number -- a three or four-

    21           paragraph review, you would of course have to clip it out if

    22           it didn't fit into a -- if you had a small hand scanner, clip

    23           it out so it would fit into that particular size, scan it

    24           into your computer system by -- once again, in most cases, by

    25           clicking on an icon that indicates scan.  You would click it

                                                                            37

     1           in there, have to save it as a file, and then attach that

     2           file as well.  So, you would have to pretty well know what

     3           you were doing to attach a file to an E-mail message like

     4           that or to a posting.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.

     6                    THE WITNESS:  You're welcome, your Honor.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's very helpful.

     8                    THE WITNESS:  And as you can see, your Honors,

     9           there's a couple more photographs, at least this appears it

    10           could be a photograph here of a duck...

    11                    (Pause.)

    12                    THE WITNESS:  And there's this last one, which I

    13           think was one of the more beautiful ones.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Nice ducks.

    15                    (Laughter.)

    16                    THE WITNESS:  I also like ducks.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right, I think we've seen

    18           enough cute ducks.

    19                    (Laughter.)

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  What I'd like to do, your

    21           Honors, with your permission of course, is to -- my next part

    22           of the demonstration what I'd like to do is do some of the

    23           demonstrations related to some of the items that I have

    24           prepared in my declaration.  And I would advise the Court at

    25           this time, some of them do contain some things that are

                                                                            38

     1           sexually explicit, and if the Court would like I can show you

     2           some of the steps I took to achieve some of these documents.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think you should be able to show

     4           us how you get to it, how --

     5                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor.  In this case, once

     6           again using --

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I assume that there's no objection

     8           to him showing us how he gets to those materials, before he

     9           shows us the materials?

    10                    MS. HEINS:  We have stated an objection in our

    11           conference call with Judge Dalzell earlier in the week both

    12           on the basis of the motion in limine argument --

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Are you on the mike?

    14                    MS. HEINS:  I'm sorry.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, you can come -- you can come

    16           just --

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Just turn that mike a little bit and

    18           it will pick you up.

    19                    MS. HEINS:  In our conference call earlier this week

    20           with Judge Dalzell we stated an objection to the live

    21           demonstration on two grounds; one of them is to the extent

    22           it's hard-core pornography and could be prosecuted under

    23           obscenity laws, it's not relevant here; and the second is

    24           simply that our understanding was that all direct testimony

    25           other than the Surfwatch demonstration was going to be by

                                                                            39

     1           affidavit and not by live demonstration.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, you had a demonstration and

     3           obviously it is relevant for the panel and to make a record

     4           as to the facility with which someone relatively

     5           unsophisticated, under 18, can reach the material, before we

     6           get to the material itself we may want to see, but certainly

     7           we will not stop him from -- it's the defendants' case to

     8           show that it's easy.  I'm proceeding on the assumption that a

     9           child can do it, I can't, but that's all right.

    10                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, I just would indicate, I

    11           would ask the witness to advise the Court before he actually

    12           clicked on the image if you didn't want him to and also to

    13           cite the exhibit in his book as to the image he's going to

    14           click on.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, oh, well, that would be very

    16           helpful --

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's fine.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- that would be very helpful --

    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  He will do that before he --

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- Mr. Coppolino.  Thank you --

    21                    MR. COPPOLINO:  -- clicks it on, he'll get you that

    22           link.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- that's a very constructive

    24           suggestion.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you, Mr. Coppolino.

                                                                            40

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Go ahead.  

     2                    THE WITNESS:  In this case I'm going to go back to

     3           the A to Z home page, which is actually where I started the

     4           previous search on the courts in Philadelphia from.  If the

     5           Court will notice, on this page here --

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Let me say for the record, I assume

     7           that when you show us the facility with which one can read

     8           this, the same facility would be relevant whether the

     9           material was obscene, clearly obscene as some of this is, or

    10           was arguably -- fell within the categories of the statute,

    11           i.e. indecent.  So, the actual demonstration of how one gets

    12           to it is clearly relevant.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, absolutely, yes.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  In this case, if your Honors remember,

    15           I started out by going to the Netsearch icon on the Web

    16           Browser up here.  And by going to that area, if the Court

    17           remembers, I was able to either search directly up here or go

    18           to some of the other search routines that are available.  For

    19           the purpose of my declaration one of the search routines I

    20           used was the Yahoo search engine, at which point I'd like to

    21           click on the word Yahoo.  

    22                    (Pause.)

    23                    THE WITNESS:  And provided that site is up and

    24           running it should go out and brings me to the Yahoo screen

    25           here.  Now, this is very similar to what we just saw moments

                                                                            41

     1           ago by clicking on Netsearch.  Netsearch, as many of the

     2           search routines do, give you the capability of not only using

     3           that particular search program, but also give you the ability

     4           to use other search programs, because each one of them

     5           handles the way they compile their data differently.  I

     6           believe in previous testimony it was discussed about some of

     7           them have computer robots that go out there and compile the

     8           data, some of them do, you know, human input, and some of

     9           them do a combination of the two.  So, you would get

    10           different search results using different search engines.  In

    11           this case Yahoo is one of the more popular ones, which is

    12           what I have used.  Also if you notice under Yahoo, there's a

    13           little line here that states options, by selecting options I

    14           can delineate in some form or fashion some of the search

    15           routines I'm doing.  For example, I can search everything

    16           within Yahoo, I could search the different Usenet groups, I

    17           could search different E-mail addresses.  I can search

    18           certain delimiters such as at least one of the keys that are

    19           -- the search phrase as I use it or all of the keys, that it

    20           must appear in both of it, and also whether they have to be a

    21           part of a word or complete words, I can delineate in certain

    22           areas some of my search routines.  In this case I'm asking

    23           for it to display 25 searches at a time on the screen.  There

    24           may be a number of results of the searches, but in this case

    25           I would only like to see 25 at a time.

                                                                            42

     1                    And pointing the Court to... I believe it's Exhibit

     2           2 in my declaration.  Now, what I did to obtain this document

     3           in Exhibit 2, I just typed in the three characters XXX into

     4           this window down here --

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  How did you know to do that, did it

     6           tell you?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  No, your Honors, no, that was just

     8           from my own experience --

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You just made it up?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Not just made up, I did it because I -

    11           - from my experience in doing these type of investigations

    12           this is one of the things that would generally give me

    13           listings of sexually-explicit materials.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I see.

    15                    THE WITNESS:  And what I'll --

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And is that general known, from

    17           your expertise is that -- is it generally known that anybody

    18           who was looking for this kind of material would know to put

    19           in XXX?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  To the extent that triple X-rated

    21           material --

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  They will now, but go ahead.

    23                    (Laughter.)

    24                    THE WITNESS:  I'm educating a broader audience, your

    25           Honor?

                                                                            43

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, but go ahead.

     2                    THE WITNESS:  To the extent that one searching for,

     3           as you'll see in a moment in the search, anything -- to the

     4           extent that someone would know XXX is something related to

     5           sexually-explicit information or the fact that the word sex

     6           or porn, to the extent -- that would be seem to be a

     7           reasonable answer, yes.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It would be fair to say, would it,

     9           that it is as well known to people who use this media as X-

    10           rated films are to people who go to films?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor, I believe that would

    12           be fair to say.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, that's...

    14                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  At this point, your Honors, by

    15           typing in the search string that I'm looking for, I click on

    16           the word search over here with one click of the mouse, and

    17           immediately you can see there's some search results.  I'll

    18           point out a couple things on the screen as it also appears

    19           similarly in my declaration -- I say similarly, because if

    20           you'll notice on the declaration, on Exhibit 2, it says there

    21           that there's 112 matches found, in this case there's 120. 

    22           So, evidently there have been some additional sites that have

    23           been added since I did this initial search which contain the

    24           characters XXX.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Including, for the record, Superbowl

                                                                            44

     1           Roman numeral 30.

     2                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct, your Honor.

     3                    (Laughter.)

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is that the one that just was?  I

     5           mean, is that a current Superbowl, I mean, is that the last

     6           one?

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's the last one, wasn't it?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  I believe so, your Honor.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  And, as the Court pointed out as I was

    11           about to, the first listing that it comes up hitting on is

    12           under a category of recreation, sports and football,

    13           Superbowl XXX or Superbowl 30.  And I could click just by

    14           going to anywhere along this line here, as I did in the

    15           previous demonstration, to the site that's associated with

    16           this.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, Mr. Schmidt, let's go back to

    18           my other question.  I don't see XXX, unless it's very small,

    19           in either the header where it says location or the -- let's

    20           call it the footer for this purpose, down at the bottom -- is

    21           it there?

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  There it is.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, that says football.

    24                    THE WITNESS:  The reason -- your Honors, if I may,

    25           the reason you see that at the bottom at this time is because

                                                                            45

     1           I have the pointer over that particular site, if I move it

     2           away from there you'll notice that will go away and the words

     3           "document done" will appear.  That's just showing that's the

     4           name of the link that this is going to.  And in this

     5           particular instance for the Superbowl the XXX or the 30,

     6           Roman numeral 30, appears within the naming convention that

     7           someone has elected to name this document that they have

     8           chosen to put in there.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But if you're looking for XXX there

    10           would be no way in which -- if I have the same computer in

    11           another room and I were a parent I wouldn't be able to know,

    12           you're saying, that you're looking at XXX, you, my child, are

    13           looking at XXX material, could I?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  Well, there's a couple things that

    15           would clue you in, your Honor.  One of the first things

    16           you'll notice up here under the search results, it indicates

    17           that I have found 120 matches containing the characters XXX. 

    18           So, if I was to look at the screen I could see, yes, that's

    19           what the search was that I had performed.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I'm sorry, I had just -- I'm just

    21           trying to understand another point that's going to -- that

    22           may or may not come later, and I had understood that it would

    23           be possible at all times to see what you were viewing or at

    24           least it would reveal it, and you're saying it really doesn't

    25           reveal it, is that right?

                                                                            46

     1                    THE WITNESS:  I'm still not quite sure I understand

     2           what your Honor means by revealing it at what time.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That the URL is displayed.

     4                    THE WITNESS:  Okay, yes.  In the display of the URL,

     5           for example, we'll go down here to this particular one under

     6           arts and humanities literature, published fiction, adult

     7           fiction, if you'll notice on the footers as you have pointed

     8           out, your Honor, that particular title contains nowhere near

     9           the words XXX.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's right.

    11                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.  And in this

    12           particular search routine, what this has responded to is the

    13           fact in the narrative, somewhere in the description that

    14           someone has put on the Yahoo search engine, it contains

    15           something related to XXX that the computer itself has

    16           interpreted by seeing it somewhere within that Website.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But, as an expert, would it be

    18           possible as far as you know that any time you ask for XXX --

    19           this may be a very unsophisticated question, but would it be

    20           possible any time that you display an XXX material or ask for

    21           XXX material it immediately has to show on the location, or

    22           is that just not in the technology?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  No, your Honor, it's very much so,

    24           because you can put whatever words or characters you want in

    25           the naming convention, as we discussed earlier, I believe it

                                                                            47

     1           was your earlier question about who decides how these things

     2           get named, these items get named, that is the individual that

     3           actually creates that item, they determine what name they

     4           want to put in there.  For example, if I -- what I have

     5           elected in this particular document, instead of using the

     6           word adult underscore fiction, to type in XXX underscore

     7           fiction, I could elect to do that and using that naming

     8           convention through anything out -- just as I did with the APR

     9           for April, and that would always appear in that URL address,

    10           as the Judge mentioned.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But it's your option, in other

    12           words?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct, your Honors, yes.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And it's not the option of anyone

    15           higher up on the scale of getting into the document?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  You as the creator of that document

    17           would be the one that determines the name of that document.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor.

    20                    Okay, as you can see, your Honors, in addition to

    21           the Superbowl XXX category that's being displayed there, and

    22           I'll scroll up just below that, so you may see some of the

    23           rest of them, as much as we can get on the screen at one

    24           time, there's -- once again, it relates to the Host Marriott

    25           gamewear, some Superbowl XXX hats and T-shirts.  Someone has

                                                                            48

     1           elected in their description of that particular Website to

     2           include the XXX, which indicates the 30, that this appears in

     3           that description of that site, so that's why the Yahoo search

     4           engine picked up and displayed this text.

     5                    The next one down in the subcategory of business and

     6           economy, the XXX adult software, et cetera.  As you can see,

     7           your Honors, you have a large selection out of the first 25. 

     8           And notwithstanding the blue links, which are actually the

     9           links to the sites that are associated with this information,

    10           in the narrative side, going down the right-hand side in the

    11           black text, you can see why this particular search routine

    12           selected on the XXX even though, if you'll notice, as I go

    13           over One Superhot Adult Mall, in the lower left-hand, the

    14           footers you would call it, the characters XXX do not appear

    15           in that name, because someone has elected not to use that

    16           title.

    17                    Now, continuing on, if I may, your Honors, with the

    18           information as it is contained in my declaration.  I'd like

    19           to go down to the link here --

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Would anybody have the authority,

    21           as far as you know -- I'm not talking about legal authority,

    22           but technical ability to require that any material that goes

    23           on or is found through a Yahoo search must accurately

    24           designate with XXX or adult or whatever designation might be

    25           used to access this kind of material?

                                                                            49

     1                    THE WITNESS:  The descriptions, your Honor, that are

     2           associated with this are put in -- for example, I have my own

     3           Website, I can list that as a Yahoo site and I -- I elect to

     4           type into the description whatever characters I elect to

     5           describe my Website.  So, in -- yes, you could go in there

     6           and type XXX on every site that's related to this if you put

     7           that description in the search engine itself.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, thank you.

     9                    THE WITNESS:  You're welcome, your Honor.  And going

    10           down here, which is reference to Exhibit 3 in my declaration,

    11           I'll click on Las Vegas showgirls and it has a description

    12           alongside there... it's going out and reading that document.

    13                    (Pause.)

    14                    THE WITNESS:  And this document is being displayed,

    15           as it was very similar to the day on April the 3rd when I

    16           printed this document for my declaration.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Just for the record, this is the

    18           page that is headed "WARNING, WARNING, WARNING," in all caps.

    19                    THE WITNESS:  And as you can see by some of the

    20           black text it has the warnings, as the Judge pointed out.  It

    21           also has a statement in here, it says if you're under the age

    22           of 18 or offended by adult-oriented material you are not

    23           authorized to access this site.  It also has, down below

    24           you'll notice it has a direct link, if you watch the cursors

    25           I place it over, a direct link to the Surfwatch home page,

                                                                            50

     1           which I believe we saw a demonstration of a few weeks ago, or

     2           moving down below that it also has a direct link to the

     3           Cyberpatrol home page.  So --

     4                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Now, at this point you're not

     5           going to display the picture though that's already in our

     6           exhibit book?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct, your Honor.

     8                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  You're not going to, okay.

     9                    THE WITNESS:  At this point I'm not prepared to do

    10           that.

    11                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Very well.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's the next click, right?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  That would be the case, your Honor. 

    14           At this point, if I elected to do so and if the Court so

    15           chose, I could go up here to where it says, yes, I am over 18

    16           years old, which I am, and I could click on this.  And as you

    17           can see down in the lower left-hand corner again is the

    18           footer, that would then connect me to a site called

    19           www.sexvision.com/main.htm.  And main.htm is actually the

    20           name of the document that this would then connect to, which

    21           would be the one in the next page of my declaration.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And we would know that and it's

    23           identified because on the right-hand side of the -- right-

    24           hand top side of the document itself it has precisely what

    25           you just read?

                                                                            51

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It has the Website address?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor.  Netscape, when I

     3           print this up, puts that information in there for you, which

     4           is very good for tracking where these things --

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And that's why it's on the exhibits

     6           that you all prepared for us?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct, your Honors, yes. 

     8           Netscape did that automatically, put all that information --

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, you didn't have to do anything

    10           to make it do that?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  No, your Honor, it did that

    12           automatically with the date and time, the description as the

    13           site user has placed in there, for example, in the upper

    14           left-hand corner of the second part of that exhibit, which

    15           actually has the graphic image, it says, "Sex vision.  Sexy

    16           live nude adult video teleconferencing."  That's actually put

    17           on there by reading it from the site, those are not things

    18           that I typed on there.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And that is obscene, is it not,

    20           that picture is obscene?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  That would be something -- a

    22           determination for the Court, your Honors.  It does display

    23           some sexually-explicit materials you can see on the next page

    24           or, if the Court would like, I could click over there.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, you don't have to click on

                                                                            52

     1           there, we've seen it.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because we -- because if you clicked

     3           we would have Exhibit 3, right?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  You would have the second page --

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The second page of --

     6                    THE WITNESS:  -- of Exhibit 3.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- Exhibit 3?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, so we don't need to do that.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  At this point, your Honors, if

    11           I may, I'd like to go back for a moment to the search --

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  How many -- all right, well, you'll

    13           tell us later how many clicks it took you to get to that.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  I may answer that question right now,

    15           if you'd like, your Honor, because it's --

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, I think it's part of your

    17           direct test -- your testimony, so I'll wait, you'll get

    18           cross-examined on that.  Go ahead, you do what you want.

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Thank you, your Honor.  Okay, at this

    20           time, your Honor, what I'd like to do is go back to the

    21           search results that we started from a moment ago.  As you can

    22           see the fact that I went to the Las Vegas showgirls, that

    23           text is a little bit different color and that's something

    24           that I set up within the Web Browser myself.  So, if I was

    25           doing some research for something and accessed a hundred

                                                                            53

     1           links I could go back, instead of having to remember or write

     2           down which one I went to, I could just go back and see the

     3           fact by the different color that I had already been at that

     4           link, that's one of the features built into the browser.

     5                    In this instance what I'd like to do is go to the

     6           next 25 matches, which relate to Exhibit Number 10 in my

     7           declaration.  And as you can see, your Honors, there is -- it

     8           says it's displaying matches 26 through 50 and I will scroll

     9           up to see all of the different choices I have of the search

    10           results there.  So, I have clicked from the search, the next

    11           25 over to here with one click.  Now, going on to -- that was

    12           Exhibit 10, your Honors.  Going on to Exhibit 11, which I am

    13           not going to click to --

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right.

    15                    THE WITNESS:  -- I can go down here to the

    16           selection, the Honey.  And once again, your Honors, pointing

    17           to your earlier question, on the lower left-hand or the

    18           footer, so to speak, it now says down there www.bolero.com,

    19           that's because I have the pointer over that site called the

    20           Honey.  I'd like to bring the Court's attention, if I may, to

    21           the fact that you had mentioned earlier about the Website

    22           address on the upper right-hand corner of my document in the

    23           declaration, which says WWW.APPEALO.COM (ph.).  At some point

    24           since I was at that site they have changed the link to a new

    25           domain name, instead of appealo it's now bolero, and that's

                                                                            54

     1           been since -- April the 3rd is when I prepared that document

     2           for my declaration and now it's changed to another site name.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Schmidt, to get the hard copy

     4           did you simply print?

     5                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor, I would --

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I mean, to prepare the exhibits, if

     7           somebody wanted to see one of these pictures and then get a

     8           hard copy as you have given us would they just print or it

     9           doesn't work that way?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honors.  For example, the

    11           information we have currently displayed on our screen, the

    12           results of the Websearch --

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  -- all I would have to do is to print

    15           that out as I have for my declaration, is go up here to where

    16           it says print, this little icon right here --

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.

    18                    THE WITNESS:  -- select print by clicking the mouse

    19           once.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, well, like you do in a word

    21           processor.

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Exactly, your Honors, exactly.  And it

    23           would come up with a print window and ask me if I wanted to

    24           print and what printer I would like to use if I had more than

    25           one printer selected.  And that's the way I have prepared the

                                                                            55

     1           rest of the document, I would click -- say, for example, if I

     2           were to click to the Honey for the purpose of the Court, then

     3           I could -- when said image is displayed on my screen I could

     4           go up to the print icon and then print that -- print that

     5           image just as it appears in the declaration.

     6                    Now, in preparation for my demonstration, in

     7           reviewing this, the image that currently is in my declaration

     8           under Exhibit Number 11 no longer exists, not only is that

     9           same site not the name off of the site, the Honey, but the

    10           image itself is not the same.  As I viewed it last night,

    11           there are now some blue splotches on appropriate places on

    12           the image that would effectively cover up certain portions of

    13           that image now that are currently on that site.

    14                    If your Honors like, I would continue on.  And what

    15           I'll do is go to another match and this is related to Exhibit

    16           37.

    17                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, if I may --

    18                    THE COURT:  Yes, Mr. Coppolino?

    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  -- the revision of the image he just

    20           referred to is also that Exhibit 50, that image, the Honey,

    21           we have the revised image.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, Exhibit 37.

    23                    (Pause.)

    24                    THE WITNESS:  And what I have done is I have clicked

    25           on the next 25 sites, indicating up at the top -- I haven't

                                                                            56

     1           done that yet, have I?  I've clicked on the next, which

     2           indicate matches 51 through 75.  And the Court will notice

     3           the -- let me make sure I've got this exhibit correct -- I'm

     4           sorry, your Honors, it's -- Exhibit 37 is the search results,

     5           which is not the same as what I currently have on the screen

     6           once again, because I mentioned earlier that the number of

     7           sites have increased since I initially did the search, so,

     8           therefore, the page numbering system is changed over.  So, in

     9           this case I'll actually have to go to the next 25 matches...

    10           displaying 76 to 100, to get to the areas as I have noticed

    11           in my declaration in Exhibit Number 38, which is the BBS

    12           portion, the bulletin board system portion of the search

    13           results.  The document in my declaration at Exhibit Number 38

    14           is the Website from the Southshore Secrets BBS.  And, once

    15           again, the Court may take notice at the lower left-hand

    16           corner, that's the name of the site that this particular

    17           Southshore Secret BBS link is linked to.

    18                    Now, your Honors, I'd like to go ahead and click to

    19           this next site.  As of last night it did not contain any

    20           sexually-explicit material in the next click, but I'll warn

    21           the Court, sometimes these things change and --

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Why do you have to click to it?  I

    23           mean --

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Because what happens on the next page,

    25           your Honor, since I originally printed this document for the

                                                                            57

     1           declaration, they have changed the name of the location of

     2           this site.  So, what they have done, and with the Court's

     3           permission --

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, I don't know, let me...

     5                    (Discussion held off the record.)

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Coppolino, what is the point of

     7           -- what is the point he's trying to show by this specific

     8           point?

     9                    MR. COPPOLINO:  This is the last example, but I

    10           believe the next click will show that the particular site

    11           name changed and the screen -- the next screen will show that

    12           it changed and it will give you the hypertext link to the new

    13           site.  So, it shows the Court, A, that they can change the

    14           name of the site itself and, B, that you can click on and get

    15           to it after they change the name, that's what the next screen

    16           would show.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Isn't that what he just showed us

    18           with his prior testimony when he had a different name --

    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Very similar to that, exactly.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- and then they put the two black

    21           dots?

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, when you click on this is there

    23           going to be that same picture or is there just going to be

    24           text?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  No, your Honors, it will just be text,

                                                                            58

     1           presumably, as what I saw last night was strictly just text.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I'd like to see it, thank you, I'd

     3           like to see it.

     4                    THE WITNESS:  Okay, clicking on here... and it

     5           indicates that this site has been moved from what I have --

     6           the site location was included in my declaration, it also

     7           provides the link to the new site, which is a different URL

     8           address than the previous one, a different name included in

     9           there.  And the reason being, it's stated by whomever put

    10           this page on there that due to overwhelming response the site

    11           has been moved to its own Webserver, it's own computer

    12           system.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Does that statement, based on your

    14           experience, does that statement, A, make sense; B, strike you

    15           as credible?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Very much so, your Honor, yes.  That's

    17           one where one would -- in order for its users or its fans, so

    18           to speak, to be able to follow the links they put that on

    19           there and it says, okay, here's -- I'm no longer at this

    20           location, here's where I am now, click here to go to it.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And that's because the new server

    22           can take more traffic, if you will?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Apparently, based on the way it

    24           appears here, yes, your Honor.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, fine, that's interesting.

                                                                            59

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Then if I were to --

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And that would be true as to

     3           anything?  For example, if all of a sudden an event was

     4           coming to Philadelphia, going back to what you had said

     5           before, which got a lot of traffic, people wanted to know

     6           whether tickets were available, is it that kind of site also

     7           that they would move to a --

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  A server with more capacity?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honors, that's quite

    10           correct, but if I may explain.  What one may find out that we

    11           have -- for example, the Federal Judicial Center may have a

    12           lot of different Websites on that one particular server and

    13           through the course of the day are being accessed, they elect

    14           at one point to put something else.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, they would be delighted, but

    16           I would be surprised, there might be other things.

    17                    (Laughter.)

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No, but you're -- but to follow your

    19           example --

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The point is --

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- to follow your example, if their

    22           Website on court-annexed arbitration, a subject near and dear

    23           to this Court, that there was so much traffic on it that they

    24           moved that to a new server because they were getting so many

    25           requests at the same time, is that what you're saying is

                                                                            60

     1           happening here?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct, your Honor, yes.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  So, it's just reflecting

     4           demand?

     5                    THE WITNESS:  That's -- the demand, your Honor, yes,

     6           and also the ability to meet that demand without the

     7           hesitation and delays that we have seen through some of the

     8           sites once they get real busy, it may slow down the traffic. 

     9           So, you move it off to where there is only a singular

    10           function on there instead of multiple people coming in.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, very helpful --

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- thank you.  

    14                    THE WITNESS:  And if I --

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Did you say that was it on the

    16           demonstration?  I'm sorry.

    17                    THE WITNESS:  Just to conclude, your Honor, if I

    18           were to click on that site there then it would be the -- go

    19           to the page that's --

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Then we would see Exhibit 38 for

    21           identification?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor, that's correct.

    23                    At this time, that would conclude the formal

    24           demonstration, your Honors, and I would be happy to entertain

    25           any questions you might have.

                                                                            61

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, I think at this point --

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, I think there is cross-

     3           examination first.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But it might be a good point to

     5           break.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, yes.

     7                    (Laughter.)

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, we'll take a five-minute

     9           break -- is that what we've been taking?

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Ten.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Ten.

    12                    (Court in recess; 10:54 to 11:08 a.m.)

    13                    THE COURT CLERK:  Please be seated.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, I think we're ready for cross-

    15           examination.

    16                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

    17           BY MS. HEINS:  

    18           Q   Good morning, Mr. Schmidt.

    19           A   Good morning again.

    20           Q   Nice to see you again.

    21           A   Nice to see you, thank you.

    22           Q   Mr. Schmidt, you are highly expert in the use of

    23           computers, are you not?

    24           A   Yes, I am.

    25           Q   And you've, over the years of your law enforcement

                                                                            62

     1           career, you've engaged in many different sophisticated

     2           computer searches for pornographic materials?

     3           A   Yes, I have.

     4           Q   So that it's fair to say you can get around the Internet

     5           pretty quickly?

     6           A   That's correct, yes.

     7           Q   Now, the materials, the large stack of materials that you

     8           supplied to the Court today, you accessed some of these

     9           materials originally on a home computer, is that right?

    10           A   That's correct, yes.

    11           Q   And this was a 60 megahertz pentium-based computer that

    12           you built yourself?

    13           A   That's correct, yes.

    14           Q   And in fact this is one of approximately ten computers

    15           that you have in your home, is that right?

    16           A   That is correct, yes.

    17           Q   Now, a pentium base is a state-of-the-art, most advanced

    18           computer system available, is it not?

    19           A   Depending upon the speed, pentium is the most recent

    20           series.  The speed of mine is not the state of the art.

    21           Q   Can you explain what you mean by the speed?

    22           A   Yes, I can.  I mentioned or you mentioned there or the

    23           question was about a 60 megahertz which relates to the clock

    24           speed of the central processing unit or the computer itself. 

    25           Currently under the pentium series of chips that's produced

                                                                            63

     1           by Intel Corporation they go as high as up to 200 megahertz

     2           which are significantly faster processing computers.

     3           Q   And does faster processing mean that you would be able to

     4           call up an image faster once you click on your screen?

     5           A   That would be one part of it, yes.

     6           Q   Are there also computers which have much slower than 60

     7           megahertz processing?

     8           A   Yes, there are.

     9           Q   And some of  the images that you supplied to the Court

    10           today you also accessed on a computer at your work site at

    11           Boeing Air Force Base?

    12           A   That's correct, yes.

    13           Q   And what's the speed of that computer?

    14           A   That particular computer is a 486 DX-100 which is the

    15           previous series of central processing unit chips.

    16           Q   And in comparison to the 60 megahertz that you have at

    17           home, what's the memory of that computer at work?

    18           A   The one at work has 16 megabyte of memory in it which is

    19           the same as I have in my system at home.

    20           Q   Now, when you first start working on finding pornographic

    21           images for this case you also brought a brand new color laser

    22           printer for home use, isn't that right?

    23           A   No, it's not.

    24           Q   Didn't you buy a brand new color laser printer on the day

    25           that you started searching for pornographic pictures in this

                                                                            64

     1           case?

     2           A   No, I did not.

     3           Q   When did you -- okay, what -- what laser printer did you

     4           use at home to print out some of the pictures when you began

     5           investigating pornography on the Internet for purposes of

     6           this case?

     7           A   I did not use a laser printer at home, I use an ink jet

     8           printer.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is a laser printer color or is it

    10           just the ink jet printer that's color?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Both of them could be either black and

    12           white or color, your Honor.

    13           BY MS. HEINS:  

    14           Q   Okay, you bought on the day you began working on the

    15           investigation in this case you bought a Canon 610 color

    16           printer?

    17           A   That's correct, yes.

    18           Q   And that's an ink jet and a laser printer?

    19           A   That's correct, yes.

    20           Q   Okay.  And one of the purposes of that purpose was to

    21           print out pictures in connection with this case, isn't that

    22           right?

    23           A   Yes, it was.

    24           Q   Now, at work you also printed out some pictures that have

    25           been supplied to this Court as exhibits, is that right?

                                                                            65

     1           A   Yes.

     2           Q   And your color printer at work is a laser printer, is it

     3           not?

     4           A   That is correct, yes.

     5           Q   It's a QMS LX color laser printer, correct?

     6           A   Yeah.

     7           Q   And that printer is even more elaborate than the new

     8           printer you bought for home use for purposes of this case,

     9           isn't that right?

    10           A   Yes, that's correct.

    11           Q   Now, the time it takes to print out an image varies with

    12           the speed of the printer, does it not?

    13           A   That's one of the factors, yes.

    14           Q   And not everybody, it's fair to say, has a QMS LX color

    15           laser printer in their home, do they?

    16           A   That's correct, yes.

    17           Q   Now, you also used, I think you told me at your

    18           deposition a 28.8 baud modem with your computer in order to

    19           call up sites on the Internet?

    20           A   That's correct, yes.

    21           Q   And this is a state-of-the-art speed modem, is it not?

    22           A   To the extent that it's -- the speed of it is state of

    23           the art, yes.

    24           Q   And there are similar modems in existence, are there not?

    25           A   Yes, there are.

                                                                            66

     1           Q   For example if you had used a 14 baud modem it would take

     2           longer for an image to appear on the screen?

     3           A   That would be correct, yes.

     4           Q   And if you used a nine baud modem it would be even

     5           slower, wouldn't it?

     6           A   I'm not familiar with the term a nine baud modem.

     7           Q   Are there modems slower than 14 baud?

     8           A   Yes, there are, 14.4, yes.

     9           Q   If you used one slower than 14 baud would the image

    10           appear on the screen more slowly?

    11           A   That's correct, yes.

    12           Q   Do you have any knowledge of how many homes in the United

    13           States that have computers have 28.8 baud modems as opposed

    14           to slower ones?

    15           A   No, I don't. 

    16           Q   Have any knowledge of how many homes in the U.S. have

    17           QHS-LX color laser printers?

    18           A   No, I don't.

    19           Q   Now, of course, you also need a Webbrowser such as

    20           NetScape to find the Web sites that you've demonstrated to

    21           the Court, don't you?

    22           A   That's correct, yes.

    23           Q   You also need at least one search engine such as Yahoo or

    24           Lykos?

    25           A   Access to one of those search engines, yes.

                                                                            67

     1           Q   So without a Webbrowser you couldn't find any of the

     2           sites that you've demonstrated, any of the Web sites?

     3           A   That would be fundamentally correct, yes.

     4           Q   And without at least one search engine you also would

     5           have a very hard time finding Web sites whether pornographic

     6           or any other kind?

     7           A   It would make it more difficult, yes.

     8           Q   Do you have any idea how many homes that have computers

     9           in the United States have Webbrowsers?

    10           A   No, I do not.

    11           Q   Have any idea how many of them have search engines?

    12           A   No, I do not.

    13           Q   Now, some computers don't even have sufficient memory to

    14           tell a printer to print an image at all, do they?

    15           A   That would be correct, yes.

    16           Q   Do you have any idea how many homes in the United States

    17           have computers with sufficient memory to tell a printer to

    18           print?

    19           A   No, I -- no, I don't.

    20           Q   Now, every time you make a connection on the Internet to

    21           a different site it can take minutes as opposed to just

    22           seconds to access that site, to actually call it up on the

    23           screen, depending on modem speed and how busy the Internet

    24           is, among other factors, isn't that right?

    25           A   That is correct, yes.

                                                                            68

     1           Q   By the way, in the course of your searches you accessed a

     2           number of sites that had an overseas as opposed to a domestic

     3           United States origin, didn't you?

     4           A   Yes, I did.

     5           Q   But you can't quantify the percentage of pornographic

     6           sites that you accessed -- or let me rephrase that.  You

     7           can't quantify the percentage of pornographic sites on the

     8           Internet that have overseas origins, can you?

     9           A   No, I cannot, no. 

    10                    MS. HEINS:  Excuse me, pagination problem.

    11                    (Pause.)

    12           BY MS. HEINS:  

    13           Q   Now, Mr. Schmidt, your expertise is in computer

    14           forensics, is it not?

    15           A   That's one of the areas, yes.

    16           Q   And that includes, for example, securing computer

    17           documents during criminal investigations?

    18           A   That's correct.

    19           Q   It includes finding files that may be disguised somewhere

    20           in cyberspace?

    21           A   That's correct, yes.

    22           Q   It includes the ability to extract files, to extract

    23           documents from computer files without their being altered?

    24           A   That's correct, yes.

    25           Q   Now, you've claimed some expertise in your declaration as

                                                                            69

     1           to the, quote, "widespread," unquote, availability of what

     2           you described as sexually explicit sites on the Internet,

     3           correct?

     4           A   That is correct, yes.

     5           Q   By the way, by sexually explicit sites are you really

     6           referring to pornographic sites as opposed to other types of

     7           sexually explicit information such as safer sex information

     8           or sexually explicit descriptions that may appear in

     9           literature?

    10                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, I object to the question

    11           as ambiguous.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You can answer.

    13                    THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry, what was the question,

    14           please?

    15           BY MS. HEINS:  

    16           Q   When you talk in your declaration about sexually explicit

    17           sites you really mean that sub-category of sexually explicit

    18           sites that are pornographic in nature, don't you?

    19           A   The category I referred to was the entire gamut, I

    20           believe, of sexually explicit graphic material that was out

    21           there.

    22           Q   Well, what I'm asking you is wasn't your search really

    23           confined to the sub-category of pornographic material, adult

    24           sites basically?

    25           A   Adult sites, yes.

                                                                            70

     1           Q   Okay.  Now, you haven't conducted any formal studies,

     2           have you, of the amount of pornographic or adult material

     3           that's available on line?

     4           A   No, I haven't.

     5           Q   And you can't quantify what the percentage of that

     6           material is in relation to the entire spectrum of content on

     7           the Internet, can you?

     8           A   No, I cannot.

     9           Q   And the opinion you express in your declaration that the

    10           number of what you call sexually explicit sites are growing

    11           is not based on any quantitative analysis, is it?

    12           A   No, it's not.

    13           Q   It's really just your impression, isn't it?

    14           A   No, it's my experience, not an impression.

    15           Q   Now, your experience is based on being a law enforcement

    16           officer investigating sexually explicit materials that might 

    17           be illegal, isn't that right?

    18           A   My experience involving that type of thing is one part of

    19           it, yes.

    20           Q   Okay.  And in this case when you were conducting your

    21           search, for the most part you typed in key words that you

    22           knew were going to lead you to adult sites, didn't you?

    23           A   That's correct, yes.

    24           Q   You were not looking for other sexually explicit sites,

    25           for example, that might concern safer sex, were you?

                                                                            71

     1           A   No, I was not.

     2           Q   You were not looking for sites that might have sexually

     3           explicit material relating to reproduction --

     4           A   No, I was not.

     5           Q   -- birth control?

     6           A   No, I was not.

     7           Q   And in fact you didn't even look for sites that might

     8           contain one of the seven -- the seven dirty words which you

     9           understand to be the basis of the Federal Communications

    10           Commission's indecency definition, did you?

    11           A   That's correct, I did not.

    12           Q   Now, Mr. Schmidt, on Page 4 of your declaration you say

    13           you believe you are qualified to offer expert opinion on,

    14           among other things, the existence of mechanisms that are

    15           being offered by certain Web sites to restrict access by

    16           minors.  That's on Page 4 of your declaration, Paragraph 5,

    17           Subparagraph Roman numeral IV.

    18           A   That's correct, yes.

    19           Q   And you maintain you are an expert on the subject of

    20           existence of mechanisms offered by certain Web sites to

    21           restrict access by minors?

    22           A   To the extent that they exist, yes.

    23           Q   In fact, your knowledge of these mechanisms, these adult

    24           identification or screening mechanisms is limited to what

    25           you've read on Webpages, isn't it?

                                                                            72

     1           A   That is correct, yes.

     2           Q   In fact you don't know if so-called adult verification,

     3           that's a term that's reflected in some of your exhibits, is

     4           different from a system of user ID password or the so-called

     5           First Virtual system; you don't know if they're all different

     6           or if they're in fact the same thing, do you?

     7           A   That's correct, I do not know that.

     8           Q   And you have no knowledge of what software is involved

     9           with any of these systems, adult verification or First

    10           Virtual, correct?

    11           A   That's correct, yes.

    12           Q   And as to credit card verification, your knowledge of how

    13           that works is limited to what you've picked up perusing Web

    14           sites, isn't that right?

    15           A   That plus experience in previous investigations in

    16           bulletin board systems and people requiring credit card

    17           access for those.

    18           Q   You have no knowledge of the cost that would be involved

    19           in instituting a credit card verification system, do you?

    20           A   No, I don't.

    21           Q   You don't know whether it's possible, whether it's even

    22           possible to institute such a system if there's no financial

    23           transaction taking place, do you?

    24           A   No, I do not.

    25           Q   And you don't really know what the First Virtual is, do

                                                                            73

     1           you?

     2           A   Other than what I've read, no.

     3           Q   And what you've read has been limited to the Web site

     4           screens that you showed us in your exhibits?

     5           A   That's correct, yes.

     6           Q   The most in fact that you can say about First Virtual 

     7           is that you think it appears to be a service that's a sort of

     8           verification of authenticity, is that right?

     9           A   That's based on reading what's on the screen, yes.

    10           Q   And you've never talked with any person involved with any

    11           of the adult sites that you've visited that uses an adult

    12           verification system to find out how they manage that system,

    13           have you?

    14           A   No, I did not.

    15           Q   And you have no knowledge of whether any adult

    16           verification system that you've mentioned in your declaration

    17           is usable outside the context of Web sites or bulletin

    18           boards, for example, whether it would be usable for news

    19           groups, do you?

    20           A   That's correct.

    21           Q   You don't know whether any of these adult verification

    22           systems would be usable for list exploders, do you?

    23           A   No, I do not.

    24           Q   Mail exploders, excuse me, or list serves, and you don't

    25           know whether any adult verification system would be usable or

                                                                            74

     1           feasible for on-line chat rooms, do you?

     2           A   That's correct, I do not.

     3           Q   And you have no idea whether any of these adult

     4           verification systems would be feasible for nonprofit

     5           organizations that run largely or totally on volunteer labor,

     6           do you?

     7           A   No, I do not.

     8           Q   Now, finally, Mr. Schmidt, I think you also claim

     9           expertise with respect to looking at Page 4 of your

    10           declaration, Paragraph 5, Subsection Roman numeral V, the

    11           practical ability of parents to deal with the easy

    12           availability of sexually explicit material on their own, you

    13           claim expertise in that area?

    14           A   That's correct, yes.

    15           Q   Now, your knowledge of whether parents either in general

    16           or any particular parents have the ability to control their

    17           children's access to the Internet is basically anecdotal,

    18           isn't it?

    19           A   Through my teachings, yes.

    20           Q   Through  your interactions with parents asking informal

    21           questions at conferences that you've attended?

    22           A   That's correct, yes.

    23           Q   You haven't done any formal study of the ability of

    24           parents to supervise their children while using computers,

    25           have you?

                                                                            75

     1           A   No, I have not, no.

     2           Q   You don't have any formal training in family psychology

     3           or child psychology, do you?

     4           A   No.

     5           Q   In fact you have no knowledge of how many minors use

     6           computers, do you?

     7           A   Not specifically, no.

     8           Q   You don't know of any specific statistics regarding

     9           households with minors that have computer systems, do you?

    10           A   I know of one study that recently was publicized in one

    11           of the period-- periodicals regarding number of households

    12           with computers and number where children use them but I don't

    13           know the specifics from it.

    14           Q   You don't know the specific statistics, do you?

    15           A   No, I do not.

    16           Q   Now, a number of the adult sites you visited, and I think

    17           this is reflected in the exhibits, had notices and links to

    18           various parental software blocking products that are offered

    19           on the market, didn't they?

    20           A   Yes, they did.

    21           Q   Now, in fact when parents at these conferences have

    22           informally asked you for your advice about how they can

    23           prevent their children from accessing sexually explicit

    24           material on line you've told them about the availability of

    25           just these products, haven't you?

                                                                            76

     1           A   Not the specific products, the availability of products

     2           similar to that, yes.

     3           Q   And when parents ask you these questions you also advise

     4           them that what they should do is become knowledgeable about

     5           what their kids are doing on line?

     6           A   That's correct, yes.

     7           Q   And you also advise them to take appropriate classes and

     8           learn what's on the computer system that they own and make

     9           sure they're aware of what's going on before they turn their

    10           kids loose, haven't you?

    11           A   Yes, I have.

    12                    MS. HEINS:  Nothing further.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Coppolino?

    14                    MS. HEINS:  I think Ms. Kappler has a few questions. 

    15           I'm sorry.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Fine.

    17                    MS. KAPPLER:  Thank you, your Honors, Ann Kappler

    18           for the ALA plaintiffs.

    19                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

    20           BY MS. KAPPLER:

    21           Q   Good morning, Mr. Schmidt.

    22           A   Good morning again, nice to see you.

    23           Q   Before turning to a couple questions regarding your

    24           declaration in this I'd like to go over a few points that

    25           came out during the questioning by the Court during your

                                                                            77

     1           demonstration.

     2                    Judge Sloviter asked you a question regarding the

     3           creation of the names in the URL to the Webpage addresses and

     4           I believe you indicated to the Court that the person who

     5           creates the Webpage or the Web name actually types in and

     6           decides what the name of the page is going to be, is that

     7           accurate?

     8           A   The document associated with that, yes.  The creator of

     9           that page would be the one that names that document as well,

    10           be it an individual or a corporate.

    11           Q   Okay.  Now, in the universe of cyberspace there is no

    12           central control mechanism that assigns names or Web

    13           addresses, is there?

    14           A   There is an organization called the Internik which has

    15           been discussed before in the Court which basically controls

    16           to keep any redundancy from occurring a master list of domain

    17           names and Internet protocol or IP addresses.

    18           Q   Well, all they do is simply make sure that there aren't

    19           duplicative names that are assigned, is that correct? 

    20           A   That's correct, yes.

    21           Q   They don't actually assign what the names are, is that

    22           accurate?

    23           A   That is also accurate, yes.

    24           Q   And so t here is no central control which orders that

    25           material of certain content should be labeled in a certain

                                                                            78

     1           way, is that accurate?

     2           A   That is accurate, yes.

     3           Q   Now, you indicated during your demonstration that the

     4           South Shores Secrets BBS had changed its server or at least

     5           that's what it indicated on them on screen, is that correct?

     6           A   That's correct, yes.

     7           Q   Isn't it possible, technically possible that that new

     8           server was located overseas?

     9           A   Yes, it is, that's correct.

    10           Q   Turning to your declaration, Mr. Schmidt, you indicated

    11           and you indicated in your answers to Ms. Heins' questions

    12           that you have had conversations with parents in which they

    13           have expressed some concern about their children's access to

    14           sexually explicit materials on line, is that correct?

    15           A   That is correct, yes.

    16           Q   And in your experience parents concern in this record has

    17           no relevance to the origin of the material, that is whether

    18           it comes from abroad or whether it is of domestic origin, is

    19           that correct?

    20           A   That is also correct, yes.

    21           Q   All they care about is what it -- what the content

    22           actually is, not its geographic origin, is that accurate?

    23           A   That is accurate, yes.

    24           Q   Now, in the course of your work on this case you tried

    25           several different kinds of blocking or screening software, is

                                                                            79

     1           that accurate?

     2           A   I -- yes, I loaded up three different sites, yes, or

     3           three different types, yes.

     4           Q   Now, Cyber Patrol was not one of those softwares that you

     5           tried, is that right?

     6           A   That is correct, yes.

     7           Q   You didn't try Cyber Patrol at all, is that accurate?

     8           A   No, I did not.

     9           Q   And with regard to Cyber Sitter is it accurate that you

    10           installed that on your machine but that you never used it?

    11           A   That's correct, yes.

    12           Q   So you never on any searches while Cyber Sitter was up

    13           and running, is that accurate? 

    14           A   That is accurate.

    15           Q   And is it also accurate that with regard to Net Nanny,

    16           you installed Net Nanny on your machine but that you never

    17           connected with the Internet while Net Nanny was up and

    18           running?

    19           A   That's also correct, yes.

    20           Q   So you never conducted any Internet searches while Net

    21           Nanny was operating on your machine, is that accurate?

    22           A   That is correct, yes.

    23           Q   In fact, the only blocking or screening software you

    24           actually ran, that is performed searches while the software

    25           was running is Surfwatch, is that correct?

                                                                            80

     1           A   Yes, it is.

     2           Q   So you don't have any knowledge of how effective any

     3           blocking software other than Surfwatch is in blocking

     4           sexually explicit materials on line, is that correct?

     5           A   Not totally correct, no. And may I explain?

     6           Q   Please.

     7           A   There recently has been some on-line studies of net

     8           blocking software conducted by some independent organizations

     9           in which the results have been posted on the Internet.  I

    10           recently looked at one and reviewed eight different packages

    11           and their relative strengths and weaknesses as displayed by

    12           the researchers that did that, that study on there.

    13           Q   But you have no personal experience, is that correct?

    14           A   That's correct.

    15           Q   Now, you have an AOL account, is that correct?

    16           A   Yes, it is.

    17           Q   But you have not tested the parental control mechanisms

    18           that AOL offers, is that correct?

    19           A   That's also correct, yes.

    20           Q   So you have no opinion on the -- no personal opinion

    21           based on your experience as to the effectiveness of AOL's

    22           parental control systems, is that correct?

    23           A   That's correct, yes.

    24           Q   And you either have or have had a Compuserve account as

    25           well, is that accurate?

                                                                            81

     1           A   Yes, it is.

     2           Q   However, you have not tested Compuserve's parental

     3           control mechanisms, is that correct?

     4           A   That's also correct.

     5           Q   And so based on your experience you have no opinion based

     6           on the effectiveness of Compuserve's parental control

     7           systems, is that correct?

     8           A   Yes, it is.

     9           Q   Turning to the exhibits that are attached to your

    10           declaration, Tab X, I believe, marks all of the exhibits and

    11           it's Exhibits 43 through 52 that based on your declaration

    12           you testify you were able to access while Surfwatch is

    13           running, is that correct?  And I'll give you a chance to take

    14           a look at it.

    15                    (Pause.)

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Except for Exhibit 42, you mean.

    17                    MS. KAPPLER:  Correct, your Honor, that's why I said

    18           43 through 52, in fact 42 --

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, you said it -- okay.

    20                    MS. KAPPLER:  In fact, Exhibit 42 is -- is not an

    21           on-line print at all.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  42 is the first one in Section X,

    23           that's why I say that.

    24                    MS. KAPPLER:  Correct, your Honor.

    25                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, from 43 on out, yes.

                                                                            82

     1           BY MS. KAPPLER:  

     2           Q   And these are locations which you accessed on April 5th,

     3           1996 while software was running on your machine, is that

     4           correct?

     5           A   I'm sorry, while what was running on the machine?

     6           Q   While -- excuse me, while Surfwatch was running on your

     7           machine, is that correct?

     8           A   That's correct, yes.

     9           Q   Okay.  Now, of all the other on-line images that are

    10           included as exhibits to your declaration, all of the others

    11           were accessed while Surfwatch was not running, is that

    12           correct?

    13           A   Yes, it is, that's correct.

    14           Q   And in fact no blocking or screening software was running

    15           while you accessed any of those other exhibits, is that

    16           correct?

    17           A   Yes, that's correct.

    18           Q   Now, turning to Paragraph 51 of your declaration --

    19                    MS. KAPPLER:  Which is on Page 43, your Honors.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Thank you.

    21           BY MS. KAPPLER:  

    22           Q   You indicate there, Mr. Schmidt, in your -- in the last

    23           sentence of that paragraph that in this limited check I

    24           simply look, I took the list of Web sites found in my prior

    25           unrestricted search and sought to find a few examples that

                                                                            83

     1           were not blocked by Surfwatch, correct?

     2           A   That is correct.

     3           Q   Now, by unrestricted search here you were referring to

     4           the fact that neither Surfwatch nor any other blocking or

     5           screening mechanism was running at the time, is that correct?

     6           A   That is correct, yes.

     7           Q   So is it correct to say that with regard to the searches

     8           that were conducted while Surfwatch was running, what you did

     9           was take Web addresses that you had found in prior searches

    10           and typed them in to see whether Surfwatch would block those

    11           specific sites, is that accurate?

    12           A   That is accurate, yes.

    13           Q   And the way in which you found these Web addresses was

    14           while doing searches while Surfwatch was not running, is that

    15           correct?

    16           A   That's also correct, yes.

    17           Q   And you already knew these addresses when you typed them

    18           in, correct?

    19           A   Yes, that's correct. 

    20           Q   And in fact you knew they contained sexually explicit

    21           material, correct?

    22           A   That is also correct, yes.

    23           Q   Because you had viewed them at some prior time?

    24           A   Correct.

    25           Q   Turning to Paragraph 47 of your declaration which is on

                                                                            84

     1           Page 40 and turning as it carries over onto Page 41, is it

     2           accurate to say that this location came up, and it's

     3           reflected I believe in Exhibit 44, by typing in that full

     4           name that applies on the third line from the top there on

     5           Page 41?  I don't know how many actual characters it is, but

     6           it starts with HTTP://PILOT.MSU on and on.

     7           A   Can I have a moment to read the entire paragraph in

     8           context?

     9           Q   Sure, certainly, excuse me.

    10           A   Thank you.

    11                    (Pause.)

    12           A   Yes, that is correct.

    13           Q   So you had to type in this entire name in order to reach

    14           the site, is that accurate?

    15           A   Yes, it is.

    16           Q   And this is  a name that you knew because you had found

    17           it in a prior search that you had done when Surfwatch was not

    18           running, is that accurate?

    19           A   That is correct, yes.

    20           Q   Now, looking at this name there is nothing in the name

    21           for the words in the name that connotes sexually explicit

    22           content, is there?

    23           A   No, there's -- it does not appear to be, no.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  In fact the domain name suggests

    25           that it's an educational institution, does it not?

                                                                            85

     1                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct, your Honor, yes.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sorry.

     3           BY MS. KAPPLER:  

     4           Q   But you knew that this site contained sexually explicit

     5           material because you had viewed it before, is that correct?

     6           A   Yes, yes, I had.

     7           Q   At that time you viewed it Surfwatch was not running,

     8           correct?

     9           A   Correct.

    10           Q   Turning to Paragraph 48 in which you indicate another

    11           site that you checked while Surfwatch was running that has

    12           that common name called, quote, "Steamy erotic links," close

    13           quote.  And if I can give you a chance to look over this

    14           paragraph and would you tell me if I'm accurate that this is

    15           the same location that you explain in Paragraph 19 of the

    16           declaration as to how you originally found this search?

    17                    And Paragraph 19 is on Page 17, looking back to Page

    18           17.

    19           A   That is correct, yes.

    20           Q   Okay.  And as explained in Paragraph 19, the way in which

    21           you found this site was you began by running the Lykos search

    22           engine and searching for the terms "XXX SEX," is that

    23           correct?

    24           A   Yes, it is.

    25           Q   And that's, just for the benefit of the Court and

                                                                            86

     1           everyone here, that would have been the similar type search

     2           that you were demonstrating using the Yahoo search only it

     3           would have been used -- a search engine only we're using

     4           Lykos and typed in XXX SEX to see what kind of listing of

     5           various Web sites would come up, is that accurate?

     6           A   Yes, it is.

     7           Q   And as explained in Paragraph 19, through linking through

     8           several sites off of that search engine result you came,

     9           finally came to steamy erotic links, is that correct?

    10           A   Yes, that is correct.

    11           Q   Now, Surfwatch was not running when you did this Lykos

    12           search, was it?

    13           A   The one referenced in --

    14           Q   Paragraph 19.

    15           A   That's correct, it was not running.

    16           Q   Okay.  And in fact if Surfwatch had been running when you

    17           did that search your entire results would have been blocked,

    18           is that correct?

    19           A   It would not have allowed the search, correct.

    20           Q   That is to say Surfwatch, if you had typed in XXX SEX

    21           while the -- on the Lykos search engine, a message would have

    22           come up saying "blocked by Surfwatch" and you would have

    23           gotten no listings whatsoever, is that correct?

    24           A   That's correct, yes.

    25           Q   So you would have got nothing in which to link off to to

                                                                            87

     1           find steamy erotic links, is that correct?

     2           A   Yes, it is.

     3           Q   Turning back to Paragraph 49 in which you talk about some

     4           of the other sites in which you typed in specific names for

     5           in order to see whether Surfwatch would block them, and

     6           Paragraph 49 is broken down into Subparagraphs A, B, C, D and

     7           E, and for the benefit of the Court I'm --

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Sorry what page?

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Page 42. 

    10                    MS. KAPPLER:  I'm sorry?  It's on Page 42.

    11           BY MS. KAPPLER:  

    12           Q   And just for the benefit of the Court and for you, Mr.

    13           Schmidt, what I'm going to try to do is go through the same

    14           exercise we just did to see where you found these links.  And

    15           I'm going to try to group them because I think it's easier to

    16           do that way.

    17                    Looking first at Subparagraph A and Subparagraph E,

    18           Subparagraph A, this is the subparagraphs of Paragraph 49,

    19           Subparagraph A you refer to a site designated as, quote, "PIX

    20           Previews," close quote, is that correct?

    21           A   Yes, it is.

    22           Q   And as you explain it there, you first found this site by

    23           linking off the Cyber Babes Web site, is that correct?

    24           A   Yes, it is.

    25           Q   And looking then down at Subparagraph E on that same page

                                                                            88

     1           you talk about a site called, quote, "The Alternative Page,"

     2           close quote?

     3           A   Yes, that's correct.

     4           Q   And -- excuse me -- and similarly that is another site

     5           you found by linking off of the Cyber Babes Web site, is that

     6           accurate?

     7           A   That is, yes.

     8           Q   Now, if you would turn, please, to Paragraph 25 of your

     9           declaration and that's at Page 22 and if you would take a

    10           look at it and just tell me if that is a description as to

    11           how you originally came to the Cyber page Web site or located

    12           the Cyber Babes Web page?

    13           A   I'm sorry, you said Page 22, which paragraph?

    14           Q   25.

    15           A   Thank you.  

    16                    (Pause.)

    17           A   That is correct, yes.

    18           Q   Okay.  And similarly here you did the search for Cyber

    19           Babes while Surfwatch was not running, that is when it's

    20           referred to in Paragraph 25, is that correct?

    21           A   That is correct, yes.

    22           Q   And while Surfwatch was not running that's when you

    23           located the Cyber Babes home page, is that accurate?

    24           A   Yes, it is.

    25           Q   And it was while Surfwatch was not running that you were

                                                                            89

     1           able to link from the Cyber Babes home page into both the PIX

     2           Previews and the alternative page, is that correct?  The

     3           other one isn't mentioned, excuse me.

     4           A   I'm sorry, I lost you somewhere and I apologize.

     5           Q   It was while Surfwatch was not running, as referred to on

     6           Paragraph 25, that you first located the Cyber Babes Web

     7           page, correct?

     8           A   Yes.

     9           Q   And it was while Surfwatch was not running that you were

    10           first able to link from Cyber Babes to the two locations that

    11           are then later referenced in Paragraph 49, is that correct?

    12           A   Yes, it is.

    13           Q   Okay.  Now, can you -- I don't think you can tell from

    14           your declaration but if you will look at Exhibit 23, doesn't

    15           that indicate that in fact the way in which you found the

    16           Cyber Babes Web page was through use of the Lykos search

    17           engine and typing in Cyber Babes?

    18           A   That is correct, yes.

    19           Q   And again the Surfwatch was not operating when you used

    20           this Lykos search engine, is that correct?

    21           A   Correct, yes.

    22           Q   Now, if Surfwatch had been operating you would not have

    23           been able to access this listing, would you?

    24           A   I don't know.

    25           Q   You don't know whether Surfwatch would have blocked Cyber

                                                                            90

     1           Babes, is that correct?

     2           A   That's correct, I do not know that.

     3           Q   If Surfwatch had blocked Cyber Babes you would not have

     4           gotten any listing when you typed in Cyber Babes, is that

     5           correct, you would have just come up blocked, you'd get no

     6           listing at all?

     7           A   That would seem correct, yes.

     8           Q   Okay.  

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Excuse me. Why didn't you know,

    10           cause you didn't try it?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct, your Honor, I did not.

    12           BY MS. KAPPLER:  

    13           Q   Turning back to Paragraph 49 on Page 42 and looking now

    14           at the other three subparagraphs -- I'm sorry, I'll wait till

    15           you get there.

    16           A   Okay.

    17           Q   The other three subparagraphs, that's Subparagraphs B, C

    18           and D, you refer to three different sites there, one which

    19           are called Honey Page, that's Subparagraph B, the second one

    20           is referred to as Amateur Hard Core and the third one as the,

    21           quote, unquote, "Fun Palace," close quote, correct?

    22           A   Yes, it is.

    23           Q   And in Subparagraph D you explain at least as to the Fun

    24           Palace, that's a site that you first found by using the Yahoo

    25           search engine for the term, quote, unquote, XXX, correct?

                                                                            91

     1           A   That is correct, yes.

     2           Q   And that's the search you had started to demonstrate with

     3           the Court at least briefly this morning, is that accurate?

     4           A   That is correct, yes.

     5           Q   Now, when you did this Yahoo XXX search as with this

     6           morning, Surfwatch was not running, is that accurate?

     7           A   That is also correct, yes.

     8           Q   Okay.  Now, turning your attention to Paragraph B, the

     9           Honey Page, you note that the exhibit that you produced by

    10           printing out Exhibit 50 is the same as identified as Exhibit

    11           11.  And I'll ask you to turn to Paragraph 14 which is at

    12           Page 12 and just confirm for me that that is an explanation

    13           as to how you originally found the Honey Page Web site?

    14           Page 12, Paragraph 14.

    15           A   Thank you.

    16                    (Pause.)

    17           A   That is correct, yes.

    18           Q   Okay.  And as described there and as demonstrated this

    19           morning, you found that site also by using the Yahoo search

    20           engine and typing in XXX, is that correct?

    21           A   Yes, it is.

    22           Q   And it was off links off of that search engine results of

    23           that search that you were able to find this Web page, is that

    24           correct?

    25           A   Yes, it is.  

                                                                            92

     1           Q   Okay.  Now, turn--

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Excuse me.  If you had just, without

     3           using the site address, if you had just typed in with

     4           Surfwatch running, if you had just typed in "Honey Page" or

     5           did you do that?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  No, I did not, your Honor.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  So we don't know what would

     8           happen if you did that?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  No, I don't.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Could I ask -- is it --

    11                    MS. KAPPLER:  Certainly, your Honor.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Just to follow this line, is there

    13           any instance referenced in your declaration when you came

    14           across what some of us might consider hard core pornography

    15           or material inadvertently without know-- without either

    16           putting in something like "adult" or "XXX" or without knowing

    17           in advance that you would get there by a link that went

    18           through some of this pornographic, sexually explicit

    19           material?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, there are, your Honor.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And in your declaration?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But that's the business with Jasmine

    24           and Beauty and The Beast, right?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor, that's correct.

                                                                            93

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And Little Women?              

     2                    THE WITNESS:  And Little Women, yes, your Honor.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  With those exceptions, all the

     4           other material you -- there was a -- was there always a

     5           warning or something maybe even there, I'd have to go back,

     6           that told you, that gave your viewer, a surfer the knowledge

     7           in advance that this material might be unsuitable for

     8           children?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor.  In most cases there

    10           was, as you say, some sort of a banner that --

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, that's why I asked, yes.  Go

    12           ahead, finish.

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, there would generally be a

    14           banner.  In some cases the banner would be underneath an

    15           image, a graphic image, and other cases would be strictly

    16           text on that page.  It depended upon the site which would be

    17           the case.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But it was always -- it would give

    19           warning just as when you walk into what's called an adult

    20           book store that certain kinds of material is displayed there,

    21           is that right?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct, your Honor, yes.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  

    24           BY MS. KAPPLER:  

    25           Q   Turning back, if we might, to Subparagraph C of Paragraph

                                                                            94

     1           49 which is on Page 42 which talks about the quote, unquote,

     2           "amateur hardcore site," and would you turn to Paragraph 17

     3           of your declaration which is on Page 16 and please indicate

     4           as to whether that explains how you originally found this

     5           amateur hardcore site?

     6           A   I'm sorry, which page was that?

     7           Q   It's Page 16, Paragraph 17.

     8           A   That is correct, yes.

     9           Q   And this Amateur Hardcore site like the Honey Page and

    10           like the Fun Palace, you originally found this Amateur

    11           Hardcore site by starting with Yahoo XXX search, is that

    12           correct?

    13           A   Yes, it is.

    14           Q   Okay.  So for each one of these sites you found a

    15           specific Web site address by doing a search without Surfwatch

    16           running, using the Yahoo XXX search engine, is that correct?

    17           A   That is correct, yes.

    18           Q   Had Surfwatch been running when you did the Yahoo XXX

    19           search you would not have been able to get any of these

    20           listings, isn't that correct?

    21           A   That is correct, yes.

    22           Q   Surfwatch would have totally blocked your search under

    23           Yahoo for XXX, is that correct?

    24           A   Yes, it is.

    25           Q   And then you would not have gotten any of these URL

                                                                            95

     1           addresses, is that accurate?

     2           A   Yes, it is.

     3           Q   Turning to the one instance paragraph you have in the

     4           section where you talk about images you were able to reach,

     5           able to find other than based on your earlier on-line

     6           searches, I believe that is, as Judge Dalzell was referring

     7           to, the ones that started at least with the Playboy Magazine. 

     8           And looking at Paragraph 46 of your declaration and it's on

     9           Page 40, that's where you discussed this magazine?

    10           A   Which paragraph was that?

    11           Q   Paragraph 46.

    12           A   Thank you.

    13           Q   Now, just so it's clear for everyone, it was certainly

    14           not clear to me when I first looked at these, Exhibit 42 are

    15           color Xerox copies of the April '96 edition of Playboy

    16           Magazine, the hard copy of the magazine, is that correct?

    17           A   That is correct, yes.

    18           Q   Okay.  This is the same magazine you can buy in some

    19           convenience stores or book stores or other places, is that

    20           correct?

    21           A   Yes, it would.

    22           Q   Okay.  These are not images that were downloaded from a

    23           computer, they did not come off line?

    24           A   That is -- well, let me qualify that.

    25           Q   Sure.

                                                                            96

     1           A   To the extent that whoever the author of this article put

     2           it together whether or not they had downloaded those images

     3           and the backdrop where it appears to be a computer thing

     4           whether they superimpose that or it's just screen shots, I

     5           have no knowledge of.  But these were the actual pages from

     6           that issue as depicted in the declaration here.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And if one of my colleagues, cause

     8           I wouldn't want to go and buy Playboy --

     9                    (Laughter.)

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  They would have this magazine,

    11           right?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    14           BY MS. KAPPLER:  

    15           Q   At least one feature of this April '96 edition of Playboy

    16           Magazine, the hard copy of the magazine and the one that is

    17           excerpted in your Exhibit 42, is a pictorial of nude or

    18           partially clothed women who have some kind of presence on the

    19           Internet, is that correct?

    20           A   Yes, it is.

    21           Q   And in the text that accompanies the pictorial it gives

    22           the URL or Web addresses of some of these, at least some of

    23           these women, is that correct?

    24           A   Yes, it is. 

    25           Q   And you took the addresses that were printed in Playboy

                                                                            97

     1           Magazine in this feature and typed them into the computer

     2           with Surfwatch running to see if they were blocked, is that

     3           correct?

     4           A   Yes, that's correct.

     5           Q   Okay.  And you were -- you typed in three different

     6           addresses, two of them were blocked by Surfwatch but one you

     7           were able to access even with Surfwatch operating, is that

     8           correct?

     9           A   Yes, it is.

    10           Q   Okay.  Turning to Exhibit 42 which is the actual magazine

    11           of Playboy and the fifth page, it's a page that has no text,

    12           has a pictorial, there's a blue background a woman who is --

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Page 5?

    14           BY MS. KAPPLER:  

    15           Q   It's the fifth page --

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Counted as, the cover counts as the

    17           first page?

    18                    MS. KAPPLER:  Yes, I believe so, your Honor.  It's

    19           the one that has a dark blue background, there is no text.

    20                    (Pause.)

    21           BY MS. KAPPLER:  

    22           Q   Now, this is the Playboy pictorial image of the model

    23           whose Homepage or Web address you typed in, is that accurate,

    24           and were able to access using while Surfwatch was still

    25           operating, is that correct?

                                                                            98

     1           A   May I clarify we're on the same page?

     2           Q   Sure.

     3           A   The one with the chain on the left-hand side of the page,

     4           is that correct?

     5           A   Correct, this woman has long dark hair, she's standing up

     6           facing the camera.

     7           A   Yes, correct, yes, that is the one.

     8           Q   Okay.  Now, turning to Exhibit 43 and there's only one

     9           graphical image or pictorial image in Exhibit 43, that is the

    10           image of this model that you could access on line while

    11           Surfwatch was running, is that correct?

    12           A   Yes, it is.

    13           Q   Okay.  And you would agree, would you not, that these are

    14           virtually the same photographs, are they not?

    15           A   It appears to be the same individual in a different pose,

    16           yes.

    17           Q   Okay, but it's the same setting, same clothing, is that

    18           correct?

    19           A   Yes.

    20           Q   And there are bare breasts in both --

    21           A   Yes.

    22           Q   -- pictures, is that correct?  Okay.  So the way in which

    23           you found this Web site was to have a copy of Playboy

    24           Magazine in front of you in which there were these pictorial

    25           images and then -- then also Web sites listed and then type

                                                                            99

     1           in the Web site and see a virtually identical image on the

     2           screen while Surfwatch was running, is that correct?

     3           A   Yes, it is, that's correct.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Just so I'm clear, so if Surfwatch

     5           is running and you have typed in "Natasha, Sex Goddess,"

     6           would it have blocked that image or don't you know?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  I did not try that, your Honor.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Does Surfwatch block material that

    10           has the word "sex" in it?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  It appears that it does, your Honor.

    12           BY MS. KAPPLER:  

    13           Q   So just so I understand relative to your testimony for

    14           this Court today, the concern is that a child would get a

    15           copy of Playboy Magazine and see these visual images and Web

    16           addresses and could type them in with Surfwatch running on

    17           the machine but still get access to virtually the same image

    18           on line, is that correct? 

    19           A   I'm not sure that that's my characterization.  My

    20           characterization is that this is what was advertised in the

    21           Playboy Magazine and this is what Surfwatch did not block. 

    22           As far as anything regarding a child having access, that was

    23           not part of what this is about.

    24           Q   But the only way in which you had access to that Web

    25           address was by the fact that it was in the Playboy Magazine,

                                                                           100

     1           is that correct?

     2           A   That is correct, yes.

     3                    MS. KAPPLER:  No further questions, your Honor.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Can I take you back?  I know you

     5           want to get up but I just want to take you back, before I

     6           forget your response to my question a while back.  And we

     7           don't have a -- well, we do have a reporter, but I think that

     8           I asked you because while I am keeping my finger in these

     9           pages, I had asked you whether there was any material that

    10           you came across inadvertently without explicitly looking for

    11           XXX or et cetera, any warning.  I think the warn -- leave the

    12           warning out.  And you said you did through the Jasmine, was

    13           it through that series of pictures that seems to be based on

    14           cartoon movie characters, is that -- is that what?  You got

    15           me into the Jasmine through that?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor, that was one of the

    17           sites, yes.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And those sites are primarily in

    19           your Exhibit 33, is that right?  Is that the material?

    20                    I don't have a young child anymore so I don't go to

    21           these movies anymore.  Okay, is that right, Mr. Schmidt, 33?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct, your Honor.  It

    23           actually starts at Exhibit 28 which is the results of a

    24           Webcrawler search for the phrase "Little Women" and just goes

    25           through that entire section in there.

                                                                           101

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, so while you were answering

     2           other questions, I went back to the text accompanying that

     3           and that appears on 33, appears about Page 29, your Paragraph

     4           33.  But I wondered when you were going to that, they were

     5           denom-- is it correct that they were denominated "Chips

     6           Erotic Tune" and "Adam" page, is that correct?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  That's the description in the upper

     8           left-hand corner, yes, your Honor.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, no, I mean -- oh, yes, you

    10           click back to the page and so that somebody looking for

    11           erotic pictures in the guise of children's movie characters

    12           would have either looked for it or would have known, that

    13           person would have known pretty promptly that this wasn't

    14           going to be the kind of picture that they show in school,

    15           that this was going to be a picture of a different ilk, is

    16           that right, by the word "erotic"?

    17                    THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry, your Honor, I'm not quite

    18           sure I follow the question you asked.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, I'm trying to figure out how

    20           inadvertent it was or how without warning.  What concerns us,

    21           I think, certainly me, is whether indeed one inadvertently

    22           comes, a child might inadvertently, really looking for -- not

    23           designed to look for this kind of hardcore material but who

    24           was just surfing looking for material that young children

    25           might look for, having seen the movie, wants to enjoy it, how

                                                                           102

     1           inadvertent would it be for that child to come across these

     2           pictures in the guise of cartoon characters.  And so I'm

     3           trying to get, to find out how inadvertent, did you just

     4           happen to be surfing and look for these?

     5                    THE WITNESS:  As far as the name, I specifically

     6           went on search for things that I think a child would be

     7           interested in, as pointed out.  If I may, your Honor, and--

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, but before you got to these,

     9           the child might have been interested but before you actually

    10           got to these, at that point was there something that let you

    11           know that this was material of a different ilk?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  Other than the description in where it

    13           says No. 25, "Chip's Erotic Tune and Adam E Page," you can

    14           see by the descriptions that some of the other responses on,

    15           looks like Exhibit No. 32, those search results do not

    16           specify, other than this one here, very much, the content of

    17           that particular page prior to going there.

    18                    For example, you'll notice -- and it's not an

    19           exhibit attached here, your Honor -- a number where it says

    20           37, there's a Jasmine?

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mm-hmm.

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Which would be the name I searched

    23           for.  That link is indeed a link that goes to an adult

    24           content Web site and that was one of  the ones that I saw by

    25           the search through this.  And there, other than the word

                                                                           103

     1           "Jasmine" you have no knowledge, clicking on Jasmine, what's

     2           behind there.

     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  See, I'm having the same, maybe

     4           part of the same concern that Judge Sloviter is expressing. 

     5           You said sexually explicit sites, you gave the opinion, can

     6           easily be found even if one is not looking for them.  Isn't

     7           it true that it's highly unlikely that you'll come across out

     8           of all the information out there that you're going to come

     9           across a sexually explicit site by accident?  I mean aren't

    10           the odds pretty slim on that?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  The odds, the odds are slim, your

    12           Honor, yes.

    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yes, really.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  If I may give you an example, this

    15           weekend on my own personal, I was looking for some movies on

    16           the computer to put as part of one of my teaching things.  I

    17           searched for the word "M-peg" which is the type of movies

    18           that are on a computer system.  The first site that came up

    19           said, you know, "M-peg videos," clicked on that and the first

    20           thing that popped up was a graphic image of two naked women

    21           engaged in a sexual activity and said "For more movies, click

    22           here."  And I was looking for something totally unassociated

    23           with that.

    24                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well --

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And didn't you just say to Judge

                                                                           104

     1           Sloviter that if you type in "Jasmine" and we get what's

     2           Exhibit 32 and then you keep pursuing cause you want to see

     3           Jasmine, you're a kid is your hypothesis and you want to see

     4           Jasmine, you just go into where it says just "Jasmine," your

     5           testimony is that that is a sexually explicit site?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct, your Honor.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  And I take it on the same

     8           exhibit, what's "Mermaid Mania?"  Is that sexually explicit? 

     9           Second page.  The third to the last.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  I did not click to that site, your

    11           Honor, so I don't know.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, so we don't know.

    13                    THE WITNESS:  I don't know.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Which one are you on?  I'm still on

    15           Jasmine.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No, 32.  32, you see Jasmine, and

    17           then on the second page, the third to the last.

    18                    (Discussion off the record.)

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  32, just so the record is clear, 32

    20           is what appears on the screen, correct?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct, your Honor, that's the

    22           search results.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And is it your -- are you telling

    24           us that all of these sexually explicit adult --

    25                    THE WITNESS:  No, your Honor, I'm not, no.

                                                                           105

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh.  Well, how did you -- I mean

     2           like "Jasmine's Lace Brokers," is that sexually explicit? 

     3           It's one, two, the third one down.

     4                    THE WITNESS:  I did not check that site, your Honor,

     5           so I don't know.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You just happened to come across,

     7           not knowing at all, is it your testimony that without knowing

     8           that you just happened to pick the one that happened to be

     9           adult?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  No, your Honor, I'm not.

    11                    THE COURT:  The euphemism for "adult?"

    12                    THE WITNESS:  No, your Honor.  If you'll notice,

    13           what I did was I clicked on one above it, "Jasmine's Home

    14           Page" and selected that.  

    15                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  You answered it, go ahead.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  And I clicked on Jasmine's Home Page

    17           and took a sampling of some of the things.  Obviously, the

    18           one that said "Erotic Tune," that one drew my attention

    19           immediately.

    20                    The other ones, for example, the other Jasmines

    21           listed there, I had saw a demonstration during one of the

    22           previous testimony about a search for a -- information on

    23           Fragile X, I believe it was.  I went and did a search similar

    24           to that and came up with a Jasmine which is what caused me to

    25           think about this Jasmine.

                                                                           106

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right, well, let me go back to

     2           my initial question because now I really am confused.  I said

     3           to you in all of this did you ever inadvertently come across,

     4           would a child sort of inadvertently or did you inadvertently

     5           come across any of this material.  And you said yes, there

     6           were some instances, and you took me to Jasmine.

     7                    But now I understand that you knew that there was

     8           within Jasmine something that might uncover Erotic Tunes, so

     9           that clearly how -- I go back to Judge Buckwalter's question,

    10           how inadvertent is this?  I mean there might be but how

    11           inadvertent from your standpoint, in your experience?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  It is possible, your Honor.  To the

    13           extent how many times --

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, not it is possible, your --

    15           your testimony.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Right, to my experience I have --

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Your experience, yes.

    18                    THE WITNESS:  I have --

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And in all of these exhibits was

    20           any of them truly inadvertent?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And which ones?  Where you didn't

    23           know it was going to be erotic or --

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, I understood your testimony

    25           that all these searches, Jasmine, Little Women and Sleeping

                                                                           107

     1           Beauty you selected because they were child-oriented titles,

     2           you had your suspicions, I suspect, based on your experience,

     3           but my understanding of your testimony is that you typed

     4           those in because those are things that a kid might -- might

     5           type in and see what comes out.  Do I understand your

     6           testimony correctly?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct, your Honor, yes.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

     9                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  We're really talking about the

    10           person who is on this without any suspicions, he's just

    11           searching geography in South America or something, it's

    12           unlikely he's going to come across --

    13                    THE WITNESS:  In that context, in geography South

    14           America, it's unknown, your Honor.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, well, we'll have our turn. 

    16           I'm sorry, Mr. Coppolino, but we had asked him that question

    17           before.  

    18                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, your Honors, if I may,

    19           I'd like to try and press on through and get this redirect

    20           done.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Sure.

    22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  It may take as long as 20 minutes.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We're in no hurry, okay.

    24                    (Laughter.)

    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Speak for yourself.

                                                                           108

     1                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION

     2           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

     3           Q   Mr. Schmidt --

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But we may have questions after

     5           you, so I mean I'm not saying that we'll necessarily be

     6           finished with Mr. Schmidt this morning.

     7                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I understand.  I know I'd asked the

     8           clerk to indicate a scheduling difficulty he has.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  He has to get to National Guard duty

    10           or something, right?

    11                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Right.  We can continue on Monday.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  This afternoon?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct, your Honor, yes.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What time is your plane? 

    15                    THE WITNESS:  My plane leaves National about --

    16           National Airport in DC at 4:30, sir.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So you have to leave here when?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  1:30, sir.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  They don't feed you on planes

    20           anymore.  Go ahead.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, you get peanuts.

    22                    (Laughter.)

    23           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    24           Q   Mr. Schmidt, you recall when Ms. Heins asked you if you

    25           were highly expert in sophisticated computer searches in

                                                                           109

     1           connection with your work.  Do you recall that question?

     2           A   Yes, I do.

     3           Q   Did the searches that you undertook in this case that are

     4           reflected in this notebook require highly expert

     5           sophistication that you utilize in your forensics

     6           investigations?

     7           A   No, they do not.

     8           Q   Do they require much expertise at all?

     9           A   No, they do not.

    10           Q   Are key word searches a common means of finding

    11           information on a computer, to your knowledge?

    12           A   Yes, they are.

    13           Q   Ms. Heins also asked you a couple of questions about

    14           various equipment.  My first question is are most computer

    15           monitors nowadays color monitors?

    16           A   Yes, they are.

    17           Q   And as we saw this morning, do the images on these

    18           monitors appear in color, is that correct?

    19           A   Yes, they do.

    20           Q   And to show the Court an accurate depiction of what was

    21           on the screen would you need a color printer in your opinion?

    22           A   No, you would not.

    23           Q   Now, to show the Court an accurate depiction of what

    24           showed up on a color -- on a color monitor would you at least

    25           need a color printer to show the Court what the colors were?

                                                                           110

     1           A   As far as the printed version of it?

     2           Q   The printed version.

     3           A   Yes, you would.

     4           Q   Do you know what the cost of a 28.2, 28.8 modem is,

     5           approximately?

     6           A   Yes, I do.

     7           Q   Could you give the Court approximately what the cost is?

     8           A   Anywhere from 95 to upwards to $300 but generally the

     9           average price about $159.

    10           Q   You had mentioned that you'd used a pentium computer to

    11           do these searches, is that correct?

    12           A   Yes, I did.

    13           Q   I believe you indicated that pentium is considered

    14           somewhat of a state of the art, is that correct?

    15           A   That's also correct.

    16           Q   Was a pentium computer necessary to do these kinds of

    17           searches on the Internet?

    18           A   No, it was not.

    19           Q   In fact could you have used a computer of the 386

    20           generation to do searches on the Internet, is that correct?

    21           A   Yes, I could have.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Which generation, 358?

    23                    MR. COPPOLINO:  386.

    24           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    25           Q   And about how old is the 386 generation, do you recall?

                                                                           111

     1           A   Oh, it's probably three to four years back.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  i.e. ancient.

     3                    (Laughter.)

     4           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

     5           Q   You also indicated to Ms. Heins in terms of your

     6           forensics expertise that you were -- you had expertise for

     7           example in extracting files from computers that had been

     8           erased, is that correct?

     9           A   Yes, I did.

    10           Q   And you also had expertise in examining files on a

    11           computer that had been altered, is that correct?

    12           A   That's correct.

    13           Q   Did you utilize any of that expertise at all in doing

    14           this investigation and making this presentation to the Court?

    15           A   No, I did not.

    16           Q   Ms. Heins also asked you some questions about the

    17           quantity of sexually explicit materials that are available on

    18           the Internet.  How many searches of sexually explicit

    19           materials have you been involved with in the course of your

    20           work throughout your law enforcement career that involved

    21           investigations into sexually explicit materials?

    22           A   Say somewhere between 30 and 50 different occasions that

    23           I'd conduct that type of a search.

    24           Q   And can you describe to the Court your capacity in those

    25           different types of 30 to 50 investigations?

                                                                           112

     1           A   Yes, in some of them I would have been the investigating

     2           officer involved, other cases I was the supervisor of those

     3           that did, provided not only management supervision but also

     4           technical supervision, other cases would have been as a

     5           consultant to other law enforcement agencies that requested

     6           some assistance.

     7           Q   So 30 to 50 investigations all told?

     8           A   That's correct, at least.

     9           Q   And did your investigations involve, for example,

    10           examining one particular graphical image?

    11           A   Some of them did, yes.

    12           Q   And what other kinds of investigations did you do?

    13           A   Other investigations of they would provide me 600

    14           different graphic images that had been found on a computer

    15           system and ask me to locate them out on the Internet, what

    16           the source might have been, bulletin board or Web site.

    17           Q   And how did you conduct these searches in order to find

    18           what you were asked to find?

    19           A   Using essentially the same search techniques I used here,

    20           I would go out and search for the adult content terms.  If I

    21           had a specific file name I might even search on that specific

    22           file name to see if I could locate it more readily.

    23           Q   And did you search for a range of sexually explicit

    24           materials?

    25           A   Yes, I did.

                                                                           113

     1           Q   Could you describe to the Court in general terms the

     2           types of ranges of sexually explicit materials that you've

     3           had experience in in searching in these 30 to 50

     4           investigations?

     5           A   Yes, some of them would have been the presumably

     6           innocuous Playboy centerfold types, things depicting

     7           simulated acts, actual acts all the way up to and including

     8           some of the more -- I use the term heinous type graphical

     9           activity that's out there.

    10           Q   So your investigations have covered the range of that

    11           kind of material, is that correct?

    12           A   That's correct, yes.

    13           Q   Now, in order to view images that are available on the

    14           Internet you need a computer, is that correct?

    15           A   Yes, that's correct.

    16           Q   Okay, that's what this case is about, images on a

    17           computer, is that correct?

    18           A   Yes, it is.

    19           Q   Okay.  And without a Webbrowser you can't surf through

    20           information on the World Wide Web, is that correct?

    21           A   There -- there is -- that's not totally correct.  There

    22           is -- you can do, look for textual information using a non-

    23           graphic interface but not to the extent where the World Wide

    24           Browser allows you to view the images and have all the

    25           graphics that we see on the screen. 

                                                                           114

     1           Q   You need a Webbrowser to do that?

     2           A   That's correct, yes.

     3           Q   Do Webbrowsers have search engines built into them?

     4           A   They have connections to Web sites that have search

     5           engines built in, yes.

     6           Q   In fact, we saw -- did we see an example of that this

     7           morning when you connected to the Yahoo search engine?

     8           A   We saw a couple examples, yes.

     9           Q   So is it correct to say that if you had the Netscape

    10           browser software you would not need to purchase separate

    11           software which constitutes a search engine, is that correct?

    12           A   That is correct, yes.

    13           Q   That Netscape had, the Netscape browser had the search

    14           engine, several search engines built into it, is that

    15           correct?

    16           A   That it connects to the search engine sites, yes.

    17           Q   And from there you could conduct the searches you showed

    18           us this morning, is that correct?

    19           A   Yes, it is.

    20           Q   Is it also the case, as I believe you showed us this

    21           morning, that the Netscape Webbrowser software has a capacity

    22           to allow you to search various news groups, is that correct?

    23           A   That is correct.

    24           Q   And that was built into the software of the Netscape

    25           Browser software?

                                                                           115

     1           A   Yes.

     2           Q   I believe Ms. Heins also asked you some questions in

     3           connection with the adult verification exhibits that you

     4           provided for the Court.  Did you produce those exhibits to

     5           provide the Court in examples of some of those mechanisms

     6           that are now appearing on the Internet?

     7                    MS. HEINS:  Well, I'll just object to the leading

     8           quality or the -- 

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I think he's trying to save time.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, I think, yeah.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  He's just trying to save time.

    12           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    13           Q   Do you recall the question?

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Go ahead and answer.

    15                    THE WITNESS:  And, yes, that's why I produced them,

    16           to give the Court the sense of what was out there that people

    17           are putting on the sites now.

    18           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    19           Q   Does your declaration purport to indicate that you are an

    20           expert in the precise details about how each one of these

    21           examples works?

    22           A   No it does not.

    23           Q   Are you aware of an increase in the number of Web sites

    24           that are sexually explicit Web sites that are advertising, if

    25           you will, or describing these various types of various adult

                                                                           116

     1           age checks?

     2           A   Yeah, there's been a fairly significant increase over the

     3           past few months of those sites that are saying, posting

     4           things such as Surfwatch and First Virtual and these type of

     5           information on the site.

     6           Q   An increase over the past few months?

     7           A   Few months, yes.

     8           Q   Let me just jump back to a question that I believe Judge

     9           Sloviter asked this morning during the demonstration.  When

    10           you searched for the term "XXX" in the Yahoo search engine,

    11           does Yahoo search engine search for that term in the text of

    12           the document, in the documents that are available?

    13           A   Yes, it appears to, yes.

    14           Q   And does it also search for the terms "XXX" in the URL

    15           heading as well?

    16           A   That's correct, yes.

    17           Q   So if XXX appears in the URL heading, is it your

    18           understanding that Yahoo would pick that up?

    19           A   Yes, it is.

    20           Q   And if the term "XXX" also appears in the text of the

    21           document that's being retrieved would the Yahoo also retrieve

    22           that document?

    23           A   That's correct, yes.

    24           Q   By the way --

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Would it be -- can I --

                                                                           117

     1                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Go ahead.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Would it be possible for one of

     3           these, all of the groups to say do not allow any XXX, any

     4           material such as that Mr. Coppolino just mentioned, to be

     5           shown, to block anything that says XXX?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, it would be as far as the viewers

     7           themselves, your Honor?

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.

     9                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, very similar to the way Surfwatch

    10           works where it blocks it out, doesn't allow you to see it.

    11                    THE COURT:  We heard it, yeah, I'm sorry, go ahead,

    12           Mr. Coppolino, all yours.

    13                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Thank you, your Honor.

    14           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    15           Q   Also during the demonstration we went to Exhibit 3 in

    16           your text of your declaration which was a warning screen. 

    17           Would you take a look at that, please?  

    18                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Exhibit 3, your Honor.

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Is that the one has "warning, warning,

    20           warning?"

    21           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    22           Q   That's the one.

    23           A   Yes.

    24           Q   "Sexvision" up in the -- "Sexvision" security shield up

    25           in the upper right.  Now, do you see the first sort of in

                                                                           118

     1           purple print says "Yes, I am over 18 years old and would like

     2           to access this," do you see that?

     3           A   Yes, I do.

     4           Q   Could anyone click that on once they reach the screen and

     5           get to the next image on the next page, is that correct?

     6           A   That's correct, yes.

     7           Q   You don't have to actually be 18 to press the mouse

     8           clicker to get to that, is that correct?

     9           A   That is correct, yes.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  By the way, if -- I know it may

    11           stretch credulity, but if a child were honest and said -- and

    12           clicked over no, I am not 18, what would happen?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  In most cases, your Honor, it would

    14           take you back to the search engine or the previous location,

    15           the same as using that back key would take you back to where

    16           you came from.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, sorry.

    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  And then you can go there again

    19           and press the other button, right?

    20                    (Laughter.)

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor.

    22           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    23           Q   With respect to the -- let's take a look at Paragraph 54,

    24           please, of your declaration?

    25                    (Pause.)

                                                                           119

     1           Q   Could you -- if you'd like to, if you'd refresh yourself,

     2           I'm going to ask you some questions on this.  Read as much as

     3           you'd like.  But my first question is have you ever advised

     4           parents that parental control software such as Surfwatch or

     5           Cyber Patrol or any other type of product by itself was

     6           sufficient to protect their children from access to sexually

     7           explicit material on line; have you ever given that advice to

     8           parents?

     9           A   No, I haven't.

    10           Q   Have you ever advised parents that closer supervision on

    11           their part would be sufficient to protect their children from

    12           discovering inappropriate sites on line?

    13           A   No, I haven't.

    14           Q   The circumstances of Paragraph 54, "In my opinion

    15           however, user-based controls, while commendable, will

    16           inevitably be trying to keep up with the addition of new and

    17           revised sites," what were you referring to right there?

    18           A   The fact is, as evidenced by previous testimony, there

    19           are a number of new sites being placed on the Internet daily,

    20           weekly, monthly and so it would be a constant battle trying

    21           to keep up with these sites and identify not only the

    22           addition of new sites but also the changing of names,

    23           changing of locations as we've seen through these earlier

    24           demonstrations.

    25           Q   The next sentence indicates that based on your experience

                                                                           120

     1           in law enforcement in this area which includes teaching

     2           classes to officers at beginner levels and also substantial

     3           anecdotal information from talking to parents about their

     4           children's use of computers, "In my opinion many parents do

     5           not have the same level of sophistication with computers as

     6           many minors do today nor the time to supervise their

     7           children's use of on-line computers."

     8                    Could you just describe for the Court in a little

     9           more detail your experience in meeting with and talking with

    10           parents or students you have taught which leads you to state

    11           this conclusion?

    12           A   Yes, I do quite a bit of teaching, once again, of law

    13           enforcement personnel, computer security personnel as well as

    14           public speaking in various forums.  And it seems a common

    15           thread through a lot of the either at break time or after the

    16           speaking engagement, parents will come up to me and say, you

    17           know: I'm glad I'm learning this thing because my kids know

    18           more than I do about computer.  I don't understand, you know,

    19           what they're doing, I have to rely on my kids to help me set

    20           up my particular windows.  And I hear that an awful lot

    21           coming from parents that they need to get smart on what the

    22           kids have on their computers and how to operate them.

    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  In another generation that will

    24           fade however from the picture, don't you think?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor, I do.

                                                                           121

     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay.

     2           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

     3           Q   Ms. Kappler, I believe, asked you a number of questions

     4           about various parental controls and measures, Cyber Sitter,

     5           Net Nanny, she asked you about whether you had checked out,

     6           if you had specifically examined those, if you had

     7           specifically examined the parental controls of Compuserve and

     8           America On Line, do you recall that question?

     9           A   Yes, I do.

    10           Q   Did you have the time in your preparation for this

    11           preliminary injunction hearing to examine every single one of

    12           those products?

    13           A   No, I did not.

    14           Q   With respect to Surfwatch, I believe the last part of

    15           your declaration contains examples of sites that were not

    16           blocked with Surfwatch running, is that correct?

    17           A   That's correct, yes.

    18           Q   Now, were the various searches you conducted that are

    19           reflected in the declaration without Surfwatch running

    20           designed to show the Court what could be accessed in an

    21           unrestricted environment?

    22           A   That is correct, yes.           

    23           Q   For the people who, for example, do not have Surfwatch?

    24           A   That is correct, yes.

    25           Q   With respect to the sites that you identified that were

                                                                           122

     1           not blocked with Surfwatch running, why did you test

     2           Surfwatch by typing in the site name?

     3           A   Well, a couple reasons.  First, during the demonstration

     4           in court by Ms. Duval in the previous instance, she talked

     5           about some of the blocking and I wanted to see if those

     6           particular sites were blocked, particularly from a

     7           publication that conceivably one could pick up a URL from and

     8           pass it amongst friends.

     9                    Traditionally, in those of us that use the World

    10           Wide Web on a regular basis, we find sites that may be of

    11           interest and swap that URL address just as one would say

    12           check out channel 7 at five o'clock because there's a good

    13           show that comes on every night.  That's a very common way to

    14           pass this information back and forth of sites of interest to

    15           us.

    16           Q   It's your understanding, Mr. Schmidt, that one of the

    17           methods by which Surfwatch blocks sexually explicit sites is

    18           to previously identify the specific site, is that correct?

    19           A   That's correct, yes. 

    20           Q   Did you type the specific sites in in order to test -- in

    21           order to test Surfwatch's site-blocking capability?

    22           A   That's correct, yes.

    23           Q   Does Surfwatch also block by key words, to your

    24           knowledge?

    25           A   Yes, it does.

                                                                           123

     1           Q   If a site has not otherwise been identified by Surfwatch

     2           and if a content provider has not used a sexually oriented

     3           term such as XXX or sex in its Web address, to your knowledge

     4           is it possible that that kind of site would not be blocked by

     5           Surfwatch?

     6           A   Yes, it is.

     7           Q   It would not be blocked by Surfwatch?

     8           A   That's correct, yes.

     9           Q   You were asked a number of questions as to whether or not

    10           with Surfwatch running it would be possible to access

    11           sexually explicit sites by a key word search.  Do you know

    12           whether or not sexually explicit sites can be accessed

    13           through a key word search with Surfwatch running?

    14           A   Depending upon the key word that's used, yes.

    15           Q   Have you ever done a key word search with Surfwatch

    16           running which resulted in hits and access to sexually

    17           explicit sites?

    18           A   Yes, I have.

    19           Q   Could you describe for the Court just some examples of

    20           the kinds of key word searches that you have done with

    21           Surfwatch running that resulted in actual access to sexually

    22           explicit sites?

    23           A   As I mentioned earlier, I recently was looking for some

    24           computer videos and that was one example where Surfwatch was

    25           running in the background, typed in the M-Peg and immediately

                                                                           124

     1           came to a site advertising it.  After the deposition the

     2           question was raised, I went back and checked some further

     3           sites using non sex-related terms like "pictures" and "women"

     4           and had access to some sites that once again that came up

     5           with photographic related topics as well as sexually explicit

     6           topics.

     7           Q   And those sites were not blocked at that time, is that

     8           correct?

     9           A   That's correct.  If I remember correctly, two of them

    10           specifically were on university sites, ADU sites.

    11           Q   With Surfwatch running?

    12           A   With Surfwatch running, correct.

    13           Q   Sir, to your knowledge is it possible to reach sexually

    14           explicit sites with Surfwatch running by using certain key

    15           word searches?

    16           A   Yes, it is.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And those -- those words were

    18           "women" and "pictures"?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Pictures, your Honor, yes.

    20           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    21           Q   Last question, there was also some questioning about

    22           foreign sites.  In the course of your investigation did you

    23           encounter some sexually explicit sites that appeared to

    24           originate overseas, is that correct?

    25           A   Yes, it is.

                                                                           125

     1           Q   Are you involved in any efforts to address the issue of

     2           sexually explicit site overseas by other countries?

     3           A   Yes, I am.

     4           Q   Could you describe that for the Court?

     5           A   Yes.  I'm an Executive Board Member of the International

     6           Organization on Computer Evidence and one of our charters is

     7           to deal with different aspects of computer crime or computer-

     8           related investigations in a broader spectrum.

     9                    We recently had our conference in Australia in

    10           February in which our representative to Interpol and Europol,

    11           an attorney from the Netherlands, this was one of the topics

    12           that was very greatly discussed because they're watching very

    13           closely the outcome of this case to see about them enacting

    14           similar legislation.  And obviously I'm not a lawyer but I

    15           know the term was used a number of times, "dual criminality,"

    16           where if it's a crime in this country, is the way it's

    17           explained, that it could be a crime in another country if

    18           that same statute exists as relates to some of the sexually

    19           explicit material and the distribution through the Internet.

    20           Q   So, Mr. Schmidt, based on the experience you have just

    21           described, do you have personal knowledge that other

    22           countries are examining the issue of the availability of

    23           sexually explicit site on the Internet?

    24           A   That's correct, yes.

    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, could I just confer for

                                                                           126

     1           one moment?

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sure.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Sure.

     4                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Thank you.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I want counsel to know that we're

     6           going to go until the questioning is finished with Mr.

     7           Schmidt, unless he's coming back on Monday or something, but

     8           otherwise we'll keep on going and if you have a low tolerance

     9           for lack of food, well, so be it.

    10                    (Laughter.)

    11                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I have no further questions.  Thank

    12           you.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Any redirect?  Recross?

    14                    MS. HEINS:  Just a few further questions, Mr.

    15           Schmidt.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    17                                RECROSS-EXAMINATION

    18           BY MS. HEINS:

    19           Q   I believe Mr. Coppolino asked you a little bit about your

    20           experience as a law enforcement officer searching the

    21           Internet for sexually explicit sites in connection with

    22           criminal investigations.  And again, this was -- these

    23           investigations involved potential -- sexually explicit

    24           material that was potentially illegal, is that right?

    25           A   It involved a broad range of materials, including that

                                                                           127

     1           type of materials, yes.

     2           Q   Well, you were involved in criminal law enforcement

     3           investigations, so am I correct to infer that you were

     4           primarily looking at material that might be illegal?

     5           A   Some of the specific images would have been considered as

     6           such, but I had to look at all the material that was out

     7           there in order to find specific images that related to the

     8           investigations.  

     9           Q   And I think you said that either as a supervisor or as a

    10           consultant or as an on line investigator, you've been

    11           involved in 30 to 50 such matters?

    12           A   Approximately, yes.

    13           Q   So, it's fair to say you've spent a substantial amount of

    14           time over the last decade looking at sexually explicit

    15           material on line?

    16           A   That would be fair to say, yes.

    17           Q   And in comparison, you haven't spent an equivalent amount

    18           of time looking, for example, at on line material that would

    19           be provided by libraries, is that fair to say?

    20           A   No, that's not.  I also review educational material, as

    21           well.

    22           Q   Well, you've done 30 to 50 investigations and you've

    23           spent a substantial amount of time on line in the area of

    24           sexually explicit material.  Are you telling me you spent an

    25           equivalent amount of time looking at on line material

                                                                           128

     1           produced by libraries?

     2           A   No, what I'm saying is I'd look at a lot of different

     3           material, including materials produced by libraries.

     4           Q   Right, but not equivalent to or even close to equivalent

     5           to the amount of time you have spent on line looking at

     6           sexually explicit material, isn't that right?

     7           A   That is correct, yes.

     8           Q   And you would give the same answer with respect to on

     9           line material having to do with the visual arts.  You have

    10           not spent an equivalent or close to an equivalent amount of

    11           time looking at that material on line as you have at sexually

    12           explicit material?

    13           A   That is correct, yes.

    14           Q   Now, most of the sites you've visited in connection with

    15           your investigation for this case, I think we've agreed were

    16           adult pornographic sites, is that right?

    17           A   They were adult-oriented sites, yes.

    18           Q   And most of these sites are commercial sites that after

    19           you have entered the home page and perhaps a few sample

    20           pages, cost money to go any further, don't they?

    21           A   I don't know that I could say that most of them were,

    22           because I couldn't always tell what type of site, whether it

    23           was a commercial site or in the first page that you got to

    24           see unless you went further.  Not all of them would advertise

    25           or ask for money initially.

                                                                           129

     1           Q   Okay, let me put it this way.  Most of these sites either

     2           asked for a credit card verification or some form of adult

     3           verification before going past the home page and perhaps, in

     4           some cases, a few sample pages, isn't that right?

     5           A   That's correct, yes.

     6           Q   They wanted you to become a member, right?

     7           A   That's correct, yes.

     8           Q   Okay.  Now, with respect to your claimed expertise on the

     9           subjects of parents' ability to supervise their children, I

    10           think you told Mr. Coppolino that this was based on parents

    11           who talked to you in the course of your public speaking

    12           engagements or appearances at conferences, right?

    13           A   That's correct, yes.

    14           Q   And this was therefore, a self-selected group of parents

    15           who had questions for you, is that right?

    16           A   I'm not sure --

    17           Q   That they selected themselves to come up?

    18           A   -- that's correct, yes.

    19           Q   You didn't conduct any kind of empirical sample of

    20           parents out there, these were people who came up to you and

    21           chose to ask you questions?

    22           A   That is correct, yes.

    23           Q   And it's fair to assume therefore that parents who had no

    24           questions with respect to controlling their children's

    25           computer use didn't come up and ask you those questions since

                                                                           130

     1           they didn't have any, right?

     2           A   Either that or they were too shy to come up, yes.

     3           Q   And again, you've done no formal research regarding the

     4           percentages of parents out there who may feel that they are

     5           unable to control their children's computer use, have you?

     6           A   No, I have not.

     7           Q   And do you have any basis for reason that -- for thinking

     8           that there's any substantial number of homes that have

     9           computers that were not bought by the adults in those homes

    10           as opposed to the children?

    11           A   No, I do not.

    12           Q   Parents generally buy computers for the home, rather than

    13           the child, right?

    14           A   I would think that's accurate, yes.

    15           Q   And the same would go for the printer?

    16           A   That would make sense, yes.

    17           Q   And the WEB browser.  And in fact, with respect to your

    18           own son, you supervise his computer activities, do you not?

    19           A   When I'm home, yes.

    20           Q   And you feel that you are capable of doing so, don't you?

    21           A   As far as capable of supervising him, yes, I do.

    22           Q   And you don't turn him loose on the Internet?

    23           A   No, I do not.

    24           Q   And although he's only 12 now, by the time he's 17, you

    25           feel that he'll have a sufficient basis of input from you and

                                                                           131

     1           from his life experiences that he would not be harmed even if

     2           he were exposed to even exploitative sexually explicit

     3           material on line, isn't that right?

     4           A   It's my hope that would be the case, yes.

     5           Q   And it's your belief that that's -- that that will be the

     6           case, isn't it?

     7           A   Yes.

     8                    MS. HEINS:  Nothing further.  Ms. Kappler?

     9                                RECROSS-EXAMINATION

    10           BY MS. KAPPLER:

    11           Q   Mr. Schmidt, Mr. Coppolino asked you a question about

    12           your understanding or about what is going on in terms of

    13           foreign countries treatment of sexually explicit materials on

    14           line.  Isn't it true that there are countries which are far

    15           more lenient in their treatment of sexually explicit

    16           material, that is, whether it is deemed illegal or not

    17           illegal?

    18           A   That is correct, yes.

    19           Q   And in fact, when parents come up to talk to you about

    20           sexually explicit material on line, you've advised them that

    21           in fact, there are sexually explicit materials that might be

    22           deemed illegal in this country which are perfectly legal in

    23           other countries, isn't that correct?

    24           A   That is correct, yes.

    25           Q   And Mr. Coppolino also asked you a question in which you

                                                                           132

     1           indicated that subsequent to your deposition, you ran some

     2           more general searches with Surfwatch running, is that

     3           correct?

     4           A   That is correct, yes.

     5           Q   This is where you were typing in a word within a search

     6           engine to see what kind of listing of various WEB addresses

     7           would come up, is that correct?

     8           A   Yes, it is.

     9           Q   And I believe the two examples you gave were pictures and

    10           women, is that correct?

    11           A   Correct, yes.

    12           Q   And Surfwatch allowed you to search for pictures, is that

    13           correct?

    14           A   Yes, it did.

    15           Q   It didn't block that, so in fact, you could look for

    16           things that related to in any kind of way to pictures, is

    17           that correct?

    18           A   Yes, as I stated, some of them were photography type WEB

    19           sites.

    20           Q   Do you recall how many listings came up when you searched

    21           for pictures?

    22           A   Not offhand, I don't know.

    23           Q   Well, do you have a rough estimate?  I mean, was it

    24           hundreds?

    25           A   I printed up a copy of them which I don't have with me. 

                                                                           133

     1           I could refer to it, if the Court would like at some point

     2           and give you that information.  But I don't remember offhand,

     3           no.

     4           Q   Well, can you tell me, was it -- it wasn't a small list,

     5           is that accurate?  Is that fair to say?

     6           A   It was a number of pages, considering 25 per page, it

     7           only went, you know, two or three pages back.  Conceivably

     8           say 

     9           100-plus links, but I have no absolute recollection of how

    10           many numbers are involved.

    11           Q   Okay.  Out of those, how many were links to sexually

    12           explicit sites?

    13           A   I think just off the first page I found one link that was

    14           connected to a sexually explicit site that was very -- that

    15           linked me to that site, which then, that site then it linked

    16           like STEAMIESRUS, in my declaration, it then linked to

    17           multiple, multiple links off of that one again.  And I think

    18           I looked at two of those in that process there.  And one of

    19           them, like I said, had multiple links off of it.

    20           Q   Okay, but all these others, you didn't look at all these

    21           others to see whether they were sexually explicit or not, is

    22           that correct?

    23           A   The titles of them indicated they were and plus the

    24           heading on the beginning, it says, here's some more neat x-

    25           rated sites and things of that nature.  But I didn't pursue

                                                                           134

     1           them all, no.

     2           Q   All of these listings you're saying --

     3           A   I'm saying all --

     4           Q   -- suggested they were sexually explicit?

     5           A   -- I'm sorry, all the listings off that one link that I

     6           checked, all those listings indicated that they were indeed

     7           sexually explicit material off that one link that I linked

     8           off of.

     9           Q   Okay.  But I guess I'm asking you, on the original

    10           multiple pages that had listings from what -- of WEB sites

    11           that related somehow to pictures, other than the ones you

    12           looked at, all of those other ones, as far as you know, do

    13           not have sexually explicit material on them?

    14           A   Yes, I understand you.  No, they had various titles and

    15           various pieces of information that did not indicate that.  

    16           Q   Okay.  Just for clarity's sake, for the record, do you

    17           have the copy of your deposition in front of you?

    18           A   Yes, I do.

    19           Q   If you would turn to Page 335 of your deposition

    20           transcript, there is a colloquy with Ms. Heins about your WEB

    21           Crawler search for Jasmine, the word Jasmine, which is what's

    22           referred to in Exhibit 32, attached to your declaration?

    23           A   I have that --

    24           Q   Are you on page?

    25           A   -- yes.

                                                                           135

     1           Q   Okay.  And you'll see at Line 4, Ms. Heins asked you, why

     2           did you pick the key word Jasmine?  And would you please read

     3           what your answer was?

     4           A   That's correct.  "Because one of my searches on line, I

     5           came up with the WEB site name Jasmine that related to some

     6           exotic, sensual aids and sex things and I was curious to see,

     7           in light of the fact that I have a child and I'm a Disney

     8           fan, to see what sort of responses I would get for searching

     9           for some common Disney character names that might relate to

    10           some Disney movies or some of the movies."

    11           Q   So, when you ran this broader Jasmine search using the

    12           WEB Crawler, you already knew that there was at least one

    13           sexually explicit site that used the word Jasmine, is that

    14           correct?

    15           A   That's correct, yes.

    16                    MR. KAPPLER:  No further questions, your Honor.

    17                    THE COURT:  Wait, wait.  Mr. Coppolino.

    18                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Just a very brief couple of points.

    19           I think one -- I should just clarify the record on one point.

    20                            FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION

    21           BY MR. COPPOLINO:

    22           Q  Mr. Schmidt, the search you were describing of women and

    23           pictures, was that one or two searches?

    24           A   That was one search using those two search terms.

    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Am I permitted or can I just ask one

                                                                           136

     1           more?

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes -- do we have ground rules that

     3           say he -- go ahead.

     4                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I just have one very brief question.

     5                    THE COURT:  Judge Dalzell has been setting the

     6           ground rules with counsel, if anybody wants to know why.

     7           BY MR. COPPOLINO:

     8           Q   Was your role in the investigation -- in the

     9           investigation you undertook in the law enforcement context,

    10           the development of facts for use by prosecutors and in court

    11           for a determination to be made by a court as to the legal

    12           status of the materials?

    13           A   That would be correct, yes.

    14           Q   You, yourself are not a lawyer, is that correct?

    15           A   That is correct, yes.

    16           Q   And you, yourself were not making those legal

    17           determinations, is that correct?

    18           A   That's also correct, yes.

    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I thank the Court.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You are a law enforcement officer

    22           and your vitae suggests that you do a great deal of the

    23           practical application of the law in connection with the

    24           obscenity investigations, correct?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct, your Honor, yes.

                                                                           137

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  And you are, I take it, at

     2           least passingly familiar with the statute that brings us all

     3           together in this case or these two cases, aren't you?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I am, your Honor.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, let's just -- I want you to --

     6            I want to take advantage of the fact that you are so

     7           experienced in this law enforcement area.  And I'd like you

     8           to assume a couple of things with me.  Assume that the law

     9           that brings us together is ultimately deemed to be

    10           Constitutional, okay, that the law is fine.  And that your

    11           job is that you now have to enforce that law, working with

    12           the U.S. Department of Justice, okay?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And let's assume that on two

    15           occasions, as you meet with parent groups, you also meet with

    16           content providers.  Okay.  And let's assume that you meet

    17           with one content provider group, which is a group of parents

    18           and concerned people about the spread of AIDS.  Okay?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And one group is in New York City

    21           and one group is in Brainard, Minnesota, which as you may

    22           know, is where Paul Bunyan is supposedly from.  And they come

    23           to you and they want advice because they don't want to get in

    24           trouble with you, because they know that they'll never meet

    25           Mr. Coppolino and his friends if they keep you happy.  And

                                                                           138

     1           they say we're concerned about teenagers getting AIDS and we

     2           have a WEB site, one in New York and one in Brainard,

     3           Minnesota.  And we have all decided that the only way to

     4           prevent the spread of this is we actually have to have on our

     5           site pictures of male -- of erect penises, to show how to put

     6           on a condom.  And both groups say to you, but I don't want to

     7           get in trouble with you, because these kids are all under 18. 

     8           What would you tell them?  And would your answer be different

     9           for the people Brainard than it would be in New York City?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  I think with those assumptions being

    11           made, I think my answer would be the same for both of them

    12           and look at the context in which that material is provided. 

    13           This appears to be an educational type context, not something

    14           done purely for pleasure purposes.  And on that I would say,

    15           put the adequate warnings in there so no one is surprised by

    16           this.  Make sure that information is pertinent to what you're

    17           trying to say.  But I would not, as a law enforcement

    18           officer, look to obtain material to go to a prosecutor with

    19           that type of information.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because of the context?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Because of the context, yes, your

    22           Honor.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Now, same question is, you're

    24           the publisher of Vanity Fair and you have all of your issues

    25           on line.  And the publisher comes to you and says Mr.

                                                                           139

     1           Schmidt, I've got a problem.  We had this very famous,

     2           controversial cover of the actress Demi Moore when she was

     3           pregnant and she was naked on the cover.  What do I do -- and

     4           it's all on line 

     5           -- what do I do now to prevent you from coming after me under

     6           the Communications Decency Act of 1996?  What do you tell

     7           them?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Once again, in that context, it's a

     9           visual image for fun, basically.  Not an educational -- it

    10           could be educational, but for fun more than anything else. 

    11           And I would tell them as well, depending upon the community

    12           in which that image could be viewed, that standard would

    13           probably apply towards the -- pursuant of the -- the rules of

    14           this law.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, it would be different in

    16           Brainard, Minnesota, perhaps, than New York City?

    17                    THE WITNESS:  That's quite possible, yes, your

    18           Honor.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And you'd tell them that?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  And I would tell them that, yes, your

    21           Honor.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, so what should they do on the

    23           Internet then, with their WEB site?

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Well --

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, not their WEB site, it's

                                                                           140

     1           already loaded in.  

     2                    THE WITNESS:  -- my recommendation is to, once

     3           again, in order to try to come up with some sort of a

     4           standard by using the same standard we used in law

     5           enforcement -- a lot of other things -- that's the reasonable

     6           person within that area.  If it's in Brainard, Minnesota, put

     7           those standard disclaimers, adult content, it may allow

     8           someone in the community that feels that's offensive to not

     9           have -- allow their children to have access to it, but the

    10           same token for those that don't find it that way, they can

    11           still have unlimited access through some sort of a user ID or

    12           a pass code or something along those lines.  They'd still be

    13           able to show it, but you'd have to go through, I guess, one

    14           more step in order to get to it in order to protect

    15           themselves.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, you'd advise them to put in a

    17           CJI script?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Something along those lines, yes, your

    19           Honor.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Could I just ask this question?  I

    21           have others, but I want to let Judge Buckwalter -- but on

    22           this one.  And suppose you were National Geographic and you

    23           were taking them through India and you came across some of

    24           your material that had all those couples copulating on the

    25           various Indian statues, what would you tell them in that

                                                                           141

     1           instance?  Not to put it on the Internet or cut it out of the

     2           travelogue?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Once again, based on my experience, I

     4           would once again relate that to that's an educational thing. 

     5           It's a cultural thing.  It's something that even though some

     6           people may find that offensive, that using that reasonable

     7           person that this is not something designed out there to

     8           create some sort of a problem.  It's something that's

     9           educational.  It's just a part of the life that goes on

    10           through that type of a magazine.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Go ahead.

    12                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, I'm not going to pursue

    13           that.  I'd like to pursue that, but I'm not going to.  One of

    14           the opinions you rendered here was that you felt that the

    15           user base controls would, in the long term, face attacks from

    16           those who may distribute information on how to disable the

    17           program.  I guess based on your many years as an

    18           investigator, wouldn't the same be true of any kind of

    19           content provider base controls.  Aren't they subject to

    20           somebody trying to disable them as well?  I mean, isn't this

    21           a constant problem of law enforcement?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct, your Honor, yes. 

    23           That is a constant problem.

    24                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I mean, there's no difference

    25           than between a -- in that area -- between a content based

                                                                           142

     1           controls or user based controls, is there?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  In that area of attempting for someone

     3           to disable, no, there would be no difference.

     4                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yes, okay.  That's all I have to

     5           ask.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  As an expert, when did the blockers

     7           first come -- when did you first notice the beginning of

     8           groups that were interested in being able to block material

     9           that they thought would be offensive to themselves or to

    10           children?  When did that first happen?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  I think I first started notic

    14                                 AFTERNOON SESSION

    15                    THE CLERK:  All rise.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Good afternoon.  

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Good afternoon.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I hope you are virtually, if not

    19           actually nourished.  

    20                    MR. MORRIS:  Good afternoon, your Honor, I'm John

    21           Morris, counsel for the ALA plaintiffs and somewhat out of

    22           turn, we are presenting Dr. Albert Vezza as our next witness,

    23           he -- next and final witness in this portion of the

    24           proceeding. 

    25                    ALBERT VEZZA, Plaintiffs' Witness, Sworn.

                                                                           145

     1                    THE CLERK:  Please state and spell your name.

     2                    THE WITNESS:  My name is Albert Vezza, V-E-Z-Z-A.

     3                    MR. MORRIS:  Plaintiffs would at this time move that

     4           Mr. Vezza's declaration, signed and submitted to the Court on

     5           April 9th, be accepted as his direct testimony in this case.

     6                    MR. BARON:  Your Honors, good afternoon.  Jason R.

     7           Baron for the Justice Department.  We do not object to Mr.

     8           Vezza's declaration being put into evidence, subject to the

     9           caveat that I will be asking Mr. Vezza questions regarding

    10           his technical expertise on PICs, as opposed to his general

    11           familiarity with PICs, during the course of my 

    12           cross-examination and his declaration will be submitted

    13           subject to his expertise as an expert on the areas that I

    14           question him about.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Fine.  Our rulings have been

    16           consistent on this matter.

    17                    MR. MORRIS:  He is now available for examination by

    18           defendants and the Court.

    19                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

    20           BY MR. BARON:

    21           Q   Good afternoon, Mr. Vezza.

    22           A   Good afternoon, Mr. Baron.

    23           Q   Would you please tell the Court what the W-3 Consortium

    24           is?

    25           A   The W-3C or W-3 Consortium is a consortium of about 130-

                                                                           146

     1           135 companies worldwide that have joined the consortium and

     2           the goal of the consortium is to further the protocols in the

     3           standards -- the de facto standards, if you would.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Speak up, please.

     5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yes.

     6                    THE WITNESS:  The de facto standards of the

     7           Worldwide WEB.

     8           BY MR. BARON:

     9           Q   And your declaration indicates that you are chairman of

    10           the Worldwide WEB Consortium?

    11           A   That's correct.

    12           Q   The consortium is comprised of a number of companies,

    13           correct?

    14           A   That's correct.

    15           Q   And Microsoft is part of it?

    16           A   Microsoft is a member of the consortium.

    17           Q   Netscape?

    18           A   Netscape is a member of the consortium.

    19           Q   America On Line?

    20           A   America On Line is a member of the consortium.

    21           Q   CompuServe?

    22           A   CompuServe is a member of the consortium.

    23           Q   Prodigy?

    24           A   Prodigy is a member of the consortium.

    25           Q   Could you look at Exhibit 167 in the binder that I've

                                                                           147

     1           provided to you and I believe binders have been provided to

     2           the Court, as well, of defendants' exhibits, starting at 167. 



     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Did you say 167?

     4                    MR. BARON:  Yes, it's a smaller black binder, your

     5           Honors.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Here it is, the black.

     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Sorry, I had it upside down.

     8           Go ahead.

     9           BY MR. BARON:

    10           Q   At the back of Exhibit 167, there's a listing titled

    11           members of the W-3 Consortium, it's the last three pages of

    12           the exhibit, do you see that listing?

    13           A   Yes.

    14           Q   And you testified at your deposition last Friday that

    15           this was a "pretty good list in terms of accuracy", correct?

    16           A   I said that it was, as of that date it was a pretty good

    17           list.  We try and keep it up to date.  I can't tell you today

    18           whether this list is accurate or not.

    19           Q   Okay.  Now, you would agree, would you not, that there

    20           are benefits to companies in joining the consortium, correct?

    21           A   There is one benefit.

    22           Q   And what is that?

    23           A   You get to sit at the table and argue about what and how

    24           the Worldwide WEB standards should evolve. But in point of

                                                                           148

     1           fact, we give everything away to non-members also.

     2           Q   In fact, at your deposition last Friday, you said that

     3           the benefit was and I quote, that's Page 18, Line 22, I'll

     4           just read it to you, Mr. Vezza, if it's okay.  "You get to

     5           sit at the table and discuss with all of the other members,

     6           the evolution of the protocols of the Worldwide WEB",

     7           correct?

     8           A   That's correct.

     9           Q   There are conferences and advisory meetings and workshops

    10           on the evolution of standards and protocols, correct?

    11           A   That's correct.

    12           Q   Some of the workshop topics have included security and

    13           payment issues, correct?

    14           A   That's correct.

    15           Q   And PICs, correct?

    16           A   That's correct.

    17           Q   We'll get to PICs in a few minutes.  You've had a number

    18           of payment workshops, including one in which VISA, MasterCard

    19           and Microsoft attended to discuss various ideas on payment

    20           mechanisms for credit cards, correct?

    21           A   That's correct.

    22           Q   In fact, on that specific topic, you told me at your

    23           deposition, that there are anticipated other ways of making

    24           payment on the net, including CyberCash, DigitCash and debit

    25           cards, correct?

                                                                           149

     1           A   There will likely be such ways of making payment on the

     2           WEB.

     3           Q   And work on protocols to enable those to occur is

     4           ongoing, correct?

     5           A   That's correct.

     6           Q   And the W-3 Consortium has frequently taken the lead

     7           and/or has made recommendations for the way certain protocols

     8           have evolved on the WEB, correct?

     9           A   Sometimes we lead, sometimes we follow.

    10           Q   And sometimes you make recommendations?

    11           A   And sometimes we make recommendations, that is correct.

    12           Q   The W-3 Consortium is currently working on furtherance of

    13           HTTP, the HyperText Transport Protocol, correct?

    14           A   That's correct.

    15           Q   And W-3C is working on HTML, specifically how to put in

    16           mathematical formulas into HTML documents, correct?

    17           A   That's correct.

    18           Q   And as I indicated before, W-3C has taken the lead on

    19           PICs, correct?

    20           A   That is correct.

    21           Q   Just as a preliminary matter, you agree, Mr. Vezza, with

    22           the proposition that standards are at the heart of the

    23           Internet, correct?

    24           A   Yes, they -- without standards we wouldn't have any

    25           operability.

                                                                           150

     1           Q   With respect to the Internet, if you don't have

     2           predictability, if you don't have a standard, then everything

     3           fragments, correct?

     4           A   That is correct.

     5           Q   And as a general statement subject to exceptions, you

     6           would agree that for the Internet, you have to have a

     7           protocol that suppliers and vendors, platforms and

     8           communication providers adhere to, so that there can be

     9           intercommunication on the Internet --

    10           A   Yes.

    11           Q   -- correct?

    12           A   That's correct.

    13           Q   It's also true, is it not, that the U.S. Government was

    14           heavily involved in the creation of the Internet, correct?

    15           A   Well, let's back up a minute.  I'm not sure that that's 

    16           -- they were involved, but all the people involved were

    17           technical people.  The fact of the matter is the Government

    18           funded lots of the work, early work on the ARPA net.  But it

    19           was the technical people in the university community and in

    20           the laboratories that did all the work of ironing out all the

    21           standards, okay.  The Government supplied the money, it did

    22           not mandate, do it this way.  

    23           Q   You're familiar with the Advanced Research Project

    24           Agency?

    25           A   I am very familiar with the Advanced Research Project

                                                                           151

     1           Agency.

     2           Q   And the acronym for that is ARPA?

     3           A   That's correct.

     4           Q   And ARPA funded the development of the ARPA net through

     5           the 70s and 80s, correct?

     6           A   That is correct.

     7           Q   And the U.S. Government has funded the IETF, correct?

     8           A   They have provided some funding to that, I believe, yes.

     9           Q   And the U.S. Government has funded the creation of the

    10           Internet Society, correct?

    11           A   That is correct, although lots of funding for the

    12           Internet Society now comes from private sources.

    13           Q   And the U.S. Government through the National Science

    14           Foundation, NASA and DOD continues to fund lots of work

    15           today, correct, on the Internet?

    16           A   It funds work associated with the Internet.

    17           Q   Indeed, the U.S. Government also supplied seed money to

    18           the W-3 Consortium itself, correct?

    19           A   That is correct.

    20           Q   ARPA gave 1.5 million for research to M.I.T., of which 50

    21           to $100,000 went to the consortium, correct?

    22           A   That's correct.

    23           Q   Now, your role at W-3C is that of chairman, right?

    24           A   Yes.

    25           Q   And what are your duties?

                                                                           152

     1           A   My duties basically are to make sure that we behave in

     2           the manner that doesn't get us into trouble with our members. 

     3           Okay.  It's very easy to do that.  We are -- we -- develop 

     4           pre-competitive standards software and we try and remain

     5           neutral to the industrial community at large.  And doing that

     6           requires some sophistication, both technically and

     7           managerially and executive-wise.  And that's my role.

     8           Q   You said at your deposition that your responsibilities

     9           would be for what "most people would call marketing", that

    10           is, your responsible for going out and explaining to people

    11           what W-3C does, correct?

    12           A   That's one of the responsibilities, yes.

    13           Q   You have a technical staff at W-3C that works on PICs,

    14           right?

    15           A   Yes, I do.  Not only at W-3C, but at other companies,

    16           also, have contributed heavily to PICs.

    17           Q   And Timothy Burners Lee (ph) runs the team that does all

    18           the technical work, correct?

    19           A   That's correct.

    20           Q   You don't consider yourself one of the technical experts

    21           on the minute details of PICs, correct?

    22           A   That is true.

    23           Q   And you don't purport to having designed any of the exact

    24           structures, of labels or exact structures of the syntax for

    25           servers that's used on PICs, correct?

                                                                           153

     1           A   That is correct.

     2           Q   And you don't claim that you could -- you could design

     3           these structures, correct?

     4           A   I don't claim that I -- I have better staff that can do

     5           it better than I.  I use them to do that.

     6           Q   In fact, you haven't designed any software related to

     7           PICs, that's not your function, correct?

     8           A   That is not my function.

     9           Q   And you haven't designed or constructed any software for

    10           the purpose of labeling documents on the Worldwide WEB or the

    11           Internet, apart from the PICs project, correct?

    12           A   Say that again, I'm sorry.

    13           Q   You haven't designed or constructed any software for the

    14           purpose of labeling documents on the Worldwide WEB or the

    15           Internet, apart from the PICs project?

    16           A   That is correct.

    17           Q   Out of all the documents that appear on the WEB site for

    18           PICs, involving technical specifications, you have authored

    19           only some "presentations", correct?

    20           A   Yes.

    21           Q   Would Defendants' Exhibit 174 be an example of one of

    22           these presentations.  If you turn to that?

    23           A   Let me clarify that.  This presentation, the graphics was

    24           done by someone at Netscape.  I crafted most of the language

    25           that went with it, with some help from the technical staff.  

                                                                           154

     1           Q   You had some input into this?

     2           A   Had a lot of input into it.

     3           Q   Now, you informed me at your deposition that the idea for

     4           PICs came up at an early advisory committee meeting of the W-

     5           3 Consortium around December 14, 1994, correct?

     6           A   That is correct.

     7           Q   And the idea was broached at that meeting about a rating

     8           system like the movie rating system, correct?

     9           A   That is correct.

    10           Q   And thereafter, in July of 1995, there was an article

    11           about pornography on the Internet and many of the W-3C

    12           members started calling up and inquiring about the idea of

    13           putting labels on content, correct?

    14           A   That's correct, but we were working on it before that,

    15           because we had a different idea about labeling.  I mean, the

    16           PICs labeling scheme is a general scheme.  

    17           Q   You told me that, "we've had it in the hopper as some

    18           activity", that was the statement you made at the time,

    19           correct?

    20           A   That's correct.

    21           Q   And there was a workshop in August, '95 where members of

    22           the W-3C set out in earnest to work out on developing the PIC

    23           standard platform for labeling content?

    24           A   Slight correction to that.  There were members of the W-

    25           3C team there, but there were also a number of

                                                                           155

     1           representatives from companies who were not members.  And the

     2           reason they were there was because we felt that they were a

     3           necessary ingredient in this activity.  That is, the content

     4           -- many of the content providers.

     5           Q   And it's your testimony, Mr. Vezza, is it not, that the

     6           issue of pornography on the Internet was and I quote, "one of

     7           the major reasons for going forward", with the PICs project,

     8           correct?

     9           A   It was one of the major reasons why our companies thought

    10           we should go forward with it, not the reasons why we thought

    11           we should go forward with it.

    12           Q   And you were going forward with it whether or not the

    13           July, '95 article came out, correct?

    14           A   That's correct.

    15           Q   But the article had the effect of speeding up the time

    16           frame, correct, for going forward?

    17           A   That's true.

    18           Q   The July article gave you a strong reason for

    19           accelerating PICs development, correct?

    20           A   It gave us a strong reason for -- it gave the companies a

    21           strong reason for asking us to accelerate.

    22           Q   Given the article, W-3C member companies that it would be

    23           a good idea for the industry to come together with a labeling

    24           scheme, correct?

    25           A   I would say that's a fair statement.  

                                                                           156

     1           Q   I'd like to turn to Page 56 of your deposition, which

     2           I've given you.  Let me read a statement from your deposition

     3           about what PICs is and ask you whether you agree with it. 

     4           It's Page 56, Line 6.  I will read the text in the six lines. 

     5           "PICs is a set of protocols which" -- this is your testimony. 

     6           "PICs is a set of protocols which allow a label -- a service

     7           to describe its labeling system -- that's one aspect of it --

     8            to a client or to the recipient of a communication.  It is a

     9           method by which, if all of the vendors adhere to the PIC

    10           standard, then all of the browsers that they develop will be

    11           able to understand a labeling system or rating system, if you

    12           will."  Was that your testimony?

    13           A   It goes on further, but I believe that that's the intent

    14           of it.

    15           Q   But that statement is accurate?

    16           A   Mm-hmm.

    17           Q   And if you turn to Page 58, Line 9, you were talking

    18           about the mission of PICs in your deposition and let me quote

    19           a statement and see if you agree with it.  You said, "If

    20           you're going to label something and you want a piece of

    21           software to take action on that label, the software has to

    22           understand what the label means.  And that's the mission of

    23           PICs.  Is it to allow the software at either a proxy server,

    24           an on line server, Internet access provider or the actual

    25           home computer to understand the label and take the actions

                                                                           157

     1           whether or not to allow the content to be viewed by the

     2           viewer or to block it."  Do you agree with that statement?

     3           A   Yes, but let me read the first part of it.

     4           Q   All right.

     5           A   I think that the sentence before it begins -- is also

     6           important -- a couple sentences.  I used the term browser

     7           understanding and I used it in generic form.  By that, I mean

     8           not only the browser, but all the software beneath it that

     9           accesses the Internet.

    10           Q   And why is that important?

    11           A   Well, because the -- the blocking may occur either in the

    12           browser itself or in some software underneath the browser

    13           that's the actual access port to the Internet.

    14           Q   If you could turn to Exhibit 174, this is the

    15           presentation I referred to earlier.  It is not my intention

    16           to have you walk through the presentation this afternoon, Mr.

    17           Vezza, I just have a couple of questions about it.  If you

    18           would turn to the page that says, ideally, at the top.  

    19                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Ideally?

    20                    MR. BARON:  "Ideally, children use the Internet with

    21           their parents."  It's six pages in.

    22                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  What exhibit are we on?

    23                    MR. BARON:  174.  Six pages into the exhibit.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Defendants' Exhibit 174.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.  I'm just commenting that we

                                                                           158

     1           didn't have this before.  This is new to us, right, these

     2           exhibits?

     3                    MR. BARON:  That is correct, your Honor.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, we haven't referred to this

     5           before?

     6                    MR. BARON:  That is correct, your Honor.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We just got it?

     8                    MR. BARON:  Yes.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, so we haven't been through

    10           it?

    11                    MR. BARON:  That's right, but this is impeachment

    12           exhibits for purpose of cross-examination.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I understand that.  It's just that

    14           --

    15                    MR. BARON:  We do intend to submit this particular

    16           exhibit with other exhibits in our case.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I'm not questioning the exhibit,

    18           I'm just saying that I don't know about my colleagues, but

    19           we're looking at it fresh and therefore, don't have -- I

    20           don't have anything intelligent to ask or question, but that

    21           may not matter.  It may not be even if I had it.

    22                    MR. BARON:  Well, if the Court desired at the end of

    23           the question, we could certainly walk through the exhibit or

    24           any other exhibits.

    25                    THE COURT:  Well, that's why -- that's the only

                                                                           159

     1           reason I asked.  But, go ahead, you conduct your examination.

     2                    MR. BARON:  All right, okay.

     3           BY MR. BARON:

     4           Q   Could you explain to the Court what this page, which says

     5           "Ideally, children use the Internet with their parents"  and

     6           the next page were purporting to represent?

     7           A   Purports to represent a child sitting with a parent

     8           making -- having access to the Internet.  And the next page

     9           says but parents may not always be present and children may

    10           run into an inappropriate material.

    11           Q   You told me at your deposition that with respect to the

    12           second page, we show -- well, with respect to these two

    13           pages, we show a child using the Internet -- this is Page 89,

    14           Line 7 of the deposition -- "We show a child using the

    15           Internet with a parent supervising and that's an ideal

    16           situation.  Unfortunately, that ideal situation is not always

    17           the case, very often a child is using the Internet without a

    18           parent's supervision."  Do you agree with that statement?

    19           A   Where is that?

    20           Q   You made it in your deposition at Page 89, Line 7.

    21           A   Line 7.  Yes.

    22           Q   Could you turn to a couple of pages after this in Exhibit

    23           174.  There is a scenario, one --

    24           A   Where?

    25           Q   It's three -- three pages after the last page we referred

                                                                           160

     1           to.  

     2           A   Yes.

     3           Q   Could you tell the Court briefly what this scenario is

     4           getting at?

     5           A   The scenario is getting at a parent using a system of

     6           Netscape and create -- or Microsoft Explore and creating a

     7           profile for the child, so that the child can only access

     8           materials that the parent deemed is appropriate for the child

     9           to see.  

    10           Q   If you look at the next page, could you explain what the

    11           box that's checked block unrated sites means in the context

    12           of this page?

    13           A   In the context of this page, the parent has decided that

    14           this ten year old child is not -- does not have the

    15           sophistication or the maturity to handle material that is --

    16           might have some sexual connotation, but that has not been

    17           rated yet and therefore, has checked block unrated sites, so

    18           that the only material a child will be able to have access to

    19           is that material which is specifically rated.

    20           Q   In a PICs --

    21           A   According to the child's criteria.

    22           Q   -- in a PICs compatible format?

    23           A   In a PICs compatible format.

    24           Q   And that's one way PICs works.  And PICs also works --

    25           that's correct, right?  One way it block all --

                                                                           161

     1           A   That's one way --

     2           Q   -- unrated sites?

     3           A   -- right.  And another way would be not to check that and

     4           if you look further on in this presentation for the 16 year

     5           old child, the parent has chosen not to check block unrated

     6           sites, because the parent has a feeling that the child is

     7           mature enough to know the family's values and how to avoid

     8           that material.

     9           Q   Okay, that's all I'm going to have with that exhibit. 

    10           Now, PICs allows a content provider to place a label on the

    11           content of a document, correct?

    12           A   That's correct.

    13           Q   And it also allows a third party to rate content,

    14           correct?

    15           A   A third party may rate content.  He may give it to the

    16           content provider or he may put it in a bureau.

    17           Q   When a content provider is rating his or her own content

    18           on the Internet, that's referred to as self-rating, correct?

    19           A   That is correct.

    20           Q   Now, it's your view that where a PICs label is put in a

    21           document is immaterial, correct?  

    22           A   No, I went back and checked the specs after my deposition

    23           and it appears in two places if it's put in the document. 

    24           It's either put in the HTTP header or it's put into MediTech,

    25           you're right, Mr. Baron.

                                                                           162

     1           Q   Let's look at Page 62 of your deposition, Line 7 and

     2           through 16.  And I understand that what you've stated just

     3           now -- let me give you a chance to read --

     4           A   Line?

     5           Q   -- that passage - from Line 7 to 16.  Let me read it for

     6           the Court.  "Answer" -- well, a question, "Could you describe

     7           the technical steps of where a label would be put?"  "Answer: 

     8           Where a label is put is immaterial.  All that has to happen

     9           is that when a client reaches for a particular activity, a

    10           particular URL and says, give me that content, that the label

    11           arrive at the client before the content or that the -- that's

    12           not even necessary, depending upon how the folks who build

    13           browsers decide to do it.  All that's required is that the

    14           label arrive at the Browser and the Browser examined the

    15           label and determined whether to show that URL -- the contents

    16           of that URL."  Now, aside from the tag or where it's put in

    17           the header and that is the rest of that passage, correct?

    18           A   Well, the issue here is whether or not it's attached to

    19           the document that's coming or whether there's a label bureau

    20           that supplies the label by itself.  In other words, you reach

    21           for the document and you say, well, wait a minute, go off the

    22           Label Bureau, get the labels for that document and bring him

    23           back.  And then get the document if the label is okay.'  So,

    24           that's what I was trying to drive at when I made those

    25           comments.

                                                                           163

     1           Q   Okay.  Now, with respect to is there content creators in

     2           the first way, the self-writing method.  The method of

     3           labeling may vary from place to place.  For example, Company

     4           A might automatically prompt you to label a page when you

     5           start creating it and place the label somewhere, is that

     6           correct, that's one methodology?

     7           A   Say that -- I'm sorry, I'm missing --

     8           Q   Well, you -- you testified that there were different

     9           methods of labeling for PICs compatible labels.  And one

    10           method, that is in your deposition, one would be where you

    11           might automatically be prompted to label a page when you

    12           start creating it and in a different methodology, a different

    13           institution might require the labeling based on a set of HTML

    14           creating tools, is that correct?

    15           A   Are we talking about -- I'm missing something here -- are

    16           we talking about creating labels when you're creating a

    17           document or are we talking about when labels come down to be

    18           read by a browser or the client software, to be interpreted

    19           as to whether or not to show that software?  I don't

    20           understand the question.

    21           Q   Why don't you look at Page 63, Lines 16 through 23 of

    22           your deposition?  Tell the Court what you were getting at

    23           there?

    24           A   What I was getting at there, in this instance here, the

    25           question was "How" -- let's look at the question.  I -- the

                                                                           164

     1           way I understood the question was how would labels be

     2           created?  And what I responded to here is that it's up to the

     3           people who create the software, who allow you to create

     4           documents for the Worldwide WEB or the Internet, as to how

     5           they will prompt you to create the label.

     6           Q   Okay.  

     7           A   And that's all I'm saying.  And it could happen, I mean -

     8           -

     9           Q   In a variety of way?

    10           A   -- in a variety of ways.

    11           Q   Right.

    12           A   And that each of the designs would be fine.

    13           Q   Okay.  PICs compatible self-labeling is not in widespread

    14           use today, correct?

    15           A   That is correct.

    16           Q   In fact, you don't personally know of anyone who has

    17           actually self-labeled their own site with PICs, as of today,

    18           correct?

    19           A   That is correct.

    20           Q   How many different ratings systems are possible in PICs?

    21           A   Many rating systems are possible, but I don't think that

    22           that will happen in the market place.

    23           Q   PICs doesn't rate sites on a single number or value,

    24           correct?

    25           A   That is correct.  In PICs, you are able to distinguish

                                                                           165

     1           between literature which might have some explicit content in

     2           it or just pornography.  In fact, PICs is general  enough so

     3           that you could use the Dewey Decimal System, you could use

     4           the Library of Congress system.  You can use any kind of

     5           system you'd like to provide a label.  And that's its

     6           flexibility and its power.

     7           Q   There are innumerable numbers or values possible under

     8           PICs, correct?

     9           A   That is correct.

    10           Q   The categories in PICs can be quite complex, correct?

    11           A   The categories in PICs are meant to differentiate

    12           subtleties in all of the material that's on line.

    13           Q   Can you look at Defendants' Exhibit 175.  It's a document

    14           that has a title, Rating Services and Rating Systems and

    15           their machine readable descriptions.

    16           A   Yes.

    17           Q   Do you recall my showing you this exhibit at your

    18           deposition?

    19           A   Yes.

    20           Q   And you had seen earlier versions of this document,

    21           correct?

    22           A   I have seen earlier versions of this document, that's

    23           correct.

    24           Q   Can you turn to Appendices -- well, look at A, B and C,

    25           but start with A?  It's --

                                                                           166

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Appendix A to Exhibit 175?

     2                    MR. BARON:  Yes, it's Page 7 of 12, at the lower 

     3           left-hand corner. 

     4           BY MR. BARON:

     5           Q   This is a hypothetical rating service called Good Clean

     6           Fun, correct?

     7           A   That is correct.

     8           Q   It is presented to be in PICs compatible format, correct?

     9           A   That's correct.

    10           Q   And the document says this is, "one of the simplest

    11           possible rating systems, using a single-category, minimum

    12           recommended age, we present the machine description for a

    13           fictional service that uses this rating system."  Do you see

    14           where it says that?

    15           A   Yes.

    16           Q   And that would be one of the simplest possible rating

    17           systems, correct?

    18           A   It's a simple rating system, that's correct.

    19           Q   You told me at your deposition that with respect to

    20           Appendix B, that you had a passing acquaintance with the RSAC

    21           rating service?

    22           A   Yes, I've talked to the folks there about it.  I talked

    23           to our own staff about it.

    24           Q   Could you explain for the Court what -- how this rating

    25           service works in terms of being in the PICs compatible

                                                                           167

     1           format?

     2           A   That the example here is in PICs compatible format, okay. 

     3           Now, I'm --

     4           Q   The number of categories.

     5           A   -- do you want me to go through line by line?

     6           Q   No, but there are a number of categories here described

     7           as values that you didn't put in PICs, right?

     8           A   Oh, sure.  There's -- well, let's look down, there's a

     9           lot of -- one of the labels is the amount of violence.

    10           Q   Well, why don't we go down to the bottom of the page

    11           where there is nudity and sex?

    12           A   Okay.

    13           Q   And there are label descriptions in categories, none or

    14           values 0, 1, 2, 3, correct?

    15           A   Yes.

    16           Q   And 4 on the next page?

    17           A   That's correct.

    18           Q   And they're -- different standards apply to the labels?

    19           A   And the different standards apply.

    20           Q   Okay.

    21           A   None is zero, revealing attire is number one.  Partial

    22           nudity is number two.  Frontal nudity is number three. 

    23           Provocative frontal nudity is number four.

    24           Q   And you told me that with respect to Appendix C, the same

    25           self-writing system you weren't familiar with that one?

                                                                           168

     1           A   I'm not as familiar with it, no, I'm not.

     2           Q   But looking at it, it does look like it's more detailed

     3           than Appendix B and A, correct?  In terms of the number of

     4           values assigned to the labels?

     5           A   Yes, in terms of the number of values, that's true.

     6           Q   With respect to -- that's all I'm going to do with that

     7           exhibit.  With respect to all of these ratings, PICs will

     8           allow a content rater or a third party rater to rate a whole

     9           site, correct?

    10           A   That is correct.

    11           Q   Or individual pages within a site, correct.

    12           Q   Or files.

    13           A   Or files.

    14           A   You can ave --

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What was that word?

    16                    MR. BARON:  Granularity.

    17                    MR. BARON:  Maybe you can explain it to Judge

    18           Sloviter.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Nobody else can -- everybody else

    20           can stop listening.  

    21                    MR. BARON:  And to the rest of us?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  We talk about granularity when we say

    23           if you're going to rate a site or a generic label for the

    24           whole site, then you should apply the label to that site,

    25           which is the most conservative label for the whole site.  If

                                                                           169

     1           you want to then go down deeper and label pieces of that

     2           site, we say that's more granular labeling and you can label

     3           a variety of pieces of that site.  In fact, you can label all

     4           -- every place where you can have an entry point you can

     5           label.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I mean, you could ultimately label

     7           every single word, so says Dr. Olsen.

     8                    THE WITNESS:  No, when we say label, what we mean is

     9           label where you can get at it by a URL or some entry point.

    10                    MR. BARON:  Only a select number of third party

    11           rating systems --

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Judge Sloviter thanks you.  

    13                    MR. BARON:  Thank you, your Honor.  

    14           BY MR. BARON:

    15           Q   Only a select number of third party rating systems out

    16           there -- there are only a select number at present, correct?

    17           A   Yes, there are, you know, half a dozen or thereabouts

    18           that I'm aware of, there may be more.

    19           Q   That you're personally aware of?

    20           A   That I'm personally aware of.

    21           Q   And you don't know how many sites have been rated out on

    22           the Internet, correct?

    23           A   I do not know at this time how many sites have been rated

    24           on the Internet.

    25           Q   It isn't very realistic that third party rating systems

                                                                           170

     1           can rate all of the sites on the Internet, correct?

     2           A   Depends upon really the business model the third party

     3           rating service is going to employ.  Some rating services, I

     4           anticipate, will employ people who will go out and do

     5           ratings.  And they will probably be interested in a certain

     6           segment of the Internet which they will rate very carefully. 

     7           There will be other parties who will make contracts with

     8           people and say, I will let you -- here is my criteria for

     9           rating, rate yourself.  And we'll sign a contract with you

    10           and we'll do spot checks and if you -- if the -- if you break

    11           my contract, I'll yank my rating from you.  Or I may even

    12           take you into court and sue you.  There may be some penalties

    13           associated with that.  If you take that kind of a business

    14           model, many sites can be rated.  Those that -- by a third

    15           party rating service.  And there are many business models

    16           that one could employ.  And I don't know which ones are going

    17           to flourish and which ones are going to be good.  But

    18           certainly, a lot of sites can be rated fairly rapidly under

    19           certain business models.

    20           Q   At your deposition last Friday, I asked you a question,

    21           "How realistic is the statement" -- this is at Page 128, Line

    22           16 -- "How realistic is the statement that, for example, the

    23           hypothetical rating service, Good Clean Fun, rates all the

    24           material on the Internet, how realistic is that?"  "Answer: 

    25           Not realistic."

                                                                           171

     1           A   That's Good Clean Fun.  That's a specific rating system. 

     2           We didn't talk anything about a business model.  Somewhere in

     3           this deposition I also pointed out to you that how many sites

     4           could be rated would depend upon a business model that a

     5           third party rating service would employ.

     6           Q   You agree with Mr. Bradner, who has previously testified

     7           in this action, that the Internet is doubling every nine

     8           months, correct?

     9           A   I believe I stated that it's possible, but that I

    10           couldn't -- I couldn't verify it.

    11           Q   And that the Worldwide WEB is experiencing phenomenal

    12           growth?

    13           A   That's correct.

    14           Q   The W-3 Consortium doesn't keep track of how many sites

    15           are being rated by third parties, correct?

    16           A   At the current time, we do not.

    17           Q   I asked you at your deposition, if you have 22 million

    18           URLs on the Internet covered by Alta Vista today and a rating

    19           service has rated 5,000 sites and you turned the blocking

    20           mechanism to the toggle where it's blocking all unrated

    21           sites, then you have effectively shut down 99 percent of the

    22           Internet, do you recall that question?

    23           A   I recall that question.

    24           Q   And you answered, "That's the user's choice though,

    25           that's me as the user, my choice to do that for my children

                                                                           172

     1           or my choice to let them see it."

     2           A   That is correct.  The parent can decide for the child

     3           whether or not he wants to block unrated sites.  The other

     4           aspect of that is that many of the sites that children would

     5           be interested in, would likely be rated very quickly.  The

     6           third aspect of it is there's lots of stuff out there that

     7           children don't care about.  I have tons of stuff on the WEB

     8           site at my laboratory at M.I.T. that would be of zero

     9           interest to children under the age of about 14 or 15. 

    10           Furthermore, I could go to any of the ratings services and

    11           say, give me a label, this is what's on it.  They'd probably

    12           give me a label for the site and we'd be done with it.  I

    13           don't think it's a big problem.  I mean, I think this is a

    14           start-up problem.

    15           Q   And you understand --

    16           A   It's not the -- it's a start up problem, it's not a

    17           problem in the long run.

    18           Q   Well, you don't dispute the notion that if there are

    19           5,000 sites rated today and they are 22 million URLs and

    20           you're blocking all unrelated sites in that option, you're

    21           blocking 99 percent of the Internet, correct?

    22           A   I don't dispute that.

    23           Q   Okay, let's talk about self-rating schemes.  Put aside

    24           PICs for the moment.  You would agree that it could be

    25           arranged to have a tag or a label put on a variety of

                                                                           173

     1           Internet applications, correct?

     2           A   Yes.

     3           Q   There's some generic tag that's possible for UseNet,

     4           correct?

     5           A   PICs is one of those?

     6           Q   The same for UseNet postings?

     7           A   Yes.

     8           A   And a standard tag for browsers to pick up for documents

     9           on the WEB could be created, correct?

    10           A   PICs is one of those tags.

    11           Q   And there are other tagging schemes that are possible?

    12           A   That's correct.

    13           Q   And the same for FTP, correct?

    14           A   That's correct.

    15           Q   Could be arranged?

    16           A   Yes.

    17           Q   And same for IRCs, correct?

    18           A   Yes.

    19           Q   In fact, if the attacking scheme was a simple four

    20           character set consisting of a label or a tag.  For the

    21           Worldwide WEB, let's stay on that.  The Microsofts and

    22           NetScapes of the world could reconfigure their browsers to

    23           pick up the four character tag in short order, correct?

    24           A   Not -- from my perspective, that's not a rational

    25           solution, it gives you --

                                                                           174

     1           Q   I didn't ask that.

     2           A   Okay.

     3           Q   I asked whether they could, as a technical matter --

     4           A   Was a technical matter.

     5           Q   -- was pick up the tag in short order. 

     6           A   Yes.

     7           Q   And your answer is?

     8           A   Yes.

     9           Q   In some cases, it could be hours or days, correct.

    10           A   Well, I don't know.  It would be depend upon where and

    11           how they would have to modify their browser and making the

    12           change is usually the simplest part.  Testing it is usually -

    13           - takes all the time.  

    14           Q   I just have a few more questions, Mr. Vezza.  If I didn't

    15           know the address or the URL for a platform for Internet

    16           contents selections home page, would you agree that one way

    17           to search for the PICs home page would be to type in the word

    18           PICs?

    19           A   That's one way of doing it.

    20           Q   And you could use any search engine to that?

    21           A   You could use a variety of search engines to do that.

    22           Q   You've used various search engines like Yahoo and Alta

    23           Vista in the past, correct?

    24           A   I've used mainly Alta Vista, but I've used Yahoo,yes.

    25           Q   You also told me at your deposition you've used WEB

                                                                           175

     1           Crawler once or twice, correct?

     2           A   I did not.  I am not familiar with it.

     3           Q   Well, you -- you -- 

     4           A   Where is that?

     5           Q   At Page --

     6           A   I said I know what a WEB Crawler is, I have not used that

     7           particular --

     8           Q   I think the -- it's Page 212, Line 14 -- Line 13, I

     9           asked, "Question:  You're familiar with WEB Crawler, though?" 

    10           Your answer:  "Not particularly, no, I may have used it once

    11           or twice, but I use hundreds of things."  Do you see where I

    12           said that?

    13           A   Where is that?

    14           Q   Page 212, Line 13, 14, 15.

    15           A   Line 12 says not that one.  

    16           Q   Well, I --

    17           A   Not the one I use, I use Alta Vista.

    18           Q   Line 13, "Question:  You're familiar with WEB Crawler

    19           though?

    20           A   I said not particularly, no.

    21           Q   No.  And then, I may have used it once or twice, but I

    22           use hundreds of things?

    23           A   Well, I may have.  I honestly don't know whether I have

    24           or not.

    25           Q   Would you turn to Exhibit 179?  

                                                                           176

     1           A   Yes.

     2           Q   Do you recall my showing you this exhibit at your

     3           deposition?

     4           A   I sure do.

     5           Q   Do you see the Line 48 or where it's numbered 048 down --

     6            this -- my representation to the Court is that this was a

     7           down loaded page, using WEB Crawler under a search-PICs.  Do

     8           you see where Platform for Internet Content selection is

     9           listed?

    10           A   Yes, I do.

    11           Q   And there are a number of other listings on this page?

    12           A   There are a number of other listings on this page.  

    13           Q   That's all I'll say on that.  Last question, Mr. Vezza. 

    14           At that time I deposed you last Friday, you did not recognize

    15           the name Donna Hoffman, correct?

    16           A   That is correct.

    17           Q   Or Scott Bradner, correct?

    18           A   That is correct.

    19           Q   You asked me, could you tell me who they are, correct?

    20           A   Yes.

    21                    MR. BARON:  That's it, that's all my questions.

    22                    MR. MORRIS:  Just a few questions, your Honor.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.

    24                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION

    25           BY MR. MORRIS:

                                                                           177

     1           Q   Mr. Vezza, on the question of your expertise, you're very

     2           familiar with the PICs specification, is that correct?

     3           A   Yes.

     4           Q   And to use Mr. Baron's terms, there perhaps are some

     5           minute details that you may not be familiar with, is that

     6           correct?

     7           A   That is correct.

     8           Q   But, with the specification documents, both the labeling

     9           specification documents and the rating service specification

    10           document, you are very familiar with those?

    11           A   I'm -- I'm familiar with the -- very familiar with those. 

    12           I've been through them the last few days.

    13           Q   Let me go back.  Mr. Bradner -- I mean, Mr. Baron asked

    14           you about a four character string and you indicated that that

    15           was not a rational approach.  Was there something that you

    16           had wanted to add?

    17           A   Yes, the problem with that is there is very little

    18           granularity to be -- for someone to express the fact of what

    19           this material is.  I'll give you the example and which was

    20           raised by the jurists here, that of showing something to do

    21           with AIDS and an erect penis.  You could, in fact, in PICs

    22           say this is educational.  Okay.  This is educational, this is

    23           what the educational activity is.  And a parent may be able

    24           to set up or would be able to set up a browser to discern

    25           that, so that in fact, a 15 year old would be able to down

                                                                           178

     1           load that information because it would specifically say this

     2           is educational.  Or in the case of the National Geographic,

     3           all of those things.  I was struck by the fact that you kept

     4           asking the previous witness, what would you tell your parent

     5           -- what would you tell those people how to deal with it? 

     6           Well, I mean if we have to -- if everybody has to go to an

     7           authority to try and get a decision about how to deal with

     8           material they want to put on the Net, we're going to have a

     9           lot of authorities making decisions like that.  Why don't we

    10           let other folks bring in a whole group of people that can

    11           help make those decisions.  And that's what the PICs labeling

    12           system is about.  It is to allow a lot of granularity and

    13           allow people who know how to do that to actually create the

    14           labels appropriately.

    15           Q   And the PICs specifications aren't limited to just

    16           labeling sexually oriented material, is that correct?

    17           A   That's correct.  The PICs specification are a general

    18           labeling scheme.  We looked at it and we said what we need is

    19           something that will deal with the Dewey Decimal System, deal

    20           with the Library of Congress.  Or deal with any other kinds

    21           of labeling schemes that we might think of in the future. 

    22           And that's what it's all about.  It's going to be used for a

    23           variety of reasons.  Whether or not it's used for rating or

    24           not, it's got a life of its own already.  

    25           Q   And so, if you hypothesize that there might be a desire

                                                                           179

     1           to label content by its sexual -- sexual levels.  And then

     2           there might also be a desire to label content -- a different

     3           content according to whether I dealt with racial issues or

     4           Nazism or things like that, PICs would be able to label -- to

     5           be used in all those situations.

     6           A   PICs would be able to be used in all those situations. 

     7           We have -- we have behind us the Internet community that the

     8           industry that's putting software out there to use PICs, we

     9           have evangelized this around the world.  I just came back

    10           from the Far East.  Jim Miller just came back from Europe. 

    11           We;re talking to all of those folks, they're all interested

    12           in the idea of labeling.  They are all interested in using

    13           this system.  

    14                    It has another advantage in that a rating system

    15           here in the United States could rate foreign sites according

    16           to the U.S. values.  And foreign sites could rate U.S. sites

    17           according to their values. If you -- if you go to some

    18           European countries, they think that our violence is

    19           abhorrent.  Okay, they just --they say how can you have so

    20           much violence in your pictures and what not.  So, I think a

    21           value is local and that has to be taken into account and PICs

    22           allows for that value to be local.  Q   Now, Mr. Baron asked

    23           you a number of questions about the block unrated sites

    24           option that the PICs specifications allow.  Would this option

    25           interfere with an adult's ability --

                                                                           180

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I would suggest you might get a

     2           little closer or talk a little louder.  Not too close,

     3           because it's --

     4                    MR. MORRIS:  Thank you, your Honor.  

     5           BY MR. MORRIS:

     6           Q   Would this option, the block unrated sites option within

     7           the PICs specification, would it interfere with an adult's

     8           ability to access content on the Internet?

     9           A   No, I mean, the adult could change it to not to block

    10           unrated sites and so they could access anything they wanted.

    11           Q   So, an adult would have access to the full range of

    12           content on the Internet?

    13           A   That's correct.

    14           Q   And would the block unrated sites option mean that minors

    15           could never, ever get access to unrated sites?

    16           A   No, in fact, if you go through the scenario, one of the -

    17           - one of the things in the scenario, the child says I need --

    18           gets to an unrated site, the child says I need this for my

    19           homework.  The mother comes back and gives the child

    20           permission.  So, in fact, with the child's -- with the

    21           parent's supervision, a child could get at it.

    22           Q   And under the block unrated sites option, would a parent

    23           be able to sit down with her children and access the Internet

    24           together?

    25           A   Yes.

                                                                           181

     1           Q   And in that method, they'd be able to --

     2           A   To control the situation.

     3           Q   And get access to the whole range of content on the

     4           Internet?

     5           A   That's correct.

     6           Q   Now, but with the -- if you -- if a parent were to turn

     7           the block unrated sites option on to activate that option and

     8           to block unrated sites, would the parent be able to protect

     9           their children from indecent or patently offensive sites that

    10           didn't have a label?

    11           A   That's correct, that's exactly what that option is for.

    12           Q   And this protection would protect United States citizens

    13           from foreign sites.

    14           A   That's correct.

    15           Q   Foreign content.

    16           Q   And that's under the PICs standard, a child could be

    17           protected form indecency and patently offensive material

    18           without any requirement that labeling be done mandatorily

    19           across the Internet?

    20           A   That is correct.

    21                    MR. MORRIS:  No further questions, your Honor.

    22                    MR. BARON:  No further questions at this time.

    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Here is a question.  You said

    24           PICs are tabs?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry?

                                                                           182

     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Are PICs --

     2                    THE WITNESS:  Are PICs tabs?

     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, are PICs tags, I'm sorry.

     4                    THE WITNESS:  Oh, no.  PICs are -- PIC stands for

     5           Platform for Internet Content Selection.  

     6                    THE COURT:  Right.

     7                    THE WITNESS:  It's a standard by which a rating

     8           service can express how they will rate things.  And it's also

     9           a standard for how labels should appear.

    10                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yes.  

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.

    12                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  And what are tags, then?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Oh -- 

    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I thought you said --

    15                    THE WITNESS:  -- that was a detail that Mr. Baron

    16           asked me about in my deposition as to whether or not a PICs

    17           label could appear in a Meta tag of an HTML document.  And I,

    18           it was late and I didn't remember and I didn't know and I

    19           said, no, I don't think so.  But in fact, he was right.

    20                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay.  All right, I --

    21                    THE WITNESS:  That it can appear there.

    22                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- I didn't quite get that

    23           exchange and I wanted to be sure I understood it.  The other

    24           thing you mentioned was about PICs will be, you said words to

    25           the effect, successful if all vendors adhere.  What's the

                                                                           183

     1           chance of that happening?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  Extremely high.

     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Mm-hmm, okay.

     4                    THE WITNESS:  Netscape is going to have PICs. 

     5           Microsoft has already announced that they are releasing PICs

     6           compatible explorer in June.  I can't believe that Netscape

     7           would be far behind.  In fact, Netscape may even beat them to

     8           the punch.  Certainly Spyglass will.  Spyglass -- both

     9           Netscape, Microsoft and Spyglass helped us with these

    10           specifications.  Most of the ratings services that I know

    11           that are out there, area already, Surfwatch, are changing to

    12           a PICs compatible spec rating scheme.  So, I think the

    13           chances are very high that --

    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay.

    15                    THE WITNESS:  -- it will all happen.

    16                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Thank you.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I mean, the reason is because there

    18           are enormously powerful market forces that are driving that,

    19           are there not?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And you know that from your meetings

    22           of the W-3C, right?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  I know that from the meetings of the 

    24           W-3C and I know that from the meetings of the people who keep

    25           urging us to quickly get PICs out and get it into the net.

                                                                           184

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, that they can say to parents

     2           like me, for example, who have small children, don't worry.  

     3                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Come on line with us, your kids

     5           won't see what's in Mr. Coppolino's book.  

     6                    THE WITNESS:  We hope so.  I mean, AOL is there,

     7           Prodigy is there.  

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We'll be forever now on this.

     9                    THE WITNESS:  They're all there.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, looking at Defendants' Exhibit

    11           167 and the members of the W-3 Consortium, am I correct that

    12           there is no Government member of that?  That is to say, no

    13           United States Government member?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.  They have a lot of

    15           input into the process, but there's not really -- they're not

    16           really members.  And I have to tell you the reason.  The

    17           reason is because we give everything away.  In our contracts

    18           with our members talks about how we deal with the

    19           intellectual property that we developed.  And the Government

    20           doesn't know how to deal with the way we want to give stuff

    21           away.  And when you have several members that want to be.  We

    22           have several Government agencies, can we be a member.  I said

    23           if you can sign the standard contract, you can be a member. 

    24           But they don't want to sign the standard contract, they want

    25           to give us a bunch of FARs (ph), which those FARs countermand

                                                                           185

     1           the standard contract intellectual property clauses.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  FARs?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Federal Acquisition Regulations.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  So, I am correct then and I

     5           asked Mr. Bradner about this when he was here.  You now know

     6           who Mr. Bradner is?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  I know that he testified.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, good.  That in fact, the

     9           Worldwide WEB is a creature completely divorced in its

    10           creation from any government, isn't that right?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Almost true.  Almost true.  The fact

    12           of the matter is Tim Burners Lee did it when he was a staff

    13           member at Cerne (ph), which is a particle physics laboratory

    14           in Geneva, which is funded by the European Governments.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  By the European governments?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  European governments, that's correct.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But Cerne is funded by it, but it's

    18           not an agency of any government?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  It's not an agency of a government. 

    20           In fact, there's a lot of United States participation in

    21           Cerne activities.  One of our faculty members from M.I.T. is

    22           a big player in the Cerne activity.  

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, so --

    24                    THE WITNESS:  And spends a lot of time there.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, in truth, it would not be fair

                                                                           186

     1           to say that with respect to the Worldwide Web  that

     2           Government has "nurtured it".  

     3                    THE WITNESS:  I think --

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  As in the sense of a mother

     5           nurturing a child.

     6                    THE WITNESS:  That is true of the Worldwide WEB.  

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  OKay.  Now, we have been told with

     8           respect to IP address blocking, okay.  That address blocking

     9           requires that the user's computer have stored on it's hard

    10           disc a list of all IP addresses which should be blocked. And

    11           then it goes on to say that the more you have on there, the

    12           more space you're using on the disk.  Ergo, the user will

    13           soon run out of disk space to block, true or false?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  I don't know what was being said by IP

    15           blocking.  Certainly PICs does not work that way.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, PICs would not use up all the

    17           disk space?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  It certainly wouldn't.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Why not?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Because the label could come with the

    21           document or it could be down loaded from a service.  It may

    22           be stored on a disk.  I mean, we admit that that can happen,

    23           but it's not necessary that happened that way.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  When do you estimate, as practical

    25           matter, the market will adopt PICs in a ubiquitous way.

                                                                           187

     1                    THE WITNESS:  I think that when Microsoft announces

     2           in June or they've already announced, but when they release

     3           in June, they will release an Explorer III with PICs

     4           compatible blocking software.  I think Netscape will be

     5           shortly behind that.  And at that point, it's been adopted.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I'd like to understand how it works

     8           from the -- again -- or mae more specifically, when you say -

     9           - when you say that the parent can say block all unrated

    10           sites.  And then in the colloquy that took place, the

    11           analysis was that all patently indecent sites would --

    12           patently offensive and indecent sites would be blocked.  But

    13           they would be blocked, would they not, along with everything

    14           else. And is there any way -- I mean, I'm not sure how one

    15           would pick out from the rating, sites that are patently

    16           offensive.  Is that what you suggested?

    17                    THE WITNESS:  No, I didn't suggest that.   

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I mean, is that what you were?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  The question went to what happens if

    20           you check block unrated sites?  What would happen then is you

    21           would block sites that did not come with a label or did not

    22           have a label to associate with him.  YOu would only allow

    23           information into computers that had a label.  

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, but all I'm suggesting is

    25           there is no way in which that you know of or through PICS,m

                                                                           188

     1           in which you can identify marginal material?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  Marginal material is always in the eye

     3           of the beholder.  And it's the person who's doing the rating

     4           that's going to decide what kind of a rating they're going to

     5           place on that material.  

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All I'm saying is when you block

     7           unrated material, you block it all?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's what I wasn't clear on.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Block all material that's unrated.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's right.  All unrated

    12           material.  Whether it is for children or --

    13                    THE WITNESS:  It could be pictures of ducks.  

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's right.

    15                    THE WITNESS:  You would be blocking them, too.  

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, that was my point.  That's just

    17           the point, there was in the colloquy some possible ambiguity

    18           that what you would be blocking was only material that was

    19           unrated that could be considered questionable?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And I gather that that's not what

    22           you're testifying.

    23                    THE WITNESS:  That's not what I'm testifying.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It's everything, no matter how

    25           innocuous, would be unavailable to -- once that button or

                                                                           189

     1           once that tag was pushed.  

     2                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.  However, if it were a

     3           child and the child wanted to see that material, he could ask

     4           his parent.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, no.  I understand that.

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's not the -- it was the

     8           technicality of what was being asked.  Okay.  Does counsel

     9           have anymore?

    10                    MR. BARON:  Just a couple questions, your Honor?

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Sure.

    12                                RECROSS-EXAMINATION

    13           BY MR. BARON:

    14           Q   Mr. Vezza, Judge Dalzell referred to enormously powerful

    15           market forces that are driving adoption of PICs.  If all the

    16           browsers in the world support PICs, then self-labeling with

    17           Pics would work, will it not?

    18           A   That's a complicated question and requires a complex

    19           answer if you'll allow me.  Self labeling, everybody labeling

    20           their own way is going to be chaos and I think everybody will

    21           recognize that. But self-labeling, according to some, a few,

    22           half a dozen, dozen rating mechanisms will work. 

    23           Q   And just to be clear, you were talking about how there is

    24           this drive towards adoption of PICS and PICs compatible

    25           architecture.  That adoption of PICS compatible architecture,

                                                                           190

     1           in terms of the market place, is a different issue and poses

     2           different problems than the actual rating of sites using PICs

     3           compatible architecture, correct?

     4           A   Repeat that?

     5           Q   First there's the adoption of the architecture. 

     6           A   Right.

     7           Q   But the question of rating sites on the Internet, on the

     8           Worldwide WEB, that's a different issue?

     9           A   That's a different issue and it's going on and it will --

    10            the minute there are browsers out there, there will be lots

    11           of folks that will be getting into the game.  And they're

    12           different business models will cause sites to be rated.  Some

    13           sites will be rated slowly by one business model, but more

    14           carefully.  Other sites will be rated very rapidly, but

    15           perhaps no as carefully.

    16                    MR. BARON:  That's all I have.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  This is a relatively unique and

    18           novel experiment in information, isn't it?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And with the exception of the movie

    21           rating system which has -- 

    22                    THE WITNESS:  It's a one rating system.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- which doesn't do anything at all

    24           like this because so simple in the sense to this.  There's

    25           really nothing out there, is there, that you can use as an

                                                                           191

     1           analog.  

     2                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.  In fact, we looked at

     3           the moving rating system carefully and said, gee, it will not

     4           capture the kinds of material that we'd like to have ratings

     5           posted to.  It will not capture the essence of literature. 

     6           It will not capture the essence of art, it will not capture

     7           the essence of education.  It just won't capture those things

     8           and this is one of the reasons why we have come up with a

     9           relatively sophisticated system.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But to work, isn't it so that there

    11           has to be a commitment to continue this indefinitely because

    12           there is material that will be coming on to the Internet and

    13           Worldwide WEB indefinitely.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  That's true, but we only have -- I

    15           don't know any other way around it.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And your point, I think, well, to me

    17           or Judge Sloviter was in a lot of sites, this issue is simply

    18           beside the point?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  If you're in the area of

    21           microbiology, I mean, if you were to raise this subject, I

    22           assume they'd look at you as though you're speaking Ordu or

    23           Sanskrit?

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Right, that's correct.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's totally irrelevant to them?

                                                                           192

     1                    THE WITNESS:  It's irrelevant.  I mean, you know,

     2           you could -- I deal in microbiology.  I have, you know, 500

     3           gigabytes of microbiology information here and you'll

     4           probably get a label that says microbiology and everybody

     5           will forget about it.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And much of those 22 million sites

     7           are of that nature?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Is that kind of information, that's

     9           correct.  That's exactly -- that's exactly correct.  I mean,

    10           I have tons of stuff at M.I.T. under my control that nobody

    11           would care about.  I mean, it's just not -- it's not relevant

    12           -- it's a rating and you just slap a label on it and it says

    13           this is what this is and be done with it.  

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, really maybe all material

    15           coming out of the science labs at the University of

    16           Pennsylvania, for example?

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, that would have a label that

    18           would just be say academic.

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Well, you have to be a little careful

    20           about that.  You noticed there were some EDU sites.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I sure did.

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Okay, so I'm not going to -- I'm not

    23           going to bite on that one that easily. 

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What you're saying is that for

    25           practical purposes was the exception of possibilities that

                                                                           193

     1           specific material may begin to draw and get closer to the

     2           line, that the -- well, you're, I guess answering my question

     3           is, that the amount of material that needs the kind of

     4           attention that would be required to be satisfactory is more

     5           limited than all of the material on it, but nonetheless,

     6           there would have to be some care.

     7                    THE WITNESS:  There is some gradation that has to

     8           take place in terms of that marginal material from -- not

     9           marginal to marginal to patently offensive.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, thank you.  Anymore?

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Anymore questions based on our

    12           questions?

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, thank you.

    14                    (Witness excused.)

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do you want to break now?

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, it's a good time to take a

    17           break.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right, we will break now before

    19           the next witness.  And I think counsel should be prepared to

    20           stay late.  If those -- some of you have trains, I don't know

    21           how long the next witness will be.  But if some of you -- oh,

    22           do you want to talk to them?

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, may I just see counsel briefly?

    24                    (Court in recess at 3:05 o'clock p.m.)

    25                    (The following occurred at 3:25 p.m.)

                                                                           194

     1                    DEPUTY CLERK HIGGINS:  Court is now in session. 

     2           Please be seated.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, does the Government have Dr.

     4           Olsen for us?

     5                    MR. BARON:  At this time, your Honors, we call Dr.

     6           Dan Olsen, Jr. to the stand.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What's the timing?  Until what time

     8           is he available till, quarter after 5:00?

     9                    MR. BARON:  Yes.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Remember, it's Friday afternoon, so

    11           you have to --

    12                    MR. BARON:  He's taking a taxi to the airport and

    13           6:30 is his plane.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  He'll be in good shape.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, you still have to be able to

    16           get there, physically, taxi or not.

    17                    DAN OLSEN, Sworn.

    18                    DEPUTY CLERK HIGGINS:  Please be seated.  Please

    19           state and spell your name.

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Dan Olsen, O-L-S-E-N.

    21                    MR. BARON:  At this time, your Honors, we offer Dr.

    22           Olsen's declaration into evidence.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is there any objection?

    24                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honors, there is an objection.  We

    25           do not in general object to Dr. Olsen's qualifications, and

                                                                           195

     1           we understand the Court has been generous in receiving

     2           testimony.  But based on his specific admissions during his

     3           deposition, there are five discrete areas in which we do

     4           contest his expertise, and I would appreciate an opportunity

     5           for a brief voir dire limited to those deposition questions.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sure.

     7                    MR. ENNIS:  First, your Honors, we contest the

     8           expertise of Dr. Olsen regarding Surfwatch, Cyber Patrol, Net

     9           Nanny and similar end-user blocking software.  

    10                               VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION

    11           BY MR. ENNIS:

    12           Q   Dr. Olsen, is it true that you have never installed or

    13           run Surfwatch or Cyber Patrol or Net Nanny?

    14           A   I did not use the specific applications.  My

    15           understanding of what was done there was based on analysis of

    16           the required algorithms.

    17           Q   Is it basically fair to say that you have read their Web

    18           pages?

    19           A   I have read the Web pages and considered carefully what

    20           the underlying algorithms necessary to accomplish the goals

    21           are.

    22           Q   And have you primarily read those Web pages and learned

    23           what you've learned about them since you were retained by the

    24           Department of Justice in this litigation?

    25           A   With regard to specific products I have considered those

                                                                           196

     1           pages in the past but not extensively.  However, I have done

     2           some work on exactly what the algorithms necessary to do that

     3           would be.

     4           Q   Have you read the Web pages since you were retained in

     5           mid March of this year?

     6           A   Yes.

     7           Q   We also -- you've never conducted any independent studies

     8           of Surfwatch, Cyber Patrol or Net Nanny, have you?

     9           A   I have not.

    10           Q   And not personally run them yourself?

    11           A   I have not.

    12                    MR. ENNIS:  The second area is parental control

    13           technologies employed by America Online, Compuserve, Prodigy

    14           and Microsoft Network, including whether the tagging system

    15           Dr. Olsen proposes would work in those closed communities.

    16           BY MR. ENNIS:

    17           Q   Dr. Olsen, is it fair to say other than cursory notice of

    18           AOL announcements recently, you have no knowledge of AOL's

    19           parental technologies, and you have not subscribed to or used

    20           Prodigy, Compuserve or Microsoft Network?

    21           A   That is correct.

    22           Q   Is it also fair to say that at least as of your

    23           deposition Tuesday you did not know whether the tagging

    24           system you propose in your declaration would work within AOL,

    25           Compuserve, Prodigy or Microsoft Network within their closed

                                                                           197

     1           communities?

     2           A   I do not know whether that tagging system would work. 

     3           However, I do understand some characteristics of what they do

     4           that is relevant to my declaration.

     5                    MR. ENNIS:  The third area in which we contest Dr.

     6           Olsen's expertise is with respect to either direct or third

     7           party verification of credit cards, including the technology

     8           of verification, the costs of verification and the types of

     9           transactions that would be verified.  

    10           BY MR. ENNIS:

    11           Q   Again, Dr. Olsen, with respect to that subject matter, is

    12           it fair to say that you have just simply read the Web pages

    13           of MasterCard and Visa since being retained in this

    14           litigation?

    15           A   I would have no technical knowledge of what MasterCard

    16           and Visa do.

    17           Q   Is it fair that you've just read their Web pages?

    18           A   That is correct.

    19           Q   And since being retained --

    20           A   That is correct.

    21           Q   -- you've had no discussions with personnel at MasterCard

    22           or Visa?

    23           A   I have not.

    24           Q   And I believe you just said you have no expertise in the

    25           technology of credit card verification.

                                                                           198

     1           A   The technology of what MasterCard and Visa themselves do,

     2           I have looked some at verification.

     3           Q   You have no idea what they would charge to verify for

     4           commercial transactions?

     5           A   I cannot say what they would charge.

     6           Q   And I take it you don't even know whether they would

     7           verify for a noncommercial transaction, that is, for a

     8           speaker who wanted to provide his speech for free?

     9           A   I would have no useful knowledge.

    10           Q   Now, with respect to third party verification systems, is

    11           it also fair to say that you have only looked at the Web

    12           pages of those third party verification systems since being

    13           retained in this litigation?

    14           A   Clarify what you mean by a third party verification

    15           system.

    16           Q   Other systems that will themselves go to MasterCard or

    17           Visa and obtain verification of credit card information,

    18           adult ID check systems --

    19           A   Oh, adult ID as to what they -- I have read their Web

    20           pages and I have studied some of their technical documents.

    21           Q   And that's again since being retained in this litigation?

    22           A   That is correct.

    23           Q   Have you interviewed anyone at those third party

    24           verification systems?

    25           A   No.

                                                                           199

     1           Q   Have you interviewed any speakers who have used those

     2           third party verification systems?

     3           A   I have not.

     4           Q   Have you ever used those systems yourself?

     5           A   I have not.

     6           Q   Do you have any idea how many people are registered with

     7           those systems?

     8           A   I do not.

     9           Q   Could be one, could be 1,000, could be 500, you have no

    10           idea?

    11           A   I have no idea.

    12           Q   Is it fair to say that you don't know how the "referral

    13           technology" between a third party verification system and a

    14           speaker would work, and you're foggy about how the third

    15           party obtains verification; is that fair?

    16           A   No.  Referral technology, please clarify that.

    17           Q   Well, would you look, please, at pages 247 to 249 of your

    18           deposition transcript which we took last Tuesday.  I'm using

    19           the phrase you used there.

    20                    Have you located those pages?

    21           A   247?

    22           Q   Right.  And you were asked the question, "Okay, what

    23           happens when John comes to my site?  

    24                    "Answer:  Okay.  My understanding is that somehow,

    25           and I would have to check the details, is that initially he

                                                                           200

     1           not having a password would be referred to adult check for

     2           which he would pay whatever it was and then be referred back. 

     3           How that referral technology works, I can't say right now. 

     4           I'd have to look at the detail."

     5                    And then you say further down, "Question:  Okay. 

     6           Now, how does that work?

     7                    "Answer:  As I remember the technology there, IC

     8           Verify provides -- I believe it is a PC-based system, but

     9           they may have mentioned Unix (ph), I'm foggy there, whereby a

    10           phone line is connected to your machine or multiple phone

    11           lines, and then software makes the request.  A call gets made

    12           to MasterCard, whoever they're connected to or the bank,

    13           however they do that, and a charge gets processed."

    14                    Do you recall that question and that answer?

    15           A   Yes, I do.

    16           Q   Does that -- since you used the phrase "referral

    17           technology," what does it mean in that context?

    18           A   Referral -- excuse me.  Referral technology as I

    19           mentioned it there on page 248 has to do with when someone

    20           arrives at a site that would like to be verified, say by

    21           Adult Check or Validate, they are transferred back to the

    22           Adult Check site.  They do that by means of code.  They have

    23           the original people who want to be blocked, they have to put

    24           that code into their HTML pages.  Now, the details of exactly

    25           what the syntax is without again looking at the spec I could

                                                                           201

     1           not quote to you, but the substantive nature of exactly how

     2           that mechanism works, I do understand that clearly.

     3                    MR. ENNIS:  All right.  Now, the fourth area in

     4           which we challenge Dr. Olsen's expertise is with respect to

     5           PICs technology, or how cumbersome it would be to use PICs

     6           technology.

     7           BY MR. ENNIS:

     8           Q   Dr. Olsen, is it fair to say that your knowledge of PICs

     9           has been gained exclusively after being retained by the

    10           Department of Justice in this litigation?

    11           A   I have read the specifications since being retained by

    12           the Department of Justice.  Most of my opinions on PICs have

    13           to do with computer science technology in general.

    14           Q   Again, you read the downloads from the Web pages?

    15           A   Yes.

    16           Q   Since being retained in this litigation?

    17           A   That is true.

    18           Q   Is it fair to say you have no idea and have no expertise

    19           in how cumbersome PICs would be to use?

    20           A   I have never seen PICs used.

    21           Q   Is the answer to the question then yes?

    22           A   In terms of experimental evidence, I have no idea what it

    23           would take.

    24           Q   Would you please look at page 133 of your deposition

    25           transcript?

                                                                           202

     1           A   Number again, please?

     2           Q   133.  And do you see the question, "Question:  How about

     3           for PICs technology?

     4                    "Answer:  For PICs technology, it is more cumbersome

     5           than that.  How cumbersome, I would be unwilling to

     6           characterize because I think that's beyond my expertise in

     7           PICs other than that I read the materials and it is a more

     8           cumbersome mechanism for rating."

     9                    Do you see that question and answer?

    10           A   Yes.

    11           Q   Now, do you believe today you are qualified to testify as

    12           an expert in how cumbersome it is to use PICs technology?

    13           A   I would not characterize myself as being able to say how

    14           individuals or how human beings would function in trying to

    15           create such specifications.  I am perfectly comfortable with

    16           identifying to you exactly what you would have to do in the

    17           technology, and what has to be specified.

    18                    MR. ENNIS:  A final area in which we challenge Dr.

    19           Olsen's expertise, your Honors, is in the day-to-day

    20           operations of libraries, including how libraries classify

    21           materials and what libraries do.

    22           BY MR. ENNIS:

    23           Q   Dr. Olsen, you've had no experience running a library,

    24           have you?

    25           A   That is correct.

                                                                           203

     1           Q   And is it fair to say that you do not have knowledge of

     2           the day-to-day operations of an existing library?

     3           A   That is correct.

     4           Q   And that you do not have knowledge of what librarians do

     5           and how librarians classify materials?

     6           A   That is correct.

     7                    MR. ENNIS:  That concludes my voir dire, your

     8           Honors.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We will note the plaintiffs'

    10           reservations.  We will hear Dr. Olsen and the points will go

    11           to the weight of his testimony.

    12                    MR. ENNIS:  I appreciate the courtesy, your Honor. 

    13           Thank you.

    14                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

    15           BY MR. ENNIS:

    16           Q   Dr. Olsen, for simplicity and speed, I'm going to talk

    17           first about a category of information which I'll call for

    18           convenience tagging speech.  Your declaration reflects the

    19           opinion that it is simple for a speaker or a content provider

    20           to add a four-character string to the address or the title of

    21           their speech; is that correct?

    22           A   That is correct.

    23           Q   And the purpose of adding that four-character string is

    24           to communicate information about the content or nature of the

    25           speech that is so tagged or labeled; is that correct?

                                                                           204

     1           A   It could be used for that, yes.

     2           Q   The four-character string that you propose in your

     3           declaration as an example is a dash followed by the capital

     4           letter L followed by the numerals 18; is that correct?

     5           A   That is correct.

     6           Q   What information would that string of characters

     7           communicate to listeners or speakers who knew nothing other

     8           than those four characters?

     9           A   That would communicate nothing.  It was not designed for

    10           that purpose, to communicate with people.  It was designed to

    11           communicate with software.

    12           Q   And what would it communicate to software that knew

    13           nothing other than those four characters?

    14           A   If the software had not been configured to catch it, it

    15           would mean absolutely nothing.

    16           Q   Well, suppose it had been configured to catch it, what

    17           would it mean to the software?

    18           A   It would depend on what the software was programmed to

    19           do.  If the software was programmed to ignore it, the program

    20           would ignore it.

    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Dr. Olsen, could you stay back a

    22           little bit?  I'm losing some of your answers because of your

    23           puffing into the microphone.  Thank you.

    24           BY MR. ENNIS:

    25           Q   What do you mean the phrase dash capital L --

                                                                           205

     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  What was that -- I'm sorry, I did

     2           miss the answer to his last question, if the software --

     3                    MR. ENNIS:  I'm sorry, your Honor.

     4                    THE WITNESS:  The question, I believe, was if I put

     5           a -L18 and some software catches it, he said what would that

     6           mean to the software.  My answer was it would mean whatever

     7           that software was programmed to mean.

     8                    If, for example, we were talking about a Web browser

     9           and that Web browser was programmed to look for -L18 and this

    10           is a minor flag was turned on in the browser, then it would

    11           refuse to ask for that information.  It's merely a code.

    12           BY MR. ENNIS:

    13           Q   That's assuming the browser would understand -L18 to mean

    14           not appropriate for people under 18; is that what you're

    15           saying?

    16           A   All I used, I approached this from a technical point of

    17           view that said could I identify material that's not

    18           appropriate for people under 18.  It was my understanding the

    19           Act was concerned with that.  And I suggested one mechanism

    20           by which that could be encoded.

    21           Q   But the four characters, -L18, could as easily mean okay

    22           for people under 18.

    23           A   Absolutely.  It depends on the convention --

    24           Q   It's a convention.

    25           A   Absolutely.

                                                                           206

     1           Q   Does the letter L there mean legal?

     2           A   It means less than.

     3           Q   It means less than.  Why is it capitalized?

     4           A   I just felt like it.  I needed an example.

     5           Q   Does the -L --

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So it wouldn't look like a one.

     7                    THE WITNESS:  That is actually true.

     8           BY MR. ENNIS:

     9           Q   Does the -L18 string mean inappropriate for persons under

    10           18 for any reason whatsoever?

    11           A   When I approached this problem, I approached it in

    12           response to Mr. Bradner's testimony, which was that it was

    13           not possible to tag.  My understanding of the law was that it

    14           was important to identify what was not appropriate for under

    15           18-year-olds.  I fabricated a tag that could possibly

    16           represent that.  That could be programmed to be anything,

    17           that's not important.

    18           Q   So it could mean inappropriate because of violent

    19           content?

    20           A   I made no judgment about why you would want to say not

    21           for less than L18.

    22           Q   Pardon me?

    23           A   I made no judgment as to why you would want to say less

    24           than -- not less than --

    25           Q   So there's nothing in those characters which would

                                                                           207

     1           indicate to a speaker who might use them that it means

     2           inappropriate because of sexually oriented content?

     3           A   It would not.  You would need something like PICs to give

     4           more detail.

     5           Q   All right.  In other words, it would be necessary that

     6           there develop a common understanding of what -L18 means and a

     7           consensus among speakers worldwide and among listeners

     8           worldwide of what -L18 means.

     9           A   You would need a consensus between speakers and the

    10           software that was being used by listeners, yes, you would.

    11           Q   Now how long do you think it would take -- well, first,

    12           is it fair to say you've created this -L18 concept in the

    13           last two weeks?

    14           A   Yes.

    15           Q   How long -- and you haven't submitted it to any Internet

    16           standards community?

    17           A   I have not.  I created it purely as an example of what

    18           was possible.

    19           Q   Do you know of any comparable convention, for example,

    20           Kidcode (ph) has ever been submitted to any Internet

    21           standards community organization?

    22           A   Yes.  Mr. Vezza just testified that PICs had been.

    23           Q   Do you know what Kidcode is?

    24           A   No, I don't, I'm sorry.

    25           Q   Now, how long do you think it would take for the

                                                                           208

     1           consensus you acknowledge would have to spring up to develop

     2           around the use of the four character -L18 string?

     3           A   We're focusing carefully on L18.  Mr. Vezza has just

     4           testified that there are market forces that would make such

     5           things available very quickly.  He testified under PICs. 

     6           PICs is comparable to what I wanted to do.

     7           Q   Well, the reason I'm asking that question is we're

     8           talking about compliance with an Act that's in effect.

     9           A   Mm-hmm.

    10           Q   And your proposal is to use -L18.  How long do you think

    11           would it take to emerge the consensus that worldwide speakers

    12           would know what that means and begin to use it?

    13           A   It would depend on the people who are producing Web

    14           browser software, other client software.  To the extent that

    15           they adopted it, it could move rapidly.  To the extent they

    16           didn't, it may move much more slowly.

    17           Q   In other words, it's uncertain.

    18           A   Absolutely.

    19           Q   Do you agree that technologically and conceptually there

    20           is no difference between using the string -L18 or using the

    21           string XXX, triple X?

    22           A   The only difference would be, and I purposely selected

    23           L18 for this, and that is that currently in most of the

    24           Internet commerce I'm acquainted with, L18 does not appear. 

    25           XXX does have some societal meaning, but other than that

                                                                           209

     1           technologically there is no difference.

     2           Q   Technologically and conceptually.

     3           A   No.

     4           Q   And I take it technologically and conceptually there

     5           would be no difference between using as the string the

     6           letters SEX?

     7           A   There would be a problem with SEX.  The problem that

     8           would occur there is when you select a word that has a common

     9           English meaning, you start to interfere with the normal use

    10           of that word in its normal meaning.  So, for example, if you

    11           were screening on the word SEX, you would screen out things

    12           from some organization that was discussing why one should not

    13           have sex.

    14           Q   I understand that --

    15           A   So -- when you incur -- when you bring in a word that has

    16           a common everyday meaning, then you start to get fuzzy about

    17           what you are and are not screening for.

    18           Q   Unless the common, everyday meaning is pretty clear like

    19           X-rated, triple X?

    20           A   Yes.

    21           Q   Well, let's stick with triple X for now.

    22           A   Yeah, that one works because it's sort of a code in our

    23           society that's been established by makers of various kinds of

    24           movies.

    25           Q   Do you agree that the, as you described it, simple act of

                                                                           210

     1           adding a three or four-character string to an address or

     2           title of your speech which says XXX or which says -L18 would

     3           not by itself insure that minors would not have access to

     4           that speech?

     5           A   Without filtering software on the receiving end, no, it

     6           would not be sufficient.

     7           Q   In fact, isn't it fair to say that in order for the

     8           speaker to have assurance that the speaker's speech is not

     9           displayed in a manner that would be available to a minor,

    10           it's not enough that the speaker tag the speaker's speech 

    11           -L18 or something comparable if all they did was tag and

    12           there was no other cooperative technology, that wouldn't be

    13           enough, correct?

    14           A   That depends on what kind of assurance you want.  If you

    15           want the kind of assurance that's necessary in a monetary

    16           transaction where you're actually exchanging something of

    17           significant value, that would not be enough.  If you want

    18           something less than that, which is to prevent a large number

    19           of minors from accessing a piece of material, and as Mr.

    20           Vezza testified, you would have almost all the browsers

    21           looking for PICs or some other labeling.

    22           Q   I'm not talking about if you have the browsers looking. 

    23           As of now I'm just talking about the simple act of tagging,

    24           self rating my own speech, labeling it XXX or -L18, if that

    25           by itself will not insure that my speech so tagged would not

                                                                           211

     1           be available to minors; correct?

     2           A   And my testimony is it depends to the extent to which

     3           browsers catch it.  If there are no browsers catching it, you

     4           have nothing.  If most of the browsers in the world catch it,

     5           you can have a high degree of assurance.

     6           Q   Well, that's talking about what browsers might do, and we

     7           are going to get to that.  Just take this in logical order. 

     8           The mere act of tagging or labeling or self rating speech by

     9           itself is not sufficient to insure that minors will not have

    10           access to that speech.  Correct?

    11           A   That is true.

    12           Q   So if I self rate my speech triple X, that by itself is

    13           not going to insure that minors do not have access to it.

    14           A   I will agree with you on that with the caveat that

    15           communication does not occur without both a speaker and a

    16           listener.  And to have ignored the listener is to have

    17           ignored something important.

    18           Q   All right.  Now, as you just started to indicate in your

    19           answer, the tagging is not enough, you're going to have to

    20           have some capacity to block the speech once it's been tagged,

    21           to filter or block it; is that correct?

    22           A   That is correct.

    23           Q   And in order to do that, you're going to need to have

    24           software that's capable of recognizing the tag and then if

    25           it's set that way to block speech with that particular tag,

                                                                           212

     1           correct?

     2           A   That is correct.

     3           Q   And that software could be used not to block but to find

     4           an access speech that's so tagged, correct?

     5           A   That is also correct.

     6           Q   All right.  The blocking software could be either at the

     7           speaker's end of the communicative chain or somewhere down

     8           the communication pipeline; is that correct?

     9           A   That is correct.

    10           Q   Now, for convenience and simplicity here, I'm going to

    11           try to break this down.  I'm going to speak first about

    12           speaker blocking and ask you questions about that, and then I

    13           will ask some questions about user or client blocking,

    14           blocking at the user or client end.  Is that convention

    15           understood?

    16           A   Yes.

    17           Q   The main point we have here is we're not trying to block

    18           all speech that's tagged -L18 or triple X or whatever,

    19           correct?  We want that speech to be available to adults --

    20           A   Yes, that is correct.

    21           Q   -- but not available to minors.

    22           A   That is correct.

    23           Q   So it's not just a simple matter of having a software

    24           program that automatically blocks all speech with that label.

    25           A   That would not be appropriate.

                                                                           213

     1           Q   So in addition to the software, we are going to need to

     2           have some means of verifying the ages of the listeners who

     3           are requesting access to that speech; correct?

     4           A   If we are to verify that it doesn't go to a minor, yes,

     5           we will need that.

     6           Q   Yes.  And that will mean that with respect to blocking at

     7           the speaker end, the speaker would have to have some way of

     8           verifying the age of the people attempting to access that

     9           speech; correct?

    10           A   That is correct.

    11           Q   And if we're blocking at the client or user end, there

    12           would have to be some way at that end to verify the age of

    13           the person attempting to access the speech.

    14           A   That is correct.

    15           Q   All right.  Now, first let's talk about user end

    16           blocking.  With respect to user or client blocking, do you

    17           agree that if the speaker is relying on the client's software

    18           to do the blocking, existing client's software and present

    19           technology is insufficient to provide assurance to speakers

    20           that the client software is able to block and is actually

    21           blocking?

    22           A   One more time, please?

    23           Q   Do you agree that insofar as the speaker is relying on

    24           user blocking software, that existing technology and present

    25           technology is insufficient to provide any assurance to the

                                                                           214

     1           speaker that the client's software is actually able to block

     2           and is actually blocking?

     3           A   With current technology the only assurance you might have

     4           would be a statistical one in the sense that if I understood

     5           X percent were blocking, then I would have an assurance that

     6           some X percent was not getting through.

     7           Q   Well, in particular, if you were to speak today, there is

     8           no client browser software that would verify to you, the

     9           speaker, that that client browser software was filtering,

    10           correct?

    11           A   That is correct.

    12           Q   There's no such browser on the shelf purchasable today.

    13           A   Does not exist.

    14           Q   So if you as the speaker tag your speech -L18 or triple X

    15           and then you were relying on blocking at the user end to make

    16           sure minors didn't access the speech you had so tagged,

    17           there's no technology today that could give you assurance

    18           that your speech would not be available to minors.

    19           A   Again I'd qualify that with assurance.  For example, if

    20           you did tag it with XXX, it's already been testified that

    21           Surfwatch, for example, is watching for XXX.  To the extent

    22           that Surfwatch is deployed, you have that amount of assurance

    23           that it's not getting through, but no more than that.

    24           Q   Well, let's be clear here.  You could have some assurance

    25           that anybody who is using Surfwatch should get blocked.  But

                                                                           215

     1           what I'm asking is you could have no assurance as the speaker

     2           that the particular home that's getting that speech and using

     3           Surfwatch or any other -- any browser is actually running

     4           that program and is actually blocking.

     5           A   That is true.  There is no technology that will give you

     6           a handshake that says yes, indeed, I am doing this service

     7           for you.  Your only assurance is statistical.

     8           Q   Let's turn for a moment to blocking at the speaker end. 

     9           At the speaker end, if the speaker is going to do the

    10           blocking, the speaker is going to have to have software or

    11           have a contract with a company that has software that can do

    12           the blocking at the speaker end; correct?

    13           A   That is correct.

    14           Q   Is it fair to say that not all speakers have that

    15           software today?

    16           A   Whether or not they have it, I couldn't say.  Whether or

    17           not they could obtain it readily off the shelf, there is

    18           software that one could obtain that could assist in doing

    19           that.  Whether or no all speakers right now have access to

    20           that on their site, I don't know what they have installed on

    21           their site.

    22           Q   Would most of the software you're talking about involve

    23           use of a CGI script?

    24           A   Yes, that would be one way of doing it.

    25           Q   Do you have any knowledge whether the Web pages that are

                                                                           216

     1           made available by America Online, Compuserve, Prodigy,

     2           Microsoft, to speakers who contract with them for those Web

     3           pages have the capacity to provide CGI script technology?

     4           A   It is my understanding that they do not currently allow

     5           that for reasons of security.

     6           Q   Now, we've talked a little about the software, but we

     7           began by indicating the software is not enough either.  You

     8           have to have a separate age verification system in order to

     9           screen minors from adults.  Now, again for simplicity, let's

    10           try and break it down and I'll ask you first what could

    11           speakers directly do themselves if they were going to be

    12           doing the blocking and they were going to be doing the age

    13           verification to determine who's adults and who's minors. 

    14           First about what speakers could do directly themselves, and

    15           then I'll ask you what speakers could do through third party

    16           age verification systems.  Okay?

    17           A   We're assuming the speaker has control over the Web

    18           server?  The software is actually providing the service on

    19           the Web?

    20           Q   Yes.

    21           A   Okay.

    22           Q   And now the speaker has to determine age.

    23           A   Exactly.

    24           Q   Are there two basic ways of determining age?  One is

    25           through some sort of an ID, adult ID, or adult access code,

                                                                           217

     1           and the other is through credit card verification, is that

     2           fair?

     3           A   Those are the ones that I'm aware of.

     4           Q   Let's talk first about the use by the speaker of an adult

     5           ID or access code system.  If a speaker wanted to make his or

     6           her speech available to the entire adult world, is it fair to

     7           say that there is no existing ID or access code listing of

     8           which people in the world are adults and which are not?

     9           A   There is no on line listing that I know of that would

    10           identify all of the adults in the world.

    11           Q   Is there any off line listing you're aware of?

    12           A   Not that I'm aware of.

    13           Q   Now, putting aside for the moment adult --

    14           A   Excuse me.

    15           Q   Sure.

    16           A   I'm sorry.  The only possibility I could think of is

    17           possibly the Social Security Administration.

    18           Q   Okay.  That's not -- that information is not available to

    19           common speakers, correct?

    20           A   Yeah, but it is there, and I'm sure they know how old we

    21           are.  (Laughter.)

    22           Q   But what we're talking about here is speakers who are

    23           trying to comply with the Communications Decency Act and to

    24           verify age.  There's no such listing available to those

    25           speakers.

                                                                           218

     1           A   No.

     2           Q   Now, putting aside for the moment the use of credit cards

     3           as a proxy for adulthood, we're really now trying to find out

     4           actual adulthood, is there any system of which you're aware,

     5           any adult ID registration system, any adult access code

     6           system that a speaker could use to determine whether the

     7           listeners attempting to access that speaker's speech are

     8           adults or not?

     9           A   Existing today I know of no adult code mechanism.  That

    10           does not mean one could be readily built, and one of the

    11           things we've seen about the Internet is technology develops

    12           very quickly when there is a need.  But I do not know of one

    13           that exists at this moment.

    14           Q   And if one sprang up, would it take some sort of an

    15           authority to have control over that?

    16           A   It would depend to what extent you wanted to insure

    17           adulthood.  There are various ways that it could spring up

    18           whereby libraries or other public institutions could verify

    19           adulthood and then all share them in a central database. 

    20           That is possible.  Whether they would not, I could not say.

    21           Q   Would you look, please, at page 224 and 225 and 226 of

    22           your deposition?

    23           A   Okay.

    24           Q   Do you recall being asked the following question.  "How

    25           do you envision those would work?

                                                                           219

     1                    "Answer:  I guess part of the question is, it would

     2           depend on who issued them.  Some authority is going to have

     3           to issue them.  I don't know who that might be."  

     4                    Do you see that?

     5           A   Yes.

     6           Q   And then further down you say "Not necessarily a

     7           Governmental authority," do you see that?

     8           A   What line, excuse me?

     9           Q   Line 20.

    10           A   20, okay.

    11           Q   And then line 11 on page 225, "Yeah, I don't know of one. 

    12           If that becomes a necessary part of adult access on the

    13           Internet, I would immediately postulate the market would

    14           create such authorities quite quickly."  That's what you just

    15           testified to, correct?

    16           A   Exactly.

    17           Q   And then you go on to page 226 to say, line 7 -- line 8. 

    18           "As far as some other way of obtaining the code, I know of no

    19           such service."  Correct?

    20           A   That is correct, other than the possibility of Verisign

    21           (ph) and I could not testify as to the details of what

    22           they're proposing.

    23           Q   Okay.  Now, do you agree that there is nothing in current

    24           technology that would enable a speaker to go to a news group,

    25           a chat room, a list serve, and get back an adult access code

                                                                           220

     1           for everyone who was listening?

     2           A   I do not know of any such technology.

     3           Q   So again there's no way a speaker today could get

     4           assurance through technology that only adults were in the

     5           news group, chat room or list serve to which that adult

     6           wished to speak?

     7           A   If you want a positive verification, I know of no way. 

     8           It would only have to be statistical as I mentioned before.

     9           Q   All right.  Now, in addition to the adult ID system,

    10           which there's none in place today, another possible way for

    11           the speaker to verify age is through the proxy of a credit

    12           card, correct?

    13           A   Yes.  I would be reluctant to say there is no other

    14           possible way.  That is the only other one I know of.

    15           Q   Now, you've already testified that you don't personally

    16           know what it would cost you as a speaker to verify credit

    17           cards, and you haven't checked that cost with credit card

    18           companies.

    19           A   I have not.

    20           Q   And suppose you wanted to make your speech available for

    21           free.  Do you know whether credit card companies would verify

    22           those noncommercial transactions at all?

    23           A   I have no knowledge.  I would suspect they would not.

    24           Q   Let's turn to speaker verification of age through third

    25           party systems.  This time the speaker is not doing it

                                                                           221

     1           directly.  Your declaration suggests that there are springing

     2           up some third party systems that might do age verification --



     3           A   Such as Adult Check or Validate.

     4           Q   Adult Check or Validate.  And again, what you know about

     5           those is what you learned from their Web pages recently?

     6           A   Yes.  I read their technical specs.

     7           Q   I assume there's no -- you're not aware of any adult ID

     8           list or adult access code that's available to those third

     9           party verification systems that's not directly available to

    10           you as the speaker; correct?

    11           A   From my reading of it what they're doing is they're

    12           building their own databases.

    13           Q   Based largely on the use of credit cards?

    14           A   Yes.

    15           Q   And again, since you didn't profess to know about this,

    16           you don't know what those third party verification systems

    17           would do with credit card information in order to verify it.

    18           A   No.  I have no idea what they actually do with --

    19           Q   All right.  Well, let's move on then.  I'd like to shift

    20           ground now and talk about another subject for a while, PICs,

    21           PICs technology.  You would agree, would you not, that PICs,

    22           a browser with PICs technology, could be set to reject all

    23           unflagged speech?

    24           A   Yes.

                                                                           222

     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  All what?

     2                    MR. ENNIS:  All untagged or unflagged speech.  All

     3           speech that did not carry a label that was a PICs compatible

     4           label.

     5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yes, I understand.  I didn't

     6           hear, I'm sorry.

     7           BY MR. ENNIS:

     8           Q   Correct?

     9           A   That is correct.

    10           Q   Or you would agree, would you not, that if a parent

    11           wanted to, a parent could set a PICs browser to prevent that

    12           parent's children from accessing any speech at all unless A,

    13           the speech was PICs flagged, and B, the speech was PICs rated

    14           as appropriate for minors by a third party rating service the

    15           parent trusts.  Correct?

    16           A   With a minor caveat which I hope isn't a quibble, and

    17           that is that there are no PICs browsers right now.

    18           Q   Well, I understand.

    19           A   But assuming there was, setting that aside, yes, a parent

    20           could do that.  A parent could set such a browser and one can

    21           easily be built to exclude everything except what was rated

    22           appropriately.

    23           Q   By a third party rater that the parent trusted.

    24           A   That is correct.  It --

    25           Q   The parent doesn't have to trust --

                                                                           223

     1           A   May I finish?

     2           Q   Sure, I'm sorry.

     3           A   The net result of that would be to create a kid's ghetto

     4           which is, you would lock them out of most of the Internet,

     5           but you could do that.

     6           Q   Well, it might be a kid's ghetto or it might not,

     7           depending on how many third parties had rated how many sites

     8           as appropriate for children, correct?

     9           A   That is correct.  Part of my declaration is is that that

    10           would be a problem.

    11           Q   All right.  But a parent for example could say, I'm going

    12           to set my PICs browser so that when I'm home, I'll have

    13           access to the whole Internet, myself.  But when I'm not home,

    14           I'm going to set it so my child will not have access to

    15           anything on the Internet unless it's A, PICs flagged, and B,

    16           rated in a PICs-compatible way as appropriate for my child by

    17           the Boy Scouts of America, the Christian Coalition, any third

    18           party rating service the parent trusts.

    19           A   That is correct.

    20           Q   And the parent doesn't have to trust the rating attached

    21           to the speech by the speaker.  The parent may have no idea

    22           whether Joe Jones, the speaker who says this material is

    23           appropriate for kids, is rating accurately or not, right?

    24           A   It is true that by going through a third party they don't

    25           have to trust the speaker, they can trust the third party if

                                                                           224

     1           they desire.

     2           Q   All right.  Now, if a parent has set their PICs browser

     3           in that way, to block all access by their children to

     4           material from the Internet unless it's appropriately rated by

     5           a third party the parent trusts, in that circumstance then

     6           isn't it fair to say that the children would be protected

     7           from any inappropriate material regardless of whether

     8           speakers flagged their speech or not, and regardless of how

     9           they tagged their speech.  Correct?

    10           A   It is true they would be protected from inappropriate

    11           material.  They would also be protected from most of the Web.

    12           Q   From any part of the Web that hadn't been rated, approved

    13           by a third party rating system.

    14           A   Which is most of the Web.

    15           Q   But the point here, the critical point I believe we agree

    16           upon, is that if a parent is concerned enough to deprive

    17           their child of access to the whole Web, to set their PICs

    18           browser in that way, then at that point there is no need for

    19           Government or anyone else t compel the speaker to label their

    20           speech at all.

    21           A   If parents want to deprive their children of most of the

    22           Web, they could do that.  That is true.

    23           Q   Of course a parent doesn't have to set PICs technology

    24           that way.  A parent could set PICs technology to allow

    25           everything to come to their child unless that material had

                                                                           225

     1           been rated as inappropriate for children by a third party

     2           rating service the parent trusts, correct?

     3           A   That is true.  They could also do that if the speakers

     4           had accepted the responsibility and they could trust unrated

     5           speech, then they'd have all the Web.

     6           Q   Well now, your proposal, unlike PICs, relies exclusively

     7           on trusting the speaker to label properly, responsibly, is

     8           that fair?

     9           A   So does the PICs self-tagging scheme.

    10           Q   Yes, but --

    11           A   I would not want to characterize that as my proposal or

    12           PICs.  There are -- a primary feature of the PICs system is

    13           self rating, and I am entirely in favor of that and

    14           supportive of that.

    15           Q   All right.  The PICs also strong features and encourages

    16           third party rating, correct?

    17           A   Right.

    18           Q   And your proposal doesn't rely on third party rating

    19           systems at all.

    20           A   No.  My declaration specifically points out problems with

    21           third party systems.

    22           Q   Well, let me talk about some of the problems about

    23           relying exclusively on the speaker to rate.  How is a parent

    24           to know whether potentially 40 million speakers who have

    25           rated their speech around the world have acted responsibly?

                                                                           226

     1           A   The same way I know whether or not my bank's

     2           advertisement is true, because there are laws that say they

     3           cannot lie.

     4           Q   Ah.  Well, speaking of laws, does your proposal make any

     5           assumptions about whether foreign speakers would responsibly

     6           label their speech -L18 or whatever convention is adopted?

     7           A   In doing my analysis of the problem I did not consider

     8           foreign speech because I was not aware that Congress could

     9           legislate foreign speech.

    10           Q   So with respect to any speech that for any reason is not

    11           labeled appropriately in the -L18 code or whatever other

    12           convention comes up, under your proposal that speech would

    13           reach the home?

    14           A   That is true.

    15           Q   All speech that's foreign posted where people don't care

    16           about United States laws, that would reach the United States

    17           also --

    18           A   Unless some other measure was taken, that is true.

    19           Q   We seem to have shifted ground here.  We're now talking a

    20           little more about your particular -L18 proposal, so let's

    21           stay there as long as that's where we're at.

    22           A   Okay.

    23           Q   Again, a difference between your proposal and PICs is

    24           that PICs can be imbedded in the client browser or in the

    25           actual computer operating system, correct?

                                                                           227

     1           A   You're talking about client side blocking?

     2           Q   Yes.

     3           A   It wouldn't really matter whether you imbedded in the --

     4           in terms of -L18 or in terms of PICs, they are the same in

     5           that regard.  You can imbed them in the operating system, you

     6           can embed them in the browser.  There are technical

     7           preferences as to why you go one or the other, but it doesn't

     8           really matter.

     9           Q   Your proposal envisions that the software for recognizing

    10           the -L18 tag and blocking it would be imbedded in the

    11           browser, correct?

    12           A   That is one place.  You could also imbed it exactly the

    13           place Surfwatch embeds its keyword checking.

    14           Q   But your primary proposal, your recommendation is that it

    15           be in the browser?

    16           A   My position, my technical position is I don't care.  It's

    17           irrelevant.

    18           Q   Well, doesn't your declaration say that if it's imbedded

    19           in the operating system, that can complicate the operating

    20           system, and that is not a good idea?

    21           A   It might.  It might.  But that's a technical decision. 

    22           It could work.  It would not be a problem.

    23           Q   Oh, I thought your declaration said that it would be a

    24           problem.

    25           A   If I had to make an implementation choice, that's

                                                                           228

     1           probably where I wouldn't put it.  But it would work.

     2           Q   You'd put it in the browser.

     3           A   It would work in the operating system.  It doesn't

     4           matter.

     5           Q   All right.  Insofar as your proposal is imbedded in the

     6           browser, isn't it fair to say that even if a parent went to

     7           the trouble to buy a browser some point down the line in the

     8           future that has the software to read your -L18 code and has

     9           that installed, turns it on, that a minor in that home could

    10           easily go out onto the Internet and for free download a quite

    11           different browser that's not configured to recognize and

    12           block -L18, correct?

    13           A   They could do that.  They could download one that did not

    14           recognize PICs.  They could download one that didn't do any

    15           of that.  Yes, enterprising children could do that.

    16           Q   And if a child were to use that way of getting around

    17           your proposal, then --

    18           A   And the PICs proposal.

    19           Q   Well, not if the PICs proposal is embedded in the

    20           operating system.

    21           A   Well, then embed mine in the operating system, too.  It

    22           doesn't --

    23           Q   Well, all I'm trying to get at is you quibble with PICs

    24           about whether it should be in the operating system.

    25           A   Well, let me state that for the purposes of this law,

                                                                           229

     1           quibbling about in the operating system or in the browser is

     2           irrelevant.  Both technologies can go both places.  It

     3           doesn't matter.  And another set of enterprising teenagers

     4           could un-install it from the operating system.

     5           Q   Have you ever tried to do that?

     6           A   To un-install stuff?

     7           Q   No, to un-install Surfwatch or Cyber Patrol or --

     8           A   No.

     9           Q   -- Net Nanny from an operating system?

    10           A   No, I haven't.  However, you could reinstall the

    11           operating system and it would effectively take it away.  And

    12           I know a large number of teenagers that can do that.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That can't or can?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  Can.

    15                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Can.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Have you seen them?  I mean have

    17           you observed that?  Is that from your own --

    18                    THE WITNESS:  I would not characterize them as a

    19           majority.  In fact, I would characterize them as a relatively

    20           small majority, but almost every high school has four or five

    21           kids who really love their computers, and yeah, they could do

    22           that.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Have you seen -- speaking of your

    24           own knowledge, have you seen them do that?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  To see them specifically install an

                                                                           230

     1           operating system?

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Or take one out, yeah.

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  It's a common problem we have

     4           actually in our labs at BYU.  When they don't like the

     5           operating system we put in there, they take it out and put

     6           their own in.  It causes no end of grief.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But are they kids or are they over

     8           18?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  These are freshmen just out of high

    10           school, some of them --

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But they're over 18?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  It depends.

    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Maybe.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  I guess I would characterize to you --

    15           I would characterize to you that their knowledge is not

    16           significantly higher when they enter our program than they

    17           had in high school in that regard.  For some kinds of

    18           machines it actually is relatively easy.

    19           BY MR. ENNIS:

    20           Q   Dr. Olsen, you testified that you haven't done this

    21           yourself.  Are you aware that some of the end user software

    22           that is on the market today is specifically designed so that

    23           if a child attempts to do exactly what you just said they

    24           could do, that the whole system shuts down?

    25           A   If they attempt to disable it?

                                                                           231

     1           Q   Yes.

     2           A   To the extent that they directly try to disable it, yeah,

     3           I believe that's probably the way it works, but that's not

     4           the only way to get at the problem.  You can reinstall the

     5           operating system.

     6           Q   You agree, do you not, that a significant number of the

     7           host servers that are connected to the Internet are located

     8           outside of the United States, possibly 40 percent?

     9           A   I couldn't characterize the percentage, but it's a

    10           nontrivial number.  It's a very significant percentage, yes.

    11           Q   And growing?

    12           A   And growing.

    13           Q   Let me turn to a group of miscellaneous questions for a

    14           moment.  They don't fall neatly under any category.  Would

    15           you agree that because of the ways that news groups propagate

    16           through other news groups, that even a speaker who posted to

    17           a tagged news group, to a news group that was tagged in its

    18           heading -L18 or XXX, would have no assurance that his or her

    19           speech would not be available to minors?

    20           A   Same problem we discussed before.

    21           Q   So your answer is yes.

    22           A   Your only assurance is to the extent that filtering

    23           browsers have been deployed.

    24           Q   And in order to be safe, a speaker who wanted to post a

    25           message to such a news group would have to either establish

                                                                           232

     1           their own news server, buy, own and operate their own news

     2           server, or independently verify that everyone -- and

     3           independently verify that everyone accessing it is an adult,

     4           that's one way, correct?

     5           A   Characterize safe for me, please?

     6           Q   In order to be safe, a person who wanted to post to a

     7           news group --

     8           A   No, the issue is, are we talking about safe in that safe

     9           from prosecution under the CDA?

    10           Q   They wanted to comply with the Communications Decency

    11           Act, and they wanted to post a message which they think it's

    12           appropriate to post, certainly to adults, but might be

    13           considered indecent for minors.

    14                    MR. BARON:  Objection.  Calls for a legal

    15           conclusion.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Let's go back to the -- by this

    17           point I've lost the question.

    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, I would permit it though,

    19           wouldn't you?

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, is --

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is the question intelligible to you?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  The issue I'm talking about is the

    23           issue of safe.

    24                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Right, yes.

    25                    THE WITNESS:  And if you wanted, without drawing a

                                                                           233

     1           legal conclusion --

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No, a layperson's, a layperson's --

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Let's let him answer when it's

     4           rephrased so we can all understand it.

     5                    THE WITNESS:  No, it's -- if I can clarify it, it

     6           will be fine.  

     7                    MR. ENNIS:  Let me rephrase the question without the

     8           word safe in it.

     9                    THE WITNESS:  I think I can clarify it, if it's

    10           fine.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, why don't you let him ask his

    12           question and then you can answer --

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Well, the issue is --

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, no, let him ask his question,

    15           okay?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Oh, I'm sorry.

    17           BY MR. ENNIS:

    18           Q   Suppose I'm a speaker and I want to post a message to a

    19           news group, and I want to be sure that my particular message

    20           is not going to be available to anyone under 18 who has

    21           access to that news group.  I can't do that.  I can't be sure

    22           that people in existing news groups are under 18, correct?

    23           A   If the assurance is zero minors will receive this, no.

    24           Q   Now, one thing I could do is I could buy, own and operate

    25           my own news group, correct?

                                                                           234

     1           A   That is one way.

     2           Q   But then I would have to independently verify the age of

     3           everyone who had access to it.

     4           A   And that would give you absolute assurance, yes.

     5           Q   Right.  Another way I could do it is by posting a

     6           reference in the news group to my speech, but posting the

     7           speech somewhere else, for example, on a Web site that I own

     8           and control where I also independently verify age.

     9           A   That is true.

    10           Q   Short of that though there is no way I can just speak to

    11           a news group and have assurance that my speech will not be

    12           available to minors.

    13           A   Again, the issue of assurance.  If you're talking about

    14           absolute perfection, no.  If you're talking about some

    15           reasonable statistical view that 90 percent of the minors

    16           cannot receive my speech, then there are other possibilities. 

    17           But if you're talking about a contractual monetary assurance,

    18           no.

    19           Q   Well, let me ask it this way.  Is it fair to say that as

    20           of today with respect to all or the vast majority of news

    21           groups in the country, a speaker posting a patently offensive

    22           message to a news group has no way of insuring that that

    23           message will not be available to persons under 18?

    24           A   Under the assumption that browsers are not filtering,

    25           that is true.

                                                                           235

     1           Q   Are you aware of the Internet Yellow Pages and other

     2           directories?

     3           A   I'm aware of a number of such things, yes.

     4           Q   Are you aware of any of those directories that at the

     5           present time list speech according to what's appropriate for

     6           people under 18 and speech which is only appropriate for

     7           people over 18?

     8           A   I have not seen such a category, no.

     9           Q   Now, speaking not as a legal matter, I'm not asking for a

    10           legal conclusion under the Communications Decency Act, but if

    11           you were a speaker and you thought about posting a centerfold

    12           from Playboy Magazine, would you personally think that that

    13           image might be indecent or patently offensive for persons

    14           under 18?

    15           A   You're asking me for a conclusion about the decency of a

    16           particular piece of --

    17           Q   No, I'm asking for your personal opinion, would you

    18           personally think that that image might be indecent or

    19           patently offensive for persons under 18?

    20           A   So you're asking me for a conclusion as to patently

    21           offensive?

    22           Q   You personally.

    23                    MR. BARON:  Objection.  It's beyond the scope.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What?  Excuse me?

    25                    MR. BARON:  It's beyond the scope of his direct

                                                                           236

     1           examination.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  A lot of the witnesses have

     3           been so asked, you know, from both sides, but go ahead.  It

     4           is beyond the --

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But so what?

     6                    MR. BARON:  We're presenting Dr. Olsen as a

     7           technical expert.

     8                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  We understand, but --

     9                    MR. BARON:  Not as a speech witness.

    10                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  We'll let him answer that

    11           question.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We're going to let him answer it.

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  If we consider the local

    14           community which consists of Dan, Dan would be offended.

    15           BY MR. ENNIS:

    16           Q   And how about the seven dirty words?

    17           A   Dan would be offended.

    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Who's Dan?

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Who's Dan?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  That's me, I'm sorry.  That's me. 

    21           (Laughter.)

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, he's the community.  He is an

    23           expert on what would offend him.

    24                    THE WITNESS:  That's a relatively small community,

    25           but it's the one I know best.  (Laughter.)

                                                                           237

     1                    MR. ENNIS:  May I take one moment, please?

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.  

     3                    (Pause in proceedings.)

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I should have waited for you to ask

     5           him.

     6                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I thought it was an acronym. 

     7           (Laughter.)

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I can't imagine why you would think

     9           that.

    10                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honors, we have attempted to divide

    11           cross-examination between us, and I know Mr. Hansen has some

    12           questions in areas that I have lightly touched upon but

    13           didn't explore in depth, so I think I have no further

    14           questions at this time.

    15                    MR. HANSEN:  Good afternoon, your Honors.  My name

    16           is Christopher Hansen, one of the lawyers representing the

    17           ACLU plaintiffs.  Mr. Ennis is modest.  He asked most the

    18           questions I wanted to ask, so I have relatively few to ask

    19           the witness.  I'd like --

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The witness won't cry about that.

    21                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

    22           BY MR. HANSEN:

    23           Q   Dr. Olsen, I'd like to bring this from the abstract down

    24           to the concrete.  I'd like you to assume a hypothetical

    25           situation for me, if you would.  I'd like you to assume first

                                                                           238

     1           that I am a nonprofit organization, noncommercial

     2           organization, that I run a Web site, that I would like to get

     3           the information on my Web site to the maximum number of

     4           people I possibly can, and I currently offer the information

     5           for free to everybody, and that this Act has gone into effect

     6           as of 6:00 p.m. this evening and I don't want to go to jail. 

     7           I don't want to even risk going to jail.  

     8                    I'd like to now talk about what it is I might have

     9           to do in order to make sure that the Government doesn't start

    10           investigating me at 6:15 this evening.  Now, first what I

    11           have to do is I have to tag my speech under your proposal,

    12           correct?

    13                    MR. BARON:  Objection.  I just want to clarify that

    14           this is a hypothetical, that as the Court is well aware the

    15           CDA is not being enforced pending the decision of this Court

    16           and --

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That hasn't eluded our attention. 

    18           (Laughter.)

    19                    MR. BARON:  Thank you, your Honor.

    20           BY MR. HANSEN:

    21           Q   The first thing I would have to do is tag my speech under

    22           your proposal, correct?

    23           A   Correct.

    24           Q   Now, I want you to assume that the name of my Web site is

    25           the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and I want you to assume

                                                                           239

     1           I have 14,000 separate files in my Web site, some of which

     2           might be at risk under this statute and some of which might

     3           not.  The first thing I'm going to have to do is go to each

     4           of the 14,000 files and decide whether to tag each one

     5           indecent or not indecent, correct?

     6           A   Whether or not you would actually have to look at all of

     7           them is actually problematic.  I assume that you've

     8           categorized them in some way and you could recognize quickly

     9           that there are large categories you don't need to look at. 

    10           But I will grant you that there is some labor involved in

    11           doing the tagging.  I would not characterize that that label

    12           means you looked at every one of those 14,000 pages.

    13           Q   14,000 files.  A file can be a lot more than one page,

    14           correct?

    15           A   Yes.  For clarity, when I refer to a page it means a

    16           file, and I will use them interchangeably.  I'm sorry.

    17           Q   Now, I want you to assume that some of my files are in

    18           fact multiple pages and within that file some of the material

    19           is clearly decent by anybody's standard, and some is

    20           potentially indecent under somebody's standard.  Then I have

    21           to not only go to my 14,000 files, but I have to go below my

    22           14,000 files and decide what parts of those files to tag and

    23           what parts not to tag, correct?

    24           A   Not necessarily.  It depends on how much of a compelling

    25           interest you have in making sure that all of those actually

                                                                           240

     1           go to children.  You could, if you wanted, and assuming

     2           tagging browsers were deployed, you could immediately tag

     3           your entire site as being inappropriate for minors and then

     4           over time work you way down exposing pieces as you felt it

     5           was important to get them out to minors.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Excuse me.  Suppose it's a large

     7           museum and they have -- I mean I don't know if that's within

     8           the scope of what you're asking, Mr. Hansen.

     9                    MR. HANSEN:  It is, your Honor.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Suppose it was a large museum, a

    11           really big one with a lot of different pieces in the museum

    12           from different cultures all over.  Does that make it --

    13           that's the only way I can sort of try to think about this.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  Right.  The issue here --

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And I didn't mean to stop you in

    16           your --

    17                    THE WITNESS:  No.  Please forgive me for trying to

    18           characterize what the counsel is driving at.  There is an

    19           issue of what it would take to get started, in other words,

    20           this transition period when the Act goes into effect.  And

    21           then there is the issue of what would I have to do on an

    22           ongoing basis over time.  So if I have a large electronic

    23           museum, of which at this point there are relatively few,

    24           electronic museums.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right, but it could be another

                                                                           241

     1           kind of museum.  It could be a museum of paintings which one

     2           might --

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Your Honor, the reason I characterize

     4           a difference is because if you had a large museum of

     5           paintings which was not in electronic form and you wanted to

     6           put them on the Web, there is a process by which you would

     7           have to go through to put them on the Web.  So as you put

     8           them on, I presume you would tag them.  And you already are

     9           going through a process of paging through each one of them,

    10           so you only incurred a small additional cost of evaluating

    11           them.  That's different than I already have a huge electronic

    12           library and I have to go back and sort it all out.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Which you would agree is a big task,

    14           or potentially a big task?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  If you didn't have a

    16           characterization that would help you narrow that down, it

    17           could be a big task.  Many libraries have characterizations

    18           that can help them, but I couldn't, as Mr. Ennis has pointed

    19           out --

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You mention that in your

    21           declaration, the Library of Congress system.

    22                    THE WITNESS:  There are ways to use classifications

    23           to get closer.  Whether they would work in all cases I

    24           couldn't say.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, I'm sorry, I interrupted you,

                                                                           242

     1           but I was trying to make it concrete for me, not necessarily

     2           for him.

     3           BY MR. HANSEN:

     4           Q   And if I'm trying to avoid going to jail by 6:15, you

     5           suggest one of my options is I tag my whole site -L18, thus

     6           preventing minors from getting access even to those portions

     7           of my site that I know are perfectly acceptable to minors. 

     8           That's one of the short-term solutions I have; is that right?

     9           A   If you were going to do it by 6:15 tonight, I cannot

    10           conceive of another solution.  There's not time to do

    11           anything.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Except label the whole thing -L18.

    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  That's what he said, yeah.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  Exactly, exactly, yes.

    15           BY MR. HANSEN:

    16           Q   Well, you proposed one other alternative in your

    17           deposition which is I could shut my entire site down for a

    18           month or two and reconfigure the whole thing, correct?

    19           A   Yes.  However, as we've talked about, just labeling the

    20           entire site would be a little less Draconian and is easily

    21           possible.

    22           Q   But would prevent all minors from accessing all of my

    23           material, even that which is unquestionably decent?

    24           A   That is true.

    25           Q   Now, there are some kinds of files that you can't tag

                                                                           243

     1           because tagging would destroy the file itself; correct?

     2           A   No, that is not correct.

     3           Q   So you disagree with Mr. Bradner's position on that?

     4           A   Mr. Bradner -- I do not disagree directly with Mr.

     5           Bradner's position.  Having read through what Mr. Bradner

     6           said, Mr. Bradner said you could not change the contents of

     7           those files because it would destroy the format.  In that

     8           regard Mr. Bradner is correct.

     9                    However, the proposal which I put in which was in

    10           direct response to Mr. Bradner's declaration was that you

    11           could change the name and that would not damage the file.  I

    12           specifically, in designing the -L18 counterproposal, if you

    13           will, I specifically looked at that because there are things

    14           that you can't change the contents, but by changing the name

    15           you have tagged.

    16           Q   Well, I'd like you to look at your deposition, if you

    17           would, at page 256.  I'm sorry, it's 255.  My Xerox is

    18           unclear.

    19           A   Which line?

    20           Q   12.  The question you were asked was, "I understood Mr.

    21           Bradner to suggest there were some files you couldn't embed a

    22           tag in, that you would simply destroy the integrity of the

    23           file, is that accurate?"

    24                    And your answer was "Yes."

    25                    "Question:  And what kinds of files are those?

                                                                           244

     1                    "Answer:  A GIF, G-I-F, image."

     2                    Was that your testimony?

     3           A   Yes, except the proposal that is stated in the

     4           declaration does not change the file.  It changes the name.

     5           Q   And if the -- okay, I understand.

     6           A   So I did not directly contradict Mr. Bradner in that

     7           regard.  He is absolutely accurate.  You can't go in the file

     8           and mess with some of them.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And a GIF again is what?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  It stands for graphical interchange

    11           format.  The example would be the same if it was JPEG (ph)

    12           which is another graphics format, MPEG (ph) which is a movie

    13           format.  Mr. Bradner testified about some data files that he

    14           had.  It would probably not be appropriate to damage the

    15           data.  That's why I specifically went for the -L18 proposal,

    16           because you could change the name without actually having to

    17           modify the data and damage the integrity of what he's doing.

    18           BY MR. HANSEN:

    19           Q   But the only way that would work is if you tagged the

    20           entire file with the same tag.  And so if it were one of

    21           those files we were talking about before, part of which was

    22           unquestionably decent and part of which was questionable,

    23           you'd still have to tag the whole thing indecent for your

    24           proposal to work, correct?

    25           A   No.  If we take for example --

                                                                           245

     1           Q   Correct?

     2           A   Well, let me -- I'll get there.

     3           Q   All right.

     4           A   If you take the GIF image, for example, that is true. 

     5           You would have a hard time unless you did something to break

     6           the image apart to put the tags in because there is no

     7           mechanism for embedding.  If it was HTML, you could embed a

     8           tag inside as Mr. Vezza has already testified.

     9           Q   Now, I want you to assume hypothetically that the name of

    10           my Web site is CDT, Center for Democracy and Technology, and

    11           that I add on to my Web site the equivalent of hundreds of

    12           typed pages of material a week.  Every time I did that from

    13           now until eternity under your proposal I would have to read

    14           all of those -- and assume I'm not the author of all of those

    15           pages.  Under your proposal every time I did that I would

    16           have to read it and decide whether to tag it or no and decide

    17           whether to tag subparts of it or not; is that correct?

    18           A   If there's going to be a label associated with it,

    19           somebody will have to read it.  It will either be you or a

    20           label bureau or a parent, but somebody will have to make the

    21           judgment.

    22           Q   But under your proposal it's me that has to make the

    23           judgment, right?

    24           A   That is correct.  Assuming you are the speaker.

    25           Q   And you said at your deposition that if I want to make

                                                                           246

     1           the right kind of judgment under the law, I might well have

     2           to hire and consult a lawyer in making these judgments,

     3           correct?

     4           A   Or you could be conservative about it and just classify

     5           it for adults.

     6           Q   Now, even -- I want you to next assume that my Web site

     7           is called Critical Path AIDS Project, and on my Web site I

     8           have hundreds of links to other sites.  Under your proposal,

     9           how does that work?

    10           A   Okay.  If you were using -L18, the links to the other

    11           sites, there were actually several things we talked about in

    12           the deposition.  One was that the other site is friendly with

    13           you, and they are going to tag their stuff in some regular

    14           way in which case a small program could be written that would

    15           go through and fix your links in the same regular way.

    16           Q   So I'd have to get on the phone or get on E-mail with all

    17           of these hundreds of other sites and we'd all have to talk

    18           and figure out a joint way of working this all out.

    19           A   I recommend a news group.  It's the way things are done

    20           on the Internet.

    21           Q   Is there an alternate way in which I could do the -- and

    22           if one of the other sites didn't tag themselves -L18, would I

    23           then have to block access to that site, get rid of --

    24           A   Block access to the site?

    25           Q   Get rid of my link to that site?

                                                                           247

     1           A   I wouldn't think so, unless your link itself was

     2           explicitly sexual or some other reference.  It doesn't seem

     3           to me that holding the name of something which might be

     4           explicitly offensive is not the same as having something

     5           explicitly offensive.

     6           Q   Well, in order to have a link from my site to somebody

     7           else's, I have to take certain actions, correct?

     8           A   You have to have the URL, yes.

     9           Q   And I have to type that URL into my site and I have to

    10           make a conscious decision to make that link.

    11           A   That is true.

    12           Q   So if I'm responsible for making it easy for minors to

    13           use the link that I have created to get access to that

    14           material, I'd better know what's on that link site as well as

    15           what's on my own site, hadn't I?

    16           A   Not necessarily.

    17           Q   Why not?

    18           A   All you've done is say there is something over there. 

    19           You haven't said anything -- you haven't revealed or exposed

    20           or in any way communicated any explicit material.  I don't

    21           see how -- what you're saying is you're saying that I would

    22           incur liability by -- I would incur responsibility for

    23           Playboy's content by having mentioned Playboy to someone. 

    24           That doesn't seem to be reasonable.

    25           Q   Have I made Playboy more available if on my Web site I

                                                                           248

     1           have created an explicit link to Playboy?

     2           A   You've made Playboy more available if you told anybody

     3           about Playboy.  It is the same thing.

     4           Q   Now, if all of the hundreds of sites that I have links to

     5           also adopt the -L18 convention, I'm going to have to change

     6           all the URLs on all my links to reflect that they've changed

     7           all their addresses, correct?

     8           A   And if there is some cooperative mechanism, that can be

     9           done automatically.  Also I should point out that -L18 is not

    10           necessarily the only way that you could have done the

    11           labeling.  You could have done it with PICs and then you have

    12           not changed the names and you have not broken the links.

    13           Q   Right.  But we're the ones proposing PICs.  You're the

    14           one that's proposing -L18.

    15           A   No, no, no.  I'm the one that's proposing labeling on the

    16           part of the content provider.  I only proposed -L18 as an

    17           example of how it could be done because Mr. Bradner said it

    18           couldn't be.

    19           Q   Well, and you said that PICs and your proposal were

    20           comparable.  But PICs does not require me as the speaker to

    21           self label, does it?

    22           A   But it allows it.

    23           Q   That's right, but your proposal requires me as the

    24           speaker to self label, correct?

    25           A   That is true.

                                                                           249

     1           Q   Now, even if I've done all this tagging, either of my

     2           files or my subfiles or my links, the next -- that still

     3           hasn't prevented me from being vulnerable under this law,

     4           correct?

     5           A   Your only assurance at that point, as we discussed with

     6           Mr. Ennis, is to the extent to which browsers are available

     7           and are catching it.  As Mr. Vezza just testified, very soon

     8           we will have browsers that will catch the PICs labels, and

     9           you have some assurance.

    10           Q   Well, I'm talking about 6:15 this afternoon.

    11           A   6:15 this afternoon --

    12           Q   If I put your -L18 in all the places I need to on my site

    13           and done nothing else, I'm still pretty vulnerable, aren't I?

    14           A   In the world of software, compliance with anything by

    15           6:15 this afternoon, you are vulnerable.  I don't care what

    16           it is you're trying to accomplish.

    17           Q   All right.  Now, I want you to assume that my Web site

    18           receives 50,000 unique visitors every day.  How do I screen

    19           each of those 50,000 people to determine whether they're

    20           above 18 or below 18?

    21           A   Same techniques we discussed with Mr. Ennis.

    22           Q   There are two of them as I understand you to say with Mr.

    23           Ennis.  One is I could do credit card verification.

    24           A   That's true.

    25           Q   And my hypothetical is I'm a nonprofit, noncommercial

                                                                           250

     1           site and I'm not selling anything.  You don't know whether

     2           this proposal will work for me, right?

     3           A   Well, it depends on how you define "will it work for me."

     4           Q   You don't know whether the credit card companies will

     5           verify credit cards for me if I ask them to without attaching

     6           a commercial transaction to it, correct?

     7           A   I do not know -- I guess the easiest way to say this is I

     8           do not know nor do I particularly believe that for free they

     9           would do the validation you want.

    10           Q   So if I want to comply relatively quickly with this

    11           statute, I'm probably going to have to -- one of my options

    12           is I'm going to have to talk to the credit card companies and

    13           see if they'll let me pay them for each of my 50,000 visitors

    14           to verify the credit cards.  And we don't even know whether

    15           they'll say yes or not, but at least that's one possible

    16           approach I have, correct?

    17           A   That is.

    18           Q   And I don't know whether today that approach is going to

    19           work or not, right?

    20           A   Well, wait a minute.  I mean all -- we would have to

    21           process some transaction.  

    22           Q   Okay.

    23           A   Whether or not -- I would be enormously surprised if

    24           MasterCard says no, we will not let you charge something on

    25           our service.

                                                                           251

     1           Q   Now, the alternate approach that you propose is this

     2           adult ID system, correct?

     3           A   Mm-hmm.

     4           Q   And you propose in your declaration three or four

     5           companies that exist now that will do this, correct?

     6           A   Yes.

     7           Q   One example is Adult Check, correct?

     8           A   That is correct.

     9           Q   And I believe as you told Mr. Ennis, what you know about

    10           Adult Check is that you looked at their Web site.

    11           A   I looked at their Web site and I also studied their

    12           specification of how they claim that their stuff works.

    13           Q   Did you make any effort to determine whether the people

    14           behind Adult Check are reputable or not?

    15           A   No.

    16           Q   So you don't know if I go to Adult Check and put my

    17           credit card number in there, you don't know whether they sell

    18           it to other people or not?

    19           A   I have no idea what they do.

    20           Q   You don't know if they sell it to people who -- let me

    21           ask this.  Did you look at what sites currently use Adult

    22           Check?

    23           A   No.

    24           Q   Would it be fair to say that the sites that currently use

    25           services like Adult Check are essentially pornography sites

                                                                           252

     1           of the kind in the Coppolino book?  (Laughter.)

     2                    MR. BARON:  Objection.  Calls for speculation.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is it -- I'm sorry.  Is the

     4           objection to the characterization of the book?  (Laughter.)

     5                    MR. BARON:  No.  To this witness' knowledge.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You're objecting that it's beyond

     7           the scope of the witness' knowledge?  I'm sorry, I just don't

     8           understand the objection.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I didn't hear it.

    10                    MR. BARON:  The objection is -- well, the question

    11           was whether he knows something in detail about pornography on

    12           these sites.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, no.  But you've put this

    14           witness forward --

    15                    MR. BARON:  That's correct.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- and they've objected to his

    17           knowledge about this general field, part of the field, and

    18           we've let him on, and they're trying to show in part that his

    19           experience is limited at best on some of this because this is

    20           something the witness has proposed as a possibility.  It

    21           seems to me that he ought to be able to continue to question

    22           him on a very significant point.

    23                    MR. BARON:  I think there's a difference between a

    24           mechanism, your Honor, and substance, but that's fine.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  We'll continue.

                                                                           253

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That makes it all clear, doesn't it?

     2           BY MR. HANSEN:

     3           Q   Do you still remember the question?

     4           A   The answer, Mr. Hansen, is that when I believe either

     5           Adult Check or Validate had a long list advertising who it

     6           was that had already signed up with them and which providers

     7           were going through them, I did not look at that list at all,

     8           I didn't care.  I was only interested in how does this

     9           technology work.  So I really could not characterize what

    10           kind of sites they were, who they were, I have no idea.  I

    11           only looked at the technology.

    12           Q   I want you to assume hypothetically that if we booted the

    13           computer back up right now and got the Adult Check Web site

    14           on the screen and looked at the list that every single Web

    15           site currently listed under Adult Check would be what you and

    16           I would fairly characterize as triple X or true pornography

    17           sites.

    18           A   That would not surprise me, but I have no knowledge.

    19           Q   Okay.  So under your proposal if I'm this hypothetical

    20           Electronic Frontier Foundation or Critical Path AIDS Project,

    21           I have to send all of the 50,000 people who come to my site a

    22           day to those people and ask them to list themselves on that

    23           site, on Adult Check site, which we just established largely

    24           as a place where people list themselves who want to get

    25           access to pornography --

                                                                           254

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We haven't established, we've

     2           assumed.

     3                    THE WITNESS:  No, we didn't -- we did not establish.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  We'll assume.

     5                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

     6                    MR. HANSEN:  You're correct, you're correct.  

     7           BY MR. HANSEN:

     8           Q   I have to send all of my potential readers off to this

     9           list that hypothetically includes only sites that are

    10           pornography sites, correct?

    11           A   I guess your question is would I have to send these

    12           people off to them, and the answer is -- before I answer the

    13           question, I would like to complain slightly about the 6:15

    14           characterization.  The reason I complain about that is

    15           because what it does is it precludes a number of other

    16           actions you might take.  If we postulated a one-month

    17           characterization, for example, then it is possible that the

    18           ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation and any number of

    19           others could say we really don't want to be associated with

    20           Adult Check, and you could have established an equivalent

    21           service of your own that would not have all these people on

    22           it and then you would not have to have guilt by association. 

    23           When you characterize 6:15, obviously you could not take any

    24           of those measures because they will take time to accomplish,

    25           but they are possible.

                                                                           255

     1           Q   Well, Dr. Olsen, my colleagues have helped me out while

     2           you were doing that answer, and they have showed me Exhibit 6

     3           to Mr. Schmidt's declaration, which I'd like to show you.

     4                    (Off the record.)

     5           BY MR. HANSEN:

     6           Q   Would you agree with me that most of those sites appear

     7           to be pornography sites?

     8           A   I don't know what's there, but I wouldn't go there.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, chick of the day could be

    10           poultry.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, you really are in for ducks and

    12           poultry.  (Laughter.)

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's a leitmotif.

    14           BY MR. HANSEN:

    15           Q   Nor would you want to be associated with that list, would

    16           you?

    17           A   No, I wouldn't.

    18           Q   In addition to that, if I were to send all of my

    19           potential listeners to Adult Check, my listeners would have

    20           to pay money to Adult Check in order to get an adult ID from

    21           Adult Check, correct?

    22           A   That is my understanding.

    23           Q   And if I have to comply with this law quickly, that's my

    24           only option at this point, isn't it?

    25           A   If you were assuming compliance within 6:15, yes.  If

                                                                           256

     1           you're assuming compliance within a month or two, you could

     2           with your community of friends create an equivalent site

     3           where you would not have to have bad neighbors.

     4           Q   And it might well cost me a significant amount of money

     5           to set up an equivalent site, mightn't it?

     6           A   I couldn't judge how much money it would cost you to do

     7           that.

     8           Q   Now, the one area that Mr. Ennis did not cover is E-mail. 

     9           I want you to assume with me that again I'm head of the

    10           Critical Path AIDS Project, and I get dozens of E-mail

    11           requests for information about safer sex practices a day,

    12           which at the moment I respond to without knowing the identity

    13           of the person who is seeking the information.  Can I continue

    14           to do that under your system?

    15           A   Well, you would have to clarify something for me under

    16           the CDA, since I'm -- my understanding of the CDA says did

    17           you knowingly communicate with a minor.  If there's nothing

    18           in the E-mail that you replied to to indicate they were a

    19           minor, I don't think you've knowingly communicated with a

    20           minor.  Aside from that minor quibble which would be a legal

    21           decision, there is the issue of do you know if it's a minor,

    22           and the answer is no, you don't.

    23           Q   So to be 100 percent sure, I'd have to stop answering the

    24           questions from people who came to me by E-mail, correct?

    25           A   Unless the interpretation of the law that's been

                                                                           257

     1           characterized to me is that by not knowing you could reply in

     2           a one-on-one situation.

     3                    MR. HANSEN:  Okay.  I have no more questions, your

     4           Honors.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Are there any other plaintiffs'

     6           cross-examination?

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I think Mr. Baron --

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, I know, but they may have some

     9           more.  Okay.  Any redirect?

    10                    MR. BARON:  Your Honor, may I suggest that if we

    11           take just a very short break so that I may confer with my

    12           colleagues concerning redirect --

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Sure.  We might have some questions

    14           though.

    15                    MR. BARON:  And this witness has indicated a problem

    16           with his -- a time.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I know.

    18                    MR. BARON:  Can I get some sense from the Court,

    19           because I might go through a time period where Dr. Olsen may

    20           need to leave and beyond?

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I'm sorry.  Do you think that your

    22           -- when does he have to leave, quarter after 5:00?

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Quarter after 5:00.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And you think that -- and I don't

    25           want to cut you off, this is your case, and you're entitled

                                                                           258

     1           to ask it.  And if it means your witness has to come back,

     2           your witness has to come back, because, you know, the

     3           Government doesn't have that many witnesses and I think we

     4           ought to hear you.  How long do you think you'll be today --

     5                    MR. BARON:  Well, I could start, your Honor.

     6                    THE COURT:  You don't believe you'll finish?

     7                    MR. BARON:  I don't believe I'd finish by 5:15.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's what I wanted to know, by

     9           quarter after 5:00.

    10                    MR. BARON:  That's correct.

    11                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honors, may I respectfully request

    12           that we press on as much as possible, because the witness may

    13           say something on redirect Monday morning if we don't finish

    14           to which we need to have a rebuttal witness we don't know

    15           about as of now.  So the more we can get done now, the more

    16           likely it is --

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right.  Well, of course we're

    18           not cutting him.  He wants five minutes or a few minutes to

    19           talk to --

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sure.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Sure, and his answer is yes.  Do

    22           you want us to leave or do you want us to ask questions or

    23           (laughter) -- what will you like?  We'll do whatever you

    24           like.

    25                    MR. BARON:  Just call another recess for another

                                                                           259

     1           five or ten minutes.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Five minute recess.  All right.

     3                    (Recess taken at this time.)

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Please be seated.

     5                    Mr. Baron, how would you like to proceed?  Because

     6           if you would prefer, because it is 5:00 o'clock and I'm sure

     7           everyone's rather tired, and Mr. Ennis, it seems to me that

     8           the redirect has to be within the scope of cross, so

     9           therefore Mr. Baron's not going to open up a subject that

    10           hasn't already been opened, because you've finished your

    11           cross-examination.  I simply don't see any need to subject

    12           the witness to the rigors of Friday afternoon traffic to the

    13           airport when he's going all the way back to Utah, but what is

    14           the Government's preference here?

    15                    MR. BARON:  Well, Dr. Olsen will be available though

    16           5:15 or so today, but he will also be available on Monday,

    17           and we would be willing to start --

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, what would you like to do,

    19           would you like to start asking questions?

    20                    MR. BARON:  Starting early on Monday would be fine

    21           with us.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, well, let's do that.  I

    23           think that's practical.  And I don't think the plaintiffs are

    24           prejudiced at all because your redirect is limited to the

    25           subject of cross.

                                                                           260

     1                    MR. BARON:  Thank you, your Honor.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We haven't been that strict --

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  True, true.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We haven't been that strict, but we

     5           find it unlikely that you're going to know a lot different

     6           later if he goes on and questions for another 15 minutes.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And, Counsel, I want to see you in

     8           15 minutes anyway to conference back there as we've been

     9           doing anyway.  All right?

    10                    Thank you all very much.  Have a good weekend and a

    11           good flight.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  Yes.  And we'll see you

    13           Monday morning.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  I'll be here.

    15                    (Proceedings concluded.)

     1                    (Whereupon the following occurred in open court at

     2           9:25 o'clock a.m.:)

     3                    CLERK OF COURT KUNZ:  Oyez, oyez, oyez, all manner

     4           of persons having any manner to present before the Honorable

     5           Delores Case Sloviter, Chief Judge of the United States Court

     6           of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and the Honorable Ronald L.

     7           Buckwalter and the Honorable Stewart Dalzell, Judges in the

     8           United States District Court in and for the Eastern District

     9           of Pennsylvania, may at present appear and they shall be

    10           heard.

    11                    God save the United States and this Honorable Court. 

    12           Court is now in session, please be seated.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Good morning.

    14                    ALL COUNSEL:  Good morning.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, if April is the cruelest

    16           month, it's certainly starting out that way.  No spring.  

    17                    We'll hear a continuation, this is a continuation of

    18           the plaintiffs' case in the motion for preliminary injunction

    19           in ACLU and American Library Association versus Reno and

    20           Department of Justice.  And the plaintiffs are, we have

    21           received and absorbed, I hope, the direct case of plaintiffs'

    22           case and I assume that you have brought witnesses here for

    23           the purpose of cross-examination by the Government.  And we

    24           will hear your witnesses.

    25                    I understand the order is Mr. Barrington first.


                                                                             4

     1                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honor, the first witness -- again,

     2           my name is Bruce Ennis for the ALA plaintiffs -- our first

     3           witness is William Burrington.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Burrington.

     5                    MR. ENNIS:  Who is the assistant general counsel of

     6           America Online. 

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.

     8                    MR. ENNIS:  And if Mr. Burrington could take the

     9           stand, before he begins to testify I would move into evidence

    10           the declaration of William Burrington sworn to on March 27th,

    11           1996, as his trial testimony.

    12                    THE COURT:  Thank you.  Is the Government agreeable?

    13                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, we object to Mr.

    14           Burrington's testimony only insofar as he's being offered as

    15           a technical expert.

    16                    Paragraph 3 of his declaration indicates that he's

    17           qualified to testify as an expert on the commercial on-line

    18           services industry and on parental control empowerment tools. 

    19           We understand that to encompass general policy matters as

    20           well as the general nature of those parental controls.  We do

    21           not believe he is qualified to testify as an expert on the

    22           technical nature of how America Online's network operates or

    23           on the specific technical aspects of the parental empowerment

    24           tools that we'll be discussing today.

    25                    We would develop this further on cross-examination


                                                                             5

     1           for the Court, but we would object to his testimony to the

     2           extent it is offered or construed to encompass technical

     3           matter.

     4                    THE COURT:  We will accept his testimony and if

     5           there's any specific matter that you want to call to our

     6           attention as outside his purview of expertise, then we'll

     7           take it up specifically, but at the moment we'll take it 

     8           for -- as it's presented.

     9                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honors, if I may, because the

    10           Government has indicated they may want Mr. Burrington to

    11           refer to some of the supplemental exhibits, I think it would

    12           be efficient if I could move at this time Plaintiffs'

    13           supplemental Exhibits 290 through 299 be received in

    14           evidence.  I understand there is no objection from the

    15           Government.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, let's let the Government say

    17           whether they object or not.  Mr. Coppolino.

    18                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No objection, your Honor.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  Thank you.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  They'll be admitted then.

    21                    (Plaintiffs' Exhibits 290 through 299 received in

    22           evidence.)

    23                    WILLIAM W. BURRINGTON, ESQ., Plaintiffs' Witness,

    24           Sworn.

    25                    THE COURT CLERK:  Thank you, please be seated. 


                                                                             6

     1           Please state and spell your name.

     2                    THE WITNESS:  My name is William W. Burrington, last

     3           name is spelled B-u-r-r-i-n-g-t-o-n.

     4                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

     5           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

     6           Q   Good morning, Mr. Burrington.

     7           A   Good morning.

     8           Q   Mr. Burrington, you have on the witness stand a copy of

     9           your deposition transcript, is that correct?  It's in one of

    10           those notebooks there.

    11           A   Yes.

    12           Q   And a copy of Volume 3 of the defendants' exhibits?

    13           A   Yes.

    14           Q   And a copy of your declaration?

    15           A   Yes.

    16           Q   And a copy of the exhibits Mr. Ennis just referred to?

    17           A   That's correct.

    18           Q   Okay.  

    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I would indicate to the Court as

    20           well we have provided you with Volume 3 of Defendants'

    21           Exhibits, some of which we may be referring to throughout the

    22           day for these witnesses.

    23           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    24           Q   Mr. Burrington, what is your current position?

    25           A   I'm the assistant general counsel and director of public


                                                                             7

     1           policy for America Online in Vienna, Virginia.

     2           Q   How many attorneys are in the office of general counsel

     3           of America Online?

     4           A   Approximately 20.

     5           Q   And how long have you been with America Online?

     6           A   Since February 1st, 1995.

     7           Q   Paragraph 2 of your declaration indicates that you

     8           received a law degree from Marquette University in 1987, is

     9           that correct?

    10           A   That's correct.

    11           Q   And Paragraph 2 also indicates that you practiced media

    12           and telecommunications law in Milwaukee and in Washington,

    13           DC, is that correct?

    14           A   That's correct.

    15           Q   Paragraph 2 also indicates, I believe, that you direct

    16           America Online's international, federal, state and local

    17           public policy activities, is that correct?

    18           A   That's correct.

    19           Q   And that you focus on issues concerning consumer

    20           protection, intellectual property and the First Amendment, is

    21           that correct?

    22           A   Partially correct; there's additional issues as well.

    23           Q   Does your expertise concern substantive legal and policy

    24           issues that may affect on-line services?

    25           A   Yes, it does.


                                                                             8

     1           Q   Do you consider yourself to be a technical expert on the

     2           specific technical aspects of commercial on-line services?

     3           A   Not -- not as a computer wonk (ph.), if you will, but as

     4           a layperson, technical understanding, yes.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What was it that you said that you

     6           weren't an expert on?  I didn't hear that.

     7                    THE WITNESS:  I used the term computer wonk, your

     8           Honor, meaning I'm not a computer programmer or have that

     9           kind of background, but I understand the general technology

    10           of America Online and the Internet.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.

    12           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    13           Q   Mr. Burrington, you have not had any formal training in

    14           computer software development, is that correct?

    15           A   That is correct.

    16           Q   Or in computer networking systems, is that correct?

    17           A   That's correct.

    18           Q   Or in computer communications protocols, is that correct?

    19           A   That is also correct.

    20           Q   And is it correct to say that in your work at America

    21           Online you often work with those who are technical experts

    22           who understand how America Online operates as a network?

    23           A   Yes, I do.

    24           Q   And do the technical people you work with also have

    25           technical expertise in the various parental control


                                                                             9

     1           technologies that we'll be talking about today?

     2           A   Yes, they do.

     3           Q   And in the course of your work at America Online do you

     4           rely on the expertise of the technical staff at AOL?

     5           A   Yes, I do.

     6           Q   Okay.  In Paragraph 3 of your declaration you use the

     7           term "commercial on-line service."  Is it accurate to

     8           describe America Online as a commercial on-line service

     9           provider?

    10           A   Yes, that's partially accurate; we're also an Internet

    11           access provider as well.

    12           Q   Would you describe for the Court what a commercial on-

    13           line service provider is?

    14           A   Yeah, if I -- if I may, probably the easiest way to do it

    15           is by analogy.  We, as a commercial on-line service, if you

    16           will picture a resort with a large swimming pool and our pool

    17           has gotten much bigger very fast, it's a private, closed pool

    18           at a resort and there are some lane guidance (ph.) and some

    19           lifeguards and we check the water temperature, then there's a

    20           little channel that leads directly into the ocean, and that

    21           would be the Internet.

    22                    And so we provide both access to our private, closed

    23           network or pool of content, if you will, and we also provide

    24           a quick channel access into the Internet or the vast sea of

    25           information which is the Internet.


                                                                            10

     1           Q   America Online is a service to which individuals or

     2           entities subscribe, is that correct?

     3           A   Yes, it's correct.

     4           Q   And could you indicate for the record what the current

     5           cost of subscribing is for an individual?

     6           A   Generally it's 9.95, $9.95 per month for your first five

     7           hours and then $2.95 per hour thereafter.

     8           Q   And is it also correct that America Online has created

     9           software that is installed on a computer which when activated

    10           enables an individual to access America Online?

    11           A   That's correct.

    12           Q   America Online software frequently comes already

    13           installed on many computers when they're first purchased, is

    14           that correct?

    15           A   Yes, it is correct.

    16           Q   And is it also correct that America Online gives away its

    17           software for free?

    18           A   Yes, it does.

    19           Q   On Paragraph 4 of your declaration you indicate that

    20           America Online has five million members, is that correct?

    21           A   Yes, it is.

    22           Q   Okay.  Some of the other major on-line service providers

    23           are, for example, Compuserve, Prodigy and Microsoft Network,

    24           is that correct?

    25           A   Yes.


                                                                            11

     1           Q   On Paragraph 23 of your declaration I believe you

     2           estimate that Compuserve has four million members, Prodigy

     3           two million and Microsoft about one million, is that correct?

     4           A   Yes, that's correct.

     5           Q   So in all is it fair to say that there are approximately

     6           12 million subscribers to commercial on-line services?

     7           A   Give or take a few thousand.

     8           Q   That is not the total number of individuals who are

     9           connected on-line to the Internet, is that correct?

    10           A   Yes, that is correct.

    11           Q   There are, as you indicated I believe earlier, other so-

    12           called Internet service providers that provide access to the

    13           Internet, is that correct?

    14           A   Yes, it is correct.

    15           Q   How does an Internet service provider differ from an on-

    16           line service provider such as America Online?

    17           A   In a general sense, an interact -- an internet service

    18           provider on ISP provides just the straight conduit, if you

    19           will, it's a straight connection, you dial into a local

    20           telephone number and you're immediately connected to the

    21           Internet.  And sometimes or most often the Internet service

    22           provider will provide the customer with some software to help

    23           them browse the or surf the Net, as it is, but I'm sure here

    24           in Philadelphia you can look in the Yellow Pages and there

    25           are a number of ISP's listed.


                                                                            12

     1           Q   Would you agree that insofar as America Online is

     2           providing access to the Internet specifically that that is

     3           performing a service similar to that provided by an Internet

     4           service provider?

     5           A   Yes.

     6           Q   Okay, would you take a look at Exhibit 292 of the

     7           Plaintiffs' Exhibits which Mr. Ennis, I believe, provided

     8           you.

     9                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I believe the Court should have that

    10           exhibit as well.  292 of the plaintiffs' exhibits.

    11                    (Pause.)

    12           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    13           Q   Do you have that exhibit, Mr. Burrington?

    14           A   Yes, I do.

    15                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Shall I proceed?  Is the Court --

    16           thank you.

    17           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    18           Q   I'm looking at the first page of Exhibit 292 which says

    19           Main Menu -- says America Online at the top and then it says

    20           Main Menu.  Does this exhibit depict the Main Menu when an

    21           individual logs on to America Online?

    22           A   Yes, once they've actually successfully logged on that is

    23           the first screen that they would see.

    24           Q   And this screen sets forth another of different types of

    25           information and services that America Online provides, is


                                                                            13

     1           that correct?

     2           A   Yes, it is.

     3           Q   For example, America Online provides subscribers with

     4           information on a variety of topics such as today's news and

     5           sports education, is that correct?

     6           A   That is correct.

     7           Q   If you'd just flip through the rest of Exhibit 292, these

     8           pages -- do they -- do these pages depict what the screen

     9           looks like for some of the specific content areas on America

    10           Online?

    11           A   Yes, for those areas just by illustrative example, this

    12           is a handful of areas that you can access, yes.

    13           Q   Some of the content that is on America Online is created

    14           by America Online employees themselves, is that correct?

    15           A   Yes, that is correct.  We have our own content areas,

    16           particularly in the areas of news, for example, we have a

    17           News Department that is creating its own original content,

    18           sometimes.

    19           Q   And is it also the case that America Online will contract

    20           with a third party to provide content within the closed area

    21           network, I believe, as you described it for America Online?

    22           A   Yes, a large amount of our content is provided by, as you

    23           say, third-party content providers who create the content and

    24           we help them put it on, put it onto America Online.

    25           Q   Okay, it's a very sensitive mike, sir.


                                                                            14

     1           A   Yes, I have noticed that.

     2           Q   Just for example the Newsstand Icon on this Exhibit 292

     3           first page, does that include a number of on-line, on-line

     4           versions of independent third-party publications?

     5           A   Yes, it will include literally dozens of popular

     6           magazines and newspapers like the New York Times, for

     7           example.

     8           Q   Could you just describe for the Court a couple of

     9           examples of some of those publications for which the on-line

    10           version is provided under Newsstand?

    11           A   It will include in electronic format the New York Times

    12           so you can actually read the New York Times in the morning on

    13           line.  Atlantic Monthly is another example, there are a

    14           number of special interest type publications like Boating

    15           Magazine and things of that nature, but overall it's just a

    16           variety of different newspapers around the country, major

    17           newspapers as well as popular major nationwide magazines.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Does it cost extra to access what

    19           would ordinarily require money like to buy the New York

    20           Times?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  No, your Honor, in fact that's the --

    22           one of the benefits of the on-line services like AOL or

    23           Prodigy is that we offer this vast array of content for a

    24           monthly price and if you go beyond the five hours then you

    25           pay per hour, but you basically have access to included in


                                                                            15

     1           that subscription price all of the content that we have on

     2           America Online.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And would an Internet service

     4           provider that you mentioned before, an ISP, also provide

     5           these newspapers?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  There, your Honor, that's a little bit

     7           different in the sense that a pure Internet access provider

     8           which merely allows you to dial into the Internet, they're

     9           not involved in the content business at all like we are in

    10           terms of packaging and developing content with third parties

    11           like the New York Times, so you could still access through

    12           that Internet service provider the New York Times which also

    13           has an Internet version, a Webpage version of their newspaper

    14           as do a number of other publications.

    15                    So to make it more clear, on America Online we may

    16           have the Atlantic Monthly Magazine and that's a private

    17           contract we have with Atlantic Monthly to supply that content

    18           to our members.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You pay them or they pay you?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  They may pay us, we pay them the

    21           model, the business model is rapidly changing, earlier on we

    22           paid them to attract them to come on to our service.  Now

    23           that we have five million members or ten million sets of

    24           eyes, we of course now are in a better position for them to

    25           pay us to have access to that number of people.


                                                                            16

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And that increases their

     2           subscription and therefore the advertising, is that the

     3           point?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  I think as -- that that is correct,

     5           your Honor.  I think as this business model continues to

     6           evolve and it's literally evolving as we sit here, I think

     7           what you're going to see is there is a tremendous value for

     8           publication like Atlantic Monthly to have access to

     9           potentially five million additional subscribers and the

    10           potential there for advertising revenue, and I think that

    11           that's the model you're going to see increasingly.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I don't want to get into the

    13           Government's questioning, but is the same true if you're

    14           dealing with Penthouse or magazines comparable, on the

    15           assumption there are some?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry, your Honor, what -- 

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I mean, in other words, do they pay

    18           you for you to carry them or do you pay them?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Well, they could but we don't carry

    20           Penthouse.  We made judgments for business reasons and based

    21           on what our members want, we do not have a contractual

    22           relationship with Penthouse.

    23                    But to use your example now, there could be

    24           Penthouse somewhere out there on the Internet, they might

    25           have a Webpage that would contain some of their content, but


                                                                            17

     1           again that would be accessible through to the Internet, not

     2           as a part of our closed community.  We choose not to have

     3           Penthouse in our community.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I mentioned Penthouse because there

     5           was testimony about Penthouse in the first two days.  Okay,

     6           thank you.

     7           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

     8           Q   But following up on Judge Sloviter's question, on the

     9           Atlantic Monthly you have the full text and you have the ads

    10           as well?

    11           A   Well, the answer to that is partially true, I think that

    12           the most of these publications today are offering essentially

    13           electronic versions.  In other words, if you went down to the

    14           news stand here in Philadelphia and picked up the Atlantic 

    15           Monthly, you have the whole magazine.  

    16                    If you go on to click on to the Atlantic Monthly on

    17           America Online, you'll have an electronic version which won't

    18           contain necessarily all the content for that particular issue

    19           or all of the advertisements, for example.  And that's really

    20           what a lot of these publications are doing is offering a sort

    21           of a mini version electronically. 

    22                    A good example is the New York Times, you can read

    23           the lead stories, you can read the key stories in this

    24           morning's New York Times, but you're not going to get every

    25           single item in that paper like obituaries or all of the


                                                                            18

     1           classifieds, for example.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And the Times supplies that version

     3           to you?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct. 

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

     6           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

     7           Q   Just following up on some of the questions, you indicated

     8           that you do not have Penthouse Magazine among the

     9           publications that are provided by America Online under the

    10           Newsstand Icon, is that correct?

    11           A   That is correct.

    12           Q   Nor do you have Playboy Magazine?

    13           A   That's correct.

    14           Q   Do you have any magazines comparable to them?

    15           A   No, we do not.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I don't know any, so I couldn't

    17           ask, but you might.

    18                    (Laughter.)

    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I only know one more, just for the

    20           record.

    21                    (Laughter.)

    22           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    23           Q   It's called Hustler, do you have Hustler?

    24           A   No, we have Boating Magazine is the --

    25           Q   Boating, okay.


                                                                            19

     1                    (Laughter.)

     2           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

     3           Q   Let's just, leaving aside for the moment information

     4           that's on the Internet, does America Online itself create or

     5           make available to subscribers any content of the nature of

     6           Penthouse or Playboy?

     7           A   No, we do not.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  By that I assume you mean, having

     9           not ever seen any of them, but I assume you mean magazines

    10           that are devoted to -- I don't know if it's only women or

    11           male and their bodies, is that a fair description of what

    12           they are?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  I'd say or of this genre of

    14           publications that we're talking about.

    15           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  Perhaps "adult sexually oriented" might be

    16           an additional qualifier --

    17           A   Right.

    18           Q   -- since you might have a magazine with models, for

    19           instance, but adult sexually oriented type magazines or

    20           content.

    21           A   Well, we -- no, we do not have a -- we do not provide 

    22           through again in our closed network we don't have contracts

    23           with third-party content providers of that nature, no, we

    24           don't.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But you are a gateway, are you not,


                                                                            20

     1           for some -- through some vehicle whereby a subscriber might

     2           access such publications?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor.  When I using the

     4           analogy earlier about the resort swimming pool leading to the

     5           ocean, there is that channel, if you will, that two-way

     6           channel that you can get into that channel and you're whisked

     7           into the sea, which is the Internet.  And out on that

     8           Internet there may be and in fact are Websites and perhaps

     9           news groups, publications of the type that you are

    10           referencing.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  When you say whisked into the sea,

    12           you don't mean you're involuntarily whisked, do you?  You

    13           mean that you have access that you could then do something to

    14           give-- "you" being the subscriber -- you have access that you

    15           could in some way make a connection to?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct, your Honor.  From

    17           America Online there is an Icon that you can affirmatively

    18           have to go to and to click on, you know, you double click

    19           with your mouse and that will then connect you into the

    20           Internet and you will actually see a little AOL logo that's

    21           circling on your computer screen to tell you that it's trying

    22           to dial into the pure Internet.

    23           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    24           Q   Just on that point, it doesn't seem terribly legible on

    25           Exhibit -- Plaintiffs' Exhibit 292, but just below Reference


                                                                            21

     1           Desk, that is the supposedly is the Internet connection Icon,

     2           is that correct?  This is the first page of Exhibit 292? 

     3           That's where it is, right?

     4           A   I'm not sure that I --

     5           Q   Exhibit 292 --

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's hard -- it's hard to read.  Can

     7           you read that for us?  It's the one, two, three, four, fifth

     8           one down on the right.

     9           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    10           Q   Below Reference Desk and above Sports?

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Between reference and sports.

    12                    THE WITNESS:  Reference sports.

    13                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Can I assist the witness?

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What does that say?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  Oh, the very first page, I'm sorry,

    16           I'm actually looking at the Reference Desk.

    17                    Boy, that's a -- that's a good question.

    18           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    19           Q   Well, do you know if that's the Internet connection Icon?

    20           A   I think that's, yes, it would be, based on my -- my

    21           experience with our interface, that would be the Internet

    22           connection, yes.

    23           Q   And that's the Icon on which an individual can click and

    24           get to a separate menu describing the Internet services that

    25           are accessible to America Online, is that correct?


                                                                            22

     1           A   That's one way.  The other way you can do it is if you

     2           look at the top of this exhibit, the first page, Exhibit 292,

     3           you'll see a little -- oh, about midway in you'll see new, an

     4           Icon New.

     5           Q    Mm-hmm.

     6           A   Just to the left of that is also an Icon that you could

     7           click on to connect with the Internet.

     8           Q   Through the Internet connection here can an individual

     9           gain access to the so-called Worldwide Web?

    10           A   Yes, they can.

    11           Q   Just so the record is clear, after about a week off,

    12           could you describe to the Court what a Website is like and

    13           what it is?

    14           A   Yes, we could use by way of example, I guess since

    15           they're not playing, the Philadelphia Phillies, but there's

    16           a-- there is a Philadelphia Phillies Webpage which

    17           essentially if you were an AOL subscriber, you could click on

    18           the Internet connection to Icon and then it would take you to

    19           a screen that we have where you can then also click on the

    20           Worldwide Web which would access you into the Worldwide Web. 

    21           And if you know the address for that particular Website, in

    22           this case the Philadelphia Phillies, you would type in that

    23           address much like you would dial a telephone number to get

    24           some place.  And that will then connect to that Website.  And

    25           that Website may contain any kind of information that they


                                                                            23

     1           choose to package on their Webpage, so it's almost like

     2           looking up, I kind of use it as an analogy to an electronic

     3           brochure which basically would maybe have some -- some

     4           graphics, some pictures, in this case some team statistics,

     5           what have you.

     6           Q   Is it also correct that through the Internet connection

     7           individual AOL subscribers could also gain access to so-

     8           called FTP sites?

     9           A   That is correct.

    10           Q   And also to so-called Gofer sites or to Gofer service?

    11           A   That is correct.

    12           Q   AOL subscribers could also gain access to so-called news

    13           groups, is that correct?

    14           A   Yes, that's correct.

    15           Q   We're talking about Internet news groups which are

    16           sometimes referred to USNet groups, is that correct?

    17           A   That's correct.

    18           Q   Also on the main menu, if you look over at the Icon

    19           called Post Office, that is -- is that the Icon which --

    20           through which AOL provides its subscribers an electronic mail

    21           service?

    22           A   That's correct, that would be access to our electronic

    23           mail system.

    24           Q   And this E-mail service allows America Online subscribers

    25           to send electronic mail to other AOL subscribers, is that


                                                                            24

     1           correct?

     2           A   Yes, it is.

     3           Q   And it also allows them to send electronic mail to anyone

     4           on the Internet with an E-mail address, is that correct?

     5           A   That's correct.

     6           Q   Also, finally under this people connection which is the

     7           last one on the left-hand column, is this where the so-called

     8           chat rooms can be accessed, is that correct?

     9           A   Right, that is the access Icon to get into the different

    10           kinds of chat rooms that we have on America Online.

    11           Q   Going to refer you to Paragraph 11 of your affidavit, do

    12           you have Paragraph 11 before you, Mr. Burrington?

    13           A   Yes, I do.

    14           Q   I'm going to begin to ask you some questions about some

    15           of the services we've just discussed.

    16                    Paragraph 11, I believe it's fair to characterize,

    17           expresses America Online's concerns as to liability under the

    18           Communications Decency Act as to certain types of information

    19           and specifically breast cancer, sexually -- this is on Page

    20           6, breast cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, breast

    21           feeding, birthing techniques and further down spectacular

    22           masterpieces from galleries.

    23                    Does America Online itself create or provide by

    24           contract content on these topics?

    25           A   Yes, it does.


                                                                            25

     1           Q   And with respect to breast cancer, sexually transmitted

     2           diseases, breast feeding and birthing techniques, are these

     3           topics that are discussed under health care related

     4           categories on America Online?

     5           A   Generally speaking, that could be in the health, health

     6           category of our service, it could be in other areas, there

     7           are a number of magazines on the Newsstand that we talked

     8           about earlier, particularly women's magazines and others that

     9           might contain, you know, those types of discussions. 

    10           Certainly Chatroom anywhere the service could contain

    11           discussions about these illustrative examples.

    12           Q   Now, is it fair to say, based on your understanding, that

    13           the context of discussing these topics that I've just

    14           mentioned in Paragraph 11, that the context of discussing

    15           these topics is to educate America Online subscribers as to

    16           these health care issues?

    17           A   Yes, the context is essentially education or it's

    18           dialogue, it's real time dialogue between individual members

    19           who have an interest in those topics.

    20           Q   Education, a dialogue on those health care topics, is

    21           that correct?

    22           A   That's correct.

    23           Q   With respect to, as you describe it, spectacular

    24           masterpieces from galleries and landmarks across the globe

    25           that contain nude figures, does America Online provide


                                                                            26

     1           subscribers with access to this type of material through

     2           publications such as Smithsonian Magazine?

     3           A   Yes, it could either be through a publication like

     4           Smithsonian that we may have contracted to have on our

     5           service or it could be through access to the Internet and

     6           Webpages or a number of museums and galleries have their own

     7           Webpages now that are accessible via the Internet.

     8           Q   This is the first instance I'm going to ask you to look

     9           at our exhibits.  Exhibit 102 is the declaration from Sheila

    10           Burke.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  102.    Would you give the Court a

    12           minute to find it?

    13                    (Pause.)

    14                    MR. COPPOLINO:  This is Volume 3.

    15                    (Pause.)

    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I'm sorry you're missing this

    17           affidavit, your Honor?  I have an extra, if you need it.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, no, that's all right, go

    19           ahead.  I'll share with Judge Dalzell.

    20           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    21           Q   I'm just going to refer to Paragraph 6 of the Burke

    22           affidavit which is at Exhibit 102, Defendant's Exhibit 102. 

    23           There's also a reference at the end of Paragraph 6 which is

    24           very similar to the paragraph you signed to written and

    25           visual depictions of remote tribes in South America from our


                                                                            27

     1           National Geographic section.  National Geographic is no

     2           longer available on America Online, is that correct?

     3           A   Yes, it is correct.

     4           Q   If another magazine such as, for example, Smithsonian,

     5           contained depictions of remote tribes, for example, with

     6           little or no clothing, would this also be the type of

     7           material that you believe subject -- might subject America

     8           Online to liability under the Communications Decency Act?

     9           A   Absolutely.

    10           Q   I think that's it on that exhibit, for now.

    11                    A few moments ago Judge Sloviter was asking you

    12           about whether Penthouse was on line and I asked you about

    13           that and you indicated it was not.  You said something in

    14           your answer to her that I wanted to ask you about, that

    15           you've not included publications such as Playboy and

    16           Penthouse based on business reasons and based on what our

    17           members want.  Was that your testimony?

    18           A   Yes, it was.

    19           Q   Does America Online feel that it is not appropriate to

    20           have that kind of content within its service because there

    21           are families and children on line?

    22           A   We make business and marketing judgments, you know, as

    23           the service evolves about the kind of content that we think

    24           the vast majority of our members would like to have, yes.

    25           Q   Well, just to clarify the point, maybe you should take a


                                                                            28

     1           look at Page 142 of your deposition.  

     2                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I have extra copies of the

     3           deposition if you'd like them, but last time we didn't, the

     4           Court didn't ask for them.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Not yet.

     6           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

     7           Q   On Page 142, do you have 142, Mr. Burrington?

     8           A   Yes, I do.

     9           Q   About halfway down I asked you this question, this is at

    10           our deposition on March 27th:  "What is it about that type of

    11           content," referring to Playboy and Penthouse "that led you to

    12           decide not to offer it to your members?"  That was the

    13           question.

    14                    Answer: "Because we have a variety of members and a

    15           number of families that use our service and have children, we

    16           just do not feel that kind of content was appropriate to have

    17           on our service."

    18                    Was that your testimony?

    19           A   Yes, it was.

    20           Q   Okay.  Mr. Burrington, America Online has something

    21           referred to as a -- as terms of service and rules of the

    22           road, is that correct?

    23           A   Yes, it is.

    24           Q   And these terms of service and rules of the road in part

    25           advise America Online subscribers what the subscribers may


                                                                            29

     1           not post on America Online, is that correct?

     2           A   Yes, they do.

     3           Q   Take a look at Exhibits 100-- Defendants' Exhibits in

     4           that Volume 3, 106 and 107?

     5                    (Pause.)

     6                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Can I proceed?

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, that's all right.

     8           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

     9           Q   Mr. Burrington, you recall I showed you Exhibits 106 and

    10           107 at your deposition?

    11           A   Yes, I do recall that.

    12           Q   At the bottom you'll see they're also marked Burrington

    13           Exhibit No. 19 and Burrington Exhibit No. 20, is that

    14           correct?

    15           A   Yes.

    16           Q   Do you recall whether to the best of your knowledge these

    17           documents reflect what the America Online terms of service

    18           and rules of the road look like?

    19           A   Yes. 

    20           Q   Would you look at Page 2 of the terms of service which is

    21           Exhibit 106 and I'm going to refer you to Paragraph 4 which

    22           is encaptioned "Rights and Responsibilities."  I'm going to

    23           refer  you to the last sentence of that which I'll read for

    24           the record.  It indicates "AOL, Inc. does not pre-screen

    25           content as a matter of policy, but AOL, Inc. and ICP shall


                                                                            30

     1           have the right but not the responsibility to remove content

     2           which is deemed in their discretion harmful, offensive or

     3           otherwise in violation of the TOS and ROR," referring to

     4           Terms of Service and Rules of the Road.

     5                    Does this reflect America Online's current policy?

     6           A   Yes, it does.

     7           Q   Would you look at the next -- I'm sorry, let's see. 

     8           Yeah, the next exhibit, No. 107, on Page 5.  Page 5 begins

     9           with Caption C, "On-line conduct."  

    10                    And under Caption C, "On-line conduct," it

    11           indicates, does it not, that a subscriber to America Online

    12           may not post or use America Online to do a number of things

    13           listed at one through ten, is that correct?

    14           A   That's correct.

    15           Q   And Item 2 is -- let me read it for the record: "Post or

    16           transmit sexually explicit images or other content which is

    17           deemed by AOL, Inc. to be offensive."  Is that a current rule

    18           of the road on America Online?

    19           A   That's a current rule of the road that we as a, you know,

    20           as a company, a private service have decided we want as part

    21           of our sort of community.  I need to explain that term, I

    22           think it's important.  We are a community of five million

    23           people and that's how we look at it.  And I think America

    24           Online more than really most of the other services really is

    25           aware of and really promotes this concept of community, just


                                                                            31

     1           like a physical community.  So we have in our community of

     2           five million people developed some basic rules, based upon

     3           what we want our service to be and that's what you're really

     4           seeing here reflected in these, in the Rules of the Road.

     5           Q   Item 3, the next item down on Page 5, indicates that "An

     6           America Online subscriber may not transmit any unlawful,

     7           harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar,

     8           obscene, hateful, racially, ethnically or otherwise

     9           objectionable content."  To the best of your knowledge is

    10           that still a current Rule of the Road?

    11           A   Yes, it is.

    12           Q   And if you look at Page 6 of the same document, very next

    13           page, the Item 3 encaptioned "Graphic Files," which indicates

    14           "America Online, Inc. prohibits the transfer or posting on

    15           America Online of sexually explicit images or other content

    16           deemed offensive by America Online, Inc."  Is that still a

    17           current Rule of the Road?

    18           A   Yes, it is.

    19           Q   Where would it be most likely that a subscriber might

    20           post a sexually explicit graphical image on America Online?

    21           A   If that's going to occur, the likely place is usually in

    22           one-to-one private electronic mail.  In other words, you can

    23           send an electronic mail message to somebody, and we have a

    24           capability through a little button you click on, to attach a

    25           file.  It will say "Attach file" and then you can go into


                                                                            32

     1           your computer, search for the file you want to attach, in

     2           this case -- I'm giving you a hypothetical -- it could be a

     3           graphic file of some type, it could be a picture or whatever,

     4           and -- or document -- and then you can transmit that to that

     5           person.  It's a private, one-to-one E-mail exchange.

     6           Q   You say private one-to-one E-mail.  Is it also the case

     7           that that one-to-one E-mail could be sent to a number of

     8           users, is that correct?

     9           A   Yes, you could address that letter, if you will, that

    10           electronic letter to a number of people, yes, that's correct.

    11           Q   And what would you need to know to send that E-mail to an

    12           America Online subscriber?

    13           A   You would need to know that subscriber's electronic mail

    14           address, just like any other physical letter.

    15           Q   If you're on America Online, you'd need to know their

    16           screen name, is that correct?

    17           A   That's correct.

    18           Q   Where would it be most likely to --

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Their what name?

    20                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Oh, I referred to it as a screen

    21           name, your Honor.

    22           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    23           Q   Why don't you briefly explain what a screen name is?

    24           A   Right, just not to -- not to confuse things here, but 

    25           we--


                                                                            33

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's not the subscriber number,

     2           that's not the password, is it?

     3                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Not a password, your Honor.  I think

     4           Mr. Burrington should explain that.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, I think so.

     6                    THE WITNESS:  In the broad vernacular of the

     7           Internet, we all, those of us who are on the Internet have an

     8           electronic mail Internet address.  And you'll see that often

     9           as in my case, Bill Burr, at, with a little at sign, AOL.COM

    10           and that just tells the world that I'm an AOL subscriber. 

    11           And that's how somebody who is on the Internet who is not an

    12           AOL subscriber can get to me by sending me an E-mail.  Within

    13           the AOL system, we operate on a system that are called screen

    14           names which means when you first sign on to America Online,

    15           you first subscribe, you get to pick a screen name.  And

    16           that's the people who are -- the ones that can set up

    17           accounts have to be adults and so they are what we call the

    18           master account holder and they may pick a screen name,

    19           whatever they want it to be.  It could be their own name or

    20           it could be whatever name they want.  

    21                    And then when you're sending electronic mail within

    22           our closed, private network, all you need to do is type your

    23           screen name.  So just like when you're addressing a letter

    24           where you say to and you put in Bill Burr, in my case, and

    25           then I can -- well, I guess I could send mail to myself, but


                                                                            34

     1           I would send mail to someone else using that screen name.

     2                    And then the password is something else you have to

     3           have, obviously, in order to once you've put in your screen

     4           name to access the service, you have to have your password as

     5           well in order to get in.

     6           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

     7           Q   So if you're an America Online subscriber I only need

     8           your screen name to send you an E-mail, is that correct?

     9           A   That is correct.

    10           Q   And otherwise the -- is it the case that for every AOL

    11           subscriber the remainder of the E-mail address is simply at

    12           AOL.COM, is that correct?

    13           A   Yes. 

    14           Q   Where would it be most likely -- would it be most likely

    15           that a subscriber might post harmful or vulgar language in

    16           the same way, through E-mail?

    17           A   I think that's one place that that type of language could

    18           be posted, if you will, and I think that there are other

    19           areas out on the Internet like news groups that we've talked

    20           about previously.  Sometimes it would be possible in the live

    21           chat rooms that are happening in, you know, real time, there

    22           are live conversations back and forth with a number of people

    23           that that could possibly be there as well.

    24           Q   Why don't you remind the Court what a chat room is and

    25           how it operates?


                                                                            35

     1           A   Okay, let me walk through that briefly.  When we were

     2           looking earlier at Exhibit -- Plaintiffs' Exhibit 292 there

     3           was a reference to the People Connection.  And if you click

     4           on the People Connection, we have three types of what we call

     5           chat rooms.  And basically America Online has created its own

     6           set of we call them AOL-created rooms because we decided, you

     7           know, here are several hundred topics we think people want to

     8           talk about, from sports to cooking to whatever.

     9                    And those rooms are created by us, we title them, if

    10           you get into America Online and hit People Connection, you

    11           will go first into a lobby and then you can just, you're in

    12           electronic lobby and then you can get yourself into one of

    13           those rooms.  And again we create those, up to 23 people can

    14           be in one of those rooms at a time simultaneously and then

    15           you essentially type messages back and forth and it's

    16           happening, you know, instantaneously.

    17                    The second category in addition to the AOL-created

    18           rooms are what we call  member-created rooms and that is

    19           subscribers who are allowed to create their own room.  Maybe

    20           they don't want to talk just generally about cooking but they

    21           want to talk about French cooking, so they will create a room

    22           called French cooking.  

    23                    In any given night there will be anywhere from 800

    24           to 1500 of those rooms with up to 23 people in them

    25           simultaneously chatting back and forth and we scroll through


                                                                            36

     1           the titles of those rooms to make sure that they at least

     2           conform to our terms of service.  

     3                    Not to confuse things, but then there is the third

     4           category, in addition to AOL-created rooms and member-created

     5           rooms, we have a thing called private rooms and that is most

     6           useful, I think, for and I'm aware of families that have

     7           maybe kids around the country in college or whatever and you

     8           can actually set up a room name, a private room with like

     9           your last name and then your family could sign on anywhere

    10           that they have the AOL service and you could have a

    11           simultaneously -- simultaneous live, you know, conversation

    12           sort of conference call.

    13                    But the only people that can access those rooms are

    14           the ones that actually know the name of the room, they'd have

    15           to affirmatively type it in.  So it's kind of like a little

    16           secret, you know, password or the password into the

    17           clubhouse, so to speak.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  How would you know the content of

    19           those private chat rooms?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  We don't.  We cannot, unless we --

    21           first of all, we don't know the names of those rooms.  I

    22           would not know, our service would not know, for example, your

    23           Honor, that you maybe created a private room with your last

    24           name, for example, we wouldn't know that.  So --

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Very small.


                                                                            37

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Pardon me?

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Would be a very small room --

     3                    (Laughter.)

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Go ahead.

     5                    THE WITNESS:  If -- well, you'd have to tell

     6           somebody about it, too.  But if they, you know, let's say

     7           there were four of you in there talking, I mean unless we

     8           happen to stumble across there, somebody said, you know, this

     9           room name has been created, we would not have any way of

    10           getting into that room and knowing the content.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But to get at the heart of this

    12           case instead of all of this, if it's all right, is there

    13           anything that would prevent private people on this little

    14           private chat room from exchanging what would be obscene? 

    15           Leave aside what may be patently offensive or indecent, would

    16           there -- what would, other than your Rules of the Game, what

    17           is there that would prevent electronic transmission of such

    18           material? 

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Well, first of all, your Honor, that's

    20           a very good question.  There are a number of mechanisms

    21           there.  First of all, and if you're talking about the private

    22           room context right now, they cannot --

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah.

    24                    THE WITNESS:  -- people can't exchange graphics

    25           files, for example, in a private room, it's just merely


                                                                            38

     1           discussion back and forth.  You have to type out a sentence

     2           and then send it and somebody else types out a sentence and

     3           responds.  You can't send things, so to speak, back and forth

     4           in that context. 

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, I think Judge Sloviter's

     6           question was you could send obscene language, I assume?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  I -- yes, as I -- yes, you could,

     8           certainly.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You could describe sexual activity.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  You could, in a private room, yes, you

    11           could.  The -- but the beauty of at least with the America

    12           Online and most of the other services is that  a parent has

    13           the ability, in the context of this case that we're talking

    14           about, to go into our parental control tools, which I believe

    15           we'll be discussing, and block access to all of those rooms. 

    16           They can block access just to private rooms, if they want, so

    17           that their kids could never even get into a private room.

    18                    They can block access to member-created rooms only. 

    19           They may want their kids to have access to the AOL rooms

    20           because we monitor those much more closely because they're

    21           our rooms  or they might say I don't want my children to have

    22           access to any of the chat rooms that America Online offers,

    23           so you just click on that button and your children cannot get

    24           into these rooms.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Should these all have a prefix?  Is


                                                                            39

     1           there some way in which you can distinguish, it came up in

     2           your declaration and it was unclear, is there some way you

     3           can distinguish between America Online created chat rooms

     4           which are presumably checked at least for -- well, checked

     5           for content and other chat rooms which are checked for title

     6           and these very private sort of coded chat rooms, how would a

     7           parent know so that the parent could block out one but not

     8           the other?

     9                    There was some suggestion that that could be done,

    10           how could that be done technically?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, your Honor.  Let me describe that

    12           sort of, if you will, from both ends, meaning when you're a

    13           user in this -- you click on people connection and now you

    14           have before you the three possible kinds of chat rooms we

    15           just discussed.

    16                    You'll know when you're in AOL room because that's

    17           what you first get into, you very first are in the lobby and

    18           you can look through existing room names that we've created. 

    19           And we've changed them from time to time, but they are there

    20           and you know that's where you are.  Then you can click on

    21           another button that says member rooms and that's where you

    22           can see what currently is -- you know, and they change

    23           literally by the second.  I mean, during the evening there's

    24           just, they come, they go, people create them, people close

    25           them down.  And that's why I said there's anywhere from 800


                                                                            40

     1           to, you know, up to 1500 of these rooms and then you also

     2           have a chance to click on a button that says create private

     3           room. 

     4                    Now, that's from the user perspective, from the

     5           parents' perspective, when they're utilizing our parental

     6           control tools, they have a very simple screen in front of

     7           them.  And maybe I can, if I may, can I refer to the -- my

     8           plaintiffs exhibit there to show that screen?  I think it

     9           might be helpful.  This is Plaintiff's Exhibit 285 which is

    10           the parental control screen shots, 285.

    11                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, does the Court wish to

    12           do this now?  I was going to ask some questions about this.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, yeah.  You're not -- you've

    14           answered my question and I think this is Mr. Coppolino's

    15           questioning. 

    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Thank you, your Honor, that's fine.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  With the assistance of the Court or

    18           otherwise.  Go ahead, Mr. Coppolino.

    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Okay, we will get that exhibit to

    20           you very shortly because I do want the Court to see that.

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Right.

    22           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    23           Q   But let me just wrap up a couple of points here on chat

    24           rooms, first of all.

    25           A   Mm-hmm.


                                                                            41

     1           Q   The -- the topics for AOL-created chat rooms and member

     2           chat rooms are available or viewable by all AOL subscribers,

     3           is that correct?

     4           A   That's correct unless they have their access blocked to

     5           those rooms.

     6           Q   And the messages that are going back and forth in these

     7           chat rooms on the AOL-created and the member chat rooms are

     8           also viewable on the screens, is that correct?

     9           A   If a member who's not had access blocked were to go into

    10           a room, yes, they could see the chat going back and forth,

    11           yes.

    12           Q   A moment ago I asked you about your policy with respect

    13           to sexually explicit graphical images.  Could you describe

    14           for the Court what sexually explicit images means under

    15           America Online's Rules of the Road?

    16           A   It's a -- a term that certainly would include child

    17           pornography, what I think we would all agree in terms of the

    18           legal obscenity.  Generally speaking, the rule of thumb for

    19           us is any kind of full frontal nudity we would consider to be

    20           sexually explicit.

    21           Q   I believe I also asked you at your deposition whether you

    22           thought that would also include depictions of actual sexual

    23           conduct, is that correct?

    24           A   If it was depicted as, yes, I mean if it was clear what

    25           it was.


                                                                            42

     1           Q   Let's take a look at Page 14 of the Burrington

     2           declaration.  Paragraph 14 indicates that, at the outset that

     3           the most basic parental control is the membership system

     4           itself, that no one can become a member without furnishing a

     5           credit card or, on some occasions, a checking account to be

     6           debited for payment and that the applicant must also certify

     7           that he or she is over 18.  Is that correct?

     8           A   That is correct.

     9           Q   Then it then indicates that the person who signs up with

    10           a credit card becomes a master account holder and holds a

    11           master password, is that correct?

    12           A   Yes.

    13           Q   We're going to get into some of the specific workings of

    14           the controls in a moment, but would you just simply indicate

    15           for now whether America Online has parental controls that

    16           apply to Internet Usnet groups?

    17           A   Yes.  America Online does have parental controls that

    18           apply to the news groups.

    19           Q   And I believe you just testified that America Online has

    20           parental controls that apply to so-called chat rooms, is that

    21           correct?

    22           A   That's correct.

    23           Q   America Online also has a parental control feature known

    24           as Kids Only, is that correct?

    25           A   That's correct.


                                                                            43

     1           Q   And that is an area of America Online which has been

     2           created by America Online containing content suitable for

     3           children between six and 13, is that correct?

     4           A   I believe six and 12, actually, but that's correct.

     5           Q   So news groups, chat rooms and kids only, those are the

     6           major services to which America Online controls apply, is

     7           that correct?

     8           A   There are a few additional ones in addition to those, one

     9           is the so-called what we call binary downloads which are,

    10           again, if you're in a news group and you can get a graphics

    11           file, you can actually go in there and get a graphics

    12           computer file and download it into your computer so you can

    13           view it.  You can block access to all of those on the

    14           Internet. 

    15                    You also can block access to what we call Instant

    16           Messaging or IM and Instant Messaging is again just a feature

    17           of our private service which allows me to, if I know your

    18           screen name, to send you an instant message, it will pop up

    19           on your screen saying, you know, hi, how are you, and then

    20           you can have a conversation back and forth.

    21                    Our parents and our research and continuing dialogue

    22           with parents, we've been told that they would like the

    23           ability to prevent their children or sometimes adults don't

    24           want to get hassled with instant messages popping up on their

    25           screen, so those are the two additional features.


                                                                            44

     1           Q   Now let's take a look at Exhibit 285, this is Plaintiffs'

     2           Exhibit.  I'm just going to refer you to the first screen,

     3           the first page of 285.  Do you have that, Mr. Burrington?

     4           A   Yes, I do.

     5           Q   The caption is "Parental Controls," is that correct?

     6           A   That's correct. 

     7           Q   In the lower right-hand corner there are three Icons. 

     8           One says "Block all but kids only," one says "Chat controls"

     9           and one says "News group controls."  Are those the three

    10           major categories of parental controls available on America

    11           Online?

    12           A   At this time, yes.

    13           Q   Other than for USNet groups that we discussed a moment

    14           ago, does America Online presently have parental controls

    15           that apply to Internet sites such as the Worldwide Web?

    16           A   We do not at this time have specific blocking for

    17           Worldwide Web, but I think to be fair in that answer, a

    18           number of the other on-line companies such as Prodigy and

    19           Compuserve have entered into agreements with Cyber Patrol and

    20           there are other third-party software programs out there that

    21           do specifically allow the blocking of Worldwide Web sites.

    22                    And we will be very shortly, since this is a very

    23           rapidly evolving technology and industry, will be offering

    24           those as well sometime this summer.

    25                    So that to be accurate, you will be able to block


                                                                            45

     1           access to Worldwide Web sites.

     2           Q   Presently the only controls that America Online has for

     3           the Internet concern the USNet groups, is that correct?

     4           A   The USNet news groups and the binary download, graphic

     5           file download feature we talked about, yes.

     6           Q   Binaries that are on the USNet news groups?

     7           A   That's correct.

     8           Q   Take a look at the sixth page of this Exhibit 285, they

     9           are not numbered, but it is the page that says "News Groups,"

    10           news groups on it, there's actually three subpages, it's

    11           "Parental Controls, News Groups Controls" and then the third

    12           page is "News Groups."  I believe it's the sixth page in. 

    13           This is the one I'm referring to.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The one that says "News Groups" or

    15           "News Group Controls?"

    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  News Groups. 

    17           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    18           Q   Do you have that, Mr. Burrington?

    19           A   Yes, I do.

    20           Q   Is this what the news group menu looks like on America

    21           Online?

    22           A   Yes, it does.

    23           Q   Does America Online make available to its subscribers

    24           virtually all of the USNet news groups, is that correct?

    25           A   That's correct.


                                                                            46

     1           Q   If you look at Defendants' Exhibit 119 which is in that

     2           third volume that I provided you, I'm not going to read every

     3           word of this but I just wanted to refer the witness to it.

     4                    Exhibit 119, do you recall testifying at your

     5           deposition that this is a long list of what appears to be the

     6           type of news groups that America Online makes available to

     7           its subscribers, correct?

     8           A   Yes, these are the types of news groups that are

     9           available out on the Internet that all of the on-line

    10           services provide some sort of access to.

    11           Q   Thank you.

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  That's all I'm going to do with that

    13           exhibit, your Honor.

    14           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    15           Q   The -- the Icon called Search All Newsgroups --

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  How many are there -- excuse me,

    17           how many are there of these, does he have any idea, roughly? 

    18           It seems to be a lot in --

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Your Honor, that is accurate, there

    20           are probably around up to 20,000 news groups today.  They

    21           again come and go, they can be created right as we're sitting

    22           here or they can be deleted.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I thought it was stipulated that

    24           there were about 30,000?

    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I thought it was 15,000, your Honor,


                                                                            47

     1           but we have a stipulation.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, they are not.    

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's in the stipulation.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  In the vernacular. 

     5                    (Laughter.)    

     6           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

     7           Q   The option on the right called -- the lower right called

     8           "Search All News Groups," does this enable an America Online

     9           user to search all of the Internet news groups such as those

    10           listed in Exhibit 119?

    11           A   Yes, I -- with the qualification of the, when you become

    12           an AOL subscriber by default the index, the so-called index

    13           of -- much like what you just showed in the previous exhibit,

    14           is not readily available.  You actually have to go into

    15           parental controls and opt to have that index become visual. 

    16           In other words, it's out there but it doesn't visually appear

    17           unless you affirmatively opt in to have that happen. 

    18                    But then you are able to, once you've done that, you

    19           would click on the Search All News Groups and put in key

    20           words and you would pull up news groups.

    21           Q   And is it correct that once an AOL member has picked the

    22           news groups that he or she wishes to read regularly, they

    23           click on the Icon that says "Read My News Groups" and a

    24           listing of the news groups they had chosen would appear, is

    25           that correct?


                                                                            48

     1           A   Yes, had they used the what's called Expert Ad feature,

     2           which would basically -- Expert Ad just allows you to

     3           customize your list of news groups.  And you have to type in

     4           the full name of the news group and then that will be added

     5           to your list, yes.

     6           Q   Once that news group is made -- that the user selects, a

     7           particular news group, he can then further click on the news

     8           group and read the articles and messages that are posted

     9           there, is that correct?

    10           A   That's correct.

    11           Q   The articles and messages in the news groups often appear

    12           to look as if they were electronic mail messages, isn't that

    13           correct?

    14           A   Yes.

    15           Q   And once inside the news group the various articles and

    16           messages are listed separately, is that correct?

    17           A   That's correct.  Within each individual news group there

    18           will be anywhere from, you know, a couple hundred to

    19           thousands of individual postings. 

    20           Q   And to your knowledge most of the messages have what

    21           purports to be a short description of its content provided by

    22           the person who posted the message, is that correct?

    23           A   That's correct.

    24           Q   USNet news group articles can contain both text as well

    25           as graphical images or pictures, is that correct?


                                                                            49

     1           A   Yes, that's correct, you can attach to a -- a news group

     2           a posting, an actual graphics file that someone can download,

     3           yes.

     4           Q   For example, on Exhibit 119, if you'd like to refer to

     5           it, there is a news group on Page 750 called Alt Binaries

     6           Pictures.  Is it your understanding that binaries may include

     7           graphical images or pictures, is that correct?

     8           A   Right.  Generally speaking the term binaries means it is

     9           a graphic file and that's why when we have the "Block All

    10           Binaries" box we can prevent that.

    11           Q   Leaving side the content of the pictures for a moment,

    12           does America Online provide its subscribers with the means to

    13           download or view a picture from a news group?

    14           A   Yes, it does.

    15           Q   Could you describe the process whereby a user can go into

    16           a news group and click on a particular message and view and

    17           download a picture?

    18           A   Again, assuming those news groups are not blocked or if

    19           they are unblocked but the parent or someone has blocked to

    20           prevent binary downloads, let's assume that all of those

    21           blocking features are off, then you could go into a news

    22           group on any given topic, scroll through the hundreds of

    23           postings that may be in there and click, double click on one

    24           of those postings, open it up and there will be a little

    25           screen that will pop up, it will either have just text which


                                                                            50

     1           is the, you know, the text of the message and/or there may be

     2           attached to it a graphics file.  And you'll be -- you'll see

     3           on the bottom of your screen to click, you can click on that

     4           little box that says "download."  And then over a period of

     5           time the image will be downloaded  into your computer.

     6           Q   And the picture is actually -- comes up on the user's

     7           screen as the image is downloading, is that correct?

     8           A   As the image is downloading, the screen, your computer

     9           screen would be painted, in a manner of speaking, with that

    10           picture, provided you had not used the blocking capabilities.

    11           Q   As a technical matter can America Online prevent its

    12           members from accessing a specific news group?

    13           A   Yes, we can.

    14           Q   In fact, I believe you testified at your deposition that

    15           America Online had removed certain news groups that contained

    16           child pornography, is that correct?

    17           A   There are a very, very small number of news group titles

    18           that were so obvious on their face, in our judgment, in terms

    19           of in one way or another dealing with illegal child

    20           pornography that we have chosen to block access to those

    21           rooms.

    22           Q   Do some of the other news groups that are available

    23           through America Online to your knowledge contain sexually

    24           explicit material, including graphical images?

    25           A   I believe they do, yes.


                                                                            51

     1           Q   In the course of your own professional research and

     2           duties have you ever searched a news group, any news group?

     3           A   Yes,  I have.

     4           Q   And in the course of your duties have you ever

     5           encountered a news group which would contain a nude graphical

     6           image?

     7           A   Yes, I have.

     8           Q   And in the course of your duties have you ever

     9           encountered a news group which contains a sexually explicit

    10           graphical image?

    11           A   I have not personally recalled seeing those, but I'm sure

    12           that they're there.

    13           Q   Turning to Paragraph 15, referring to the sentence on

    14           Page 8, second, the last sentence, it says that "The adult

    15           member's master password must be entered in order to turn the

    16           parental controls on and off to alter their settings," is

    17           that correct?

    18           A   That's correct.

    19           Q   Is it correct to say that the basic concept underlying

    20           America Online's parental controls is the establishment of a

    21           separate screen name and password for children by whoever is

    22           the master account holder, is that correct?

    23           A   Right, for both America Online and some of the other

    24           commercial services you, in order to sign up as we discussed

    25           earlier, you have to be 18 years of age or older with a


                                                                            52

     1           credit card or, in our case, we also offer checking account

     2           debiting.  And once you select that screen name, your initial

     3           screen name is the master account holder, the adult 18 years

     4           of age or older, you can never -- you can never change it. 

     5           You can never, ever change that screen name and then you're

     6           allowed to create an additional four screen names under that

     7           master account that could be designated for your children and

     8           they could each have their own password as well.

     9           Q   And again the key concept of the parental controls is the

    10           establishment of a separate screen name for children, is that

    11           correct?

    12           A   That's correct, because the controls are applied to those

    13           screen names and, I might add, some adults choose to apply

    14           them to themselves as well.

    15           Q   Looking back at Exhibit 285 it's the page immediately

    16           following the news group page I just referred to.  This is

    17           plaintiffs' exhibit and those particular pages are not

    18           numbered, but it's the page which has the word "Parental

    19           Controls" on top, edit parental controls for which screen.  

    20                    Do you see that, Mr. Burrington?

    21           A   Yes, I do.

    22           Q   Does this page show how a parent can edit news group

    23           controls for a child with a separate screen name?

    24           A   Yes, in the example before you in this exhibit the master

    25           account holder in this case is the screen name R. Gersky, and


                                                                            53

     1           then they have created a fictional children's sub-account

     2           screen name called Child Demo.

     3           Q   Will you look at the next page, please, says blocking

     4           criteria?  Is it fair to characterize this that the master

     5           account holder has the option of blocking all news groups,

     6           blocking binary downloads, blocking news groups based on

     7           certain names in the title or blocking specific news groups. 

     8           Is that an accurate summary of the options available there?

     9           A   Yes, it is.

    10           Q   Do you understand, as a technical matter, how the

    11           blocking of news groups works, that is what is actually

    12           happening on the network system that allows the groups to be

    13           blocked?

    14           A   Are you speaking now in terms of the inner workings of

    15           what the computers --

    16           Q   Yes.

    17           A   -- are doing --

    18           Q   Yes.

    19           A   -- inside of themselves?  No, I do not know precisely how

    20           that works.

    21           Q   If a separate screen name is not established for a child

    22           and the child is on-line through the master account holder's

    23           password, could the parental control features be altered?

    24           A   If -- and this is why we educate parents to not allow

    25           their children to use their master account and the key to


                                                                            54

     1           that is keeping your password private.  And we regularly

     2           remind parents and subscribers as they sign on and sign off

     3           of AOL to change their password frequently.  Yes, it is

     4           possible if a parent were to allow their children to have

     5           access to that screen name, their own screen name, and give

     6           them the password, that they could access it similar to --

     7           Q   Is -- sorry.

     8           A   -- similar to leaving keys in the car in the garage. 

     9           Q   If the child is on line through the master account

    10           holder's password the parental control features can be

    11           altered, is that correct?

    12           A   The person who is using the master account, yes, could go

    13           in conceivably and alter the settings for these parental

    14           controls.

    15           Q   The person who was on line through the master account, is

    16           that correct?

    17           A   Yes, yes.

    18           Q   And the controls could also be disabled, is that correct?

    19           A   That's correct.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is that a technical -- is that the

    21           technically difficult thing to do or is it just like turning

    22           a switch?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Assuming, your Honor, that you have

    24           the password to get into that master account, which is

    25           critical here, then once you're in there the interface, as


                                                                            55

     1           we've seen from some of these screen shots, is fairly simple

     2           and you're clicking off and clicking on.

     3           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

     4           Q   In fact, if you look at the two pages I just referred you

     5           to on parental controls, the user could, assuming you're on

     6           through the master account holder, the user could go into the

     7           edit mode and simply click off where the controls are enacted

     8           for the particular child, is that correct?

     9           A   Right.  I mean you're speaking hypothetically.  We have

    10           not in our experience had that as a practice, that parents

    11           are frankly handing out their password to their children. 

    12           Q   I'm asking as a technical matter how it's done.

    13           A   As a technical matter?

    14           Q   I'm asking as a technical matter because Judge Dalzell

    15           had-- I mean, excuse me -- Judge Sloviter had asked the

    16           question as to how easy it is to do.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  He's more restrained today.

    18                    (Laughter.)

    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Excuse me.

    20           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    21           Q   For this screen that I'm referring to in Exhibit 285 you

    22           simply click off the screen that's marked with a dark -- with

    23           a dot in that circle, is that correct?

    24           A   With the -- I'm sorry, you're on a different page than I

    25           am now.


                                                                            56

     1           Q   Yes, let's look at the page --

     2           A   Okay.

     3           Q   -- with the "Edit Parental Controls" for which screen

     4           name.

     5           A   Mm-hmm.

     6           Q   Simply edit that out, is that correct, by removing -- you

     7           can hit the edit function and remove the dot for where it

     8           says "Child Demo One"?

     9           A   No, that's not how that would work. You have to

    10           affirmatively click on the particular subscreen name that you

    11           want to edit, then you would have to go in and actually edit

    12           it.

    13           Q   Well, let's look at the next page on blocking criteria

    14           then. You can edit each one of these blocking criterias by

    15           removing the X in the box, is that correct, where it says

    16           "Block expert ad, block news groups?"

    17           A   That's correct.

    18           Q   Block binary downloads, you simply go in and click off

    19           the X, is that right?

    20           A   You can click off the X's or, in the case of the two

    21           boxes below, you could delete the text that's in there.

    22           Q   Is it fair to say that the establishment of a separate

    23           screen name and password for a child must be done or must be

    24           undertaken in order for the parental controls to be

    25           effectively utilized?


                                                                            57

     1           A   Well, that's generally true unless the parent -- the

     2           parents wants to -- the master account holder parent wants to

     3           sit with their child while they're on their own master

     4           account screening, which frequently our parents do.  But the

     5           other option, depending on the age of the child, is to give

     6           the child their own screen name and their own password and

     7           that is what these controls would apply to.

     8           Q   But is it fair to say that the establishment of a

     9           separate screen name and password is necessary for the

    10           controls to be effectively utilized?

    11           A   That is -- that is an accurate statement, yes; it is not

    12           the only option.

    13           Q   Paragraph 25 of your declaration indicates that --

    14           looking at the very first sentence -- indicates that

    15           Compuserve and Prodigy give their subscribers the option of

    16           blocking all access to the Internet.  Does America Online

    17           provide that option for all subscribers?

    18           A   As I test-- as I testified earlier, we at this time do

    19           not.  We do provide partial blocking, but I indicated to you

    20           that many of us, because this has become a competitive issue,

    21           are essentially offering a lot of the same tools, so by early

    22           this summer we will have that feature.

    23           Q   Paragraph 25 also indicates that Prodigy requires a

    24           parent to affirmatively turn on access to Internet news

    25           groups.  Does America Online have this feature?


                                                                            58

     1           A   In a manner of speaking, as I testified earlier, there

     2           is, we do not make the index of all the rooms available, you

     3           have to affirmatively turn that list on.  So you would have

     4           to know the actual full name of the news group and enter it

     5           into "Expert Ad" in order for you to be able to access it if

     6           it was not blocked by us.

     7           Q   Well, I understand you're also testifying on behalf of

     8           the industry in general so let me see if you have an answer

     9           to this question regarding Prodigy.  Do you know if Prodigy's

    10           particular option here means that when you go on line, all of

    11           the -- all access to news groups is effectively off and you

    12           have to turn it on affirmatively?

    13           A   I believe that is the case, yes.

    14           Q   So that the default on Prodigy is that news groups are

    15           off, is that correct?

    16           A   That's correct.

    17           Q   To your knowledge is that particular type of system where

    18           the default is off technically feasible on America Online?

    19           A   I believe it is, yes.

    20           Q   Do the news group controls that we've just been

    21           discussing, for example, those that block binary downloads,

    22           do those controls apply to graphical images that are

    23           transmitted over electronic mail?

    24           A   I do believe that, and I'm part of a team within AOL that

    25           is looking at enhancing a variety of aspects of our service


                                                                            59

     1           including parental controls, and I do believe that there is

     2           and will be soon the capability to -- for any user, adult or

     3           child, to -- you can receive an E-mail but you wouldn't be

     4           able to download whatever was attached to it.  And the reason

     5           that we are developing that is that there are given the

     6           incredible volume and growth globally of this medium, there

     7           are a number of files that are transmitted that contain

     8           viruses.  And you could unknowingly download a graphic file

     9           containing a computer virus onto your own computer which

    10           would not be a good thing.

    11           Q   Just to clarify the point, as of today do the parental

    12           controls which block binary downloads apply to electronic

    13           mail transmissions on America Online?

    14           A   My understanding is that they only apply to news groups.

    15           Q   Could a America Online subscriber send an E-mail to

    16           another America Online subscriber that contains a sexually

    17           explicit graphic image?

    18           A   They could but it would be violative of our terms of

    19           service.

    20           Q   I believe you testified that the parental control

    21           measures we've been discussing do not currently apply to

    22           Worldwide Web sites on the Internet other than the news

    23           groups, is that correct?

    24           A   If you're speaking of America Online?

    25           Q   Yes.


                                                                            60

     1           A   Directly, yes, that is true.

     2           Q   Are you familiar with the entity called Surfwatch?

     3           A   Yes, I am generally.

     4           Q   Could you take a look at Exhibit 109, this is Defendants'

     5           Exhibit 109 in the Volume 3 that I gave you?

     6                    (Pause.)

     7           Q   If you recall, I showed you this exhibit at your

     8           deposition.

     9           A   Yes, I do.

    10           Q   It indicates that in July of 1995 Surfwatch announced

    11           that it signed a letter of intent with America Online to

    12           provide additional capability to AOL's parental control

    13           feature.  Do you recall testifying at your deposition that

    14           America Online's discussions with Surfwatch in connection

    15           with that letter of intent had ended, do you recall that?

    16           A   Yes, I do.

    17           Q   And do you recall testifying that they had ended because

    18           of significant technical hurdles or obstacles that Surfwatch

    19           could not overcome in order to be compatible with America

    20           Online's system, do you recall that testimony?

    21           A   Yes, I do.  At that time which was, what, about nine

    22           months ago which in this business is a lifetime, at that time

    23           nine months ago we were having some technical compatibility

    24           problems which I believe have since been corrected, so we are

    25           discussing things with them again.


                                                                            61

     1           Q   There are new discussions with America Online in order to

     2           extend parental controls to Internet Websites, is that

     3           correct?

     4           A   That's correct.  Since that time in July of '95 we've had

     5           a working group that I've been involved with exploring the

     6           variety of third-party software applications that are on the

     7           market today or in development.  And because of the size of

     8           our network and a number of other complicated technical

     9           reasons, we've had to very carefully look at each one to see

    10           which would be compatible and which would not.

    11           Q   I could refer you to the exact page if you need me to,

    12           but do you recall also testifying that America Online hopes

    13           to have the additional parental controls that you've just

    14           been discussing available for the Internet sites by July of

    15           1996, was that your testimony?

    16           A   That is my understanding as of, in fact, last week we had

    17           come very close to nailing down the exact configuration of

    18           software we would offer free to  our members.

    19           Q   Let me back up to a point I should have covered a moment

    20           ago.  With respect to the sexually explicit images that may

    21           be E-mailed over the electronic mail service, have users ever

    22           complained to America Online to your knowledge regarding the

    23           transmission of sexually explicit images over E-mail?

    24           A   We have received complaints and the way we operate, as I

    25           mentioned earlier, as a community, we have places that people


                                                                            62

     1           can go to turn in those complaints and then we will look at

     2           the material, provided we have it, and if it violates our

     3           terms of service, the member will be terminated.  If it's

     4           something considered illegal, we will turn that information

     5           over to the Federal law enforcement authorities.

     6           Q   Are you able to give the Court a sense of how often, how

     7           frequently such complaints are received?  Is it many, few,

     8           what's your estimate on that?

     9           A   My estimate would be, based on being directly involved

    10           with a lot of these, is that it's a relatively small, it's a

    11           few complaints but the key is we try to -- we try to

    12           encourage our members, as in any community, to go out and be

    13           aware of their surroundings and report suspicious activity.

    14                    And in an interesting way out of a city of five

    15           million people, if you look at it that way, our sort of

    16           informal electronic neighborhood watch program is working

    17           frankly much better than it does in my neighborhood in

    18           Washington, DC, in the physical world.

    19           Q   Referring to Paragraph 26 of your declaration, it

    20           indicates that Compuserve currently provides subscribers with

    21           free copies of Cyber Patrol and Prodigy will do so as well,

    22           is that correct?

    23           A   That's correct.

    24           Q   Do you know if Cyber Patrol is actually integrated into

    25           the Compuserve and Prodigy systems?


                                                                            63

     1           A   I do not know offhand, but I know that that's what has

     2           slowed up our consideration of these is we want to make this

     3           as simple and seamless as possible so that when you click on

     4           like our parental control screens, it will look very similar

     5           so that we don't confuse parents.

     6           Q   Do you know with respect to Cyber Patrol and Compuserve

     7           if the program has to be affirmatively turned on by

     8           subscribers who subscribe to those services?

     9           A   I do not know that directly, no, I don't.

    10           Q   Do you know if it is technically possible to configure

    11           that type of software on systems such as America Online and

    12           Compuserve and Prodigy such that it is on when the user signs

    13           on?

    14           A   I think it's possible technically to do that.  I think it

    15           becomes a business question, quite frankly, as to whether you

    16           wanted to do it that way or you want to, you know, make the

    17           vast majority of users have to unblock or disable that every

    18           time that they sign on.

    19           Q   Take a look at Exhibit 285 again, please, the first

    20           screen or the first page of Exhibit 285, which is the

    21           parental control screen, is that correct?

    22           A   Yes. 

    23           Q   There is a separate Icon on the screen called Message

    24           Boards, is that correct?

    25           A   Yes.


                                                                            64

     1           Q   Is this an area where messages can be sent back and forth

     2           between subscribers and America Online with questions and

     3           answers regarding parental controls?

     4           A   Yes, as part of our what we call our Community Action

     5           Program, we encourage parents to dialogue with each other as

     6           well as with our parental control staff people about

     7           questions they may have.  We have a number of places on the

     8           service where they can lodge those questions.

     9           Q   Do you recall at your deposition we went through a number

    10           of messages like this that I represented to you were

    11           downloaded from the Message Board area, do you recall that?

    12           A   I do recall that, yes.

    13           Q   I want to ask you about just two or three of them today. 

    14           Would you take a look first at Exhibit No. 96 of defendants'

    15           exhibits?

    16                    Do you have Exhibit No. 96, Mr. Burrington?

    17           A   Yes, I do.

    18           Q   To your knowledge is this an accurate description of how

    19           to remove America Online's parental controls after they've

    20           been installed?

    21           A   Yes, it is.

    22           Q   Keep the book handy because I have just a couple I also

    23           am going to refer to but, first, let me ask you, have you

    24           yourself ever been asked questions by parents as to the how

    25           the parental control features on America Online's on line


                                                                            65

     1           actually work?

     2           A   Have I personally?

     3           Q   Yeah, have you personally?

     4           A   In the course of my -- the kind of work I do in public

     5           affairs and externally I have talked to parents over time,

     6           yes.

     7           Q   If you could take a look at Exhibit No. 97 which, as you

     8           can see, was also Exhibit No. 12 at your deposition.  Have

     9           you ever been asked a question such as this by a newer user

    10           of America Online as to how Parental Controls work?

    11           A   Yes, in terms of the question of how do I create

    12           subscreen names and how do I create passwords for those, yes,

    13           I've answered those types of questions.

    14           Q   All right.  And we're not going to go through all of them

    15           again but take a look at No. 99 as well?  This was Exhibit

    16           No. 14 to your deposition.

    17           A   Mm-hmm.

    18           Q   Again, have you been asked questions such as this by

    19           parents as to how to set up a separate screen name and

    20           password for a child?

    21           A   Yes, as I just testified, I have been.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Coppolino, are you going to be

    23           much longer? 

    24                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No, I'm not, your Honor.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I just want to know when counsel


                                                                            66

     1           would like a break.

     2                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I think if we went straight through

     3           we could be done in about 15 or 20 minutes.  If you wanted to

     4           break now, I could finish after the break.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, the panel wants to take a break

     6           now.

     7                    THE COURT CLERK:  All rise, please.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  We'll be back in 15 minutes.

     9                    (Court in recess; 10:49 to 11:07 o'clock a.m.)

    10                    THE COURT CLERK:  All rise, please.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Be seated, everyone.  Moving right

    12           along.

    13           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    14           Q   Mr. Burrington, does America Online have a Kids Only

    15           section?

    16           A   Yes, it does.

    17           Q   Could you describe it for the Court?

    18           A   We created a Kids Only section not real long ago, it's

    19           called the Kids Only Channel.  And we have separate producers

    20           for that and we basically have hand-picked content that we

    21           feel is appropriate for children from the year -- ages of 12

    22           and under based on work with parental groups that we deal

    23           with.  And we have a parental advisory panel that helps us

    24           recommend appropriate content and that content is drawn from

    25           some of our own content providers like Nickelodeon which has


                                                                            67

     1           tremendously great stuff for kids and other types of content

     2           within AOL.

     3                    And then we also have pre-selected a few Worldwide

     4           Websites that particularly contain educational or valuable

     5           material for children of that age.

     6           Q   I've opened your exhibit book to Exhibit 118 which is

     7           Defendants' Exhibit 118 which is a chapter from the America

     8           Online guide describing the Kids Only section.  Does Exhibit

     9           118 describe the types of information AOL makes available

    10           specifically for children?

    11           A   Yes, in a general sense, with one caveat that this book

    12           was published a while back and a number of changes have been

    13           made to that area, they're made frequently.

    14           Q   Paragraph 16 of your declaration, you state at the

    15           beginning that for parents who want to eliminate their

    16           children's risk of viewing objectionable material altogether,

    17           AOL has established an on-line area designed specifically for

    18           children.  Was there an incident recently where an individual

    19           E-mailed a sexually explicit image to subscribers who were in

    20           a Children Only chat room on America Online?

    21           A   Yes, as reported, I believe, in the Wall Street Journal

    22           and The Washington Post, there was an incident in which a AOL

    23           subscriber who we later found out was an adult was able to

    24           get screen names from chat room area, there's also a chat

    25           area for kids only that's heavily moderated by both parents


                                                                            68

     1           and AOL staff, but that person was able to essentially

     2           capture some of the screen names and then send those children

     3           private electronic mail messages with graphic files attached. 

     4           It's the --

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  How in the world did he do that?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Well, he did it by going into the chat

     7           area and just -- and writing down, we don't know exactly but

     8           writing down --

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  In the AOL chat area or the parent,

    10           the family chat area?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Right, within the Kids Only Channel

    12           there is a chat area and he was able to go in there and write

    13           down the screen names.  We had that reported to us

    14           immediately and it's important to know what we did with that

    15           information.  This is the first such incident we've ever had

    16           in the Kids Only Channel area, we immediately located that

    17           member and terminated his account.  And we're now cooperating

    18           with Federal law enforcement authorities on this issue.

    19                    And since that time, also, we've set up a new

    20           feature, and again, I don't mean to digress here, but I think

    21           it's important to note that we are trying very hard, since

    22           this is a medium in progress as we sit here today, to make

    23           enhancements and changes that we can as we become aware of

    24           problems.  That was not something that we had anticipated

    25           happening, but as soon as it did happen, we dealt with it


                                                                            69

     1           directly and swiftly and have since then bolstered the number

     2           of staff members that are in that area all day long and have

     3           also sent a special -- our CEO sent a special letter to all

     4           of our five million members to explain to them, and

     5           particularly parents, that there are going to be some

     6           potential risks sometimes, as there are in the physical

     7           world.  We can't create this absolutely perfect vacuum, and

     8           so there is some common sense required there.

     9                    For example, if your child gets an electronic mail

    10           message and there is a file attached to it and you don't know

    11           who it's from, we've made it very simple now at a click of a

    12           button to send that to our staff members who will actually

    13           open up that message, with the member's permission, and look

    14           at the graphic file for either a virus or, if it's

    15           inappropriate material, and they will not -- they won't send

    16           it back, if it is.  In other words, there's an easy mechanism

    17           now.

    18                    But a lot of this is common sense again which is

    19           trying to educate parents which we're doing in a variety of

    20           ways, the industry is and a number of other groups we're

    21           working with, to say, you know, just because you're in front

    22           of a computer screen doesn't mean that you, you know, throw

    23           common sense out the window and that there are a lot of

    24           parallels between the physical world and the cyberspace or

    25           electronic world.  You don't leave your child alone in a


                                                                            70

     1           shopping mall, you don't -- tell your child, oh, if somebody

     2           comes up to you, a stranger in the park, you don't tell them

     3           your phone number and your address.

     4                    So we try to drive home to parents that those same

     5           basic common sense types of things apply in the cyberspace

     6           world and that the responsibility is just as great as it

     7           would be in other media, whether it's a television or cable

     8           or what have you.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But it's your testimony that the CEO

    10           of America Online sent a letter to all five million

    11           subscribers about this incident?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct, Steve Case, our

    13           chairman and CEO, we sent out what are called community

    14           updates.  Again, this is not a corporate gimmick, it's part

    15           of our culture of both our members and the company, which is

    16           we sent out a special community update the day that that

    17           incident happened in which we explained what happened.  And

    18           that's our policy, is to be very up front and direct and to

    19           tell people what happened and how it happened and what we

    20           were doing about it and if they had any questions they could

    21           easily contact us and we'd provide them more information.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, it wasn't just being a nice

    23           guy, you have a powerful marketing interest to do that, don't

    24           you?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  We absolutely do.  I mean Steve is a


                                                                            71

     1           very nice guy but we really do have an interest in making

     2           sure parents, and particularly in this case, parents are

     3           comfortable that they are dealing with an entity and a medium

     4           that there is some control and that there are responsible

     5           people involved who are trying to make it better. 

     6                    so clearly it was designed to not panic people and

     7           also, frankly, to send a message that this sort of activity

     8           will not be tolerated on America Online.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  When he sent the letter was this an

    10           electronic letter?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  That, yes, your Honor, it was a little

    12           button you could -- when you signed on initially to AOL, and

    13           people read these, it's amazing the number of people who

    14           actually do read that. 

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I just wanted to know what kind of

    16           button.  Okay.

    17                    THE WITNESS:  Just a button.

    18           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    19           Q   Mr. Burrington, take a look at Exhibit 105, 105.  Is this

    20           the letter you were just referring to in response to the

    21           Court's questions from Mr. Case to America Online subscribers

    22           in connection with the incident you've just been testifying

    23           about?

    24           A   Yes, that is correct.

    25           Q   So it's Exhibit 105. 


                                                                            72

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Thank you, Mr. Coppolino.  And that

     2           was March 19, 1996, so that's pretty recent.

     3                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

     4           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

     5           Q   Mr. Burrington, just to finish the point on this subject,

     6           the fact that this is a kids only area does not mean that

     7           adults cannot enter it, is that correct?

     8           A   Yes, that's correct.  A number of parents do choose to

     9           accompany their children into that area.

    10           Q   Or any other adult or any other person, is that correct? 

    11           A   Or any -- that's correct.

    12           Q   And as you, I believe you indicated that you can obtain

    13           the screen names of the people who are in, for example, the

    14           children's only chat area because those are available on the

    15           screen, is that correct?

    16           A   In the event that a child -- partially correct.  In the

    17           event that a child is actually in a chat room, which not all

    18           children choose to chat with other children in that

    19           environment, someone could, I suppose, write down the screen

    20           names of people and some of those feed-ins may be in fact

    21           children, some could be adults, some could be parents.

    22           Q   To your knowledge have parents ever complaint to America

    23           Online about the nature of the chat that's going on in these

    24           children's only chat rooms?

    25           A   Other than this particular incident that we had, I'm not


                                                                            73

     1           aware of any major complaints.  I think that people have had

     2           questions and that's why we've set up a process where they

     3           can immediately get to a live human being to ask questions or

     4           lodge complaints, if there are some, if they see something

     5           that they think is inappropriate.

     6           Q   You're not aware of any other complaints by parents with

     7           respect to the chat in children's chat rooms?

     8           A   To my knowledge I'm not aware of any directly, no, I'm

     9           not.

    10           Q   Would you look at Paragraph 29, please?

    11           A   Of?

    12           Q   Your affidavit, I'm sorry, your declaration.  This is the

    13           last line of questioning.

    14                    In Paragraph 29 you testified all of the major on-

    15           line service providers are actively participating and

    16           facilitating the use of the so-called PICS standards, P-I-C-

    17           S, which stands for Platform for Internet Contents Selection,

    18           is that correct?

    19           A   That is correct.

    20           Q   Is America Online planning to incorporate a Webbrowser in

    21           its service that is compatible with a rating service such as

    22           PICS?

    23           A   Yes, we were, along with Prodigy and Compuserve and

    24           Microsoft, the founding members along with several other

    25           companies to encourage MIT to develop these standards.  So we


                                                                            74

     1           will, we have agreed by being part of this process to make

     2           sure that our service is compliant or with those technical

     3           standards that will be developed.

     4           Q   And would that be through your -- through a Webbrowser

     5           available on America Online?

     6           A   Yes.

     7           Q   And just for clarity sake, a Webbrowser is software

     8           through which a user can search the Worldwide Websites for

     9           information and graphical images, is that generally accurate?

    10           A   That's generally accurate, yes.

    11           Q   America Online already has a Webbrowser built in its

    12           software, built into its software, is that correct?

    13           A   That -- that's correct.

    14           Q   Is it also correct that America Online has recently

    15           entered into a licensing agreement with Microsoft which

    16           provides that the Microsoft Internet Explorer Webbrowser will

    17           be the standard browser built into America Online, is that

    18           correct?

    19           A   It will be the standard and you'll also have an option to

    20           use the Netscape browser as well.

    21           Q   Yeah, that's correct, in addition America Online has

    22           entered into a licensing agreement with Netscape which

    23           provides that the Netscape Navigator Webbrowser would also be

    24           available to AOL subscribers as part of your software?

    25           A   There will be an option to download that, yes.


                                                                            75

     1           Q   So that America Online subscribers would have a choice

     2           between these two browsers, is that correct?

     3           A   That's correct.

     4           Q   Is it also the case that Microsoft will incorporate the

     5           America Online software package into its Windows 95 software?



     6           A   That was part of the negotiated deal, yes.

     7           Q   When you testified a moment ago that America Online is

     8           developing software programs that would be compatible with

     9           rating standards such as PICS, would this include the

    10           Microsoft and Netscape Webbrowsers that we just talked about?

    11           A   Yes, it would because both of those companies are as

    12           committed as we are to this project.

    13           Q   Is it your understanding that this technology will be

    14           available by early summer, is that correct?

    15           A   That's my understanding, yes.

    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I have no further questions.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you very much, Mr. Coppolino.

    18                    Mr. Ennis?

    19                    MR. ENNIS:  Unless there are any questions from the

    20           Court, your Honor, I have no further questions on redirect.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, let the Court look at its

    22           notes which is the whole point of this.

    23                    (Pause.)

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Stewart, do you have a couple


                                                                            76

     1           questions?  I have a couple but you go ahead.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Hmm?

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do you have a couple questions?

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes.

     5                    Looking at Paragraph 7 of your declaration, Page 4. 

     6           Just out of curiosity, you say that the daily number of

     7           messages that's posted to AOL Bulletin Board is at between

     8           200,000 and 250,000 daily.  How do you get that number?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  Well, we've actually, I was just

    10           informed this morning by my assistant who is here, we have

    11           now like ten -- I think I had said earlier there might be 800

    12           or over a thousand message boards and I was told that we've

    13           hit an all time record of something like 15,000.  And so we

    14           are able to track in a sort of just an aggregate way the

    15           amount of volume that's occurring on our boards or in our

    16           chat rooms or amount of the, the sort of aggregate data on,

    17           you know, how many E-mail messages were sent today or how

    18           many people actually were logged into a chat room at some

    19           point during the day or how many specific message board

    20           postings there were or categories of those postings.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  This is within, to use your analogy,

    22           the AOL swimming pool?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, exactly.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Can you make these counts more -- we

    25           heard testimony last -- the first two days here that it's


                                                                            77

     1           very difficult to count hits, as they're called.  Are you

     2           more accurate within your swimming pool than outside in the

     3           ocean?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  I think if you're talking again that

     5           this is a functional sort of analysis, if you're talking

     6           about electronic mail that is sent or received within AOL or

     7           the message boards, as I said, that is more accurate.  It's

     8           still not precisely accurate, but when you get out into the

     9           Internet and you start talking about the number of people

    10           who've actually clicked on a particular Website, it's much

    11           less accurate information.

    12                    And in fact the industry, and I chair a group within

    13           the industry that -- of all the major on-line Internet

    14           companies.  One of the things we're looking at is developing

    15           more accurate data as to, you know, some more accurate

    16           measure because as this business model continues to evolve,

    17           clearly the great promise is that there will be more commerce

    18           on the Internet.  And we need to come up with sort of the

    19           like Albitron or the -- I forget the television -- Nielsen

    20           rating systems, a way to more accurately measure how many

    21           people are actually in an area or visit an area each day.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I'd like to just flesh out, and then

    23           I'll be done, an area that we got into in some detail with

    24           Mr. Bradner.  I don't know if you've read the testimony or

    25           not.


                                                                            78

     1                    THE WITNESS:  No, I have not directly, no, your

     2           Honor.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But we were talking about caching,

     4           and for the record since I noticed in glancing at the

     5           transcript that it was consistently misspelled C-A-S-H-I-N-G,

     6           we're not talking about -- 

     7                    (Laughter.)

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  We're not talking about ATM

     9           machines, we're talking about the Internet and it's C-A-C-H-

    10           I-N-G.

    11                    Does AOL do caching for its subscribers?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  We do cache on our AOL servers

    13           and also members who download, for example, if you're out on

    14           the Worldwide Web and you access a Webpage the very first

    15           time, it's going to take a while, and that information is

    16           downloaded onto your hard drive or it's cached.  And there's

    17           actually an area where you can go and purge your cache every

    18           now and then to get rid of, you know.  But for example, if I

    19           go on today and get into a Webpage and I come back two hours

    20           later, it's quicker if most of that information is residing

    21           already on my computer.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But if I were accessing, say, the

    23           British Library through AOL and obviously that site is in

    24           London, it -- would AOL cache the British Library card

    25           catalogue for a finite period of time so that the next time I


                                                                            79

     1           dial in, say an hour later, it's not a long-distance call for

     2           you guys, not for me?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  I mean, that's accurate, we do

     4           cache those kinds of sites just again to cut down on cost, to

     5           make it more convenient for our members.  Worldwide

     6           universally everybody does that, so that's how the system

     7           kind of works.  It's no formal convention, it's just that out

     8           of practice everybody does that that has a server.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's in your commercial interest to

    10           do that, is it not?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because it lowers your cost?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  It lowers both our costs and our

    14           members, it increases their patience level, shall we say, and

    15           makes them less impatient because they don't have to wait so

    16           long.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because the second time they get it

    18           faster?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Right, exactly.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  That's all I have.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Judge Buckwalter?

    22                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yes, I do.  

    23                    Mr. Burrington, just a housekeeping matter, did you

    24           graduate from St. Lawrence University?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  No, I actually --


                                                                            80

     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Oh, is that Lawrence, is that

     2           correct, Lawrence?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Lawrence in Appleton, Wisconsin,

     4           right.

     5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Oh, I didn't know there was a

     6           Lawrence University.

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, there is.

     8                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I'm glad I asked that question,

     9           okay.  For your alma mater's -- 

    10                    THE WITNESS:  And I did graduate.

    11                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- for your alma mater's sake,

    12           okay.  The thrust of your testimony, I gather, is that you

    13           are continuing to make efforts to in some way edit the

    14           content of what goes on your service in some way and you're

    15           making an effort to see that it's not available, some of it,

    16           to people under 18.  Is that correct?

    17                    THE WITNESS:  That's -- it's a reasonable statement,

    18           your Honor.  I think that what we're doing, to clarify a

    19           little bit, is that on those areas, like I said, where we

    20           have contracts with third parties, for example, or special

    21           areas like the Kids Only area, we can be a little bit more

    22           proactive on the reality as given the sheer volume, you know,

    23           five million members, hundreds of thousands of postings,

    24           people coming in and out from the Internet, so on and so

    25           forth, we simply operate, I think -- and I have to use this


                                                                            81

     1           analogy like any, picture any major city of five million

     2           people, there are bound to be some bad actors.

     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Right.

     4                    THE WITNESS:  We have a police force, so to speak,

     5           but they can't be everywhere at a time, so we rely on a

     6           system of our members complaining to us which works very well

     7           and then we're on top of it and we deal with it.

     8                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Now, even prior to CDA, which is

     9           the act, you were concerned about I think you had a program

    10           whereby the applicant had to certify he or she was over 18. 

    11           This was way before the CDA was ever thought of that you had

    12           this provision, is that correct?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.  And really all the

    14           on-line services, the commercial ones and many pure Internet

    15           access providers well before, I mean our parental controls,

    16           Prodigy's, Compuserve's have been out there and in

    17           development in one stage or another for actually several

    18           years, way before this became a sexy topic on Capitol Hill,

    19           so to speak.  And I think the reality is we've been using

    20           those tools and refining them and all of the services, as far

    21           as I know, have always required that you have to be 18 years

    22           of age or older to sign up.  And that makes sense for a

    23           number of reasons because somebody's got to pay the bill,

    24           somebody's got to be responsible for the charges on the

    25           credit card or the checking account debit.


                                                                            82

     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Is it your opinion, Mr.

     2           Burrington, that the industry can't come up with an effective

     3           way, I mean America Online can't come up with an effective

     4           way of preventing certain access, preventing access to minors

     5           of certain material and that indeed it has to come through

     6           the parents?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Right.  I mean this whole debate --

     8                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Despite PICS and all these other

     9           advancements, is that your opinion?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Our opinion, I think, is at least from

    11           America Online's perspective, and I do believe I can speak

    12           for my colleagues, is that we are trying to find a package of

    13           tools that work, give them to parents, give them the

    14           education they need to use them.  Remind parents that this

    15           is, just because it's cyberspace it's not any different than

    16           the physical world and your children may run into things that

    17           are inappropriate.  And we will give you the tools and we'll

    18           make them simple, we'll make them cheap, but ultimately the

    19           most effective way to deal with this issue is for the parents

    20           to take that responsibility and we will help them, as we have

    21           been.

    22                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  And you're a lawyer as well, do

    23           you think you are complying with the good faith defenses of

    24           the-- that the act sets forth?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  Well, right now, your -- I'm sorry?


                                                                            83

     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  You think you're complying with

     2           the good faith defenses that the act sets forth in the manner

     3           in which you're approaching this?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  That's a very good question, you know,

     5           there is so much that's not clear about this act and not

     6           clear about some of the definitions.  We have met internally,

     7           I and some of my colleagues, to say what are the legal

     8           liabilities here, what can we do to try to comply with this

     9           particular law if it was upheld, and frankly, we're not sure,

    10           we don't know.

    11                    And, more importantly, our five million members, I

    12           don't think know either because they don't have 20 lawyers in

    13           house to advise them.

    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay, I don't want to ask -- take

    15           any more time.  Thank you, sir.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  In your Rules of the Road that you

    17           were referring to before, you said you reserved the right to

    18           remove content.  Now, leaving aside the surveillance that you

    19           do of the Kids Only or the Kids Network material, what do you

    20           do other than respond to complaints with respect to -- to

    21           effectuate that right that you have reserved to yourselves?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  If your Honor -- your Honor, if you'll

    23           permit me about a minute, let me try to, because there are a

    24           couple of different avenues here.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And how many people does it take


                                                                            84

     1           and how much money does it take?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  A lot and a lot. 

     3                    (Laughter.)

     4                    THE WITNESS:  To be honest with you, but what we do

     5           is in a couple of ways, your Honors, we -- let's look at

     6           private electronic mail.  And I'm sure -- I haven't  read the

     7           record, but I'm sure the Electronic Communications Privacy

     8           Act may have been raised here which is, you know, we cannot

     9           look at private E-mail, it's against Federal law, so we don't

    10           know what people are doing amongst themselves, just as with

    11           regular mail.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It's against Federal law?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  It's against Federal law under the

    14           Electronic Communications Privacy Act for our company or for

    15           anybody to go in and look into somebody's mailbox just like

    16           it would be at the end of your -- at your mailbox at your

    17           home unless we receive a court order or a subpoena to do so. 

    18           And we have in fact in some cooperative efforts with the

    19           Justice Department have cooperated in those cases.

    20                    Then when you look at the Message Boards, we have

    21           talked about chat rooms, the three different kind AOL,

    22           member, private.  On the AOL rooms and on the member rooms we

    23           have staff 24 hours a day, seven days a week who sit there in

    24           front of a screen and scroll through these names of rooms and

    25           if there's something that looks, you know, on its face that


                                                                            85

     1           would be, you know, free Microsoft Windows here or child

     2           pornography here, if there's such a room we will -- we delete

     3           the room, a name, we basically destroy the room and the

     4           members are thrown back into the lobby.

     5                    If it's really clear or we get a complaint sometimes

     6           in the process of Live Chat somebody can, it's sort of like

     7           an electronic 911, somebody can send us a message and we'll

     8           go in and look.  And if we think it's clearly -- and it's

     9           hard for these people to make these judgments, but if it's so

    10           clear on its face that it's, for example, illegal child

    11           pornography, we will then capture that data, we will record

    12           the name of the members and we will terminate them and turn

    13           that information over to Federal authorities.

    14                    Then in the content area that I think, you know, the

    15           vast majority of AOL content again within cooperation with

    16           our information providers together we say, you know, just to

    17           give you an information provider doesn't mean you have no

    18           rules.  They have to also abide by our terms of service and

    19           we put the burden on them as well to make sure that the kind

    20           of content that they're putting up is not violative of those

    21           terms.

    22                    But, so it's really a combination, in some areas

    23           where it's practical both economically and in terms of

    24           staffing to sort of -- and I hate to use this term because we

    25           don't look at it this way -- but sort of to hire a police


                                                                            86

     1           force, if you will, in parts of our community where we know

     2           there's going to be potential problems, we can and we do do

     3           that, to an extent.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  How many people, this is an area

     5           that you have some expertise in, how many people does it take

     6           to do the kind of surveillance that you have currently

     7           undertaken?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Well, the sort of -- I wouldn't like

     9           to use the term "surveillance," your Honor, but just in terms

    10           of the --

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I don't know what else it is,

    12           but...

    13                    THE WITNESS:  The patrolling, maybe, in terms of

    14           the, because the surveillance, our members are kind of

    15           sensitive to that.  And I think that what we do, your Honor,

    16           as far as I know our Terms of Service Department I think has

    17           added a number of people, I am estimating here totally but

    18           around 50 to 60 people full time who are there to not just

    19           patrol but to respond to complaints.

    20                    And I don't know, I've never looked, it would be

    21           interesting to see out of how many cities of five million

    22           people, you know how many police officers there are in a city

    23           of five million people, but we don't have anywhere near that

    24           because it's just -- it's impossible.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Some of this case obviously hinges


                                                                            87

     1           on technical matters which at least this member of the panel

     2           is less familiar with than you and maybe the other members,

     3           and I just want to see if I can get down to the nub of the

     4           difference set forth mostly in Paragraphs 26 through 28 of

     5           your declarations between being on a services server computer

     6           or on Cyber Patrol?  Am I correct that there's a technical,

     7           that there are two ways to do this and that America Online

     8           and Prodigy -- well, America Online and Microsoft Network

     9           represent one way and Prodigy and Compuserve represent the

    10           other?  Is that correct?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  That's -- that's almost an accurate

    12           statement, let me maybe clarify it.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I want to know what the difference

    14           is, if you can do it sort of in terms that --

    15                    THE WITNESS:  Quickly?

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, and terms that we can

    17           understand.

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Okay, let me try and do that.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And the effect for this case, I

    20           mean, not -- you know.

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Let me do it by way of example just

    22           with AOL and this would be true also for our colleagues or

    23           competitors.

    24                    We have our Parental Control Tools we talked about

    25           here.  Those reside on our, they're part of our service, it's


                                                                            88

     1           part of the thing that you get when you get your disk, it's

     2           already in the system but it resides, as does all of this, on

     3           a host computer back in Reston, Virginia, where all of our

     4           computers are located.  

     5                    So the member just has that, just like they can

     6           access New York Times, they can access Parental Controls.

     7                    Now, let's say we were to offer Cyber Patrol or

     8           Surfwatch.  There are two ways we can do that.  We can either

     9           make it just like --

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's the other way?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  That's -- that's, well --

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's the alternate, is that the

    13           alternate?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  It's the alternate but it's -- it's

    15           really, it's an enhancement, it's not an either/or, they're

    16           really a package.  And what I mean by that is if you notice

    17           as we walk through AOL's Parental Controls which are very

    18           similar to the other services, they really address most

    19           squarely the kind of content we provide.  Like, I mean it

    20           addresses that closed swimming pool, mostly.  Those are the

    21           lifeguards, if you will, and to some extent it encompasses a

    22           little bit of the Internet when we say we can block binary

    23           downloads or you can block access to all news groups.

    24                    What Surfwatch or Cyber Patrol do is it's an added

    25           feature to allow you to block access to specific Websites and


                                                                            89

     1           to other places on the Internet. So when you put them

     2           together, you sort of have this in effect, the attempt is

     3           sort of full coverage to cover the pool as well as the ocean.

     4                    Now, that's sort of the distinction.  When Prodigy

     5           announced or Compuserve announced what they're doing, I

     6           suspect what they're doing is packaging within their existing

     7           Parental Controls they did a license, you know, with Cyber

     8           Patrol and they're going to package that same stuff in

     9           together.  The reason it's taken us a little bit longer is

    10           we're trying to find a way to make it so seamless and

    11           transparent that the member never knows.  They get the

    12           benefits of Cyber Patrol but it's going to be the same

    13           interface, it's going to all look the same as it does now

    14           with Parental Control.  And that means that that software

    15           will actually reside on our computers in Reston, we're not

    16           going to send a disk out to every single member.  It will sit

    17           on our computers and they'll access it just like our regular

    18           Parental Controls.

    19                    And there's -- there are two important reasons for

    20           keeping it in our -- on our host server: one is, frankly, a

    21           marketing and an ease of use, the kind of research we've done

    22           internally both with our own people and with consultants is

    23           that parents don't want to have to switch into this and then

    24           switch into that and have to load things and get -- it gets

    25           all complicated. 


                                                                            90

     1                    We want them to be familiar with what they've

     2           already been working with which is Parental Controls and the

     3           other reason is a security reason, which is it's a lot harder

     4           for people to disable or to, you know, try to shut off

     5           something like the Cyber Patrol or for hackers and that kind

     6           of thing.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  You say or said that PICS

     8           will increase the ease and effectiveness of user-based

     9           parental control of minors' on-line access.  I may have

    10           gotten it wrong because I was trying to take it -- I can't

    11           write so I was typing, I was trying to take it down.  How, I

    12           mean does PICS do anything, do PICS do something technical or

    13           does it just rate?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  PICS is a -- is a --

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But I think, you know, a short

    16           answer, please.

    17                    THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  It's hard on this one though,

    18           your Honor, these are -- these are very complicated.  I think

    19           that --

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, if the parties are going to

    21           have some more about PICS then I don't think  I have to ask

    22           you, but...

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Do you know?

    24                    MR. COPPOLINO:  We are, your Honor.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, well, then we'll -- an


                                                                            91

     1           expert, Mr. --

     2                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, plaintiffs' expert, plaintiffs

     3           have a witness, Mr. Basa (ph.) from MIT, I believe, who is an

     4           expert in PICS.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I'm not asking for him to testify. 

     6           I just don't want to ask duplicative questions.

     7                    MR. MORRIS:  Plaintiffs' expert Albert Zosa who is

     8           one of the people involved in the creation of PICS at MIT

     9           will be testifying on behalf of plaintiffs.  The Government

    10           has agreed to allow him, because of the schedule, to testify

    11           during the Government's trial days.

    12                    THE COURT:  Oh, okay.  Then I won't -- then I'm

    13           finished with questions.

    14                    And have my questions elicited any or any of the

    15           Courts' questions elicited any questions from the --

    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Just a couple, if I may, your Honor.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Sure.  

    18                             FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION

    19           BY MR. COPPOLINO:  

    20           Q   Mr. Burrington, Judge Dalzell asked you a couple of

    21           questions about caching and in your response were you

    22           referring to the caching of information that was available on

    23           Worldwide Websites or were you referring to information

    24           available through AOL's own on-line content or both?

    25           A   I was -- I think the question to me was -- was phrased as


                                                                            92

     1           the Internet or Worldwide Websites, I believe, and that's

     2           what I was referring to.

     3           Q   Okay.  And that information is cached on AOL's servers

     4           for the convenience of your subscribers?

     5           A   That is correct.

     6           Q   How man -- I believe you testified in your declaration

     7           that AOL has 4,000 employees, is that correct?

     8           A   Today, at the rate we're going, it could be 4500 as of

     9           today.

    10           Q   You used the term "police force" a couple of times in

    11           response to questions from the panel.  Were you referring to

    12           your Terms of Service advisors?

    13           A   Our Terms of Service staff, yes.

    14           Q   Do you know approximately how many Terms of Service staff

    15           advisors you have?

    16           A   I think I testified, and it's a very much of a rough

    17           estimate because I haven't -- it changes rapidly, is about

    18           60, I thought, full time.

    19           Q   And could you just indicate what types of services they

    20           monitor, do they monitor chat areas, for instance?

    21           A   Yeah, mostly they monitor the chat rooms, certainly the

    22           member-created rooms as well as the AOL room.  They are

    23           available in the Kids Only area, anywhere where there's more

    24           likely to be questions.  And there is a, you know, they're

    25           universal, if you will, Cyber 911 capabilities on AOL which

<H2>Testimony of Stephen Donaldson -- president, Stop Prisoner Rape</H2>
<STRONG>April 1, 1996</STRONG> 
<PRE>

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Next witness.

    21                    MS. HEINS:  Good morning, your Honors.  I'm Marjorie

    22           Heins, one of the attorneys representing the ACLU plaintiffs

    23           and our next witness is Stephen Donaldson.  He's the

    24           president of Stop Prisoner Rape.

    25                    (Pause.)

                                                                            94

     1                    MS. HEINS:  Mr. Donaldson's direct testimony

     2           declaration was signed on March 17th and filed with the Court

     3           on March 28th and at this point I would move it into

     4           evidence.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do you have any objection?

     6                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No objections, your Honor.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, it's accepted, received.

     8                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, if I may introduce to

     9           the Court my colleague, Mary Kustel, who will be handling the

    10           cross-examination of this witness.  Thank you.

    11                    THE COURT CLERK:  Mr. Donaldson, would you please

    12           stand and raise your right hand?

    13                    STEPHEN DONALDSON, Plaintiffs' Witness, Sworn.

    14                    THE COURT CLERK:  Thank you, please be seated. 

    15           State and spell your name.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Stephen Donaldson, S-t-e-p-h-e-n 

    17           D-o-n-a-l-d-s-o-n.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Proceed.

    19                    MS. KUSTEL:  Good afternoon, your Honors.

    20                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

    21           BY MS. KUSTEL:  

    22           Q   Good afternoon, Mr. Donaldson.  You are the president of

    23           Stop Prisoner Rape, correct?

    24           A   That is correct.

    25           Q   And Stop Prisoner Rape is a non-profit organization
                                                                            95

     1           committed to combating prison rape, is that correct?

     2           A   That is correct.

     3           Q   It also is committed to providing assistance to the

     4           victims of prisoner rape, correct?

     5           A   Yes.

     6           Q   You are concerned that Stop Prisoner Rape might be

     7           prosecuted under the Communications Decency Act for material

     8           that it posts on its web site, correct?

     9           A   Yes.

    10           Q   Stop Prisoner Rape posts material on its Website that

    11           discusses prisoner rape, correct?

    12           A   Yes.

    13           Q   And it often discusses that topic in graphic detail,

    14           correct?

    15           A   We include on our site discussion in graphic detail, not

    16           necessarily originated by us but often by prisoners, former

    17           prisoners.

    18           Q   But there is material on your site that is discussing

    19           prisoner rape in graphic detail, correct?

    20           A   Yes.

    21           Q   And would you also describe some of the language in the

    22           material on your site as street language?

    23           A   Yes, yes.  Prisoners in particular are not educated in

    24           Latin and tend to use Anglo-Saxon English.

    25           Q   One of the purposes of Stop Prisoner Rape's Website is to
                                                                            96

     1           educate the public about the phenomenon of prisoner rape, is

     2           that right?

     3           A   That's correct.

     4           Q   And among the things that the Website does is to provide

     5           data about prisoner rape, is that correct?

     6           A   That's correct.

     7           Q   And it also provides a forum for the victims of prisoner

     8           rape to discuss their recollections and experiences, correct?

     9           A   Yes.

    10           Q   And it also provides information about the spreading of

    11           AIDS as a result of prison rape, is that correct?

    12           A   Yes, and prevention of the spreading of AIDS.

    13           Q   For example, could you please turn to Exhibit Number 145

    14           in the Defendants' Exhibits Volume 3?

    15           A   I'm not sure which of these volumes Defendant's...

    16                    MS. KUSTEL:  May I approach the witness to help him?

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, you may.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Sure.

    19                    THE WITNESS:  143?

    20           BY MS. KUSTEL:  

    21           Q   145.

    22           A   145?

    23           Q   Yes, 145.

    24           A   Yes.

    25           Q   Do you recognize this as the hard copy of some material
                                                                            97

     1           that appears on the Stop Prisoner Rape Website?

     2           A   AIDS advice for the prisoner rape survivor, right.

     3           Q   And you recognize it as something that appears on the

     4           Website, correct?

     5           A   That is correct.

     6           Q   You're concerned that Stop Prisoner Rape might be

     7           prosecuted under the Act for posting this on its Website,

     8           correct?

     9           A   Yes.

    10           Q   And Stop Prisoner Rape's purpose in posting this material

    11           on its Website is to give practical advice to potential

    12           prisoner rape victims, correct?

    13           A   That is part of the purpose.  Another part of the purpose

    14           is to educate professionals who must deal with these issues

    15           as to what the reality of the situation is and for that

    16           purpose we have in effect given them a copy of the advice

    17           that we give to prisoners directly.

    18           Q   So, the purpose, Stop Prisoner Rape's purpose is both to

    19           give advice to potential victims and to educate professionals

    20           and other people?

    21           A   Right, also to provide support for those who have already

    22           become victims.

    23           Q   Would you characterize the material in this exhibit as

    24           using street language?

    25           A   Yes, I counted 11 instances of language that might be
                                                                            98

     1           considered objectionable by some people.

     2           Q   And you would characterize it as street language?

     3           A   Yes; Anglo-Saxon English, in other words.

     4           Q   Stop Prisoner Rape's purpose in using street language in

     5           this exhibit is to educate people who might not otherwise

     6           understand other language, is that correct?

     7           A   Yes.  Since the document concerned was written for

     8           prisoners we have had to write it in language that even

     9           uneducated prisoners, some of whom can even barely read,

    10           would understand.

    11           Q   Does Stop Prisoner Rape also post statistics concerning

    12           prisoner rape on its Website?

    13           A   Yes, we have a statistical report now in its seventh

    14           edition.

    15           Q   Could you please turn to Exhibit 138?  Is this one of the

    16           statistical reports that Stop Prisoner Rape posts on its

    17           Website?

    18           A   Correct, it's called "Rape of Incarcerated Americans, a

    19           Preliminary Statistical Look." 

    20           Q   Thank you.  Could you please turn also to Exhibit 143? 

    21           Do you recognize this as material that is posted on the Stop

    22           Prisoner Rape's Website as well?

    23           A   Yes, this is the program statement on sexual assault

    24           prevention intervention programs by the Federal Bureau of

    25           Prisons.
                                                                            99

     1           Q   Stop Prisoner Rape has a person its board of directors

     2           that's responsible for maintaining the Website, correct?

     3           A   That is correct.

     4           Q   That person is Ellen Spertus?

     5           A   Ellen Spertus, and her title is Webmaster.

     6           Q   Ms. Spertus is a doctoral candidate in computer science

     7           at MIT, correct?

     8           A   That is correct.

     9           Q   Would you agree that she's very knowledgeable about

    10           computers?

    11           A   Yes, I would.

    12           Q   Do you know if Ms. Spertus knows HTML or hypertext mark-

    13           up language?

    14           A   She does.

    15                    MS. KUSTEL:  Your Honors, may I have a moment to

    16           confer with counsel?

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes.

    18                    (Pause.)

    19                    MS. KUSTEL:  Thank you, Mr. Donaldson.  I have no

    20           further questions.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  

    22                    MS. HEINS:  Nothing -- no redirect at this time.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  Does the Court...

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No.

    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I don't believe I do, thank you.
                                                                           100

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, I don't.  Thank you very

     2           much.

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Thank you very much.

     4                    (Witness excused.)

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The next witness?

     6                    (Pause.)

     7                    MS. KAPPLER:  Thank you, your Honors.  Ann Kappler

     8           for the ALA plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs next call Andrew L.

     9           Anker, who is president and CEO of Hotwired Adventures, LLC,

    10           one of the plaintiffs in this action.

    11                    THE COURT CLERK:  Would you please raise your right

    12           hand?

    13                    ANDREW L. ANKER, Plaintiffs' Witness, Sworn.

    14                    THE COURT CLERK:  Thank you, please be seated. 

    15           Please state and spell your name.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Andrew L. Anker, A-n-k-e-r.

    17                    MS. KAPPLER:  At this time, your Honors, plaintiffs

    18           move into evidence the declaration of Andrew L. Anker as his

    19           direct trial testimony, the declaration was executed on the

    20           26th of March and submitted to this Court on the 28th of

    21           March.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  Does the Government

    23           have any objection?

    24                    MR. COPPOLINO:  We have no objection, your Honor. 

    25           Mr. Anker's cross-examination will be handled by my

                                                                           101

     1           colleague, Craig Blackwell, Judge Dalzell signed his pro hac

     2           vice petition this morning.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's fine, thank you.  Nice to

     4           get a chance to see you all, hear you all.

     5                    MR. BLACKWELL:  Good morning, your Honors.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Good morning.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, it's afternoon.

     8                    (Laughter.)

     9                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

    10           BY MR. BLACKWELL:  

    11           Q   Good afternoon, Mr. Anker.

    12           A   Good afternoon, Mr. Blackwell.

    13           Q   What is your position at Hotwired?

    14           A   I am president and CEO.

    15           Q   And you described Hotwired in your affidavit as an on-

    16           line news and entertainment service, correct?

    17           A   Yes.

    18           Q   Could you turn to Government's Exhibit 122 in the binder

    19           in front of you?

    20                    (Pause.)

    21           Q   This is Hotwired's home page on the Web, correct?

    22           A   Yes.

    23           Q   And the content on Hotwired's site is grouped in terms of

    24           topics into the -- into seven subject matters that are listed

    25           on this page, correct?

                                                                           102

     1           A   Right now it is, yes; that changes on a regular basis,

     2           but at this point, correct.

     3           Q   This is the current?

     4           A   Yes.

     5           Q   Directing your attention to the exhibit, I want to go

     6           briefly over the seven topic areas.  There's Worldbeat,

     7           right?

     8           A   Correct.

     9           Q   And that's information relating to travel?

    10           A   Correct.

    11           Q   There's Signal --

    12           A   Correct.

    13           Q   -- which is news and news and commentary section?

    14           A   Correct.

    15           Q   Which is information about things like Wall Street...

    16           A   Politics, the Net, that kind of thing.

    17           Q   There's Renaissance, correct?

    18           A   Yes.

    19           Q   Which is information about arts and entertainment?

    20           A   Right.

    21           Q   And that includes things like reviews and coverage of

    22           arts events?

    23           A   It includes that, yes.

    24           Q   Then there's Cocktail --

    25           A   Right.

                                                                           103

     1           Q   -- which is information about how to make different types

     2           of drinks?

     3           A   Again, among other things, yes.

     4           Q   Then there's Piazza --

     5           A   Right.

     6           Q   -- which has on-line chat and thread discussions relating

     7           generally to the other topics on Hotwired's site, correct?

     8           A   It relates to that and to some larger discussions that

     9           don't necessarily have to pertain to Hotwired's specific

    10           content.

    11           Q   About political issues...

    12           A   Broad-based issues that concern our community.

    13           Q   Political issues?

    14           A   That would certainly be one.

    15           Q   Social issues?

    16           A   Correct.

    17           Q   Just for the record, a thread discussion is a form of

    18           asynchronous communication postings by users, correct?

    19           A   Right.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That wasn't in my dictionary when I

    21           read it last night --

    22                    (Laughter.)

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- and I didn't have a chance to

    24           look at the big one, is somebody going to tell us what that

    25           is?  Do you know?

                                                                           104

     1                    THE WITNESS:  May I?  Yes, sure.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Judge Dalzell probably knows.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Not at the same time.

     4                    THE WITNESS:  The distinction is made asynchronous

     5           versus real-time.  Asynchronous is not in real time, so

     6           asynchronous discussion is where I may go and post and then

     7           it remains on the discussion board, equivalent to what

     8           American Online has, then someone else at another time will

     9           come and see that.  The distinction is real-time chat, which

    10           is -- it's actually happening there, I'll type something, if

    11           you're in the room you'll see it and if you came to the room

    12           five minutes later you wouldn't actually see it.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you both for elucidating.

    14           BY MR. BLACKWELL:  

    15           Q   And Hotwired includes both sites that you have described?

    16           A   Correct.

    17           Q   And, finally, there's Wired Magazine, which is the on-

    18           line version of Wired Magazine, correct?

    19           A   Yes, I think you skipped Netizen (ph.), which is our

    20           election and politics coverage, but that's correct.

    21           Q   There's Netizen and then the final category is Wired?

    22           A   Correct.

    23           Q   And Wired is a nationally-distributed magazine, correct?

    24           A   Yes.

    25           Q   With a circulation of over 300,000?

                                                                           105

     1           A   Yes.

     2           Q   Mr. Anker, I'd like you to direct your attention to

     3           Defendant's Exhibit 125, which is in the same notebook in

     4           front of you, do you see it there?

     5           A   Yes.

     6           Q   Did this appear in the Renaissance program section that

     7           we just described?

     8           A   Right.  We call them channels, but, yes, it was a piece

     9           of the Renaissance channel.

    10           Q   And this is a feature Hotwired ran on two artists,

    11           correct?

    12           A   Correct, Allen Ginsberg and Francesco Clemente.

    13           Q   And Ginsberg is a poet?

    14           A   Yes.

    15           Q   And Clemente is a painter?

    16           A   Correct.

    17           Q   And this feature combines original paintings by Clemente

    18           with original text by Ginsberg, correct?

    19           A   Correct.  I don't think either one of them was actually

    20           created specifically for Hotwired, but these have been around

    21           for a while.

    22           Q   These are their original works of art?

    23           A   Correct.

    24           Q   And you are concerned, sir, that Defendants' Exhibit 125

    25           may be covered by the Communications Decency Act, correct?

                                                                           106

     1           A   Given that I don't understand what patently offensive or

     2           indecent means, and I don't understand under which

     3           communities they may be prosecuted, it's fair to say that I

     4           am concerned by this exhibited.

     5           Q   And you are concerned that all of the Ginsberg poems in

     6           the exhibit may be covered, correct?

     7           A   Yeah, I think -- I have degrees of concern about each

     8           one.  I mean, there are certainly some that I think it would

     9           be safe to say I am more concerned by, given specific pieces

    10           of content but, again, given the unclear nature of the

    11           language in the CDA it's safe to say I'm concerned about

    12           everything.

    13           Q   Are you also concerned about all of the Clemente pictures

    14           that are referenced here too, correct?

    15           A   Correct.

    16           Q   Now, Hotwired has never to your knowledge posted or

    17           otherwise included in its on-line offerings sexually explicit

    18           pictures, has it?

    19           A   How would you define sexually explicit?

    20           Q   Let's take as an example a centerfold from Penthouse

    21           magazine.

    22           A   Not to my knowledge -- not to my knowledge would we ever

    23           do certainly a centerfold from Penthouse magazine, it would

    24           be a copyright violation, but if you're asking is that the

    25           type of content that generally appears on Hotwired, no.

                                                                           107

     1           Q   To your knowledge it's never appeared, correct?

     2           A   To my knowledge, no.

     3           Q   And to your knowledge Hotwired has never posted or

     4           included in its on-line offerings pictures of couples engaged

     5           in sexual activity, has it?

     6           A   Again, I think in this exhibit there is an example that

     7           might be construed as that.

     8           Q   Which page of the exhibit are you pointing to?

     9                    (Pause.)

    10           Q   Is it the second page from the end?

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  "Labyrinth," is it "Labyrinth"?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, the "Labyrinth" page.  It's hard

    13           obviously with this photocopy that I have, but I think it's

    14           safe to say that that is -- that pictures two people engaged

    15           in a sexual act.

    16           BY MR. BLACKWELL:  

    17           Q   Now, in addition to the "Labyrinth" painting by Clemente

    18           you are not aware, are you, of any other posting in

    19           Hotwired's on-line offerings of couples engaged in sexual

    20           activity, are you?

    21           A   I am not personally aware.

    22           Q   And also, Mr. Anker, Hotwired has never to your knowledge

    23           posted or otherwise included in its offerings pictures of

    24           excretory activities, has it?

    25           A   Not to my knowledge.

                                                                           108

     1           Q   You took a one-year computer programming course in high

     2           school, Mr. Anker?

     3           A   That's correct.

     4           Q   And that's the extent of your formal training in computer

     5           programming?

     6           A   Yes.

     7           Q   Other than that you're self-taught?

     8           A   Yes.

     9           Q   You're familiar with hypertext markup language, aren't

    10           you?

    11           A   Yes.

    12           Q   HTML?

    13           A   Right.

    14           Q   And you have used it to create your own personal Web

    15           page, correct?

    16           A   That's correct.

    17           Q   And it took you approximately an hour or two to create

    18           your own Web page and get it up and running?

    19           A   Right.  As I think as I said in my deposition, that was

    20           the initial amount of time; a good Website is constantly

    21           being worked on, but in terms of the initial amount of time

    22           to get it put up, yes, that's about right.

    23           Q   Thank you, Mr. Anker.

    24                    MR. BLACKWELL:  Your Honors, no further questions at

    25           this point.

                                                                           109

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Ms. Kappler?

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Any redirect?

     4                    MS. KAPPLER:  Your Honor, we have no redirect

     5           questions, unless the Court has questions which might prompt

     6           them.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, Judge Buckwalter has

     8           questions.

     9                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, I don't.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, no, you don't?

    11                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, I don't.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  Judge Dalzell?

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  In Paragraph 17 of your declaration

    14           you talk about the Hotwired's current registration system,

    15           and you said that -- I think it's in Paragraph 17, that as

    16           far as the password issue is concerned that some people have

    17           resigned, is that true?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  There are definitely people who will

    19           not come to our site because of the password issue.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And how do you know that?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  We actually -- as of I believe it's

    22           last August I have made it optional.  So, you can either come

    23           in and get certain additional features if you choose to

    24           subscribe using a password or you can visit our content

    25           without, and the numbers that we see are approximately five

                                                                           110

     1           times as many people come in without entering their password.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What's that?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  About five times as many people on a

     4           daily basis that visit our site don't enter the password,

     5           even though we do give them a number of features to help them

     6           actually go through our site better, they would still rather

     7           not enter their password.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, that's the only one I

     9           have.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I might have one, let me just

    11           double check.

    12                    (Pause.)

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think you answered the

    14           Government's questions by saying you couldn't think of -- I

    15           guess the purport of your answers was you couldn't think of

    16           anything, was it that you couldn't think of anything that

    17           Wired communicates that might fall within this statute, was

    18           that your answer?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  I don't believe so.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Because you talked in Paragraph 8

    21           of something called -- a news group called Alt. Sex Bondage. 

    22           I'm not sure I now what alt. means, what is alt. for that

    23           purpose?

    24                    THE WITNESS:  That's a -- in the UseNet news it's

    25           set up actually in a set of hierarchies, alt. is one of the

                                                                           111

     1           hierarchies being a list.  And there's broad categories,

     2           there's comp., which is anything about computers --

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, what is alt.?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  Alt. is alternative.  And, so, there's

     5           a set of discussion groups on just generally alternative

     6           topics.  There's a UseNet news group called Alt.Wired, which

     7           is where people talk about Wired magazine.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, people who are on or access

     9           this news group, if that's the right word --

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Correct.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- can talk about alternative

    12           sexual bondage, is that right?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  I personally have never been on that,

    14           so I don't know offhand, but presumably, given the name, that

    15           sounds right.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And to your knowledge is Hotwired

    17           on the list of groups or entities or services such as

    18           Surfwatch that would remain access to Hotwired from children

    19           should the parents select Surfwatch, do you know that?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  I am not familiar with how Surfwatch

    21           works specifically, but I --

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, I'm not asking you that, I'm

    23           asking you whether as far as you know Hotwired has been

    24           identified by parental control groups as a source that could

    25           be blocked or should be blocked from children under their

                                                                           112

     1           control?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  I know at one point we did a story on

     3           -- basically in response to the Time Magazine story about

     4           cyberporn that we called "Journaporn," and I actually believe

     5           it was filed as an exhibit.  I know at one point early on

     6           that was actually blocked because it contained the word porn

     7           in it, even though it didn't really have anything to do with

     8           pornography in that sense.  At that time we were blocked.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But you have other material that--

    10           is it correct that you have other material that -- besides

    11           the word porn which might subject it to blocking by those who

    12           want to shield minors from that material?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  I think --

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I mean, I've never heard of it

    15           before this case, so --

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I think there are certain pieces

    17           of Hotwired -- I mean, I'm a parent myself and there are

    18           certain pieces of Hotwired that I would not want my children

    19           to see, including the story on alt. sex bondage --

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But that's a news -- go ahead --

    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, I'm sorry.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But that's a news group, right?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  I think what's discussed here in

    24           Paragraph 8 is Wired Magazine wrote a story about the alt.

    25           sex bondage news group that then appeared in Wired Magazine

                                                                           113

     1           and was then, as part of Wired Magazine's place on Hotwired,

     2           appeared on Hotwired.  So, it is not actually the news group

     3           itself, it was an editorial about this news group.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I see.  And there is some of that

     5           material you would not want your own minors to see, is that

     6           correct?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

     8                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I was just going to say that, as

     9           I gather from your declaration, you as a content provider are

    10           doing nothing to identify the nature of your material or to

    11           make it inaccessible to people under 18, is that right?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct.

    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Whereas some content providers do

    14           that, am I correct about that, or make some effort to

    15           identify their material?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  I don't know of any offhand.  I mean,

    17           I think it's safe to say --

    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, maybe that's more of a

    19           technical area -- I'll let you answer, go ahead, what were

    20           you going to say?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  I mean, I think it's safe to say that

    22           we're certainly going to telegraph to -- you know, through

    23           our introduction pages what the content is about and people

    24           who might feel uncomfortable with the subject matter could at

    25           that time choose to go elsewhere.  So, we're never going to

                                                                           114

     1           as just part of our own editorial mission surprise people

     2           with something that they wouldn't necessarily want to see in

     3           that way, but I don't know of any system we're doing

     4           specifically nor of any other content providers that one by

     5           one says here is what our judgment is on each specific piece

     6           of content for any specific audience in that way.

     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay, that answers the question I

     8           asked you.  Okay, thank you.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Following up on Judge Buckwalter's

    10           question and also Chief Judge Sloviter's, in Paragraph 26 you

    11           talk about what I would call something of a Catch 22, that

    12           is, if you were to label a site adults-only that that would

    13           scare off advertisers, isn't that what you say there, that

    14           they would "wrongly categorize it as adult's erotic or

    15           pornographic site and, therefore, would be perceived as an

    16           undesirable advertiser vehicle," close-quote?

    17                    THE WITNESS:  I think advertisers tend to be

    18           conservative and something that on the face of it is listed

    19           as adults-only, regardless of what ends up being inside of

    20           it, it does get unfairly tarred.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But what I want to follow up on,

    22           since you're a content provider, are you familiar with this

    23           PICS proposal that is being noised about?

    24                    THE WITNESS:  I am familiar with it in general, I'm

    25           not familiar with any of the specifics of how it works.

                                                                           115

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, as I understand it from the

     2           declarations and the stipulation, it would involve self-

     3           rating.  How would you self-rate yourself?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  I really have to understand the system

     5           better, I think --

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, let's use motion picture

     7           ratings, if we could.

     8                    THE WITNESS:  I, to be honest, tend to have problems

     9           with --

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We assume you're being honest.

    11                    (Laughter.)

    12                    THE WITNESS:  No, I tend to have problems with

    13           things like the motion picture rating only in that, you know,

    14           what is R-rated is what's been decided by Hollywood.  I have

    15           seen plenty of R-rated films that I think have extremely

    16           violent content that I as a parent would never want my

    17           children to see, whereas I have seen -- I have seen content

    18           of a sexual nature that doesn't concern me anywhere near as

    19           much get much tougher ratings.  I think it's really -- the

    20           types of content ratings, if you will, that I would want to

    21           do would not be akin to an MPA, Motion Pictures Association.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But does that then say that whatever

    23           content ratings system is agreed to by the PICS group that

    24           you would not be interested in participating in it?  Because

    25           I take it you won't agree with every one of their

                                                                           116

     1           definitions.

     2                    THE WITNESS:  It depends -- if the nature of the

     3           PICS system is to identify the types of content, sexual

     4           nature, violence, language, that kind of thing, I think

     5           that's the kind of thing that I can agree with, and the

     6           understanding that then parents can decide what, given the

     7           age of their children and given their own sensibilities, they

     8           would like their children to see or not to see.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, given the Ginsberg-Clemente

    10           materials that you have for us here, how would you rate it

    11           using the motion picture rating system?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  I would have to really go back and

    13           look at it again, but, again, I'm not sure -- there is

    14           nothing that I saw in terms of the pictures necessarily that

    15           would concern me for my six-year-old to see.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  So, you would rate that G or

    17           PG?  Well, because you're going to be doing the self-rating. 

    18           As I understand the PICS system, you don't have to worry, you

    19           don't have to disagree with anybody, you can rate it

    20           yourself.  So, how would you rate it, G or PG or R?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Again, for my own personal

    22           sensibilities -- and one of the tough things that you have

    23           here is obviously what you're talking about as a parent

    24           personally versus -- I would say as a category it includes

    25           sexual material.  So, me as a parent -- I would say light

                                                                           117

     1           sexual material, you know, painting, not specific imagery of

     2           a photographic type or something of that sort, that's the

     3           kind of imagery that I would not have a problem with my

     4           children seeing.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The article on alt. sex bondage,

     6           however, would you rate that NC-17?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Again, I would say that that has

     8           explicit language, explicit language describing sexual

     9           content, which would be something that I probably would not

    10           want my children to see.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  And so since the alt.

    12           sex bondage is within Hotwired's service would you not as a

    13           general matter have to rate your whole system NC-17 because

    14           part of it is NC-17?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  One of the problems with the Web --

    16           and going to the home pages is -- it's very difficult,

    17           because it's not a front door in the same sense where you

    18           always have to hit the main site, ww.hotwired.com, there is

    19           no reason why someone can't come in directly into that

    20           Clemente piece, for instance.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Hyperlink into it?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Hyperlink right into it.  There's

    23           discussion about Allen Ginsberg someplace else and someone

    24           says, here's a very interesting store, link right to it, and

    25           the person doesn't know that they're on Hotwired necessarily,

                                                                           118

     1           they have no idea about the Netizen or Signals, some of our

     2           other sections, they're in a very specific subject.  So, you

     3           know, the idea that one specific piece of content would then

     4           void the entire system, it's really a number of different

     5           systems and you can hit at any different -- any one of a

     6           different number of ways.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, what you're highlighting is

     8           something we got into, I guess you weren't here the first two

     9           days, which is you would not only have to rate your service

    10           as a general matter, you would have to rate each item of

    11           information in it that could be hyperlinked into, correct?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  Again, I think you would -- there

    13           would even be no reason to necessarily do the entire system. 

    14           Every single piece of content, I've got about 10,000 pages on

    15           my site, we would need to go through every one of those

    16           10,000 pages and make a determination as to who we felt

    17           should or shouldn't see it.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Isn't that exactly the PICS proposal

    19           though?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Again, I am not overly familiar with

    21           the PICS proposal --

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, fine.

    23                    THE WITNESS:  -- and, so, I don't know.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What percent -- can you say what

    25           percentage of your material, about what percentage of your

                                                                           119

     1           material is sexual content?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  I don't know, it would be a very small

     3           number, a very small percent.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Really?  I see.  Okay, thank you.

     5                    Does counsel have any more?

     6                    MR. BLACKWELL:  None from the Government, your

     7           Honor.

     8                    MS. KAPPLER:  No questions, your Honor.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No questions you said?

    10                    MR. BLACKWELL:  Nothing for the Government.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you very much.

    12                    THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

    14                    (Discussion held off the record.)

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, next witness.

    16                    MR. HANSEN:  Does your Honor want to break for lunch

    17           at this point?  The next witness is likely to be somewhat --

    18           I think somewhat longer than the two we have just heard.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  Who is the next witness?

    20                    MR. HANSEN:  Harold Rheingold.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    23                    MR. HANSEN:  We're happy to start if that's the

    24           Court's preference.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, maybe we can do the technical

                                                                           120

     1           -- we're really concerned about the time, because we don't

     2           know how long -- I mean, you only have this day for this. 

     3           So, why -- if it's all right, why don't we get the technical

     4           aspect out and then you can start again -- or will that save

     5           any time?

     6                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honors, my name is Christopher

     7           Hansen, I'm one of the lawyers for the ACLU plaintiffs in

     8           this case, and the plaintiffs call Harold Rheingold.

     9                    Your Honor, Mr. Rheingold's declaration was signed

    10           on March 26th, 1996, plaintiffs move into evidence his

    11           declaration as his direct testimony.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Does the Government object or is --

    13                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Yes, your Honor, we do.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, you do?

    15                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Your Honor, if I may be permitted

    16           just a brief voir dire of the witness?

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Sure.  And you are?

    18                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  My name is Patricia Russotto, I

    19           represent the Department of Justice in this action.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, we saw you before, Ms.

    21           Russotto, but the tape doesn't remember.

    22                    HAROLD RHEINGOLD, Plaintiffs' Witness, Sworn.

    23                    THE COURT CLERK:  Thank you, please be seated. 

    24           Please state and spell your name.

    25                    THE WITNESS:  Harold Rheingold, 

                                                                           121

     1           R-h-e-i-n-g-o-l-d.

     2                               VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION

     3           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

     4           Q   Good afternoon, Mr. Rheingold.  Mr. Rheingold, you are

     5           here today to inform the Court about the formation of virtual

     6           communities on the Internet, are you not?

     7           A   That's correct.

     8           Q   Mr. Rheingold, you have not reviewed any of the on-line

     9           materials maintained by the plaintiffs, have you?

    10           A   No, I have not.

    11           Q   And you don't know whether the content of any of the

    12           plaintiff's on-line -- you don't know anything about the

    13           content of any of the plaintiff's on-line materials, do you?

    14           A   I'm not sure.  I may have seen material previous to this

    15           case that would be included in this.

    16           Q   But you have not reviewed any of that material in

    17           preparation for your opinion testimony today, have you?

    18           A   No, I have not.

    19           Q   And you don't know whether the plaintiffs host or

    20           participate in any sort of virtual communities in cyberspace,

    21           do you?

    22           A   No, I do not.

    23                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Your Honors, Mr. Rheingold is being

    24           offered here as an expert witness, he is not a plaintiff in

    25           this action, but it's not entirely clear to the Government

                                                                           122

     1           how his opinion is at all useful or helpful to the Court in

     2           understanding the evidence or determining any factual issues

     3           here.  Mr. Rheingold has -- as he just stated, has not

     4           reviewed any of the plaintiffs' Websites, he cannot say what

     5           they have on line, he does not know whether they participate

     6           in or host virtual communities.  And since he cannot relate

     7           his expertise, assuming there is some expertise, to any of

     8           the material that the plaintiffs have on line we would submit

     9           that his expert opinion, whatever it may be, is simply not

    10           relevant to these proceedings and --

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think the Court will accept it

    12           subject to striking and subject to whatever --

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, I think Mr. Hansen wanted to

    14           say something.

    15                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honors, Mr. Rheingold is being

    16           offered as an expert in the part of cyberspace that involves

    17           the formation of communities, news groups, chat rooms, other

    18           conversation.  It is the plaintiffs' position that cyberspace

    19           is not just about Worldwide Website, it is not just an

    20           electronic library, it is also a place in which people meet

    21           and converse and carry on conversations and form close

    22           friendships, Mr. Rheingold is being offered for the purpose

    23           of describing that sector of cyberspace and his declaration

    24           suggests that that section of cyberspace, the community-

    25           forming, the friendship-forming part will in fact be affected

                                                                           123

     1           by the Act.

     2                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, he's essentially a fact

     3           witness rather than an opinion witness, isn't he?

     4                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, I think he's both, your Honor. 

     5           He is the author of the leading book on this subject, it's

     6           called Virtual Communities, and as a result -- as part of

     7           that research for the book has traveled throughout the world,

     8           interviewing people who created communities in cyberspace.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The Court will hear Mr. Rheingold

    10           and if at the conclusion -- it will be accepted for what it's

    11           worth.

    12                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you, your Honor.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Thank you, Mr. Hansen, for your

    14           explanation.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now we will break for lunch --

    16                    (Laughter.)

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- having had the dispute of the

    18           day.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  1:30?

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  1:30, return at 1:30.

    21                    (Court in recess; 12:16 to 1:24 o'clock p.m.)

    22                    THE COURT CLERK:  Court is now in session.  Please

    23           be seated.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Proceed, Ms. Russotto.

    25                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

                                                                           124

     1           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

     2           Q   Good afternoon again, Mr. Rheingold.

     3                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Your Honor, there is one further

     4           matter with regard to Mr. Rheingold's declaration that we

     5           would like to point out.  We do have a hearsay objection to

     6           Paragraph 10, in which Mr. Rheingold testifies about some

     7           matters that other people told him about, we have obviously

     8           no opportunity to cross-examine anybody about that.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah, I would say that's hearsay.

    10                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Very well.

    11                    MR. HANSEN:  If I might be heard on that, your

    12           Honor?

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.

    15                    MR. HANSEN:  We have proffered Mr. Rheingold as an

    16           expert, I think he would testify that it is the kind of

    17           information he relied upon in writing his book --

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But what she's referring to is, "I

    19           have been told of at least one such space that as a result of

    20           the Act" --

    21                    MR. HANSEN:  That's right.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- it seems to me that's textbook

    23           hearsay.

    24                    MR. HANSEN:  He was told about that in the context

    25           of an affidavit that was submitted to him and which has been

                                                                           125

     1           submitted to the Government.  The Government has seen the

     2           evidentiary foundation for that particular paragraph and

     3           they're free to cross-examine him on further detail if they

     4           want, but I think as an expert he's entitled to rely upon

     5           that as the kind of information he has gathered in writing

     6           his book and the kind of information he uses in forming

     7           expert opinions.

     8                    (Pause.)

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, for what it's worth we'll

    10           let it in -- I mean, your point is well-taken.

    11                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Thank you, your Honor.

    12           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

    13           Q   Mr. Rheingold, would you please tell the Court what a

    14           virtual community is?

    15           A   A virtual community is a group of people who meet through

    16           on-line discussions and through those on-line discussions

    17           form individual relationships and often, but not always,

    18           continue those relationships into the face-to-face world.  I

    19           would make a distinction between communities of interest,

    20           let's say attorneys or engineers who exchange information,

    21           and communities that consist of many different kinds of

    22           people who have general discussions from which relationships

    23           which extend beyond the technical specifics of their

    24           information exchanges.

    25           Q   And virtual communities would be the latter, correct?

                                                                           126

     1           A   Yes, although they can form from the former.

     2           Q   And what virtual communities have you participated in

     3           yourself?

     4           A   I have participated for over ten years in a virtual

     5           community known as the WEL, before that in --

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The WEL?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  The WEL is an acronym for the whole

     8           earth electronic link, one of the oldest of the communities

     9           that allow low-cost access to individuals who are not

    10           particularly specialists.  At the time that the WEL was

    11           formed you really had to be a government researcher to have

    12           access to the ArpaNet (ph.).  So, this was really a

    13           pioneering experiment that continues to this day.

    14           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

    15           Q   In addition to the WEL what other virtual communities

    16           have you --

    17           A   Before the WEL I explored a number of bulletin-board

    18           systems, particularly one known as the Skateboard that I

    19           participated in for some time before the WEL.  More recently

    20           I have become involved in creating a new virtual community

    21           known as the River, which is one that is a cooperative

    22           corporation owned by the members of the community.  I have

    23           participated in virtual communities in Japan, two of them in

    24           particular -- three of them in particular, Twix (ph.) and

    25           Aegis (ph.) and Koara (ph.), which I describe in my book; a

                                                                           127

     1           community in France known as Calvidose (ph.); a community in

     2           England known as Kicks.

     3           Q   All right.

     4           A   In addition to those there are mailing lists, MUD's and

     5           MUSE's and UseNet news groups.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, I'll take the bait,

     7           what's a MUD?

     8                    (Laughter.)

     9                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  I was going to get to that.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  A MUD is an on-line forum like others

    11           in which people can log in remotely, select an identity.  And

    12           essentially it's a place where instead of a professional

    13           creating entertainment you create your own entertainment. 

    14           You make yourself a dwarf or a wizard or a princess and

    15           describe yourself textually, so that others who issue the

    16           command to look at you when you enter a room see your

    17           description of yourself as a wizard or a princess, and then

    18           you have conversations and make up adventures.  There's a

    19           large number of these, hundreds if not thousands of these

    20           that exist.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Does MUD stands for something?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  It originally stood for multi-user

    23           dungeons, because it came from the Dungeons and Dragons

    24           fantasy role-playing games.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, I'll take the bait on MUSE.

                                                                           128

     1                    THE WITNESS:  These are... as many of these on-line

     2           forums tend to evolve into forums that were not originally

     3           intended the MUD's, which were originally kind of games that

     4           teenage boys played with each other, were seen by some to be

     5           educational environments in which instead of having a fantasy

     6           world you could talk about mathematics or astronomy or social

     7           studies.  So, multi-user simulation environments, i.e. MUSE,

     8           evolved as a place where not primarily game playing, but

     9           learning through role playing with simulations is the purpose

    10           of the social gathering.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  There you have it.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I don't know about wizards, but I

    13           have a feeling princesses aren't so happy nowadays, I'm not

    14           sure why somebody would want to be a princess.

    15                    (Laughter.)

    16           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

    17           Q   Mr. Rheingold, in the virtual communities that you have

    18           described for us that form around these -- initially form

    19           around the interest group discussions that you're talking

    20           about, the interest -- the topics, you have yourself

    21           participated in virtual communities built around a wide

    22           variety of issues, right?

    23           A   Yes.

    24           Q   And you're aware the virtual communities, some of the

    25           topics would include AIDS, for example, right?

                                                                           129

     1           A   Yes.

     2           Q   Sexual abuse of children would be another example?

     3           A   Yes.

     4           Q   Sex education of children?

     5           A   Yes.

     6           Q   Breast cancer support groups, correct?

     7           A   Yes.

     8           Q   Gender discrimination support groups --

     9           A   Yes.

    10           Q   -- and discussion groups?  A general discourse about

    11           politics, right?

    12           A   Yes.

    13           Q   Now, sometimes the participants in these communities may

    14           describe sexual activity in explicit terms in the course of

    15           these discussions, correct?

    16           A   That's correct.

    17           Q   And sometimes they may use street or colloquial language

    18           to make a point, right?

    19           A   That's correct.

    20           Q   And sometimes they may use an expletive in the heat of

    21           argument or debate, right?

    22           A   That's correct.

    23           Q   And your concern is that under the CDA participants in

    24           these virtual communities could be prosecuted for using

    25           explicit sexual language in discussing AIDS, right?

                                                                           130

     1           A   That's correct.

     2           Q   Or for discussing -- using that kind of language,

     3           explicit sexual language in discussing the sexual abuse of

     4           children?

     5           A   That's correct.

     6           Q   Or breast cancer?

     7           A   That's correct.

     8           Q   Or any of the other topics that we just went through?

     9           A   That's correct.

    10           Q   Or for using expletives in heated discourse?

    11           A   Yes.

    12           Q   Indeed, didn't you tell me that you were concerned that

    13           discussions of Shakespeare's Hamlet might be subject to -- or

    14           might subject a virtual community member to prosecution under

    15           the CDA because of the sexual puns in Hamlet?

    16           A   That's correct.

    17           Q   Now, do you really think that Hamlet depicts or describes

    18           in terms patently offensive, as measured by contemporary

    19           community standards, sexual or excretory activities or

    20           organs?

    21           A   I fear, because of my knowledge of the successful

    22           attempts to remove books such as Tom Sawyer and the Diary of

    23           Anne Frank from school libraries that the definition of what

    24           may be offensive may indeed extend to Shakespeare, if it can

    25           extend to Anne Frank and Mark Twain, yes.

                                                                           131

     1           Q   You're also concerned that images of Michelangelo's

     2           "David" that might appear in virtual community discussions

     3           that might subject members to the -- members of the community

     4           to prosecution under the CDA, right?

     5           A   Yes, other classical works of art that depict full-

     6           frontal nudity.

     7           Q   And you think that Michelangelo's "David" and other

     8           classical works of art that depict full-frontal nudity -- or

     9           do you think that these types of works depict or describe in

    10           terms patently offensive, as measured by contemporary

    11           community standards, sexual or excretory activities or

    12           organs?

    13           A   Which contemporary community?  Standards in my household

    14           regard works of art as not being offensive.  I am aware that

    15           there are people who live in my neighborhood who do find that

    16           offensive.

    17           Q   Now, you have not participated in any virtual communities

    18           that are built around the posting of sexually-explicitly

    19           images, have you?

    20                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  What -- I didn't hear that, I'm

    21           sorry.

    22                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  I'm sorry, I'll repeat that.

    23           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

    24           Q   You have not participated in any virtual communities that

    25           are built around the posting of sexually-explicit images,

                                                                           132

     1           have you?

     2           A   Not to my knowledge.

     3           Q   You're familiar with bulletin-board systems, right?

     4           A   Yes.

     5           Q   Would you just briefly explain what those are?

     6           A   A bulletin-board system is as simple as an inexpensive

     7           personal computer with a modem, some simple software on it

     8           that you plug into your telephone, and publicize the

     9           telephone number and encourage people to log in, read and

    10           write, publish and converse.  I understand that there are

    11           more than 70,000 bulletin board systems in North America now.

    12           Q   And in your experience do virtual communities form around

    13           some of these bulletin-board systems?

    14           A   Yes, they do.  I have participated in such and

    15           participate in discussions with people who participate in

    16           them.

    17           Q   Now, some of these bulletin-board systems are commercial,

    18           are they not?

    19           A   Yes, they are.

    20           Q   And they require a credit card for access, right?

    21           A   Yes, some of them do.

    22           Q   And some of these bulletin-board systems require a user

    23           to register and receive a password before viewing the

    24           material that's posted to the bulletin board, correct?

    25           A   That's correct.

                                                                           133

     1           Q   And some bulletin-board systems in fact require a higher

     2           access status in order to gain access to certain discussions

     3           on the bulletin board, isn't that right?

     4           A   That's correct.

     5           Q   Now, I'm going to refer you to Exhibit 90, Defendant's

     6           Exhibit 90, these are excerpts from your -- the paperback

     7           version of your book, The Virtual Community.  And at Page 142

     8           of your book you state, "A bulletin-board system or BBS is

     9           open to anyone who wants to call in.  You have to stick

    10           around for a while, perhaps meet the SISOP (ph.) in person to

    11           be granted access to more restricted discussions that take

    12           place among the inner circle of the same BBS."

    13           A   Yes.

    14           Q   Is that correct?  So, not everyone can participate in

    15           these higher-access discussions, correct?

    16           A   That's correct.

    17           Q   And there is an inner core of participants that are just

    18           granted access to those restricted discussions, right?

    19           A   That's correct.

    20           Q   And in fact you would need a special password for the

    21           system operator in order to gain access to the files -- to

    22           some files that are not accessible to other participants,

    23           right?

    24           A   Not necessarily.  The system operator could have a list

    25           of registered users who have access to certain material that

                                                                           134

     1           was not --

     2           Q   So, then you would have to register to gain access to

     3           this restricted list of materials on the bulletin board?

     4           A   Yes.

     5           Q   Now, you're aware, are you not, that sexually-explicit

     6           material is posted to some bulletin-board systems, right?

     7           A   Yes.

     8           Q   And could virtual communities form around the posting of

     9           images and text messages on sexually-explicit bulletin-board

    10           systems?

    11           A   Certainly I can think of instances where that could be

    12           the case.

    13           Q   And those bulletin-board systems could require a user to

    14           enter a credit card number for access to those images and

    15           discussions, correct?

    16           A   It's technically possible, yes.

    17           Q   And they could also -- those bulletin-board systems that

    18           accept postings or have postings of sexually-explicit images

    19           and text, they could require registration or receipt of a

    20           password for access to the site, right?

    21           A   That's correct.

    22           Q   And those types of bulletin-board systems could require a

    23           higher access, as we were just talking about, to restrict a

    24           minor's ability to gain access to the sexually-explicit

    25           materials, correct?

                                                                           135

     1           A   Yes.

     2           Q   And restricting access to exclude minors from viewing the

     3           sexually-explicit material on a bulletin-board system would

     4           not substantially alter the adult virtual community formed

     5           around that bulletin-board system, would it?

     6           A   I'm not sure, it would depend on the circumstances.  If

     7           that in effect removed minors from a large range of

     8           discussions which may have sexual content rather than simply

     9           downloading images, for example, then I think that that --

    10           that could be substantially damaging to their participation.

    11           Q   Yes, but we're talking about those bulletin-board systems

    12           that post and discuss sexually-explicit material, depictions

    13           of explicit sexual activities, you're saying that you think

    14           there are certain circumstances in which it would damage the

    15           community, that community to exclude minors from viewing

    16           those kinds of images?

    17           A   Certainly -- if you would permit, I can cite an example. 

    18           If you were, for example, a gay teenager in a small town who

    19           felt that maybe you were the only person in the world who had

    20           certain feelings, and those feelings do have to do with

    21           explicit sexual acts or imagining certain sexual acts, and

    22           there are a number of people like that who are at risk of

    23           suicide and depression, that being unable to participate in

    24           discussions with others who might be able to tell them that

    25           they're not alone, that instance would I think be damaging. 

                                                                           136

     1           And, again, the definition of whether it's obscene or whether

     2           it could be offensive to some I think in my mind is kind of

     3           fuzzy and would exclude what I think would be very healthy

     4           discussions for some people.

     5           Q   So, you're assuming an educational value then to the

     6           material, sexually -- explicit images of sexual activity,

     7           you're assuming an educational value to that material?

     8           A   Well, as I understand it and I'm not an attorney,

     9           obscenity has to do with the lack of socially-redeeming

    10           value.  So, I would --

    11           Q   I understand, that's --

    12           A   -- say socially-redeeming value would be educational

    13           value, for example.

    14           Q   All right.  Now, children represent only a small

    15           percentage of the number of participants in the virtual

    16           communities that you're aware of, isn't that right?

    17           A   In some.  In others, such as the MUD's and MUSE's, I

    18           think that they are a substantial minority or even a

    19           majority.

    20           Q   Okay.  So, in the MUD's and MUSE's there are a

    21           substantial number of minors?

    22           A   Yes.

    23           Q   But in others it's mostly adults that are participating

    24           in those virtual communities?

    25           A   Yes.

                                                                           137

     1           Q   Now, I think your affidavit talks about your daughter

     2           using the Internet, correct?

     3           A   That's correct.

     4           Q   And you've said that she uses that to E-mail messages to

     5           her friends, right?

     6           A   And to use search engines to do research for her

     7           homework.

     8           Q   And your daughter is 11 years old, right?

     9           A   That is correct.

    10           Q   And you don't supervise your daughter all throughout the

    11           time that she is using the computer, do you?

    12           A   No, I do not.

    13           Q   Do you use any of the parental blocking software to block

    14           access to certain sites?

    15           A   No, I do not.  I believe it's important to teach my

    16           daughter to make moral choices and I have made her aware that

    17           there are -- that there is material out there that would be

    18           unhealthy for her if she choose to access it.

    19           Q   And your advice to her is simply not to put it into her

    20           mind, correct?

    21           A   My advice to her is that, just as she knows that there

    22           are nutritious things to put in her body, there are

    23           nutritious things to put in her mind.  And if she comes

    24           across or has sent to her material that she feels is harmful

    25           she should drag it to the trash, which is the way you delete

                                                                           138

     1           material on a screen, or she should show it to me.

     2           Q   Now, you're familiar with the UseNet news groups, right?

     3           A   Yes, I am.

     4           Q   And in your opinion do virtual communities form around

     5           these UseNet news groups?

     6           A   They can, they do.

     7           Q   All right.  And some of these news groups are moderated,

     8           right?

     9           A   Yes.

    10           Q   And would you tell us or explain what happens in a

    11           moderated news group?

    12           A   In an unmoderated news group anyone who wants to

    13           participate by posting something will simply issue the

    14           command to send it to that news group, and it will

    15           automatically be published and read by others who subscribe. 

    16           In a moderated news group that posting goes to a moderator

    17           and the moderator decides whether to publish it or not.

    18           Q   And you yourself hosted a moderated news group, right?

    19           A   Yes, I did, I started one.

    20           Q   And you moderated it to essentially say that this is

    21           polite conversation and if you make trouble your words won't

    22           show up, right?

    23           A   Yes.  And also, I think to extend that, I was interested

    24           in creating a forum for serious scientific discussion and not

    25           arguments about science fiction.

                                                                           139

     1           Q   But you retained some discretion over what was posted in

     2           the news group that you moderated, right?

     3           A   Yes.  I received all of the postings before they were

     4           posted and gave the command to post them.  There was not in

     5           fact a single instance in which I choose not to publish

     6           something.

     7           Q   But you could have?

     8           A   I could have, that's correct.

     9           Q   You are aware, are you not, that adult news groups

    10           containing sexually-explicit materials exist on UseNet,

    11           right?

    12           A   Yes.

    13           Q   Now, I'm going to refer you again to another excerpt from

    14           your book on Page 131, this is Exhibit 90.  

    15                    (Pause.)

    16           Q   And I'm looking at the continuing paragraph at the top of

    17           Page 131, you say that "If a local group does not want to

    18           carry a news group or wants to block access to UseNet by

    19           certain users it's possible to do so."  That's correct,

    20           right?

    21           A   That's correct.

    22           Q   And by local group you mean a server or an ISP?

    23           A   Yes.

    24           Q   Internet service provider?

    25           A   Yes.

                                                                           140

     1           Q   And the administrator of the server or the Internet

     2           service provider could just decide not to carry certain news

     3           groups, right?

     4           A   That is correct.

     5           Q   So, they could decide not to carry some of the news

     6           groups in the alt.sex hierarchy, right?

     7           A   Yes, they could, although if you provide access to the

     8           Internet it's not necessary to have access to the news groups

     9           that that particular Internet service provider keeps on their

    10           server, you could for example go to another server.

    11           Q   But you would have to have an account on that other

    12           server, right?

    13           A   Not necessarily.  There might -- and in fact I'm quite

    14           sure there are places where you can have access to news

    15           groups without having a password, you could have guest --

    16           they could be open to guest accounts, for example.

    17           Q   Mm-hmm, but the server that -- the particular server that

    18           you have an account on could decide not to carry the alt.sex

    19           hierarchy or the alt.binaries hierarchy, right?

    20           A   That's correct.

    21           Q   And you talked about MUD's and MUSE's a little bit and

    22           you've explained what those are, is it your opinion that

    23           virtual communities can develop around those kinds of fantasy

    24           worlds?

    25           A   Yes, I have experienced them.

                                                                           141

     1           Q   Okay, how does that happen?

     2           A   If people, and here we're talking about young people as

     3           well as older people, find for example that they don't have

     4           the intellectual stimulation or the kind of specific

     5           mentoring in mathematics or literature, whatever they're

     6           interested in, in their geographic vicinity and they go to a

     7           MUSE, such as the one I described at MIT or one I have

     8           written about in Phoenix, Arizona, and find an atmosphere in

     9           which people are friendly and help them understand that

    10           material and can teach them in a way that maybe they're not

    11           going to be able to learn at home or in their local school,

    12           then that would become an important resource for them.  In

    13           general, these communities are social places where it isn't

    14           just the learning or the game playing, but the communication

    15           with others, casual communications with others that you

    16           encounter there, that seems to be the attraction.

    17           Q   And to participate in those kinds of fantasy worlds you

    18           have to be issued a password, is that right?

    19           A   Almost all MUD's and MUSE's have a guest account that

    20           does not require a password.  If you want to become a citizen

    21           of that community and create a character that has an ongoing

    22           presence then you need to register.

    23           Q   So, a guest would just allow you to peek in and see

    24           what's going on, right?

    25           A   A guest could peek in and a guest could have

                                                                           142

     1           conversations and participate, but that guest would only be

     2           designated as Guest 1 or Guest 2 and would not establish an

     3           identity that had an ongoing identity.

     4           Q   Now, these fantasy worlds often prescribe certain rules

     5           of behavior for their participants, don't they?

     6           A   Sometimes they do, yes.

     7           Q   And in your book you have talked about the virtual

     8           community called Cyberion City, correct?

     9           A   Yes.

    10           Q   And at Page 160 of your book you say that the Cyberion

    11           City charter warns you when you enter that there are children

    12           there and educators and librarians and people having fun, and

    13           anybody who abuses the rule of polite communication is likely

    14           to have his or her character removed, correct?

    15           A   That's correct.

    16           Q   And the rules of polite communication in Cyberion City

    17           preclude using sexually-explicit language, right?

    18           A   Yes.

    19           Q   And they also preclude explicit discussions of excretory

    20           activity, correct?

    21           A   Yes, as far as I know.

    22           Q   Well, you have written about it, right?

    23           A   Yes.

    24           Q   And participants in Cyberion City can be removed from the

    25           community for violating those rules of the road, right?

                                                                           143

     1           A   Yes.  I would add, however, that it's important to note

     2           that the charter of Cyberion City was created by the

     3           participants, that was the particular charter that they

     4           agreed upon and there are indeed others that I didn't write

     5           about that have different rules.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Cyberion, for purposes of the

     7           record, is C-y-b-e-r-i-o-n, not with an S, as some of us

     8           might have thought.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, by listening.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right.

    11           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

    12           Q   But if the participants do violate these rules that are

    13           agreed upon then they can be removed from the community,

    14           right?

    15           A   They can be removed.  In this case there is also a due

    16           process built into the charter, and complaints can lead to

    17           trials and juries of peers and appeals.

    18           Q   And they can be removed?

    19           A   And they can be removed.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  How are the judges appointed?

    21                    (Laughter.)

    22                    THE WITNESS:  To my knowledge, they are selected by

    23           the members of the community.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Do they have impeachment?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  I would suspect so.  Anything that

                                                                           144

     1           comes up when you're trying to run a judicial apparatus comes

     2           up in a community like this and there are attempts to create

     3           mechanisms for dealing with them.  In this particular case

     4           and others that I know of those are regarded as educational

     5           opportunities whereby students can understand what due

     6           process means.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do you have to have a passport that

     8           makes you below 18 to get into them?

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No.  You need to understand the

    10           language and quite under -- quite often you need to

    11           participate in discussions with minors to understand that.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And if some of us are finding this

    13           world a little difficult, judges and otherwise, we can just

    14           escape into that one?

    15                    (Laughter.)

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I sometimes say as a joke, but

    17           it's not really a joke, that if you really want to understand

    18           the on-line world you need to get a 17 or 18-year-old to sit

    19           with you.

    20           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

    21           Q   And in other fantasy communities besides Cyberion City

    22           that you're familiar with, someone with a route password

    23           could remove a participant that doesn't comply with the rules

    24           of those communities, right?

    25           A   Yes, they have the power to do that.

                                                                           145

     1           Q   Right.  Are there discussions or descriptions of explicit

     2           sexual activity that occur in some of these fantasy worlds?

     3           A   Yes.

     4           Q   Now, participants in these fantasy worlds can build parts

     5           of the fantasy environment themselves, can't they?

     6           A   That's correct.

     7           Q   And they would basically program a room or a section of

     8           the environment, is that right?

     9           A   Yes, they can not only communicate, but they can create

    10           behaviors that are contingent upon things that happen.

    11           Q   And the creator of a particular environment could program

    12           it to exclude certain people from that environment, right?

    13           A   Yes.

    14           Q   Or, conversely, only to allow certain people in, the same

    15           thing, I guess?

    16           A   Yes.

    17           Q   So, these rooms could be programmed to exclude minors,

    18           for example?

    19           A   Yes.

    20           Q   And rooms where there are discussions of explicit sexual

    21           activity could be programmed to exclude minors?

    22           A   Yes.

    23           Q   And in your view it would not be detrimental to the

    24           community of this fantasy environment for some minors to be

    25           excluded from rooms where explicit sexual discussions are

                                                                           146

     1           going on, right?

     2           A   Well, again, I would cite an instance of where some minor

     3           was having a problem with sexuality, which might well be

     4           helped by participating in those discussions.

     5           Q   Okay.  I would ask you to take a look at Page 149 of your

     6           deposition.  And I think it might be useful to talk about

     7           some of the -- a discussion that we had during your

     8           deposition of this point.

     9                    (Pause.)

    10           Q   Question:  "Do you think it would be beneficial to the

    11           community to exclude minors from accessing rooms where that

    12           type of description of explicit sexual activity is going on?"

    13                    Answer:  "It's hard to tell.

    14                    "Why?"

    15                    Answer:  I can think of instances from this

    16           affidavit in which it would damage the community by causing

    17           people to lie about their age.  I would also wonder where the

    18           distinction between explicit sexual conversation and adult

    19           conversation was designated."

    20                    Question:  "Well, would the beneficial or

    21           detrimental effect on the community perhaps depend on the age

    22           of the minor?"

    23                    Answer:  "Yes, I think yes.  I think that for an

    24           elementary school student it would be much more inappropriate

    25           than for a high school or college student."

                                                                           147

     1                    Question:  "Why do you think it might be more

     2           inappropriate for an elementary school student to be allowed

     3           access to one of these rooms in a MUD where sexual activity

     4           is going on?"

     5                    Answer:  "For one thing, they haven't undergone

     6           puberty; for another thing, probably for that reason they

     7           haven't had any sexual education; and, for another thing,

     8           their level of maturity would be presumably generally lower,

     9           although of course you find very mature young people and very

    10           immature older people."

    11                    Question:  "So, it might not be a benefit to the

    12           community to have an elementary school student be given

    13           access to those types of rooms on the MUD?"

    14                    Answer:  "That's correct."

    15                    That was your testimony, correct?

    16           A   That's correct.

    17           Q   And the last question I have for you, in your book you

    18           talk about a "digital convergence of media," what do you mean

    19           by that?

    20           A   Well, I mean that what we're talking about here, the

    21           Internet and bulletin-board systems, are systems in which

    22           material that resides on computers is sent through

    23           communication wires, we're seeing that voice and images and

    24           software, as well as words, can be converted to digital form

    25           and sent through wires.

                                                                           148

     1           Q   Okay, thank you.

     2                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  May I have just a moment, your Honor?

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Sure.

     4                    (Pause.)

     5                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  I have nothing further.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Any redirect?

     7                    MR. HANSEN:  Just one question, your Honor.

     8                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION

     9           BY MR. HANSEN:  

    10           Q   Mr. Rheingold, as MUSE's and MUD's are currently set up

    11           do the participants know whether the other participants are

    12           adults or minors?

    13           A   No.

    14                    MR. HANSEN:  That's all I have, your Honor.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Judge Dalzell?

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No questions from me.

    17                    (Discussion held off the record.)

    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  The one thing in your

    19           declaration, sir, that is not really relevant, but I wonder

    20           what you meant by "among the many things left out of the

    21           distorted popular image of the Internet are people from whom

    22           the Net is a lifeline," what did you mean by the distorted

    23           pop -- what is the distorted popular image?

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I know personally disabled

    25           people, people who are --

                                                                           149

     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, no, no, I meant what's the

     2           distorted popular image you're referring to?  Is it your

     3           feeling that --

     4                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I travel a lot and I speak a lot

     5           and almost everything that I hear -- I'm also called by the

     6           media for quotes a lot, almost everything that I'm asked is

     7           about porno on the Net.  And I think that the distortion is

     8           that you turn your computer on and porno comes flooding

     9           through the screen --

    10                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay, that's what you meant by

    11           that.

    12                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I wondered, because I would

    14           consider myself to be part of the public --

    15                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    16                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- and I want to know what this

    17           distortion is that I am --

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Well, do you --

    19                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  And you have explained to me what

    20           you thought the distortion was, thank you.

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.

    22                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Thank you.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  As I understand it, and I didn't

    24           until yesterday and I'm not sure I do, but what we're talking

    25           about in MUSE's and MUD's -- and stop me if I'm -- or correct

                                                                           150

     1           me, please, if I'm incorrect -- is that there is some kind of

     2           interactive fantasy world out there in which participants

     3           take on new personalities or different personalities, a bit

     4           like a masquerade, and this permits them to discuss with each

     5           other or among each other whatever they want to, is that

     6           correct?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  No, I think that is not an adequate

     8           description, if it was only that it probably wouldn't be

     9           popular.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, and in the -- I guess in the

    11           -- I don't -- and in the process they may --

    12                    THE WITNESS:  Could I add just a little bit to that?

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, no.  I mean, in the process

    14           they may get educated or get their feelings out, et cetera,

    15           is that -- I just want to know --

    16                    THE WITNESS:  No, you're leaving something out,

    17           which is it's not just creating a fantasy character and

    18           having conversations, but you can actually create the

    19           environment itself, which exists independent of your presence

    20           in it.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right, let's leave that for the

    22           existentialists and go back to what we have here.

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it's important for children who

    24           for example might be interested in C. S. Lewis to be able to

    25           create their own "Narnia."

                                                                           151

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But is this uniquely for children

     2           or primarily for children?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  No.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What percentage of this

     5           communication is sexual in nature, do you have any idea?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  I can't tell you precisely, but my

     7           guess would be it's under ten percent.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And the material that's not sexual

     9           in nature what do they -- what is the subject matter?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  The subject matter --

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I haven't read your books yet,

    12           so...

    13                    THE WITNESS:  -- could be adventure, science

    14           fiction, classical literature.  There are places that I have

    15           described in school districts that study ancient Egypt, for

    16           example, or other historical places, not imaginary places.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is this used, to your knowledge, by

    18           schools and school districts?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, it is.  There's -- the MUSE in 

    20           -- called MariMUSE in Maricopa County, that's an example,

    21           that's in Phoenix, Arizona; one of the poorest school

    22           districts in the nation, a place where a very small

    23           percentage of the students have -- their students speak

    24           English; this is a place where college students from Phoenix

    25           College and teachers from the school and young children

                                                                           152

     1           participate in discussions of, for example, ancient Egypt or

     2           create -- recreate ancient Egypt and in fact bring their

     3           parents in to show them, and in some instances teach their

     4           parents English.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So that on the screen at this time

     6           is like an Egyptian city, is that what you're --

     7                    THE WITNESS:  You would give the -- you would say,

     8           show me what's here, and you would then see a description

     9           written by students that would say, there are pyramids in the

    10           distance.  And you could say, approach the pyramid, they

    11           could then using words describe what it is you see, so in

    12           that sense create an Egyptian city.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But it's all in language rather

    14           than in pictures?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  It's all in language.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  Now, at Paragraph 10 of your

    17           declaration you state that some MUD's or MUSE's have designed

    18           methods to ban minors from these communities, what sort of

    19           methods do they use?  

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Well, in this instance I was informed

    21           by the young man that the people who administered this MUSE 

    22           -- this MUD were afraid of the consequences of the CDA and

    23           asked minors to identify themselves.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But they're totally dependent then,

    25           are they not, on self-identification?

                                                                           153

     1                    THE WITNESS:  In this instance, yes.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, in any -- you said yes to a

     3           number of questions about that and I -- 

     4                    THE WITNESS:  Well, there's really no difference

     5           between a MUD or a MUSE or any other site on the Internet to

     6           which you need to log in.  If you need to log into this they

     7           can require a password and they can require you to register

     8           to get that password.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But how would it be enforced as

    10           applicable to minors?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Well, you could require them to give

    12           you a credit card number that you would verify.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, you mean --

    14                    THE WITNESS:  It would require someone on the other

    15           end to go through the process of verifying the credit card.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, now I'm really confused.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Sorry.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The host of this MUD, certainly a

    20           MUD, the host of this is more often than not a child or

    21           somebody young.

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I wouldn't say more often than

    23           not, but certainly there are hosts who are children.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, but they're not going to

    25           verify credit card numbers, how would they do that?

                                                                           154

     1                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct, they're not going to

     2           be able to do that.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I guess Chief Judge Sloviter and I

     4           are perplexed because Ms. Russotto asked you a number of

     5           questions about these MUD's and MUSE's being, her term,

     6           programmable --

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- to exclude minors and you readily

     9           answered yes to all of those questions.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  You can do the programming, that's not

    11           the same thing as doing the verification.  The tools exist to

    12           exclude anyone you want, you can simply say Person A with

    13           Password B can't get in.  Now, determining the age of that

    14           person and verifying I think is a different matter from

    15           technically is it possible to do.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, in other words, to get into the

    17           MUD or the MUSE you would have to have -- well, you have to

    18           have a password anyway, right, that someone gives you?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Many of them say on the screen when

    20           you enter register as guest, with password guest.  So, you

    21           don't necessarily have to have a secret password.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But then if you're going to be a

    23           permanent member what do you do, you write in using the U.S.

    24           Postal Service?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  If you want to be -- yes, if you want

                                                                           155

     1           to be a permanent member then you go through a registration

     2           procedure.  And quite often what that consists of is giving

     3           them a name, not necessarily your legal identity, and an E-

     4           mail address, and they will then E-mail the password to that

     5           E-mail address.  And what they're concerned about is not so

     6           much who you are, but that the person who you claim to be

     7           today is the same person you claim to be tomorrow.  Otherwise

     8           you could have someone calling themselves Howard on day one

     9           and another person on day two adopting that identity and

    10           doing all kinds of things that Howard might not want to be

    11           identified with.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And who is the they who gives the

    13           password?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it's the system administrator. 

    15           A system administrator is the person, whether it's because

    16           they're in a university and they've been given that power by

    17           the administration or because they own a computer and they

    18           have connected it to the network who has the route password,

    19           does that -- is that term clear to you --

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The route --

    21                    THE WITNESS:  -- the route password?  

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well --

    23                    THE WITNESS:  The person who has control of the

    24           computer system has technical control over everything that

    25           happens, can throw anyone off, can admit who they want, can

                                                                           156

     1           erase the data base if they choose.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What harm would happen if all

     3           sexual content was removed?  It's less than ten percent and

     4           they could still play their castles-in-the-air, what would

     5           happen?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  I would like to have a specific

     7           definition of sexual content to --

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, I asked you how much of it

     9           involved sexual activity, et cetera, and you said less than

    10           ten percent, whatever you meant in answering I meant in

    11           asking.

    12                    (Laughter.)

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Okay, could you repeat that?  What

    14           harm would there be?

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, what would happen if -- to the

    16           extent that they knew that all the games that were -- that

    17           could be played were limited to games that had non-sexual

    18           activity?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it's -- if you're talking about

    20           games, I don't see a problem --

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, I call it games, I mean, you

    22           become --

    23                    THE WITNESS:  -- discussion --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- a different person -- yes?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  As I said, I have named an instance in

                                                                           157

     1           which I think it could be harmful to ban discussions of

     2           sexual behavior, those in which there is an educational

     3           component.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But that would be a MUSE?

     5                    THE WITNESS:  It could be.  And I think it's

     6           important to note that this entire communications medium is

     7           one that evolves and changes.  MUD's used to be for college

     8           students having -- having fun, pretending to be play Dungeons

     9           and Dragons, now they're becoming educational environments. 

    10           It's hard to tell what they're going to become in the future. 

    11           So, I'm being careful with my answers because I would want to

    12           be careful about exactly how I would constrain how these

    13           things can grow, because what they are today is not

    14           necessarily what they're going to be tomorrow.  And in fact

    15           in my book I wrote about the fact that the Internet would not

    16           be here if the people who created it stuck to the rules of

    17           what you were supposed to do.  You weren't really supposed to

    18           communicate, it was really just for government researchers --



    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, we have seen --

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, we have been over that.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We have been over that.

    22                    THE WITNESS:  right.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Did our questions elicit -- our

    24           attempt at understanding this, did that elicit any questions

                                                                           158

     1           from either side?

     2                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No questions from the Government,

     3           your Honor.

     4                    MR. HANSEN:  No, your Honor.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, thank you very much.

     6                    (Witness excused.)
