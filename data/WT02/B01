<h2>ANSWERS TO FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT MARIJUANA USE </h2>

<h1>What is DEP? </h1>

<p>The Drug Education Project (DEP) is an attempt to clear up the
misinformation being propagated in the U.S. by organizations and
individuals more interested in creating works of propaganda and
fear than objective pieces of education. DEP is founded upon the
same two basic principles Andrew Weil bases his book, From
Chocolate to Morphine, upon: (1) &quot;People make decisions on
the basis of information available to them. The more accurate the
information, the better their decisions will be&quot; [68, p.
179]; and (2) &quot;There are no good or bad drugs; there are
only good and bad relationships with drugs&quot; [68, p. 27].
This leaflet is the first in a series of sixteen that will
attempt to summarize for everyone what science has to say about
drug use. The grunt work has been done for you. DEP only requests
of you an open mind and the time required to read these leaflets.

<h3>Health Risk Myths and Realities </h3>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Marijuana
Overdose </h4>

<p>No evidence exists that anyone has ever died of a marijuana
overdose [61, p. 53 - 54]. Tests performed on mice have shown
that the ratio of cannabinoids (the chemicals in marijuana that
make you stoned) necessary for overdose to the amount necessary
for intoxication is 40,000:1 [1]. For comparison's sake, that
ratio for alcohol is generally between 4:1 and 10:1 [61, p.
227-228]. Alcohol overdoses kill about 5,000 yearly [3] but
marijuana overdoses kill no one as far as anyone can tell. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Brain
Damage </h4>

<p>Marijuana is psychoactive because it stimulates certain brain
receptors, but it does not produce toxins that kill them [7]
(like alcohol), and it does not wear them out as other drugs may
[57]. There is no evidence that marijuana use is a cause of brain
damage. Studies by Dr. Robert Heath claimed the contrary in
experiments on monkeys [4], but Heath's work has been sharply
criticized by the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy
of Sciences on three primary counts: </p>

<ol>
    <li>its insufficient sample size (only four monkeys), </li>
    <li>its failure to control experimental bias, and </li>
    <li>its misidentification of normal monkey brain structure as
        &quot;damaged&quot; [5]. </li>
</ol>

<p>A far superior experiment by the National Center for
Toxicological Research (NCTR) involving 64 rhesus monkeys that
were exposed to daily or weekly doses of marijuana smoke for a
year found no evidence of structural or neurochemical changes in
the brains of rhesus monkeys [6, 58]. Studies performed on actual
human populations will confirm these results, even for chronic
marijuana users (up to 18 joints per day) after many years of use
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In fact, following the publication of two
1977 JAMA studies, the American Medical Association (AMA)
officially announced its support for the decriminalization of
marijuana. </p>

<p>Contrary to a 1987 television commercial sponsored by the
Partnership for a Drug-Free America (PDFA), marijuana does not
&quot;flatten&quot; brain waves either. In the commercial, a
normal human brain wave was compared to what was supposedly the
(much flatter) brain wave of a 14-year-old high on marijuana. It
was actually the brain wave of a coma patient [2]. PDFA lied
about the data, and had to pull the commercial off of the air
when researchers complained to the television networks [62, p.
74]. </p>

<p>In reality, marijuana has the effect of slightly increasing
alpha-wave activity. Alpha waves are generally associated with
meditative and relaxed states which are, in turn, often
associated with human creativity [13]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Memory
</h4>

<p>Marijuana does impair short-term memory, but only during
intoxication. Although the authoritative studies on marijuana use
seem to agree that there is no residual impairment following
intoxication [5, 6, 13], persistent impairment of short-term
memory has been noted in chronic marijuana smokers up to 6 and 12
weeks following abstinence [70]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Heart
Problems </h4>

<p>It is accepted in medical circles today that marijuana use
causes no evident long-term cardiovascular problems for normal
persons. However, marijuana-smoking does cause changes in the
heart and body's circulation characteristic of stress, which may
complicate preexisting cardiovascular problems like hypertension,
cerebrovascular disease, and coronary atherosclerosis [5, p. 72].
Marijuana's effects upon blood pressure are complex and
inconsistent [5, p. 66 - 67]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Hormones
</h4>

<p>Chronic marijuana use has not been found to alter testosterone
or other sex hormone levels, despite the conclusions of Dr. R.C.
Kolodony's 1974 study. Seven similar studies have been performed
since then, the most recent by a Dr. Robert Block at the
University of Iowa [14], and none have reproduced Kolodony's
results. In contrast, heavy alcohol use is known to lower these
same testosterone levels [65]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Reproductive
Damage </h4>

<p>No trustworthy study has ever shown that marijuana use damages
the reproductive system, or causes chromosome breakage. Dr.
Gabriel Nahas reached the opposite conclusion in his experiments
performed in the early 1980s, but did so in part using the in
vitro (i.e., in test tubes and petrii dishes) cells of rhesus
monkeys. His rather unjustified claim that these changes would
also occur in human bodies in vivo (in the body) was criticized
by his colleagues and, in 1983, he renounced his own results. </p>

<p>Studies of actual human populations have failed to demonstrate
that marijuana adversely affects the reproductive system [61, 5].
Wu et al. found in 1988 a correlation between marijuana use and
low sperm counts in human males. But this is misleading because
(1) a decrease in sperm count has not been shown to have a
negative effect on fertility, and (2) the sperm count returned to
normal levels after marijuana use had ceased [5]. </p>

<p>Claims that marijuana use may impair hormone production,
menstrual cycles, or fertility in females are both unproven and
unfounded [43]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">The
Immune System </h4>

<p>Studies in which lab rats were injected with extremely large
quantities of THC have found that marijuana (in such
unrealistically huge quantities) does have an
&quot;immunosuppressive effect&quot; in those lab rats, in that
it temporarily shuts off certain cells in the liver called
lymphocytes and macrophages. These macrophages are useful in
fighting off bacterial, not viral, infections. But this is only
for the duration of intoxication [46]. There also exists some
evidence that marijuana metabolites stay in the lungs for up to
seven months after smoking has ceased, possibly affecting the
immune system of the lungs (but not by turning the cells off)
[47]. This said, doctors and researchers are still not sure that
the immune system is actually negatively affected in realistic
situations since there are no numbers to support the idea [15].
In fact, three studies showed that THC may have actually
stimulated the immune system in the people studied [16, 17, 18]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Birth
Defects </h4>

<p>Unlike alcohol, cocaine, and tobacco, studies show that there
exists no evident link between prenatal use of marijuana and
birth defects [5, p. 99] or fetal alcohol syndrome [72] in
humans. In fact, marijuana use during the third trimester has
been found to have a positive impact on birthweight [73]. It is
known that Delta-9-THC does enter the placenta [45], so mothers
are advised against consuming large quantities. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Cancer
</h4>

<p>Smoking marijuana has the potential to cause both bronchitis
and cancer of the lungs, throat, and neck, but this is generally
no different than inhaling any other burnt carbon-containing
matter since they all increase the number of lesions (and
therefore possible infections) in your airways. There are a
couple of studies that claim on the basis of carcinogens that
smoking marijuana is worse for your body than smoking a cigarette
[44], but these are rather simplified. There are actually some
very convincing reasons to believe that smoking cigarettes is
relatively more dangerous to the body than smoking marijuana on
more than one count: (1) It is accepted by a growing number of
scientists today that all American cigarettes contain significant
levels of polonium-210 [22], the same sort of radiation given off
by the plutonium of atom bombs (ionizing alpha radiation). It
just so happens that the tobacco plant's roots and leaves are
especially good at absorbing radioactive elements from
uranium-containing phosphate fertilizers that are required by
U.S. law, and from naturally occurring radiation in the soil,
air, and water [48]. It is the opinion of C. Everette Koop that
this radioactivity, not tar, accounts for at least 90% of all
smoking-related lung cancer [29]. Other estimates that have been
made are, about 50% according to Dr. Joseph R. DiFranza of the
Univ. of Mass. Medical Center [48] and according to Dr. Edward
Martell, a radiochemist with the National Center for Atmospheric
Research, 95% [35]. Dr. R.T. Ravenholt, former director of World
Health Surveys at the Centers for Disease Control, agrees with
the risk, asserting that &quot;Americans are exposed to far more
radiation from tobacco smoke than from any other source&quot;
[49]. Supporting the radioactivity notion is the finding that (a)
Relatively high levels of polonium-210 have been found in both
cigarette smoke [59] and the lungs of both smokers and nonsmokers
alike [60]; (b) Smokers of low-tar-and-nicotine cigarettes die of
lung cancer just as much as smokers of other cigarettes [39]; and
also, (c) Even the most potent carcinogen that has been found in
cigarettes, benzopyrene, is only present in quantities sufficient
to account for about 1% of the lung cancer cases that occur from
smoking[49]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Why
don't you know any of this? </h4>

<p>Because the tobacco industry is suppressing the information.
(2) Tobacco smoke is theorized to work as a kind of
&quot;magnet&quot; for airborne radioactive particles such as
radon, causing them to deposit in your lungs instead of on walls,
rugs, or draperies [48]. (3) Tobacco, unlike marijuana, contains
nicotine, which may harden arteries and cause many of the cases
of heart disease associated with tobacco use. It also breaks down
into cancer-promoting chemicals called N Nitrosamines when
burned, and perhaps even when it is inside the body [37]. (4) THC
is a bronchial dilator, which means it works like a cough drop by
opening up your lungs and therefore aiding in the clearance of
smoke and dirt. Nicotine has the exact opposite effect. (5)
Unlike the chemicals in marijuana, nicotine has a paralyzing
effect on the tiny hairs along the body's air passages. These
hairs normally work to keep foreign matter out of the lungs. This
means that carcinogenic tar from cigarette smoke is relatively
much harder to purge from your lungs than is that from marijuana.
And finally, (6) Marijuana users smoke significantly less than
cigarette smokers do because of both marijuana's psychoactive
properties (this is called &quot;auto-titration&quot;) and
nicotine's high potential for physical addiction [21]. It is
important to note that the NCTR study found no signs of lung
cancer in its autopsied rhesus monkeys who had smoked marijuana
for one year [6]. </p>

<p>Smoking cigarettes and smoking marijuana negatively affect
different areas of the body, and therefore cause different
problems. But everything considered, marijuana-only smokers who
average 3 - 4 joints per day show similar symptoms to cigarette
smokers who polish off 20 in a day [74]. Although one well-done
study tells us that frequent marijuana smokers have a 19% greater
risk of respiratory diseases than people who smoke nothing at all
[66], it seems that neck and throat cancers are much more likely
to result than lung cancer or emphysema. This is because, unlike
tobacco, marijuana does not penetrate deeply into the lung. In
order to minimize the risk of acquiring neck or throat cancer
from marijuana smoke, it is best to (1) avoid as much as possible
cigarette-smoking and heavy drinking while smoking marijuana, and
(2) eat plenty of vegetables (such as carrots, broccoli, squash,
and sprouts) or vitamin supplements of beta carotene, vitamins A,
C and E, and selenium [65]. These are believed to impede cancer's
progress. </p>

<p>In addition, there are actually things that can be done to
reduce and even entirely eliminate the bodily harm that may
potentially result from smoking marijuana. This is possible
because all of the principle psychoactive ingredients of
marijuana (THC and the cannabinoids) are neither mutagenic
(gene-mutating) nor carcinogenic (cancer-causing) [65]. </p>

<p>Legalizing marijuana would make (better) water bongs and
marijuana foods, drinks, and pills both less expensive and more
accessible. Smoking marijuana through a water-filled bong will
cool the smoke and there is reason to believe that it will filter
some of the carcinogens [69, 36]. Eating or drinking marijuana
effectively eliminates all negative effects. In addition, it is
conceivable that an aerosol contraption or vaporizer, commonly
called a tilt pipe, could easily be constructed that would
surpass joints in efficiency, match them in onset and control of
effects, and yet would be effectively harmless to the body. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Fat
Cells </h4>

<p>One of the more ridiculous myths being circulated is that
marijuana stays in your fat cells and can keep you high for
months. Even though they may have similar names, the psychoactive
THC (Delta-9-THC) is different from the metabolites (for
instance, 11-OH-THC and 11-nor) that your body breaks it down
into in that the latter will not get you stoned. It is the
metabolites that stay in your fatty cells and show up on drug
tests. Your body is depleted of Delta-9-THC only hours after
ingestion [40, 41]. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<h3>Other MJ Myths and Realities </h3>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Amotivational
Syndrome </h4>

<p>Amotivational syndrome is defined as a condition in which a
person loses ambition or motivation to complete tasks that he
would normally like to have completed. Claims made in the 60's
that marijuana use resulted in amotivational syndrome were
predominantly founded on stereotypes. But more recently, the
carefully-designed NCTR study has actually confirmed these
suspicions under certain conditions. It found that marijuana use
may consistently produce something akin to amotivational syndrome
in adolescent monkeys. It did not however prove that marijuana
makes adolescents apathetic or depressed. A full recovery to
normal motivation levels was typically observed to occur between
two to three months following cessation of exposure. For unknown
reasons, one monkey was observed to never fully recover.
Surprisingly, the willingness to work appeared to be equally
affected in both the daily and weekend rhesus smokers in the
study [6]. Other studies have failed to prove amotivational
syndrome in adults [42], so there is much reason to believe that
this effect only occurs during adolescent use. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Marijuana
Potency </h4>

<p>Marijuana is not significantly more potent today than it has
been in the past [23]. It is generally agreed that this myth was
the result of bad data. The researchers making the claims used as
their baseline the THC content of marijuana seized by police in
the early 1970's, which had deteriorated since then because of
poor storage conditions [23]. In reality, it seems that domestic
marijuana's average potency probably doubled in the 70's with the
advent of sinsemilla, but has remained more or less constant
since then [65]. Scare tactics claiming that marijuana potency
has increased are rather irrelevant anyways since marijuana users
typically stop smoking when the desired effect is achieved (once
again, &quot;auto-titration&quot;). Contrary to one of DARE's
allegations [28], it is generally agreed that marijuana does not
create a tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, or physical dependence
in the user. Lester Grinspoon adds, &quot;there are many who
assert that there is nevertheless drug dependence because of
[marijuana's] capacity to generate psychic dependency. However it
is not at all clear that this type of dependency is essentially
any different from that which a man may develop with respect to
his trousers, his automobile, or his wife&quot; [61, p. 234]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Driving
</h4>

<p>Driving in any inebriated state is adding complication to what
already amounts to a constant life-threatening situation. That
said, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration
(NHTSA) summarized all of its studies by saying that there was
&quot;no indication that marijuana by itself was a cause of fatal
accidents,&quot; and that alcohol was by far the &quot;dominant
problem&quot; in drug-related accidents [32]. The Victorian
Institute of Forensic Pathology and Monash University's
Department of Forensic Medicine in Melbourne, Australia have
found that drivers who use cannabis are actually less likely to
cause fatal accidents than drug-free drivers, and are no more
likely than other drivers to be killed or seriously injured in
road accidents [33]. One experiment tested marijuana-intoxicated
drivers on both a closed course and on a crowded city street. It
found that the elements of driving most affected were
concentration and judgment [52]. An experiment involving a
driving simulator that tested actual driving ability according to
how many mistakes are incurred by sober, drunk, and high subjects
found that marijuana, unlike alcohol, does not significantly
affect driving ability. It was found that these results hold true
for even higher doses (within reason) and inexperienced marijuana
users. In fact, the only significant difference reported by the
stoned subjects was an altered perception of time, which
effectively made them drive relatively slower [50]. A similar
study found that marijuana additionally impairs the driver's
ability to attend to peripheral stimuli [71]. One theory
attempting to explain these surprising findings states that
marijuana users, in instances requiring seriousness, are in fact
able to willingly &quot;bring themselves down,&quot; such that
they are no longer high [51]. Studies that in the past have shown
that marjuana-intoxicated drivers cause significantly more
accidents than sober drivers are typically unreliable on one or
more of the following counts: (1) They use drug tests to
determine whether or not a person is high, and drug tests in use
only indicate use over the past 30 days; (2) Some studies have
not corrected for alcohol use, or do not provide a control group;
and (3) In many studies there were relatively more stoned drivers
killed, but it was not their fault. And when the police
&quot;culpability scores&quot; were tallied and factored in,
marijuana was generally not to blame for the accidents. It must
be emphasized however that one study shows that daily marijuana
smokers tend to have a 30% higher risk of injuries than non-users
[66]. In fact, accidents resulting from intoxication are thought
to be &quot;the number one hazard of marijuana use&quot; [67]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">The
Gateway Effect </h4>

<p>Marijuana use has not been found to act as a gateway drug to
the use of harder drugs. Studies show that when the Dutch
partially legalized marijuana in the 70's, heroin and cocaine use
substantially declined, despite a slight increase in marijuana
use [24]. If the stepping stone theory were true, use should have
gone up rather than down. In reality, it appears that marijuana
use tends to substitute for the use of relatively more dangerous
hard drugs like cocaine and heroin, rather than lead to their
use. Thus, oftentimes strict marijuana laws themselves are the
most significant factor involved in moving on to harder drugs
like cocaine. Such is the case in Nevada and Arizona, the states
toughest on marijuana use [65]. A recent study by Columbia
University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse attempts to
show, like many past studies have, that marijuana users are more
likely to use heroin or cocaine. But what the study actually does
show is that a large number of heroin or cocaine users have used
marijuana, not the reverse. What is not mentioned is that just as
many or even more had probably also drank alcohol, smoked
cigarettes, had sex, or eaten sandwiches prior to their hard drug
use. In fact, a National High School survey tells us that in
1990, 40.7% of all high school students had tried marijuana or
hashish at least once, whereas only 9.4% and 1.3% had ever used
cocaine and heroin, respectively [25]. Thus, at maximum, only 23%
of marijuana users go on to use cocaine, and only 3% go on to use
heroin. Thus, the stepping stone theory fails on even empirical
grounds. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Marijuana
and Crime </h4>

<p>DARE literature would have you believe that there exists a
strong correlation between marijuana use and juvenile and young
adult crime [28]. And a recent study attempts to present a link
between marijuana use and violence by stating that 2/3 of all
students who admit to taking a gun to school at least once had
smoked marijuana. In fact, DEA head Thomas Constantine recently
stated in a Washington Times interview that &quot;Many times
people talk about the nonviolent drug offender. That is a rare
species. There is not some sterile drug type not involved in
violence who is contributing some good to the community; that is
ridiculous. They are contributing nothing but evil.&quot; But
these allegations are unsupported by research because test
results show that changes in personality resulting from marijuana
use, even though they are not relatively significant, include
among other things a lessening of aggressive trends [34]. And
large population studies such as the La Guardia report [10] have
found that, if anything, marijuana use inhibits antisocial
activity such as violence [20]. The drug-inspired violence myth,
including a comprehensive history of its conception, is discussed
at great length in Lester Grinspoon's book, where it is shown to
be based largely on a distorted Persian story that is hundreds of
years old [61]. The problem inherent in drawing conclusions based
on correlations such as the 2/3 statistic above is that causality
cannot be inferred from correlation. In other words, there is no
way of determining whether marijuana use contributed in some way
to the existence of certain traits of marijuana users, i.e.
bringing a gun to school, or, as seems entirely more likely,
people with such traits are drawn to marijuana use. One study
found that chronic marijuana users had significantly higher WAIS
IQ scores (113.08) than both moderate users (102.15) and nonusers
(103.26) [30]. It is simply impossible to make sense of such
statistics as presented. </p>

<h1>DRUG LEGALIZATION DEBATES </h1>

<p><b>Part 2 - About 15 pages</b> </p>

<p><b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p>The following pages are actual excerpts from some of my
debates on drug policy. </p>

<p>The person I am debating in many of these questions is an M.D.
with about 25 years experience in medicine. You can see how he
started out from the first paragraph. He wound up agreeing with
me and posted a message telling everyone he had changed his mind
and supported a plan similar to the plan used in Liverpool. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>I SAID: Research done at the Federal hospital at Lexington,
KY, was unable to establish what a lethal dose of heroin might
be. In addition, the doctors in Liverpool who prescribe heroin to
addicts every day state that &quot;heroin is not a dangerous
drug&quot; and they have some patients on massive doses of heroin
with no risk of overdose. </p>

<p>{{ Cliff, you must stop this dangerous garbage before you kill
someone. Opiates cause the suppression of respiration. </p>

<p>You quietly stop breathing and die. The LD50 (dose required to
kill half the population of a test animal) of the various opiates
has been well worked out. Specific opiate antagonists such as
naloxone can and are LIFE-SAVING in opiate overdose cases.
Naloxone does nothing but antagonize the respiratory effects of
opiates.}} </p>

<p>You had better talk to the doctors listed in Signer.zip
because they are the ones who told me, as well as the doctors in
Liverpool who prescribe it. They announced it on 60 Minutes so
they reached far more people than I ever will. The people who
told me are -- without doubt -- the leading authorities in the
world on the subject. One of them, in fact, has headed up
California's official investigation into the subject for the last
25 years. There have been other doctors on these boards who have
already recognized that the credentials of the people I am
referring to were far superior to their own. If you would like to
compare credentials, I will list theirs. </p>

<p>Of course, even if heroin was a significant health hazard,
that still would not mean that prison was a productive approach
to the problem. Every major study said that it was precisely
because of these dangers that we should not take this approach --
because this policy only made things worse. </p>

<p>{{ It is true that habitual users become resistant to these
effects, but, for God's sake believe me when I say that a naive
user is in mortal danger from the same dose of heroin.}} </p>

<p>Naive users can be in mortal danger from a lot of things,
including alcohol, automobiles, and firearms. I can't begin to
imagine all the things that we might have to protect you from.
That does not mean it is a good idea to throw them in prison, or
you either, even if you did succumb to the temptations of heroin.
</p>

<p>{{Please give us the words actually used the doctors by the
doctors you are quoting above. If you want to be believed, back
up your opinions WITH QUOTES.}} </p>

<p>Dr. Benson Rowe stated that heroin was &quot;harmless&quot;.
Present in the room at the same time, and voicing no protest were
Dr. Frederick H. Meyers, Dr. Herbert Berger, and the others
listed in Signer.zip. You may look them up in Who's Who. Also,
the doctors in Liverpool stated on 60 Minutes that &quot;Heroin
is not a dangerous drug.&quot; They ought to know because they
prescribe it every day. The full transcript of the program is in
Hoover.zip. </p>

<p>{{ The reason, of course, that you cant is that these notions
fly in the very face of modern neuro-pharmacology.}} </p>

<p>As I said, I will be glad to compare the credentials of these
people with anyone you would like to name. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>The following message is from David C. I thought it was
particularly good. </p>

<p>PMFJI, </p>

<p><b>{{Drugs are illegal because using them is very bad for
people, and therefore very bad for the country.}}</b> </p>

<p>Either I missed something and you finally made tobacco and
alcohol illegal in America or you are saying that tobacco and
alcohol are not drugs or you are saying that using tobacco or
alcohol is not very bad for people. I don't think there are any
other possibilities. Either way this would seem to be a very
silly thing to say. </p>

<p>Let me inject some statistics into your debate: </p>

Looks to me like we both have a serious drug problem - and that
it is the probable cause of some crimes. Also looks like you
wouldn't really want to stuff too many more Americans in jail -
its obviously not working. Australia generaly follows the
American model RE: Drug law, although minor offenders are treated
much more leniently (ie users). </p>

<p>Looking at the statistics would lead one to think that some of
the programmes that continental Europe have for limitting drug
use might be worthwhile. &quot;Liberal&quot; or not, if they work
they would be better than whatever it is we are doing now. I
think your society and mine are obfuscating their moral duty in
the treatment of drug offenders if we continues to simply lock
them up. And, it would seem, wasting a lot of money. </p>

<p>I assume you have never been inside a prison? The probability
of meeting death in a prison is much higher than outside of it.
Prohibition of alcohol didn't work very well early this century.
I don't think that the track record of prohibition of drugs is
doing very well either. </p>

<p>I am told that over half the population of Australia has
smoked marijuana (no source). Should we just build a prison wall
around the place and lock the lot up?? </p>

<p>Regards </p>

<p>David C. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p><b>{{How many people would I imprison to stop the flow of
these drugs? Enough to save the rest. Or, if you can come up with
another alternative that would stop the widespread destruction
caused by drug abuse, I would throw out the prison idea, and go
with that. }}</b> </p>

<p>Thirty million people in prison? What an idea! First, face the
fact that there is no way in Hell that we can afford to throw
enough people in prison to make this policy effective. You might
as well go out and throw rocks at the moon and claim that you are
getting closer every time. We can't do it even if it was a good
idea. </p>

<p>So, it looks like the first thing we ought to do is look for
Option #2. Any suggestions? </p>

<p><b>{{You see the horrors of putting drug abusers in prison. I
see the horrors of drug abuse period.}}</b> </p>

<p>Every major study of drug policy agreed that prison only
increased the existing dangers of drugs, and made the situation
worse. In the case of drugs like heroin, they said that nearly
all of the damage to the individual health and to society was the
result of the fact that the drugs were illegal and therefore
unregulated. </p>

<p><b>{{Consider the possibility that continued vigorous
prosecution of the drug laws may limit FUTURE incarcerations in
the long term.}} </b></p>

<p>So how many millions should we put in prison right now? </p>

<p><b>{{ In the meantime I'm comfortable leaving the question in
the hands of our elected representatives.}}</b> </p>

<p>Certainly any change in the laws will have to come from them.
But tell me, where do you agree or disagree with the conclusions
presented by the CU Report, and why? </p>

<p><b>{{ for God's sake, you gave a reference. If discourse is to
mean anything, you must be prepared to back up the reference.}} </b></p>

<p>It would be nice if you did the same, or maybe just answered
some of the simple questions I have asked. Like: who is Dr.
William Halsted and how does his story relate to what you said
earlier? </p>

<p>I am beginning to believe you have not read the CU Report or
you would know the answer to this one right off the top of your
head. </p>

<p><b>{{ }} Dr. Benson Rowe stated that heroin was
&quot;harmless&quot;. {{ The full quote, in context, please.}}</b>
</p>

<p>The occasion was the signing of the Hoover Resolution at the
Hoover Institute at Stanford. Present in the room were the people
listed in Signer.zip, as I said. Dr. Benson Rowe is Professor
Emeritus of Cardiac Surgery at the University of California at
San Francisco. In introducing himself to the assembled group, he
explained how he became interested in the drug issue. He said it
was immediately after World War II when he began doing surgery on
some addicts with damaged heart valves. In order to find out what
was damaging their heart valves he went to the county coroner and
researched the issue with the bodies of people who had died. He
discovered, much to his surprise, that the coroner and every
other medical authority agreed that heroin was not the cause of
the injury to the heart valves. The cause of the injury, instead
was the impurities in the street drug, and the infections which
resulted from injecting anything in unsanitary conditions. He
said that, after almost fifty years of research on the subject,
he was convinced that, except for the fact that heroin caused
addiction, it was otherwise medically &quot;harmless&quot; to the
body. The other doctors in attendance nodded agreement. </p>

<p>At the same conference I asked Dr. Frederick Meyers about what
medication he would recommend for my mother's condition. He said
that opioids were the drug of choice and that they should have no
harmful effects on my mother. </p>

<p><b>{{}}Also, the doctors in Liverpool stated on 60 Minutes
that &quot;Heroin is not a dangerous drug.&quot;{{{ The full
quote, in context, please.}}</b> </p>

<p>See below. The show aired December 28, 1993. Ed is Ed Bradley.
Julia is an addict. Alan Perry is a counselor at the clinic. As I
said, the full text is in Hoover.zip which you could have looked
up and read yourself. </p>

<p>Ed: Julia says she's now able to have normal relation, to hold
down a job as a waitress and to care for her 3 year old daughter.
Without the prescription, where do you think you would be? </p>

<p>Julia: I would probably be dead now. </p>

<p>Ed: Once, they have gotten their prescriptions, addicts must
show up for regular meetings to show that they are staying
healthy and free from crime. But how can anyone be healthy if
they are taking a drug like heroin? </p>

<p>Alan Perry: Pure heroin is not a dangerous drug. We have
people on massive doses of heroin. </p>

<p>Ed: Alan Perry is a former Drug Information Officer for the
local Health Authority and now a counselor at the clinic. So how
come we see so much damage caused by heroin? </p>

<p>Alan: The heroin that is causing that damage, is not causing
damage because of the heroin in it, it is causing damage because
of the bread dust, coffee, crushed bleach crystals, anything that
causes the harm and if heroin is 90% adulterated that means only
10% is heroin, the rest is rubbish, and if you inject cement into
your veins, you don't have to be a medical expert to work it out,
that's going to cause harm. </p>

<p>Ed: Many at the clinic like George still suffer from the
damage caused by street drugs. Alan Perry believes you can't
prescribe clean drugs and needles to addicts without teaching
them how to use them. </p>

<p>Alan: You know the major causes of ill health to drug
injectors is not even the dirty drugs they take, it is their bad
technique. Not knowing how to do it. In America I have seen
addicts missing legs and arms and that is through bad technique.
So we show people how to, not how to inject safely, but how to
inject less dangerously. We have to be clear about that, you have
stoned people sticking needles in themselves in a dangerous
activity. The strategy is called &quot;harm minimalization.&quot;
</p>

<p><b>{{There is a program in Oakland, Calif. When a drug abuser
comes in, and is convicted of a felony charge, he has the
possibility of a new program. . . .}}</b> </p>

<p>You seem to miss the point of these programs. These programs
came about as a result of recognition that prison does not work.
The point of these drug courts is to do anything they can to keep
people out of prison. </p>

<p><b>{{But good news! Did you watch NBC news tonight? If so, you
saw the description of a drug program in Oakland. See my post to
David C. for a quickie description. It keeps drugs illegal, and
keeps many users out of prison, and sobers them up. Wow. }}</b> </p>

<p>You should have caught the A&amp;E special about what is
happening in Europe. They featured the Chief of Police of Oakland
and the Sheriff of San Francisco both saying that the drug war
should be abandoned because it is absolutely hopeless. You
probably missed the news that the mayors of San Francisco,
Oakland, and San Jose held a press conference (along with their
respective law enforcment officials) to announce their signing of
the Hoover Resolution. </p>

<p><b>{{But there was even more good news with it. A man was
quoted who was trying to sell the program. He pointed out that it
saved a whole lot of money. Said it costs $20,000 a year to keep
a druggie in prison. So, unless the average amount of time served
for a drug offense is 23 years, your figure of $450,000 is way
high. }}</b> </p>

<p>The $450,000 figure is composed of the following: $150,000 for
arrest and prosecution, according to figures compiled by the
State of New York. About $150,000 for a prison cell, which is
what it costs here in California. In New York this figure is a
little lower - but still over $100,000. Then add about $30,000
per year for an average term of five years. Total: about $450,000
</p>

<p><b>{{Also, Mr C. pointed out the number of prisoners per
100,000 in this country. It 426, which comes to a little over
1,000,000 altogether. So Cliff's figure of 1,000,000 now in
prison on drug charges must have also been a bit off. (Maybe he
used it like the figure for black males - there are 1,000,000 in
prison, and some of them are there on drug charges.)}}</b> </p>

<p>As earlier, you are misstating what I said. Let me try it
again. There are currently about 1.4 million people in the
prisons and jails of the US and the population is rising rapidly,
primarily because of drugs. The 1.4 million figure is the
population in the prisons on a given census day, which means the
actual count of people who went through those prisons is higher
than that figure. By the Federal Government's own estimates, we
will soon reach the points where we have more than 1.5 million
people in prison (on a given census day) and about two- thirds of
those people will be there for drug charges. The full figures, if
you care to read them, are available in the Sourcebook of
Criminal Justice Statistics, published by the DOJ and available
at your local Government book store or through your local
library. </p>

<p><b>{{Drugs are illegal because using them is very bad for
people, and therefore very bad for the country. }}</b> </p>

<p>Absolutely false. That never was the reason for the laws. </p>

<p><b>{{ It is far to our benefit to have a nation of sober
people. }}</b> </p>

<p>No doubt about that, but prison does not achieve that very
well. </p>

<p><b>{{It merely depends on what you want to discourage. Using
drugs is a behavior which is subject to negative reinforcement.}}
</b></p>

<p>The average drug user never sees any such negative
reinforcement from the criminal justice system, except perhaps
that it makes their drugs cost a little more. If that is your
object, you should face the fact right now that this is a
failure. </p>

<p><b>{{How, then, would you persuade them to seek treatment?}}</b>
</p>

<p>My good friend Judge James P. Gray says he does it all the
time with people with alcohol problems, without threatening them
with prison. </p>

<p><b>{{Well, yes, &quot;separation from society&quot; now means
prison. You have some other alternative?}}</b> </p>

<p>So answer the question: How many millions of people do you
think we ought to put in prison for drugs? </p>

<p><b>{{Once again, the British experiment with prescription
heroin has been a failure: &quot;The prescription of
pharmaceutically pure heroin in controlled doses is, in most
essential respects, a thing of the past in Britain.&quot;
(&quot;Drug Problems and Criminal Justice Policy in
Britain,&quot; _Contemporary Drug Problems_, Summer 1992)}}</b> </p>

<p>My good friend, Dr. Clarke Smith, a member of the California
Academy of Family Practice just got back from there last week and
reported that heroin and cocaine are CURRENTLY being prescribed
and that the authorities consider it quite successful. The 60
Minutes show on this subject aired on December 28, 1993, and we
have personally confirmed the facts with the British doctors on
several occasions. The doctors say that their biggest problem
with the program is that the United States Government keeps lying
about it. </p>

<p><b>}}prison as rehabilitation is a disproven illusion</b> </p>

<p><b>According to who?}}</b> </p>

<p>According to Thomas Coughlin, the New York State Commissioner
of Corrections, for one. </p>

<p><b>{{Work-release programs are already a standard part of the
prison system in many states, and have been for many years.}}</b>
</p>

<p>Most convicts do not have the opportunity to participate in
any such programs. These programs have been virtually
discontinued in California. </p>

<p><b>{{ Once again, what you saw that 15-minute television
episode doesn't prove a thing. What may have occurred (according
to Ed Bradley) in one clinic in Liverpool does not allow one to
generalize to the entire society. Anyone can create a
&quot;successful&quot; heroin maintenance program by taking the
addicts who are stable anyway and putting them in the program.
That is, if there are 500 addicts and 20 or 30 of them are
stable, then when you put the 20 or 30 stable addicts in a
maintenance program, you can claim a big &quot;success,&quot; but
you haven't really accomplished anything. Britain has been
practicing heroin maintenance since 1926, according to
&quot;Contemporary Drug Problems,&quot; and very few physicians
prescribe it anymore. If you want to impress anyone with the
supposed successs of the Liverpool program, you will have to come
up with something better than a TV report. I have been to the
library and researched the issue; if you want to continue the
debate, so should you.}}</b> </p>

<p>The more I think about this message, the more I see someone
who is in serious denial here. I have told you of the 60 Minutes
show, the A&amp;E one hour show (originally produced by the BBC),
and the fact that we have personally contacted the doctors
involved to confirm that both shows were accurate. As I said, a
group -- headed by Dr. Clarke Smith, a member of the Board of
Directors of the California Academy of Family Physicians, went to
Europe to confirm what is happening in several areas. The doctors
confirmed to us that the shows were accurate and your information
is, shall we say, outdated. Decriminalization and even outright
legalization are being called for by both medical and police
authorities all over Europe. As far as research goes, you can
download Signer.zip in library 13 of the Issues forum and start
contacting some of the doctors listed there. If you want to know
who they are in more detail, look them up in Who's Who, also at
your local library. </p>

<p>If you have researched this so well in the library, why
haven't you read any of the studies I mentioned? </p>

<p>So I am calling your bluff again. The doctors involved in
Liverpool are named in the text of the 60 Minutes program in
Hoover.zip. They are listed with information in Liverpool, or you
can simply call the public health service in Liverpool, as we
originally did, and ask to be put in touch with the doctors
running the program. Go ahead. Call them and tell us the results.
And while you are at it, remember to ask them about the vote of
the British chiefs of police. </p>

<p><b>{{ The Chinese are biologically the same as the Americans.
They react to addictive substances the same as we do.}} </b></p>

<p>Aren't the Europeans biologically the same as us, too?
Therefore, the programs which are currently working in Europe
should work here. </p>

<p><b>{{ Try reading what I wrote before you comment on it:
&quot;People who had boring or stressful jobs turned to opium:
court eunuchs, wealthy housewives, harried clerks, soldiers going
into combat, students preparing for exams.&quot; These people
have their counterparts in America.}}</b> </p>

<p>Court eunuchs have their counterpart in America? Other studies
of the same period of time showed that opium use in China was not
a lot different from alcohol use in the US. That is, the majority
of the users were weekend recreational users who could take it or
leave it. The percentage who appeared to be addicted was not much
different than the percentage one would expect from alcohol. </p>

<p>And, since you seem to be so good at history, you ought to
know that the first anti-opium laws in the US had nothing to do
with public health and safety. The first anti-opium law was an
1875 San Francisco ordinance banning the smoking of opium in
opium dens, a peculiarly Chinese custom. The stated reason for
the law was the fear that Chinese men were luring white women to
their &quot;ruin&quot; in opium dens. &quot;Ruin&quot; was
defined not as opium addiction, but as associating with Chinese
men. The racism behind these laws was overt from the very
beginning. At the same time, opium remained available in all
sorts of medicinal preparations, more commonly used by whites. </p>

<p><b>{{ Again, you should read what I wrote. During the period
of legal narcotics trade, between 1858 and 1906, the incidence of
narcotics use increased from around 5% of the population to
approximately 25%.}}</b> </p>

<p>And it was on a steady decline from 1906 to 1914 when the
Harrison Narcotics Act was passed, primarily because of the Pure
Food and Drug Act of 1905 which made manufacturers list the
ingredients and therefore allowed consumers to intelligently
choose. You may also recall that the major medical societies all
stated that the Harrison Act was a medical, criminal, and social
disaster and urged its repeal. After the passage of the Act, the
problems of drug use rose sharply. </p>

<p>And, maybe you could share with us the reasons why hemp -- the
largest crop in America -- was made illegal? </p>

<p><b>{{ Great idea, only what is more positively reinforcing
than a heroin rush?}}</b> </p>

<p>Well, most people I know think that the mundane old stuff like
making an honest living, and being sober enough to enjoy your
family is a whole lot better than any drug high. </p>

<p><b>{{ &quot;Drug users referred to treatment by the criminal
justice system stay in treatment longer on average than those
with no legal involvement, and length of time spent in treatment
is an important predictor of success. . . . Clients monitored
through TASC are as successful in reducing their drug use and
criminal activity as are those voluntarily in drug
treatment.&quot; _Bureau of Justice Statistics National Report_
(1992).}}</b> </p>

<p>That's easy to do if you are behind bars for twenty years. And
the ones that went to prison are &quot;as successful&quot; as the
ones who went voluntarily. Because it is so expensive to process
them through prison, don't you think it would be a better idea to
get them to go voluntarily? </p>

<p><b>{{ I don't see what this has to do with drug offenses.
Since you are unaware of the fact, I should explain that most
drug offenses are non- violent.}}</b> </p>

<p>The only people who seem to be unaware of this fact are the
drug warriors. </p>

<p><b>{{Fine, then I can assume that you won't mind sitting in
the passenger seat.}}</b> </p>

<p>The stats show quite clearly that illegal drugs are a
relatively minor problem on the road. </p>

<p>{{}}Heroin is a very safe drug when legal.{{ </p>

<p>Just sprinkle a little on your breakfeast cereal? Or a Bring
Your Own Balloon (BYOB) Christmas party? We'll invite your
children over, after all it's safe. Come on, you can't really
believe this. }} </p>

<p>That is the word of the world's leading medical experts on the
subject, including the doctors in Liverpool who prescribe it
every day. There is a long list of them in Signer.zip. If you
need more information on them you can read Who's Who or I can
probably put you in touch with a good number of them. (I have
offered that before but you seem strangely reluctant to try to
reply to any of my messages.) </p>

<p><b>{{}} Pot is safer than alcohol or tobacco, and has never
caused a documented human death according to all the
literature.{{</b> </p>

<p>Except when you're flying planes, trains or automobiles.}} </p>

<p>Even then, accidents caused by pot are pretty rare. For
example, a study of OSHA statistics showed that about .014% of
on=the-job accidents were caused by illegal drugs. </p>

<p><b>{{How many millions in this country drink? Are you willing
to live with a similar abuse rate for drugs like cocain, heroin,
pot and speed?}}</b> </p>

<p>Gosh no, but why aren't we doing the same thing for alcohol
and tobacco if it is such a good idea? If prison is the best way
to keep people from becoming addicted to drugs, why aren't we
jailing wine drinkers and cigarette smokers? </p>

<p><b>{{Were it not so embedded in our culture, I would might be
inclined to say yes. Until then, I'll settle for mandatory death
sentences for manslaughter cases related to alcohol abuse,
mandatory prison terms for those selling to minors, and so on. }}
</b></p>

<p>Let's suppose you got your fondest wish. Let's suppose that
tomorrow morning, you woke up as President and found outside your
home, every drug dealer in America lined up with a bag of dope in
one hand and a signed confession in the other? What would you do?
</p>

<p><b>{{How many more children are you willing to hand over to
lives of dependency, isolation and neglect? }}</b> </p>

<p>Not one -- which is one the main reasons that the current
policy ought to be stopped -- because it is devastating the
children in the black community. </p>

<p><b>{{ Gosh, a serious question! It's been *so* long!}}</b> </p>

<p>I have asked you lots of serious questions but you don't want
to answer them. So here is an old one, slightly rephrased: Let's
suppose I believe everything you say about drugs and the best
kind of drug program. You say that prison must be an integral
part of that program. So, as a taxpayer who has to pay for the
prisons, I ask you: There are thirty million drug users in the
United States. How many millions do you want to throw in prison? </p>

<p>Further supposing I believe everything you say: If prison is
such a good idea for these drugs, why isn't it an equally good
(or even better!) idea for alcohol and tobacco? </p>

<p><b>{{ The failure of our present program is that it treats
dealers as criminals and addicts as victims.}}</b> </p>

<p>No, as the judges and other law enforcement officials have
told me, it is a disaster (not just a failure) because it never
was a good idea in the first place. </p>

<p><b>{{ This is a rather arbitrary distinction, since most
dealers are also addicts and most addicts are involved in
crime.}}</b> </p>

<p>Under the law all users are dealers. </p>

<p><b>{{ Also, it is also useless trying to suppress drug dealing
without suppressing drug abuse. Therefore, I believe that a
successful drug policy should place greater weight on curtailing
drug abuse.}}</b> </p>

<p>We agree there. </p>

<p><b>{{ Drug abuse occurs for a number of reasons. People who
are poor and uneducated turn to drugs because they have nothing
better to do with their lives. Unfortunately, you can't do much
about that, short of a general reform of American society. It is
important, however, that treatment programs offer addicts an
alternative lifestyle. Taking someone out of a rotten, no-future
life in a miserable slum and putting them in treatment is
useless, if they can only go back to a rotten, no- future life in
a miserable slum.}}</b> </p>

<p>We agree there. </p>

<p><b>{{ In this light, vocational training is very important. It
is important that training be suited to the individual and also
provide him with the opportunity for pursuing a meaningful
career. But in all cases, it should be made plain that the
alternative to honest work is prison.}}</b> </p>

<p>We agree that vocational training is very important. </p>

<p>Well, we don't have any programs funded to meet the
&quot;honest work&quot; part of it so the alternative is always
prison. Of course, once they go to prison, it doesn't matter if
they get vocational training or not, because nobody is going to
hire them anyway. As a society, that is called shooting ourselves
in the foot. </p>

<p><b>{{ A lot of affluent people, who have plenty other
opportunities, also use narcotics. For such individuals, the
stigma of going to jail is very important, and so punishment is a
strong deterrent.}}</b> </p>

<p>Poor people get jail. Affluent people get the Betty Ford
Clinic. That disparity in the outcome of this policy is one of
the reasons that every major study of drug policy has recommended
decriminalization. </p>

<p><b>{{ The MADD movement provides a good model of how effective
legislation can produce a real social change: There is now a
strong stigma against drunk driving, and so the offense has
declined. Legalized gambling provides a counter-example: There is
no stigma against playing Lotto or video poker, and so millions
of people gamble who never did it before.}} </b></p>

<p>Your analogies are weak. Drunk driving is a public behavior.
There is a useful purpose to enforcing laws on public behavior
and, because the behavior is public, the laws have a chance to
confront the offender and stop the situation. The same is not
true with drug use. </p>

<p><b>{{ So, treatment and punishment are both important for
controlling the drug problem. }}</b> </p>

<p>The information supplied above does not support this
conclusion. </p>

<p><b>{{ One often hears the argument, however, that we should
treat addicts *instead* of throwing them in jail. However, these
are not logical alternatives. Many addicts will not accept
treatment unless they are already in jail or are threatened with
imprisonment.}}</b> </p>

<p>The Rand Corporation recently issued a study which said that
every dollar spent on drug treatment saved an additional seven
dollars in related social costs. On the other hand, every dollar
spent on putting drug users in prison costs about an additional
fifteen dollars in related social costs. </p>

<p>Of course, the British have a way of getting addicts to accept
treatment and become crime-free. They simply tell the addicts
that they will lose their legal prescription if they don't
straighten their lives out. It works a whole lot better than what
you are recommending. </p>

<p><b>{{ Judges often do sentence minor drug offenders to
treatment rather than prison. This has merit; we definitely need
to expand drug treatment and make it more available.}}</b> </p>

<p>We agree on this point. I would also point out that judges
often sentence minor offenders to unconscionable prison terms
over trivial offenses, like the young woman who got a mandatory
minimum of ten years without even touching drugs. </p>

<p><b>{{ But we also need to end the cycle by which addicts go
into treatment, then relapse. }}</b> </p>

<p>You missed the 60 Minutes show and the A&amp;E show on
Liverpool (obviously) so you might be interested in what the
doctors there said. They said that all modes of treatment or
punishment for drug use that they could find produced the same
essential result. That is, about five percent of the addicts per
year would come off of drugs by themselves, regardless of what
you did. They said it seemed to be as much a process of
maturation as anything else. Therefore, they said, rather than
punish them and seriously impact their health with dirty heroin,
dirty needles, etc., they opted to give the addicts prescriptions
for heroin and cocaine, and teach them how to manage their
addiction until they can mature off of it. As a result, most of
the health problems have been eliminated, most of the crime has
been eliminated, and most addicts are employed and living with
their families. </p>

<p><b>{{ For this reason, I would support a program of
accelerated minimum sentences for second and subsequent offenses.
When an addict proves untreatable, the next best alternative is
to separate him from society. In addition, the accelerated
schedule of punishments provides incentive to reform.}}</b> </p>

<p>So I ask again. How many people do you propose to put in
prison? </p>

<p><b>{{ The aim of treatment programs is to end addiction. }} </b></p>

<p>The primary aim of the British program is to keep addicts
healthy long enough to end the addiction. </p>

<p><b>{{ But it is also important to prevent untreated addicts
from becoming a menace to society. }}</b> </p>

<p>Their crimes are primarily property crimes and are a result of
the fact that drugs are illegal. In Liverpool, where they have
tried another approach, the addicts are no longer a menace to
society. </p>

<p><b>{{In this light, methadone programs have been very
successful. While methadone is addictive, it can be taken orally
and is much more long- lasting in preventing withdrawal than is
heroin.}}</b> </p>

<p>Many famous medical experts, such as Dr. Frederick H. Meyers
point out that the prescription of methadone (a narcotic) in such
large amounts proves that narcotics are not inherently dangerous.
</p>

<p><b>{{ A heroin addict needs an injection every few hours and
often becomes violent if he doesn't get it. }}</b> </p>

<p>A recent report by the Department of Justice titled
&quot;Drugs and Violence&quot; says that the only drug which has
any real connection to any kind of violent crime is alcohol. Even
if what you said was true, it would seem that we would be far
better off with an approach like they are using in Liverpool. A
managed daily prescription would seem to be the best way to
insure that this does not happen. If you had read any of the
studies I have mentioned, you would know that tobacco and alcohol
users exhibit the same kinds of anti-social behavior when they
are deprived of their drug. </p>

<p><b>{{ Finally, I would support expanded drug testing. At
present, the police are well equipped to test drunk drivers, but
narcotics users may evade punishment, unless they happen to have
the drugs in their possession. Definitely, police stations should
be equipped to test persons arrested for reckless driving and
similar offenses for drugs. Regular drug testing should also be a
part of all prison programs.}}</b> </p>

<p>Why wouldn't you support the same thing for alcohol and
tobacco? They do far more damage than illegal drugs so we would
be far better off to put the same effort against them. How about
it? Should we throw George Burns in jail because he refuses to
give up cigars? </p>

<p>And do you want to punish people based solely on their drug
tests? After all, you have money in your pocket right now with
cocaine dust on it and it is possible that enough of it got in to
your system to make you register positive. That is, of course, if
you didn't already test positive because you took a cold
medication, or a headache pill, or a cough syrup, or ate certain
kinds of bread, etc., etc., etc., <br>

<h1>DRUG LEGALIZATION DEBATES </h1>

<p><b>Part 2 - About 15 pages</b> </p>

<p><b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p>The following pages are actual excerpts from some of my
debates on drug policy. </p>

<p>The person I am debating in many of these questions is an M.D.
with about 25 years experience in medicine. You can see how he
started out from the first paragraph. He wound up agreeing with
me and posted a message telling everyone he had changed his mind
and supported a plan similar to the plan used in Liverpool. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>I SAID: Research done at the Federal hospital at Lexington,
KY, was unable to establish what a lethal dose of heroin might
be. In addition, the doctors in Liverpool who prescribe heroin to
addicts every day state that &quot;heroin is not a dangerous
drug&quot; and they have some patients on massive doses of heroin
with no risk of overdose. </p>

<p>{{ Cliff, you must stop this dangerous garbage before you kill
someone. Opiates cause the suppression of respiration. </p>

<p>You quietly stop breathing and die. The LD50 (dose required to
kill half the population of a test animal) of the various opiates
has been well worked out. Specific opiate antagonists such as
naloxone can and are LIFE-SAVING in opiate overdose cases.
Naloxone does nothing but antagonize the respiratory effects of
opiates.}} </p>

<p>You had better talk to the doctors listed in Signer.zip
because they are the ones who told me, as well as the doctors in
Liverpool who prescribe it. They announced it on 60 Minutes so
they reached far more people than I ever will. The people who
told me are -- without doubt -- the leading authorities in the
world on the subject. One of them, in fact, has headed up
California's official investigation into the subject for the last
25 years. There have been other doctors on these boards who have
already recognized that the credentials of the people I am
referring to were far superior to their own. If you would like to
compare credentials, I will list theirs. </p>

<p>Of course, even if heroin was a significant health hazard,
that still would not mean that prison was a productive approach
to the problem. Every major study said that it was precisely
because of these dangers that we should not take this approach --
because this policy only made things worse. </p>

<p>{{ It is true that habitual users become resistant to these
effects, but, for God's sake believe me when I say that a naive
user is in mortal danger from the same dose of heroin.}} </p>

<p>Naive users can be in mortal danger from a lot of things,
including alcohol, automobiles, and firearms. I can't begin to
imagine all the things that we might have to protect you from.
That does not mean it is a good idea to throw them in prison, or
you either, even if you did succumb to the temptations of heroin.
</p>

<p>{{Please give us the words actually used the doctors by the
doctors you are quoting above. If you want to be believed, back
up your opinions WITH QUOTES.}} </p>

<p>Dr. Benson Rowe stated that heroin was &quot;harmless&quot;.
Present in the room at the same time, and voicing no protest were
Dr. Frederick H. Meyers, Dr. Herbert Berger, and the others
listed in Signer.zip. You may look them up in Who's Who. Also,
the doctors in Liverpool stated on 60 Minutes that &quot;Heroin
is not a dangerous drug.&quot; They ought to know because they
prescribe it every day. The full transcript of the program is in
Hoover.zip. </p>

<p>{{ The reason, of course, that you cant is that these notions
fly in the very face of modern neuro-pharmacology.}} </p>

<p>As I said, I will be glad to compare the credentials of these

<p><b>{{Drugs are illegal because using them is very bad for
people, and therefore very bad for the country.}}</b> </p>

<p>Either I missed something and you finally made tobacco and
alcohol illegal in America or you are saying that tobacco and
alcohol are not drugs or you are saying that using tobacco or
alcohol is not very bad for people. I don't think there are any
other possibilities. Either way this would seem to be a very
silly thing to say. </p>

Looks to me like we both have a serious drug problem - and that
it is the probable cause of some crimes. Also looks like you
wouldn't really want to stuff too many more Americans in jail -
its obviously not working. Australia generaly follows the
American model RE: Drug law, although minor offenders are treated
much more leniently (ie users). </p>

<p>Looking at the statistics would lead one to think that some of
the programmes that continental Europe have for limitting drug
use might be worthwhile. &quot;Liberal&quot; or not, if they work
they would be better than whatever it is we are doing now. I
think your society and mine are obfuscating their moral duty in
the treatment of drug offenders if we continues to simply lock
them up. And, it would seem, wasting a lot of money. </p>

<p>I assume you have never been inside a prison? The probability
of meeting death in a prison is much higher than outside of it.
Prohibition of alcohol didn't work very well early this century.
I don't think that the track record of prohibition of drugs is
doing very well either. </p>

<p>I am told that over half the population of Australia has
smoked marijuana (no source). Should we just build a prison wall
around the place and lock the lot up?? </p>

<p><b>{{How many people would I imprison to stop the flow of

another alternative that would stop the widespread destruction

<p>Thirty million people in prison? What an idea! First, face the
fact that there is no way in Hell that we can afford to throw
enough people in prison to make this policy effective. You might
as well go out and throw rocks at the moon and claim that you are
getting closer every time. We can't do it even if it was a good
idea. </p>

<p>So, it looks like the first thing we ought to do is look for
Option #2. Any suggestions? </p>

<p><b>{{You see the horrors of putting drug abusers in prison. I
see the horrors of drug abuse period.}}</b> </p>

<p>Every major study of drug policy agreed that prison only
increased the existing dangers of drugs, and made the situation
worse. In the case of drugs like heroin, they said that nearly
all of the damage to the individual health and to society was the
result of the fact that the drugs were illegal and therefore
unregulated. </p>

<p><b>{{Consider the possibility that continued vigorous
prosecution of the drug laws may limit FUTURE incarcerations in
the long term.}} </b></p>

<p>So how many millions should we put in prison right now? </p>

<p><b>{{ In the meantime I'm comfortable leaving the question in
the hands of our elected representatives.}}</b> </p>

<p>Certainly any change in the laws will have to come from them.
But tell me, where do you agree or disagree with the conclusions
presented by the CU Report, and why? </p>

<p><b>{{ for God's sake, you gave a reference. If discourse is to
mean anything, you must be prepared to back up the reference.}} </b></p>

<p>It would be nice if you did the same, or maybe just answered
some of the simple questions I have asked. Like: who is Dr.
William Halsted and how does his story relate to what you said
earlier? </p>

<p>I am beginning to believe you have not read the CU Report or
you would know the answer to this one right off the top of your
head. </p>

<p><b>{{ }} Dr. Benson Rowe stated that heroin was
&quot;harmless&quot;. {{ The full quote, in context, please.}}</b>
</p>

<p>The occasion was the signing of the Hoover Resolution at the
Hoover Institute at Stanford. Present in the room were the people
listed in Signer.zip, as I said. Dr. Benson Rowe is Professor
Emeritus of Cardiac Surgery at the University of California at
San Francisco. In introducing himself to the assembled group, he
explained how he became interested in the drug issue. He said it
was immediately after World War II when he began doing surgery on
some addicts with damaged heart valves. In order to find out what
was damaging their heart valves he went to the county coroner and
researched the issue with the bodies of people who had died. He
discovered, much to his surprise, that the coroner and every
other medical authority agreed that heroin was not the cause of
the injury to the heart valves. The cause of the injury, instead
was the impurities in the street drug, and the infections which
resulted from injecting anything in unsanitary conditions. He
said that, after almost fifty years of research on the subject,
he was convinced that, except for the fact that heroin caused
addiction, it was otherwise medically &quot;harmless&quot; to the
body. The other doctors in attendance nodded agreement. </p>

<p>At the same conference I asked Dr. Frederick Meyers about what
medication he would recommend for my mother's condition. He said
that opioids were the drug of choice and that they should have no
harmful effects on my mother. </p>

<p><b>{{}}Also, the doctors in Liverpool stated on 60 Minutes
that &quot;Heroin is not a dangerous drug.&quot;{{{ The full
quote, in context, please.}}</b> </p>

<p>See below. The show aired December 28, 1993. Ed is Ed Bradley.
Julia is an addict. Alan Perry is a counselor at the clinic. As I
said, the full text is in Hoover.zip which you could have looked
up and read yourself. </p>

<p>Ed: Julia says she's now able to have normal relation, to hold
down a job as a waitress and to care for her 3 year old daughter.
Without the prescription, where do you think you would be? </p>

<p>Julia: I would probably be dead now. </p>

<p>Ed: Once, they have gotten their prescriptions, addicts must
show up for regular meetings to show that they are staying
healthy and free from crime. But how can anyone be healthy if
they are taking a drug like heroin? </p>

<p>Alan Perry: Pure heroin is not a dangerous drug. We have
people on massive doses of heroin. </p>

<p>Ed: Alan Perry is a former Drug Information Officer for the
local Health Authority and now a counselor at the clinic. So how
come we see so much damage caused by heroin? </p>

<p>Alan: The heroin that is causing that damage, is not causing
damage because of the heroin in it, it is causing damage because
of the bread dust, coffee, crushed bleach crystals, anything that
causes the harm and if heroin is 90% adulterated that means only
10% is heroin, the rest is rubbish, and if you inject cement into
your veins, you don't have to be a medical expert to work it out,
that's going to cause harm. </p>

<p>Ed: Many at the clinic like George still suffer from the
damage caused by street drugs. Alan Perry believes you can't
prescribe clean drugs and needles to addicts without teaching
them how to use them. </p>

<p>Alan: You know the major causes of ill health to drug
injectors is not even the dirty drugs they take, it is their bad
technique. Not knowing how to do it. In America I have seen
addicts missing legs and arms and that is through bad technique.
So we show people how to, not how to inject safely, but how to
inject less dangerously. We have to be clear about that, you have
stoned people sticking needles in themselves in a dangerous
activity. The strategy is called &quot;harm minimalization.&quot;
</p>

<p><b>{{There is a program in Oakland, Calif. When a drug abuser
comes in, and is convicted of a felony charge, he has the
possibility of a new program. . . .}}</b> </p>

<p>You seem to miss the point of these programs. These programs
came about as a result of recognition that prison does not work.
The point of these drug courts is to do anything they can to keep
people out of prison. </p>

<p><b>{{But good news! Did you watch NBC news tonight? If so, you
saw the description of a drug program in Oakland. See my post to
David C. for a quickie description. It keeps drugs illegal, and

<p>You should have caught the A&amp;E special about what is
happening in Europe. They featured the Chief of Police of Oakland
and the Sheriff of San Francisco both saying that the drug war
should be abandoned because it is absolutely hopeless. You
probably missed the news that the mayors of San Francisco,
Oakland, and San Jose held a press conference (along with their
respective law enforcment officials) to announce their signing of
the Hoover Resolution. </p>

<p><b>{{But there was even more good news with it. A man was
quoted who was trying to sell the program. He pointed out that it
saved a whole lot of money. Said it costs $20,000 a year to keep
a druggie in prison. So, unless the average amount of time served
for a drug offense is 23 years, your figure of $450,000 is way
high. }}</b> </p>

<p>The $450,000 figure is composed of the following: $150,000 for
arrest and prosecution, according to figures compiled by the
State of New York. About $150,000 for a prison cell, which is
what it costs here in California. In New York this figure is a
little lower - but still over $100,000. Then add about $30,000
per year for an average term of five years. Total: about $450,000
</p>

<p><b>{{Also, Mr C. pointed out the number of prisoners per
100,000 in this country. It 426, which comes to a little over
1,000,000 altogether. So Cliff's figure of 1,000,000 now in
prison on drug charges must have also been a bit off. (Maybe he
used it like the figure for black males - there are 1,000,000 in
prison, and some of them are there on drug charges.)}}</b> </p>

<p>As earlier, you are misstating what I said. Let me try it
again. There are currently about 1.4 million people in the
prisons and jails of the US and the population is rising rapidly,
primarily because of drugs. The 1.4 million figure is the
population in the prisons on a given census day, which means the
actual count of people who went through those prisons is higher
than that figure. By the Federal Government's own estimates, we
will soon reach the points where we have more than 1.5 million
people in prison (on a given census day) and about two- thirds of
those people will be there for drug charges. The full figures, if
you care to read them, are available in the Sourcebook of
Criminal Justice Statistics, published by the DOJ and available
at your local Government book store or through your local
library. </p>

<p><b>{{Drugs are illegal because using them is very bad for
people, and therefore very bad for the country. }}</b> </p>

<p>Absolutely false. That never was the reason for the laws. </p>

<p><b>{{ It is far to our benefit to have a nation of sober
people. }}</b> </p>

<p>No doubt about that, but prison does not achieve that very
well. </p>

<p><b>{{It merely depends on what you want to discourage. Using
drugs is a behavior which is subject to negative reinforcement.}}
</b></p>

<p>The average drug user never sees any such negative
reinforcement from the criminal justice system, except perhaps
that it makes their drugs cost a little more. If that is your
object, you should face the fact right now that this is a
failure. </p>

<p><b>{{How, then, would you persuade them to seek treatment?}}</b>
</p>

<p>My good friend Judge James P. Gray says he does it all the
time with people with alcohol problems, without threatening them
with prison. </p>

<p><b>{{Well, yes, &quot;separation from society&quot; now means
prison. You have some other alternative?}}</b> </p>

<p>So answer the question: How many millions of people do you
think we ought to put in prison for drugs? </p>

<p><b>{{Once again, the British experiment with prescription
heroin has been a failure: &quot;The prescription of

essential respects, a thing of the past in Britain.&quot;

Britain,&quot; _Contemporary Drug Problems_, Summer 1992)}}</b> </p>

<p>My good friend, Dr. Clarke Smith, a member of the California
Academy of Family Practice just got back from there last week and
reported that heroin and cocaine are CURRENTLY being prescribed
and that the authorities consider it quite successful. The 60
Minutes show on this subject aired on December 28, 1993, and we
have personally confirmed the facts with the British doctors on
several occasions. The doctors say that their biggest problem
with the program is that the United States Government keeps lying
about it. </p>

<p><b>}}prison as rehabilitation is a disproven illusion</b> </p>

<p>According to Thomas Coughlin, the New York State Commissioner
of Corrections, for one. </p>

<p><b>{{Work-release programs are already a standard part of the
prison system in many states, and have been for many years.}}</b>
</p>

<p>Most convicts do not have the opportunity to participate in
any such programs. These programs have been virtually
discontinued in California. </p>

<p><b>{{ Once again, what you saw that 15-minute television

addicts who are stable anyway and putting them in the program.
That is, if there are 500 addicts and 20 or 30 of them are
stable, then when you put the 20 or 30 stable addicts in a
maintenance program, you can claim a big &quot;success,&quot; but
you haven't really accomplished anything. Britain has been
practicing heroin maintenance since 1926, according to
&quot;Contemporary Drug Problems,&quot; and very few physicians
prescribe it anymore. If you want to impress anyone with the
supposed successs of the Liverpool program, you will have to come
up with something better than a TV report. I have been to the
library and researched the issue; if you want to continue the
debate, so should you.}}</b> </p>

<p>The more I think about this message, the more I see someone
who is in serious denial here. I have told you of the 60 Minutes
show, the A&amp;E one hour show (originally produced by the BBC),
and the fact that we have personally contacted the doctors
involved to confirm that both shows were accurate. As I said, a
group -- headed by Dr. Clarke Smith, a member of the Board of
Directors of the California Academy of Family Physicians, went to
Europe to confirm what is happening in several areas. The doctors
confirmed to us that the shows were accurate and your information
is, shall we say, outdated. Decriminalization and even outright
legalization are being called for by both medical and police
authorities all over Europe. As far as research goes, you can
download Signer.zip in library 13 of the Issues forum and start
contacting some of the doctors listed there. If you want to know
who they are in more detail, look them up in Who's Who, also at
your local library. </p>

<p>If you have researched this so well in the library, why
haven't you read any of the studies I mentioned? </p>

<p>So I am calling your bluff again. The doctors involved in
Liverpool are named in the text of the 60 Minutes program in
Hoover.zip. They are listed with information in Liverpool, or you
can simply call the public health service in Liverpool, as we
originally did, and ask to be put in touch with the doctors
running the program. Go ahead. Call them and tell us the results.
And while you are at it, remember to ask them about the vote of
the British chiefs of police. </p>

<p><b>{{ The Chinese are biologically the same as the Americans.

<p>Aren't the Europeans biologically the same as us, too?
Therefore, the programs which are currently working in Europe
should work here. </p>

<p><b>{{ Try reading what I wrote before you comment on it:
&quot;People who had boring or stressful jobs turned to opium:
court eunuchs, wealthy housewives, harried clerks, soldiers going
into combat, students preparing for exams.&quot; These people
have their counterparts in America.}}</b> </p>

<p>Court eunuchs have their counterpart in America? Other studies
of the same period of time showed that opium use in China was not
a lot different from alcohol use in the US. That is, the majority
of the users were weekend recreational users who could take it or
leave it. The percentage who appeared to be addicted was not much
different than the percentage one would expect from alcohol. </p>

<p>And, since you seem to be so good at history, you ought to
know that the first anti-opium laws in the US had nothing to do
with public health and safety. The first anti-opium law was an
1875 San Francisco ordinance banning the smoking of opium in
opium dens, a peculiarly Chinese custom. The stated reason for
the law was the fear that Chinese men were luring white women to
their &quot;ruin&quot; in opium dens. &quot;Ruin&quot; was
defined not as opium addiction, but as associating with Chinese
men. The racism behind these laws was overt from the very
beginning. At the same time, opium remained available in all
sorts of medicinal preparations, more commonly used by whites. </p>

<p><b>{{ Again, you should read what I wrote. During the period
of legal narcotics trade, between 1858 and 1906, the incidence of
narcotics use increased from around 5% of the population to
approximately 25%.}}</b> </p>

<p>And it was on a steady decline from 1906 to 1914 when the
Harrison Narcotics Act was passed, primarily because of the Pure
Food and Drug Act of 1905 which made manufacturers list the
ingredients and therefore allowed consumers to intelligently
choose. You may also recall that the major medical societies all
stated that the Harrison Act was a medical, criminal, and social
disaster and urged its repeal. After the passage of the Act, the
problems of drug use rose sharply. </p>

<p>And, maybe you could share with us the reasons why hemp -- the
largest crop in America -- was made illegal? </p>

<p><b>{{ Great idea, only what is more positively reinforcing

<p>Well, most people I know think that the mundane old stuff like
making an honest living, and being sober enough to enjoy your
family is a whole lot better than any drug high. </p>

<p><b>{{ &quot;Drug users referred to treatment by the criminal

criminal activity as are those voluntarily in drug
treatment.&quot; _Bureau of Justice Statistics National Report_
(1992).}}</b> </p>

<p>That's easy to do if you are behind bars for twenty years. And
the ones that went to prison are &quot;as successful&quot; as the
ones who went voluntarily. Because it is so expensive to process
them through prison, don't you think it would be a better idea to
get them to go voluntarily? </p>

<p><b>{{ I don't see what this has to do with drug offenses.

<p>That is the word of the world's leading medical experts on the
subject, including the doctors in Liverpool who prescribe it
every day. There is a long list of them in Signer.zip. If you

<p><b>{{ Gosh, a serious question! It's been *so* long!}}</b> </p>

<p>I have asked you lots of serious questions but you don't want
to answer them. So here is an old one, slightly rephrased: Let's
suppose I believe everything you say about drugs and the best
kind of drug program. You say that prison must be an integral
part of that program. So, as a taxpayer who has to pay for the
prisons, I ask you: There are thirty million drug users in the
United States. How many millions do you want to throw in prison? </p>

<p>Further supposing I believe everything you say: If prison is
such a good idea for these drugs, why isn't it an equally good
(or even better!) idea for alcohol and tobacco? </p>

<p><b>{{ The failure of our present program is that it treats
dealers as criminals and addicts as victims.}}</b> </p>

<p>No, as the judges and other law enforcement officials have
told me, it is a disaster (not just a failure) because it never
was a good idea in the first place. </p>

<p><b>{{ This is a rather arbitrary distinction, since most
dealers are also addicts and most addicts are involved in
crime.}}</b> </p>

<p>Under the law all users are dealers. </p>

<p><b>{{ Also, it is also useless trying to suppress drug dealing
without suppressing drug abuse. Therefore, I believe that a
successful drug policy should place greater weight on curtailing
drug abuse.}}</b> </p>

<p>We agree there. </p>

<p><b>{{ Drug abuse occurs for a number of reasons. People who
are poor and uneducated turn to drugs because they have nothing
better to do with their lives. Unfortunately, you can't do much
about that, short of a general reform of American society. It is
important, however, that treatment programs offer addicts an
alternative lifestyle. Taking someone out of a rotten, no-future
life in a miserable slum and putting them in treatment is
useless, if they can only go back to a rotten, no- future life in
a miserable slum.}}</b> </p>

<p>We agree there. </p>

<p><b>{{ In this light, vocational training is very important. It
is important that training be suited to the individual and also
provide him with the opportunity for pursuing a meaningful
career. But in all cases, it should be made plain that the
alternative to honest work is prison.}}</b> </p>

<p>We agree that vocational training is very important. </p>

<p>Well, we don't have any programs funded to meet the
&quot;honest work&quot; part of it so the alternative is always
prison. Of course, once they go to prison, it doesn't matter if
they get vocational training or not, because nobody is going to
hire them anyway. As a society, that is called shooting ourselves
in the foot. </p>

<p><b>{{ A lot of affluent people, who have plenty other
opportunities, also use narcotics. For such individuals, the
stigma of going to jail is very important, and so punishment is a
strong deterrent.}}</b> </p>

<p>Poor people get jail. Affluent people get the Betty Ford
Clinic. That disparity in the outcome of this policy is one of
the reasons that every major study of drug policy has recommended
decriminalization. </p>

<p><b>{{ The MADD movement provides a good model of how effective
legislation can produce a real social change: There is now a
strong stigma against drunk driving, and so the offense has
declined. Legalized gambling provides a counter-example: There is
no stigma against playing Lotto or video poker, and so millions
of people gamble who never did it before.}} </b></p>

<p>Your analogies are weak. Drunk driving is a public behavior.
There is a useful purpose to enforcing laws on public behavior
and, because the behavior is public, the laws have a chance to
confront the offender and stop the situation. The same is not
true with drug use. </p>

<p><b>{{ So, treatment and punishment are both important for
controlling the drug problem. }}</b> </p>

<p>The information supplied above does not support this
conclusion. </p>

<p><b>{{ One often hears the argument, however, that we should
treat addicts *instead* of throwing them in jail. However, these
are not logical alternatives. Many addicts will not accept
treatment unless they are already in jail or are threatened with
imprisonment.}}</b> </p>

<p>The Rand Corporation recently issued a study which said that
every dollar spent on drug treatment saved an additional seven
dollars in related social costs. On the other hand, every dollar
spent on putting drug users in prison costs about an additional
fifteen dollars in related social costs. </p>

<p>Of course, the British have a way of getting addicts to accept
treatment and become crime-free. They simply tell the addicts
that they will lose their legal prescription if they don't
straighten their lives out. It works a whole lot better than what
you are recommending. </p>

<p><b>{{ Judges often do sentence minor drug offenders to
treatment rather than prison. This has merit; we definitely need
to expand drug treatment and make it more available.}}</b> </p>

<p>We agree on this point. I would also point out that judges
often sentence minor offenders to unconscionable prison terms
over trivial offenses, like the young woman who got a mandatory
minimum of ten years without even touching drugs. </p>

<p><b>{{ But we also need to end the cycle by which addicts go
into treatment, then relapse. }}</b> </p>

<p>You missed the 60 Minutes show and the A&amp;E show on
Liverpool (obviously) so you might be interested in what the
doctors there said. They said that all modes of treatment or
punishment for drug use that they could find produced the same
essential result. That is, about five percent of the addicts per
year would come off of drugs by themselves, regardless of what
you did. They said it seemed to be as much a process of
maturation as anything else. Therefore, they said, rather than
punish them and seriously impact their health with dirty heroin,
dirty needles, etc., they opted to give the addicts prescriptions
for heroin and cocaine, and teach them how to manage their
addiction until they can mature off of it. As a result, most of
the health problems have been eliminated, most of the crime has
been eliminated, and most addicts are employed and living with
their families. </p>

<p><b>{{ For this reason, I would support a program of
accelerated minimum sentences for second and subsequent offenses.
When an addict proves untreatable, the next best alternative is
to separate him from society. In addition, the accelerated
schedule of punishments provides incentive to reform.}}</b> </p>

<p>So I ask again. How many people do you propose to put in
prison? </p>

<p><b>{{ The aim of treatment programs is to end addiction. }} </b></p>

<p>The primary aim of the British program is to keep addicts
healthy long enough to end the addiction. </p>

<p><b>{{ But it is also important to prevent untreated addicts
from becoming a menace to society. }}</b> </p>

<p>Their crimes are primarily property crimes and are a result of
the fact that drugs are illegal. In Liverpool, where they have
tried another approach, the addicts are no longer a menace to
society. </p>

<p><b>{{In this light, methadone programs have been very
successful. While methadone is addictive, it can be taken orally
and is much more long- lasting in preventing withdrawal than is
heroin.}}</b> </p>

<p>Many famous medical experts, such as Dr. Frederick H. Meyers
point out that the prescription of methadone (a narcotic) in such
large amounts proves that narcotics are not inherently dangerous.
</p>

<p><b>{{ A heroin addict needs an injection every few hours and
often becomes violent if he doesn't get it. }}</b> </p>

<p>A recent report by the Department of Justice titled
&quot;Drugs and Violence&quot; says that the only drug which has
any real connection to any kind of violent crime is alcohol. Even
if what you said was true, it would seem that we would be far
better off with an approach like they are using in Liverpool. A
managed daily prescription would seem to be the best way to
insure that this does not happen. If you had read any of the
studies I have mentioned, you would know that tobacco and alcohol
users exhibit the same kinds of anti-social behavior when they
are deprived of their drug. </p>

<p><b>{{ Finally, I would support expanded drug testing. At
present, the police are well equipped to test drunk drivers, but
narcotics users may evade punishment, unless they happen to have
the drugs in their possession. Definitely, police stations should
be equipped to test persons arrested for reckless driving and
similar offenses for drugs. Regular drug testing should also be a
part of all prison programs.}}</b> </p>

<p>Why wouldn't you support the same thing for alcohol and
tobacco? They do far more damage than illegal drugs so we would
be far better off to put the same effort against them. How about
it? Should we throw George Burns in jail because he refuses to
give up cigars? </p>

<p>And do you want to punish people based solely on their drug
tests? After all, you have money in your pocket right now with
cocaine dust on it and it is possible that enough of it got in to
your system to make you register positive. That is, of course, if
you didn't already test positive because you took a cold
medication, or a headache pill, or a cough syrup, or ate certain
kinds of bread, etc., etc., etc., <br>

<h2>CLAIM VI: LEGALIZATION AND DECRIMINALIZATION OF DRUGS HAVE
BEEN A DISMAL FAILURE IN OTHER NATIONS. </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> <br>
</h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The experiences of a number of foreign countries including
Great Britain, the Netherlands and Switzerland are often cited to
demonstrate that other nations have successfully controlled drug
use by offering access and areas where drug takers can obtain and
use drugs. Recently, an MTV documentary on the drug issue
highlighted coffeehouses in Amsterdam as a model for controlled,
successful environment in which young Europeans can enjoy
marijuana. </p>

<p>There was also a 60 Minutes segment on the drug clinics in
Liverpool, England, a special on the Arts &amp; Entertainment
Channel, and a special on ABC which explored the situation in
Europe. </p>

<p>Legalization proponents cannot find encouragement in the fact
that when drugs were once legal, cheap and available in the
United States, the impact on society was such that laws were
enacted to make drugs illegal. They ignore our own history and
point to Great Britain, the Netherlands and Switzerland as free
and open societies where drug use is allowed with no adverse
effects. The Quantico experts believed it is important to shed
light on the foreign experience with increased drug access and
liberalized use policies, and explain that this experience has
been negative </p>

<p>The statement of our own history is plainly false. Interested
readers should any of the major studies of drug policy listed in
this book. </p>

<p>England tried prescribing heroin but gave it up. Until the
mid1960s, British physicians were allowed to prescribe heroin to
certain classes of addicts. After this experiment, according to
James Q. Wilson in his 1990 article &quot;Against the
Legalization of Drugs&quot;, &quot;a youthful drug culture
emerged with a demand for drugs far different from that of the
older addicts.&quot; </p>

<p>The British system didn't work. Addiction levels rose,
especially among teenagers, and many addicts chose to boycott the
program and continued to get their heroin from pushers. </p>

<p>In 1983, England began switching over to methadone and stopped
dispensing heroin from the clinics, and that caused even more
addicts to depart in favor of the real thing. According to the
late John Kaplan of Stanford University, the number of addicts
increased fivefold. James Q. Wilson states that the British
Government's experiment with controlled heroin distribution
resulted in, at a minimum, a 30fold increase in the number of
addicts in ten years. </p>

<p>The Netherlands, despite its controlled program, is having
troubles. Under the socalled &quot;expediency principle&quot;
Dutch law protects individuals from prosecution for acts that are
technically illegal, including the retaillevel sales and purchase
of marijuana and hashish. Dutch police are also instructed to
ignore streetlevel sales of all types of drugs. </p>

<p>The Amsterdam Municipal Health Service showed a rise in
hardcore addicts in 1992, attributable to a significant rise in
the local heroin supply which led to a price drop of as much as
75%. </p>

<p>Switzerland has become a magnet for drug users the world over.
One thing small European nations have learned is a little
tolerance about drugs brings a lot of unwelcome visitors. In
1987, Zurich permitted drug use and sales in a part of the city
called the &quot;Platzspitz&quot;, dubbed &quot;Needle
Park.&quot; Five years later the experiment was curtailed after
an influx of addicts and increased violence and deaths. In 1992,
Zurich Municipal spokesman Andres Ohler told the New York Times
that the number of regular drug users at the park had swelled
from a few hundred in 1987 to 20,000 by 1992. After the
Platzspitz closed, the price of heroin reportedly doubled. </p>

<p>RESOLUTION </p>

<p>EUROPEAN CITIES </p>

<p>AGAINST DRUGS </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>A number of European cities have taken the initiative of
organizing a Conference </p>

<p>for Cities Against the Legalization of Drugs. One of the aims
of the conference is </p>

<p>to adopt a resolution to enable towns that have not
participated in the conference to </p>

<p>support its work. </p>

<p>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. The tide of the
drug policy debate began to turn against the DEA with the advent
of the Resolution for a Federal Commission on Drug Policy
(sometimes referred to as the Hoover Resolution). A copy of this
Resolution and a list of some of the major signers is included in
this book. </p>

<p>The purpose of the conference is to increase cooperation
between cities, to provide </p>

<p>inspiration and hope for areas with particularly difficult
drug problems. The signatories to the resolution will affirm
their decision to fight against the spread of drugs. </p>

<p>The DEA apparently thought the Resolution for a Federal
Commission on Drug Policy was so important that they figured they
had to trump up something to counter it. The result is this
really phony and poorly worded resolution against drugs. It is
notable that the DEA did not name any of the people who signed
this resolution on behalf of their entire city. </p>

<p>STOCKHOLM  28TH APRIL 1994 </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> In April, 1994, a number of European cities signed a
resolution titled &quot;European Cities Against Drugs,&quot;
commonly known as the Stockholm resolution. It states: &quot;The
demands to legalize illicit drugs should be seen against the
background of current problems, which have led to a feeling of
helplessness. For many, the only way to cope is to try to
administer the current situation. But the answer does not lie in
making harmful drugs more accessible, cheaper and socially
acceptable. Attempts to do this have not proved successful. We
believe that legalizing drugs will, in the long term, increase
our problems. By making them legal, society will signal that it
has resigned to the acceptance of drug abuse. The signatories to
this resolution therefore want to make their position clear by
rejecting the proposals to legalize illicit drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>It is interesting to note the differences between the
Resolution for a Federal Commission on Drug Policy and this
resolution. The biggest difference is that the Resolution for a
Federal Commission on Drug Policy does not say anything about
&quot;legalization&quot; but simply asks for an objective review
of the evidence. The DEA's resolution does not call for any
objective review of the evidence and, in fact, rejecting even the
idea of a discussion of alternatives. </p>

<p>Pointing to the appropriate international treaties which
require nations to &quot;protect children from the illicit use of
narcotic drugs,&quot; the signatories state that they
&quot;reject all demands for legalizing illicit drugs... We
request that our Governments respect and with determination apply
those conventions and agreements regarding drugs which they have
signed.&quot; </p>

<p>Again, the DEA's resolution calls for a blind rejection of any
ideas but there own, without consideration of any evidence. </p>

<p>The cities signing this resolution include: Berlin, Stockholm,
Budapest, Dublin, Gdansk (Poland), Gothenburg (Sweden), Helsinki,
Paris, Lugano (Switzerland), Madrid, Malmo (Sweden), Moscow,
Oslo, Prague, London, Reykjavik (Iceland), Riga (Latvia), St.
Petersburg (Russia), Tallinn (Estonia), Valletta (Malta) and
Warsaw. </p>

<p>It is notable that the DEA does not mention who in these
cities signed on behalf of the entire city. It is also notable
that many of the cities are former Soviet Union cities with
little experience in these areas. </p>

<p> A study by the Rotterdam Municipal Council shows that the
number of cocaine users there has risen substantially. About 3.3%
of all Rotterdam residents over 15 years of age or approximately
12,000 people now use cocaine. </p>

<p>Violent crime is also a major problem in the Netherlands. A
1992 study of crime victims in twenty (mostly European) countries
ranks the Netherlands as the number one country in Europe for
assaults and threats. </p>

<p>The Dutch Criminal Intelligence Service reported 104
gunrelated deaths in the Netherlands in 1992, compared to 73 in
1991. Almost all involved drug disputes. Robberies have also
increased in each of the four years since 1988. </p>

<p>The Netherlands, smaller than West Virginia, has more than 50
clinics supplying methadone to heroin addicts, and drug violators
make up a large percentage of prisoners in the Dutch prison
system. </p>

<p> Zurich authorities moved many addicts to a new site, a
nearby abandoned railway station, a few blocks north of Needle
Park. Here, addicts receive clean needles and are allowed to
inject heroin and consume other drugs. Writing in Drug Abuse
Update in 1994, Sue Rusche, executive director of National
Families in Action, gave this description of what passersby can
see if they look down from the Kornhaus Bridge: </p>

<p>&quot;Most people think shots are bloodless events. A nurse
inserts a needle, injects a medicine and you're on your way. But
here, bright red blood streams down arms, necks, legs, feet and
groins as addicts inject themselves. Festering red and purple
sores filled with pus, old blood and filthy scabs stretch from
wrist to elbow, ankle to knee.&quot; <br>

<h2>CLAIM VII: ALCOHOL HAS CAUSED SIGNIFICANT HEALTH, SOCIAL AND
CRIME PROBLEMS IN THIS COUNTRY, AND LEGALIZED DRUGS WOULD ONLY
MAKE THE SITUATION WORSE </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Many legalization advocates are fond of comparing the use of
alcohol with the use of drugs, yet draw faulty conclusions from
the comparison. People often consume small amounts of wine or
beer as a beverage and do not necessarily drink to the point of
mental impairment. This is not true of drug use, where the whole
point of use is intoxication. A more accurate analogy would be to
compare drug use to drunkenness. Yet even that analogy is weak,
because drugs are far more addictive than alcohol, and have no
cultural or social value. Dr. Mitchell Rosenthal points out, for
example, that only 10 percent of drinkers become alcoholics,
while up to 75 percent of regular illicit drug users become
addicted. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The point of use of alcohol is intoxication, just as it is for
the illegal drugs. Even small amounts of alcohol will relax a
person or change their mood. This is intoxication, it is just a
mild intoxication. If you don't want the intoxication, there is
very little reason to drink alcoholic wine or beer instead of
their non-alcoholic versions. The alcoholic versions are the
major sellers so it is a fair assumption that most alcohol
drinkers want the mild intoxication which comes from a couple of
beers. </p>

<p>Most users of most drugs want a relatively mild intoxication
from their drug of choice. That is one of the main reasons that
wine and beer outsell the harder beverages, and why most illegal
drug use is the use of marijuana. </p>

<p>This argument is a distortion in itself because it lumps all
illicit drugs together, as if they had the same capacity to
addict. Clearly, there are major differences between drugs such
as heroin, cocaine, and marijuana, and Dr. Rosenthal is
irresponsible not to point them out. </p>

<p>Dr. Rosenthal's figures could not possibly be true, based on
the DEA's own evidence shown above in their chart showing the
supposed drop in drug use. The DEA's own figures shows the number
of regular drug users is far higher than the number of addicts
and always has been. By the DEA's own figures at least 85 percent
are not addicted, and at least 70 percent are gainfully employed.
</p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization note--correctly--that alcohol kills
many more Americans than do illegal drugs and currently exact
social and financial costs that are higher as well. Advocates
claim that many people do not use alcohol, and that many
Americans may also choose to forego drugs. Like treatment
programs available for alcohol addicted people, treatment for
drug addicts should be more widely available. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA admits that alcohol causes far more damage than the
illegal drugs but they don't seem to propose that we bring back
alcohol Prohibition. </p>

<p>What the DEA does not say is the degree to which alcohol and
tobacco cause more damage than illegal drugs. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The experts assembled at the AntiLegalization Forum pointed to
already overburdened health care and social systems that are
unable to address all the problems associated with alcohol use.
Instead of compounding these problems, and acknowledging the
crime problems made worse by alcohol use, the group stated that
legalizing drugs would create undue burdens on the criminal,
health and social service systems. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The group points out that the &quot;already overburdened
health care and social systems . . . are unable to address all
the problems associated with alcohol use&quot;, yet no one
proposes that we bring back alcohol Prohibition as the best
approach to the problem. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Alcohol use in this country has taken a tremendous physical
toll on Americans, not to mention the social problems that have
resulted from its use. Legalization proponents would have us
compound our problems by creating a new class of drug addicted
Americans. Again, how much are we willing to tolerate? To pay
for? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Should we bring back alcohol Prohibition as a means of dealing
with alcohol problems? Clearly not. The message of Prohibition is
clear: Alcohol is bad, but Prohibition is worse. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Look at the problems that alcohol abuse has wrought. In the
1920s those advocating the repeal of Prohibition argued that
crime and other social ills would be alleviated if alcohol were
legal. Has that happened? We now have approximately 11 million
alcoholics or problem drinkers in this country whose behavior has
contributed to lost productivity in the workplace, fetal defects,
traffic fatalities, domestic violence and other crime. If drugs
were made legal, the numbers and the problems would swell. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Is the DEA arguing that the best approach to the alcohol
problems is to bring back Prohibition? Why not? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The simple fact is that if drugs are made legal, more people
will use drugs. There will be higher health and social costs;
there will be more crime. Some facts which help to confirm the
observations of the forum participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The Wickersham Commission, which was originally formed to
improve alcohol Prohibition, found that alcohol use fell in the
first year of Prohibition but rose every year thereafter. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> In a May, 1993 report titled &quot;Survey of State Prison
Inmates,&quot; the Bureau of Justice Statistics states that 32%
of inmates committed their offense under the influence of
alcohol. Slightly more than twofifths of inmates convicted of
homicide or assault committed their current offense under the
influence of alcohol or of alcohol with drugs. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is another curious argument. It is clear that the biggest
problem here is alcohol, as the DEA itself states. If the DEA was
really consistent in their position, they would advocate the
return of alcohol prohibition. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> According to the 1993 National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse, about 11 million Americans were heavy drinkers in 1993
(drinking five or more drinks per occasion on five or more days
in the past 30 days). Heavy alcohol use has changed little since
1985, when there were 12 million heavy drinkers. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Assuming the figures are accurate, it would obviously not be a
sensible approach to the problem to attempt throw all these
people in prison. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The same report indicates that &quot;of the 11 million heavy
drinkers in 1993, 26 percent (3 million) were also current
illicit drug users.&quot; The report goes on to say that
&quot;Current smokers are more likely to be heavy drinkers and
illicit drug users. Among smokers in 1993, 11 percent were heavy
drinkers and 12 percent were illicit drug users.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA seems to be trying to make the discredited argument
about &quot;gateway drugs&quot;. That is, they used to contend
that some drugs, by some as-yet-unexplained process, naturally
created a craving for totally unrelated drugs in people who had
never used drugs before. This was a holdover from their earlier,
plainer and even more easily discredited argument that marijuana
leads to heroin. (Which, by the way, was in direct contradiction
to Harry Anslinger's testimony before Congress when marijuana was
outlawed.) </p>

<p>People who engage in one form of risky behavior often engage
in other risky behaviors. That is the only thing that these kinds
of statistics could show. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> In a 1993 report by Brandeis University, it was estimated
that the United States spent $10.5 billion on health care related
to alcohol use. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Then why shouldn't we bring back Prohibition as the best way
to deal with the problem? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Alcohol is blamed for between $140 and $210 billion per
year in lost productivity. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Then why shouldn't we bring back Prohibition as the best way
to deal with the problem? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> 17,461 people were killed in alcohol related traffic
incidents in 1993. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>That is almost as many people as the American Medical
Association estimates were killed by all illegal drugs from all
causes combined. Clearly, if the DEA wanted to do something about
the real drug problem, it would be of more benefit to concentrate
their enforcement efforts on alcohol. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Michigan's Director of the Office of Drug Control Policy,
Robert Peterson, states that &quot;It is estimated that alcohol
abuse costs the nation $100 billion per year and over 300 lives
per day, an amount that the $18 billion in state and federal
excise tax revenue does not begin to cover.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>And yet no one contends that throwing wine and beer drinkers
in prison is a sensible approach to this problem. <br>

the Persuasive Strategies which have been giving the DEA such
fits over the last few years. They were originally published on
Compuserve and have since been copied to every major online
service. In August, 1994, the DEA held a special conference in
Washington and flew in law enforcement people, politicians, and
public relations experts to try to figure out some way to deal
with the fact that they were getting hammered every time they
came out for a debate. These Persuasive Strategies were the
specific reason for that conference and their booklet <a
href="how2men.htm">How to Hold Your Own In a Drug Legalization
Debate</a> was a direct response to, and borrowed from, the
Persuasive Strategies. </p>

<h1>What's Next? </h1>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> This is my view of what is the current most important step in
promoting drug policy reform. This includes some suggestions on
how you can help. </p>

<p> <img src="../GRAPHICS/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2><a name="DDE_LINK2"><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif"
align="BOTTOM"></a>WHAT IS THE MAIN PRIORITY AT THIS POINT? </h2>

<p> A few people have asked the basic question, What's next? What
is the main priority at this point? </p>

<p> A good question. In order to answer it correctly we have to
back up and review the current state of affairs. </p>

<h2><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">WHERE ARE
WE WITH RESPECT TO THE GOALS? </h2>

<p> First, it is necessary to establish where we are with respect
to our goals. Atlanta has come and gone. I don't think the drug
warriors got as much publicity as perhaps they wanted, and it
looks like a flash in the pan. No doubt they will try to use
their resolution as proof of something </p>

<p> when they are pressed in the debate. In their rather
simplistic view of the issue they have confused the main point
and will continue to lose debates as time goes on. As Drug Czar
Lee Brown has recently stated, their strategy will be to pretend
that the issue doesn't exist. They just don't want to hear about
it. </p>

<p> The bottom line is that Atlanta won't do much to change the
long term trend in public thinking, particularly if we are
intelligent about what we do. The trend is going our way and will
continue to go our way. Little by little, we are working our way
to a majority. </p>

<h2><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">THE HOOVER
RESOLUTION? </h2>

<p> Alan asks if the main priority at this point should be to
push the Hoover Resolution. In a sense, that should be the main
priority, but we have to recognize the underlying issues
involved. </p>

<p> The Hoover Resolution was built upon the recognition of the
single biggest flaw behind the drug war -- ignorance. No one
could support these kinds of policies if they had even read the
evidence, so I knew that every drug warrior could be defeated if
you could just get to the evidence. A good knowledge of the
evidence is enough to publicly destroy any of them. </p>

<p> The Hoover Resolution has already been successful to a
certain extent. The last Crime Bill provided for a commission
which is due to start work in 1996. They are now selecting people
to sit on the commission, but I have no idea of their progress on
selecting any members. There is still some question about whether
it will come off or, if it does, who will be on it or how deeply
it will delve into the issues. </p>

<p> Regardless of the commission, we should be prepared with the
information the commission should read, or that anyone should
read on this issue. We should have such complete evidence and
research on the issue that anyone who wants information on the
issue will have to come to us. </p>

<h3>IS IT PROPER TO REFER TO IT AS THE HOOVER RESOLUTION? </h3>

<p> No, but I often do it anyway. </p>

<h3>SHOULD WE POST THE HOOVER RESOLUTION ON A FORM? </h3>

<p> Sure. As long as we follow all of the original rules of the
Hoover Resolution -- that is, it must be very clear what the
people are agreeing to -- only what the Resolution states.
Signatures must include name, title, mailing address, and the
form should ask them if they would like to join any of the
various national organizations. </p>

<h3><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">MEMBERSHIP
SUBSCRIPTION PAGES </h3>

<p> We should have an independent membership page for each of the
organizations covered under our group. People should be allowed
to subscribe on-line. We don't have to hassle the problems with
credit cards or anything yet, just let them enter their name and
address and the organization can send them an envelope. </p>

<h2><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">WHY WILL
THE DRUG WAR FALL? </h2>

<p> The drug war will eventually fall for the same reason that
communism fell. That is, they are both repressive systems which
depend upon hiding or ignoring knowledge iin pursuit of an
ideological goal. As such they are wildly impractical, and that
impracticality becomes more apparent as more knowledge becomes
available. The Soviet Union fell because, in order to enforce
their restrictions on knowledge, they had to put photocopy
machines under lock and key and require forms to be filled out
every time someone wanted to make a copy. You can imagine the
effect that would have on a modern competitive business. The
invention of the personal computer was their complete downfall.
It became apparent that they could not have a modern economy if
they did not have person computers, fax machines, and the like.
But, of course, that meant that everyone was a publisher. If
everyone is a publisher, sooner or later the truth is going to
get out. </p>

<p> Computers and the Internet will be the key elements which
bring down the drug war. Political systems based on ignorance
will come down because of the information which can be made
available to anyone through computers. That is also the
fundamental idea behind the CD ROM -- widespread public education
of the facts. We will win our struggle as soon as the public
knows the facts. We have taken the first steps with the formal
establishment of our org. </p>

<p> <img src="../GRAPHICS/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">#1
PRIORITY -- GET THE KNOWLEDGE ASSEMBLED </h2>

<p> Our Number One Priority at this point should be to locate all
of the information on drug policy that we can find, convert it to
computer format, and post it in a commonly accessed place on the
web. We should set up an interlinked network of web pages
accessible from a single web page which serves as a directory.
Behind these web pages should be all of the information we can
get. Remember all the times that people on the net have asked
questions or argued about some aspect of the drug issue? No more.
Any time anyone has a question, we should be able to point
directly to documents on-line which provide an immediate answer. </p>

<h3>WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION? </h3>

<p> Anything relevant to the subject. We have nothing at all to
fear from the truth and you will notice that, on my web pages, I
will include materials which are propaganda of the opposition.
Ultimately, we gain the most from the broadest range of
information. We should scan, retrieve, enter by hand, or do
whatever we can to build the best library anyone has ever seen on
the subject. We have to make our web sites an absolute must-see
for any member of the media who wants to do anything on the
subject. (Please note that, even while the public as a whole may
not be on the net yet, the media is far more likely to be
connected to the net. This is an issue on which we can, in
effect, force their behavior. If our web pages have enough
information, they will be forced to come to us.) </p>

<p> Think of it this way. In the course of these conversations we
have passed back and forth a lot of good solid information to
each other, such as the information put forth on hemp, or the
backgrounds of Voth and Nahas. That kind of information should be
posted so it is available to anyone who wants it, any time they
need it. The only real difference is that we should use a less
conversational style. That is, when we post the information to
the library, it should be in &quot;encyclopedia style&quot; </p>

<h3>A CENTRAL ENTRY POINT - The World's Best Library on Drug
Policy. </h3>

<p> Right now, if we want to tell the media about our growing
library of on-line information, we would have to give them the
names of a multitude of web sites and tell them to go poke around
on their own. We need one main menu page to give them for the
library. </p>

<p> We should establish a central entry point to all the web
sites of interest. This one home page would list all of the other
web pages which have factual information of interest on the
subject. This will make it easy for us to give the media a single
access point where they can find all of the information. That is
important in uniformly advertising it to the media around the
world. </p>

<p> That central point should have an index (updated once a month
perhaps) which will point to each of the web sites and provide
some sort of explanation as to what kind of materials are behind
it. </p>

<h3>MAKE SURE THE MEDIA KNOWS WHERE TO GO FOR INFO </h3>

<p> Then we will have to make sure that ALL the media knows that
they have to go to our page if they are going to discuss the drug
issue. That will require a dedicated campaign to publish the
location of our unified home page to all media sources. Our next
priority will be to make sure that everyone in the media knows
where to look. We will each have to contact our local news
sources and make sure they know. It should be mentioned as a
standard reference in every letter to the editor, for example. We
should mention our unified home page everywhere we go. Print it
on your letterhead and business cards. </p>

<p> <img src="../GRAPHICS/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h3>TASKS TO BE DONE </h3>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">Top Items
to be Put on the Web </h4>

<p> This is a list, somewhat incomplete as yet, of the top items
we intend to put on the web pages as soon as we can. We ask
everyone to help us by contributing this information in
electronic form. If you have it, you can e-mail it to
schaffer@smartlink.net. And thanks! </p>

<p> If all you have is a paper copy, we would appreciate that
too. You can send stuff to Dave Borden at Drug Policy Foundation,
4455 Connecticut Ave., N.W., Suite B-500, Washington, DC
20008-2302. </p>

<p> You can snail-mail stuff to me at: <b>Cliff Schaffer, P.O.
Box 1430, Canyon Country, CA 91386-1430</b> </p>

<p> 1. Information for Dave Bordens &quot;Tour of the War on
Drugs&quot;. Use your imagination here, but if you were going to
give someone a tour of the War on Drugs, what would you include?
It should have lots of interesting facts, graphics, documents,
etc. </p>

<p> 2. A video file which contains a good quality copy of
&quot;Hemp for Victory&quot;. We would like to put in online
where it can be distributed to the world. If you already have a
computer and a VCR, the cost of the video capture board is
currently running around $500 to $700. Or maybe you know someone
who has one . . . </p>

<p> 3. The full text of any of the reference sources listed in
the <a href="../LIBRARY/studlist.html">Biggest Studies of Drug
Policy</a>. We much prefer the electronic format but if all you
have is a good paper copy, we will try to work with it. </p>

<p> 4. The full text of the Congressional Record for the portions
relevant to both the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914 and the
Marijuana Tax Act of 1937. </p>

<p> 5. Charts, pictures, etc., which show the current statistics
for all of the issues related to drug policy. </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">SCANNING </h4>

<p> We have a huge task ahead of us. We must convert tens of
thousands of pages of information to computer format. Most of the
information, such as the major studies of drug policy, never was
in computer format and some of the documents are quite large. The
task will probably take man years of scanning effort to be
properly accomplished. The only way we will get it done (with our
limited financial resources) is if everyone does a little bit. I
strongly recommend that you get a scanner as soon as possible.
You don't need much, a simple gray scale scanner with OCR will do
the trick. Shop around and you can install a minimum page-feed
scanner in an existing computer system, with OCR for about $250.
A good quality flat-bed color scanner with a page feed option
currently runs about $1,000. I have found from my own experience
that the handheld scanners are not adequate to the task. </p>

<p> Does anyone know where we can get scanners cheaply (free) to
distribute to volunteers who will commit to using them? </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">GETTING
THE WORD OUT TO THE MEDIA </h4>

<p> We will need volunteers who will help us get the word out to
the lawmakers and the media when we are ready to launch. Anyone
can help here, if they have a telephone, a stamp, or an e-mail
address. </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">FORMATTING
AND ORGANIZING </h4>

<p> We will also need people to specialize in the librarian
function. That is, we must have people who are willing to spend
the time to: </p>

<p> Organize the data so it has a logical structure and is easy
to find. </p>

<p> Establish links from references in one document to the actual
text of the cited documents. </p>

<p> Format good looking web pages according to a standard format </p>

<p> We will need standards for how the web pages will be
constructed and their overall look. (Please understand, it is not
that I want to limit your creativity with web pages, it is just
that we want to present to the public the look of a uniform,
organized library.) I recommend that anyone who is interested in
working on this end of the task should buy a copy of Teach
Yourself Web Publishing With HTML In A Week, by Laura Lemay from
Sams Publishing. I just got a copy and found it quite helpful. </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">READING
AND SUMMARIZING </h4>

<p> There will be a lot of information on line. We will need
people to read through volumes of information and prepare
accurate summaries on a chapter by chapter basis. </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">PROGRAMMING
</h4>

<p> Someone will have to program the membership forms and other
stuff required by this little venture. </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">WHERE TO
GO TO GET THE DATA </h4>

<p> 1. Information from other on-line services. We must
accumulate all of the information in a place we control and
organize. </p>

<p> 2. Government sources. A lot of the government agencies are
now publishing information in computer format, including CD-ROM.
We should make it a point to get all of this information we can
and bring it together in a logical organization which makes it
easy for people to find. </p>

<p> 3. Historical records. A good project for anyone would be to
go to the library and browse through the newspapers of anywhere
from 1860 to the present and get copies of all the articles they
can find relating to drugs. </p>

<p> 4. Private collections of documents. I have already contacted
a number of prominent people to ask them if we can get their
personal records which relate to drug policy. We want to develop
a depth of information which cannot be challenged and the private
records of individuals involved in the drug war is a good way to
do it. </p>

<p> 5. NIDA research. The National Instiute on Drug Abuse has
published volumes of data on all sorts of issues. We should start
with the most interesting stuff. </p>

<p> 6. The Congressional Record. We need to get on-line the
entire text of the Congressional Record relating to all of our
current drug laws. Most important-- we must get the text of the
original proceedings behind these laws. Harry Anslinger's words
should be posted in a place where all the world can read them. </p>

<p> 7. Current Media. Scan and/or summarize articles from your
local newspaper. Include the full citations of the name of the
newspaper, the headline of the article and the date it was
published. Also include a summary, length as appropriate, of the
major points made in the article. If we can get permission to
reprint, we should do so. If not, we will publish a summary of
the points made in the article, but retain the scanned text in a
private library for backup. </p>

<p> 8. Videos and movies. We should convert things such as Hemp
for Victory to computer format. This can be done with a computer,
a VCR, and a video capture board (now down to as low as $179.00) </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">WEB PAGE
STANDARDS </h4>

<p> I suggest the following as a preliminary suggestion for web
page standards. More complete standards, including a template,
should be developed by a committee working on the formatting and
organizing team. </p>

<p> 1. All web pages should include both the name of the current
page plus the name of the central home page. This will make sure
that anyone who prints out the information will know where it
came from. The name of the central home page should also be
included as a header in all text files on the net. </p>

<p> 2. All menus should contain links back to your own home page
as well as the central home page. </p>

<p> 3. All menu pages should include the title of the document,
and a description of the author and the contents of the work. </p>

<p> 4. All web pages under your own home page should have a
consistent layout. The layout should be simple and without
excessive graphics, so it doesn't take a month to download them. </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">COPYRIGHTS
</h4>

<p> Under current copyright law we cannot post anything which is
copyrighted without the permission of the copyright owner. Here
is how to get around this restriction and still have a complete
on-line library. </p>

<p> 1) Any material produced by any government agency, or the
texts of official statements by public officials is in the public
domain and may be posted without any problems. </p>

<p> 2) The current copyright law is that copyrights are effective
for the life of the creator plus fifty years. The old law was
that copyrights were valid for 28 years with a renewal of 28
years. What this means is (with some exceptions) materials
published before about 1940 have probably fallen into the public
domain. </p>

<ol>
    <li>I have a feeling that, if some people or organizations
        were asked, they would grant us permission to post their
        materials, or at least excerpts from the materials. If we
        cannot get permission, we will post our own written
        summaries of the materials -- reviews of the essential
        points made by the document. </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM">Where do we
go from here? </p>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> The tide has turned in the war against the War on Drugs. It
is a tough fight, but those who support drug policy reform have
begun to carry the day. There have been three major television
specials on the issue in less than a year and the DEA openly
admitted their arguments were in trouble when they called a
special conference last August to try to find ways to argue
against reform. They have been getting pretty well shellacked in
every single debate over the last few years and the media has
begun to seriously question the wisdom of the drug war. The drug
warriors are in retreat and they know it. </p>

<p> The big question for those who support reform is: Where do we
go from here? Activists from around the world have been
discussing this on the Internet, and here are some of the
answers. </p>

<h2>The Internet </h2>

<p> Rapid communication is critical to this movement. Activists
from around the world have joined together on the Internet to
discuss ideas and provide support for each other in a wide
variety of ways. There are plans for a bigger and better presence
on the Internet where news, research, and ideas will be available
to anyone with a computer, and where people from around the world
can work together. We need more people on the Internet. We also
need someone in every city who is plugged in to the network and
can distribute the news on a timely basis to those who are not
yet on the Internet. </p>

<h2>Unity </h2>

<p> The Internet has also brought unity. The biggest single
thrust of the DEA in their public relations campaign is that we
lack unity. The DEA tells the public that those who support
reform don't even agree among themselves on what they want and,
therefore, they could never build a credible public policy. For
many years it was true. We have a number of organizations and
groups around the country who have always agreed on their
opposition to the drug war but have usually worked alone to
pursue their goals. As a result, we looked like a mob, rather
than a team. </p>

<p> Through the internet, we have held lengthy on-line
&quot;meetings&quot; where many of the leading activists and
organizations have discussed where we agreed and disagreed, and
how we could work together toward the goals we all shared. As the
result of those meetings, we have formulated a basic statement of
our objective and the principles which should be the basis for a
better drug policy. They are: </p>

<h2>Our Objective </h2>

<p> Our objective is to bring drugs within the law. </p>

<h2>Principles for a Solution. </h2>

<p> We believe that a better drug policy should be based on three
basic principles: </p>

<p> 1) Decisions on the medical use of drugs should be the sole
province of the medical profession in consultation with its
patients. </p>

<p> 2) Punishment should not be used to control private drug use.
</p>

<p> 3) We must have a consistent policy for all drugs of
potential abuse. </p>

<p> We ask all interested people and groups around the nation to
join us in a recognition of our common goals and present a united
front to the world. We all agree that we need reform now. The
first step toward reform is to press for open and honest
discussion of the issue. </p>

<h2>Better Public Relations </h2>

<p> When it comes to funding for media, we are clearly outgunned
by the drug warriors. But, over the last few years we have just
as clearly beaten them with a better, more sensible message. We
need a grass roots effort to educate the media at all levels.
Keep track of your local newspaper, television, and radio
stations and make sure that the old hysterical lies and
half-truths of the drug war do not go unchallenged. We have
proven that the media will come our way if they know the facts. </p>

<h2>Recruitment </h2>

<p> We all know people who are not members of the DPF but should
be. Many of them are not members simply because no one has asked
them to join, or they don't know the DPF is there. No one has
told them that their support is important. We should all make a
commitment to recruit at least one new member in the coming
month. It's easy. All you need to do is ask them. When you leave
the house tomorrow morning, carry a membership application and a
stamped envelope addressed to the DPF. I will bet you find a new
ally before noon. </p>

<h2>The Next Step </h2>

<p> We have already demonstrated that when the evidence is
examined the drug warriors don't have a leg to stand on. They
have lost every debate in the last few years because of the
evidence, so the last thing they want now is a public discussion
of the evidence. Their &quot;anti-legalization&quot; resolution
even says so, in so many words. Even the mere discussion of
possible alternatives, they say, will cause a massive increase in
drug addiction. </p>

<p> We want to talk about alternatives. We want to review the
evidence. We want openness, honesty, and objectivity in a public
review of all we know about drug policy. We want to lay the cards
on the table and let the chips fall where they may. The drug
warriors do not. Therein lies the difference between us. </p>

<p> Our mission is to draw the drug warriors into a public
debate. We must ask the media to ask them: &quot;What's wrong
with the truth? Why don't you want to read the evidence? Why
won't you discuss it? If you are right, the evidence will surely
show it.&quot; We have nothing to fear from the truth. <br>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM">Political
Strategies </p>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> This is a first crack at the kinds of political strategies we
must use to end the drug war. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
win by knockout. </h2>

<p> I believe that we must pick issues where we can by knockout.
The odds are so stacked against us that, unless we win by
knockout, we will not win at all. </p>

<p> While I agree with the economics and civil liberties
arguments for decriminalization, I do not favor the use of these
issues as a primary focus. The primary reason that I do not like
the arguments on economics or civil liberties is because they are
highly intellectual arguments which could be debated all day with
no clear resolution. They make people think too much, and that
slows down decision-making. We want issues which will change
people's minds forever -- and do it today. I believe that these
arguments may be useful to convince other people like us, but it
will not convince large masses of Americans. </p>

<p> There are two primary issues where I believe we can win by
knockout right now. They are the treatment of medical patients,
and the issue of African-American men. In both cases we have
clear, overwhelming arguments which would get the immediate
agreement of large masses of Americans. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
build a coalition of constituencies. </h2>

<p> We must bring people of different persuasions together to
support our cause. In our Resolution, we have already chosen a
broadly based statement which does not use the &quot;D&quot; word
and which could be supported by people of all persuasions. That
is step one. </p>

<p> Next we, need to formally identify our constituencies and the
specific arguments which will be most relevant to those groups. </p>

<p> Some constituencies are: </p>

<p> Doctors - The relevant issues here are the persecution of
doctors and the treatment of medical patients. </p>

<p> Medical Patient Groups - The relevant issue is the treatment
of medical patients. </p>

<p> African-Americans - The relevant issue is the incarceration
and economic destruction of African-American men. </p>

<p> I believe that doctors and African-Americans are absolutely
vital to our success and that every one of us should take
immediate steps to recruit them to our cause. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
form &quot;intervention groups&quot; and target specific
individuals that we need on our side. </h2>

<p> We have used an approach which someone likened to an Alcohols
Anonymous intervention group. We assembled a group of people that
we knew an important person would find persuasive. Then we all
went together to that person and explained our concerns in terms
that were important to that person. Then we asked for support,
not for the &quot;D&quot; word, but for general drug policy
reform. </p>

<p> This technique is highly effective and will enable us to
change the thinking of many important people, or at least start
them down the slippery slope to the &quot;D&quot; word. I believe
that we should all commit to participating in at least one of
these intervention groups to change the mind of at least one
important person. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
seek action. </h2>

<p> We have already asked for public hearings. As many of you
have already stated, public hearings may not come about and, even
if they do, they may not change anything. Therefore, we must seek
other means which will also bring about clear public
confrontations on the issue. When those confrontations occur, we
must all respond unanimously. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
provide support for people who speak out for drug policy reform. </h2>

<p> We all know that many people are reluctant to speak out for
reform because of the McCarthy-like tactics of our opposition. We
must come to the defense of anyone who is criticized or vilified
because of their support for a change in drug policy. Point out
that people are not vilified because they are Republican,
Democrat, or Libertarian, but people are vilified if they even
want to discuss a different drug policy. This is McCarthyism. <br>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM">Local
Action strategies </p>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">1. Contact
your local media. Tell them about these web pages and the
information on them.<br>
</h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">2. Read
the newspapers and respond. </h2>

<p> Make it a point to read the largest newspapers in your area
and be alert for drug-policy related news stories. Write short,
punchy letters to the editor to make your views heard. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">3. Contact
the talk shows in your area. </h2>

<p> Most TV and radio talk shows need a steady stream of
controversial subjects to make the shows interesting. Sooner or
later, they will all do a show on drug policy. Go through your TV
listings and locate all talk and news shows. Call the stations
and ask for the producers of the show. In most cases, it will
surprise you how easy it is to get through. Tell them about the
resolution and the people supporting it. Let them know that there
are prominent people now willing to come forward and debate this
idea publicly. Producers are probably extremely busy, so keep it
short, punchy, and sweet. Have some juicy &quot;sound bites&quot;
planned to stimulate interest. Follow up with a letter and
printed material such as the things I have enclosed. Keep in
touch with them every ninety days or so, just to make sure that
they don't forget you. </p>

<p> If you get a spot on a good TV show and then don't know what
to do -- call me. We'll work something out. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">4. Develop
a constituency. </h2>

<p> Contact groups and members of groups to put on a presentation
and persuade them to support the resolution. There are all kinds
of groups which may support this resolution, each for their own
individual reasons. They include African-Americans, ministers,
doctors, medical patients, law enforcement officials, AIDS
groups, and many others. Pick groups that you think you can
persuade and then develop the issues which are most important to
them. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">5. Pick
one influential person at a time and persuade them. </h2>

<p> When you have persuaded them that it is time for a change,
and that we should at least look at other drug policy options,
get them to commit to going with you to persuade at least two
more influential people. Use this technique to &quot;move up the
ladder&quot; to more and more influential people. </p>

<p> Use the &quot;intervention group&quot; approach. Assemble a
small group of people whom your target will view as influential
and persuasive. Arrange a meeting where all can attend and have
all those people ask the person to reconsider their point of
view. Don't ask them to support legalization or
decriminalization, because it is unlikely that you could persuade
them in one meeting anyway. Just get them to admit that there is
enough of a question about the issue that it is time to
re-examine the evidence and commit to the investigation of the
possibility of change. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">6. Enlist
your friends to create a steady &quot;rain&quot; of resolutions
on the White House. </h2>

<p> Get everyone to commit to sending a resolution a week. Keep
it up until we get the commission. Let Clinton know that this
resolution is not going to go away. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">7. Develop
phone networks to get people to respond when we need them to
respond. </h2>

<p> The National Rifle Association is powerful because, at any
given time, it can bombard the President and Congress with
millions of letters and phone calls. We need the same type of
response. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">8. Put on
debates and seminars at colleges. </h2>

<p> Colleges and universities often have philosophy, public
administration, law enforcement, or political science professors
who might like to put on a public forum or debate on drug policy.
Call the local colleges and ask for the heads of these
departments, or anyone else you think might be interested.
Suggest the idea to them. </p>

<p> I have enclosed a sample speech from one of the debates I was
in. You can edit it as appropriate to your needs. I have never
had anyone make an intelligent comeback to that speech. </p>

<p> The enclosed charts can be blown up to 18 inch by 24 inch
size by places such as Kinko's Copies for about $2.50 to $5.00
each, depending upon whether you get them on ordinary paper or on
card stock. For large audiences, consider taking 35mm slide
pictures of the graphs. If you are out in the middle of the woods
and can't do either of those things, write to me and, if you pay
for it, I will have it done for you. </p>

<p> The biggest problem you may have with this tactic is that the
local gendarmes and prosecutors are becoming increasingly
reluctant to come out in public and defend the drug war. They
have been getting their butts kicked far too much lately and even
the most fervent drug warriors are now having a hard time with
their beliefs. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">9. Contact
local civic organizations. </h2>

<p> In most towns, there are various local civic organizations
that might want to have presentations on the drug war for any of
a variety of reasons. Some of them will do it just for the
entertainment value. Go through the phone book and locate the
Rotarians, the Elks, etc. and ask them if they would be
interested. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">10. Write
to and call your local Congressman. </h2>

<p> Most members of Congress are chowder-heads, but there are
some out there who are intelligent enough to read the facts and
stand up for the truth. We won't know who they are until people
like you can find them. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">11.
Produce Local Access Cable Shows. </h2>

<p> You can become a producer for local access cable channels
with as little as five hours of mostly free classes. Call your
local cable company for information. Once you become a producer
you can use their facilities to tape shows, or you can broadcast
tapes which were prepared by others. We have already done this a
few times and have a number of shows which can be made available
to anyone who is hooked in to their local access cable channels. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">12. Don't
get discouraged. </h2>

<p> It may take time to build your persuasive skills and even the
best of us don't persuade everybody the first time around. Keep
it up, despite the setbacks, and you will eventually prevail. <br>

<h1>Persuasive Strategies</h1>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>Dos </h2>

<h3>The issue is prison. </h3>

<p> The issue is not legalization or decriminalization because we
really do not know if we will ever do those things, or anything
like them. The issue is prison. The issue is how many millions of
people will have to go to prison before this policy is
successful. </p>

<p> You cannot successfully defend decriminalization or
legalization to most people at this point, because it is not here
and they cannot see it. Turn the issue around on them, and make
them defend what we are doing now. The drug war has not worked
and there is not a drug law enforcement official in the United
States who pretends that it can work. Once they are on the
defensive, it is easy to get them to admit that it is time to
look for another approach -- whatever that approach might be. </p>

<h3>Do your homework. </h3>

<p> There is enough information in the references I have listed
to sink anyone who supports the use of jails for drugs. That's
why the reports were written. </p>

<h3>Be reasonable. </h3>

<p> If you can present a sound and reasonable approach to solving
the drug problem, and maintain that stance, you will
short-circuit most of the negative emotions and hostility which
may be raised against you. Notice that I have said a reasonable
&quot;approach&quot; to solving the drug problem, not a
reasonable &quot;solution&quot; to the drug problem. By approach,
I mean a method of finding a solution. Do not try to present a
solution because, as discussed later, that only gets you into
trouble. Instead, promote a fair and reasonable method of finding
a solution -- such as the objective commission called for by the
Hoover Resolution. </p>

<p> At the same time, this reasonable stance forces our opponents
to either be reasonable and follow us toward reform, or adopt
ever more extreme positions on drugs. One of my favorite
questions for them is: &quot;What do you have against an open and
honest review of the evidence?&quot; </p>

<p> If they do not agree to an open and honest review of the
evidence then they clearly demonstrate that they are too extreme
to even consider the facts. If they do agree to the review, then
I have them every time because I have already read the evidence
and I know what it says. </p>

<h3>Judo is better than boxing. </h3>

<p> You can beat someone with boxing, in which case you knock
them down with your weight. Or, you can beat someone with judo,
in which case you knock them down with their own weight. Judo is
always better than boxing when you have to persuade someone. Use
the arguments your audience finds persuasive, not the arguments
you find persuasive. </p>

<p> For example, if you encounter a fundamentalist Christian,
nothing you will say to them will have any meaning to them at all
unless they believe that Jesus Christ would support what you are
saying. So far most of them have believe that drug users should
be thrown in prison because drug use is immoral -- that is, Jesus
would not approve of drug use. I have found that the best
approach to these people is to help them to understand it in
their own terms. What I say is: </p>

<p> &quot;You are certainly a better Christian than I am so you
tell me. If Jesus came down here today and we gave the drug
problem to him, what do you think he would do? Would he build
bigger prisons? Or would he build hospitals and schools?&quot; </p>

<p> When the issue is stated in these simple terms, most of them
will come around right away. They will immediately see the good
sense in an approach that heals, rather than punishes. </p>

<h3>Avoid complex arguments </h3>

<p> The supporters of the drug war have, in keeping with their
general intellectual level, made the simplest propaganda
possible. The eggs in the frying pan commercial is a good
example. In order to compete with them, it is necessary to make
arguments which are as simple and as easily understood as
possible. There are a lot of ways to get really complicated in a
drug argument but two of the favorites are arguments based on
civil liberties and economics. Please keep in mind that I agree
with the arguments based on civil liberties and economics, I just
don't find them persuasive to others. </p>

<p> Arguments based on such topics as civil liberties or
economics are not likely to be persuasive for three reasons: </p>

<p> 1) They are complicated issues which take a lot of thought.
Even if you come up with a reasonable sounding argument today,
someone will just confuse them tomorrow with an equally good
sounding argument. </p>

<p> 2) Surveys consistently show that a large portion of the
American public would readily sacrifice their civil liberties to
try to solve some mythical problem. </p>

<p> 3) The people who are likely to be persuaded are already
persuaded. </p>

<p> There are exceptions to every rule, of course, but, in
general, most people will not be persuaded by philosophical
arguments about civil liberties, or arcane arguments about
economics. It may be sad, but it is true. </p>

<p> One of the major exceptions to this is property owners.
Property owners in California have become very sensitive to the
fact that their property can be seized even though they knew
nothing at all about criminal activity on the property. Property
owners can be a pretty vocal group so they should not be
overlooked as allies. </p>

<p> Economic arguments, when used, should be simplified to avoid
long-winded discussions which do not resolve anything. For
example: With $500,000 of tax money we can put one drug user in
prison, or we can provide treatment or education for more than
100 people. Which do you think is the better deal? </p>

<h3>Build agreement. </h3>

<p> Sales people know that a person is more likely to agree with
you if they have already agreed with you. That is, if you can get
them to agree that it is a nice day, for example, they will be
more likely to agree with whatever else you may say. You get them
in the habit of saying &quot;Yes&quot; and they will keep saying
&quot;Yes.&quot; </p>

<p> There are certain issues on which nearly everyone will
readily agree. The first is that people who are sick should get
whatever medicine they need. If they understand that marijuana
can help save the lives of people with AIDS and cancer, and that
heroin can help relieve extreme chronic pain, and may even speed
healing after surgery or injury, they will usually agree that --
for medical purposes at least -- we should allow the use of these
drugs. Then point out: </p>

<p> Sick people are suffering and dying because they need these
medicines to live. If that was the only reason to re-examine our
drug policy it would be reason enough. But, as you know, it is
not the only reason to re-examine what we are doing. Isn't it
time to examine all these problems and see what really is the
right thing to do? </p>

<h3>Attack the very foundations of the drug laws. </h3>

<p> The drug laws were the product of racism and ignorance. They
never did have anything to do with public health and safety. It
is important that people understand this point. Most people
wrongly assume that the drug laws were passed because it was
necessary to protect people against dangerous drugs. Most people
do not know that, at the time the laws were passed, there was no
medical evidence to show that these drugs were dangerous, and
that major newspapers like the New York Times published articles
with titles like &quot;Negro Cocaine Fiends, New Southern
Menace.&quot; Once people begin to understand that there never
was a good reason for the laws in the first place, then it is
perfectly legitimate to ask what is the reason for these laws
now. </p>

<p> This can lead to a discussion of how the drug laws came to be
(your opponent loses by default); or the fact that half of all
our prison inmates are black, most of them there on drug charges;
or the fact that in places like Washington, DC, ninety percent of
all the black men have already been to jail, most of them on drug
charges (your opponent loses by embarrassment). </p>

<h3>One standard response </h3>

<p> The following sentence works for nearly anything your
opponent may say: </p>

<p> <b>&quot;There is no evidence to support that assertion.
Every major study of drug policy agreed that, even if it was
true, decriminalization would still be a better solution.&quot;</b>
</p>

<p> For example, they may say that, if drugs are legalized that
everyone will become drug addicts. You say: </p>

<p> &quot;There is no evidence to support that assertion. Every
major study of drug policy agreed that, even if drug use did
increase, decriminalization would still be a better
solution.&quot; </p>

<h3>Preface your sentences </h3>

<p> Put a prefix in front of your sentences. The prefix is <b>&quot;Every
major study agreed . . .&quot;</b> Without this phrase, the
things you say will be interpreted as your own opinion. If you
use this phrase, your opinions are seen more clearly as the
overwhelming weight of the evidence. Also, this phrase will force
your opponent to debate on the basis of fact, where they are the
weakest, and will quickly flatten their best arguments. </p>

<h3>Attack, Attack, Attack. </h3>

<p> It is the only way you will win. Even if people believed that
legalization was right, they would still support the current set
of laws because they aren't certain about legalization and
believe the criminal laws do no harm. They must be made to see
that the current laws are worse than no laws at all. You must put
your opponents on the extreme defensive and keep them there. Make
them justify all of the awful facts. The subject is not
legalization or decriminalization. The subject is prison. </p>

<h3>Keep it short and punchy. </h3>

<p> Know what you are going to say and trim every excess word. If
you are really lucky you will get a full fifteen minutes of media
air time to explain everything there is to know about drugs. Hit
the major facts as rapidly as you can. </p>

<h3>Memorize what you want to say </h3>

<p> Salesmen memorize their sales pitch because, once they have
it down by rote, they can say it without even thinking, thus
freeing their tactical brain to get an edge on their prospect.
With tricky subjects like drug policy reform it is very easy to
make verbal missteps which will weaken your case, or send your
audience into extreme cognitive dissonance (a mental shutdown)
where they will not hear another thing you say. Be extremely
careful about the phrasing you use and stick with the phrasing
which will keep you out of trouble. Memorize the names of the
studies so you can spit them out without thinking. </p>

<h3>Stick to the issue. </h3>

<p> Don't let the discussion stray into related social issues.
Drug policy is one of those issues which is closely intertwined
with other issues such as morality, education, health care,
welfare, and many others. Don't get sidetracked into arguments
over welfare reform or some other complicated issue You don't
have time for it and most Americans don't have the brain capacity
to understand the complexities anyway. The issue is whether
building massive prisons will solve the drug problem. </p>

<h3>Get the facts out. </h3>

<p> Most people do not know the actual statistics on things like
drug deaths, the number of people in prison, the percentage of
black men who will go to prison and the plight of medical
patients who cannot get these medicines. When they hear the
facts, they really begin to wonder about the current policy. </p>

<h3>Win by inches. </h3>

<p> Don't try to bring people too far in their thinking. The
concept of legalization or decriminalization is a big
intellectual and emotional stretch for a lot of people and you
could easily spend years getting them to fully believe it. It is
simply not practical, or necessary, to try to bring people over
to the legalization side all at once. People will naturally come
to the legalization point of view if you can simply convince them
that our current policy is a disaster which could never work (and
that is really easy!). Once they agree that the current policy is
not working, and cannot work, then they will ask themselves -- if
prisons don't work, what should we do? When they confront this
question, they have started down the slippery slope to
decriminalization. </p>

<p> Federal Judge Jack B. Weinstein said, &quot;Unthinking
acceptance of the current drug policy is unreasonable.&quot; If
we can just get people to admit that there is a real problem with
what we are doing now, and that we must look for a better
solution, they will eventually agree with you. </p>

<p> An interesting thing happened to Judge James P. Gray. A man
wrote Judge Gray a letter in which he started out by telling
Judge Gray how wrong Judge Gray was about legalization. The guy
tried to tell Judge Gray why he was so wrong and, in the space of
three written pages, wound up realizing that Judge Gray was
right. He convinced himself once he just sat down and thought
about it. </p>

<h3>Take the moral high ground </h3>

<p> Our opponents like to take the stance that anyone who does
not believe in huge prisons full of drug dealers is less than
moral, beneath contempt, and is probably selling drugs to
grade-school children in their spare time. It is time to tear
down this moral charade. </p>

<p> There is nothing moral about incarcerating most of the black
men in America. There is nothing moral about denying legitimate
medicines to people who are suffering and dying. There is nothing
moral about a drug policy which seeks to destroy people, not heal
them. The damage being done by this policy is too great to allow
anyone to maintain the pretense that this drug war is something
holy and moral. </p>

<h1>Don'ts </h1>

<h3>Don't use the &quot;L&quot; word, the &quot;D&quot; word, or
the &quot;M&quot; word. </h3>

<p> Don't use &quot;legalization,&quot;
&quot;decriminalization,&quot; or &quot;medicalization&quot;.
These words tend to set some people's heads on fire. In the first
place, these words will cause many people to go into an immediate
complete mental shut-down and they will not hear another thing
you say. In the second place, it is wrong to reduce what must
necessarily be a complex policy under any circumstances, to a
single word. It only serves to further distort the issue.
Besides, you don't have to use the words to win. </p>

<p> Some people have mentioned that the word
&quot;legalization&quot; must be used sooner or later in the
public debate simply because a recognition that prison is wrong
will lead people to consider the alternatives, which will
ultimately lead to prison. This is certainly true. However, I
would recommend that you let your opponent use it first, and that
you do not promote it as a cause. </p>

<h3>Don't defend the use of drugs. </h3>

<p> Don't tell people that everyone has a God-given right to put
whatever they want to in to their body. You may be right, and I
happen to agree, but it won't play in Peoria. Many people just
view this as an excuse to get loaded (and, in many cases, they
are right). </p>

<h3>Don't advance your own plan for selling drugs. </h3>

<p> Do not discuss your personal plan for how legalization would
work The reasons are: </p>

<p> a) You can only sell one product at a time. First convince
them <u>whether</u> we should change the laws. We will have
plenty of time for <u>how</u> later. </p>

<p> b) When you suggest how it should be done then your
individual ideas become the focus. If your plan fails for any
reason, then your whole argument will fail, and; </p>

<p> c) The real secret is that there is no right answer to drug
policy. Every idea you will suggest is only the lesser of
multiple evils and leaves you open to violent emotional attack. </p>

<h3>Don't get tied up in debates over the health risks. </h3>

<p> First let me state that the evidence is quite clear that, by
any standard of comparison, alcohol and tobacco are far more
dangerous than almost any of the illegal drugs. However, the
relative health risks are not really the issue. </p>

<p> Just because something is dangerous does not automatically
mean that the best approach to those dangers is to throw millions
of people in prison. We all know that tobacco, and alcohol, and
AIDS are hazardous to your health. But we all would agree that
prison is not the best public policy for those hazards. Prison,
in fact, would be a terrible mistake. </p>

<p> It is the same principle with illegal drugs. We can assume
that drugs are dangerous. That is not the question. The question
is: What is the best public policy for those dangers? On this
question, every major study of drug policy has agreed that,
whatever the dangers may be, prison is the wrong approach. Every
major study recommended decriminalization <u>because</u> of those
dangers, and because prison is the worst approach. Bigger prisons
do not equal better public health policy. </p>

<h3>Don't get stuck on questions which cannot be answered. </h3>

<p> Congressman Charles Rangel likes to ask the question,
&quot;How do you propose that we go about legalizing drugs?
Should we have crack stores next to liquor stores?&quot; The
trick is that there really is no perfect answer, and any answer
you give leaves you open to attack. It turns the issue into one
of your personal social ideas rather than the objective truth
that all studies agree that decriminalization, under almost any
scenario, is a better approach. </p>

<h3>Don't Overdose </h3>

<p> I generally avoid mention of overdoses because the word
itself distorts the issue in a very emotional sense. The drug
which produces the most overdoses is alcohol. No one thinks of a
drunk high school kid puking into a toilet as a drug overdose,
even when you point it out to them. Consumers Union found that
there are very few real drug overdoses and none at all for
marijuana. Most of the so-called &quot;overdoses&quot; were
clearly attributable to other causes, such as impurities in the
drugs. </p>

<h3>Don't get the issues stuck between you </h3>

<p> People are more likely to believe you and be persuaded by
what you say if they feel that you share their same basic
concerns, that is, if they feel you are &quot;on their
side.&quot; Always explain you answers in terms of their thoughts
and goals. Your goals are probably the same as theirs anyway --
reducing the harm done by drugs, keeping drugs away from kids,
controlling the social costs of drugs, etc. </p>

<h3>Don't let them have anything. </h3>

<p> There are many, many myths about drugs and drug use. Like for
instance, the old myth that pushers spike marijuana with heroin
and cocaine to get unsuspecting kids hooked. It doesn't happen. <u>Licit
and Illicit Drugs</u> effectively explodes most of these myths.
If your opponent mentions such a myth, jump down his throat and
point out that there is no evidence at all to support what he is
saying. Make them prove it. You can prove what you say, they
can't. </p>

<h3>Don't get stuck on Constitutional issues. </h3>

<p> Issues based on the US Constitution will generally not be
persuasive for a number of reasons: </p>

<ol>
    <li>They are complicated. They require a lot of knowledge of
        history, law, and other subjects which most people,
        including you, are not likely to have. Like any other
        complicated issue, anyone can make long-winded
        discussions go on forever with no clear resolution.
        Complicated arguments are best avoided because they just
        don't win. </li>
</ol>

<ol>
    <li>The people who are likely to agree with you probably
        already agree with you. Many Americans, including some
        intelligent ones, do not understand the protections
        afforded by the Constitution and why they are so
        important. Many people tend to feel that the protections
        of the Constitution were only meant to be given to the
        law-abiding citizens like them and, besides, if innocent
        people are hurt because the police have violated their
        rights, then that is just the price we have to pay for
        law and order. It is pointless to argue with these people
        on this point because, for the most part, you are not
        going to change their basic attitude about it. </li>
</ol>

<ol>
    <li>Even if you win, you don't win anything. Even if you get
        your opponent to agree that Fourth Amendment rights (or
        some other rights) are being violated by the police, it
        can be dismissed as simple bad management. That is, they
        will argue that we should manage it a little better, but
        we still ought to continue the war on drugs.
        Constitutional arguments in general do not effectively
        address the point that the drug war is morally and
        practically wrong at its very foundations. </li>
</ol>

<h2>What This Document Is </h2>

<p>In August, 1994, the Drug Enforcement Administration held a
special conference to try to deal with the fact that they were
getting beaten -- badly -- every time they tried to come out for
a drug policy debate. In the last few years, they have been
beaten in these debates so often that it is really an
embarrasment to the whole drug warrior crew. They don't have a
single argument which stands up to close scrutiny. </p>

<p>The reason they were getting beaten is because people began
using the Persuasive Strategies and they got better educated on
the issue. As a result of the Persuasive Strategies being used by
large numbers of people across the US, they were getting publicly
hammered every time they came out for a debate. It was really an
embarrassing trend, so they had to try to do something about it. </p>

<p>Now they have laid out, in detail, their ten biggest arguments
on the issues raised in the debate. These arguments will now be
laid to rest. </p>

<p>Because their book was in large part a response to my
Persuasive Strategies, I have undertaken to write a reply to
their book. In short, they still don't have a single argument
which stands up to close scrutiny. The debate is over and it is
time for them to admit it. </p>

<h1>How to Approach the Black Community </h1>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p> There have been many people who have rightly criticized the
fact that the drug policy reform movement has not made major
allies in the black community - despite the fact that the black
community is clearly the most severely impacted by the drug war.
Instead, the reaction in the black community is often one of even
greater calls for law enforcement presence and even greater
support for the drug war. </p>

<p> While this is largely true, it is simply a matter that most
black people (like most white people) don't realize how we got to
where we are today with the drug problem. As soon as it is
explained in terms that are relevant and understandable to them,
they readily understand and agree with the need for reform -
specifically, not putting nearly so many people in prison. </p>

<p> I have always found it relatively easy to get black people,
particularly black leaders, to support drug policy reform. They
will not support &quot;legalization&quot;, but they will support
specific steps of reform which both they and the
&quot;legalizers&quot; agree are necessary. They already have a
problem with too many liquor stores in their communities, so they
will not support ideas which look like you are going to open up a
legal chain of crack houses. They can be expected to argue for
the point that we simply need to stop and look at what we are
doing, and seriously question the whole program. They will also
support and argue for constructive, rather than destructive
approaches to the problem. </p>

<p> Ultimately, many black leaders will tell you privately that
they support &quot;legalization&quot;, if they are just given the
facts as a basis for their view. However, they will still have a
significant problem with the public presentation. One church
leader told us that his church had once issued a health kit which
included various first aid items, educational materials, phone
numbers to call, a lot of other things, and a condom. He said
there was a storm of controversy about nothing but the condom and
they eventually had to take it out of the package because they
were spending all their time explaining it and defending it to
people, so they couldn't get anything else done. They ultimately
figured that it would be better to distribute the same package
with everything but the condom. It is sad, but it is a functional
reality of the community they live in. It is one task to persuade
them of the need for reform. It is another task to help them find
ways that they can address the issue with their own community. </p>

<h2>How to Find Them, Approach Them, and Win Them Over </h2>

<ol>
    <li>Do your homework. Be up to date on the latest stats,
        issues, and arguments as they relate to the black
        community. </li>
    <li>Look in the phone book for any churches or other social
        organizations located in, or allied to, the black
        community. </li>
    <li>Call the head of the organization and arrange an
        appointment. Most of them, particularly churches, will
        give you one if you just ask. </li>
    <li>Be prepared with charts, graphs, statistics, historical
        information, and reference sources, so you have an
        interesting and persuasive presentation. </li>
    <li>Cover the racial origins of the laws, with appropriate
        citations and quotes. </li>
    <li>Cover the current situation with black men, <u>including
        the lifetime risk of prison for black men</u> - and how
        the probability of a drug conviction relates to that
        total risk. </li>
    <li>Don't expect them to trust white people. After the last
        200 years, they are justified in being a little
        suspicious at times. Ask them to trust themselves and
        check everything you say. Then give them the reference
        sources to do it. </li>
    <li>Don't use the &quot;L&quot; word, the &quot;D&quot; word,
        or the &quot;M&quot; word. Use the &quot;R&quot; word -
        Reform - in terms that are specific to the concerns of
        the black community. Talk about constructive (treatment
        and education) rather than destructive (prison)
        approaches to the drug problem. </li>
    <li>They know that you (like most of those goody-good white
        people who come down to meddle in their community) are
        going to be gone tomorrow and not living with the
        consequences of whatever takes place in their community.
        Your arguments must, at all times, be expressed in terms
        which are meaningful and relevant to them. </li>
    <li>Understand their position. They CANNOT be seen as
        promoting or condoning drug use in any way at all. If you
        tell them you support the right of everyone to get
        loaded, you will find yourself in the parking lot in a
        matter of seconds. </li>
    <li>Remember that the Christian belief is very strong in the
        black community (though they do tend to have a somewhat
        more vigorous approach to their religion than those
        stuffy white people). The argument about what Jesus would
        do - build bigger prisons, or build hospitals and schools
        - will strike a resonant chord with many of them.
        Contrast love, compassion, and healing, with punishment,
        prison, and destruction. </li>
    <li>Help them to find a way to talk about it publicly. The
        issue of the disparity in the sentencing, and the sheer
        numbers of black men going to prison alone means that we
        should <b>AT LEAST </b>back up and take an honest look at
        what we are doing in the drug war. We must build, not
        destroy. And we must examine the entire drug war, not
        just the crack laws. </li>
    <li>Get them involved in our alliance. Get them connected to
        the Internet, if possible, (usually not possible), or get
        them on the mailing lists of the relevant organizations.
        Find someone from their group who will take the
        initiative in maintaining and responding to
        communications. </li>
    <li>Tell them about the online library and the fact that it
        has large amounts of information about the racial roots
        of the drug war, as well as other information. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Questions </h2>

<p> I have listed below, a number of the common questions which
will come up in such an interview, whether they are explicitly
stated or not. </p>

<h3>What is their biggest concern? </h3>

<p> Their biggest single concern at this point is the ongoing
massive destruction of black men. Black men are being rendered
&quot;economically dead&quot; by the massive imposition of prison
sentences. Their point of view may be somewhat skewed, in that
they may view this as a result of the drugs, not the laws, and it
may not have occurred to them that, as bad as drugs are, criminal
punishment is not the way to address the problem. </p>

<h3>Why did this white boy come all the way over here to tell
this to me? </h3>

<p> Because I am concerned about the drug war for my own reasons,
and I have the good sense to recognize that there are other
people who would also have concerns, for their own reasons. We
will both achieve better results if we work together toward
common goals. And, just as a matter of common sense and common
decency, I think it is pretty stupid to lock up half of all the
black men in America. There has to be a better way. </p>

<h3>Why should I trust you? </h3>

<p> Don't trust me. Trust yourself. I will simply give you a
point of view and the evidence which I think firmly supports it.
I think the evidence will shock you, but I don't ask you to
believe it. I will give you the reference sources where I got it,
and I encourage you to do your own research and let me know of
any facts or issues that I have missed. My strongest allies have
always come from the people who went to the library and verified
what I said. </p>

<h3>Why should black people support drug policy reform? </h3>

<ol>
    <li>Because the drug problem is tearing up the black
        community and we need to find a better approach -
        whatever it may be. </li>
    <li>Because the drug laws were based on racism from their
        inception, so there is no reason to expect them to be
        balanced and productive laws today. </li>
    <li>Because every major study of drug policy said that this
        policy only caused more harm than good, particularly for
        poor communities. </li>
    <li>Because it is what Jesus would do. </li>
    <li>Because we want to rebuild black men and make them
        productive citizens, not destroy them. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Are you asking me to support legalization? </h3>

<p> Not at all. I am asking you to recognize the simple
proposition that prison has become a bigger threat to black men
than the drugs themselves. Black men can, and do, recover from
drug problems and go on to live productive lives. They have a
much harder time recovering from a long stretch in prison. We
need to discourage drug use but we do not need to destroy their
lives in order to save them. </p>

<h3>But some of these guys are dangerous and need to be locked
up! </h3>

<p> I fully admit that there are a good number of black men out
there who are dangerous and should be locked up for the good of
society. But we have now reached the point where about half of
all the young black men in America will have spent at least one
stretch in prison before they are thirty. I find it hard to
believe that we have to lock up half of all the young black men
in America for the good of society. Whenever the numbers get that
large, we must stop and ask ourselves if this is really the best
course of action. </p>

<h3>Don't we need some jails? </h3>

<p> Certainly we do. But we learned long ago that, as bad as
alcohol is, Prohibition only caused more problems than it solved.
In the current situation, we can use our money to put one more
black man in prison, or we can use the same amount of money to
provide education or treatment to more than one hundred black
men. Suppose that someone gave us the decision on where we should
spend the next million dollars of tax money on this problem -
what should we do? Should we provide education and treatment for
up to two hundred people, or should we put two more drug dealers
in jail? </p>

<h3>How can I speak about this publicly? </h3>

<ol>
    <li>Talk about the terrible damage being done by not only the
        crack laws, but the drug laws in general. The crack laws
        are the worst example, but they are only one small part
        of a bigger system that is severely impacting black men. </li>
    <li>Talk about the need for education and treatment, not
        prison. Talk about the need for responses to the problem
        which build people rather than destroy them. </li>
    <li>Talk about the racial roots of the drug laws - how these
        laws were built on racism from their very inception, and
        how the image of the Negro Cocaine Fiend in 1914 is
        repeated in the image of the crack-fiend today. </li>
    <li>Talk about the need for an open and honest investigation
        of this entire drug problem - not just the mandatory
        minimums for crack. It is the entire drug policy which is
        wrong and it is the entire drug policy which must be
        fairly, openly, and honestly investigated. </li>
</ol>

<H1>Answers to Specific Arguments on Drug Legalization</H1>

<P>
by Clifford A. Schaffer
<H1><IMG SRC="../graphics/blueline.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> </H1>

<H3>If we legalize/decriminalize drugs then everyone will become
drug addicts. </H3>

<P>
Every major study of drug policy agreed that there is no evidence
to support this belief and, even if drug use did increase, decriminalization
would still be a better approach. In Europe, several countries
have decriminalized drugs and actually seen a significant drop
in drug use.
<H3>We need a combined approach of education, treatment, prevention,
and stiff law enforcement. </H3>

<P>
This is a smoke screen, designed to cloud the issue and make your
opponent seem like they are taking the most rational, balanced
approach while you are the one who is suggesting the extremist
measures. Don't let them get away with it. You can kick all of
their extraneous arguments out of the way and refocus the issue

<P>
We agree one hundred percent on education, treatment, and prevention.
The only place where we part company is on prisons. My opponent
wants to build prisons larger than the Nazi concentration camps
of World War II. I don't think that is necessarily a good idea.
<H3>We have to keep these drugs illegal to protect our children.
</H3>

<P>
I agree. That's why I am looking for a better solution -- because
what we are doing now is obviously not working. In fact, the current
policy is one of the main reasons that drug users find it profitable
to get kids involved in drugs and distribute drugs free on school
campuses. I believe that we can find a better approach which would
stop this.
<H3>My son/daughter was turned into a psycho by drugs so we have
to stamp out this evil menace. </H3>

<P>
(Keep in mind that the person who says this kind of thing is probably
under tremendous emotional stress so it would not be polite or
productive to suggest that their kid was probably a psycho all
along. Keep a gentle, sympathetic demeanor.)
<P>
We have made these drugs as illegal as they can be and these kinds
of tragedies still happen. The fact that your son/daughter became
a victim of these drugs shows, in itself, that the current policy
did not work for you and your family. All it really does is to
make it harder to provide treatment for the people who need it.
I believe that there may be a better way to handle the problem,
that just might have saved your son/daughter. Don't you think
that we should at least explore the possibility of a better way
to handle the problem?
<P>
Or:
<P>
What happened to your child is certainly a tragedy. But tell me,
would your child have been better off if they spent twenty years
in prison? 
<H3>I used to be a junkie until I was saved from the life of evil
and I know that drugs should not be legalized! </H3>

<P>
1) It is illegal now and that didn't stop you. All it really does
is keep most people from getting help sooner because we are spending
all of our money on prisons and we cannot provide adequate treatment.
<P>
2) Would you be better off if you had spent twenty years in prison?
If we really did it the way you are suggesting, you would still
be in prison and would not be here to talk to me.
<H3>You just want to legalize it -- you commie scum! </H3>

<P>
Of course, I have my own ideas about what might be a good solution
to the problem, but that is not the point. The point is that we
need to bring all of our best minds together to consider your
ideas for a better solution, as well as mine. The only way that
we will ever find a better approach is by an open and honest discussion
of the evidence and all of the possible approaches to the problem.

<H3>They tried this in Europe with Needle Park and it didn't work
so they are going back to throwing people in prison. </H3>

<P>
Absolutely not true. Europe, in general, is committed to decriminalization
and we invite anyone to talk to the law enforcement officials
in Rotterdam, Amsterdam, or Liverpool, and see for themselves.
There have been some policies which the European officials admit
did not work as well as others, such as Needle Park, but they
are still committed to a non-criminal approach to drugs. In addition,
England, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Germany, and Colombia have
all taken steps toward the legalization or decriminalization of
drugs. In addition, both the head of Interpol and the British
Association of Chiefs of Police have called for an end to drug
prohibition.
<H3>What do <U>you</U> think we should do about drugs? </H3>

<P>
I have my own ideas about what might be a good solution to the
problem, but that is not the point, because I don't have all the
answers and nobody else does either. The point is that we need
to bring all of our best minds together to consider your ideas
for a better solution, as well as mine. The only way that we will
ever find a better approach is by an open and honest discussion
of the evidence and all of the possible approaches to the problem.

<P>
For starters, we might just take the recommendations of any major
study of drug policy that you like and start from there. (Then
hand them a list of the studies of drug policy.)
<H3>Well, why don't we legalize murder, and robbery, and all the
other crimes, and then we won't have a crime problem. </H3>

<P>
Drug use and murder are not the same in any sense so this is a
silly comparison to begin with. But let's consider this arguments
on its merits. There are about 25,000 homicides in the United
States each year, and there are about thirty million people who
use illegal drugs.
<P>
If we had thirty million murderers or robbers, we would have to
find another way to deal with the problem, simply because the
criminal justice system could not handle the load. This is the
case with the drug problem. It doesn't matter whether we want
to put all the drug users or dealers in prison, it simply is not
possible to do it by any stretch of the imagination.
<P>
But that avoids the real issue. The real issue is what is the
most effective way to deal with the problem. Even if we all agree
that drugs are bad, all of the evidence states that prison only
makes the problem worse.
<H3>We should make all the drug users get treatment and put all
the drug dealers in jail. </H3>

<P>
Let's suppose I agree with you one hundred percent and I will
run out right now and place the order for the new prison cells
we will need. Now, please tell me, exactly how many prison cells
will we need to build to carry out your plan?
<P>
If they say:
<P>
I don't know.
<P>
That is precisely the problem. No one has ever thought it through
as to what it will take to succeed with prison.
<H3>Aren't you really promoting drug use? </H3>

<P>
Not at all, and let me give you example. I personally think that
cigars are one of the most disgusting things I have ever encountered.
They are addictive, dangerous to the health of the smoker and
the people around them, and they smell awful. I will do everything
I reasonably can to keep people from smoking them in my presence,
and to encourage them to quit. However, at the same time, I have
the good sense to recognize that it would not accomplish anything
to throw George Burns in jail.
<H3>We can't legalize drugs because it would send the wrong message
to our children. </H3>

<P>
How many millions of people should we put in prison to send just
the right message? 
<P>
Is this really the best way you can think of to send a message
to children? If you can't do any better than that, perhaps we
should be spending our money on some simple courses in basic communication
or child-rearing.
<H3>We have so many problems with alcohol and tobacco already.
Why do you want to add to that? </H3>

<P>
Maybe you missed something. These drugs are already here. Even
the DEA admits that it has never had a significant impact on the
drug markets at any time. It is a not a question of adding to
anything. It is a question of finding the most effective way to
deal with a problem we already have.

<h2>Pot (Drugs) are Dangerous - How to Deal with the Argument </h2>

<p> <strong>by Clifford A. Schaffer</strong> </p>

<p> You have heard the argument before: </p>

<p> <strong>Pot is dangerous. It causes cancer, auto accidents,
grows hair on your palms, and makes you go blind.</strong> </p>

<p> This is a guide on how to deal with this argument in all
sorts of easy ways. Some of these arguments were developed during
debates with doctors, so some of them assume that the opponent is
a doctor. </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">General
Discussion </h3>

<p> First, it is generally pointless to get tied up in debating
the details of health issues or, in general, any supposed danger
of drugs. The reason is that you get so wound up in trading
scientific references that you never get to the real bottom line
-- prison. Dr. So-and-So (who the audience doesn't know anyway)
says X, Dr. Whositt, says Y -- so what? </p>

<p> Net result -- you convince nobody. Once you have won your
main point, and established that criminal punishment is not an
effective approach to the problem -- no matter what you have
assumed about the dangers -- then you can go back and, at your
leisure, knock down their health evidence as well. </p>

<p> My approach -- conceding all their evidence up front -- does
a complete end run. They expect me to argue that pot doesn't
cause cancer, etc. When I don't, and jump to the bottom line
policy issue (prison), they are completely disarmed. They really
don't know what to do. They never thought about their logical
non-sequitir (Because XXXXX is dangerous, therefore prison is the
solution) and are completely unprepared to deal with arguments
which address the logical disconnect. Once they are sitting there
with a stunned expression on their face -- knowing they have been
completely cut off -- then I come back with the mop up campaign
of addressing the health risks and comparing them with other
health risks for which we do not put people in jail. By that
time, they will be doing little but nodding their head and
agreeing. </p>

<p> I remember one debate in which my opponent showed up with a
whole stack of medical references on the harmful effects of
drugs. A few minutes into the debate he closed his folder and
never opened it again. Of course, as always, he conceded and
agreed with me. </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">The
Specific Responses </h3>

<p> Now for the specific responses: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Ok, you convinced me. Let's assume everything you say is
        true and it grows hair on your palms besides. How many
        millions of people do you suppose we ought to throw in
        prison for best results? </li>
    <li>Let's assume all the evidence you presented is 100
        percent accurate. The evidence you presented shows that
        pot is perhaps three times as carcinogenic as cigarettes.
        What does this mean in terms of policy? Does it mean that
        the penalties for pot should be three times the penalties
        for cigarettes? Then, of course, there should be even
        higher penalties for cigars and chewing tobacco, right? </li>
    <li>So the argument is XXXXXX causes cancer. Therefore, the
        law is really based on trying to prevent people from
        doing things which might give them cancer, right? Should
        we have laws against staying out in the sun too long,
        eating cheeseburgers, or smoking tobacco? </li>
    <li>The reasons you have stated never did have anything to do
        with why the laws were passed in the first place. Please
        answer two questions: Why were the drug laws passed in
        the first place? When did the concerns over cancer become
        the reason behind the laws? </li>
    <li>If your concern is really the carcinogens, then we can
        just require that the active ingredient be distributed in
        its pure form. Or what if someone only uses it by
        distilling the active ingredient (a simple process) and
        thereby takes no carcinogens? Shouldn't they be free from
        penalties? </li>
    <li>Gosh, you convinced me. Let's solve the problem right
        away. We will elect you King so you can do _anything_ you
        want. And ... every pot smoker in America is lined up
        outside your door with a bag of dope in one hand and a
        signed confession in the other. Now what? </li>
    <li>Every major study of drug policy agreed that prohibition
        only multiplied the bad effects which already exist with
        drugs. For example, overdoses become more likely because
        users don't know what they are getting; there are no
        standards for drug purity so there is greater harm from
        contaminants, addicts are less likely to receive
        effective treatment, etc. The more you assume about the
        harmful effects of drugs, the more imperative it becomes
        to address them in a non-criminal manner. </li>
    <li>Your evidence states that pot may be a problem while
        driving. Let's assume (for the sake of argument) that
        this is true. Do we attempt to solve the problem of drunk
        driving by throwing wine and beer drinkers in jail? Why
        not? (Can you say &quot;misapplication of
        resources&quot;?) </li>
    <li>The argument that pot was found in the bloodstreams of
        any group of people who died from any cause is not
        indicative of anything other than that they might have
        used pot some time within the last two months before they
        died. It does not say anything about all the people who
        may have pot in their bloodstreams and still be alive and
        well. It doesn't even say anything about _why_ they died.
        For comparison purposes, as any competent doctor knows,
        we need control groups. </li>
    <li>We must be wary of false comparisons (as any competent
        doctor should know). For example, we had one previous
        example in which large numbers of people were dying with
        pot in their bloodstreams. It was called Vietnam. Pot
        smokers had a high death rate, but it had nothing to do
        with pot. </li>
    <li>Pot causes cancer. Therefore, the best approach to the
        problem is to put millions of people in prison. This is
        the basic argument. Can you say &quot;non-sequitir&quot;?
        Where did you get the idea that if something is a health
        hazard, we ought to throw people in prison? </li>
    <li>Name all the other health problems for which prison is
        the recommended treatment. </li>
    <li>Please make a list of the comparable health problems
        caused by say, alcohol, and then match the health
        problems with the appropriate criminal penalties. </li>
    <li>Then maybe you can tell me why every major study of drug
        policy in the last fifty years recommended
        decriminalization. (See the list of Biggest Studies of
        Drug Policy on my web page.) </li>
    <li>You know, we can dispense with all the details and cut to
        the bottom line. Rather than argue the details of what it
        <strong>_might_</strong> cause, we can take a look at the
        actual stats on what it <strong>_does_</strong> cause.
        When we look at the official stats, such as deaths from
        any pot-related cause, the numbers are trivial in
        comparison with the damage done by alcohol and tobacco.
        We are spending 99 percent of our budget on one percent
        of the real drug problems. </li>
</ol>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">If Your
Opponent is a Doctor </h3>

<p> 16) Hey, Doc! What is the first rule of addressing a health
problem? First, do no harm. Right? Putting people in prison does
significant harm long before they are likely to get cancer. </p>

<p> If my opponent is a doctor I will hammer him on points just
like the one above. If he is really concerned about pot as a
health issue then, by God, he ought to be ready to address that
part of the problem as he would any other health issue. Would he
put people in prison for non-marital sex in order to prevent
venereal disease? Obviously he wouldn't. Hit him with his own
values and evidence. </p>

<p> And, if he is a doctor, I would hammer him repeatedly on the
fact that he really didn't know anything about the subject. Like:
</p>

<p> So tell me why the Consumers Union Report on Licit and
Illicit Drugs said that prohibition was the worst thing we could
do for drug-related health problems. You haven't read it have
you? The big problem here is ignorance, Doctor. It is one thing
to read some medical literature about the harm these things can
do and it is quite another to make the leap to an effective
public policy. Your problem, Doctor, is that you have read some
of the medical evidence but haven't read the evidence on drug
policy. Ignorance is a shameful thing in someone with as much
education as you have. </p>

<p> In short, if I am in a debate with a doctor, he will fall
before I am done -- because he is a doctor. I will goad him into
reading the CU Report by taunting him, calling him ignorant,
cajoling him, or anything else I have to do. I will force him to
either read what I have read or look like a public fool. Once
they read it, they always concede. For example, see my much
earlier post &quot;Cliff Converts Doc&quot;. It was written by a
doctor who fought me tooth and nail and then wound up telling
everyone that I was right. Excerpts of my debate with him are
posted on my web page. <br>

Stopper Questions for Your Opponent </p>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> These are the questions that drug warriors are simply unable
to answer. They stop them cold every time. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> Please keep in mind with all of these questions that your
opponents will try their best to squirm out of an answer. If you
are talking to a politician, they will typically try to put out a
ten-minute smoke screen and hope no one recognizes that they
never did answer the question. If they try the smoke screen, try
the approach listed under <b>Smokescreen</b>: </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">How many
millions of people do you think we ought to put prison for drugs
to have the best results? </h3>

<p> I have asked many people this question over the years. It is
at that point that they usually fall out of the debate. No one
can answer this question with anything that makes any sense,
except zero. The first, and most obvious thing they do, is to try
to talk their way around it. This is not an essay question. </p>

<p> According to various estimates there are at least twelve
million regular users of illegal drugs, and possibly as many as
forty million. We now have about 1.5 million people in prisons
and jails across the country, and all the jail cells are already
full. It is immediately obvious to everyone that we cannot afford
to put forty million people in prison, even if it was a good
idea. In fact, we cannot afford to put twelve million people in
jail, either. </p>

<p> Most people, when asked this question, will immediately back
off of the idea that we should put drug users in prison, simply
because it is obvious that there is no way we could jail enough
of them to make a dent in the problem. &quot;Just send the drug
dealers to prison.&quot; they will say. </p>

<p> &quot;OK,&quot; I ask. &quot;How many do you suppose there
are?&quot; </p>

<p> They usually don't know, so you have to lead them a little
bit. Under the law, all drug users are technically dealers
because anyone who ever passed a joint to another person at a
rock concert is considered a &quot;drug distributor&quot;. Under
most state laws, it matters little what the context was, or
whether the person received any profit from passing the joint to
the next person. So, potentially, that would mean we would
imprison up to forty million people -- obviously impossible. </p>

<p> Therefore, we determine that we can't go by the current legal
definition of a drug dealer, but we would have to make a
requirement that we only go after those who are really in the
regular business of selling drugs, either on a part-time, or
full-time basis. If we assume that about ten percent of the users
are &quot;dealers&quot; by this definition (a fair estimate),
that would mean that there are somewhere between 1.2 million and
4 million drug dealers. In order to succeed then, we would have
to build up to four prisons and jails for every one which now
exists -- and hope that solved the problem. </p>

<p> One person, ex-DEA agent Michael Levine suggested that we
just jail the hard core drug users, a number he estimated at
about 2.7 million. I asked him if he really thought it was a good
idea to build two or three prisons for every one which now
exists, jail almost three million more people, and hope that
would solve the problem. It seemed to me obvious that it
wouldn't, since it would leave between ten and forty million
casual drug users to go about their business. </p>

<p> A few won't back off and will insist that we should jail all
forty million people, if we have to. Some have even insisted that
we should also jail another hundred million who indulge in
tobacco or alcohol. These people will look like fools in front of
the vast majority of audiences, and just cause most people to
come over to the side of reform. </p>

<h4>Their Answer </h4>

<p> Any answer to this question is bound to be wrong. If they
mention a low number, point out that we already have hundreds of
thousands of people in prison for illegal drugs and millions have
been arrested and prosecuted. That obviously did not stamp out
drugs, so a small increase in the prisoners will not have any
good effect. </p>

<p> <b>A general line of BS.</b> </p>

<p> Drug warriors will do anything they can to get out of
answering the simplest question about our drug policy. Don't let
them get away with evading a direct question. Come back to the
point until they either give you an answer or admit they don't
have a clue. We are embarked on a campaign which is based on the
belief that we can put enough people in prison to effectively
control the drug problem. The question is simple: How many
prisoners is the current plan going to take? </p>

<p> They have asked us, the taxpayers to write a blank check for
prisons. As the people writing the check for these taxes, it is
only fair for us to ask for the amount that is going to go on the
check. Just tell us how many prison cells are going to be
required. </p>

<p> <b>No one knows the answer to that question.</b> </p>

<p> Bull. It is perfectly easy to calculate the number of prison
cells needed to address criminal problems. For example, there are
approximately 25,000 homicides in the US each year which means
that we need a maximum of about 25,000 prison beds to hold the
perpetrators. A similar estimate could be drawn for the number of
robbers, rapists, etc. In all of these cases, the number of
prison cells required to hold the perpetrators is something our
country can manage. This is not the case with the drug laws. </p>

<p> <b>Your question assumes that we will imprison forty million
people.</b> </p>

<p> No, the question doesn't assume anything. I want you to tell
me how many people you think we ought to put in jail, and then
tell me your assumptions. </p>

<p> <b>As many as we have already.</b> </p>

<p> Does that mean you would be willing to end all further drug
arrests beyond the amount we have now? Once the police reach this
quota, should they stop arresting drug offenders because we know
we only have room for so many? </p>

<p> <b>Any number of million.</b> </p>

<p> If they mention five, ten, or twenty million, multiply the
number they mention by $500,000 and tell them the cost of that
approach. For example, the cost to incarcerate 1 million people
is five hundred billion dollars; 2 million is one trillion
Dollars, 10 million is five trillion dollars, and so forth. Then
crucify them for wanting to build prisons larger than the Nazi
concentration camps. </p>

<p> <b>I don't know.</b> </p>

<p> If they say they don't know, then say, &quot;That is
precisely the problem. No one, including you, has ever sat down
to figure it out. If you did, you would find out soon enough that
it is just plain impossible to solve the problem this way.&quot; </p>

<h4>Smokescreen </h4>

<p> Excuse me for interrupting, but that was not an essay
question. The question can be answered with just a simple number.
What will it take, 5 million, 10 million, 20 million? How many
millions of people will have to go to prison to solve the drug
problem this way? </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">For Drug
Enforcement Officers: What would you do if you got your fondest
wish? What would do if, tomorrow morning, you woke up and every
drug user in America was lined up outside your door with a bag of
dope in one hand and a signed confession in the other? </h3>

<p> Their Answer </p>

<p> Their immediate response is usually, &quot;I would arrest
them, of course!&quot; </p>

<p> That is a perfect opportunity to ask &quot;OK, how many do
you suppose there would be? I am just asking because I want to
help you get whatever you need to do the job right.&quot; </p>

<p> That will lead into the general discussion shown in the
previous question. </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">For Devout
Christians: What would Jesus do if we gave this problem to Him?
Would He build bigger prisons? Or would He build hospitals and
schools? </h3>

<p> I usually preface this question by saying, &quot;You are a
better Christian than I am, and you probably know more about
Jesus than I do. So you tell me . . .&quot; Give them credit for
the strength and correctness of their belief. </p>

<p> Their Answer </p>

<p> Most Christians will be stunned by the simplicity and power
of this argument. Most of them will be able to immediately see
the sense behind what we are saying. Some of the immediate
reactions I have gotten from Christians, including ministers,
are: </p>

<p> &quot;When you put it that way, the answer is obvious.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;That's pretty cut and dried, isn't it?&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;Schools and hospitals, obviously.&quot; </p>

<p> Most of the answers will be in that vein. </p>

<p> A few Christians are exceptionally bigoted people and will
insist on hell-fire and damnation for anyone who dares to
transgress their ideas of sin. They are in the definite minority
and the vast majority of people will see their reactions as
extreme. </p>

<p> On one occasion, a prominent minister told me that he thought
perhaps Jesus might build bigger prisons because of the story of
Sodom and Gomorrah. &quot;Correct me if I am wrong,&quot; I said,
&quot;but I believe the story of Sodom and Gomorrah is in the Old
Testament, not the New Testament.&quot; He got the point that the
ministry of Jesus was all about love and healing. </p>

<p> One minister told me that he thought Jesus would build a
certain number of prisons in order to keep the dangerous people
from harming others. &quot;That's probably true,&quot; I said,
&quot;but what about the prisoners -- up to two-thirds of them --
who are there purely for non-violent drug offenses?&quot; </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">I have
here a list of every major study of drug policy in the last fifty
years. Every one of them recommended decriminalization. Do you
agree that the overwhelming weight of the scholarly evidence on
drug policy supports decriminalization? </h3>

<p> Before you answer, let me remind you that there are only
three possible answers to this question. </p>

<p> The first possible answer is yes, you agree. </p>

<p> The second possible answer is no, you do not agree, in which
case you should be able to provide a list of studies of drug
policy comparable in quality and quantity to the list I have
provided. </p>

<p> The third possible answer is that you don't have a clue what
the scholarly evidence says because you have never read the most
basic research on the subject. </p>

<h4>Their Answer </h4>

<p> The answers that I have gotten to this question include: </p>

<p> <b>The scholarly evidence is not important.</b> (From Bob
Martinez, former Drug Czar) </p>

<p> Is the scholarly evidence not important in science, medicine,
and every other field of law? Or is it not important only when it
comes to drug policy? </p>

<p> <b>I don't think anyone really knows the answer.</b> </p>

<p> Can you name any major study of drug policy which supported
what we are currently doing? (They probably can't.) So we have
ten major studies, including the largest studies ever conducted
by the governments of the United States, Britain, and Canada,
which supported decriminalization and none that supported the
current policy. Wouldn't you say that is the overwhelming weight
of the evidence? </p>

<p> <b>Everyone has their list of studies which they can make up
to show anything they want.</b> </p>

<p> OK, so show me any comparable list of studies that you have
in support of the drug war. (So far, in more than six years of
debates, no opponent has ever mentioned a single major study of
drug policy which supports the current drug war.) </p>

<p> <b>I don't have a clue.</b> </p>

<p> That is precisely the problem. You want to tell us what drug
policy should be when you have not even bothered to read the most
basic research on the subject. </p>

<p> <b>Here is a list of studies . . . .</b> </p>

<p> A few people have tried to bluff their way through by citing
studies about organized crime, alcohol, or something else. They
may also cite magazine articles, books by particular authors,
editorials or other opinion pieces, etc. Examine each one
carefully. Is it really a comprehensive study of the history and
facts relating to these drug laws, or is it just one person's
view? Did it consider all evidence and all views? Was it
comprehensive, or was it a simple magazine article of a few
pages? Did the author have an axe to grind or something to gain
from the opinion expressed? Does the work contain a complete
discussion of the history of the laws? Does it consider the laws
in the context of similar facts about tobacco and alcohol? </p>

<p> People have mentioned a lot of different things in response
to this question, but none of them have met the criteria of a
serious study of drug policy. </p>

<h4>Smokescreen </h4>

<p> Excuse me for interrupting, but that was not an essay
question. That was multiple choice. What is your answer; yes, no,
or don't have a clue? </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">It costs
about half a million dollars to put a single drug user in prison,
which includes $150,000 for arrest and prosecution, about
$150,000 for a new prison cell, and about $30,000 per year times
at least five years. For the same cost we can provide treatment
or education for more than one hundred people. Which do you think
is the better deal? </h3>

<p> <b>Their Answer:</b> </p>

<p> Almost no one will attempt to argue that prison for one
person is better than education or treatment for several hundred.
Most often they will say, &quot;It's not that simple, you can't
just say that because you are not going to put one person in
prison that you automatically have the money for treatment or
education.&quot; </p>

<p> You answer: </p>

<p> It IS that simple. Right now, California and several other
states are closing schools, libraries, and medical facilities in
order to build more prisons. The money is being taken from
education and treatment to fund more prisons. <br>

<h1>Fullerton Community College Speech </h1>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> <b>This is one of my typical speeches</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> First, I would like to inform everyone that the real subject
here today is not drug decriminalization, or legalization, or
re-legalization, or anything like that, because we still don't
know if we will ever do any of those things. What is certain is
that, at the current rates of incarceration, we will build the
largest prisons in the world. The issue is prison. It is not up
to us to justify decriminalization. It is up to those who support
the current policy to justify putting millions of people in
prison behind a drug policy which everyone admits cannot work. </p>

<p> One of the reasons that I am here is because of my mother. I
have heard many people say that the crusade against drugs is a
moral issue. William Bennett, our first national Drug Czar, said
that it is important to stamp out drugs because it is the moral
thing to do. I will show you that there is nothing moral about
it. </p>

<p> On April 20, 1992, my mother told me she wanted to die. She
called me that evening and asked me if I would understand if she
committed suicide. My mother is sixty-five years old and she
looks and acts at least ten years younger than her age. She still
works because she enjoys her job. Why then does she want to die? </p>

<p> A few years ago she had a minor operation on her ribs and,
during the operation, some nerves were damaged. It wasn't
anyone's fault, it is just one of the ordinary risks of surgery.
It could happen to anyone. Now the nerves fire constantly, at
near-maximum intensity. She says it feels as if someone is
holding a blowtorch to her ribs -- twenty-four hours a day. She
can no longer wear clothes which touch her skin. She can no
longer walk in a warm spring rain because the pain of a single
raindrop is too much to bear. Something as simple as a hug from
her smallest granddaughter will make her fall to the floor in
tears. </p>

<p> She has spent the last few years traveling across the United
States to find a cure. The doctors have tried a long list of
treatments including surgery, drugs, ointments, electricity, and
many other things. None of them worked very well and many of them
were dangerous. The best of them was a nerve block. The nerve
block required my mother to lay on her stomach while the doctors
injected anesthetic directly into the nerve causing the problem.
The needle had to be placed precisely on the nerve so it usually
had to be moved around for a few minutes to get just the right
spot. It reached the limits of human pain. The pain was so great
that her body rigidly locked up, with her senses overloaded. She
could not scream, breathe, or even see. </p>

<p> On two occasions they punctured her lung with this procedure,
and once they actually stopped her heart. To revive her, they
gave her CPR, which means they had to pound on her ribs. When she
awoke she screamed at them to kill her. She said that she was
bitter for months because they had not let her die when they had
the chance. She has since left written instructions that, if her
heart ever stops again, she is not to be revived. Still, she said
the nerve block is worth it, because it gives her relief for
almost three days and, besides, there is always the chance that
she will luck out and they will kill her again. </p>

<p> Only one treatment has ever worked to ease the pain. That
treatment is morphine. Morphine does not make her into a drug
addict. It does not make her into some kind of mindless zombie.
It does not even make her high. It just allows her to live a
relatively normal life, free from the pain in her side. When
compared with the other available treatments, morphine is the
cheapest, safest, and most effective treatment for her condition.
</p>

<p> He doctors will not give her morphine, for two reasons. The
first reason is that they are afraid she will become addicted. A
study conducted at Johns Hopkins Medical School showed that the
addiction rate for the medical use of morphine was less than
one-half of one percent. Even when patients do become addicted,
morphine addiction can be easily managed in a proper medical
environment, so addiction is not a legitimate medical concern. </p>

<p> The second reason they will not prescribe morphine is that
they are afraid of the drug police. They know that the Drug
Enforcement Administration and the local police can seize their
property and destroy their careers over a single questioned
prescription, and the police do not even have to file criminal
charges to do it. It not only can happen, it does happen. Last
year, the Drug Enforcement Administration sent two doctors to
prison for prescribing Tylenol 3. That is Tylenol with codeine.
Tylenol 3 is a prescription drug in only two countries in the
world, the United States and South Africa, and the United States
is the only country which has ever sent a doctor to prison for
prescribing this common medicine. There are many other cases
where doctors have had their lives and careers ruined over
equally trivial matters. </p>

<p> My mother has mixed emotions when I speak out about her
problem. She says that she really does not want anyone's sympathy
because, since she has had this problem, she has discovered that
there are so many more people who are in worse condition than she
is. Some people with AIDS get this same kind of condition all
over their bodies. Every day of their lives is worse than any
horror movie that you have ever seen. They can't get morphine
either. Seven thousand five hundred people go blind from glaucoma
every year because the best medicine - marijuana - is illegal.
And the list goes on. </p>

<p> There are literally millions of people with chronic pain,
cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, and other conditions for which the safest
and most effective medicine is a drug which is now illegal.
Hundreds of thousands of them violate the drug laws every day
because they need these medicines to live. </p>

<p> On behalf of all of the families affected by AIDS, and
cancer, and glaucoma, and a dozen other diseases, I am here to
tell you that this drug policy is indecent and it must be
stopped. There is nothing moral about a drug policy which makes
sick people choose between prison and death. </p>

<p> Drug policy is a complicated issue and we will not have time
today to resolve all of the points under discussion. In the past
fifty years, however, there have been several occasions when
major commissions have been formed specifically to study the
evidence and the options for drug policy and to make
recommendations. There have been both public and private
commissions, domestic and foreign, performed by people of all
political persuasions from liberals to conservative law-and-order
Republicans, and people who aren't even on our political map.
They all recommended decriminalization. </p>

<p> I would like to read to you some of the studies which have
reached this conclusion: </p>

<p> <u>The LaGuardia Committee Report,</u> commissioned by Mayor
Fiorello LaGuardia, written by the New York Academy of Medicine,
and published by the City of New York in 1944. </p>

<p> <u>The Baroness Wootton Report</u>, published by the
government of the United Kingdom in 1967. </p>

<p> <u>The Report of the Canadian Government Commission of
Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use of Drugs</u>, published by the
Canadian Government in 1969. </p>

<p> <u>Dealing With Drug Abuse: A Report to the Ford Foundation</u>,
published by the Drug Abuse Survey Project in 1972. </p>

<p> <u>The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs</u>,
published by the Editors of Consumer Reports Magazine in 1972.
This is a landmark study, a &quot;must-read&quot;, used as a
basic textbook at major universities. </p>

<p> <u>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and
Drug Abuse</u>, commissioned by President Nixon, and published by
the U.S. Federal Government in 1973. </p>

<p> <u>The Facts About Drug Abuse</u>, published by the United
States Drug Abuse Council in 1980. </p>

<p> <u>An Analysis of Marijuana Policy,</u> published by the
National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences in
1982. </p>

<p> <u>The Report of the California State Research Advisory Panel</u>,
commissioned by the State of California, and published in 1990. </p>

<p> The recommendations in these reports were endorsed by (among
others) the American Medical Association, the American Bar
Association, The American Association for Public Health, the
National Education Association, and the National Council of
Churches. </p>

<p> I might also add that the last two reports of the National
Commission on AIDS have also recommended that we adopt
non-criminal approaches to drug abuse. </p>

<p> We may debate the details of the many issues of drug policy
all day, but one basic fact is undeniable. When all of the issues
and all of the evidence is considered, the overwhelming weight of
the scholarly evidence on drug policy supports decriminalization.
</p>

<p> The first question that we need to ask ourselves is: How did
we get into this mess? Any study of the history of the drug laws
shows that they were based on two primary factors; racism and
ignorance. </p>

<p> You may have wondered why marijuana, heroin, and cocaine are
illegal while other equally dangerous drugs such as tobacco and
alcohol are legal, and even promoted by the Federal Government.
The primary reason is that alcohol and tobacco were associated
with white people while the other drugs were associated --
wrongly -- with people of color. </p>

<p> Opiates were first outlawed because of the fear that Chinese
men were luring white women to their ruin in opium dens. Ruin was
defined not as opium addiction, but as associating with Chinese
men. </p>

<p> In the early years of this century, many of the major
newspapers printed lurid articles about superhuman Negro Cocaine
Fiends who would take large amounts of cocaine which would cause
them to go on a violent sexual rampage and rape white women.
Police departments across the nation switched from .32 caliber
pistols to .38 caliber pistols because as one Police Chief
stated, &quot;Those cocaine niggers sure are hard to kill.&quot;
Newspaper stories of the day told lurid tales of Jewish peddlers
selling cocaine to poor southern blacks. There was also a
movement to ban caffeine for the same reasons. There was no
evidence to back up the myth of the Negro Cocaine Fiend simply
because most black people did not have the money to buy cocaine.
Any black man who did rape a white woman would have had to be
suicidal because in 1905 there were 105 recorded lynchings of
black men for unspecified offenses. </p>

<p> Marijuana was later outlawed largely as a repressive tool
against Mexican laborers who were competing with American workers
for jobs during the Depression. </p>

<p> Racism was one of the primary themes of the campaign against
drugs until the campaigns for civil rights in the 1950's and
1960's made it unacceptable. At that point, the drug warriors
turned to other myths to defend their cause. You have heard some
of those myths today. It is important to remember that many of
the myths you heard today were made up in the 1950's and 1960's
when it began to be apparent that the old myths just wouldn't cut
it any more. These laws never did have anything to do with public
health and safety. </p>

<p> GRAPH </p>

<p> We next need to understand the facts on the issue. My first
graph shows the number of deaths caused by drugs, both legal and
illegal, in the United States in a typical year. </p>

<p> Tobacco kills about 390,000 people. </p>

<p> Alcohol kills about 80,000. </p>

<p> Sidestream smoke from tobacco kills about 50,000 people who
don't even smoke. </p>

<p> Prescription drugs kill at least 10,000. </p>

<p> Cocaine kills about 2,500. </p>

<p> Heroin kills about 2,000. </p>

<p> Aspirin kills about 2,000 </p>

<p> Marijuana kills 0. Even the DEA itself says that there has
not been a recorded death due to marijuana in the history of the
United States. </p>

<p> All of the illegal drugs combined killed about 4,500, or
about one percent of the number killed by tobacco. Tobacco kills
more people every year than all of the people killed by all of
the illegal drugs in the Twentieth Century. More Colombians die
from the effects of American tobacco than the number of Americans
who die from Colombian cocaine. As you may know, tobacco is
heavily subsidized and promoted by the United States Government.
The US Government demands that other countries buy more American
tobacco even while we threaten them with war for sending us their
marijuana and cocaine. </p>

<p> Right now we have about 1.3 million people in prison. More
than 600,000 of them are there for non-violent drug offenses. For
every person who died from illegal drugs last year, one hundred
and fifty people went to prison. Most of them were black men. </p>

<p> You may hear a good deal of take about the dangers of illegal
drugs. First let me state that the medical evidence is very clear
that, by any standard of measurement, alcohol and tobacco are
substantially more dangerous to both the individual and to
society than any of the illegal drugs. We have known this for at
least twenty-five years. This is not to say that use of any drug
is entirely safe. We could safely assume that almost anything we
put into our bodies is going to have some health risk, to a
greater or lesser degree. That is not the issue. </p>

<p> Just because something is hazardous does not automatically
mean that the best approach to those hazards is to throw millions
of people in prison. In fact, every major study of drug policy
has concluded that prison only makes those hazards worse and
increases the damage done to society. As one commission stated,
the more we learn about the dangers of drugs, the more it will
become apparent that massive prisons are a medical and social
disaster. It is precisely because of those health hazards that we
must not send people to prison for drug offenses. </p>

<p> We might win the war on drugs if we could be successful in
one of three areas. </p>

<p> First, we could try to stop the production of drugs in
foreign countries. There is no credible evidence anywhere which
would suggest that we could stop, or even greatly reduce, the
production of drugs in foreign countries. The Federal
government's own evidence shows that this is impossible and it is
a waste of money to try. </p>

<p> Second, we could try to stop drugs at the border. There is no
credible evidence anywhere which would suggest that we could
stop, or even greatly reduce, the flow of drugs across our
border. The Federal government's own evidence shows that this is
impossible and it is a waste of money to try. </p>

<p> Third, we could try to stop the sale of drugs within the
United States, even while we know that it is impossible to stop
their production, or to keep them outof the United States. There
is no credible evidence anywhere which would suggest that we
could stop, or even greatly reduce, the sale of drugs within the
United States. Again, the evidence shows that this is impossible
and, not only is it a waste of money to try but, in fact, the war
against drugs actually causes far more harm than good. </p>

<p> The largest part of that harm falls upon the African-American
community. </p>

<p> GRAPH </p>

<p> I have here a few graphs which were taken directly from US
Federal Government statistics. The first graph shows the number
of people in prison over the last fifty years. The number of
people in prison was relatively stable for about fifty years,
until the 1970's when President Nixon started the first major
campaign against drugs. Then the number of inmates began to rise
sharply. It was also during the 1970's that a major recession hit
the country and African Americans, being at the bottom of the
economic totem pole, were the first to lose their jobs and the
last to be rehired when the economy changed. As a result of the
stresses on unemployed fathers, African-American families began
to fall apart and we saw the first great rise of black families
headed by single mothers. This became especially significant
because of what happened in the 1980s. </p>

<p> In the 1980s the rate of incarceration went through the roof.
Since 1980 we have tripled the number of people in prison and we
now have the largest prisons in the world. We will almost triple
their size again before the year 2000. </p>

<p> GRAPH </p>

<p> The next graph shows the racial breakdown of our prisons, and
projects those figures into the future, based on current trends.
By the year 2000, our prisons will be larger than the Nazi
concentration camps of World War II. About two-thirds of all of
the people in our prisons will be black men, most of them
arrested for non-violent drug offenses. For every black man who
goes to college, at least three will go to prison. Two-thirds of
all of today's black male teenagers will be dead, disabled, or in
prison before their thirtieth birthday. The largest single group
of them will go to prison for non-violent drug offenses. </p>

<p> Even as we speak, one-fourth of all of the young black men in
America are in prison, on probation, or on parole. In some inner
cities such as Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, which were test
cases for the war on drugs, more than half of all the young black
men in the city are under the supervision of the criminal justice
system. It is estimated that more than ninety percent of the
black men in these cities have already been incarcerated at least
once. </p>

<p> When an African-American man goes to prison he becomes
effectively permanently unemployable because nobody will hire a
black man with a prison record. Most of the young black men in
our nation's capitol are already economically dead as a direct
result of the war on drugs. </p>

<p> They become social pariahs, unwanted by employers and even by
the women in their own communities. They are unable to restore
themselves and the families that we will need to rebuild our
inner cities. The economic destruction of African-American men
caused by the war on drugs is perhaps the singlest biggest reason
that African-American families continued to disintegrate in the
1980's even in the midst of an economic boom. </p>

<p> Even conservative black leaders are now beginning to say that
the war on drugs is genocide and the new form of slavery and they
are right. Because of our misguided and ignorant drug policies,
we have already destroyed the better part of an entire generation
of African-American men. </p>

<p> In 1973 President Nixon's National Commission on Marihuana
and Drug Abuse said that the real drug problem is not heroin, or
cocaine, or marijuana. The real drug problem, they said, is the
ignorance of our public officials who have never bothered to read
the evidence. Today, we can prove that this is still true. </p>

<p> I would like my opponent to answer one simple question. I
have here a list of every major study of drug policy in the last
fifty years including the largest studies ever conducted by the
US Federal Government and the State of California. They all
recommended decriminalization. </p>

<p> Do you agree that the overwhelming weight of the scholarly
evidence on drug policy supports decriminalization? </p>

<p> Before you answer, remember that there are only three
possible answers to this question. </p>

<p> The first possible answer is yes, you agree that the
overwhelming weight of the scholarly evidence supports
decriminalization. </p>

<p> The second possible answer is no, you do not agree and,
therefore, you can provide a list of scholarly studies equal in
quality and quantity to the list I have provided. </p>

<p> The third possible answer is that you don't have a clue what
the scholarly evidence says because you have never read the most
basic research on the subject. </p>

<p> What is your answer? Do you agree that the overwhelming
weight of the scholarly evidence on drug policy supports
decriminalization? <br>

<h2>Presentations to Social Clubs </h2>

<p> <b>How to make presentations to social groups such as
churches, Lions Clubs, Rotary, and other similar groups.</b> </p>

<p> <b>By Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h3>How to find them. </h3>

<p> Many of them will be listed in your local phone directories.
If no chapters of a particular group are listed in your area, it
doesn't necessarily mean they don't exist. You can also look in
the Encyclopedia of Associations, at your local library, to
contact their national headquarters and ask for any chapters in
your area. </p>

<h3>What kind of groups typically have meetings where people can
make presentations? </h3>

<p> Here are just a few examples: </p>

<p> Lions, Rotary, Elks, Moose, churches, synagogues, Chambers of
Commerce, Business groups, other social clubs, political parties,
etc. Any place where more than a few people gather for nearly any
purpose may be an opportunity to make a presentation. </p>

<h3>How to get a date to speak to their group. </h3>

<p> First, put together a coherent, sensible presentation of
material pertinent to your area of interest. It is best to
present factual, interesting material, rather than political
diatribe. Visual displays and graphics are always good to help
keep the audience's interest. </p>

<p> Second, call them. You will be surprised at the number of
social groups which are looking for, or receptive to, speakers.
Calling them is the toughest part for many people, but it is
really easy. The worst that can happen is that they will say no,
and you have heard that before. </p>

<h3>What is interesting to these groups? </h3>

<p> Many of these groups want speakers for their regular
luncheons.all the time for their lunch and, therefore they cover
a wide variety of topics over the year. You will often find a
situation where there is someone who is designated to find good
speakers for the meetings who invariably has a hard time finding
enough interesting speakers to fill the bill. Therefore, in many
cases, there is a wide degree of latitude in what these groups
would like to hear. The facts about hemp are usually interesting
to these groups, but there are any number of other subjects which
would also get a good reception with a good presentation. </p>

<h3>Dress and act conservatively. </h3>

<p> The people in these groups are business people for the most
part, and will expect and appreciate a business like demeanor and
approach. Whether you like it or not, they are most likely to
respond favorably to conservatively dressed and
&quot;normal&quot; looking and acting people, as opposed to the
&quot;hippy&quot; look. </p>

<h3>Use Visual Aids </h3>

<p> Charts, graphs, pictures, and other visual aids can be very
helpful in getting your point across. There are a number of
charts and graphs on these pages as samples of things you might
use. </p>

<h3>Read the Persuasive Strategies and Debate Materials </h3>

<p> These social groups tend to be politically and socially
conservative so wild-eyed arguments about how it is everyone's
right to get loaded will not get a good reception. The best
approach is a soft, factual approach which presents some part of
the vast amount of information which most people don't know about
drugs. Don't promote or even defend the use of drugs, drug
dealers, or anything else that your audience will find hard to
accept. You will often have a long way to go to convince them, so
don't try to bring them too far, too fast. </p>

<h3>But I am afraid to make presentations to groups. </h3>

<p> What are you afraid of? That you will look like a fool? (As
if that hasn't happened before.) Seriously, speaking in front of
a group is one of the items which produces the highest levels of
fear in many people. They realize everyone is looking at them and
they get nervous and freeze up. The more nervous they get, the
more they worry about it, and the more nervous they get. </p>

<p> Forget it. If you are afraid of embarrassing yourself and
looking like a fool, don't worry. In the first place, most people
don't have to stand up in front of a group to look like fools, so
looking like a fool is nothing new. Get over it. Everyone looks
like a fool now and then. The truth is that most members of most
audiences are so awestruck by anyone who can get up in front of
an audience and speak (because they know they couldn't do it
themselves) that they will never notice that you are nervous - at
least not to the degree that you feel nervous. </p>

<p> Experience will get you over it. The first presentation is
the roughest, and from that point it gets progressively easier.
By this time I have done so many, and encountered all the
questions that come up so many times, that I could do these
things in my sleep. There are a lot of other people who are also
quite adept at presentations and they started out as shy
wallflowers just like you. Give it a try. You will find it is a
lot of fun. <br>

<h1>The Washington Hemp Education Network </h1>

<p> <strong>Operating Abstract</strong> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2>Abstract </h2>

<p> The following text defines the structure and mission of a
non-profit educational organization known as the Washington Hemp
Education Network (W.H.E.N.). This organization consists of
volunteer members. </p>

<h2>Mission Statement </h2>

<p> The mission of the Washington Hemp Education Network
(W.H.E.N.) is to empower the people of Washington State, through
educational activities about the history, status, and uses (both
current and potential) of the Hemp plant (cannabis sativa, also
known as marijuana), to make informed choices about the issues
surrounding re-legalization of Hemp in Washington State. </p>

<h2>Recognition of Benefit </h2>

<p> The Washington Hemp Education Network recognizes as
beneficial all responsible commercial, medicinal, and spiritual
uses of the Hemp plant conducted for peaceful ends. </p>

<h2>Program and Goals </h2>

<p> To achieve the stated mission, the Washington Hemp Education
Network will plan and implement legal, nonviolent projects that: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Raise public awareness of the history and beneficial uses
        of the Hemp plant; </li>
    <li>Educate the public to recognize and reject misinformation
        about Hemp; </li>
    <li>Facilitate changes in current laws to allow the people of
        Washington State to grow Hemp openly and engage in normal
        market activities with Hemp products; </li>
    <li>Through education and coalition, help to empower people
        who have been disempowered by misguided government
        policies concerning Hemp; </li>
    <li>Promote research and development of sustainable,
        environmentally responsible Hemp cultivation, and of
        beneficial products derived from Hemp. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Project Criteria </h3>

<p> All projects planned and implemented by the Washington Hemp
Education Network will be consistent with the Mission,
Recognition of Benefit, and Program and Goals statements defined
herein. </p>

<h3>Endorsement and Support </h3>

<p> The Washington Hemp Education Network will endorse and
support only those projects undertaken by individuals or other
entities that are consistent with the Mission, Recognition of
Benefit, and Program and Goals. </p>

<h2>Method of Operation </h2>

<p> This organization will meet regularly and will operate on the
principle of consensus. As defined by the Center for Conflict
Resolution, Madison, WI, consensus is &quot;a decision-making
process in which all parties involved explicitly agree to the
final decision. </p>

<p> Consensus decision making does not mean that all parties are
completely satisfied with the final outcome, but that the
decision is acceptable to all because no one feels that his or
her vital interests or values are violated by it.&quot; </p>

<p> A board of directors will not be elected; rather, the
founding charter members will constitute the decision-making
body, will serve as the projects and issues forum facilitation
group, and will exercise no power other than that of presiding
over meetings as defined by the Method of Operation, and of
approving membership applications and filling vacancies in the
charter member group when a charter member leaves the group. </p>

<p> Other future members may be added to the decision-making body
of charter members if a consensus decision for such action is
made by the charter members. Members other than charter members
are encouraged to participate in discussions on issues that are
being addressed during the decision-making process; participation
in the final consensus </p>

<p> decision is limited to charter members. </p>

<h3>Consensus Procedures </h3>

<ul>
    <li>o For each meeting, the charter members will appoint a
        rotating clerk, who will convene the meeting and govern
        the discussions during the meeting. The clerk is
        responsible for compiling and disseminating the agenda
        and supporting materials at least four days prior to the
        meeting. </li>
    <li>o If one or more members feel that a decision must be
        reached, the clerk must clearly state the issue to be
        decided and allow each member to speak uninterrupted
        about the issue. After each member speaks once about the
        issue, it can be debated if necessary by the group;
        however, members must not interrupt other speakers and
        must wait until granted the floor by the clerk before
        speaking. </li>
    <li>o Members must listen attentively and strive to
        understand each point of view, knowing that through the
        consensus process each decision must ultimately be a
        compromise of all points of view. </li>
    <li>o The clerk will develop a decision statement as the
        debate proceeds. The clerk will then document the
        evolution of the debate and will modify the position of
        the group by incorporating each point of view into the
        decision statement. </li>
    <li>o When all points of view have been made known, and the
        decision statement has reached a static state, the clerk
        will call for consensus on the statement. Three possible
        positions may be taken by the charter members: Consent,
        Object, or Stand Aside: </li>
    <li>o Consent indicates the member agrees to support the
        decision as the best compromise that can be achieved by
        the group. </li>
    <li>o Object indicates the member will not allow consensus to
        occur; if ONE member objects, the decision is discarded
        and no action is taken on the issue by the organization
        at that time. </li>
    <li>o Stand Aside indicates the member cannot agree with the
        decision but will not prevent the decision from being
        adopted </li>
    <li>by the group; the decision stands as long as no one
        indicates </li>
</ul>

<h2>Object. </h2>

<p> These procedures should suffice for most issues facing the
charter members of W.H.E.N. If a situation should arise that
cannot be resolved by the above procedures, the clerk will
reference the consensus handbook published by the Center for
Conflict Resolution. Charter members who are absent from
announced meetings are by default relinquishing their consensus
vote for the affected meetings only. </p>

<h1>How To Reduce Junk E-Mail </h1>

<h2>The 3 keys to reducing &quot;junk&quot; email. </h2>

<ol>
    <li><b>Accurate Subject headings.</b> </li>
    <li><b>If you send it to the whole list, make sure it applies
        to the whole list.</b> </li>
    <li><b>Be substantial, ask yourself am I contributing to the
        list or detracting?</b> </li>
</ol>

<h3>Subject Lines: </h3>

<p> One way to make it easier to get to the meaty information you
want is to have *accurate* subject lines. If the subject line of
your post says Re: Proposed Strategies and you are talking about
something completely different, or are branching off from this
discussion create a new subject heading. Example: </p>

<p> Instead of just Re: Proposed Strategies which doesn't really
tell anyone what the content of the message is about. Try... </p>

<p> Discussion of CD Tactics (was Re: Proposed Strategies) </p>

<p> This is very helpful, in discovering and only reading the
posts you want to read. </p>

<h3>Personal Posts: </h3>

<p> Short, one or two line posts that only make a personal
statement torwards one or two people should be done in private.
The main goal is to respect other members of the group enough so
as to not post something that they are just going to have delete.
</p>

<p> There are two ways to avoid problems with being personal. </p>

<ol>
    <li>If all you really want to do is make a short 1 or 2 line
        personal rseponse to someone don't send it to the entire
        list just send it to that person. </li>
    <li>If you are making personal comments make sure that there
        is also something substantial that is pertinent to
        everyone included in the post. </li>
</ol>

<p> Basically if it doesn't have something that applies to the
whole list, don't post it to the whole list. </p>

<p> Please don't hestiate to be controversial or disagree with
others, this is called freedom of speech and its why a revolution
was waged, but do NOT use drctalk-l for excessive personal
banter. If it has substance </p>

<p> with a little banter, I don't think we have a problem.
Meaning that you can say nice &quot;Amens!&quot; and &quot;Way to
go!&quot; **IF** you also include something a little bit more
meaningful. If there is no substance and a lot of banter you
probably shouldn't have sent it to the whole list. This includes
the 1 or 2 line personal notes. </p>

<p> If we still have a problem with &quot;junk&quot; posts and
the traffic volume is still too high there are more stringent
measures that can be imposed. <br>

<h1>How to Write Letters to the Editor</h1>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> <br>
</h2>

<p> A personal note by Cliff Schaffer: </p>

<p> Over the years, I have written a lot of letters to the editor
and about three out of four of them get published. A lot of
people have asked me what are the good techniques for writing
letters to the editor. The first thing I tell people is to
remember that they fit about ten letters in a typical editorial
section (out of the hundreds they receive) so the ones they
publish either: </p>

<p> 1) Are the best single expressions of what many people said. </p>

<p> 2) Make some point exceedingly well. </p>

<p> 3) Are signed by some prominent person. </p>

<p> In all cases, the letters are usually short and to the point,
and the editors have edited them even further to make them
shorter. Most people who write letters to the editor would
probably like the satisfaction you get when you see your letter
published. That way, at least you are certain that they read it.
However, it is also apparent that the media can be influenced by
letters they do not acknowledge. We have found many times that a
simple letter to someone in the media wound up in major media
coverage weeks or months later. </p>

<p> I was going to write up a formal set of rules for how to
write letters to the editor, but I found someone who had done it
already. He did quite a good job in saying the same essential
things I would have said. </p>

<p> =================================== </p>

<p> How to Write Letters to the Editor by Richard Rider </p>

<p> Short, concise letters are always more likely to be published
than long, meandering ones; try to keep them under 150 words. The
longer letters are also more likely to be edited. It's better
that you do your own editing. </p>

<p> Ever notice how you read letters to the editor in the paper?
Most people read the shorter letters first and then perhaps later
read the longer ones. Thus your shorter letter has a better
chance of being read. </p>

<p> WHAT TO WRITE? Unlike single-issue or special-interest
groups, libertarians can select from an enormous range of
subjects. Replying to editorials, agree or disagree, is very
effective. </p>

<p> Every day the news offers us all too many topics on which to
comment. </p>

<p> Be timely; try to respond within two or three days of the
article's publication. Pick an issue of particular importance to
you - don't be afraid to let some passion show through. </p>

<p> Here are some stylistic considerations: </p>

<p> 1. State the argument you're rebutting or responding to, as
briefly as possible, in the letter's introduction. Don't do a
lengthy rehash; it's a waste of valuable space and boring to
boot. </p>

<p> 2. Stick to a single subject. Deal with one issue per letter.
</p>

<p> 3. Don't be shrill or abusive. Editors tend to discard
letters containing personal attacks. Even though you're dying to
call Jesse Jackson a preachy parasite, stifle the urge. </p>

<p> 4. Your letter should be logically organized. First a brief
recitation of the argument you are opposing, followed by a
statement of your own position. Then present your evidence. Close
with a short restatement of your position or a pithy comment </p>

<p> (&quot;Jimmy Breslin says possession of firearms should be
limited to law enforcement officers. I say when only the police
have guns, the police state is just around the corner.&quot;). </p>

<p> 5. Use facts, figures and expert testimony whenever possible.
This raises your letters above the &quot;sez you, sez me&quot;
category. For instance: &quot;Anthony Lewis calls for taxing the
rich as a way to balance the budget. Is he aware of the fact that
if we confiscated the entire income of the top wage earners in
this country (those with income above $200,000), this would run
the federal government for exactly 8 days?&quot; </p>

<p> Readers respect the opinions of people with special knowledge
or expertise. Use expert testimony to bolster your case
(&quot;George Will claims we need to draft to defend America. But
General Edward C. Meyer, Army Chief of Staff, recently stated . .
.&quot;). </p>

<p> 6. Proofread your letter carefully for errors in spelling,
punctuation and grammar. Newspapers will usually edit to correct
these mistakes, but your piece is more likely to be published if
it is &quot;clean&quot; to begin with. Read your letter to a
friend, for objective input. </p>

<p> One suggestion is that a letter shouldn't be mailed the same
day it is written. Write, proofread and edit the piece. Then put
it aside until the next day. Rereading your letter in a fresh
light often helps you to spot errors in reasoning, stilted
language and the like. On the other hand, don't let the letter
sit too long and lose it's timeliness. </p>

<p> 7. Try to view the letter from the reader's perspective. Will
the arguments make sense to someone without a special background
on this issue. Did you use technical terms not familiar to the
average reader? </p>

<ol>
    <li>Should your letter be typed? In this day and age,
        generally yes. Double or triple space the letter if it is
        short. For faxing purposes, we appreciate it if the
        letter is all on one page, so single spacing might be the
        only option available. </li>
    <li>Direct your missives to &quot;Letters to the
        Editor,&quot; or some similar sounding title. </li>
</ol>

<p> 10. Always include your name, address, day-time phone number
and signature. The papers will not publish this information, but
they may use it to verify that you wrote the letter. If we are
fax broadcasting your letter, do not put a date on it. We may
have to wait a day or two before broadcasting it out, depending
on how many letters are waiting for dissemination. </p>

<p> 11. Most important - WRITE! Do not try to do a perfect
letter. Just give it a good effort and send it off. Letter
writing is the one thing that any one of us can do on our own
without the need to work through a group. No committees are
necessary. Just do it! </p>

<p> Don't be discouraged if your letter isn't published. The
editor may have received more responses on that issue than he
feels he can handle. </p>

<p> If we are faxing your letter, you will almost certainly be
published somewhere. The only drawback is that we do not have a
good feedback system, so you may not know which of the papers
publish your letter, particularly the smaller ones. </p>

<h1>A Summary of M.K. Gandhi's Technique for Political Action </h1>

<p> <b>By Mary Sibley</b> </p>

<p> February 1995 </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>PREFACE </h2>

<p> I have prepared this description of the political action
technique of M.K. Gandhi at the request of Dave Hall for
distribution to the DrugReform Coordination Network (DRCNet) and
other drug policy reform advocates who may have an interest in
Gandhi's technique. I have read much about Gandhi's technique and
know that I still do not fully comprehend its application and
implications. My knowledge is especially scanty in the area of
organizational structures through which Gandhian campaigns were
conducted, although I surmise that Gandhi's campaign
organizations were highly structured. I am currently seeking
texts describing and analyzing Gandhi's organizational
structures. If anyone has such a text, I would appreciate access
to it. If anyone has studied Gandhi's life and work and reads
something within this that seems to be wrong, misleading, or a
misinterpretation, I would welcome suggestions. In addition, I
would be glad to participate in further discussion. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>CREDITS </h2>

<p> For assistance in organizing my thoughts, I give credit to
Joan V. Bondurant, whose book &quot;Conquest of Violence: The
Gandhian Philosophy of Conflict&quot; (second edition, 1965,
Princeton University Press) I consulted occasionally while
writing this. In the text that follows, annotations are sparse.
If anyone is interested in reading more about a particular topic,
let me know and I will provide references. INTRODUCTION </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>How this Discussion Is Organized </h2>

<p> This discussion is organized into three sections. The first
section discusses the cultural context and other conditions under
which Gandhi conceived and conducted political campaigns. The
second section discusses the fundamental principles of a Gandhian
campaign. The last section discusses the steps in a Gandhian
campaign and includes my opinions about the similarities between
these steps and steps that have been taken by drug policy reform
advocates. A Short Definition of Gandhi's Political Technique
Gandhi's political technique is a process of creatively engaging
with others to transform an unjust cultural, economic, social, or
governmental system into one that is more just. Scope of Gandhi's
Technique Gandhi is most famous for his political activism with
respect to ending British rule in India. He used the technique
not just to work toward reform and ultimately removal of British
rule in India, but also in many conflict situations between
Indians only. For example, he organized and led programs designed
to change how the upper class Hindus treated the lower class
Hindus. Gandhi himself considered his most important work the
constructive programs designed to remove the underlying causes of
poverty and to rebuild strong local economies in impoverished
areas. Without this work, poor Indians would not have had the
sustenance needed to participate in the many campaigns that led
to home rule. Martin Luther King applied techniques similar to
Gandhi's in the United States when working to end civil rights
injustices based on race. Many of King's programs, speeches, and
writings strongly resemble Gandhi's, with terminology and other
specifics tailored to the issues and systems at hand. Another
20th century leader who has successfully used similar techniques
when engaging a cruel and conscience-less government is Vaclav
Havel. The injustices that these leaders were working to overcome
occurred in widely varying cultures, social systems, and
governments. Because I assume that most readers are specifically
interested in political strategies with regard to changing unjust
laws in the U.S., the following discussion focuses on the
application of Gandhi's techniques in conflicts with governments.
</p>

<h2>SECTION 1. CONTEXT AND CONDITIONS </h2>

<h3>The Cultural Context in which Gandhi Developed His Techniques
</h3>

<p> India is multi-cultural with most cultures based on
religions. The Hindus are the largest group, followed by the
Muslims, who constitute a large minority. Then come a much
smaller number of Sikhs. Many other religious groups exist, but
they are very small in numbers. People of these religions had
lived side-by-side in relative peace for thousands of years when
the British arrived. As the British became established
economically, they started an insidious campaign to divide the
Indian people along religious lines, especially by planting in
Muslims fear of discrimination from Hindus should the British not
keep the Hindu influence in check. The British were quite
successful in promoting disunity between the Hindus and Muslims,
a legacy that to this day engenders hatred and bloodshed. The
Sikhs were selected to be the native component of the
British-controlled police force. The Sikhs were a large enough
minority to provide enough police for British purposes, and yet a
small enough group that Sikh police were patrolling and
incarcerating primarily Hindus and Muslims. After a couple of
hundred years of British encroachment on the cultures,
inter-cultural fear and suspicion that had not existed before the
British became the norm. </p>

<h3>Gandhi's Starting Place in Society </h3>

<p> Gandhi was born a Hindu. The Hindu society is stratified
(some say &quot;calcified&quot;) into classes referred to as
castes. The caste into which one is born determines the jobs one
may have, the education one may pursue, the privileges one is
allowed, the places one may gather water, the people with whom
one may eat, etc. The highest caste is the Brahmans; the lowest,
the untouchables. Outside of these are the outcastes. The
outcastes are those who violated the rules of their caste to the
extent that the authorities within the caste cast them out.
Thereafter, they are to be shunned by others in the caste--no one
may help them, they are not allowed to work within the caste,
etc. Gandhi was a member of the Bania caste, which participated
in business and government in his home state. Gandhi was publicly
ordered an outcaste when he was in his late teens because he went
to Britain to study law; his caste's leaders said it was against
the religion to leave the country. The leaders actually went so
far as to inform the caste members that if they saw him off when
he left for England, they would be fined! Gandhi wrote in his
autobiography, &quot;The order had no effect on me, and I took my
leave . . .&quot; ( M.K. Gandhi, &quot;An Autobiography: The
Story of My Experiments with the Truth,&quot; Part I, Chapter
XII, [1927] translation by Mahadev Desai, published in the U.S.
in 1957 by Beacon Press, Boston). </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>SECTION 2. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES </h2>

<p> Gandhi adhered to four fundamental principles familiar to the
Westerner. Three are truth, non-violence, and self-suffering. The
fourth is concerned with means and ends. All campaigns conducted
under his guidance were consistent with these principles
(occasional errors arose due to the experimental nature of the
technique and limitations in campaigners' previous experience).
These fundamental principles are summarized below. </p>

<h3>Truth </h3>

<p> Gandhi did not fully define the &quot;truth&quot; but instead
said that he was seeking after it. He was seeking after it
through socio-political action, just as others might seek after
it through a mystical or spiritual path, the study of
mathematics, or the creation of art. I gather from my readings
that the goals of most his contemporaries were much more
immediate and concrete (like a cost-of-living increase for
workers in a textile mill, the right for untouchables to walk
past a temple used by Brahmans, the replacement of British rule
with home rule, etc.). The replacement of British rule was a
mighty goal. Those who held it accepted the need for a large
number of intermediate goals that they collectively agreed (often
after long and arduous debate) would contribute directly or
indirectly to achievement of the mighty goal. Some of the
intermediate goals included things that even the most uneducated,
illiterate, and impoverished could grasp immediately, like: (1)
Having all Indians weave their own cloth rather than buy British
cloth (most Indians made their own clothing) and (2) Repealing a
salt taxation and regulation scheme that drove the cost of salt
so high that the poor could not afford it. Salt is an essential
dietary element in India's climate and can be collected from
India's ocean beaches or retrieved from inland deposits by anyone
after a bit of instruction. The salt laws brought the British
significant revenues. Enforcement of the salt laws included fines
and incarceration for those who were caught making or collecting
salt for personal use and most especially if the person was
producing and distributing marketable amounts outside of the
government's regulatory structure. </p>

<h3>Non-Violence </h3>

<p> Gandhi maintained that no human or group of humans could know
the complete truth. No matter how close one thinks one might be
to the truth, one could be in error either wholly or in some
lesser way that is not immediately apparent. Because of this, he
maintained that no one could use violence toward others to press
his or her view of the truth forward. This principle excluded all
acts of violence, and Gandhi's definition of violence was broad.
As one might expect, physical violence could not be used against
an opponent. He also maintained that there should be no violence
in one's expression and words. The non-violence principle
required that an opponent be treated with utmost respect. Smear
campaigns aimed at defamation of character were not in his
political action toolbox, just as murder of lawmakers, judges,
bureaucrats, and police were not in his toolbox. Gandhi's
non-violence is a full antonym for violence. Not only does
non-violence refrain from destructive acts, it is aggressively
and provocatively constructive. Thus, Gandhi's campaigns did not
seek to defeat an opponent, but instead to convert the opponent
to a more just position and to challenge the opponent to act upon
the new position. In addition, Gandhi held that there must be an
opportunity for an opponent to save face, so long as no
fundamental principle or aim of the action was thereby
compromised. </p>

<h3>Self-Suffering </h3>

<p> Self-suffering is an integral element of Gandhi's technique
and a necessary corollary to provocative non-violent action.
Self-suffering can take the form of material and social
sacrifice. For example, loss of employment, property, or income
as a result of holding to one's view of the truth is a form of
self-suffering. Self-suffering reaches its personal extremes in
incarceration, physical injury, and the sacrifice of one's life.
Gandhi wrote: &quot;Suffering injury in one's own person is . . .
of the essence of non-violence and is the chosen substitute for
violence to others.&quot; (M.K. Gandhi, &quot;Non-violence in
Peace and War,&quot; 2nd edition, Ahmedabad: Navajivan, 1944, p.
49). He also wrote, &quot;Non-violence in its dynamic condition
means conscious suffering. It does not mean meek submission to
the will of the evil-doer, but it means the pitting of one's
whole soul against the will of the tyrant.&quot; (M.K. Gandhi, in
&quot;Young India,&quot; August 11, 1920 ). Self-suffering is
preferred over submitting to humiliation and pr ovides a way to
preserve one's personal dignity in the face of those who would
treat one unjustly. Throughout his writings and campaigns, Gandhi
emphasized that inviting self-suffering is something that must
not be done lightly. One who invites self-suffering must be
prepared for the fullest possible sacrifice that may result from
one's actions. </p>

<h3>Means and Ends </h3>

<p> Gandhi believed that means do not serve ends, rather means
create ends. Thus, to attain an end that is positive and
truthful, one must use means that are positive and truthful. This
philosophy can be summarized by his statement, &quot;the means
are the ends in the making.&quot; Means that create ends have two
interesting implications. First, one cannot define a just,
non-violent end and then use unjust and violent means to attain
it--for the end will be in character with the means used. This
view precludes taking actions under the philosophy summarized in
the statement &quot;the ends justify the means&quot;--a
philosophy that seems to permeate current U.S. policy-making.
Indeed, the &quot;ends&quot; being created by current government
policy with regard to some drugs are very different than the
officially stated goals. </p>

<p> A second implication is that, while one must always be moving
toward a goal of pure truth and justice, the end cannot be
defined precisely in advance. Each action one takes creates the
next action and that one, the next, each action always in keeping
with the last and moving progressively closer to truth and
justice. Through actively engaging with fellow activists and the
opponent, one grows in understanding of what must be done, a step
at a time, to create the most just and truthful end. </p>

<p> The technique becomes dynamic when it succeeds in provoking
internal change in the opponent. Thus the knowledge and
understanding of both the activist and the opponent grow
simultaneously toward truth and justice. However, the technique
is not self-propelling; it is usually used in a context of a
stagnant, inert, or deliberately destructive force and requires
tremendous energy. The activist must constantly reassess the
opponent's comprehension and adjust the program so that it is
more than reactive to the opponent's change--every change must be
viewed as an opportunity to press the campaign further forward. </p>

<h3>What Gandhi's Contemporaries Thought About the Fundamental
Principles </h3>

<p> A few of Gandhi's contemporaries adhered to the fundamental
principles as inviolable guides by which to conduct one's
personal life as well as one's social or political actions.
However, the majority of his contemporaries accepted the
fundamental principles as policies. They recognized the success
of the principles in empowering the disempowered and realized
that, even if viewed as policies, the principles were the key to
winning &quot;home rule&quot; with an unarmed and impoverished
army of the disenfranchised. </p>

<p> This acceptance as policy rather than principle caused Gandhi
some dismay. When the activists with whom he was working rejected
these even as policy, he would leave the political sphere and
return to his constructive work toward remedying the devastating
economic problems in the villages of India. Eventually, his
contemporaries always asked him to return to the political
sphere. </p>

<h2>SECTION 3. STEPS OF A GANDHIAN CAMPAIGN </h2>

<h3>The Progress of a Campaign </h3>

<p> Upon discovering an opportunity for reform or change, a
campaign is conducted through several steps. Each step is a
necessary prerequisite to the next, for each must fully develop
the context in which the next occurs. The early steps develop the
public stage upon which later steps, if they become necessary,
can be played out. Some of the steps initiated early in the
campaign, especially education, continue throughout the campaign.
The progression is designed to maximize early in the campaign all
opportunities for the opponent to make positive changes and save
face without campaigners moving to more provocative measures. The
careful progression provides fullest opportunity for the
campaigners to adjust their position if they discover that they
have inadvertently violated a fundamental principle. It gives
campaign leaders the opportunity, through engaging with the
opponent early in relatively low-risk situations, to
realistically assess their own strengths and weaknesses and those
of the campaigners and to determine what more provocative steps
can and cannot be taken successfully. </p>

<p> A Summary of the Steps of a Gandhian Campaign </p>

<p> The steps of a campaign are: </p>

<p> -- Investigation of the facts, situation, and conditions </p>

<p> -- Education of the campaigners, the public, and the opponent
</p>

<p> -- Negotiation and arbitration </p>

<p> -- Preparation of the campaigners for more provocative
measures </p>

<p> -- Agitation </p>

<p> -- Issuing of an ultimatum </p>

<p> -- Economic boycott and forms of strike </p>

<p> -- Non-cooperation </p>

<p> -- Civil disobedience </p>

<p> -- Creation of alternate structures </p>

<p> In India, these steps eventually led to the establishment of
a parallel government in some places, which provided Indians with
some of the experience needed to assume self-government when
British rule was removed. </p>

<p> The steps of a campaign are described in the paragraphs
below. In brackets I have mentioned my current opinion of where
drug policy reform advocates have made the most progress.
Investigation of the Facts, Situation, and Conditions A Gandhian
campaign is founded on an objective assessment of the facts. All
facts are considered; none are rejected or downplayed if they do
not fit the expectations of the campaigners--to do so would be to
move away from the complete truth. The situation of campaigners
and those experiencing the injustice are examined. As full an
understanding of the situation as possible is developed among all
involved. The conditions at the time--public awareness and
opinion, the situation of the opponent, and other relevant
factors are all considered and weighed. </p>

<p> [Drug policy reform advocates seem to me to be strongest
here. The only difficulty I've seen is the occasional attempt to
reject or downplay a pertinent fact that doesn't quite
&quot;fit,&quot; but this is usually remedied through discussion
among reform advocates.] </p>

<h3>Education of the Campaigners, the Public, and the Opponent </h3>

<p> With the facts in hand and the situation and conditions fully
examined, education begins. All who join the campaign must be
educated; they become representatives through their association
and must be fully informed. The public is often unaware of or
misinformed about injustices; they must be educated to understand
why change is needed. Many opponents are similar to the
public--they are unaware or misinformed. Gandhi felt that there
were only a few pponents who would actually want injustices to be
perpetuated or continue. Gandhi was an optimist and believed even
those few could be converted. [Drug policy reform advocates are
weak here, but getting stronger. At the International Conference
for Drug Policy Reform last November, attendees recognized the
need to raise public awareness about injustices of the drug war.
I understand that organizations like NORML are following up with
activities geared toward education of the general public. The
Washington Hemp Education Network (W.H.E.N.) was started by a
group of marijuana policy reform activists in Washington State
who recognized the need for education. My personal experience has
been that many of the people who join W.H.E.N. recognize the
injustices and are looking for the facts. Others join because
they have much knowledge and want opportunities to educate and
persuade others. Some relish entering the opponents' sphere and
educating! Also, Cliff Schaffer's persuasive strategies provide
an excellent example of guidelines that have been tailored to
move the opponent toward the truth given an opponent's entry
position in a discussion. Such guidelines must be assessed and
modified periodically to ensure that they keep pace with the
inevitable progress the opponents will make when so persuaded.] </p>

<h3>Negotiation and Arbitration </h3>

<p> Remedy for the injustice is sought first through established
channels within the existing system. Petitioning for change of
unjust laws, challenging unjust laws in the courts, and other
legislative or legal methods fall under this step. </p>

<p> [Drug policy reform advocates working on reform of marijuana
laws have done plenty of negotiation and arbitration at the
federal level and in many states. I am not aware of as high of a
level of negotiation effort for substances like heroin, cocaine,
etc.] </p>

<h3>Preparation of the Campaigners for More Provocative Measures </h3>

<p> Immediately upon recognizing the existence of a conflict
situation that might lead to more provocative measures, Gandhi's
technique calls for intense preparation. The motives of
campaigners are examined, weaknesses of the group are identified,
and exercises in self-discipline undertaken. The goal of this
step is to assess and develop the campaigners' ability to adhere
to fundamental principles and to continue action in the face of
significant risks. There is much discussion of the issues at
hand, the current situation and conditions, and of the potential
results of various courses of action. [I have not heard of drug
policy reform advocates undertaking such self-examination and
participating in mutually agreed upon exercises in
self-discipline. I have heard discussions and analyses about
potential actions that fall under subsequent steps.] </p>

<h3>Agitation </h3>

<p> Agitation includes legal high-profile activities such as
rallies and picketing. Such events are opportunities for the
leaders to assess the group's readiness to proceed with higher
profile and more difficult steps without deteriorating into
violence. Mass gatherings also provide an opportunity to begin
instructing campaigners who have not been trained previously in
the fundamental principles, to communicate developments in the
campaign, and to explain the next step. </p>

<p> [I haven't heard much about this kind of agitation. Agitation
I have heard about has involved small numbers of people and, as
far as I know, it has not been part of a sequence of steps such
as described here. I do not believe that Hemp Fests, even if no
one smoked, would meet the criteria by which Gandhi defined
agitation because they are not part of a highly focused political
campaign and do not have a strong educational focus.] </p>

<h3>Issuing of an Ultimatum </h3>

<p> A strong appeal is made to the opponent. The appeal is quite
explicit. It states the problem, identifies a constructive
solution and the responsibilities of each party in the solution,
and explains what the campaigners will do if the opponent does
not participate in the solution. The ultimatum should include
provision for the opponent to save face within the scope of the
fundamental principles. The opponent is fully informed about the
next step. In fact, from this step forward, every single step
taken is preceded by a full advance disclosure to the opponent of
what will be done, when, and where. Before each step commences,
the opponent is offered the opportunity to change. </p>

<p> [If drug policy reform advocates started a Gandhian campaign
today, I believe that they would be years from being able to
issue ultimatums that actually carried any weight.] </p>

<h3>Economic Boycott and Forms of Strike </h3>

<p> In India, Indians boycotted foreign cloth with such success
that they had a significant impact on the mills in Britain.
Strikes have been used extensively in the U.S. for in all kinds
of reform campaigns A scene in the movie &quot;Gandhi&quot; shows
the power of a nationwide strike. [To conduct an economic boycott
requires economic alternatives for the boycotters. To conduct an
effective strike, a campaign needs great numbers of campaigners
and who have economic alternatives. As far as I can tell, drug
policy reform advocates are generally dependent on the dominant
economic structures and so are weak on this point.] </p>

<h3>Non-Cooperation </h3>

<p> Non-cooperation involves refusal to support the portions of
the system that require reform or accept benefits from the
system. For example, during the campaign to remove British rule,
Indians resigned from government posts, removed their children
from government schools, returned awards and medals that they had
received from the government, and so on. Economic boycott and
strikes described in the previous step can be regarded as forms
of non-cooperation. [The judges who refuse to try drug cases are
engaged in non-cooperation. People who refuse to provide urine
samples as a condition of employment are engaged in
non-cooperation.] </p>

<h3>Civil Disobedience </h3>

<p> Civil disobedience extends non-cooperation to the active and
open breaking of selected laws. Gandhi set complete and voluntary
obedience to laws as a prerequisite for civil disobedience. Laws
to be broken were selected very carefully for their position at
the heart of the problem or for their symbolic value. Civil
disobedience involves a deliberate courting of arrest and, upon
arrest, no defense is offered in the courts. In fact, full
admission of guilt is required. The prosecutors, juries, and
judges are challenged to see the injustice of the law that they
are defending against the civil disobedient and to cease their
cooperation with the injustice. In mass campaigns involving civil
disobedience in India, prisons filled up very quickly. Very
often, the leaders were arrested in an attempt to dishearten the
campaigners and end the campaign. Sometimes they were arrested
upon delivery to the authorities of their notice of intent to
disobey! Other times, the government ignored them completely
which, of course, encouraged more people to join the campaign. If
the government ignores the first civil disobedients, the
provocative nature of increasing numbers of civil disobedients
eventually compels the government to act. And compelling the
opponent to act is the point of civil disobedience. Two important
organizational points must be mentioned here. Every campaign in
which the leaders may be arrested must provide succession of
leadership. A succession procedure must be planned in advance so
that civil disobedience continues apace no matter how many
leaders have been arrested. The second point involves support for
the families of the civil disobedients. There must always be
people who are willing to forego civil disobedience and remain
free to take care of the children, the aged, and the ill. Support
people should be identified in advance and should, under no
circumstances, court arrest. </p>

<p> [Medicinal marijuana suppliers and users come to mind as a
possible example of civil disobedients, although an analysis
would reveal that very few of these civil disobedients actually
meet all of the criteria set forth by Gandhi.] </p>

<h3>Creation of Alternate Structures </h3>

<p> If, after all of these steps, the existing system fails to
become more just, an alternate means of ensuring justice must be
developed. This is especially important when the existing system
is so corrupt that people are disobeying it not just as part of a
campaign, but simply because they find themselves unable to
conduct their lives peacefully without disobeying it. Such a
system is approaching inevitable collapse by virtue of its
inherent flaws. Alternate structures must be built in advance not
only to provide for immediate needs, but also to prevent (or at
least mitigate) the potential release of destructive,
anger-driven energy that often follows an oppressive system's
collapse. [Medicinal marijuana buyers' clubs provide an example
of an alternate structure.] </p>

<h3>Demands of Gandhi's Technique on Campaigners </h3>

<p> Gandhi's technique exacts a great deal from a campaign's
leadership and those who follow them. They must tirelessly plan
and monitor the progress of the campaign, reassess their position
and the position of the opponent, and respond creatively and
provocatively to events as they unfold. Leaders must be flexible
enough to respond to change. </p>

<p> At the same time, they must have the insight to know which
potential responses might lead to stagnation of the campaign or
will compromise a fundamental principle--for either will lead to
setbacks. </p>

<p> Leaders must be consummate communicators: with the opponent,
the public, potential supporters, and those who have joined the
campaign--else misunderstandings and misinterpretations can arise
as the campaign is adjusted to changing conditions and events.
Leaders must have an ability to organize, inspire, and use fully
the talents of an extremely diverse group of people who volunteer
their services to a campaign. People with widely varying
perspectives and beliefs must be transformed from a disorganized
scattering of supporters in conflict not just with the
government, but often with each other, to a coherent, responsive
unit that can target its actions and responses with great force.
Finally, all in the campaign must have an ability to manage or
dispel the tension and anger that can arise when their efforts
appear to be frustrated, when there are disagreements among
campaigners, and when they directly confront an often-hostile
opponent. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>CONCLUSION </h2>

<p> Many drug policy reform advocates have been using political
action techniques similar (though not identical) to the steps
described above. But drug policy reform advocates have not
catalyzed into a dynamic, coherent group that can act
synchronously to achieve a clearly defined goal. I believe that,
if reform advocates' efforts were synthesized in a Gandhian
sequence with an underpinning of the fundamental principles,
success would be inevitable. </p>

<p>LIBERTY ACTIVISTS' LIST </p>

<p> v 1.36 06/1995 </p>

<p> So you're sick of the &quot;War on Drugs&quot;? Here's an
international list of over 200 organizations which support drug
law reform, although most of them are in the US. Look for one in
your area. Please distribute this list widely, and send in any
groups which are not listed already. There's an active group here
for almost any taste. Joining your favorite organization is best,
though if you're worried about persecution, just send anonymous
money or a letter of appreciation. Take advantage of your
democratic rights while you still have some! </p>

<p> If you're already in a law reform organisation, you can use
this list to contact others with similar interests, and share
information or facilities. Just knowing that there are others
working on these issues can be a big morale booster. </p>

<p> The power of pro-liberty organisations can be multiplied many
times by fast and efficient communication, which spreads news and
promotes co-ordinated action. Electronic mail and conferencing is
the most efficient way to achieve these necessary abilities. For
example, this list doubled its size in eight months of
circulation over the Internet. I strongly encourage active groups
and individuals to use this powerful technology. </p>

<p> This listing was originally kicked off with a list of groups
reproduced with permission from the February, 1992 issue of High
Times magazine (contact details at the end of the list). </p>

<p> Since then, it has grown considerably through the kindness of
those who have contributed additional entries, including Chris
Klausmeier, Macca Macpherson, Dave Thomson and Keith Lim. </p>

<p> Please reproduce and distribute widely with this
acknowledgment. Post it on bulletin boards if you can. </p>

<p> PLEASE SEND NEW LISTINGS </p>

<p> I don't know any more about most of these groups, than what
appears here. If you know about other active groups not listed
here, or if any entries need correction, please e-mail me at
schaffer@smartlink.net, or mail to the address below, for
incorporation in future editions of this list. </p>

<p><b>Speaking Out Against Drug Legalization</b> </p>

<p><b>or How to Hold Your Own in a Drug Legalization Debate</b> </p>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p><strong>by Clifford A. Schaffer</strong> </p>

<p>What follows in these pages is the Drug Enforcement
Administrations's booklet &quot;How to Hold Your Own In a Drug
Legalization Debate&quot; which outlines the top ten reasons why
they think &quot;legalization&quot; is such a bad idea. I will
examine their statements, sentence by sentence, and present
comments. Readers should note that, while the DEA has written a
book on how to survive when defending the War on (Some) Drugs,
the DEA has no interest in coming forward to actually engage in
such a debate. An open and honest public debate is the last the
thing the DEA wants. </p>

<h4>LETTER OF INTRODUCTION </h4>

<p>Dear Reader: </p>

<p>You and I are frequently faced with the need to address many
of the positions which are advocated by those calling for the
legalization of drugs. More and more, the debate on legalization
is being given public airing in the media. Average citizens, fed
up with crime and drugs, are being told that legalization is a
reasonable alternative to the crime problem that so many
communities are struggling against. </p>

<p>You and I know that legalization is not an alternative, <b>but
</b>rather a surrender which will further reduce our quality of
life. Ninety percent of the American people agree that
legalization of drugs would complicate an already devastating
situation. Health and social costs associated with the increased
availability of drugs would break our economy. Crime would not
decrease. The moral fiber of our country would be torn apart. </p>

<p>Those who advocate legalization have many motives. But they
frequently do not have answers to a lot of the questions we are
asking. Legalization is an abstract to many of them. But I can
tell you firsthand, from my thirtyfour years' experience as a
lawenforcement officer at the state level, the damage caused by
drugs is real and lasting. It's not drug laws, or the enforcement
of the drugs laws of our nation that are causing harm--it's the
drugs themselves. </p>

<p>Because we're often called on to speak to the issues, I asked
a number of professionals from the law enforcement, health, and
academic communities to come together for two days to discuss how
we can best address the arguments against legalization. I am well
aware that local law enforcement officials are on the front line
in the battle against drug abuse. For that reason I asked several
police chiefs to participate in the Quantico Conference to give
their expertise and guidance as we formulated our response to
these issues. This guide represents most of the issues and
arguments raised during that time. This booklet is intended as a
resource for you as you are faced with the questions and issues
associated with the debate on the legalization of drugs. While
many professionals participated in the session, the views
represented in this document are the position of the Drug
Enforcement Administration. They represent the consensus of the
assembled group and without necessarily attributing each and
every position to the personal views of each participant. </p>

<p>Please feel free to use the guide in whatever way you feel it
is appropriate. The debate on the legalization of drugs cannot be
won if we remain silent. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p><strong>Thomas A. Constantine</strong> </p>

<p>Administrator </p>

<p>Drug Enforcement Administration </p>

<h3>The Reply to the DEA's Statement</h3>

<hr>

<h4>REPLY TO THE LETTER OF INTRODUCTION </h4>

<p>The DEA really has no business spending taxpayer dollars to
promote their own political agenda. The DEA acts as lobbyist and
public relations firm for themselves and other special interest
groups which benefit from the drug war and it should be stopped. </p>

<p>In the course of this public advocacy the DEA distorts the
truth on many occasions, lies shamefully at times and draws
invalid conclusions from what is true. The purpose of this
booklet was to try to stop the damage being done when the drug
warriors were caught in public spouting the old mythology of the
drug war, but we will demonstrate clear examples of the lies and
distortions here in their book. </p>

<p>We agree that the debate on the legalization of drugs cannot
be won by anyone who remains silent. That is why we challenge the
DEA to bring forth their best against our best in an open public
environment where these issues can be discussed at length. We
have asked for an open debate on this issue since February 23,
1993 when the Resolution for a Federal Commission on Drug Policy
was first signed. It is only the DEA who is afraid to debate this
issue in public. </p>

<p>We challenge the DEA to show the strength and truth of their
arguments by supporting our call for an objective Federal
Commission where all of the issues and evidence can be fully
examined. If they are right, the evidence will show it. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Clifford A. Schaffer <br>

to these issues and answering the                                        
questions can be a challenge.                                            
Questions about legalization often                                       
touch on many issues: crime,

DEA is unequivocally opposed to     As the DEA itself points out later   
the legalization of illicit drugs.  in their book, there is no clear     
                                    definition of &quot;legalization&quot; but,    
                                    whatever it is, they are against     
                                    it.                                  
                                                                         
                                    Actually, &quot;legalization&quot; is not the  
                                    issue, because we really don't know  
                                    if we will ever do it.  The issue    
                                    is really whether we need serious    
                                    reform of the current policy, no

                                    ever will.  In point of fact, this   
                                    policy often makes the illegal       
                                    drugs more available to

                                    reasons that alcohol Prohibition     
                                    was repealed.                        
                                                                         
                                    Whether availability, demand, use,

                                    &quot;legalization&quot;.  If you mean that    
                                    there would be cocaine vending       
                                    machines alongside the tobacco       
                                    vending machines, and convenience    
                                    store clerks would wink as they      
                                    sold heroin to children in the same  
                                    way that they wink when they sell    
                                    tobacco, then drug use might         
                                    increase.   If the drug laws are     
                                    somewhat more sensible, there is     
                                    good evidence to believe that drug   
                                    use would drop.                      

(4) remove the social sanction      There are many ways to have social   
against drug abuse that is          sanctions reinforced in legislation  
reinforced in legislation.          and everyone would agree that some   
                                    laws are necessary to achieve best   
                                    results with the drug problem.  The  
                                    question is whether it does any      
                                    good to enforce those social         
                                    sanctions with prison.  All the      
                                    evidence says that prison does more  
                                    harm than good.

There are a few things to remember  This is no surprise.  There has      
when discussing the legalization    been a concerted media campaign to   
issue.                              instil this belief in the American   
                                    public over the last several

Second, when discussing             Strangely enough, information is     
legalization, it is important that  the one thing that all drug

the twoday session, group leaders

weakness of the prolegalization                                          
position. Participants in the

Should all drugs be legalized ?     The question is not whether any      
                                    drugs should be &quot;legalized&quot; because  
                                    the DEA itself states further down   
                                    in this book that there is no real   
                                    definition of &quot;legalization.&quot;  Is    
                                    alcohol legal?  In some senses it    
                                    is, and in others it is not.  The    
                                    same is true of many other drugs.    
                                    If the DEA is right, we will never   
                                    &quot;legalize&quot; any of these drugs, so    
                                    they miss the point to focus on      
                                    &quot;legalization.&quot;                      
                                                                         
                                    The real question is prison.  Right  
                                    now we are embarked on a course      
                                    which will incarcerate millions of   
                                    people who, in the view of many of   
                                    the prison wardens in this country,  
                                    don't need to be in prison.  We are  
                                    turning loose violent felons so we   
                                    can incarcerate more drug users.     
                                    With these laws, we have the         
                                    opportunity to imprison literally    
                                    millions of people.  We must decide  
                                    how many millions of people we are   
                                    going to put in prison to make this  
                                    policy work.                         
                                                                         
                                    As a personal matter, I don't much   
                                    like cigars.  I think they are       
                                    addictive, dangerous, smelly, and    
                                    disgusting. I cannot understand why  
                                    anyone would want to walk around     
                                    with one of those things stuck in    
                                    their face,  and I make my feelings  
                                    known to anyone who lights one up    
                                    in my presence.  At the same time,   
                                    I don't want to put George Burns in  
                                    prison.                              
                                                                         
                                    No matter what policy we may         
                                    devise, or what name we may call     
                                    it, it is an undeniable truth that   
                                    putting people in prison does no     
                                    good at all.                         

Who will determine which segments   Who determines the access to drugs   
of the population will have access  now?                                 
to legalized drugs?                 Under &quot;legalization&quot; it would be     
                                    the same people who do it for        
                                    alcohol and tobacco.                 

Will they be limited only to        Are they limited to people over      
people over eighteen ?              eighteen now?                        
                                                                         
                                    Every major proposal for reform      
                                    assumes that minors should not have  
                                    access to drugs.  This is one of     
                                    the major reasons that many people   
                                    would like to see reform, because a  
                                    more sensible policy would do a      
                                    better job of keeping drugs away     
                                    from children.                       

Will cocaine, heroin, LSD and PCP   Are they available now?  As the DEA  
be made available if people         itself admits, their efforts have    
request them?                       never had any major effect on        
                                    availability of drugs and it is      
                                    unlikely that they ever will affect  
                                    the drug market.                     

Who will sell drugs? The            Who sells them now?                  
Government? Private companies ?     You can't think of anyone who could  
                                    do a better job than the current     
                                    sellers?                             

And who is liable for damages       The rules for liability should be    
caused by drug use and the          consistent for all drugs.  If you    
activities of those taking drugs?   get hit by a drunk or stoned         
                                    driver, it doesn't matter to you     
                                    which chemical caused the problem.   
                                    The damage is done in either case,   
                                    and should be addressed the same     
                                    under law.                           

Who will collect the revenues       Who collects them now?               
generated by the drug sales?        We have funded the richest criminal  
                                    organizations in the history of the  
                                    world with this policy. It is time   
                                    to take the money out of their       
                                    hands with a more sensible policy.   

How will a black market for         The same way it is controlled for    
cheaper drugs be controlled ?       alcohol and tobacco.                 

Who will bear the costs to society  Under the current system the         
of increased drug use?              taxpayers bear the entire cost, and  
                                    this system uses the single most     
                                    expensive, least cost-effective      
                                    approach to the problem -- prison.   
                                    For the same money it takes to       
                                    catch, try, and convict one drug     
                                    offender and to hold them in prison  
                                    for five years, we can provide       
                                    treatment or education for more      
                                    than one hundred people.  Which do   
                                    you think is the better deal?        

How will absenteeism and loss of    It should be addressed the same way  
productivity be  addressed by       it is for alcohol, tobacco, or any   
business?                           similar problem.                     

Will the local drug situation in a  Who dictates where drugs are sold    
community dictate which drugs are   now?                                 
sold where?                         The community itself should dictate  
                                    these matters, as they do with       
                                    liquor and tobacco outlets.          

How will society care for and pay   First, there is no real evidence     
for the attendant social costs of   that drug use would increase under   
increased drug use, including       a more sensible policy.              
family disintegration and child     Society is paying these costs        
neglect?                            already.  Reform would seek to       
                                    reduce those costs by using          
                                    approaches which are more            
                                    cost-effective than prison.  Prison  
                                    does not do anything to address      
                                    these problems.                      

Will people still need              This is a separate issue and,        
prescriptions for currently         whichever way it goes, will not      
controlled medications, such as     make much difference to the          
antibiotics, if drugs are           fundamental problems of our current  
legalized ?                         drug policy.  Antibiotics are an     
                                    entirely different class of drug     
                                    with an entirely different set of    
                                    uses and associated problems.        
                                    Therefore, it would be appropriate   
                                    to have a different policy for       
                                    them.                                

Will legal drugs require            That depends on what you mean by     
prescriptions?                      &quot;legal&quot;.  For example, both alcohol  
                                    and penicillin are &quot;legal&quot; but have  
                                    different requirements for           
                                    purchasing them.                     

Can anyone, regardless of physical  Who can purchase them now?           
or medical conditions purchase                                           
drugs?                              Can anyone, regardless of physical   
                                    or medical conditions purchase       
                                    alcohol or tobacco?  Alcohol and     
                                    tobacco are the big killers by a     
                                    wide margin. If we can manage to     
                                    find a workable policy for alcohol   
                                    and tobacco, then the other drugs    
                                    will be easy.                        

How can we deal with the influx of  We won't have to.  The rest of the   
people to the United States who     western world is going toward        
are seeking legal drugs?            &quot;legalization&quot; faster than we are.   

Can we begin a legalization pilot   Yes.  As the New York City Bar       
program in your neighborhood for    Association recommended, we should   
one year?                           allow states and communities to      
                                    determine their own approach to the  
                                    problem, as they do for alcohol, so  
                                    that we might have a number of       
                                    different programs from which to     
                                    draw ideas and information.  The     
                                    one thing we should not do is to     
                                    stay locked in to a single national  
                                    policy which -- by definition --     
                                    cannot work.                         

Should the distribution outlets be  Where are the distribution outlets   
located in the already              located now?                         
overburdened inner city?                                                 
                                    Matters affecting the inner city     
                                    should be decided by the people in   
                                    the inner city.

<h1>How to Hold Your Own In a Drug Legalization Debate </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The three groups discussing legalization at Quantico touched
on a number of significant issues. It was evident to the
participants that the prolegalization arguments have remained
fairly consistent over the years and that there are ten major
claims that can be made in opposition of legalization. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The participants have missed the point again. The arguments
have changed over the last few years in particular, which is what
brought them to Quantico in the first place. </p>

<p>We have attempted to provide the ten simple, compelling claims
to help you frame your arguments against legalization. The claims
are backed up by facts, quotes and statistics. Periodically,
these will need to be updated to ensure that the most current
information is being used to craft arguments against
legalization. </p>

these ten claims are gone, it will have no more argument for
continuing this drug war. </p>

<h2>CLAIM I: CRIME, VIOLENCE AND DRUG USE GO HAND IN HAND </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>In this claim, the DEA does the first of its major distortions
- the lumping together of all drugs into the same group.
Different drugs have different effects and, for some drugs, there
is clearly very little association with violence. Marijuana and
tobacco are two examples of drugs with little reason to believe
that they are connected to violence. The DEA does not mention
hemp (marijuana) in this Claim so we must assume that they agree
that this argument would not apply to hemp (marijuana) in any
case. </p>

<p>Even if we accepted the DEA's arguments that drugs, and not
prohibition, causes violence, the best way to reduce the crime
and violence would be to reduce the drug use. There is no
evidence that throwing people in prison is the most effective way
to reduce drug use. All the evidence shows that treatment and
education are more cost-effective. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization contend that if drugs were
legalized, crime and violence would decrease. They believe that
it is the illegal nature of drug production, trafficking and use
that fuels crime and violence. They state that turf wars, gang
activity and drugrelated crimes are the result of the illegal
nature of the drug trade. Proponents state that users commit
crimes to pay for drugs now because they cannot easily obtain
them. If drugs were legal, they say, the enormous profits
associated with drugs because of their illegal status would
evaporate and, once gone, the black market and criminal activity
associated with drugs would also be eliminated. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>If this was really the number one concern of the DEA then they
should be advocating tough prison sentences against alcohol. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Of all psychoactive substances, alcohol is the only one
        whose consumption has been shown to commonly increase
        aggression. . . . </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Alcohol drinking and violence are linked through
        pharmacological effects on behavior, through expectations
        that heavy drinking and violence go together in certain
        settings, and through patterns of binge drinking and
        fighting that sometimes develop in adolescence. . . . </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Illegal drugs and violence are linked primarily through
        drug marketing: disputes among rival distributors,
        arguments and robberies involving buyers and sellers,
        property crimes committed to raise drug money and, more
        speculatively, social and economic interactions between
        the illegal markets and the surrounding communities. . .

</ul>

<p><a href="../govpubs/psycviol.htm">Psychoactive Substances and
Violence</a>, published by the Department of Justice, Series:
Research in Brief, February 1994 </p>

<p>The image of the insanely violent drug user has been a common
argument for drug prohibition since the earliest days of the laws
when the New York Times published front page articles about
&quot;Negro Cocaine Fiends, New Southern Menace&quot;, and quoted
a sheriff saying, &quot;Those cocaine niggers sure are hard to
kill.&quot; (NY Times, February 17, 1914) It is an image which
has been used to justify the cruelest kinds of responses to
social problems, as shown by the sheriff's own words. It never
did have any basis in fact. </p>

<p>The Department of Justice's own research clearly shows that
the only real connection between illegal drugs and violence is
the violence created by the fact that it is illegal. This is the
same kind of violence that we saw with respect to alcohol
Prohibition with the wars between rival alcohol distributors. It
was during this period that the Thompson submachine gun became a
symbol of gangs and Prohibition. All of that ended when
Prohibition ended. Violent crime dropped 65 percent in the year
Prohibition was repealed and it continued to drop every year
thereafter until World War II. (Need citation from Ethan N. on
this one.) We could expect similar results from the repeal of
drug Prohibition. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Participants in the AntiLegalization Forum, who are experts in
crime and violence, disagreed strongly with the notion that crime
and violence would be reduced if drugs were legalized. It is
widely claimed by those advancing the case for legalization that
crime is largely committed by drug traffickers protecting their
turf. Sadly, it is the experience of many local police officers
that crime is committed not only because people want to buy
drugs, but more often because people use drugs. There is no
denying the fact that drug use changes behavior and exacerbates
criminal activity. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"

<p>The Department of Justice's own studies of the issue disagree.
See the information presented above. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The experts also believe that legalization will lead to
increased availability of drugs, which will, in turn, lead to
increased use. The use of drugs, especially cocaine, crack,
methamphetamine, and PCP is often associated with violent
criminal behavior. There is ample evidence which demonstrates the
links between drugs, violence and crime, and the links between a
currently legal substance--alcohol--and crime is well documented.
Police can attest to the fact that alcohol plays a significant
role in domestic violence cases. Drug use would only swell the
statistics regarding crime, even if the drugs were legally
purchased. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization proponents ignore the fact that the people
committing violent crimes are career criminals who will not stop
their illegal activities once drugs are legalized; they will
instead seek new sources of illicit revenue. Criminal activity
would not be reduced as a result of drug legalization any more
than gangster activity disappeared after the Repeal of
Prohibition. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is the argument that if we &quot;legalized&quot; drugs
then the criminals would just find another line of work. There is
nothing else which offers the opportunity to get rich so easily.
By comparison, all the other crimes are hard work. </p>

<p>The DEA says that criminal activity would not be
&quot;reduced&quot; because gangster activity did not
&quot;disappear&quot; after the repeal of Prohibition. Of course,
anyone who has seen &quot;The Untouchables&quot; should know that
gangster activity was significantly &quot;reduced&quot; after the
repeal of Prohibition, even if it did not &quot;disappear&quot;.
Therefore, we could expect similar results again. </p>

<p>This is an interesting argument. We must keep drugs illegal
because it gives work to criminals who might be doing something
more dangerous if we did not. That is, having these people sell
drugs is a good thing because it keeps them out of bigger
trouble. Relatively speaking then, selling drugs is not so bad as
other potential crimes so we should make sure they keep doing it.
</p>

<p>Of course, then the question becomes: What would happen if we
actually did stop the flow of drugs? Would we have to start
manufacturing drugs and distributing them through these same
criminals just to keep them from doing something worse in
society? </p>

<p>According to this argument, we are better off if the drug war
never does succeed. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The group discussed the fallacy that legalizing drugs would
eliminate the black market environment which seems to fuel the
drug trade and its attendant violence. The existence of a black
market is heavily dependent on the parameters set by the
legalizers: which drugs would be legal, the potency level of
drugs and the age at which legal drugs could be purchased. If
drugs were legal for persons over 18, for example, drug
traffickers would still target those 17 and younger; if only
marijuana were legalized, drug traffickers would continue to
traffic in heroin and cocaine. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Who do the drug traffickers target now? What drugs do they
traffic in now? </p>

<p>No sensible person pretends that any drug policy is going to
solve all the problems related to drugs. That is clearly
unrealistic. At the same time, there is no reason to undertake
policies, such as we have now, which only make the situation
worse. </p>

<p>Let's face it. The DEA never has had any effective control
over the drug markets and they never will. By taking this
approach the DEA has insured that only the outlaws will have
control of drug sales and distribution. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> A report in the Journal of the American Medical Association
(7/6/94) reports that cocaine use is linked to high rates of
homicide in New York City and that &quot;homicide victims may
have provoked violence through irritability, paranoid thinking or
verbal and physical aggression which are known to be
pharmacologic effects of cocaine.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DOJ's own studies, mentioned above, tell a different
story. </p>

<p>What the DEA is alluding to here in the last part of this
paragraph is the fact that people are more likely to be victims
or homicide than to be perpetrators of homicide while under the
influence of cocaine. The same statistic is true of alcohol. What
it means is that people who get stoned on anything sometimes do
stupid things, such as getting themselves killed. This is even
more true of alcohol, but does not make a good reason to throw
people in prison for drinking wine or beer. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> An April, 1994 report titled &quot;Violent Drug Related
Crime&quot; compiled by Drug and Crime Data Center and
Clearinghouse indicates that drugs are used by many offenders
committing crimes. In 1991, the following percentages of State
prison inmates involved in violent offenses reported that they
had used drugs at the time the offense was committed. </p>

<p>Violent Offenses: 28% </p>

<p>Homicide: 28% </p>

<p>Sexual Assault: 20% </p>

<p>Robbery: 38% </p>

<p>Assault 23% </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The Drug and Crime Data Center and Clearinghouse reports that
they have no publication with this title. The Sourcebook of
Criminal Justice Statistics of 1992 lists the breakdown of drug
use during commission of violent offenses. The figures shows
that, with the exception of robbery, about 75 to 90 percent of
all the reported drug use was use of alcohol, not illegal drugs.
For robbery, the figures are roughly equal. </p>

<p>People who commit violent crimes are likely to have a lot of
problems in their lives, including use of illegal drugs as well
as higher rates of use of alcohol and tobacco. That doesn't
necessarily mean that one problem is causally related to another.
</p>

<p>Even if we assumed, as the DEA implies, that all of this was
due to illegal drugs, they don't mention comparison data for the
number of people who took whatever drug and did not commit a
violent crime. </p>

<p>Even if we assumed the DEA is right, there is no evidence that
the best way to control the problem is to put people in prison. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Data from the National Institute of Justice (US Department
of Justice) Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program underscore the
crimedrugs link. Of a sample of males arrested in 24 US cities in
1991, the percent testing positive for at least one drug in the
DUF survey ranged from 36% in Omaha to 75% in San Diego. Among
female arrestees, the percent testing positive for any drug
ranged from 45% in San Antonio to 79% in Cleveland </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The data of the Drug Use Forecasting program is interesting
but it does not underscore the crime-drugs link. The data are
simply measures of the number of people arrested who had drugs in
their system. There is no similar comparative data on people who
were not arrested, or did not commit crimes. </p>

<p>It is also a long way from showing any causal relationship
between drugs and crime except, perhaps, for the fact that people
who are stupid enough to get severely drunk or stoned are prone
to do stupid things. That would not make it a good idea to have
drug prohibition any more than the fact that we arrest people who
are drunk and disorderly makes it a good idea to have alcohol
prohibition. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> A May 1993 Bureau of Justice Statistics report states that
&quot;Drug use was common among inmates serving time for
burglary, robbery or drug offenses. Among inmates serving a
sentence for burglary or robbery, about 6 in 10 inmates had used
drugs in the month before the arrest for the current offense, and
about 4 in 10 were under the influence at the time of the
offense.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The number of inmates who used drugs in the month before the
arrest is as irrelevant as the number who drank a beer during the
month before the arrest. </p>

<p>It should be noted that being under the influence of drugs is
a convenient excuse which seems to suit everybody involved in a
criminal prosecution. The defendant can plead that he wasn't
himself because he was out of his mind on drugs and thereby play
on the court's sympathies for leniency. The prosecutors can point
to another horrendous drug problem, which suits their interests
as well. </p>

width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The same study indicates that female inmates were more likely
than male inmates to have used drugs in the month before the
offense (54% versus 50%) and to have been under the influence at
the time of the offense (36% versus 31 %). </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"

imprison women who use drugs? </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Another finding of the study indicated that among 18-49 year
old males, those who had used alcohol, cannabis and cocaine at
some point during the past year were ten times more likely to
commit a violent act (26.1 percent versus 2.7 percent) than those
who used none of the above. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA conveniently ignores the fact that alcohol has the
highest association with violence and that cannabis (hemp) has
none. </p>

<p>The DEA contends that, because someone had a beer up to a year
ago, they are potentially violent today. </p>

<p>There is no evidence of a causal relationship here at all.
Even if there was, there is no evidence that prison would be the
best way to control drug use. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Mitchell S. Rosenthal, M.D., president of a major New York
City drug treatment center, Phoenix House, and chairman of the
New York State Advisory Council on Substance Abuse, notes that
one of the basic contentions of advocates of legalization is that
drug users are essentially normal people. Actually, Dr. Rosenthal
said in a speech in 1993, drugs undo the bounds that keep many
seemingly normal people on an even keel. &quot;The treatment
community does not contend that society is at risk from the
behavior of all drug abusers or even the great majority of
them,&quot; he said. &quot;The case for prohibition rests on the
substantial number of abusers who cross the line from permissible
self-destruction to become 'driven' people, who are 'out of
control' and put others in danger of their risk taking, violence,
abuse or HIV infection.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA argues that drug users are not &quot;essentially
normal people&quot;, even while they state that at least
two-thirds of them are gainfully employed taxpayers. </p>

<p>As for undoing &quot;the bounds that keep many seemingly
normal people on an even keel&quot; and all the other problems
mentioned, these problems are equally true of alcohol. Yet they
do not recommend that we bring back Prohibition of alcohol. </p>

<p>Again, the DEA attempts to lump all drugs together, as if they
all had the same effects. General statements about
&quot;all&quot; drugs are intentionally misleading. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> The International Association of Chiefs of Police published
a report in 1993 titled &quot;Violent Crime in America.&quot; It
states &quot;Drug abuse and crime, both violent and nonviolent,
are linked. National Crime Victimization surveys in 1989 and 1990
revealed over 2,000,000 crimes committed by offenders under the
influence of drugs or alcohol...this represented 36% and 34% of
total violent crime recorded by the surveys.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The important phrase here is &quot;drugs or alcohol&quot;. The
table below shows that alcohol's association with violent crime
is far greater than the association of all illegal drugs
combined. The biggest problem is alcohol, and yet no one is
suggesting that we have a war on booze. </p>

<p>Again, the DEA attempts to lump all drugs together as if they
were all equally responsible for the problems. It is
irresponsible and misleading to lump all drugs together,
particularly in view of the large role that alcohol plays in the
figures. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<h2>CLAIM II: WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN REDUCING DRUG
USE IN THIS COUNTRY. NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO ABANDON OUR EFFORTS. </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>No one has suggested that we should &quot;abandon&quot; our
efforts to reduce the problems associated with drugs. What we
have suggested is that we should make those efforts more
cost-effective. Prison is not cost effective. </p>

<p>Even if we accepted this claim as true, there is no evidence
that the progress in reducing drug use was at all due to the
number of people put in prison. In fact, the evidence clearly
shows that the number of people put in prison could not have had
enough of an impact on the average white, middle-class drug user
to make any difference at all in drug use. If there was any
actual reduction in drug use (and not just in
&quot;reported&quot; drug use) then it seems clear that it must
have been due to other factors. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization advocates claim that the fight against drugs has
not been won, and is, in fact, unwinnable. They frequently state
that people still take drugs, drugs are widely available, and
that the changing that fact is a lost cause. Legalization is the
alternative. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>It should be clear to anyone that the war on drugs has not
been won. There is no credible evidence anywhere which would
suggest that the war could be won by the current methods, and the
DEA has presented no such evidence here. The alternative is to
look for a better approach, whatever we might choose to call it. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The conference participants disagreed with the notion that we
should wave the white flag of surrender because people still take
drugs. The experts contended that there have been many positive
developments over the past fifteen years in reducing drug use,
and stated that the good news is often given short shrift. Our
drug problem did not happen overnight, and it will take a number
of years to eliminate the problem. Legalization is not an
alternative to combating the drug problem. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>As happened with Vietnam, there comes a point when must
recognize that we never should have taken this course in the
first place. It is not surrender to end the war on drugs, it is a
recognition of what we should have recognized years ago. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The United States faces a number of problems today which, like
our drug problem, are not susceptible to easy solutions,
including illegal immigration, declining education quality and
public health problems. Should we just post signs on our borders
that we've given up and invite a tide of immigrants in? Should we
declare that our education system has been a failure and give
children a permanent vacation from school? Should we throw up our
hands in frustration about AIDS and stop searching for a cure? Of
course not. Americans are a people committed to solving problems,
not running from them. Why should our commitment to stopping
drugs be any different from our approach to other national
interests? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>There is no doubt that there are many difficult problems. Of
all the problems mentioned, the DEA does not propose to solve any
of them by throwing people in prison. </p>

<p>The final question here asks for a commitment to
&quot;stopping drugs&quot; which, the DEA itself admits, is
clearly impossible. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Furthermore, ask proponents of legalization just what they are
proposing be legalized. Just marijuana? Marijuana and heroin? All
drugs? </p>

<p>And for what age group? Will children be able to buy drugs? </p>

<p>Will prescriptions be necessary? </p>

<p>And what will they tolerate as the price of legalization? A
permanent underclass of drug users? </p>

<p>Will a 10% increase in the number of traffic fatalities be
accepted? What about 50%? </p>

<p>Would they be relieved to know that their child care provider
had been smoking legally-purchased marijuana? How many
borderbabies is too many? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The question really is: for what drugs are we willing to throw
people in prison? </p>

<p>Can children buy drugs now? Obviously, they can because only
the outlaws control distribution of drugs. The questions try to
insinuate that people in favor of reform want to distribute drugs
to children. Nothing could be further from the truth. The
question also conveniently ignores the fact that the number one
drug killer, tobacco, is still freely available to children
through vending machines. </p>

<p>There are any number of possible policies, besides the current
one. The question of whether prescriptions would be necessary
should not stop us from recognizing that prison is unnecessary. </p>

<p>We already have a permanent underclass of drug users. </p>

<p>There is no evidence that the number of traffic fatalities
would change. About half of all traffic fatalities are now caused
by alcohol, but the DEA does not propose that arresting all the
people who drink beer or wine is a sensible solution. </p>

<p>The laws and social rules for things such as caring for
children would not change regardless of the legal status of any
drug. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> The 1993 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, released
in July, 1994, demonstrates unequivocally that drug use declined
significantly between 1979 and 1993. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The same figures show it is going back up again, particularly
among children. Those figures show large increases in the last
year alone -- and the laws have not changed. </p>

<p>It must also be recognized that the data gathering methods of
this survey are open to question. The survey is conducted by
calling people at random on the telephone and asking if anyone in
the household has committed a felony (used drugs) in the past few
weeks or months. Instead of an accurate measure of the amount of
drug use, it may just be a measure of the number of people who
are stupid enough to answer such a question from a stranger on
the phone. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> In 1993, an estimated 11.7 million Americans were current
illicit drug users, meaning they had used an illicit drug in the
month prior to the interview. This represents no change from 1992
when the estimate was 11.4 million. The number of illicit drug
users had been declining since its peak in 1979 at 24 million. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA needs to take elementary math again. The figures shown
represent a rise of 300,000 drug users. </p>

<p>The figures show one thing above all else-- there is no way we
can throw that many people in prison, and our jails are full
already. How many of these millions does the DEA propose that we
throw in prison? </p>

<p>The DEA's own figures also clearly show that all of the
supposed decline in drug use has been among casual drug users.
Their own figures show that this policy has had no effect on the
number of hard core drug users, where the problem really lies. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> The number of current cocaine users remained at 1.3 million
users in 1993, the same as 1992. This is down from a peak of 5.3
million in 1985. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Does the DEA suggest that we throw all 1.3 million cocaine
users in prison? </p>

<p>Since 1979, rates of current illicit drug use have dropped for
12 17 year olds, 1825 year olds, and 2634 year olds, but not for
the age group 35 and older. </p>

<p>The latest figures show that drug use among these groups has
risen dramatically again, and yet the laws are just as harsh as
they always were. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Teenage drug consumption, despite recent upturns, is down
in the long term. There is an obvious concern in the United
States about the consumption of drugs by teenagers--the adults of
tomorrow. Recent upturns demonstrate to us the clear need to
continue doing what we've done for more than the past decade:
combine law enforcement, education, and international efforts to
address all aspects of the drug situation. The Monitoring the
Future Study, conducted annually by University of Michigan
research scientists for the US Department of Health and Human
Services, has been tracking the drug consumption of American high
school seniors since the 1970s. In the past few years, the study
has been broadened to embrace drug use by 10th grade and 8th
grade students as well. </p>

<p><a name="DDE_LINK10"><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif"

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is obviously wrong. See the latest figures cited above. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>When the first Monitoring the Future Study was published, 27.1
% of the members of the Class of 1975 (eighth and 10th graders

in the previous month. The figure for the Class of 1980 was
33.7%--which puts that 2.4% figure 13 years later into
perspective. </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>If the study is looking at the drug use of eighth to tenth
graders then it would seem obvious enough that the campaign to
put people in prison would not have had much real effect on this
group. This is evidence that any drop in use was not due to
tougher criminal enforcement. </p>

<h2>CLAIM III: LEGALIZATION OF DRUGS WILL LEAD TO INCREASED USE
AND INCREASED ADDICTION LEVELS </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>A cornerstone of the legalization proponents' position is the
claim that making illegal drugs legal would not cause more of
these substances to be consumed, nor would addiction increase.
They claim that many people can use drugs in moderation and that
many would choose not to use drugs, just as many forego alcohol
and tobacco now. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Every major study of drug policy agreed that there is no
evidence that drug use would increase with more sensible
policies. In fact, they found that drug use would probably
decrease with more sensible policies. </p>

<p>They also found that, even if drug use did increase,
decriminalization would still be a better approach simply because
of all the harm caused by the current policy. See the list of the
Biggest Studies of Drug Policy, also on these web pages. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Participants in the AntiLegalization Forum felt strongly that
when drugs are more widely available--as they certainly would be
if they were legalized--rates of use and addiction would
increase. </p>

<p>Legalizing drugs sends a message that drug use (like tobacco
and alcohol) is acceptable, and encourages drug use among people
who currently do not use drugs. </p>

<p>When the social taboos about premarital sex were removed, the
nation's illegitimate birthrate soared. And we are paying dearly
for it. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>All of the arguments here depend upon what you mean by
&quot;legalized&quot;. </p>

<p>No, it does not send any such message, and our society's
campaigns against tobacco are perhaps the best example. And of
course, the real question is: How many millions of people do we
have to put in prison to show the right amount of disapproval? </p>

<p>This is a &quot;TV-talk-show&quot; argument, which blithely
ignores the fact that the illegitimate birth rate is due to
problems much more complex than the taboo on premarital sex. </p>

<p>Does this mean that, as a solution, the DEA is proposing that
we throw people in prison for premarital sex? There are lots of
ways to discourage something without throwing people in prison. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Look to our history. For years, the United States legally
refined morphine from opium, and hailed it as a miracle drug.
Many soldiers on both sides of the Civil War who were given
morphine for their wounds became addicted to it. Are we ready for
more morphine addicts? Crack addicts? Heroin addicts? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Morphine was first refined when many battle wounds were
treated with simple amputation without anesthesia and a doctor
was considered a good surgeon if he could do the amputation
quickly to minimize the pain. In the medical context of that type
of &quot;surgery&quot; and the fact that there were no
antibiotics to control infections, morphine was a real miracle
drug because it relieved a great deal of suffering. </p>

<p>The figures differ on the number of Civil War veterans who
became addicts, partly because of the difficulty in defining what
an addict is. There was widespread use of these drugs simply
because there were no regulations at all during this period and
they were included in many common patent medicines, including
remedies for baby colic. There is no evidence that the Civil War
veterans who became addicts were any more of a problem to society
than a modern tobacco addict. The 1905 Pure Food and Drug Act was
the first law to require manufacturers to state the contents of
their mixtures on the label. This was clearly a good law because
it helped consumers make an informed decision. Drug use declined
steadily between the time the law was passed and 1914, when the
Harrison Narcotics Act was passed. See any of the major studies
listed elsewhere in this book for a more complete history of the
subject. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Early in the 20th Century, drugs were plentiful, cheap, and
legal in the United States. Some could even be bought from the
Sears Catalogue. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is true. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>But Americans realized that these legalized drugs were harmful
to individuals and society, and drug laws were written. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is not true. The reasons were more complex than this and
were largely based on racism and ignorance. No evidence was
presented to Congress to show that prohibition was either
necessary or desirable. No evidence was even presented to show
that these drugs were even medically harmful. In the case of
cocaine and the opiates, it is doubtful if Congress realized it
was passing what would be regarded as a general prohibition on
these drugs because it was phrased as a tax act. In the case of
marijuana (hemp) it is clear that most members of Congress did
not realize that they were passing a law to prohibit the most
common crop in America. These laws were a hoax from the very
begining. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>CocaCola took the coca out of its popular soft drink and
substituted caffeine. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is true. The original name of Coca-Cola was &quot;French
Wine of Coca -- Invigorating Tonic&quot;. It is also true that
there was a campaign to outlaw caffeine for the same reasons that
cocaine was outlawed. That campaign died when it was realized
that caffeine was contained in too many common foods, such as
coffee, tea, and chocolate. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization proponents would have them put it back, and make
opium as available as chewing gum. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is a flat-out lie and a cheap, deliberate attempt to
distort the arguments. It shows that the DEA has set up
&quot;legalization&quot; as a straw man, defined in their own
extreme terms. We do not agree with this extreme policy, or the
DEA's extreme definition of &quot;legalization&quot;. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>More recently Alaska decriminalized the personal use of small
amounts of marijuana in the home. The experiment did not turn out
the way legalization proponents had predicted. Although the legal
age for using marijuana was 19, adolescents as young as 12 years
old were using the drug. Alaskans eventually came to the
realization that decriminalization did not work, and voted to
overturn the law. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Twelve-year-olds using marijuana (hemp) is nothing new. I
observed pre-teens using marijuana (hemp) more than twenty-five
years ago, and it appeared to me that it was fairly common among
children of that age. Decriminalization in any area has never
been shown to have any real effect on the use patterns of
marijuana. </p>

<p>The law was overturned because of a massive campaign headed by
then-Drug-Czar William Bennett as one of the cornerstones of his
campaigns against the evils of drugs. Bennett, at the time, was a
tobacco addict. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The experts believe that legalization of drugs would decrease
the perception of risk currently associated with drug use. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Let's assume that the DEA experts are right. How many millions
of people do we have to put in prison to create the proper
perception of risk? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The group strongly endorsed the notion that the Government
should help protect people from substances and activities that
are harmful to themselves the community and society at large. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>So why aren't we throwing people in prison for alcohol or
tobacco? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> Dr. Herbert Kleber, prominent psychiatrist from Yale
University, former Demand Reduction Deputy Director at the Office
of National Drug Control Policy and currently with the Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, states in a
1994 article in the New England Journal of Medicine that clinical
data support the premise that drug use would increase with
legalization. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Dr. Kleber does not define what he means by
&quot;legalization.&quot; There are any number of different
policies which could be defined as &quot;legalization,&quot; each
of which could have widely varying effects. Therefore, all the
rest of his statements on the subject are essentially
meaningless. Even if he did define what he means by
&quot;legalization&quot;, it is not the only option we have for
drug policy. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>He says: &quot;There are over 50 million nicotine addicts, 18
million alcoholics or problem drinkers, and fewer than 2 million
cocaine addicts in the United States. Cocaine is a much more
addictive drug than alcohol. If cocaine were legally available,
as alcohol and nicotine are now, the number of cocaine abusers
would probably rise to a point somewhere between the number of
users of the other two agents, perhaps 20 to 25 million...the
number of compulsive users might be nine times higher...than the
current number. When drugs have been widely available--as...
cocaine was at the turn of the century--both use and addiction
have risen &quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>See the table below for the latest ratings on the relative
addictive qualities of drugs. </p>

<p>Dr. Kleber does not suggest that the most productive approach
to the 50 million nicotine addicts, or the 18 million alcoholics,
is to put alcohol or tobacco users in prison. Why not? </p>

<p>Drug use was widespread at the turn of the century. This
statement ignores the fact that drug use and addiction fell
steadily after manufacturers were required to list the
ingredients in their products. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> England's experience with widely available heroin shows
that use and addiction increase. Great Britain allowed doctors to
prescribe heroin to addicts. There was an explosion of heroin use
and by the mid-1980s known addiction rates were increasing by
about 30% a year. According to the Lancet, the wellrespected
medical journal (Lancet, January 9, 1982), 2,657 heroin addicts
were registered in 1970 compared with 5,107 in 1980. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>By the mid-1980's Great Britain was fully into the American
style drug war so it is apparent that, if there is any connection
between the drug war and addiction, the drug war must have made
the problem worse. </p>

<p>It is also worthwhile to note that the figures show that the
number of heroin addicts doubled in ten years, but the numbers
were still trivial in comparison to the number of addicts in any
comparable segment of the United States. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>This was a program in which heroin users needed a doctor's
authorization to get their drug. What would happen if anyone
wanting to try heroin could simply buy it at the government
store? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The vast majority of them would throw up after using it and
find they really didn't like the effects. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Alaska tried the legalization experiment and abandoned it.
Legalization was given a lengthy try closer to home when the
Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 1975 that the state could not
interfere with a person's possession of marijuana in his home for
personal use. Enforcement was permitted only when the quantity
possessed exceeded four ounces--this in a state that, because of
the long, sunny days of its brief growing season, produces extra
potent marijuana. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Alaska's ruling applied to personal possession of hemp
(marijuana) and use within the confines of one's own home. This
is a far cry from the &quot;legalization&quot; the DEA talks
about elsewhere. The court decided that the right of privacy
protected the citizen's rights within their own home. </p>

<p>All states are capable of producing extra potent marijuana.
Alaska is nothing special in this regard. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The court's ruling was interpreted by many Alaskans as a
signal to light up, and so they did, especially the young ones,
even though the ruling was limited to persons 19 and over.
According to a 1988 University of Alaska study, the state's 12 to
17yearolds used marijuana at more than twice the national average
for their age group. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>It is ludicrous to state that an Alaskan Supreme Court
decision would be interpreted by anyone as a &quot;signal to
light up.&quot; It is highly doubtful if teenagers govern their
behavior based on Supreme Court decisions. Anyone who wants to
use a drug is going to do so regardless of what the Supreme Court
may have said about it. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>&quot;The frequency with which marijuana was used within the
current sample,&quot; the report on the study said,
&quot;suggests that it is not an experimental event for many
students, but that it seems to have become well incorporated into
the lifestyle of many adolescents.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>And the DEA suggests that the best way to improve these
students lives is to hunt them down and put them in jail to cure
them of their lifestyle. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Although they historically cling to their personal liberties,
Alaska residents voted in 1990 to recriminalize possession of
marijuana, demonstrating their belief that increased use was too
high a price to pay for increased personal liberties. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>A referendum was passed in 1990 by Alaska voters which
attempted to overturn the Alaska Supreme Court decision. The
referendum was the result of an intensive, well-funded campaign
by then-Drug Czar William Bennett and other drug wars to remove a
major embarrassment to their cause -- the fact that Alaska had
protected private use of marijuana and Alaskan society had not
fallen apart as a result. The courts later threw out the vote
because the issue had been decided on a matter of basic
constitutional protections of privacy, which cannot be voted away
under Alaskan law. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Will the public support an aggressive marketing approach?
While &quot;government drugs&quot; could conceivably be priced
low enough, perhaps by having taxpayers subsidize them to
discourage a black market, the combination of low price and ready
availability would bring more consumption, more addiction. We
would have won the battle and lost the war. If they see this as
the probable outcome, the American people can hardly be expected
to endorse a &quot;sell at all costs&quot; policy. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Why should there be an aggressive marketing approach? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Robert L. DuPont, M.D., former director of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, considered the impact legalization would
have on use and addiction rates in a paper published in 1994. </p>

<p>&quot;Would legalization increase the number of drug users and
the social harm produced by the use of drugs?&quot; Dr. DuPont
asked. &quot;The answer to those two questions is simply, 'Yes,
it would.&quot;' </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The answer to this question is simply: What
&quot;legalization&quot; are you talking about? Until you define
what you mean by &quot;legalization&quot; you can't define what
the likely effect on the number of drug users and social harm. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The current global experience with alcohol and tobacco reveals
the downside of legalization clearly, Dr. DuPont said. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is certainly true, keeping in mind the fact these drugs
are only legal under certain conditions. Despite this, Dr. DuPont
is not suggesting that we outlaw alcohol and tobacco as the most
appropriate response. Why not? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>&quot;Legalization of any drugs leads to large increases in
the use of the legalized drugs,&quot; he said. &quot;Because most
of the social costs of drugs are not the costs of prohibition but
the costs created by the drug use itself (a point proved beyond
dispute by the dismal global experience with alcohol and
tobacco), legalization raises the net social costs of drug use. </p>

<p><a name="DDE_LINK12"><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif"
align="bottom" width="562" height="19"></a><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Even if we assumed this to be true, every major study of drug
policy has said that the cost of the current policy far outweighs
the other potential costs. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>&quot;Legalization is an old, siren call which promises to
reduce the high costs of drug use, but which abundant evidence
shows would inevitably raise the costs society pays for drug use,
not reduce them. We do not need new experiments to make <br>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<h2>CLAIM IV: ANY REVENUES GENERATED BY TAXING LEGALIZED DRUGS
WOULD QUICKLY EVAPORATE IN LIGHT OF THE INCREASED SOCIAL COSTS
ASSOCIATED WITH LEGALIZING DRUGS. </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>A favorite argument in support of legalization is that
education, health care, road building and a wide array of other
worthwhile causes would benefit from the taxes that could be
raised by legalizing drugs and then taxing them. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>On the whole, it certainly seems better than sending all that
money to Colombia. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The conference participants were extremely skeptical about the
claim of a large tax windfall, and challenged advocates to prove
that the amounts of revenue potentially generated by legalization
would counterbalance the increased social costs that would result
from making drugs legal. When asked for specifics, they have no
answers. </p>

<p>Are they taking into account the erosion of the tax base as
more and more citizens are unable to work because of drug
addiction? Add to this loss the cost of health and welfare
benefits for the unemployed. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>There is no tax windfall, large or small, right now. The only
revenue generated is the revenue generated from money and
property seizures, which is fraught with its own problems. </p>

<p>The DEA has asked the American taxpayers to support an
open-ended program of building more prisons. When they are asked
for specifics, such as how many prisons they propose to build,
they have no answers. </p>

<p>Does the DEA take into account the erosion of the tax bases by
the fact that -- by their own estimates -- two-thirds of the
people they propose to throw in prison are gainfully employed
taxpayers? Does the DEA take into account the fact that, once
these people have a prison record, they may be permanently
unemployed because no one wants to hire an ex-convict? Putting
people in prison doesn't do anything to reduce unemployment
problems, except for prison guards. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Health and societal costs of drug legalization would increase.
The panel predicted that drug treatment costs, hospitalization
for longterm drug related disease, and treatment of the
consequences of family violence would further burden our already
strapped health care system. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"

<p>Every major study of drug policy disagreed with this point.
See the list elsewhere on these pages. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>There is also real reason to believe that liability suits
would be brought against manufacturers and distributors of drugs
as damages to individuals increased, thereby increasing the cost
of products. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>As opposed to the current situation, where there is no one to
bring a liability suit against. </p>

<p>Liability suits have not yet put the alcohol and tobacco
industries out of business, or made their products too expensive.
If this was a real concern, alcohol and tobacco would still be
the major concerns. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Ask legalization proponents if the alleged profits from drug
legalization would be enough to pay for the increased fetal
defects, loss of workforce productivity, increased traffic
fatalities and industrial accidents, increased domestic violence
and the myriad other problems that would not only be high income
items, but extremely expensive in terms of social decay. How much
are they willing to pay? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The number of fetal defects caused by alcohol are far greater
than the number for illegal drugs so this argument is a red
herring. If the DEA was really concerned about fetal defects,
they would concentrate on alcohol first. </p>

<p>The DEA acts like these problems are not here already, and
that the best method of preventing them is to throw people in
prison. In every case, these problems are already here, and
throwing people in prison is not the best approach to the
problem. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p>Dr. William Olson, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
for International Narcotics Matters, outlines the magnitude of
the social costs borne now by U.S. taxpayers because of drugs. In
his 1994 essay, &quot;Drug Legalization: Getting to No,&quot; he
provides the following: </p>

<p> 2560 percent of the homeless are addicts, whose
homelessness is in large part the result of addiction and their
inability to manage money or make rational, reasonable decisions.
They are increasingly supported at public expense. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is the result of the current policy which is, in itself,
a good argument against what we are doing. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> 7580 percent of the 1.2 1.5 million teenage runaways are
substance abusers, and not because prohibition made them use
drugs or run away. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>No, and prohibition didn't keep them from using drugs either.
Runaways are usually children who have severe problems at home
which cause them to engage in all sorts of deviant behavior. The
drug laws do not do anything to address the underlying problem.
The law only makes the runaways' problems worse if they are
caught using drugs. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> 3050 percent of mental patients are chemical abusers, 5060
percent of these crack and cocaine. They are largely on public
support. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The only thing this would show is that people with severe
mental problems are likely to try to self-medicate themselves. It
does not show any causal connection between drug use and
insanity, except perhaps that insanity causes greater drug use.
It says even less about what would a sensible public policy for
addressing the problem. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> As many as 11 percent of young mothers use drugs during
pregnancy. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"

<p>This is what is happening under the current system. A more
sensible approach might reduce the number. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> 2.5 percent of all live births, some 100,000 babies are
born addicted to cocaine. They have lifelong learning
disabilities and emotional problems. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"

<p>There is no support for this claim at all and the DEA knows
it. The DEA is lying. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> $50 billion is devoted annually to dealing with the health
care costs of drug addiction and its collateral costs. These will
not disappear with legalization. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Those costs haven't disappeared with prohibition either. In
fact, every major study of the subject says that prohibition only
makes those costs greater. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> There are approximately 500,000 heroin and 2 million other
substance abusers. Their care is increasingly a demand on
society. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>According to the DEA's own figures, shown above, the current
policies have had no effect on this problem at all. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> There is no way to predict how much revenue would be
generated by the United States Government taxing legalized drugs.
Such a scenario depends entirely upon the parameters of
legalization, and what the policy means vis a vis sources of
drugs. If U.S. farmers were given subsidies to produce drugs (as
they are given subsidies for tobacco) the U.S. taxpayers would be
responsible for paying for these subsidies. If foreign sources of
drugs (opium or coca) were allowed to supply the raw material for
these products, an elaborate system of tariffs and trade
preferences would need to be established. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>It is true that there is no way to predict tax revenues until
one makes some assumptions about &quot;legalization&quot;. One of
the reasons is that the DEA doesn't have a clue how big the
market for drugs really is. This should not stop us from
recognizing that prison is a net revenue loser. </p>

<p>These are curious arguments. They bring up the question of
whether we should have subsidies for tobacco in the first place,
especially in view of the fact that it kills 100 times as many
people as all the illegal drugs combined. Why does our government
give subsidies to tobacco farmers while it throws marijuana
(hemp) farmers in prison? Our drug laws plainly make no sense at
all. </p>

<p>Trade and tariffs would be handled as they would for any other
commodity and the fact that tariffs might be complicated is not a
good argument for throwing American citizens in prison. </p>

<p>We also have to ask, who controls the trade and tariffs now?
And what are the trade and tariff rules now? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Taxes would likely push the cost of the product up. Taxing
the drugs would make them more expensive at the checkout counter.
The drug cartels do not provide a share of their receipts to
their respective governments. They are all business. Anyone going
into competition with them, including the U.S. Government, would
have to be all business too, prepared to cut prices, if
necessary, to stay in the game. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Prohibition pushes the cost of the product up. The main
difference would be that the revenues would not be used to fund
other crime. </p>

<p>The same arguments were equally true of alcohol during alcohol
Prohibition. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Legalized gambling has not put illegal gambling out of
business. In fact, legalized gambling has produced a whole new
group of people who cannot control their need to gamble. Many
states have gone into the gambling business to raise funds for
public purposes, with some success, although as more
jurisdictions get into it the profits decline. Meanwhile, bookies
ply their trade as they always have. The reason is the payoff
they offer is better than the legal gambling schemes. For every
million dollars wagered, that is, they return a higher percentage
to the winners. Again, it' s a matter of overhead. The bookies
are not trying to build schools, so they don't have to earmark a
percentage of the profits for such endeavors. So long as that is
so, they will always have a market that is loyal to them. The
same situation could logically occur if drugs were legal. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>And prohibition has not put the drug dealers out of business,
it has only made them richer. </p>

<p>In places where gambling is legal, illegal bookies do not have
higher payoffs than the legal gambling schemes, except in the
case of state lotteries which have notoriously poor payoff
percentages. </p>

<p>No one contends that any scheme will entirely eliminate the
black market in drugs, and the current policy is the best
example. However, a better policy could greatly reduce many of
the problems associated with the black market, as happened with
the repeal of alcohol Prohibition. <br>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<h2>CLAIM V: THERE ARE NO COMPELLING MEDICAL REASONS TO PRESCRIBE
MARIJUANA OR HEROIN TO SICK PEOPLE. </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>It is quite easy to refute this argument for both drugs. </p>

<p>Medically speaking, heroin is simply a stronger form of
morphine. Therefore, if there is a legitimate medical use for
morphine, then there is a legitimate medical use for heroin.
Heroin was once used medically in a manner similar to morphine
and was even used for pain relief during childbirth. Doctors
state that heroin is a good drug for medical use because it is
safe, powerful, and short acting. Recent research indicates that
pain-killers can be important healing agents after patients
undergo major surgery, because these drugs reduce the stress on
the central nervous system. In some cases, the amount of time
required to heal can be cut in half. Some research shows that the
best doses of morphine are perhaps ten times what they were
considered to be just a decade ago. </p>

<p>In the case of marijuana (hemp), there is already an approved
prescription drug, Marinol, which is derived from the primary
active ingredient in marijuana and used for the conditions for
which marijuana (hemp) is recommended. Marijuana (hemp) itself
would not be approved as a prescription drug because of FDA rules
which state that a medicine must consist of only the active
ingredients and a filler. Therefore, the rules themselves
prohibit the approval of any natural substances such as a plant,
even though the active ingredients in the plant and the
prescription drug are precisely the same. </p>

<p>The question then becomes, why should a sick person pay sixty
dollars a pill when they can grow the same medicine in their own
backyard for free? </p>

<p>Some patients report that the homegrown version of the
medicine is far superior to the prescription version for a couple
of reasons. One reason is that marijuana (hemp) is often used to
treat nausea and it is often hard to keep pills in their stomach
when they have nausea. Some of them have complained that it is
awfully depressing to vomit up a sixty dollar pill. Therefore, it
is better if the medicine is smoked because it bypasses the
stomach and gets the medicine into the body much more quickly.
Another reason that some sick people prefer marijuana (hemp) over
Marinol is that Marinol makes them &quot;higher than a
kite&quot;, and they don't want to be high, they just want their
medical symptoms relieved. By smoking marijuana (hemp), they can
limit the amount of &quot;high&quot; they get. </p>

<p>Marijuana (hemp) has traditionally been used in medicines for
thousands of years. Prior to 1937, it was the most common
agricultural crop in America and was used for literally thousands
of purposes, including rope, cloth, paper, fuel, and medicine. It
was prescribed for a wide variety of ailments and was included in
up to two-thirds of all over the counter preparations. Prior to
1937, cannabis (hemp) was completely unregulated and it would
have been impossible to regulate cannabis (hemp) because it was a
major agricultural crop grown nearly everywhere. Cannabis (hemp)
derivatives were included in a wide variety of items consumed by
the general public. Despite this widespread, unregulated
consumption, there were no reported problems. The American
Medical Association was opposed to the marijuana (hemp) laws in
1937 for these reasons. The promoters of these laws openly lied
about the AMA's attitude toward the law in order to get it
passed. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>It is often suggested that, even if currently controlled
substances are not made available to the general public, some of
them, particularly marijuana and heroin, could be used to relieve
suffering. </p>

<p>Participants in the AntiLegalization Forum acknowledged that
arguments urging the medical use of marijuana are often used as
an entree into the legalization debate. Medical use arguments can
garner public support because they seem harmless enough to the
uninformed audience. The experts agreed that these issues are
peripheral to the real issue. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA has no business making decisions or statements about
the proper medical use of anything. The fact that they do is only
one more example of what is wrong with our current drug policy. </p>

<p>There should be no argument at all that it is up to the
medical profession and its patients to define what is, or is not,
a proper medical treatment. The police do not have the required
professional knowledge to determine proper medical uses, they do
not know what difficulties individual patients may face in their
treatment or what benefits patients might receive, and they care
even less. It is absurd to pretend that complex medical decisions
can be made for every patient in the United States by an
organization such as the DEA. </p>

<p>The problem goes beyond the illegal drugs such as marijuana
and heroin. The problem extends to pain killers of all types in
general. The severity of this problem was seen in the recent case
of Florida versus Martinez. </p>

<p>Mr. Martinez was a lay AIDS counselor who ran a drug buyers
club for AIDS patients. A drug buyers club purchases medical
drugs which are available in other countries but not in the
United States and distributes them to sick people here. Mr.
Martinez was charged with distributing morphine without medical
training or a license. </p>

<p>Mr. Martinez did not deny the fact that he distributed
morphine to people and that he was in violation of the drug laws.
His only defense was that his actions were a medical necessity,
because of the barbaric policies of the DEA against people who
were in pain. The defense brought forth experts who testified how
the DEA had prosecuted and imprisoned doctors for prescribing
Tylenol 3 -- Tylenol with codeine -- a drug which is not even a
prescription drug except in the United States and South Africa,
and the US is the only control in the world which has ever sent a
doctor to prison for prescribing it. They testified about AIDS
patients who suffer from a nerve degeneration all over their body
which makes them scream in pain every time they are even touched.
For many of them, a simple bath can be painful beyond belief, and
yet they cannot get pain medication because their doctors are
often afraid to prescribe it because they fear what the DEA could
do to them. </p>

<p>After the jury heard the evidence on the government's drug
policy, they voted unanimously for acquittal. This trial was
shown on Court TV and has been repeated many times because it is
one of the most interesting trials they have ever shown. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The medical pros and cons of prescribing marijuana and heroin
to sick people are best debated by medical professionals. It
should be kept in mind, however, that marijuana has been rejected
as medicine by the American Medical Society, the American
Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the
International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies, and the
American Cancer Society. </p>

<p>HHS report </p>

<p>Not one American health association accepts marijuana as
medicine. Statements issued by these organizations express
concern over the harmful effects of the drugs and over the lack
of solid research demonstrating that they might do more good than
harm. </p>

<p>The International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies,
for instance, said in a statement issued by its Therapeutic
Claims Committee in 1992: &quot;Further studies are required to
determine whether marijuana has a clinically useful effect on
multiple sclerosis. In view of the possible toxic effects of
longterm use, its use cannot be recommended. In the opinion of
the committee, there appears to be no generally accepted
scientific basis for use of this therapy. It has never been
tested in a properly controlled trial. Longterm use may be
associated with significant serious side effects.&quot; </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> Under the federal statute known as the Controlled
Substances Act, regulated drugs are divided into categories known
as schedules. In Schedule I, for instance, are drugs with a high
potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use in
treatment in the United States. At the other end of the spectrum
is Schedule V, which is for drugs that have a low potential for
abuse and have a currently accepted medical use in treatment in
the United States. The Act provides a mechanism for substances to
be controlled (added to a schedule), decontrolled (removed from
control), or rescheduled (transferred from one schedule to
another). </p>

<p>Heroin and marijuana are in Schedule I; cocaine, which is
sometimes used as a local anesthetic, is in Schedule II. Much of
the debate about medical uses for currently illegal drugs
concerns substituting heroin for morphine and supplying marijuana
to AIDS and glaucoma patients or using it to treat side effects
of chemotherapy. </p>

<p> A petition to put marijuana in a less restrictive schedule
of the CSA was rejected by then DEA Administrator John C. Lawn,
after public hearings, on December 29, 1989. The United States
Court of Appeals ordered further proceedings, however, to clear
up what it felt were some ambiguities in the record.
Administrator Robert C. Bonner, who succeeded Lawn, complied and
issued a new ruling on March 26, 1992. &quot;By any modern
scientific standard, marijuana is no medicine, &quot; Bonner
said. The three judge appeals court upheld the ruling unanimously
on February 18, 1994. &quot;Our review of the record convinces us
that the Administrator's findings are supported by substantial
evidence,&quot; the court said, noting the &quot;testimony of
numerous experts that marijuana' s medicinal value has never been
proven in sound scientific studies.&quot; <br>

<h2>CLAIM VI: LEGALIZATION AND DECRIMINALIZATION OF DRUGS HAVE
BEEN A DISMAL FAILURE IN OTHER NATIONS. </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> <br>
</h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The experiences of a number of foreign countries including
Great Britain, the Netherlands and Switzerland are often cited to
demonstrate that other nations have successfully controlled drug
use by offering access and areas where drug takers can obtain and
use drugs. Recently, an MTV documentary on the drug issue
highlighted coffeehouses in Amsterdam as a model for controlled,
successful environment in which young Europeans can enjoy
marijuana. </p>

<p>There was also a 60 Minutes segment on the drug clinics in
Liverpool, England, a special on the Arts &amp; Entertainment
Channel, and a special on ABC which explored the situation in
Europe. </p>

<p>Legalization proponents cannot find encouragement in the fact
that when drugs were once legal, cheap and available in the
United States, the impact on society was such that laws were
enacted to make drugs illegal. They ignore our own history and
point to Great Britain, the Netherlands and Switzerland as free
and open societies where drug use is allowed with no adverse
effects. The Quantico experts believed it is important to shed
light on the foreign experience with increased drug access and
liberalized use policies, and explain that this experience has
been negative </p>

<p>The statement of our own history is plainly false. Interested
readers should any of the major studies of drug policy listed in
this book. </p>

<p>England tried prescribing heroin but gave it up. Until the
mid1960s, British physicians were allowed to prescribe heroin to
certain classes of addicts. After this experiment, according to
James Q. Wilson in his 1990 article &quot;Against the
Legalization of Drugs&quot;, &quot;a youthful drug culture
emerged with a demand for drugs far different from that of the
older addicts.&quot; </p>

<p>The British system didn't work. Addiction levels rose,
especially among teenagers, and many addicts chose to boycott the
program and continued to get their heroin from pushers. </p>

<p>In 1983, England began switching over to methadone and stopped
dispensing heroin from the clinics, and that caused even more
addicts to depart in favor of the real thing. According to the
late John Kaplan of Stanford University, the number of addicts
increased fivefold. James Q. Wilson states that the British
Government's experiment with controlled heroin distribution
resulted in, at a minimum, a 30fold increase in the number of
addicts in ten years. </p>

<p>The Netherlands, despite its controlled program, is having
troubles. Under the socalled &quot;expediency principle&quot;
Dutch law protects individuals from prosecution for acts that are
technically illegal, including the retaillevel sales and purchase
of marijuana and hashish. Dutch police are also instructed to
ignore streetlevel sales of all types of drugs. </p>

<p>The Amsterdam Municipal Health Service showed a rise in
hardcore addicts in 1992, attributable to a significant rise in
the local heroin supply which led to a price drop of as much as
75%. </p>

<p>Switzerland has become a magnet for drug users the world over.
One thing small European nations have learned is a little
tolerance about drugs brings a lot of unwelcome visitors. In
1987, Zurich permitted drug use and sales in a part of the city
called the &quot;Platzspitz&quot;, dubbed &quot;Needle
Park.&quot; Five years later the experiment was curtailed after
an influx of addicts and increased violence and deaths. In 1992,
Zurich Municipal spokesman Andres Ohler told the New York Times
that the number of regular drug users at the park had swelled
from a few hundred in 1987 to 20,000 by 1992. After the
Platzspitz closed, the price of heroin reportedly doubled. </p>

<p>RESOLUTION </p>

<p>EUROPEAN CITIES </p>

<p>AGAINST DRUGS </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>A number of European cities have taken the initiative of
organizing a Conference </p>

<p>for Cities Against the Legalization of Drugs. One of the aims
of the conference is </p>

<p>to adopt a resolution to enable towns that have not
participated in the conference to </p>

<p>support its work. </p>

<p>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. The tide of the
drug policy debate began to turn against the DEA with the advent
of the Resolution for a Federal Commission on Drug Policy
(sometimes referred to as the Hoover Resolution). A copy of this
Resolution and a list of some of the major signers is included in
this book. </p>

<p>The purpose of the conference is to increase cooperation
between cities, to provide </p>

<p>inspiration and hope for areas with particularly difficult
drug problems. The signatories to the resolution will affirm
their decision to fight against the spread of drugs. </p>

<p>The DEA apparently thought the Resolution for a Federal
Commission on Drug Policy was so important that they figured they
had to trump up something to counter it. The result is this
really phony and poorly worded resolution against drugs. It is
notable that the DEA did not name any of the people who signed
this resolution on behalf of their entire city. </p>

<p>STOCKHOLM  28TH APRIL 1994 </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> In April, 1994, a number of European cities signed a
resolution titled &quot;European Cities Against Drugs,&quot;
commonly known as the Stockholm resolution. It states: &quot;The
demands to legalize illicit drugs should be seen against the
background of current problems, which have led to a feeling of
helplessness. For many, the only way to cope is to try to
administer the current situation. But the answer does not lie in
making harmful drugs more accessible, cheaper and socially
acceptable. Attempts to do this have not proved successful. We
believe that legalizing drugs will, in the long term, increase
our problems. By making them legal, society will signal that it
has resigned to the acceptance of drug abuse. The signatories to
this resolution therefore want to make their position clear by
rejecting the proposals to legalize illicit drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>It is interesting to note the differences between the
Resolution for a Federal Commission on Drug Policy and this
resolution. The biggest difference is that the Resolution for a
Federal Commission on Drug Policy does not say anything about
&quot;legalization&quot; but simply asks for an objective review
of the evidence. The DEA's resolution does not call for any
objective review of the evidence and, in fact, rejecting even the
idea of a discussion of alternatives. </p>

<p>Pointing to the appropriate international treaties which
require nations to &quot;protect children from the illicit use of
narcotic drugs,&quot; the signatories state that they
&quot;reject all demands for legalizing illicit drugs... We
request that our Governments respect and with determination apply
those conventions and agreements regarding drugs which they have
signed.&quot; </p>

<p>Again, the DEA's resolution calls for a blind rejection of any
ideas but there own, without consideration of any evidence. </p>

<p>The cities signing this resolution include: Berlin, Stockholm,
Budapest, Dublin, Gdansk (Poland), Gothenburg (Sweden), Helsinki,
Paris, Lugano (Switzerland), Madrid, Malmo (Sweden), Moscow,
Oslo, Prague, London, Reykjavik (Iceland), Riga (Latvia), St.
Petersburg (Russia), Tallinn (Estonia), Valletta (Malta) and
Warsaw. </p>

<p>It is notable that the DEA does not mention who in these
cities signed on behalf of the entire city. It is also notable
that many of the cities are former Soviet Union cities with
little experience in these areas. </p>

<p> A study by the Rotterdam Municipal Council shows that the
number of cocaine users there has risen substantially. About 3.3%
of all Rotterdam residents over 15 years of age or approximately
12,000 people now use cocaine. </p>

<p>Violent crime is also a major problem in the Netherlands. A
1992 study of crime victims in twenty (mostly European) countries
ranks the Netherlands as the number one country in Europe for
assaults and threats. </p>

<p>The Dutch Criminal Intelligence Service reported 104
gunrelated deaths in the Netherlands in 1992, compared to 73 in
1991. Almost all involved drug disputes. Robberies have also
increased in each of the four years since 1988. </p>

<p>The Netherlands, smaller than West Virginia, has more than 50
clinics supplying methadone to heroin addicts, and drug violators
make up a large percentage of prisoners in the Dutch prison
system. </p>

<p> Zurich authorities moved many addicts to a new site, a
nearby abandoned railway station, a few blocks north of Needle
Park. Here, addicts receive clean needles and are allowed to
inject heroin and consume other drugs. Writing in Drug Abuse
Update in 1994, Sue Rusche, executive director of National
Families in Action, gave this description of what passersby can
see if they look down from the Kornhaus Bridge: </p>

<p>&quot;Most people think shots are bloodless events. A nurse
inserts a needle, injects a medicine and you're on your way. But
here, bright red blood streams down arms, necks, legs, feet and
groins as addicts inject themselves. Festering red and purple
sores filled with pus, old blood and filthy scabs stretch from
wrist to elbow, ankle to knee.&quot; <br>

<h2>CLAIM VIII: DRUG CONTROL SPENDING IS A MINOR PORTION OF THE
U.S. BUDGET, AND COMPARED TO THE COSTS OF DRUG ABUSE, SPENDING IS
MINUSCULE. </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization advocates claim that this nation has spent
billions of dollars to control drug production, trafficking and
use with few, if any, positive results. They contend that the
money spent on drug control should be shifted to other, more
productive endeavors. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This whole claim is another curious argument. It seems that
the DEA is saying, &quot;We don't take very much money in the
bigger scheme of things, so leave us alone.&quot; From my own
perspective, I still regard several billion dollars as a lot of
money. </p>

<p>There is no doubt that a lot of money is spent on drug
enforcement and there is no doubt that even the DEA has never
claimed that it ever had any significant effect on reducing the
supply of drugs. If a program to spend several billion dollars is
as useless as this one, it behooves us to look for a better
approach. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The truth is, we have made great progress in reducing drug use
during the past 15 years. If the relatively modest outlays of
Federal dollars had not been made, drug abuse and attendant
social costs would have been far greater. The good news is that
drug use has declined significantly between 1979 and 1993. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Whether drug use has been significantly reduced is open to
question, particularly in view of the survey methods used to
arrive at such conclusions. </p>

<p>Even if we assumed that this statement is true, it would still
leave open the question of whether any other approach might have
produced better results. That is a question the DEA does not even
want to consider. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The experts participating in the Anti-Legalization forum
disputed the claim that money allegedly saved from giving up on
the drug problem could be better spent on education and social
problems. When compared to the amount of funding that is spent on
other national priorities, drug control spending is minimal.
There has been progress in reducing drug use, and the money spent
has been effective and worthwhile. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This argument is illogical. The participants state that the
money could not be better spent on education and social problems
because &quot;drug control spending is minimal.&quot; Whether the
spending is minimal (by their terms) has no bearing on whether
the spending is wise. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>On the surface, legalization proponents present an appealing,
simple argument that by legalizing drugs we can move vast sums of
money from drug law enforcement into solving society's ills. They
leave unanswered questions about the cost of collecting revenues
associated with drug sales, or the cost of regulating drugs. </p>

<p>They ignore questions concerning the purity, potency and
quality of legal drugs, the costs of insuring a safe product, and
costs associated with increased liability litigation. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>No revenue is collected from drug sales now, except by outlaw
drug dealers. Any collection of tax revenues would be an
improvement. </p>

<p>There are no standards for purity, potency, or quality now
except those established by outlaw drug dealers, and there is no
one to sue for an unsafe product. Any legal standards would be an
improvement in this area. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Ask proponents of legalization for specifics. Would the raw
material for these drugs be purchased from traditional sources,
or would the United States produce its own marijuana, coca and
opium? Would the government pay farmers subsidies to produce or
not produce these crops? Although all of these questions could be
resolved, none comes without a price tag. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The United States could easily produce all of its own
marijuana, as the DEA should know from the fact that it was
America's largest commercial crop before it was outlawed. </p>

<p>The Federal Government should not be in the position of paying
farmers subsidies to produce any dangerous, addictive drug,
including tobacco. The rules for subsidies should be consistent
across the board. </p>

<p>However difficult these questions may be to agree on, it still
does not present any evidence that throwing people in prison for
drugs is a good idea. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Proponents also conveniently fail to mention that unless drugs
are made available to little children, law enforcement will still
be needed to deal with the sale of drugs to minors. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is one of the phoniest arguments to come down the pike.
No one except the DEA has suggested that drugs should be
&quot;made available to little children&quot;. </p>

<p>We have laws now to prevent the sale of alcohol to minors and
the rules for other drugs should be no different. Law enforcement
is needed to deal with the sale of alcohol to minors but it is by
no means an overwhelming problem. </p>

<p>If the DEA was really concerned about little children, they
would recommend stronger action against convenience store clerks
who sell tobacco to children. An American is about 100 times as
likely to die from tobacco as from any illegal drug, and
childhood is when most of them become addicted. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>But more importantly, in their simplistic arguments, they omit
mention of the atrocious social costs that would be incurred with
a larger class of drug users. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>No, we freely admit that drugs are going to impose a
tremendous social cost whatever we do. That is still not a good
reason to undertake actions which are counterproductive, such as
prison. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization would also result in lost workforce productivity
and a resultant increase in the cost of goods. A new class of
unemployables would be created who were unfit to hire because of
their drug dependence. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>There is no evidence for this at all. The DEA proposes that
prison is the best way to keep drug users productive. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Health and societal costs of drug legalization would also
increase, the panel predicted. Drug treatment costs,
hospitalization for longterm drugrelated disease, and treatment
of family violence consequences would further burden our already
strapped healthcare system. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The panel came together for the purpose of fighting
&quot;legalization&quot; so it is no surprise that they would
predict it would be a disaster. It is important to note that they
did no research to back up their prediction and every major study
of drug policy in the last fifty years disagreed with them. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>There was also no guarantee, according to the group, that
criminal justice costs would decline if drugs were legalized. It
is possible that law enforcement would be additionally burdened
with addressing violations of traffic and family violence laws if
more people had access to drugs. Law enforcement is already
challenged by significant alcoholrelated crimes. More users mean
more crimes committed, and incarceration costs would increase. </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> In 1995, over $13 billion is being spent by the federal
government on drug control, including treatment, education, law
enforcement and international activities. </p>

<p> Drug abuse costs the United States between $60 and $100
billion in lost productivity each year. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Most of this cost is caused by alcohol, which the DEA does not
address at all. Even if all this cost was the result of illegal
drugs, there is still no evidence that throwing people in prison
is the best way to reduce those costs. Does the DEA honestly
propose that the best way to make sure that people are productive
is to throw them in prison? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> The Federal Government spends billions of dollars each year
on other national priorities. In Fiscal Year 1995, the Federal
Government is spending </p>

<p>$ 243.4 billion on Defense </p>

<p>$ 350 billion on Social Security </p>

<p>$ 61.6 billion on Agriculture </p>

<p>$ 22 billion on Welfare </p>

<p>$ 13.5 billion on Foreign Assistance </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>And? Not one word here is any kind of an argument in favor of
throwing people in prison for drugs. <br>

<h2>CLAIM IX: DRUG PROHIBITION IS WORKING </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization advocates claim that drug prohibition is akin to
alcohol prohibition earlier this century. Their main premise is
that it is impossible to prohibit people from using substances
that they want to use. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>It seems obvious that it is impossible, by the DEA's own
evidence. But there are other reasons as well. Even if it was
possible, we should not undertake actions which do more harm than
good. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Participants in the AntiLegalization forum felt that
legalization opponents should point to the successes of
Prohibition and to continuously stress the positive progress that
has been made between 1979 and 1994 in reducing levels of drug
abuse. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Does the DEA feel that the &quot;successes of
Prohibition&quot; were so great that we should bring back
Prohibition? Why not? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>When the Volstead Act was repealed, arrests for alcohol
traffickers disappeared, but arrests of alcohol related incidents
rose, indicating that the prohibition against alcohol had kept
people from using it. The same will happen if drugs are
legalized. Once drug use is sanctioned by the government, more
people will use drugs. </p>

<p>It is also important to remember that after Prohibition was
repealed, organized crime branched out into other areas, and
there is every expectation that current drug organizations would
also continue and diversify. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>After Prohibition was repealed, organized crime lost its
single biggest source of funding. This is the same argument the
DEA made before, that we must keep drug prohibition to keep the
drug dealers employed so they will not do something else. Again,
we have to asked what would happen if the DEA really did succeed
in stamping out drugs. Would we have to start selling them again
to keep the criminals from doing something else? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> Dr. Mark Moore, in a 1992 article titled &quot;Actually,
Prohibition Was a Success&quot; points out that alcohol
consumption declined during the Prohibition years by as much as
3050%. Mental hospital admissions from alcoholinduced psychosis
declined 50%. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The Wickersham Commission, which was formed to study and
improve Prohibition, found that alcohol use fell in the first
year of Prohibition and rose every year thereafter. </p>

<p>Assuming this was true, does that mean that the DEA is
advocating the return of alcohol Prohibition? Why not? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Robert Peterson, Director of the Michigan Office of Drug
Control Policy, states that &quot;Since the repeal of
Prohibition, alcohol consumption has tripled.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Does this mean that the DEA is advocating the return of
alcohol Prohibition? Why not? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Alcohol, unlike currently illegal drugs, has a long history
of social acceptance and has an important role in many cultures.
Alcohol can also be selfadministered in small doses with little
damaging effects. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA is saying that some drugs can be sold in the local
store, while others merit a term in prison if you possess them.
The difference, it seems, is based on their popularity. By this
argument, when these drugs reach a certain level of popularity
then it will be appropriate to sell them as we do alcohol and
tobacco. </p>

<p>Other drugs also have a long history of social acceptance
which the DEA would like to deny. Marijuana (hemp), for example,
was once this nation's largest crop and was even grown by our
founding fathers such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. </p>

<p>Most drugs can be self-administered in small doses with little
damaging effects and, in most examples of their use, they are. </p>

<p>Even if one believes the DEA's figures on this score (and

<h2>CLAIM X: DRUG LEGALIZATION WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON
LOWINCOME COMMUNITIES </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some proponents of legalization claim that current strict drug
control policies have a disproportionately adverse effect on poor
communities. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This much is obvious from even the most cursory examination of
the statistics. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The drug laws of the United States, and efforts to stop drug
trafficking and abuse, are designed to protect all people from
the harm and denigration that illegal drugs cause. If one
economic group or another is disproportionately affected by the
implementation of current laws, that problem should be dealt with
in its proper context--not by legalizing drugs. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the laws were based largely on racism and
the fears of such things as Chinese men luring white women to
their ruin in opium dens, and the mythical &quot;Negro Cocaine
Fiend.&quot; Harry Anslinger specifically stated that the primary
reason to outlaw marijuana (hemp) was &quot;its effect on the
degenerate races.&quot; </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The participants at the Forum, many of them city police
chiefs, disagreed with the notion that legalization would improve
the lot of the poor. </p>

<p>Legalization proponents argue that fewer people would be
arrested for drug trafficking crime and the violence associated
with turf protection would be reduced if drugs were legalized.
That argument assumes that drugrelated violence is limited to
rival drug gangs disputing turf, when in fact, most drug violence
is committed by people under the influence of drugs. </p>

<p>The incidence of dysfunctional families, unemployability,
family violence, and ruined lives would increase in lowincome
communities, just as they would in every other community. All
communities would see increased aberrant behavior because of
increased drug use; increased occurrences of child neglect;
increased family disintegration; increased fetal damage caused by
mothers' drug use; increased social welfare costs; loss of
workforce productivity; increased auto accidents because drivers
are driving under the influence of drugs; increased industrial
accidents caused by impaired workers; increased absenteeism; and
increases in emergency room visits and overdose deaths. In short,
all Americans would see a moral decline of society. </p>

<p>Drug use in the inner city is a manifestation of other
problems in the inner city; these problems would not go away if
more drugs were available. If proponents truly believe that
legalization would have a positive affect on communities, we
challenge them to set up a trial program in their own community. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is an empty challenge. If anyone tried it, the DEA would
have them in jail before the first results could be evaluated.
This kind of trial program is the last thing the DEA wants to
see, as they have already stated by their opposition to an
objective Federal Commission to examine the evidence. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> In his 1994 article in the New England Journal of Medicine,
Dr. Herbert Kleber addresses the drug situation: &quot;Our
current drug situation follows a pattern of earlier drug
epidemics. As the use of drugs drops from epidemic to endemic
levels, disadvantaged groups are more likely than others to
continue using drugs because of their greater availability and
fewer alternative opportunities. That is why minority communities
want not only treatment facilities but also fair laws, justly
applied to reduce the horrendous toll of drug related crime in
their neighborhoods. The illegal, open air drug bazaars that
flourish in southeastern Washington DC and the South Bronx would
not be tolerated in Georgetown or Scarsdale.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Try as I might, I can't find anything in that statement which
says that throwing massive numbers of people in prison for drug
offenses is a good idea. <br>

<h2>CLAIM III: LEGALIZATION OF DRUGS WILL LEAD TO INCREASED USE
AND INCREASED ADDICTION LEVELS </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>A cornerstone of the legalization proponents' position is the
claim that making illegal drugs legal would not cause more of
these substances to be consumed, nor would addiction increase.
They claim that many people can use drugs in moderation and that
many would choose not to use drugs, just as many forego alcohol
and tobacco now. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Every major study of drug policy agreed that there is no
evidence that drug use would increase with more sensible
policies. In fact, they found that drug use would probably
decrease with more sensible policies. </p>

<p>They also found that, even if drug use did increase,
decriminalization would still be a better approach simply because
of all the harm caused by the current policy. See the list of the
Biggest Studies of Drug Policy, also on these web pages. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Participants in the AntiLegalization Forum felt strongly that
when drugs are more widely available--as they certainly would be
if they were legalized--rates of use and addiction would
increase. </p>

<p>Legalizing drugs sends a message that drug use (like tobacco
and alcohol) is acceptable, and encourages drug use among people
who currently do not use drugs. </p>

<p>When the social taboos about premarital sex were removed, the
nation's illegitimate birthrate soared. And we are paying dearly
for it. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>All of the arguments here depend upon what you mean by
&quot;legalized&quot;. </p>

<p>No, it does not send any such message, and our society's
campaigns against tobacco are perhaps the best example. And of
course, the real question is: How many millions of people do we
have to put in prison to show the right amount of disapproval? </p>

<p>This is a &quot;TV-talk-show&quot; argument, which blithely
ignores the fact that the illegitimate birth rate is due to
problems much more complex than the taboo on premarital sex. </p>

<p>Does this mean that, as a solution, the DEA is proposing that
we throw people in prison for premarital sex? There are lots of
ways to discourage something without throwing people in prison. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Look to our history. For years, the United States legally
refined morphine from opium, and hailed it as a miracle drug.
Many soldiers on both sides of the Civil War who were given
morphine for their wounds became addicted to it. Are we ready for
more morphine addicts? Crack addicts? Heroin addicts? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Morphine was first refined when many battle wounds were
treated with simple amputation without anesthesia and a doctor
was considered a good surgeon if he could do the amputation
quickly to minimize the pain. In the medical context of that type
of &quot;surgery&quot; and the fact that there were no
antibiotics to control infections, morphine was a real miracle
drug because it relieved a great deal of suffering. </p>

<p>The figures differ on the number of Civil War veterans who
became addicts, partly because of the difficulty in defining what
an addict is. There was widespread use of these drugs simply
because there were no regulations at all during this period and
they were included in many common patent medicines, including
remedies for baby colic. There is no evidence that the Civil War
veterans who became addicts were any more of a problem to society
than a modern tobacco addict. The 1905 Pure Food and Drug Act was
the first law to require manufacturers to state the contents of
their mixtures on the label. This was clearly a good law because
it helped consumers make an informed decision. Drug use declined
steadily between the time the law was passed and 1914, when the
Harrison Narcotics Act was passed. See any of the major studies
listed elsewhere in this book for a more complete history of the
subject. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Early in the 20th Century, drugs were plentiful, cheap, and
legal in the United States. Some could even be bought from the
Sears Catalogue. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is true. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>But Americans realized that these legalized drugs were harmful
to individuals and society, and drug laws were written. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is not true. The reasons were more complex than this and
were largely based on racism and ignorance. No evidence was
presented to Congress to show that prohibition was either
necessary or desirable. No evidence was even presented to show
that these drugs were even medically harmful. In the case of
cocaine and the opiates, it is doubtful if Congress realized it
was passing what would be regarded as a general prohibition on
these drugs because it was phrased as a tax act. In the case of
marijuana (hemp) it is clear that most members of Congress did
not realize that they were passing a law to prohibit the most
common crop in America. These laws were a hoax from the very
begining. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>CocaCola took the coca out of its popular soft drink and
substituted caffeine. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is true. The original name of Coca-Cola was &quot;French
Wine of Coca -- Invigorating Tonic&quot;. It is also true that
there was a campaign to outlaw caffeine for the same reasons that
cocaine was outlawed. That campaign died when it was realized
that caffeine was contained in too many common foods, such as
coffee, tea, and chocolate. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization proponents would have them put it back, and make
opium as available as chewing gum. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is a flat-out lie and a cheap, deliberate attempt to
distort the arguments. It shows that the DEA has set up
&quot;legalization&quot; as a straw man, defined in their own
extreme terms. We do not agree with this extreme policy, or the
DEA's extreme definition of &quot;legalization&quot;. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>More recently Alaska decriminalized the personal use of small
amounts of marijuana in the home. The experiment did not turn out
the way legalization proponents had predicted. Although the legal
age for using marijuana was 19, adolescents as young as 12 years
old were using the drug. Alaskans eventually came to the
realization that decriminalization did not work, and voted to
overturn the law. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Twelve-year-olds using marijuana (hemp) is nothing new. I
observed pre-teens using marijuana (hemp) more than twenty-five
years ago, and it appeared to me that it was fairly common among
children of that age. Decriminalization in any area has never
been shown to have any real effect on the use patterns of
marijuana. </p>

<p>The law was overturned because of a massive campaign headed by
then-Drug-Czar William Bennett as one of the cornerstones of his
campaigns against the evils of drugs. Bennett, at the time, was a
tobacco addict. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The experts believe that legalization of drugs would decrease
the perception of risk currently associated with drug use. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Let's assume that the DEA experts are right. How many millions
of people do we have to put in prison to create the proper
perception of risk? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The group strongly endorsed the notion that the Government
should help protect people from substances and activities that
are harmful to themselves the community and society at large. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>So why aren't we throwing people in prison for alcohol or
tobacco? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> Dr. Herbert Kleber, prominent psychiatrist from Yale
University, former Demand Reduction Deputy Director at the Office
of National Drug Control Policy and currently with the Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, states in a
1994 article in the New England Journal of Medicine that clinical
data support the premise that drug use would increase with
legalization. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Dr. Kleber does not define what he means by
&quot;legalization.&quot; There are any number of different
policies which could be defined as &quot;legalization,&quot; each
of which could have widely varying effects. Therefore, all the
rest of his statements on the subject are essentially
meaningless. Even if he did define what he means by
&quot;legalization&quot;, it is not the only option we have for
drug policy. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>He says: &quot;There are over 50 million nicotine addicts, 18
million alcoholics or problem drinkers, and fewer than 2 million
cocaine addicts in the United States. Cocaine is a much more
addictive drug than alcohol. If cocaine were legally available,
as alcohol and nicotine are now, the number of cocaine abusers
would probably rise to a point somewhere between the number of
users of the other two agents, perhaps 20 to 25 million...the
number of compulsive users might be nine times higher...than the
current number. When drugs have been widely available--as...
cocaine was at the turn of the century--both use and addiction
have risen &quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>See the table below for the latest ratings on the relative
addictive qualities of drugs. </p>

<p>Dr. Kleber does not suggest that the most productive approach
to the 50 million nicotine addicts, or the 18 million alcoholics,
is to put alcohol or tobacco users in prison. Why not? </p>

<p>Drug use was widespread at the turn of the century. This
statement ignores the fact that drug use and addiction fell
steadily after manufacturers were required to list the
ingredients in their products. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> England's experience with widely available heroin shows
that use and addiction increase. Great Britain allowed doctors to
prescribe heroin to addicts. There was an explosion of heroin use
and by the mid-1980s known addiction rates were increasing by
about 30% a year. According to the Lancet, the wellrespected
medical journal (Lancet, January 9, 1982), 2,657 heroin addicts
were registered in 1970 compared with 5,107 in 1980. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>By the mid-1980's Great Britain was fully into the American
style drug war so it is apparent that, if there is any connection
between the drug war and addiction, the drug war must have made
the problem worse. </p>

<p>It is also worthwhile to note that the figures show that the
number of heroin addicts doubled in ten years, but the numbers
were still trivial in comparison to the number of addicts in any
comparable segment of the United States. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>This was a program in which heroin users needed a doctor's
authorization to get their drug. What would happen if anyone
wanting to try heroin could simply buy it at the government
store? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The vast majority of them would throw up after using it and
find they really didn't like the effects. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Alaska tried the legalization experiment and abandoned it.
Legalization was given a lengthy try closer to home when the
Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 1975 that the state could not
interfere with a person's possession of marijuana in his home for
personal use. Enforcement was permitted only when the quantity
possessed exceeded four ounces--this in a state that, because of
the long, sunny days of its brief growing season, produces extra
potent marijuana. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Alaska's ruling applied to personal possession of hemp
(marijuana) and use within the confines of one's own home. This
is a far cry from the &quot;legalization&quot; the DEA talks
about elsewhere. The court decided that the right of privacy
protected the citizen's rights within their own home. </p>

<p>All states are capable of producing extra potent marijuana.
Alaska is nothing special in this regard. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The court's ruling was interpreted by many Alaskans as a
signal to light up, and so they did, especially the young ones,
even though the ruling was limited to persons 19 and over.
According to a 1988 University of Alaska study, the state's 12 to
17yearolds used marijuana at more than twice the national average
for their age group. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>It is ludicrous to state that an Alaskan Supreme Court
decision would be interpreted by anyone as a &quot;signal to
light up.&quot; It is highly doubtful if teenagers govern their
behavior based on Supreme Court decisions. Anyone who wants to
use a drug is going to do so regardless of what the Supreme Court
may have said about it. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>&quot;The frequency with which marijuana was used within the
current sample,&quot; the report on the study said,
&quot;suggests that it is not an experimental event for many
students, but that it seems to have become well incorporated into
the lifestyle of many adolescents.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>And the DEA suggests that the best way to improve these
students lives is to hunt them down and put them in jail to cure
them of their lifestyle. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Although they historically cling to their personal liberties,
Alaska residents voted in 1990 to recriminalize possession of
marijuana, demonstrating their belief that increased use was too
high a price to pay for increased personal liberties. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>A referendum was passed in 1990 by Alaska voters which
attempted to overturn the Alaska Supreme Court decision. The
referendum was the result of an intensive, well-funded campaign
by then-Drug Czar William Bennett and other drug wars to remove a
major embarrassment to their cause -- the fact that Alaska had
protected private use of marijuana and Alaskan society had not
fallen apart as a result. The courts later threw out the vote
because the issue had been decided on a matter of basic
constitutional protections of privacy, which cannot be voted away
under Alaskan law. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Will the public support an aggressive marketing approach?
While &quot;government drugs&quot; could conceivably be priced
low enough, perhaps by having taxpayers subsidize them to
discourage a black market, the combination of low price and ready
availability would bring more consumption, more addiction. We
would have won the battle and lost the war. If they see this as
the probable outcome, the American people can hardly be expected
to endorse a &quot;sell at all costs&quot; policy. </p>

<p>Why should there be an aggressive marketing approach? </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Robert L. DuPont, M.D., former director of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, considered the impact legalization would
have on use and addiction rates in a paper published in 1994. </p>

<p>&quot;Would legalization increase the number of drug users and
the social harm produced by the use of drugs?&quot; Dr. DuPont
asked. &quot;The answer to those two questions is simply, 'Yes,
it would.&quot;' </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The answer to this question is simply: What
&quot;legalization&quot; are you talking about? Until you define
what you mean by &quot;legalization&quot; you can't define what
the likely effect on the number of drug users and social harm. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The current global experience with alcohol and tobacco reveals
the downside of legalization clearly, Dr. DuPont said. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is certainly true, keeping in mind the fact these drugs
are only legal under certain conditions. Despite this, Dr. DuPont
is not suggesting that we outlaw alcohol and tobacco as the most
appropriate response. Why not? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>&quot;Legalization of any drugs leads to large increases in
the use of the legalized drugs,&quot; he said. &quot;Because most
of the social costs of drugs are not the costs of prohibition but
the costs created by the drug use itself (a point proved beyond
dispute by the dismal global experience with alcohol and
tobacco), legalization raises the net social costs of drug use. </p>

<p><a name="DDE_LINK12"><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif"
align="bottom" width="562" height="19"></a><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Even if we assumed this to be true, every major study of drug
policy has said that the cost of the current policy far outweighs
the other potential costs. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>&quot;Legalization is an old, siren call which promises to
reduce the high costs of drug use, but which abundant evidence
shows would inevitably raise the costs society pays for drug use,
not reduce them. We do not need new experiments to make <br>

<h1>How to Approach the Black Community </h1>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p> There have been many people who have rightly criticized the
fact that the drug policy reform movement has not made major
allies in the black community - despite the fact that the black
community is clearly the most severely impacted by the drug war.
Instead, the reaction in the black community is often one of even
greater calls for law enforcement presence and even greater
support for the drug war. </p>

<p> While this is largely true, it is simply a matter that most
black people (like most white people) don't realize how we got to
where we are today with the drug problem. As soon as it is
explained in terms that are relevant and understandable to them,
they readily understand and agree with the need for reform -
specifically, not putting nearly so many people in prison. </p>

<p> I have always found it relatively easy to get black people,
particularly black leaders, to support drug policy reform. They
will not support &quot;legalization&quot;, but they will support
specific steps of reform which both they and the
&quot;legalizers&quot; agree are necessary. They already have a
problem with too many liquor stores in their communities, so they
will not support ideas which look like you are going to open up a
legal chain of crack houses. They can be expected to argue for
the point that we simply need to stop and look at what we are
doing, and seriously question the whole program. They will also
support and argue for constructive, rather than destructive
approaches to the problem. </p>

<p> Ultimately, many black leaders will tell you privately that
they support &quot;legalization&quot;, if they are just given the
facts as a basis for their view. However, they will still have a
significant problem with the public presentation. One church
leader told us that his church had once issued a health kit which
included various first aid items, educational materials, phone
numbers to call, a lot of other things, and a condom. He said
there was a storm of controversy about nothing but the condom and
they eventually had to take it out of the package because they
were spending all their time explaining it and defending it to
people, so they couldn't get anything else done. They ultimately
figured that it would be better to distribute the same package
with everything but the condom. It is sad, but it is a functional
reality of the community they live in. It is one task to persuade
them of the need for reform. It is another task to help them find
ways that they can address the issue with their own community. </p>

<h2>How to Find Them, Approach Them, and Win Them Over </h2>

<ol>
    <li>Do your homework. Be up to date on the latest stats,
        issues, and arguments as they relate to the black
        community. </li>
    <li>Look in the phone book for any churches or other social
        organizations located in, or allied to, the black
        community. </li>
    <li>Call the head of the organization and arrange an
        appointment. Most of them, particularly churches, will
        give you one if you just ask. </li>
    <li>Be prepared with charts, graphs, statistics, historical
        information, and reference sources, so you have an
        interesting and persuasive presentation. </li>
    <li>Cover the racial origins of the laws, with appropriate
        citations and quotes. </li>
    <li>Cover the current situation with black men, <u>including
        the lifetime risk of prison for black men</u> - and how
        the probability of a drug conviction relates to that
        total risk. </li>
    <li>Don't expect them to trust white people. After the last
        200 years, they are justified in being a little
        suspicious at times. Ask them to trust themselves and
        check everything you say. Then give them the reference
        sources to do it. </li>
    <li>Don't use the &quot;L&quot; word, the &quot;D&quot; word,
        or the &quot;M&quot; word. Use the &quot;R&quot; word -
        Reform - in terms that are specific to the concerns of
        the black community. Talk about constructive (treatment
        and education) rather than destructive (prison)
        approaches to the drug problem. </li>
    <li>They know that you (like most of those goody-good white
        people who come down to meddle in their community) are
        going to be gone tomorrow and not living with the
        consequences of whatever takes place in their community.
        Your arguments must, at all times, be expressed in terms
        which are meaningful and relevant to them. </li>
    <li>Understand their position. They CANNOT be seen as
        promoting or condoning drug use in any way at all. If you
        tell them you support the right of everyone to get
        loaded, you will find yourself in the parking lot in a
        matter of seconds. </li>
    <li>Remember that the Christian belief is very strong in the
        black community (though they do tend to have a somewhat
        more vigorous approach to their religion than those
        stuffy white people). The argument about what Jesus would
        do - build bigger prisons, or build hospitals and schools
        - will strike a resonant chord with many of them.
        Contrast love, compassion, and healing, with punishment,
        prison, and destruction. </li>
    <li>Help them to find a way to talk about it publicly. The
        issue of the disparity in the sentencing, and the sheer
        numbers of black men going to prison alone means that we
        should <b>AT LEAST </b>back up and take an honest look at
        what we are doing in the drug war. We must build, not
        destroy. And we must examine the entire drug war, not
        just the crack laws. </li>
    <li>Get them involved in our alliance. Get them connected to
        the Internet, if possible, (usually not possible), or get
        them on the mailing lists of the relevant organizations.
        Find someone from their group who will take the
        initiative in maintaining and responding to
        communications. </li>
    <li>Tell them about the online library and the fact that it
        has large amounts of information about the racial roots
        of the drug war, as well as other information. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Questions </h2>

<p> I have listed below, a number of the common questions which
will come up in such an interview, whether they are explicitly
stated or not. </p>

<h3>What is their biggest concern? </h3>

<p> Their biggest single concern at this point is the ongoing
massive destruction of black men. Black men are being rendered
&quot;economically dead&quot; by the massive imposition of prison
sentences. Their point of view may be somewhat skewed, in that
they may view this as a result of the drugs, not the laws, and it
may not have occurred to them that, as bad as drugs are, criminal
punishment is not the way to address the problem. </p>

<h3>Why did this white boy come all the way over here to tell
this to me? </h3>

<p> Because I am concerned about the drug war for my own reasons,
and I have the good sense to recognize that there are other
people who would also have concerns, for their own reasons. We
will both achieve better results if we work together toward
common goals. And, just as a matter of common sense and common
decency, I think it is pretty stupid to lock up half of all the
black men in America. There has to be a better way. </p>

<h3>Why should I trust you? </h3>

<p> Don't trust me. Trust yourself. I will simply give you a
point of view and the evidence which I think firmly supports it.
I think the evidence will shock you, but I don't ask you to
believe it. I will give you the reference sources where I got it,
and I encourage you to do your own research and let me know of
any facts or issues that I have missed. My strongest allies have
always come from the people who went to the library and verified
what I said. </p>

<h3>Why should black people support drug policy reform? </h3>

<ol>
    <li>Because the drug problem is tearing up the black
        community and we need to find a better approach -
        whatever it may be. </li>
    <li>Because the drug laws were based on racism from their
        inception, so there is no reason to expect them to be
        balanced and productive laws today. </li>
    <li>Because every major study of drug policy said that this
        policy only caused more harm than good, particularly for
        poor communities. </li>
    <li>Because it is what Jesus would do. </li>
    <li>Because we want to rebuild black men and make them
        productive citizens, not destroy them. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Are you asking me to support legalization? </h3>

<p> Not at all. I am asking you to recognize the simple
proposition that prison has become a bigger threat to black men
than the drugs themselves. Black men can, and do, recover from
drug problems and go on to live productive lives. They have a
much harder time recovering from a long stretch in prison. We
need to discourage drug use but we do not need to destroy their
lives in order to save them. </p>

<h3>But some of these guys are dangerous and need to be locked
up! </h3>

<p> I fully admit that there are a good number of black men out
there who are dangerous and should be locked up for the good of
society. But we have now reached the point where about half of
all the young black men in America will have spent at least one
stretch in prison before they are thirty. I find it hard to
believe that we have to lock up half of all the young black men
in America for the good of society. Whenever the numbers get that
large, we must stop and ask ourselves if this is really the best
course of action. </p>

<h3>Don't we need some jails? </h3>

<p> Certainly we do. But we learned long ago that, as bad as
alcohol is, Prohibition only caused more problems than it solved.
In the current situation, we can use our money to put one more
black man in prison, or we can use the same amount of money to
provide education or treatment to more than one hundred black
men. Suppose that someone gave us the decision on where we should
spend the next million dollars of tax money on this problem -
what should we do? Should we provide education and treatment for
up to two hundred people, or should we put two more drug dealers
in jail? </p>

<h3>How can I speak about this publicly? </h3>

<ol>
    <li>Talk about the terrible damage being done by not only the
        crack laws, but the drug laws in general. The crack laws
        are the worst example, but they are only one small part
        of a bigger system that is severely impacting black men. </li>
    <li>Talk about the need for education and treatment, not
        prison. Talk about the need for responses to the problem
        which build people rather than destroy them. </li>
    <li>Talk about the racial roots of the drug laws - how these
        laws were built on racism from their very inception, and
        how the image of the Negro Cocaine Fiend in 1914 is
        repeated in the image of the crack-fiend today. </li>
    <li>Talk about the need for an open and honest investigation
        of this entire drug problem - not just the mandatory
        minimums for crack. It is the entire drug policy which is
        wrong and it is the entire drug policy which must be
        fairly, openly, and honestly investigated. </li>
</ol>

<h2>CLAIM VIII: DRUG CONTROL SPENDING IS A MINOR PORTION OF THE
U.S. BUDGET, AND COMPARED TO THE COSTS OF DRUG ABUSE, SPENDING IS
MINUSCULE. </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization advocates claim that this nation has spent
billions of dollars to control drug production, trafficking and
use with few, if any, positive results. They contend that the
money spent on drug control should be shifted to other, more
productive endeavors. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This whole claim is another curious argument. It seems that
the DEA is saying, &quot;We don't take very much money in the
bigger scheme of things, so leave us alone.&quot; From my own
perspective, I still regard several billion dollars as a lot of
money. </p>

<p>There is no doubt that a lot of money is spent on drug
enforcement and there is no doubt that even the DEA has never
claimed that it ever had any significant effect on reducing the
supply of drugs. If a program to spend several billion dollars is
as useless as this one, it behooves us to look for a better
approach. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The truth is, we have made great progress in reducing drug use
during the past 15 years. If the relatively modest outlays of
Federal dollars had not been made, drug abuse and attendant
social costs would have been far greater. The good news is that
drug use has declined significantly between 1979 and 1993. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Whether drug use has been significantly reduced is open to
question, particularly in view of the survey methods used to
arrive at such conclusions. </p>

<p>Even if we assumed that this statement is true, it would still
leave open the question of whether any other approach might have
produced better results. That is a question the DEA does not even
want to consider. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The experts participating in the Anti-Legalization forum
disputed the claim that money allegedly saved from giving up on
the drug problem could be better spent on education and social
problems. When compared to the amount of funding that is spent on
other national priorities, drug control spending is minimal.
There has been progress in reducing drug use, and the money spent
has been effective and worthwhile. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This argument is illogical. The participants state that the
money could not be better spent on education and social problems
because &quot;drug control spending is minimal.&quot; Whether the
spending is minimal (by their terms) has no bearing on whether
the spending is wise. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>On the surface, legalization proponents present an appealing,
simple argument that by legalizing drugs we can move vast sums of
money from drug law enforcement into solving society's ills. They
leave unanswered questions about the cost of collecting revenues
associated with drug sales, or the cost of regulating drugs. </p>

<p>They ignore questions concerning the purity, potency and
quality of legal drugs, the costs of insuring a safe product, and
costs associated with increased liability litigation. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>No revenue is collected from drug sales now, except by outlaw
drug dealers. Any collection of tax revenues would be an
improvement. </p>

<p>There are no standards for purity, potency, or quality now
except those established by outlaw drug dealers, and there is no
one to sue for an unsafe product. Any legal standards would be an
improvement in this area. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Ask proponents of legalization for specifics. Would the raw
material for these drugs be purchased from traditional sources,
or would the United States produce its own marijuana, coca and
opium? Would the government pay farmers subsidies to produce or
not produce these crops? Although all of these questions could be
resolved, none comes without a price tag. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The United States could easily produce all of its own
marijuana, as the DEA should know from the fact that it was
America's largest commercial crop before it was outlawed. </p>

<p>The Federal Government should not be in the position of paying
farmers subsidies to produce any dangerous, addictive drug,
including tobacco. The rules for subsidies should be consistent
across the board. </p>

<p>However difficult these questions may be to agree on, it still
does not present any evidence that throwing people in prison for
drugs is a good idea. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Proponents also conveniently fail to mention that unless drugs
are made available to little children, law enforcement will still
be needed to deal with the sale of drugs to minors. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is one of the phoniest arguments to come down the pike.
No one except the DEA has suggested that drugs should be
&quot;made available to little children&quot;. </p>

<p>We have laws now to prevent the sale of alcohol to minors and
the rules for other drugs should be no different. Law enforcement
is needed to deal with the sale of alcohol to minors but it is by
no means an overwhelming problem. </p>

<p>If the DEA was really concerned about little children, they
would recommend stronger action against convenience store clerks
who sell tobacco to children. An American is about 100 times as
likely to die from tobacco as from any illegal drug, and
childhood is when most of them become addicted. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>But more importantly, in their simplistic arguments, they omit
mention of the atrocious social costs that would be incurred with
a larger class of drug users. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>No, we freely admit that drugs are going to impose a
tremendous social cost whatever we do. That is still not a good
reason to undertake actions which are counterproductive, such as
prison. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization would also result in lost workforce productivity
and a resultant increase in the cost of goods. A new class of
unemployables would be created who were unfit to hire because of
their drug dependence. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>There is no evidence for this at all. The DEA proposes that
prison is the best way to keep drug users productive. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Health and societal costs of drug legalization would also
increase, the panel predicted. Drug treatment costs,
hospitalization for longterm drugrelated disease, and treatment
of family violence consequences would further burden our already
strapped healthcare system. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The panel came together for the purpose of fighting
&quot;legalization&quot; so it is no surprise that they would
predict it would be a disaster. It is important to note that they
did no research to back up their prediction and every major study
of drug policy in the last fifty years disagreed with them. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>There was also no guarantee, according to the group, that
criminal justice costs would decline if drugs were legalized. It
is possible that law enforcement would be additionally burdened
with addressing violations of traffic and family violence laws if
more people had access to drugs. Law enforcement is already
challenged by significant alcoholrelated crimes. More users mean
more crimes committed, and incarceration costs would increase. </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> In 1995, over $13 billion is being spent by the federal
government on drug control, including treatment, education, law
enforcement and international activities. </p>

<p> Drug abuse costs the United States between $60 and $100
billion in lost productivity each year. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Most of this cost is caused by alcohol, which the DEA does not
address at all. Even if all this cost was the result of illegal
drugs, there is still no evidence that throwing people in prison
is the best way to reduce those costs. Does the DEA honestly
propose that the best way to make sure that people are productive
is to throw them in prison? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> The Federal Government spends billions of dollars each year
on other national priorities. In Fiscal Year 1995, the Federal
Government is spending </p>

<p>$ 243.4 billion on Defense </p>

<p>$ 350 billion on Social Security </p>

<p>$ 61.6 billion on Agriculture </p>

<p>$ 22 billion on Welfare </p>

<p>$ 13.5 billion on Foreign Assistance </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>And? Not one word here is any kind of an argument in favor of
throwing people in prison for drugs. <br>

<h1>How to Write Letters to the Editor</h1>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> <br>
</h2>

<p> A personal note by Cliff Schaffer: </p>

<p> Over the years, I have written a lot of letters to the editor
and about three out of four of them get published. A lot of
people have asked me what are the good techniques for writing
letters to the editor. The first thing I tell people is to
remember that they fit about ten letters in a typical editorial
section (out of the hundreds they receive) so the ones they
publish either: </p>

<p> 1) Are the best single expressions of what many people said. </p>

<p> 2) Make some point exceedingly well. </p>

<p> 3) Are signed by some prominent person. </p>

<p> In all cases, the letters are usually short and to the point,
and the editors have edited them even further to make them
shorter. Most people who write letters to the editor would
probably like the satisfaction you get when you see your letter
published. That way, at least you are certain that they read it.
However, it is also apparent that the media can be influenced by
letters they do not acknowledge. We have found many times that a
simple letter to someone in the media wound up in major media
coverage weeks or months later. </p>

<p> I was going to write up a formal set of rules for how to
write letters to the editor, but I found someone who had done it
already. He did quite a good job in saying the same essential
things I would have said. </p>

<p> =================================== </p>

<p> How to Write Letters to the Editor by Richard Rider </p>

<p> Short, concise letters are always more likely to be published
than long, meandering ones; try to keep them under 150 words. The
longer letters are also more likely to be edited. It's better
that you do your own editing. </p>

<p> Ever notice how you read letters to the editor in the paper?
Most people read the shorter letters first and then perhaps later
read the longer ones. Thus your shorter letter has a better
chance of being read. </p>

<p> WHAT TO WRITE? Unlike single-issue or special-interest
groups, libertarians can select from an enormous range of
subjects. Replying to editorials, agree or disagree, is very
effective. </p>

<p> Every day the news offers us all too many topics on which to
comment. </p>

<p> Be timely; try to respond within two or three days of the
article's publication. Pick an issue of particular importance to
you - don't be afraid to let some passion show through. </p>

<p> Here are some stylistic considerations: </p>

<p> 1. State the argument you're rebutting or responding to, as
briefly as possible, in the letter's introduction. Don't do a
lengthy rehash; it's a waste of valuable space and boring to
boot. </p>

<p> 2. Stick to a single subject. Deal with one issue per letter.
</p>

<p> 3. Don't be shrill or abusive. Editors tend to discard
letters containing personal attacks. Even though you're dying to
call Jesse Jackson a preachy parasite, stifle the urge. </p>

<p> 4. Your letter should be logically organized. First a brief
recitation of the argument you are opposing, followed by a
statement of your own position. Then present your evidence. Close
with a short restatement of your position or a pithy comment </p>

<p> (&quot;Jimmy Breslin says possession of firearms should be
limited to law enforcement officers. I say when only the police
have guns, the police state is just around the corner.&quot;). </p>

<p> 5. Use facts, figures and expert testimony whenever possible.
This raises your letters above the &quot;sez you, sez me&quot;
category. For instance: &quot;Anthony Lewis calls for taxing the
rich as a way to balance the budget. Is he aware of the fact that
if we confiscated the entire income of the top wage earners in
this country (those with income above $200,000), this would run
the federal government for exactly 8 days?&quot; </p>

<p> Readers respect the opinions of people with special knowledge
or expertise. Use expert testimony to bolster your case
(&quot;George Will claims we need to draft to defend America. But
General Edward C. Meyer, Army Chief of Staff, recently stated . .
.&quot;). </p>

<p> 6. Proofread your letter carefully for errors in spelling,
punctuation and grammar. Newspapers will usually edit to correct
these mistakes, but your piece is more likely to be published if
it is &quot;clean&quot; to begin with. Read your letter to a
friend, for objective input. </p>

<p> One suggestion is that a letter shouldn't be mailed the same
day it is written. Write, proofread and edit the piece. Then put
it aside until the next day. Rereading your letter in a fresh
light often helps you to spot errors in reasoning, stilted
language and the like. On the other hand, don't let the letter
sit too long and lose it's timeliness. </p>

<p> 7. Try to view the letter from the reader's perspective. Will
the arguments make sense to someone without a special background
on this issue. Did you use technical terms not familiar to the
average reader? </p>

<ol>
    <li>Should your letter be typed? In this day and age,
        generally yes. Double or triple space the letter if it is
        short. For faxing purposes, we appreciate it if the
        letter is all on one page, so single spacing might be the
        only option available. </li>
    <li>Direct your missives to &quot;Letters to the
        Editor,&quot; or some similar sounding title. </li>
</ol>

<p> 10. Always include your name, address, day-time phone number
and signature. The papers will not publish this information, but
they may use it to verify that you wrote the letter. If we are
fax broadcasting your letter, do not put a date on it. We may
have to wait a day or two before broadcasting it out, depending
on how many letters are waiting for dissemination. </p>

<p> 11. Most important - WRITE! Do not try to do a perfect
letter. Just give it a good effort and send it off. Letter
writing is the one thing that any one of us can do on our own
without the need to work through a group. No committees are
necessary. Just do it! </p>

<p> Don't be discouraged if your letter isn't published. The
editor may have received more responses on that issue than he
feels he can handle. </p>

<p> If we are faxing your letter, you will almost certainly be
published somewhere. The only drawback is that we do not have a
good feedback system, so you may not know which of the papers
publish your letter, particularly the smaller ones. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<h2>CLAIM II: WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN REDUCING DRUG
USE IN THIS COUNTRY. NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO ABANDON OUR EFFORTS. </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>No one has suggested that we should &quot;abandon&quot; our
efforts to reduce the problems associated with drugs. What we
have suggested is that we should make those efforts more
cost-effective. Prison is not cost effective. </p>

<p>Even if we accepted this claim as true, there is no evidence
that the progress in reducing drug use was at all due to the
number of people put in prison. In fact, the evidence clearly
shows that the number of people put in prison could not have had
enough of an impact on the average white, middle-class drug user
to make any difference at all in drug use. If there was any
actual reduction in drug use (and not just in
&quot;reported&quot; drug use) then it seems clear that it must
have been due to other factors. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization advocates claim that the fight against drugs has
not been won, and is, in fact, unwinnable. They frequently state
that people still take drugs, drugs are widely available, and
that the changing that fact is a lost cause. Legalization is the
alternative. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>It should be clear to anyone that the war on drugs has not
been won. There is no credible evidence anywhere which would
suggest that the war could be won by the current methods, and the
DEA has presented no such evidence here. The alternative is to
look for a better approach, whatever we might choose to call it. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The conference participants disagreed with the notion that we
should wave the white flag of surrender because people still take
drugs. The experts contended that there have been many positive
developments over the past fifteen years in reducing drug use,
and stated that the good news is often given short shrift. Our
drug problem did not happen overnight, and it will take a number
of years to eliminate the problem. Legalization is not an
alternative to combating the drug problem. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>As happened with Vietnam, there comes a point when must
recognize that we never should have taken this course in the
first place. It is not surrender to end the war on drugs, it is a
recognition of what we should have recognized years ago. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The United States faces a number of problems today which, like
our drug problem, are not susceptible to easy solutions,
including illegal immigration, declining education quality and
public health problems. Should we just post signs on our borders
that we've given up and invite a tide of immigrants in? Should we
declare that our education system has been a failure and give
children a permanent vacation from school? Should we throw up our
hands in frustration about AIDS and stop searching for a cure? Of
course not. Americans are a people committed to solving problems,
not running from them. Why should our commitment to stopping
drugs be any different from our approach to other national
interests? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>There is no doubt that there are many difficult problems. Of
all the problems mentioned, the DEA does not propose to solve any
of them by throwing people in prison. </p>

<p>The final question here asks for a commitment to
&quot;stopping drugs&quot; which, the DEA itself admits, is
clearly impossible. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Furthermore, ask proponents of legalization just what they are
proposing be legalized. Just marijuana? Marijuana and heroin? All
drugs? </p>

<p>And for what age group? Will children be able to buy drugs? </p>

<p>Will prescriptions be necessary? </p>

<p>And what will they tolerate as the price of legalization? A
permanent underclass of drug users? </p>

<p>Will a 10% increase in the number of traffic fatalities be
accepted? What about 50%? </p>

<p>Would they be relieved to know that their child care provider
had been smoking legally-purchased marijuana? How many
borderbabies is too many? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The question really is: for what drugs are we willing to throw
people in prison? </p>

<p>Can children buy drugs now? Obviously, they can because only
the outlaws control distribution of drugs. The questions try to
insinuate that people in favor of reform want to distribute drugs
to children. Nothing could be further from the truth. The
question also conveniently ignores the fact that the number one
drug killer, tobacco, is still freely available to children
through vending machines. </p>

<p>There are any number of possible policies, besides the current
one. The question of whether prescriptions would be necessary
should not stop us from recognizing that prison is unnecessary. </p>

<p>We already have a permanent underclass of drug users. </p>

<p>There is no evidence that the number of traffic fatalities
would change. About half of all traffic fatalities are now caused
by alcohol, but the DEA does not propose that arresting all the
people who drink beer or wine is a sensible solution. </p>

<p>The laws and social rules for things such as caring for
children would not change regardless of the legal status of any
drug. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> The 1993 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, released
in July, 1994, demonstrates unequivocally that drug use declined
significantly between 1979 and 1993. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The same figures show it is going back up again, particularly
among children. Those figures show large increases in the last
year alone -- and the laws have not changed. </p>

<p>It must also be recognized that the data gathering methods of
this survey are open to question. The survey is conducted by
calling people at random on the telephone and asking if anyone in
the household has committed a felony (used drugs) in the past few
weeks or months. Instead of an accurate measure of the amount of
drug use, it may just be a measure of the number of people who
are stupid enough to answer such a question from a stranger on
the phone. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> In 1993, an estimated 11.7 million Americans were current
illicit drug users, meaning they had used an illicit drug in the
month prior to the interview. This represents no change from 1992
when the estimate was 11.4 million. The number of illicit drug
users had been declining since its peak in 1979 at 24 million. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA needs to take elementary math again. The figures shown
represent a rise of 300,000 drug users. </p>

<p>The figures show one thing above all else-- there is no way we
can throw that many people in prison, and our jails are full
already. How many of these millions does the DEA propose that we
throw in prison? </p>

<p>The DEA's own figures also clearly show that all of the
supposed decline in drug use has been among casual drug users.
Their own figures show that this policy has had no effect on the
number of hard core drug users, where the problem really lies. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> The number of current cocaine users remained at 1.3 million
users in 1993, the same as 1992. This is down from a peak of 5.3
million in 1985. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Does the DEA suggest that we throw all 1.3 million cocaine
users in prison? </p>

<p>Since 1979, rates of current illicit drug use have dropped for
12 17 year olds, 1825 year olds, and 2634 year olds, but not for
the age group 35 and older. </p>

<p>The latest figures show that drug use among these groups has
risen dramatically again, and yet the laws are just as harsh as
they always were. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Teenage drug consumption, despite recent upturns, is down
in the long term. There is an obvious concern in the United
States about the consumption of drugs by teenagers--the adults of
tomorrow. Recent upturns demonstrate to us the clear need to
continue doing what we've done for more than the past decade:
combine law enforcement, education, and international efforts to
address all aspects of the drug situation. The Monitoring the
Future Study, conducted annually by University of Michigan
research scientists for the US Department of Health and Human
Services, has been tracking the drug consumption of American high
school seniors since the 1970s. In the past few years, the study
has been broadened to embrace drug use by 10th grade and 8th
grade students as well. </p>

<p><a name="DDE_LINK10"><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif"
align="bottom" width="562" height="19"></a> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is obviously wrong. See the latest figures cited above. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>When the first Monitoring the Future Study was published, 27.1
% of the members of the Class of 1975 (eighth and 10th graders
were not surveyed then) reported having used marijuana or hashish
in the previous month. The figure for the Class of 1980 was
33.7%--which puts that 2.4% figure 13 years later into
perspective. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>If the study is looking at the drug use of eighth to tenth
graders then it would seem obvious enough that the campaign to
put people in prison would not have had much real effect on this
group. This is evidence that any drop in use was not due to
tougher criminal enforcement. </p>

<h2>CLAIM IX: DRUG PROHIBITION IS WORKING </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization advocates claim that drug prohibition is akin to
alcohol prohibition earlier this century. Their main premise is
that it is impossible to prohibit people from using substances
that they want to use. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>It seems obvious that it is impossible, by the DEA's own
evidence. But there are other reasons as well. Even if it was
possible, we should not undertake actions which do more harm than
good. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Participants in the AntiLegalization forum felt that
legalization opponents should point to the successes of
Prohibition and to continuously stress the positive progress that
has been made between 1979 and 1994 in reducing levels of drug
abuse. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Does the DEA feel that the &quot;successes of
Prohibition&quot; were so great that we should bring back
Prohibition? Why not? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>When the Volstead Act was repealed, arrests for alcohol
traffickers disappeared, but arrests of alcohol related incidents
rose, indicating that the prohibition against alcohol had kept
people from using it. The same will happen if drugs are
legalized. Once drug use is sanctioned by the government, more
people will use drugs. </p>

<p>It is also important to remember that after Prohibition was
repealed, organized crime branched out into other areas, and
there is every expectation that current drug organizations would
also continue and diversify. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>After Prohibition was repealed, organized crime lost its
single biggest source of funding. This is the same argument the
DEA made before, that we must keep drug prohibition to keep the
drug dealers employed so they will not do something else. Again,
we have to asked what would happen if the DEA really did succeed
in stamping out drugs. Would we have to start selling them again
to keep the criminals from doing something else? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> Dr. Mark Moore, in a 1992 article titled &quot;Actually,
Prohibition Was a Success&quot; points out that alcohol
consumption declined during the Prohibition years by as much as
3050%. Mental hospital admissions from alcoholinduced psychosis
declined 50%. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The Wickersham Commission, which was formed to study and
improve Prohibition, found that alcohol use fell in the first
year of Prohibition and rose every year thereafter. </p>

<p>Assuming this was true, does that mean that the DEA is
advocating the return of alcohol Prohibition? Why not? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Robert Peterson, Director of the Michigan Office of Drug
Control Policy, states that &quot;Since the repeal of
Prohibition, alcohol consumption has tripled.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Does this mean that the DEA is advocating the return of
alcohol Prohibition? Why not? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Alcohol, unlike currently illegal drugs, has a long history
of social acceptance and has an important role in many cultures.
Alcohol can also be selfadministered in small doses with little
damaging effects. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA is saying that some drugs can be sold in the local
store, while others merit a term in prison if you possess them.
The difference, it seems, is based on their popularity. By this
argument, when these drugs reach a certain level of popularity
then it will be appropriate to sell them as we do alcohol and
tobacco. </p>

<p>Other drugs also have a long history of social acceptance
which the DEA would like to deny. Marijuana (hemp), for example,
was once this nation's largest crop and was even grown by our
founding fathers such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. </p>

<p>Most drugs can be self-administered in small doses with little
damaging effects and, in most examples of their use, they are. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>We are making progress in reducing the number of illicit drug
users. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Even if one believes the DEA's figures on this score (and
there is good reason to doubt them), the DEA's own figures show
that there has been no effect on hard core drug use. Further,
there is no evidence that the current policy is the best way to
reduce the number of drug users of any type. <br>

<h1>The Washington Hemp Education Network </h1>

<p> <strong>Operating Abstract</strong> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2>Abstract </h2>

<p> The following text defines the structure and mission of a
non-profit educational organization known as the Washington Hemp
Education Network (W.H.E.N.). This organization consists of
volunteer members. </p>

<h2>Mission Statement </h2>

<p> The mission of the Washington Hemp Education Network
(W.H.E.N.) is to empower the people of Washington State, through
educational activities about the history, status, and uses (both
current and potential) of the Hemp plant (cannabis sativa, also
known as marijuana), to make informed choices about the issues
surrounding re-legalization of Hemp in Washington State. </p>

<h2>Recognition of Benefit </h2>

<p> The Washington Hemp Education Network recognizes as
beneficial all responsible commercial, medicinal, and spiritual
uses of the Hemp plant conducted for peaceful ends. </p>

<h2>Program and Goals </h2>

<p> To achieve the stated mission, the Washington Hemp Education
Network will plan and implement legal, nonviolent projects that: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Raise public awareness of the history and beneficial uses
        of the Hemp plant; </li>
    <li>Educate the public to recognize and reject misinformation
        about Hemp; </li>
    <li>Facilitate changes in current laws to allow the people of
        Washington State to grow Hemp openly and engage in normal
        market activities with Hemp products; </li>
    <li>Through education and coalition, help to empower people
        who have been disempowered by misguided government
        policies concerning Hemp; </li>
    <li>Promote research and development of sustainable,
        environmentally responsible Hemp cultivation, and of
        beneficial products derived from Hemp. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Project Criteria </h3>

<p> All projects planned and implemented by the Washington Hemp
Education Network will be consistent with the Mission,
Recognition of Benefit, and Program and Goals statements defined
herein. </p>

<h3>Endorsement and Support </h3>

<p> The Washington Hemp Education Network will endorse and
support only those projects undertaken by individuals or other
entities that are consistent with the Mission, Recognition of
Benefit, and Program and Goals. </p>

<h2>Method of Operation </h2>

<p> This organization will meet regularly and will operate on the
principle of consensus. As defined by the Center for Conflict
Resolution, Madison, WI, consensus is &quot;a decision-making
process in which all parties involved explicitly agree to the
final decision. </p>

<p> Consensus decision making does not mean that all parties are
completely satisfied with the final outcome, but that the
decision is acceptable to all because no one feels that his or
her vital interests or values are violated by it.&quot; </p>

<p> A board of directors will not be elected; rather, the
founding charter members will constitute the decision-making
body, will serve as the projects and issues forum facilitation
group, and will exercise no power other than that of presiding
over meetings as defined by the Method of Operation, and of
approving membership applications and filling vacancies in the
charter member group when a charter member leaves the group. </p>

<p> Other future members may be added to the decision-making body
of charter members if a consensus decision for such action is
made by the charter members. Members other than charter members
are encouraged to participate in discussions on issues that are
being addressed during the decision-making process; participation
in the final consensus </p>

<p> decision is limited to charter members. </p>

<h3>Consensus Procedures </h3>

<ul>
    <li>o For each meeting, the charter members will appoint a
        rotating clerk, who will convene the meeting and govern
        the discussions during the meeting. The clerk is
        responsible for compiling and disseminating the agenda
        and supporting materials at least four days prior to the
        meeting. </li>
    <li>o If one or more members feel that a decision must be
        reached, the clerk must clearly state the issue to be
        decided and allow each member to speak uninterrupted
        about the issue. After each member speaks once about the
        issue, it can be debated if necessary by the group;
        however, members must not interrupt other speakers and
        must wait until granted the floor by the clerk before
        speaking. </li>
    <li>o Members must listen attentively and strive to
        understand each point of view, knowing that through the
        consensus process each decision must ultimately be a
        compromise of all points of view. </li>
    <li>o The clerk will develop a decision statement as the
        debate proceeds. The clerk will then document the
        evolution of the debate and will modify the position of
        the group by incorporating each point of view into the
        decision statement. </li>
    <li>o When all points of view have been made known, and the
        decision statement has reached a static state, the clerk
        will call for consensus on the statement. Three possible
        positions may be taken by the charter members: Consent,
        Object, or Stand Aside: </li>
    <li>o Consent indicates the member agrees to support the
        decision as the best compromise that can be achieved by
        the group. </li>
    <li>o Object indicates the member will not allow consensus to
        occur; if ONE member objects, the decision is discarded
        and no action is taken on the issue by the organization
        at that time. </li>
    <li>o Stand Aside indicates the member cannot agree with the
        decision but will not prevent the decision from being
        adopted </li>
    <li>by the group; the decision stands as long as no one
        indicates </li>
</ul>

<h2>Object. </h2>

<p> These procedures should suffice for most issues facing the
charter members of W.H.E.N. If a situation should arise that
cannot be resolved by the above procedures, the clerk will
reference the consensus handbook published by the Center for
Conflict Resolution. Charter members who are absent from
announced meetings are by default relinquishing their consensus
vote for the affected meetings only. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<h2>CLAIM IV: ANY REVENUES GENERATED BY TAXING LEGALIZED DRUGS
WOULD QUICKLY EVAPORATE IN LIGHT OF THE INCREASED SOCIAL COSTS
ASSOCIATED WITH LEGALIZING DRUGS. </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>A favorite argument in support of legalization is that
education, health care, road building and a wide array of other
worthwhile causes would benefit from the taxes that could be
raised by legalizing drugs and then taxing them. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>On the whole, it certainly seems better than sending all that
money to Colombia. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The conference participants were extremely skeptical about the
claim of a large tax windfall, and challenged advocates to prove
that the amounts of revenue potentially generated by legalization
would counterbalance the increased social costs that would result
from making drugs legal. When asked for specifics, they have no
answers. </p>

<p>Are they taking into account the erosion of the tax base as
more and more citizens are unable to work because of drug
addiction? Add to this loss the cost of health and welfare
benefits for the unemployed. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>There is no tax windfall, large or small, right now. The only
revenue generated is the revenue generated from money and
property seizures, which is fraught with its own problems. </p>

<p>The DEA has asked the American taxpayers to support an
open-ended program of building more prisons. When they are asked
for specifics, such as how many prisons they propose to build,
they have no answers. </p>

<p>Does the DEA take into account the erosion of the tax bases by
the fact that -- by their own estimates -- two-thirds of the
people they propose to throw in prison are gainfully employed
taxpayers? Does the DEA take into account the fact that, once
these people have a prison record, they may be permanently
unemployed because no one wants to hire an ex-convict? Putting
people in prison doesn't do anything to reduce unemployment
problems, except for prison guards. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Health and societal costs of drug legalization would increase.
The panel predicted that drug treatment costs, hospitalization
for longterm drug related disease, and treatment of the
consequences of family violence would further burden our already
strapped health care system. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Every major study of drug policy disagreed with this point.
See the list elsewhere on these pages. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>There is also real reason to believe that liability suits
would be brought against manufacturers and distributors of drugs
as damages to individuals increased, thereby increasing the cost
of products. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>As opposed to the current situation, where there is no one to
bring a liability suit against. </p>

<p>Liability suits have not yet put the alcohol and tobacco
industries out of business, or made their products too expensive.
If this was a real concern, alcohol and tobacco would still be
the major concerns. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Ask legalization proponents if the alleged profits from drug
legalization would be enough to pay for the increased fetal
defects, loss of workforce productivity, increased traffic
fatalities and industrial accidents, increased domestic violence
and the myriad other problems that would not only be high income
items, but extremely expensive in terms of social decay. How much
are they willing to pay? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The number of fetal defects caused by alcohol are far greater
than the number for illegal drugs so this argument is a red
herring. If the DEA was really concerned about fetal defects,
they would concentrate on alcohol first. </p>

<p>The DEA acts like these problems are not here already, and
that the best method of preventing them is to throw people in
prison. In every case, these problems are already here, and
throwing people in prison is not the best approach to the
problem. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p>Dr. William Olson, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
for International Narcotics Matters, outlines the magnitude of
the social costs borne now by U.S. taxpayers because of drugs. In
his 1994 essay, &quot;Drug Legalization: Getting to No,&quot; he
provides the following: </p>

<p> 2560 percent of the homeless are addicts, whose
homelessness is in large part the result of addiction and their
inability to manage money or make rational, reasonable decisions.
They are increasingly supported at public expense. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is the result of the current policy which is, in itself,
a good argument against what we are doing. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> 7580 percent of the 1.2 1.5 million teenage runaways are
substance abusers, and not because prohibition made them use
drugs or run away. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>No, and prohibition didn't keep them from using drugs either.
Runaways are usually children who have severe problems at home
which cause them to engage in all sorts of deviant behavior. The
drug laws do not do anything to address the underlying problem.
The law only makes the runaways' problems worse if they are
caught using drugs. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> 3050 percent of mental patients are chemical abusers, 5060
percent of these crack and cocaine. They are largely on public
support. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The only thing this would show is that people with severe
mental problems are likely to try to self-medicate themselves. It
does not show any causal connection between drug use and
insanity, except perhaps that insanity causes greater drug use.
It says even less about what would a sensible public policy for
addressing the problem. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> As many as 11 percent of young mothers use drugs during
pregnancy. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is what is happening under the current system. A more
sensible approach might reduce the number. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> 2.5 percent of all live births, some 100,000 babies are
born addicted to cocaine. They have lifelong learning
disabilities and emotional problems. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>There is no support for this claim at all and the DEA knows
it. The DEA is lying. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> $50 billion is devoted annually to dealing with the health
care costs of drug addiction and its collateral costs. These will
not disappear with legalization. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Those costs haven't disappeared with prohibition either. In
fact, every major study of the subject says that prohibition only
makes those costs greater. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> There are approximately 500,000 heroin and 2 million other
substance abusers. Their care is increasingly a demand on
society. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>According to the DEA's own figures, shown above, the current
policies have had no effect on this problem at all. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> There is no way to predict how much revenue would be
generated by the United States Government taxing legalized drugs.
Such a scenario depends entirely upon the parameters of
legalization, and what the policy means vis a vis sources of
drugs. If U.S. farmers were given subsidies to produce drugs (as
they are given subsidies for tobacco) the U.S. taxpayers would be
responsible for paying for these subsidies. If foreign sources of
drugs (opium or coca) were allowed to supply the raw material for
these products, an elaborate system of tariffs and trade
preferences would need to be established. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>It is true that there is no way to predict tax revenues until
one makes some assumptions about &quot;legalization&quot;. One of
the reasons is that the DEA doesn't have a clue how big the
market for drugs really is. This should not stop us from
recognizing that prison is a net revenue loser. </p>

<p>These are curious arguments. They bring up the question of
whether we should have subsidies for tobacco in the first place,
especially in view of the fact that it kills 100 times as many
people as all the illegal drugs combined. Why does our government
give subsidies to tobacco farmers while it throws marijuana
(hemp) farmers in prison? Our drug laws plainly make no sense at
all. </p>

<p>Trade and tariffs would be handled as they would for any other
commodity and the fact that tariffs might be complicated is not a
good argument for throwing American citizens in prison. </p>

<p>We also have to ask, who controls the trade and tariffs now?
And what are the trade and tariff rules now? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Taxes would likely push the cost of the product up. Taxing
the drugs would make them more expensive at the checkout counter.
The drug cartels do not provide a share of their receipts to
their respective governments. They are all business. Anyone going
into competition with them, including the U.S. Government, would
have to be all business too, prepared to cut prices, if
necessary, to stay in the game. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Prohibition pushes the cost of the product up. The main
difference would be that the revenues would not be used to fund
other crime. </p>

<p>The same arguments were equally true of alcohol during alcohol
Prohibition. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Legalized gambling has not put illegal gambling out of
business. In fact, legalized gambling has produced a whole new
group of people who cannot control their need to gamble. Many
states have gone into the gambling business to raise funds for
public purposes, with some success, although as more
jurisdictions get into it the profits decline. Meanwhile, bookies
ply their trade as they always have. The reason is the payoff
they offer is better than the legal gambling schemes. For every
million dollars wagered, that is, they return a higher percentage
to the winners. Again, it' s a matter of overhead. The bookies
are not trying to build schools, so they don't have to earmark a
percentage of the profits for such endeavors. So long as that is
so, they will always have a market that is loyal to them. The
same situation could logically occur if drugs were legal. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>And prohibition has not put the drug dealers out of business,
it has only made them richer. </p>

<p>In places where gambling is legal, illegal bookies do not have
higher payoffs than the legal gambling schemes, except in the
case of state lotteries which have notoriously poor payoff
percentages. </p>

<p>No one contends that any scheme will entirely eliminate the
black market in drugs, and the current policy is the best
example. However, a better policy could greatly reduce many of
the problems associated with the black market, as happened with
the repeal of alcohol Prohibition. <br>

<h2>CLAIM VII: ALCOHOL HAS CAUSED SIGNIFICANT HEALTH, SOCIAL AND
CRIME PROBLEMS IN THIS COUNTRY, AND LEGALIZED DRUGS WOULD ONLY
MAKE THE SITUATION WORSE </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Many legalization advocates are fond of comparing the use of
alcohol with the use of drugs, yet draw faulty conclusions from
the comparison. People often consume small amounts of wine or
beer as a beverage and do not necessarily drink to the point of
mental impairment. This is not true of drug use, where the whole
point of use is intoxication. A more accurate analogy would be to
compare drug use to drunkenness. Yet even that analogy is weak,
because drugs are far more addictive than alcohol, and have no
cultural or social value. Dr. Mitchell Rosenthal points out, for
example, that only 10 percent of drinkers become alcoholics,
while up to 75 percent of regular illicit drug users become
addicted. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The point of use of alcohol is intoxication, just as it is for
the illegal drugs. Even small amounts of alcohol will relax a
person or change their mood. This is intoxication, it is just a
mild intoxication. If you don't want the intoxication, there is
very little reason to drink alcoholic wine or beer instead of
their non-alcoholic versions. The alcoholic versions are the
major sellers so it is a fair assumption that most alcohol
drinkers want the mild intoxication which comes from a couple of
beers. </p>

<p>Most users of most drugs want a relatively mild intoxication
from their drug of choice. That is one of the main reasons that
wine and beer outsell the harder beverages, and why most illegal
drug use is the use of marijuana. </p>

<p>This argument is a distortion in itself because it lumps all
illicit drugs together, as if they had the same capacity to
addict. Clearly, there are major differences between drugs such
as heroin, cocaine, and marijuana, and Dr. Rosenthal is
irresponsible not to point them out. </p>

<p>Dr. Rosenthal's figures could not possibly be true, based on
the DEA's own evidence shown above in their chart showing the
supposed drop in drug use. The DEA's own figures shows the number
of regular drug users is far higher than the number of addicts
and always has been. By the DEA's own figures at least 85 percent
are not addicted, and at least 70 percent are gainfully employed.
</p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization note--correctly--that alcohol kills
many more Americans than do illegal drugs and currently exact
social and financial costs that are higher as well. Advocates
claim that many people do not use alcohol, and that many
Americans may also choose to forego drugs. Like treatment
programs available for alcohol addicted people, treatment for
drug addicts should be more widely available. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA admits that alcohol causes far more damage than the
illegal drugs but they don't seem to propose that we bring back
alcohol Prohibition. </p>

<p>What the DEA does not say is the degree to which alcohol and
tobacco cause more damage than illegal drugs. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The experts assembled at the AntiLegalization Forum pointed to
already overburdened health care and social systems that are
unable to address all the problems associated with alcohol use.
Instead of compounding these problems, and acknowledging the
crime problems made worse by alcohol use, the group stated that
legalizing drugs would create undue burdens on the criminal,
health and social service systems. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The group points out that the &quot;already overburdened
health care and social systems . . . are unable to address all
the problems associated with alcohol use&quot;, yet no one
proposes that we bring back alcohol Prohibition as the best
approach to the problem. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Alcohol use in this country has taken a tremendous physical
toll on Americans, not to mention the social problems that have
resulted from its use. Legalization proponents would have us
compound our problems by creating a new class of drug addicted
Americans. Again, how much are we willing to tolerate? To pay
for? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Should we bring back alcohol Prohibition as a means of dealing
with alcohol problems? Clearly not. The message of Prohibition is
clear: Alcohol is bad, but Prohibition is worse. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Look at the problems that alcohol abuse has wrought. In the
1920s those advocating the repeal of Prohibition argued that
crime and other social ills would be alleviated if alcohol were
legal. Has that happened? We now have approximately 11 million
alcoholics or problem drinkers in this country whose behavior has
contributed to lost productivity in the workplace, fetal defects,
traffic fatalities, domestic violence and other crime. If drugs
were made legal, the numbers and the problems would swell. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Is the DEA arguing that the best approach to the alcohol
problems is to bring back Prohibition? Why not? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The simple fact is that if drugs are made legal, more people
will use drugs. There will be higher health and social costs;
there will be more crime. Some facts which help to confirm the
observations of the forum participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The Wickersham Commission, which was originally formed to
improve alcohol Prohibition, found that alcohol use fell in the
first year of Prohibition but rose every year thereafter. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> In a May, 1993 report titled &quot;Survey of State Prison
Inmates,&quot; the Bureau of Justice Statistics states that 32%
of inmates committed their offense under the influence of
alcohol. Slightly more than twofifths of inmates convicted of
homicide or assault committed their current offense under the
influence of alcohol or of alcohol with drugs. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is another curious argument. It is clear that the biggest
problem here is alcohol, as the DEA itself states. If the DEA was
really consistent in their position, they would advocate the
return of alcohol prohibition. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> According to the 1993 National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse, about 11 million Americans were heavy drinkers in 1993
(drinking five or more drinks per occasion on five or more days
in the past 30 days). Heavy alcohol use has changed little since
1985, when there were 12 million heavy drinkers. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Assuming the figures are accurate, it would obviously not be a
sensible approach to the problem to attempt throw all these
people in prison. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The same report indicates that &quot;of the 11 million heavy
drinkers in 1993, 26 percent (3 million) were also current
illicit drug users.&quot; The report goes on to say that
&quot;Current smokers are more likely to be heavy drinkers and
illicit drug users. Among smokers in 1993, 11 percent were heavy
drinkers and 12 percent were illicit drug users.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA seems to be trying to make the discredited argument
about &quot;gateway drugs&quot;. That is, they used to contend
that some drugs, by some as-yet-unexplained process, naturally
created a craving for totally unrelated drugs in people who had
never used drugs before. This was a holdover from their earlier,
plainer and even more easily discredited argument that marijuana
leads to heroin. (Which, by the way, was in direct contradiction
to Harry Anslinger's testimony before Congress when marijuana was
outlawed.) </p>

<p>People who engage in one form of risky behavior often engage
in other risky behaviors. That is the only thing that these kinds
of statistics could show. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> In a 1993 report by Brandeis University, it was estimated
that the United States spent $10.5 billion on health care related
to alcohol use. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Then why shouldn't we bring back Prohibition as the best way
to deal with the problem? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Alcohol is blamed for between $140 and $210 billion per
year in lost productivity. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Then why shouldn't we bring back Prohibition as the best way
to deal with the problem? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> 17,461 people were killed in alcohol related traffic
incidents in 1993. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>That is almost as many people as the American Medical
Association estimates were killed by all illegal drugs from all
causes combined. Clearly, if the DEA wanted to do something about
the real drug problem, it would be of more benefit to concentrate
their enforcement efforts on alcohol. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Michigan's Director of the Office of Drug Control Policy,
Robert Peterson, states that &quot;It is estimated that alcohol
abuse costs the nation $100 billion per year and over 300 lives
per day, an amount that the $18 billion in state and federal
excise tax revenue does not begin to cover.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"

<p>And yet no one contends that throwing wine and beer drinkers
in prison is a sensible approach to this problem. <br>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<h2>CLAIM V: THERE ARE NO COMPELLING MEDICAL REASONS TO PRESCRIBE
MARIJUANA OR HEROIN TO SICK PEOPLE. </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>It is quite easy to refute this argument for both drugs. </p>

<p>Medically speaking, heroin is simply a stronger form of
morphine. Therefore, if there is a legitimate medical use for
morphine, then there is a legitimate medical use for heroin.
Heroin was once used medically in a manner similar to morphine
and was even used for pain relief during childbirth. Doctors
state that heroin is a good drug for medical use because it is
safe, powerful, and short acting. Recent research indicates that
pain-killers can be important healing agents after patients
undergo major surgery, because these drugs reduce the stress on
the central nervous system. In some cases, the amount of time
required to heal can be cut in half. Some research shows that the
best doses of morphine are perhaps ten times what they were
considered to be just a decade ago. </p>

<p>In the case of marijuana (hemp), there is already an approved
prescription drug, Marinol, which is derived from the primary
active ingredient in marijuana and used for the conditions for
which marijuana (hemp) is recommended. Marijuana (hemp) itself
would not be approved as a prescription drug because of FDA rules
which state that a medicine must consist of only the active
ingredients and a filler. Therefore, the rules themselves
prohibit the approval of any natural substances such as a plant,
even though the active ingredients in the plant and the
prescription drug are precisely the same. </p>

<p>The question then becomes, why should a sick person pay sixty
dollars a pill when they can grow the same medicine in their own
backyard for free? </p>

<p>Some patients report that the homegrown version of the
medicine is far superior to the prescription version for a couple
of reasons. One reason is that marijuana (hemp) is often used to
treat nausea and it is often hard to keep pills in their stomach
when they have nausea. Some of them have complained that it is
awfully depressing to vomit up a sixty dollar pill. Therefore, it
is better if the medicine is smoked because it bypasses the
stomach and gets the medicine into the body much more quickly.
Another reason that some sick people prefer marijuana (hemp) over
Marinol is that Marinol makes them &quot;higher than a
kite&quot;, and they don't want to be high, they just want their
medical symptoms relieved. By smoking marijuana (hemp), they can
limit the amount of &quot;high&quot; they get. </p>

<p>Marijuana (hemp) has traditionally been used in medicines for
thousands of years. Prior to 1937, it was the most common
agricultural crop in America and was used for literally thousands
of purposes, including rope, cloth, paper, fuel, and medicine. It
was prescribed for a wide variety of ailments and was included in
up to two-thirds of all over the counter preparations. Prior to
1937, cannabis (hemp) was completely unregulated and it would
have been impossible to regulate cannabis (hemp) because it was a
major agricultural crop grown nearly everywhere. Cannabis (hemp)
derivatives were included in a wide variety of items consumed by
the general public. Despite this widespread, unregulated
consumption, there were no reported problems. The American
Medical Association was opposed to the marijuana (hemp) laws in
1937 for these reasons. The promoters of these laws openly lied
about the AMA's attitude toward the law in order to get it
passed. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>It is often suggested that, even if currently controlled
substances are not made available to the general public, some of
them, particularly marijuana and heroin, could be used to relieve
suffering. </p>

<p>Participants in the AntiLegalization Forum acknowledged that
arguments urging the medical use of marijuana are often used as
an entree into the legalization debate. Medical use arguments can
garner public support because they seem harmless enough to the
uninformed audience. The experts agreed that these issues are
peripheral to the real issue. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA has no business making decisions or statements about
the proper medical use of anything. The fact that they do is only
one more example of what is wrong with our current drug policy. </p>

<p>There should be no argument at all that it is up to the
medical profession and its patients to define what is, or is not,
a proper medical treatment. The police do not have the required
professional knowledge to determine proper medical uses, they do
not know what difficulties individual patients may face in their
treatment or what benefits patients might receive, and they care
even less. It is absurd to pretend that complex medical decisions
can be made for every patient in the United States by an
organization such as the DEA. </p>

<p>The problem goes beyond the illegal drugs such as marijuana
and heroin. The problem extends to pain killers of all types in
general. The severity of this problem was seen in the recent case
of Florida versus Martinez. </p>

<p>Mr. Martinez was a lay AIDS counselor who ran a drug buyers
club for AIDS patients. A drug buyers club purchases medical
drugs which are available in other countries but not in the
United States and distributes them to sick people here. Mr.
Martinez was charged with distributing morphine without medical
training or a license. </p>

<p>Mr. Martinez did not deny the fact that he distributed
morphine to people and that he was in violation of the drug laws.
His only defense was that his actions were a medical necessity,
because of the barbaric policies of the DEA against people who
were in pain. The defense brought forth experts who testified how
the DEA had prosecuted and imprisoned doctors for prescribing
Tylenol 3 -- Tylenol with codeine -- a drug which is not even a
prescription drug except in the United States and South Africa,
and the US is the only control in the world which has ever sent a
doctor to prison for prescribing it. They testified about AIDS
patients who suffer from a nerve degeneration all over their body
which makes them scream in pain every time they are even touched.
For many of them, a simple bath can be painful beyond belief, and
yet they cannot get pain medication because their doctors are
often afraid to prescribe it because they fear what the DEA could
do to them. </p>

<p>After the jury heard the evidence on the government's drug
policy, they voted unanimously for acquittal. This trial was
shown on Court TV and has been repeated many times because it is
one of the most interesting trials they have ever shown. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The medical pros and cons of prescribing marijuana and heroin
to sick people are best debated by medical professionals. It
should be kept in mind, however, that marijuana has been rejected
as medicine by the American Medical Society, the American
Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the
International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies, and the
American Cancer Society. </p>

<p>HHS report </p>

<p>Not one American health association accepts marijuana as
medicine. Statements issued by these organizations express
concern over the harmful effects of the drugs and over the lack
of solid research demonstrating that they might do more good than
harm. </p>

<p>The International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies,
for instance, said in a statement issued by its Therapeutic
Claims Committee in 1992: &quot;Further studies are required to
determine whether marijuana has a clinically useful effect on
multiple sclerosis. In view of the possible toxic effects of
longterm use, its use cannot be recommended. In the opinion of
the committee, there appears to be no generally accepted
scientific basis for use of this therapy. It has never been
tested in a properly controlled trial. Longterm use may be
associated with significant serious side effects.&quot; </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> Under the federal statute known as the Controlled
Substances Act, regulated drugs are divided into categories known
as schedules. In Schedule I, for instance, are drugs with a high
potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use in
treatment in the United States. At the other end of the spectrum
is Schedule V, which is for drugs that have a low potential for
abuse and have a currently accepted medical use in treatment in
the United States. The Act provides a mechanism for substances to
be controlled (added to a schedule), decontrolled (removed from
control), or rescheduled (transferred from one schedule to
another). </p>

<p>Heroin and marijuana are in Schedule I; cocaine, which is
sometimes used as a local anesthetic, is in Schedule II. Much of
the debate about medical uses for currently illegal drugs
concerns substituting heroin for morphine and supplying marijuana
to AIDS and glaucoma patients or using it to treat side effects
of chemotherapy. </p>

<p> A petition to put marijuana in a less restrictive schedule
of the CSA was rejected by then DEA Administrator John C. Lawn,
after public hearings, on December 29, 1989. The United States
Court of Appeals ordered further proceedings, however, to clear
up what it felt were some ambiguities in the record.
Administrator Robert C. Bonner, who succeeded Lawn, complied and
issued a new ruling on March 26, 1992. &quot;By any modern
scientific standard, marijuana is no medicine, &quot; Bonner
said. The three judge appeals court upheld the ruling unanimously
on February 18, 1994. &quot;Our review of the record convinces us
that the Administrator's findings are supported by substantial
evidence,&quot; the court said, noting the &quot;testimony of
numerous experts that marijuana' s medicinal value has never been
proven in sound scientific studies.&quot; <br>

<h1>How to Hold Your Own In a Drug Legalization Debate </h1>

<h1>THE TEN CLAIMS </h1>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The three groups discussing legalization at Quantico touched
on a number of significant issues. It was evident to the
participants that the prolegalization arguments have remained
fairly consistent over the years and that there are ten major
claims that can be made in opposition of legalization. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The participants have missed the point again. The arguments
have changed over the last few years in particular, which is what
brought them to Quantico in the first place. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>We have attempted to provide the ten simple, compelling claims
to help you frame your arguments against legalization. The claims
are backed up by facts, quotes and statistics. Periodically,
these will need to be updated to ensure that the most current
information is being used to craft arguments against
legalization. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>In this booklet, the DEA puts its arguments on the line. When
these ten claims are gone, it will have no more argument for
continuing this drug war. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<h2>CLAIM I: CRIME, VIOLENCE AND DRUG USE GO HAND IN HAND </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>In this claim, the DEA does the first of its major distortions
- the lumping together of all drugs into the same group.
Different drugs have different effects and, for some drugs, there
is clearly very little association with violence. Marijuana and
tobacco are two examples of drugs with little reason to believe
that they are connected to violence. The DEA does not mention
hemp (marijuana) in this Claim so we must assume that they agree
that this argument would not apply to hemp (marijuana) in any
case. </p>

<p>Even if we accepted the DEA's arguments that drugs, and not
prohibition, causes violence, the best way to reduce the crime
and violence would be to reduce the drug use. There is no
evidence that throwing people in prison is the most effective way
to reduce drug use. All the evidence shows that treatment and
education are more cost-effective. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization contend that if drugs were
legalized, crime and violence would decrease. They believe that
it is the illegal nature of drug production, trafficking and use
that fuels crime and violence. They state that turf wars, gang
activity and drugrelated crimes are the result of the illegal
nature of the drug trade. Proponents state that users commit
crimes to pay for drugs now because they cannot easily obtain
them. If drugs were legal, they say, the enormous profits
associated with drugs because of their illegal status would
evaporate and, once gone, the black market and criminal activity
associated with drugs would also be eliminated. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>If this was really the number one concern of the DEA then they
should be advocating tough prison sentences against alcohol. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Of all psychoactive substances, alcohol is the only one
        whose consumption has been shown to commonly increase
        aggression. . . . </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Alcohol drinking and violence are linked through
        pharmacological effects on behavior, through expectations
        that heavy drinking and violence go together in certain
        settings, and through patterns of binge drinking and
        fighting that sometimes develop in adolescence. . . . </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Illegal drugs and violence are linked primarily through
        drug marketing: disputes among rival distributors,
        arguments and robberies involving buyers and sellers,
        property crimes committed to raise drug money and, more
        speculatively, social and economic interactions between
        the illegal markets and the surrounding communities. . .
        . </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="../govpubs/psycviol.htm">Psychoactive Substances and
Violence</a>, published by the Department of Justice, Series:
Research in Brief, February 1994 </p>

<p>The image of the insanely violent drug user has been a common
argument for drug prohibition since the earliest days of the laws
when the New York Times published front page articles about
&quot;Negro Cocaine Fiends, New Southern Menace&quot;, and quoted
a sheriff saying, &quot;Those cocaine niggers sure are hard to
kill.&quot; (NY Times, February 17, 1914) It is an image which
has been used to justify the cruelest kinds of responses to
social problems, as shown by the sheriff's own words. It never
did have any basis in fact. </p>

<p>The Department of Justice's own research clearly shows that
the only real connection between illegal drugs and violence is
the violence created by the fact that it is illegal. This is the
same kind of violence that we saw with respect to alcohol
Prohibition with the wars between rival alcohol distributors. It
was during this period that the Thompson submachine gun became a
symbol of gangs and Prohibition. All of that ended when
Prohibition ended. Violent crime dropped 65 percent in the year
Prohibition was repealed and it continued to drop every year
thereafter until World War II. (Need citation from Ethan N. on
this one.) We could expect similar results from the repeal of
drug Prohibition. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Participants in the AntiLegalization Forum, who are experts in
crime and violence, disagreed strongly with the notion that crime
and violence would be reduced if drugs were legalized. It is
widely claimed by those advancing the case for legalization that
crime is largely committed by drug traffickers protecting their
turf. Sadly, it is the experience of many local police officers
that crime is committed not only because people want to buy
drugs, but more often because people use drugs. There is no
denying the fact that drug use changes behavior and exacerbates
criminal activity. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The Department of Justice's own studies of the issue disagree.
See the information presented above. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The experts also believe that legalization will lead to
increased availability of drugs, which will, in turn, lead to
increased use. The use of drugs, especially cocaine, crack,
methamphetamine, and PCP is often associated with violent
criminal behavior. There is ample evidence which demonstrates the
links between drugs, violence and crime, and the links between a
currently legal substance--alcohol--and crime is well documented.
Police can attest to the fact that alcohol plays a significant
role in domestic violence cases. Drug use would only swell the
statistics regarding crime, even if the drugs were legally
purchased. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The Department of Justice's own studies of the issue disagree.
</p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization proponents ignore the fact that the people
committing violent crimes are career criminals who will not stop
their illegal activities once drugs are legalized; they will
instead seek new sources of illicit revenue. Criminal activity
would not be reduced as a result of drug legalization any more
than gangster activity disappeared after the Repeal of
Prohibition. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is the argument that if we &quot;legalized&quot; drugs
then the criminals would just find another line of work. There is
nothing else which offers the opportunity to get rich so easily.
By comparison, all the other crimes are hard work. </p>

<p>The DEA says that criminal activity would not be
&quot;reduced&quot; because gangster activity did not
&quot;disappear&quot; after the repeal of Prohibition. Of course,
anyone who has seen &quot;The Untouchables&quot; should know that
gangster activity was significantly &quot;reduced&quot; after the
repeal of Prohibition, even if it did not &quot;disappear&quot;.
Therefore, we could expect similar results again. </p>

<p>This is an interesting argument. We must keep drugs illegal
because it gives work to criminals who might be doing something
more dangerous if we did not. That is, having these people sell
drugs is a good thing because it keeps them out of bigger
trouble. Relatively speaking then, selling drugs is not so bad as
other potential crimes so we should make sure they keep doing it.
</p>

<p>Of course, then the question becomes: What would happen if we
actually did stop the flow of drugs? Would we have to start
manufacturing drugs and distributing them through these same
criminals just to keep them from doing something worse in
society? </p>

<p>According to this argument, we are better off if the drug war
never does succeed. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The group discussed the fallacy that legalizing drugs would
eliminate the black market environment which seems to fuel the
drug trade and its attendant violence. The existence of a black
market is heavily dependent on the parameters set by the
legalizers: which drugs would be legal, the potency level of
drugs and the age at which legal drugs could be purchased. If
drugs were legal for persons over 18, for example, drug
traffickers would still target those 17 and younger; if only
marijuana were legalized, drug traffickers would continue to
traffic in heroin and cocaine. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Who do the drug traffickers target now? What drugs do they
traffic in now? </p>

<p>No sensible person pretends that any drug policy is going to
solve all the problems related to drugs. That is clearly
unrealistic. At the same time, there is no reason to undertake
policies, such as we have now, which only make the situation
worse. </p>

<p>Let's face it. The DEA never has had any effective control
over the drug markets and they never will. By taking this
approach the DEA has insured that only the outlaws will have
control of drug sales and distribution. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> A report in the Journal of the American Medical Association
(7/6/94) reports that cocaine use is linked to high rates of
homicide in New York City and that &quot;homicide victims may
have provoked violence through irritability, paranoid thinking or
verbal and physical aggression which are known to be
pharmacologic effects of cocaine.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DOJ's own studies, mentioned above, tell a different
story. </p>

<p>What the DEA is alluding to here in the last part of this
paragraph is the fact that people are more likely to be victims
or homicide than to be perpetrators of homicide while under the
influence of cocaine. The same statistic is true of alcohol. What
it means is that people who get stoned on anything sometimes do
stupid things, such as getting themselves killed. This is even
more true of alcohol, but does not make a good reason to throw
people in prison for drinking wine or beer. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> An April, 1994 report titled &quot;Violent Drug Related
Crime&quot; compiled by Drug and Crime Data Center and
Clearinghouse indicates that drugs are used by many offenders
committing crimes. In 1991, the following percentages of State
prison inmates involved in violent offenses reported that they
had used drugs at the time the offense was committed. </p>

<p>Violent Offenses: 28% </p>

<p>Homicide: 28% </p>

<p>Sexual Assault: 20% </p>

<p>Robbery: 38% </p>

<p>Assault 23% </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The Drug and Crime Data Center and Clearinghouse reports that
they have no publication with this title. The Sourcebook of
Criminal Justice Statistics of 1992 lists the breakdown of drug
use during commission of violent offenses. The figures shows
that, with the exception of robbery, about 75 to 90 percent of
all the reported drug use was use of alcohol, not illegal drugs.
For robbery, the figures are roughly equal. </p>

<p>People who commit violent crimes are likely to have a lot of
problems in their lives, including use of illegal drugs as well
as higher rates of use of alcohol and tobacco. That doesn't
necessarily mean that one problem is causally related to another.
</p>

<p>Even if we assumed, as the DEA implies, that all of this was
due to illegal drugs, they don't mention comparison data for the
number of people who took whatever drug and did not commit a
violent crime. </p>

<p>Even if we assumed the DEA is right, there is no evidence that
the best way to control the problem is to put people in prison. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Data from the National Institute of Justice (US Department
of Justice) Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program underscore the
crimedrugs link. Of a sample of males arrested in 24 US cities in
1991, the percent testing positive for at least one drug in the
DUF survey ranged from 36% in Omaha to 75% in San Diego. Among
female arrestees, the percent testing positive for any drug
ranged from 45% in San Antonio to 79% in Cleveland </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The data of the Drug Use Forecasting program is interesting
but it does not underscore the crime-drugs link. The data are
simply measures of the number of people arrested who had drugs in
their system. There is no similar comparative data on people who
were not arrested, or did not commit crimes. </p>

<p>It is also a long way from showing any causal relationship
between drugs and crime except, perhaps, for the fact that people
who are stupid enough to get severely drunk or stoned are prone
to do stupid things. That would not make it a good idea to have
drug prohibition any more than the fact that we arrest people who
are drunk and disorderly makes it a good idea to have alcohol
prohibition. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> A May 1993 Bureau of Justice Statistics report states that
&quot;Drug use was common among inmates serving time for
burglary, robbery or drug offenses. Among inmates serving a
sentence for burglary or robbery, about 6 in 10 inmates had used
drugs in the month before the arrest for the current offense, and
about 4 in 10 were under the influence at the time of the
offense.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The number of inmates who used drugs in the month before the
arrest is as irrelevant as the number who drank a beer during the
month before the arrest. </p>

<p>It should be noted that being under the influence of drugs is
a convenient excuse which seems to suit everybody involved in a
criminal prosecution. The defendant can plead that he wasn't
himself because he was out of his mind on drugs and thereby play
on the court's sympathies for leniency. The prosecutors can point
to another horrendous drug problem, which suits their interests
as well. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The same study indicates that female inmates were more likely
than male inmates to have used drugs in the month before the
offense (54% versus 50%) and to have been under the influence at
the time of the offense (36% versus 31 %). </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>How does this show that we ought to have a general program to
imprison women who use drugs? </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Another finding of the study indicated that among 18-49 year
old males, those who had used alcohol, cannabis and cocaine at
some point during the past year were ten times more likely to
commit a violent act (26.1 percent versus 2.7 percent) than those
who used none of the above. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA conveniently ignores the fact that alcohol has the
highest association with violence and that cannabis (hemp) has
none. </p>

<p>The DEA contends that, because someone had a beer up to a year
ago, they are potentially violent today. </p>

<p>There is no evidence of a causal relationship here at all.
Even if there was, there is no evidence that prison would be the
best way to control drug use. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Mitchell S. Rosenthal, M.D., president of a major New York
City drug treatment center, Phoenix House, and chairman of the
New York State Advisory Council on Substance Abuse, notes that
one of the basic contentions of advocates of legalization is that
drug users are essentially normal people. Actually, Dr. Rosenthal
said in a speech in 1993, drugs undo the bounds that keep many
seemingly normal people on an even keel. &quot;The treatment
community does not contend that society is at risk from the
behavior of all drug abusers or even the great majority of
them,&quot; he said. &quot;The case for prohibition rests on the
substantial number of abusers who cross the line from permissible
self-destruction to become 'driven' people, who are 'out of
control' and put others in danger of their risk taking, violence,
abuse or HIV infection.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA argues that drug users are not &quot;essentially
normal people&quot;, even while they state that at least
two-thirds of them are gainfully employed taxpayers. </p>

<p>As for undoing &quot;the bounds that keep many seemingly
normal people on an even keel&quot; and all the other problems
mentioned, these problems are equally true of alcohol. Yet they
do not recommend that we bring back Prohibition of alcohol. </p>

<p>Again, the DEA attempts to lump all drugs together, as if they
all had the same effects. General statements about
&quot;all&quot; drugs are intentionally misleading. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> The International Association of Chiefs of Police published
a report in 1993 titled &quot;Violent Crime in America.&quot; It
states &quot;Drug abuse and crime, both violent and nonviolent,
are linked. National Crime Victimization surveys in 1989 and 1990
revealed over 2,000,000 crimes committed by offenders under the
influence of drugs or alcohol...this represented 36% and 34% of
total violent crime recorded by the surveys.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The important phrase here is &quot;drugs or alcohol&quot;. The
table below shows that alcohol's association with violent crime
is far greater than the association of all illegal drugs
combined. The biggest problem is alcohol, and yet no one is
suggesting that we have a war on booze. </p>

<p>Again, the DEA attempts to lump all drugs together as if they
were all equally responsible for the problems. It is
irresponsible and misleading to lump all drugs together,
particularly in view of the large role that alcohol plays in the
figures. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Bureau of Justice Statistics surveys indicate that
&quot;25% of convicted inmates in jails, 33% of state prisoners,
and 40% of youths in stateoperated facilities admit being under
the influence of an illegal drug at the time of their
offense.&quot; (BJS, Drug and Crime Facts, 1992) </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>One reason is that a large number of them are in jail for
selling illegal drugs. </p>

<p>Again, it is misleading to lump all drugs together as if they
were all equally responsible and to imply a causal relationship. </p>

<p>The more complete figures, in the table below, show a somewhat
different picture. </p>

<h3>Some Effects of Illegal Drugs </h3>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA's table of the effects of illegal drugs is a notable
example of their failure to consider the whole picture. The table
does not include any information on the effects of either alcohol
or tobacco for comparison, even though these drugs are clearly
the bigger problems in our society. </p>

<p>Some of the information in the table the DEA presented is, of
course, patently wrong but, in the interest of brevity, we will
forgo the detailed rebuttal of the information in this table. </p>

<p><b>Speaking Out Against Drug Legalization</b> </p>

<p><b>or How to Hold Your Own in a Drug Legalization Debate</b> </p>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p><strong>by Clifford A. Schaffer</strong> </p>

<p>What follows in these pages is the Drug Enforcement
Administrations's booklet &quot;How to Hold Your Own In a Drug
Legalization Debate&quot; which outlines the top ten reasons why
they think &quot;legalization&quot; is such a bad idea. I will
examine their statements, sentence by sentence, and present
comments. Readers should note that, while the DEA has written a
book on how to survive when defending the War on (Some) Drugs,
the DEA has no interest in coming forward to actually engage in
such a debate. An open and honest public debate is the last the
thing the DEA wants. </p>

<h4>LETTER OF INTRODUCTION </h4>

<p>Dear Reader: </p>

<p>You and I are frequently faced with the need to address many
of the positions which are advocated by those calling for the
legalization of drugs. More and more, the debate on legalization
is being given public airing in the media. Average citizens, fed
up with crime and drugs, are being told that legalization is a
reasonable alternative to the crime problem that so many
communities are struggling against. </p>

<p>You and I know that legalization is not an alternative, <b>but
</b>rather a surrender which will further reduce our quality of
life. Ninety percent of the American people agree that
legalization of drugs would complicate an already devastating
situation. Health and social costs associated with the increased
availability of drugs would break our economy. Crime would not
decrease. The moral fiber of our country would be torn apart. </p>

<p>Those who advocate legalization have many motives. But they
frequently do not have answers to a lot of the questions we are
asking. Legalization is an abstract to many of them. But I can
tell you firsthand, from my thirtyfour years' experience as a
lawenforcement officer at the state level, the damage caused by
drugs is real and lasting. It's not drug laws, or the enforcement
of the drugs laws of our nation that are causing harm--it's the
drugs themselves. </p>

<p>Because we're often called on to speak to the issues, I asked
a number of professionals from the law enforcement, health, and
academic communities to come together for two days to discuss how
we can best address the arguments against legalization. I am well
aware that local law enforcement officials are on the front line
in the battle against drug abuse. For that reason I asked several
police chiefs to participate in the Quantico Conference to give
their expertise and guidance as we formulated our response to
these issues. This guide represents most of the issues and
arguments raised during that time. This booklet is intended as a
resource for you as you are faced with the questions and issues
associated with the debate on the legalization of drugs. While
many professionals participated in the session, the views
represented in this document are the position of the Drug
Enforcement Administration. They represent the consensus of the
assembled group and without necessarily attributing each and
every position to the personal views of each participant. </p>

<p>Please feel free to use the guide in whatever way you feel it
is appropriate. The debate on the legalization of drugs cannot be
won if we remain silent. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p><strong>Thomas A. Constantine</strong> </p>

<p>Administrator </p>

<p>Drug Enforcement Administration </p>

<h3>The Reply to the DEA's Statement</h3>

<hr>

<h4>REPLY TO THE LETTER OF INTRODUCTION </h4>

<p>The DEA really has no business spending taxpayer dollars to
promote their own political agenda. The DEA acts as lobbyist and
public relations firm for themselves and other special interest
groups which benefit from the drug war and it should be stopped. </p>

<p>In the course of this public advocacy the DEA distorts the
truth on many occasions, lies shamefully at times and draws
invalid conclusions from what is true. The purpose of this
booklet was to try to stop the damage being done when the drug
warriors were caught in public spouting the old mythology of the
drug war, but we will demonstrate clear examples of the lies and
distortions here in their book. </p>

<p>We agree that the debate on the legalization of drugs cannot
be won by anyone who remains silent. That is why we challenge the
DEA to bring forth their best against our best in an open public
environment where these issues can be discussed at length. We
have asked for an open debate on this issue since February 23,
1993 when the Resolution for a Federal Commission on Drug Policy
was first signed. It is only the DEA who is afraid to debate this
issue in public. </p>

<p>We challenge the DEA to show the strength and truth of their
arguments by supporting our call for an objective Federal
Commission where all of the issues and evidence can be fully
examined. If they are right, the evidence will show it. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Clifford A. Schaffer <br>

<h2>Presentations to Social Clubs </h2>

<p> <b>How to make presentations to social groups such as
churches, Lions Clubs, Rotary, and other similar groups.</b> </p>

<p> <b>By Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h3>How to find them. </h3>

<p> Many of them will be listed in your local phone directories.
If no chapters of a particular group are listed in your area, it
doesn't necessarily mean they don't exist. You can also look in
the Encyclopedia of Associations, at your local library, to
contact their national headquarters and ask for any chapters in
your area. </p>

<h3>What kind of groups typically have meetings where people can
make presentations? </h3>

<p> Here are just a few examples: </p>

<p> Lions, Rotary, Elks, Moose, churches, synagogues, Chambers of
Commerce, Business groups, other social clubs, political parties,
etc. Any place where more than a few people gather for nearly any
purpose may be an opportunity to make a presentation. </p>

<h3>How to get a date to speak to their group. </h3>

<p> First, put together a coherent, sensible presentation of
material pertinent to your area of interest. It is best to
present factual, interesting material, rather than political
diatribe. Visual displays and graphics are always good to help
keep the audience's interest. </p>

<p> Second, call them. You will be surprised at the number of
social groups which are looking for, or receptive to, speakers.
Calling them is the toughest part for many people, but it is
really easy. The worst that can happen is that they will say no,
and you have heard that before. </p>

<h3>What is interesting to these groups? </h3>

<p> Many of these groups want speakers for their regular
luncheons.all the time for their lunch and, therefore they cover
a wide variety of topics over the year. You will often find a
situation where there is someone who is designated to find good
speakers for the meetings who invariably has a hard time finding
enough interesting speakers to fill the bill. Therefore, in many
cases, there is a wide degree of latitude in what these groups
would like to hear. The facts about hemp are usually interesting
to these groups, but there are any number of other subjects which
would also get a good reception with a good presentation. </p>

<h3>Dress and act conservatively. </h3>

<p> The people in these groups are business people for the most
part, and will expect and appreciate a business like demeanor and
approach. Whether you like it or not, they are most likely to
respond favorably to conservatively dressed and
&quot;normal&quot; looking and acting people, as opposed to the
&quot;hippy&quot; look. </p>

<h3>Use Visual Aids </h3>

<p> Charts, graphs, pictures, and other visual aids can be very
helpful in getting your point across. There are a number of
charts and graphs on these pages as samples of things you might
use. </p>

<h3>Read the Persuasive Strategies and Debate Materials </h3>

<p> These social groups tend to be politically and socially
conservative so wild-eyed arguments about how it is everyone's
right to get loaded will not get a good reception. The best
approach is a soft, factual approach which presents some part of
the vast amount of information which most people don't know about
drugs. Don't promote or even defend the use of drugs, drug
dealers, or anything else that your audience will find hard to
accept. You will often have a long way to go to convince them, so
don't try to bring them too far, too fast. </p>

<h3>But I am afraid to make presentations to groups. </h3>

<p> What are you afraid of? That you will look like a fool? (As
if that hasn't happened before.) Seriously, speaking in front of
a group is one of the items which produces the highest levels of
fear in many people. They realize everyone is looking at them and
they get nervous and freeze up. The more nervous they get, the
more they worry about it, and the more nervous they get. </p>

<p> Forget it. If you are afraid of embarrassing yourself and
looking like a fool, don't worry. In the first place, most people
don't have to stand up in front of a group to look like fools, so
looking like a fool is nothing new. Get over it. Everyone looks
like a fool now and then. The truth is that most members of most
audiences are so awestruck by anyone who can get up in front of
an audience and speak (because they know they couldn't do it
themselves) that they will never notice that you are nervous - at
least not to the degree that you feel nervous. </p>

<p> Experience will get you over it. The first presentation is
the roughest, and from that point it gets progressively easier.
By this time I have done so many, and encountered all the
questions that come up so many times, that I could do these
things in my sleep. There are a lot of other people who are also
quite adept at presentations and they started out as shy
wallflowers just like you. Give it a try. You will find it is a
lot of fun. <br>

the legalization of illicit drugs.  in their book, there is no clear     
                                    definition of &quot;legalization&quot; but,    
                                    whatever it is, they are against

                                    if we will ever do it.  The issue    
                                    is really whether we need serious

                                    to state that the DEA is             
                                    unequivocally opposed to any reform

                                    The availability of alcohol to

                                    reasons that alcohol Prohibition     
                                    was repealed.

                                    there would be cocaine vending       
                                    machines alongside the tobacco

                                    store clerks would wink as they      
                                    sold heroin to children in the same  
                                    way that they wink when they sell    
                                    tobacco, then drug use might         
                                    increase.   If the drug laws are     
                                    somewhat more sensible, there is     
                                    good evidence to believe that drug   
                                    use would drop.

                                    results with the drug problem.  The  
                                    question is whether it does any      
                                    good to enforce those social         
                                    sanctions with prison.  All the      
                                    evidence says that prison does more  
                                    harm than good.

There are a few things to remember  This is no surprise.  There has      
when discussing the legalization    been a concerted media campaign to   
issue.                              instil this belief in the American   
                                    public over the last several

Second, when discussing             Strangely enough, information is     
legalization, it is important that  the one thing that all drug

weakness of the prolegalization                                          
position. Participants in the

Should all drugs be legalized ?     The question is not whether any      
                                    drugs should be &quot;legalized&quot; because  
                                    the DEA itself states further down   
                                    in this book that there is no real   
                                    definition of &quot;legalization.&quot;  Is    
                                    alcohol legal?  In some senses it    
                                    is, and in others it is not.  The    
                                    same is true of many other drugs.    
                                    If the DEA is right, we will never   
                                    &quot;legalize&quot; any of these drugs, so    
                                    they miss the point to focus on      
                                    &quot;legalization.&quot;                      
                                                                         
                                    The real question is prison.  Right  
                                    now we are embarked on a course      
                                    which will incarcerate millions of   
                                    people who, in the view of many of   
                                    the prison wardens in this country,  
                                    don't need to be in prison.  We are  
                                    turning loose violent felons so we   
                                    can incarcerate more drug users.     
                                    With these laws, we have the         
                                    opportunity to imprison literally    
                                    millions of people.  We must decide

                                    policy work.                         
                                                                         
                                    As a personal matter, I don't much   
                                    like cigars.  I think they are       
                                    addictive, dangerous, smelly, and    
                                    disgusting. I cannot understand why  
                                    anyone would want to walk around     
                                    with one of those things stuck in    
                                    their face,  and I make my feelings  
                                    known to anyone who lights one up    
                                    in my presence.  At the same time,   
                                    I don't want to put George Burns in  
                                    prison.                              
                                                                         
                                    No matter what policy we may         
                                    devise, or what name we may call     
                                    it, it is an undeniable truth that   
                                    putting people in prison does no     
                                    good at all.                         

Who will determine which segments   Who determines the access to drugs   
of the population will have access  now?                                 
to legalized drugs?                 Under &quot;legalization&quot; it would be     
                                    the same people who do it for        
                                    alcohol and tobacco.                 

Will they be limited only to        Are they limited to people over      
people over eighteen ?              eighteen now?                        
                                                                         
                                    Every major proposal for reform      
                                    assumes that minors should not have  
                                    access to drugs.  This is one of     
                                    the major reasons that many people   
                                    would like to see reform, because a  
                                    more sensible policy would do a      
                                    better job of keeping drugs away     
                                    from children.                       

Will cocaine, heroin, LSD and PCP   Are they available now?  As the DEA  
be made available if people         itself admits, their efforts have    
request them?                       never had any major effect on        
                                    availability of drugs and it is      
                                    unlikely that they ever will affect  
                                    the drug market.                     

Who will sell drugs? The            Who sells them now?                  
Government? Private companies ?     You can't think of anyone who could  
                                    do a better job than the current     
                                    sellers?                             

And who is liable for damages       The rules for liability should be    
caused by drug use and the          consistent for all drugs.  If you    
activities of those taking drugs?   get hit by a drunk or stoned         
                                    driver, it doesn't matter to you     
                                    which chemical caused the problem.   
                                    The damage is done in either case,   
                                    and should be addressed the same     
                                    under law.                           

Who will collect the revenues       Who collects them now?               
generated by the drug sales?        We have funded the richest criminal  
                                    organizations in the history of the  
                                    world with this policy. It is time   
                                    to take the money out of their       
                                    hands with a more sensible policy.   

How will a black market for         The same way it is controlled for    
cheaper drugs be controlled ?       alcohol and tobacco.                 

Who will bear the costs to society  Under the current system the         
of increased drug use?              taxpayers bear the entire cost, and  
                                    this system uses the single most     
                                    expensive, least cost-effective      
                                    approach to the problem -- prison.   
                                    For the same money it takes to       
                                    catch, try, and convict one drug     
                                    offender and to hold them in prison  
                                    for five years, we can provide       
                                    treatment or education for more      
                                    than one hundred people.  Which do   
                                    you think is the better deal?        

How will absenteeism and loss of    It should be addressed the same way  
productivity be  addressed by       it is for alcohol, tobacco, or any   
business?                           similar problem.                     

Will the local drug situation in a  Who dictates where drugs are sold    
community dictate which drugs are   now?                                 
sold where?                         The community itself should dictate  
                                    these matters, as they do with       
                                    liquor and tobacco outlets.          

How will society care for and pay   First, there is no real evidence     
for the attendant social costs of   that drug use would increase under   
increased drug use, including       a more sensible policy.              
family disintegration and child     Society is paying these costs        
neglect?                            already.  Reform would seek to       
                                    reduce those costs by using          
                                    approaches which are more            
                                    cost-effective than prison.  Prison  
                                    does not do anything to address      
                                    these problems.                      

Will people still need              This is a separate issue and,        
prescriptions for currently         whichever way it goes, will not      
controlled medications, such as     make much difference to the          
antibiotics, if drugs are           fundamental problems of our current  
legalized ?                         drug policy.  Antibiotics are an     
                                    entirely different class of drug     
                                    with an entirely different set of    
                                    uses and associated problems.        
                                    Therefore, it would be appropriate   
                                    to have a different policy for       
                                    them.                                

Will legal drugs require            That depends on what you mean by     
prescriptions?                      &quot;legal&quot;.  For example, both alcohol  
                                    and penicillin are &quot;legal&quot; but have  
                                    different requirements for           
                                    purchasing them.                     

Can anyone, regardless of physical  Who can purchase them now?           
or medical conditions purchase                                           
drugs?                              Can anyone, regardless of physical   
                                    or medical conditions purchase       
                                    alcohol or tobacco?  Alcohol and     
                                    tobacco are the big killers by a     
                                    wide margin. If we can manage to     
                                    find a workable policy for alcohol   
                                    and tobacco, then the other drugs    
                                    will be easy.                        

How can we deal with the influx of  We won't have to.  The rest of the   
people to the United States who     western world is going toward        
are seeking legal drugs?            &quot;legalization&quot; faster than we are.   

Can we begin a legalization pilot   Yes.  As the New York City Bar       
program in your neighborhood for    Association recommended, we should   
one year?                           allow states and communities to      
                                    determine their own approach to the  
                                    problem, as they do for alcohol, so  
                                    that we might have a number of       
                                    different programs from which to     
                                    draw ideas and information.  The     
                                    one thing we should not do is to     
                                    stay locked in to a single national  
                                    policy which -- by definition --     
                                    cannot work.                         

Should the distribution outlets be  Where are the distribution outlets   
located in the already              located now?                         
overburdened inner city?                                                 
                                    Matters affecting the inner city     
                                    should be decided by the people in   
                                    the inner city.

<p> The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs is
perhaps the best book ever written on the subject of drug policy.
The authors did five years of research in preparation to writing
it and the facts they found are absolutely fascinating,
regardless of what you may believe about drugs or drug policy. </p>

<p> If you have not read the full text, you should go to the
library immediately and read it. It is a fascinating book and is
certain to change many of your opinions. </p>

<p> This book is a copyrighted work and we have not yet obtained
permission to put it on the net. However, we will include a
chapter-by-chapter synopsis of the major points. We will also
post information where you can buy a copy of the full text. Read
this book! </p>

<h1>Fullerton Community College Speech </h1>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> <b>This is one of my typical speeches</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> First, I would like to inform everyone that the real subject
here today is not drug decriminalization, or legalization, or
re-legalization, or anything like that, because we still don't
know if we will ever do any of those things. What is certain is
that, at the current rates of incarceration, we will build the
largest prisons in the world. The issue is prison. It is not up
to us to justify decriminalization. It is up to those who support
the current policy to justify putting millions of people in
prison behind a drug policy which everyone admits cannot work. </p>

<p> One of the reasons that I am here is because of my mother. I
have heard many people say that the crusade against drugs is a
moral issue. William Bennett, our first national Drug Czar, said
that it is important to stamp out drugs because it is the moral
thing to do. I will show you that there is nothing moral about
it. </p>

<p> On April 20, 1992, my mother told me she wanted to die. She
called me that evening and asked me if I would understand if she
committed suicide. My mother is sixty-five years old and she
looks and acts at least ten years younger than her age. She still
works because she enjoys her job. Why then does she want to die? </p>

<p> A few years ago she had a minor operation on her ribs and,
during the operation, some nerves were damaged. It wasn't
anyone's fault, it is just one of the ordinary risks of surgery.
It could happen to anyone. Now the nerves fire constantly, at
near-maximum intensity. She says it feels as if someone is
holding a blowtorch to her ribs -- twenty-four hours a day. She
can no longer wear clothes which touch her skin. She can no
longer walk in a warm spring rain because the pain of a single
raindrop is too much to bear. Something as simple as a hug from
her smallest granddaughter will make her fall to the floor in
tears. </p>

<p> She has spent the last few years traveling across the United
States to find a cure. The doctors have tried a long list of
treatments including surgery, drugs, ointments, electricity, and
many other things. None of them worked very well and many of them
were dangerous. The best of them was a nerve block. The nerve
block required my mother to lay on her stomach while the doctors
injected anesthetic directly into the nerve causing the problem.
The needle had to be placed precisely on the nerve so it usually
had to be moved around for a few minutes to get just the right
spot. It reached the limits of human pain. The pain was so great
that her body rigidly locked up, with her senses overloaded. She
could not scream, breathe, or even see. </p>

<p> On two occasions they punctured her lung with this procedure,
and once they actually stopped her heart. To revive her, they
gave her CPR, which means they had to pound on her ribs. When she
awoke she screamed at them to kill her. She said that she was
bitter for months because they had not let her die when they had
the chance. She has since left written instructions that, if her
heart ever stops again, she is not to be revived. Still, she said
the nerve block is worth it, because it gives her relief for
almost three days and, besides, there is always the chance that
she will luck out and they will kill her again. </p>

<p> Only one treatment has ever worked to ease the pain. That
treatment is morphine. Morphine does not make her into a drug
addict. It does not make her into some kind of mindless zombie.
It does not even make her high. It just allows her to live a
relatively normal life, free from the pain in her side. When
compared with the other available treatments, morphine is the
cheapest, safest, and most effective treatment for her condition.
</p>

<p> He doctors will not give her morphine, for two reasons. The
first reason is that they are afraid she will become addicted. A
study conducted at Johns Hopkins Medical School showed that the
addiction rate for the medical use of morphine was less than
one-half of one percent. Even when patients do become addicted,
morphine addiction can be easily managed in a proper medical
environment, so addiction is not a legitimate medical concern. </p>

<p> The second reason they will not prescribe morphine is that
they are afraid of the drug police. They know that the Drug
Enforcement Administration and the local police can seize their
property and destroy their careers over a single questioned
prescription, and the police do not even have to file criminal
charges to do it. It not only can happen, it does happen. Last
year, the Drug Enforcement Administration sent two doctors to
prison for prescribing Tylenol 3. That is Tylenol with codeine.
Tylenol 3 is a prescription drug in only two countries in the
world, the United States and South Africa, and the United States
is the only country which has ever sent a doctor to prison for
prescribing this common medicine. There are many other cases
where doctors have had their lives and careers ruined over
equally trivial matters. </p>

<p> My mother has mixed emotions when I speak out about her
problem. She says that she really does not want anyone's sympathy
because, since she has had this problem, she has discovered that
there are so many more people who are in worse condition than she
is. Some people with AIDS get this same kind of condition all
over their bodies. Every day of their lives is worse than any
horror movie that you have ever seen. They can't get morphine
either. Seven thousand five hundred people go blind from glaucoma
every year because the best medicine - marijuana - is illegal.
And the list goes on. </p>

<p> There are literally millions of people with chronic pain,
cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, and other conditions for which the safest
and most effective medicine is a drug which is now illegal.
Hundreds of thousands of them violate the drug laws every day
because they need these medicines to live. </p>

<p> On behalf of all of the families affected by AIDS, and
cancer, and glaucoma, and a dozen other diseases, I am here to
tell you that this drug policy is indecent and it must be
stopped. There is nothing moral about a drug policy which makes
sick people choose between prison and death. </p>

<p> Drug policy is a complicated issue and we will not have time
today to resolve all of the points under discussion. In the past
fifty years, however, there have been several occasions when
major commissions have been formed specifically to study the
evidence and the options for drug policy and to make
recommendations. There have been both public and private
commissions, domestic and foreign, performed by people of all
political persuasions from liberals to conservative law-and-order
Republicans, and people who aren't even on our political map.
They all recommended decriminalization. </p>

<p> I would like to read to you some of the studies which have
reached this conclusion: </p>

<p> <u>The LaGuardia Committee Report,</u> commissioned by Mayor
Fiorello LaGuardia, written by the New York Academy of Medicine,
and published by the City of New York in 1944. </p>

<p> <u>The Baroness Wootton Report</u>, published by the
government of the United Kingdom in 1967. </p>

<p> <u>The Report of the Canadian Government Commission of
Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use of Drugs</u>, published by the
Canadian Government in 1969. </p>

<p> <u>Dealing With Drug Abuse: A Report to the Ford Foundation</u>,
published by the Drug Abuse Survey Project in 1972. </p>

<p> <u>The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs</u>,
published by the Editors of Consumer Reports Magazine in 1972.
This is a landmark study, a &quot;must-read&quot;, used as a
basic textbook at major universities. </p>

<p> <u>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and
Drug Abuse</u>, commissioned by President Nixon, and published by
the U.S. Federal Government in 1973. </p>

<p> <u>The Facts About Drug Abuse</u>, published by the United
States Drug Abuse Council in 1980. </p>

<p> <u>An Analysis of Marijuana Policy,</u> published by the
National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences in
1982. </p>

<p> <u>The Report of the California State Research Advisory Panel</u>,
commissioned by the State of California, and published in 1990. </p>

<p> The recommendations in these reports were endorsed by (among
others) the American Medical Association, the American Bar
Association, The American Association for Public Health, the
National Education Association, and the National Council of
Churches. </p>

<p> I might also add that the last two reports of the National
Commission on AIDS have also recommended that we adopt
non-criminal approaches to drug abuse. </p>

<p> We may debate the details of the many issues of drug policy
all day, but one basic fact is undeniable. When all of the issues
and all of the evidence is considered, the overwhelming weight of
the scholarly evidence on drug policy supports decriminalization.
</p>

<p> The first question that we need to ask ourselves is: How did
we get into this mess? Any study of the history of the drug laws
shows that they were based on two primary factors; racism and
ignorance. </p>

<p> You may have wondered why marijuana, heroin, and cocaine are
illegal while other equally dangerous drugs such as tobacco and
alcohol are legal, and even promoted by the Federal Government.
The primary reason is that alcohol and tobacco were associated
with white people while the other drugs were associated --
wrongly -- with people of color. </p>

<p> Opiates were first outlawed because of the fear that Chinese
men were luring white women to their ruin in opium dens. Ruin was
defined not as opium addiction, but as associating with Chinese
men. </p>

<p> In the early years of this century, many of the major
newspapers printed lurid articles about superhuman Negro Cocaine
Fiends who would take large amounts of cocaine which would cause
them to go on a violent sexual rampage and rape white women.
Police departments across the nation switched from .32 caliber
pistols to .38 caliber pistols because as one Police Chief
stated, &quot;Those cocaine niggers sure are hard to kill.&quot;
Newspaper stories of the day told lurid tales of Jewish peddlers
selling cocaine to poor southern blacks. There was also a
movement to ban caffeine for the same reasons. There was no
evidence to back up the myth of the Negro Cocaine Fiend simply
because most black people did not have the money to buy cocaine.
Any black man who did rape a white woman would have had to be
suicidal because in 1905 there were 105 recorded lynchings of
black men for unspecified offenses. </p>

<p> Marijuana was later outlawed largely as a repressive tool
against Mexican laborers who were competing with American workers
for jobs during the Depression. </p>

<p> Racism was one of the primary themes of the campaign against
drugs until the campaigns for civil rights in the 1950's and
1960's made it unacceptable. At that point, the drug warriors
turned to other myths to defend their cause. You have heard some
of those myths today. It is important to remember that many of
the myths you heard today were made up in the 1950's and 1960's
when it began to be apparent that the old myths just wouldn't cut
it any more. These laws never did have anything to do with public
health and safety. </p>

<p> GRAPH </p>

<p> We next need to understand the facts on the issue. My first
graph shows the number of deaths caused by drugs, both legal and
illegal, in the United States in a typical year. </p>

<p> Tobacco kills about 390,000 people. </p>

<p> Alcohol kills about 80,000. </p>

<p> Sidestream smoke from tobacco kills about 50,000 people who
don't even smoke. </p>

<p> Prescription drugs kill at least 10,000. </p>

<p> Cocaine kills about 2,500. </p>

<p> Heroin kills about 2,000. </p>

<p> Aspirin kills about 2,000 </p>

<p> Marijuana kills 0. Even the DEA itself says that there has
not been a recorded death due to marijuana in the history of the
United States. </p>

<p> All of the illegal drugs combined killed about 4,500, or
about one percent of the number killed by tobacco. Tobacco kills
more people every year than all of the people killed by all of
the illegal drugs in the Twentieth Century. More Colombians die
from the effects of American tobacco than the number of Americans
who die from Colombian cocaine. As you may know, tobacco is
heavily subsidized and promoted by the United States Government.
The US Government demands that other countries buy more American
tobacco even while we threaten them with war for sending us their
marijuana and cocaine. </p>

<p> Right now we have about 1.3 million people in prison. More
than 600,000 of them are there for non-violent drug offenses. For
every person who died from illegal drugs last year, one hundred
and fifty people went to prison. Most of them were black men. </p>

<p> You may hear a good deal of take about the dangers of illegal
drugs. First let me state that the medical evidence is very clear
that, by any standard of measurement, alcohol and tobacco are
substantially more dangerous to both the individual and to
society than any of the illegal drugs. We have known this for at
least twenty-five years. This is not to say that use of any drug
is entirely safe. We could safely assume that almost anything we
put into our bodies is going to have some health risk, to a
greater or lesser degree. That is not the issue. </p>

<p> Just because something is hazardous does not automatically
mean that the best approach to those hazards is to throw millions
of people in prison. In fact, every major study of drug policy
has concluded that prison only makes those hazards worse and
increases the damage done to society. As one commission stated,
the more we learn about the dangers of drugs, the more it will
become apparent that massive prisons are a medical and social
disaster. It is precisely because of those health hazards that we
must not send people to prison for drug offenses. </p>

<p> We might win the war on drugs if we could be successful in
one of three areas. </p>

<p> First, we could try to stop the production of drugs in
foreign countries. There is no credible evidence anywhere which
would suggest that we could stop, or even greatly reduce, the
production of drugs in foreign countries. The Federal
government's own evidence shows that this is impossible and it is
a waste of money to try. </p>

<p> Second, we could try to stop drugs at the border. There is no
credible evidence anywhere which would suggest that we could
stop, or even greatly reduce, the flow of drugs across our
border. The Federal government's own evidence shows that this is
impossible and it is a waste of money to try. </p>

<p> Third, we could try to stop the sale of drugs within the
United States, even while we know that it is impossible to stop
their production, or to keep them outof the United States. There
is no credible evidence anywhere which would suggest that we
could stop, or even greatly reduce, the sale of drugs within the
United States. Again, the evidence shows that this is impossible
and, not only is it a waste of money to try but, in fact, the war
against drugs actually causes far more harm than good. </p>

<p> The largest part of that harm falls upon the African-American
community. </p>

<p> GRAPH </p>

<p> I have here a few graphs which were taken directly from US
Federal Government statistics. The first graph shows the number
of people in prison over the last fifty years. The number of
people in prison was relatively stable for about fifty years,
until the 1970's when President Nixon started the first major
campaign against drugs. Then the number of inmates began to rise
sharply. It was also during the 1970's that a major recession hit
the country and African Americans, being at the bottom of the
economic totem pole, were the first to lose their jobs and the
last to be rehired when the economy changed. As a result of the
stresses on unemployed fathers, African-American families began
to fall apart and we saw the first great rise of black families
headed by single mothers. This became especially significant
because of what happened in the 1980s. </p>

<p> In the 1980s the rate of incarceration went through the roof.
Since 1980 we have tripled the number of people in prison and we
now have the largest prisons in the world. We will almost triple
their size again before the year 2000. </p>

<p> GRAPH </p>

<p> The next graph shows the racial breakdown of our prisons, and
projects those figures into the future, based on current trends.
By the year 2000, our prisons will be larger than the Nazi
concentration camps of World War II. About two-thirds of all of
the people in our prisons will be black men, most of them
arrested for non-violent drug offenses. For every black man who
goes to college, at least three will go to prison. Two-thirds of
all of today's black male teenagers will be dead, disabled, or in
prison before their thirtieth birthday. The largest single group
of them will go to prison for non-violent drug offenses. </p>

<p> Even as we speak, one-fourth of all of the young black men in
America are in prison, on probation, or on parole. In some inner
cities such as Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, which were test
cases for the war on drugs, more than half of all the young black
men in the city are under the supervision of the criminal justice
system. It is estimated that more than ninety percent of the
black men in these cities have already been incarcerated at least
once. </p>

<p> When an African-American man goes to prison he becomes
effectively permanently unemployable because nobody will hire a
black man with a prison record. Most of the young black men in
our nation's capitol are already economically dead as a direct
result of the war on drugs. </p>

<p> They become social pariahs, unwanted by employers and even by
the women in their own communities. They are unable to restore
themselves and the families that we will need to rebuild our
inner cities. The economic destruction of African-American men
caused by the war on drugs is perhaps the singlest biggest reason
that African-American families continued to disintegrate in the
1980's even in the midst of an economic boom. </p>

<p> Even conservative black leaders are now beginning to say that
the war on drugs is genocide and the new form of slavery and they
are right. Because of our misguided and ignorant drug policies,
we have already destroyed the better part of an entire generation
of African-American men. </p>

<p> In 1973 President Nixon's National Commission on Marihuana
and Drug Abuse said that the real drug problem is not heroin, or
cocaine, or marijuana. The real drug problem, they said, is the
ignorance of our public officials who have never bothered to read
the evidence. Today, we can prove that this is still true. </p>

<p> I would like my opponent to answer one simple question. I
have here a list of every major study of drug policy in the last
fifty years including the largest studies ever conducted by the
US Federal Government and the State of California. They all
recommended decriminalization. </p>

<p> Do you agree that the overwhelming weight of the scholarly
evidence on drug policy supports decriminalization? </p>

<p> Before you answer, remember that there are only three
possible answers to this question. </p>

<p> The first possible answer is yes, you agree that the
overwhelming weight of the scholarly evidence supports
decriminalization. </p>

<p> The second possible answer is no, you do not agree and,
therefore, you can provide a list of scholarly studies equal in
quality and quantity to the list I have provided. </p>

<p> The third possible answer is that you don't have a clue what
the scholarly evidence says because you have never read the most
basic research on the subject. </p>

<p> What is your answer? Do you agree that the overwhelming
weight of the scholarly evidence on drug policy supports
decriminalization? <br>

go from here? </p>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> The tide has turned in the war against the War on Drugs. It
is a tough fight, but those who support drug policy reform have
begun to carry the day. There have been three major television
specials on the issue in less than a year and the DEA openly
admitted their arguments were in trouble when they called a
special conference last August to try to find ways to argue
against reform. They have been getting pretty well shellacked in
every single debate over the last few years and the media has
begun to seriously question the wisdom of the drug war. The drug
warriors are in retreat and they know it. </p>

<p> The big question for those who support reform is: Where do we
go from here? Activists from around the world have been
discussing this on the Internet, and here are some of the
answers. </p>

<h2>The Internet </h2>

<p> Rapid communication is critical to this movement. Activists
from around the world have joined together on the Internet to
discuss ideas and provide support for each other in a wide
variety of ways. There are plans for a bigger and better presence
on the Internet where news, research, and ideas will be available
to anyone with a computer, and where people from around the world
can work together. We need more people on the Internet. We also
need someone in every city who is plugged in to the network and
can distribute the news on a timely basis to those who are not
yet on the Internet. </p>

<h2>Unity </h2>

<p> The Internet has also brought unity. The biggest single
thrust of the DEA in their public relations campaign is that we
lack unity. The DEA tells the public that those who support
reform don't even agree among themselves on what they want and,
therefore, they could never build a credible public policy. For
many years it was true. We have a number of organizations and
groups around the country who have always agreed on their
opposition to the drug war but have usually worked alone to
pursue their goals. As a result, we looked like a mob, rather
than a team. </p>

<p> Through the internet, we have held lengthy on-line
&quot;meetings&quot; where many of the leading activists and
organizations have discussed where we agreed and disagreed, and
how we could work together toward the goals we all shared. As the
result of those meetings, we have formulated a basic statement of
our objective and the principles which should be the basis for a
better drug policy. They are: </p>

<h2>Our Objective </h2>

<p> Our objective is to bring drugs within the law. </p>

<h2>Principles for a Solution. </h2>

<p> We believe that a better drug policy should be based on three
basic principles: </p>

<p> 1) Decisions on the medical use of drugs should be the sole
province of the medical profession in consultation with its
patients. </p>

<p> 2) Punishment should not be used to control private drug use.
</p>

<p> 3) We must have a consistent policy for all drugs of
potential abuse. </p>

<p> We ask all interested people and groups around the nation to
join us in a recognition of our common goals and present a united
front to the world. We all agree that we need reform now. The
first step toward reform is to press for open and honest
discussion of the issue. </p>

<h2>Better Public Relations </h2>

<p> When it comes to funding for media, we are clearly outgunned
by the drug warriors. But, over the last few years we have just
as clearly beaten them with a better, more sensible message. We
need a grass roots effort to educate the media at all levels.
Keep track of your local newspaper, television, and radio
stations and make sure that the old hysterical lies and
half-truths of the drug war do not go unchallenged. We have
proven that the media will come our way if they know the facts. </p>

<h2>Recruitment </h2>

<p> We all know people who are not members of the DPF but should
be. Many of them are not members simply because no one has asked
them to join, or they don't know the DPF is there. No one has
told them that their support is important. We should all make a
commitment to recruit at least one new member in the coming
month. It's easy. All you need to do is ask them. When you leave
the house tomorrow morning, carry a membership application and a
stamped envelope addressed to the DPF. I will bet you find a new
ally before noon. </p>

<h2>The Next Step </h2>

<p> We have already demonstrated that when the evidence is
examined the drug warriors don't have a leg to stand on. They
have lost every debate in the last few years because of the
evidence, so the last thing they want now is a public discussion
of the evidence. Their &quot;anti-legalization&quot; resolution
even says so, in so many words. Even the mere discussion of
possible alternatives, they say, will cause a massive increase in
drug addiction. </p>

<p> We want to talk about alternatives. We want to review the
evidence. We want openness, honesty, and objectivity in a public
review of all we know about drug policy. We want to lay the cards
on the table and let the chips fall where they may. The drug
warriors do not. Therein lies the difference between us. </p>

<p> Our mission is to draw the drug warriors into a public
debate. We must ask the media to ask them: &quot;What's wrong
with the truth? Why don't you want to read the evidence? Why
won't you discuss it? If you are right, the evidence will surely
show it.&quot; We have nothing to fear from the truth. <br>

<h1>An Analysis of DARE </h1>

<p>A series of articles about the Drug Abuse Resistance Education
program in schools </p>

<hr>

<h2>Links to Other DARE Pages</h2>

<p>The following two links are highly recommended for additional
information on DARE. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.dare.org/"><font size="5">The Other Side
of DARE</font></a> <br>
</p>

<h2>Does DARE work? </h2>

<p><b>No.</b> All the major research on the effectiveness of DARE
shows that it has no impact on the rate of drug use by children
who go through DARE training. These reports include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>1991 Kentucky study - National Institute on Drug Abuse -
        &quot;No statistically significant differences&quot; </li>
    <li>1990 Canadian Government study &quot;DARE had no
        significant effect on the use of...marijuana, acid,
        heroin, crack, glue and PCP&quot; </li>
    <li>1993 Research Triangle Institute - National Institute of
        Justice - Statistical analysis of all DARE research,
        which says DARE has &quot;a limited to essentially
        non-existent effect&quot; on drug use. </li>
    <li>The final edition of the largest evaluation of the DARE
        program has concluded that the Anti-Drug program does not
        reduce drug use, and in at least category of pot, the
        DARE graduates smoked more frequently than the control.
        The report concluded: &quot;The DARE program's limited
        effect on adolescent drug use contrasts with the
        program's popularity and prevalence. An important
        implication is that DARE could be taking the place of
        other, more beneficial drug education programs that kids
        could be receiving&quot;How Effective is DARE, American
        Journal of Public Health Sept 1994 p1399 </li>
</ul>

<p>Among the notable quotations from researchers: * &quot;Its
well established that DARE doesn't work&quot; Gilbert Botvin -
Cornell Medical Center * &quot;Research shows that, no, DARE
hasn't been effective in reducing drug use&quot; William
Modzeleski, Top Drug education official at the Department of
Education </p>

<p>* &quot;I think the program should be entirely scrapped and
redeveloped anew.&quot; Dr. William Hansen, who helped design the
original DARE </p>

<p>And the DARE defenders - </p>

<ul>
    <li>Glenn Levant, executive director of DARE, called studies
        flawed, and suggested that we need to study the problem
        for the next seven years. He then said &quot;We're like
        apple pie&quot;. </li>
    <li>&quot;..surveys across the nation show kids who take the
        DARE course are much less likely to use drugs&quot;. Mike
        Muiller, police officer and DARE instructor, who may have
        unwittingly shown why DARE is failing. </li>
    <li>Michael Milken, famous junk bond king found guilty of
        securities fraud, was among the &quot;noted&quot;
        volunteers who show young kids how to live. </li>

<h2>Pot (Drugs) are Dangerous - How to Deal with the Argument </h2>

<p> <strong>by Clifford A. Schaffer</strong> </p>

<p> You have heard the argument before: </p>

<p> <strong>Pot is dangerous. It causes cancer, auto accidents,
grows hair on your palms, and makes you go blind.</strong> </p>

<p> This is a guide on how to deal with this argument in all
sorts of easy ways. Some of these arguments were developed during
debates with doctors, so some of them assume that the opponent is
a doctor. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">General
Discussion </h3>

<p> First, it is generally pointless to get tied up in debating
the details of health issues or, in general, any supposed danger
of drugs. The reason is that you get so wound up in trading
scientific references that you never get to the real bottom line
-- prison. Dr. So-and-So (who the audience doesn't know anyway)
says X, Dr. Whositt, says Y -- so what? </p>

<p> Net result -- you convince nobody. Once you have won your
main point, and established that criminal punishment is not an
effective approach to the problem -- no matter what you have
assumed about the dangers -- then you can go back and, at your
leisure, knock down their health evidence as well. </p>

<p> My approach -- conceding all their evidence up front -- does
a complete end run. They expect me to argue that pot doesn't
cause cancer, etc. When I don't, and jump to the bottom line
policy issue (prison), they are completely disarmed. They really
don't know what to do. They never thought about their logical
non-sequitir (Because XXXXX is dangerous, therefore prison is the
solution) and are completely unprepared to deal with arguments
which address the logical disconnect. Once they are sitting there
with a stunned expression on their face -- knowing they have been
completely cut off -- then I come back with the mop up campaign
of addressing the health risks and comparing them with other
health risks for which we do not put people in jail. By that
time, they will be doing little but nodding their head and
agreeing. </p>

<p> I remember one debate in which my opponent showed up with a
whole stack of medical references on the harmful effects of
drugs. A few minutes into the debate he closed his folder and
never opened it again. Of course, as always, he conceded and
agreed with me. </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">The
Specific Responses </h3>

<p> Now for the specific responses: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Ok, you convinced me. Let's assume everything you say is
        true and it grows hair on your palms besides. How many
        millions of people do you suppose we ought to throw in
        prison for best results? </li>
    <li>Let's assume all the evidence you presented is 100
        percent accurate. The evidence you presented shows that
        pot is perhaps three times as carcinogenic as cigarettes.
        What does this mean in terms of policy? Does it mean that
        the penalties for pot should be three times the penalties
        for cigarettes? Then, of course, there should be even
        higher penalties for cigars and chewing tobacco, right? </li>
    <li>So the argument is XXXXXX causes cancer. Therefore, the
        law is really based on trying to prevent people from
        doing things which might give them cancer, right? Should
        we have laws against staying out in the sun too long,
        eating cheeseburgers, or smoking tobacco? </li>
    <li>The reasons you have stated never did have anything to do
        with why the laws were passed in the first place. Please
        answer two questions: Why were the drug laws passed in
        the first place? When did the concerns over cancer become
        the reason behind the laws? </li>
    <li>If your concern is really the carcinogens, then we can
        just require that the active ingredient be distributed in
        its pure form. Or what if someone only uses it by
        distilling the active ingredient (a simple process) and
        thereby takes no carcinogens? Shouldn't they be free from
        penalties? </li>
    <li>Gosh, you convinced me. Let's solve the problem right
        away. We will elect you King so you can do _anything_ you
        want. And ... every pot smoker in America is lined up
        outside your door with a bag of dope in one hand and a
        signed confession in the other. Now what? </li>
    <li>Every major study of drug policy agreed that prohibition
        only multiplied the bad effects which already exist with
        drugs. For example, overdoses become more likely because
        users don't know what they are getting; there are no
        standards for drug purity so there is greater harm from
        contaminants, addicts are less likely to receive
        effective treatment, etc. The more you assume about the
        harmful effects of drugs, the more imperative it becomes
        to address them in a non-criminal manner. </li>
    <li>Your evidence states that pot may be a problem while
        driving. Let's assume (for the sake of argument) that
        this is true. Do we attempt to solve the problem of drunk
        driving by throwing wine and beer drinkers in jail? Why
        not? (Can you say &quot;misapplication of
        resources&quot;?) </li>
    <li>The argument that pot was found in the bloodstreams of
        any group of people who died from any cause is not
        indicative of anything other than that they might have
        used pot some time within the last two months before they
        died. It does not say anything about all the people who
        may have pot in their bloodstreams and still be alive and
        well. It doesn't even say anything about _why_ they died.
        For comparison purposes, as any competent doctor knows,
        we need control groups. </li>
    <li>We must be wary of false comparisons (as any competent
        doctor should know). For example, we had one previous
        example in which large numbers of people were dying with
        pot in their bloodstreams. It was called Vietnam. Pot
        smokers had a high death rate, but it had nothing to do
        with pot. </li>
    <li>Pot causes cancer. Therefore, the best approach to the
        problem is to put millions of people in prison. This is
        the basic argument. Can you say &quot;non-sequitir&quot;?
        Where did you get the idea that if something is a health
        hazard, we ought to throw people in prison? </li>
    <li>Name all the other health problems for which prison is
        the recommended treatment. </li>
    <li>Please make a list of the comparable health problems
        caused by say, alcohol, and then match the health
        problems with the appropriate criminal penalties. </li>
    <li>Then maybe you can tell me why every major study of drug
        policy in the last fifty years recommended
        decriminalization. (See the list of Biggest Studies of
        Drug Policy on my web page.) </li>
    <li>You know, we can dispense with all the details and cut to
        the bottom line. Rather than argue the details of what it
        <strong>_might_</strong> cause, we can take a look at the
        actual stats on what it <strong>_does_</strong> cause.
        When we look at the official stats, such as deaths from
        any pot-related cause, the numbers are trivial in
        comparison with the damage done by alcohol and tobacco.
        We are spending 99 percent of our budget on one percent
        of the real drug problems. </li>
</ol>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">If Your
Opponent is a Doctor </h3>

<p> 16) Hey, Doc! What is the first rule of addressing a health
problem? First, do no harm. Right? Putting people in prison does
significant harm long before they are likely to get cancer. </p>

<p> If my opponent is a doctor I will hammer him on points just
like the one above. If he is really concerned about pot as a
health issue then, by God, he ought to be ready to address that
part of the problem as he would any other health issue. Would he
put people in prison for non-marital sex in order to prevent
venereal disease? Obviously he wouldn't. Hit him with his own
values and evidence. </p>

<p> And, if he is a doctor, I would hammer him repeatedly on the
fact that he really didn't know anything about the subject. Like:
</p>

<p> So tell me why the Consumers Union Report on Licit and
Illicit Drugs said that prohibition was the worst thing we could
do for drug-related health problems. You haven't read it have
you? The big problem here is ignorance, Doctor. It is one thing
to read some medical literature about the harm these things can
do and it is quite another to make the leap to an effective
public policy. Your problem, Doctor, is that you have read some
of the medical evidence but haven't read the evidence on drug
policy. Ignorance is a shameful thing in someone with as much
education as you have. </p>

<p> In short, if I am in a debate with a doctor, he will fall
before I am done -- because he is a doctor. I will goad him into
reading the CU Report by taunting him, calling him ignorant,
cajoling him, or anything else I have to do. I will force him to
either read what I have read or look like a public fool. Once
they read it, they always concede. For example, see my much
earlier post &quot;Cliff Converts Doc&quot;. It was written by a
doctor who fought me tooth and nail and then wound up telling
everyone that I was right. Excerpts of my debate with him are
posted on my web page. <br>

<h2>CLAIM X: DRUG LEGALIZATION WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON
LOWINCOME COMMUNITIES </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some proponents of legalization claim that current strict drug
control policies have a disproportionately adverse effect on poor
communities. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This much is obvious from even the most cursory examination of
the statistics. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The drug laws of the United States, and efforts to stop drug
trafficking and abuse, are designed to protect all people from
the harm and denigration that illegal drugs cause. If one
economic group or another is disproportionately affected by the
implementation of current laws, that problem should be dealt with
in its proper context--not by legalizing drugs. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the laws were based largely on racism and
the fears of such things as Chinese men luring white women to
their ruin in opium dens, and the mythical &quot;Negro Cocaine
Fiend.&quot; Harry Anslinger specifically stated that the primary
reason to outlaw marijuana (hemp) was &quot;its effect on the
degenerate races.&quot; </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The participants at the Forum, many of them city police
chiefs, disagreed with the notion that legalization would improve
the lot of the poor. </p>

<p>Legalization proponents argue that fewer people would be
arrested for drug trafficking crime and the violence associated
with turf protection would be reduced if drugs were legalized.
That argument assumes that drugrelated violence is limited to
rival drug gangs disputing turf, when in fact, most drug violence
is committed by people under the influence of drugs. </p>

<p>The incidence of dysfunctional families, unemployability,
family violence, and ruined lives would increase in lowincome
communities, just as they would in every other community. All
communities would see increased aberrant behavior because of
increased drug use; increased occurrences of child neglect;
increased family disintegration; increased fetal damage caused by
mothers' drug use; increased social welfare costs; loss of
workforce productivity; increased auto accidents because drivers
are driving under the influence of drugs; increased industrial
accidents caused by impaired workers; increased absenteeism; and
increases in emergency room visits and overdose deaths. In short,
all Americans would see a moral decline of society. </p>

<p>Drug use in the inner city is a manifestation of other
problems in the inner city; these problems would not go away if
more drugs were available. If proponents truly believe that
legalization would have a positive affect on communities, we
challenge them to set up a trial program in their own community. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is an empty challenge. If anyone tried it, the DEA would
have them in jail before the first results could be evaluated.
This kind of trial program is the last thing the DEA wants to
see, as they have already stated by their opposition to an
objective Federal Commission to examine the evidence. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> In his 1994 article in the New England Journal of Medicine,
Dr. Herbert Kleber addresses the drug situation: &quot;Our
current drug situation follows a pattern of earlier drug
epidemics. As the use of drugs drops from epidemic to endemic
levels, disadvantaged groups are more likely than others to
continue using drugs because of their greater availability and
fewer alternative opportunities. That is why minority communities
want not only treatment facilities but also fair laws, justly
applied to reduce the horrendous toll of drug related crime in
their neighborhoods. The illegal, open air drug bazaars that
flourish in southeastern Washington DC and the South Bronx would
not be tolerated in Georgetown or Scarsdale.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Try as I might, I can't find anything in that statement which
says that throwing massive numbers of people in prison for drug
offenses is a good idea. <br>

   <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">George McMahon</A> sat down on the steps of the Capitol building in Des 
Moines Saturday, leaned back, fired up a marijuana cigarette and casually 
inhaled -- and he wasn't breaking any laws.
   <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>, who suffers from a rare genetic defect that causes muscle spasms
and nausea, is one of eight people in the United States authorized by the 
federal government to use the drug legally.
   "My hospital bills used to be thousands of dollars.  Now I smoke a 
plant," <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>, of Bode, told more than 30 people gathered Saturday for a 
rally in support of legalizing the drug for medical purposes.  "I smoke 
marijuana because it makes me better.  The other pills I took made me 
worse."
   Most who attended the rally, including <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>, agreed that both 
corporate and government interests have prevented the drug's wide-spread 
legal use.
   "They're fighting dirty, like in the 1930s when they said marijuana will 
make you mean," <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> said.  "They're using weapons against you that you 
don't understand."
   Barbara Douglass of Storm Lake, another person who may use marijuana 
legally, also attended the rally.  Douglass suffers from multiple sclerosis.
   Carl Olsen of the group Iowans for Medical MarUuana, which sponsored the 
rally, said he remains optimistic about favorable legislation becoming law.
   "The legislators aren't afraid they won't get elected for supporting this 
issue," he said.  "The public supports this issue."
   Iowa Sen. Merlin Bartz, R-Grafton, who did not attend the rally but has 
agreed to draft legislation supporting the legal medical use of marijuana, 
said judgments about the drug's proper use should be left to the medical 
community.
   "There are all other types of prescription drugs that are considered 
illegal if not used under the direction of a doctor," Bartz said, "and for 
some reason (marijuana) has been singled out as something that cannot be 
legally prescribed by a doctor.
   "In no way is that an endorsement of legalizing the drug," he added.
   Not all Iowa lawmakers agree.
   Rep. Philip Wise, D-Keokuk, who teaches high school, did not attend the 
rally Saturday but said he would oppose such legislation.
   "Having dealt with teens for the last 26 years, the last thing we need to 
do at this juncture is send the message that the use of any drugs, including 
softer drugs, is acceptable," he said.</PRE>

<p> --in response to &quot;It's Drugs Stupid&quot;---Hey,
&quot;It's Prohibition Stupid.&quot; </p>

<p> Legalize it, Don't Criticize it. </p>

<p> Drug Prohibition is the Problem Not the Solution </p>

<p> I read once that if you take a black sharpie and black-out

<p> on the DARE bumper stickers, it reads, </p>

<p> &quot;DARE to keep drugs&quot; </p>

<p>LIBERTY ACTIVISTS' LIST </p>

<p> v 1.36 06/1995 </p>

<p> So you're sick of the &quot;War on Drugs&quot;? Here's an
international list of over 200 organizations which support drug
law reform, although most of them are in the US. Look for one in
your area. Please distribute this list widely, and send in any
groups which are not listed already. There's an active group here
for almost any taste. Joining your favorite organization is best,
though if you're worried about persecution, just send anonymous
money or a letter of appreciation. Take advantage of your
democratic rights while you still have some! </p>

<p> If you're already in a law reform organisation, you can use
this list to contact others with similar interests, and share
information or facilities. Just knowing that there are others
working on these issues can be a big morale booster. </p>

<p> The power of pro-liberty organisations can be multiplied many
times by fast and efficient communication, which spreads news and
promotes co-ordinated action. Electronic mail and conferencing is
the most efficient way to achieve these necessary abilities. For
example, this list doubled its size in eight months of
circulation over the Internet. I strongly encourage active groups
and individuals to use this powerful technology. </p>

<p> This listing was originally kicked off with a list of groups
reproduced with permission from the February, 1992 issue of High
Times magazine (contact details at the end of the list). </p>

<p> Since then, it has grown considerably through the kindness of
those who have contributed additional entries, including Chris
Klausmeier, Macca Macpherson, Dave Thomson and Keith Lim. </p>

<p> Please reproduce and distribute widely with this
acknowledgment. Post it on bulletin boards if you can. </p>

<p> PLEASE SEND NEW LISTINGS </p>

<p> I don't know any more about most of these groups, than what
appears here. If you know about other active groups not listed
here, or if any entries need correction, please e-mail me at
schaffer@smartlink.net, or mail to the address below, for
incorporation in future editions of this list. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM">Political
Strategies </p>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> This is a first crack at the kinds of political strategies we
must use to end the drug war. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
win by knockout. </h2>

<p> I believe that we must pick issues where we can by knockout.
The odds are so stacked against us that, unless we win by
knockout, we will not win at all. </p>

<p> While I agree with the economics and civil liberties
arguments for decriminalization, I do not favor the use of these
issues as a primary focus. The primary reason that I do not like
the arguments on economics or civil liberties is because they are
highly intellectual arguments which could be debated all day with
no clear resolution. They make people think too much, and that
slows down decision-making. We want issues which will change
people's minds forever -- and do it today. I believe that these
arguments may be useful to convince other people like us, but it
will not convince large masses of Americans. </p>

<p> There are two primary issues where I believe we can win by
knockout right now. They are the treatment of medical patients,
and the issue of African-American men. In both cases we have
clear, overwhelming arguments which would get the immediate
agreement of large masses of Americans. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
build a coalition of constituencies. </h2>

<p> We must bring people of different persuasions together to
support our cause. In our Resolution, we have already chosen a
broadly based statement which does not use the &quot;D&quot; word
and which could be supported by people of all persuasions. That
is step one. </p>

<p> Next we, need to formally identify our constituencies and the
specific arguments which will be most relevant to those groups. </p>

<p> Some constituencies are: </p>

<p> Doctors - The relevant issues here are the persecution of
doctors and the treatment of medical patients. </p>

<p> Medical Patient Groups - The relevant issue is the treatment
of medical patients. </p>

<p> African-Americans - The relevant issue is the incarceration
and economic destruction of African-American men. </p>

<p> I believe that doctors and African-Americans are absolutely
vital to our success and that every one of us should take
immediate steps to recruit them to our cause. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
form &quot;intervention groups&quot; and target specific
individuals that we need on our side. </h2>

<p> We have used an approach which someone likened to an Alcohols
Anonymous intervention group. We assembled a group of people that
we knew an important person would find persuasive. Then we all
went together to that person and explained our concerns in terms
that were important to that person. Then we asked for support,
not for the &quot;D&quot; word, but for general drug policy
reform. </p>

<p> This technique is highly effective and will enable us to
change the thinking of many important people, or at least start
them down the slippery slope to the &quot;D&quot; word. I believe
that we should all commit to participating in at least one of
these intervention groups to change the mind of at least one
important person. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
seek action. </h2>

<p> We have already asked for public hearings. As many of you
have already stated, public hearings may not come about and, even
if they do, they may not change anything. Therefore, we must seek
other means which will also bring about clear public
confrontations on the issue. When those confrontations occur, we
must all respond unanimously. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
provide support for people who speak out for drug policy reform. </h2>

<p> We all know that many people are reluctant to speak out for
reform because of the McCarthy-like tactics of our opposition. We
must come to the defense of anyone who is criticized or vilified
because of their support for a change in drug policy. Point out
that people are not vilified because they are Republican,
Democrat, or Libertarian, but people are vilified if they even
want to discuss a different drug policy. This is McCarthyism. <br>

<h1>A Short History of the Drug Laws </h1>

<p> <b>by the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug
Information </b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> ------begin quote------- </p>

<p> The history of nonmedical drug use, and the development of
policies in response to drug use, also extends back to the early
settlement of the country. Like alcohol, the classification of
certain drugs as legal, or illegal, has changed over time. These
changes sometimes had racial and class overtones. </p>

<p> According to Mosher and Yanagisako, for example, Prohibition
was in part a response to the drinking practices of European
immigrants, who became the new lower class. Cocaine and opium
were legal during the 19th century, and were favored drugs among
the middle and upper classes. Cocaine became illegal after it
became associated with African Americans following
Reconstruction. Opium was first restricted in California in 1875
when it became associated with Chinese immigrant workers.
Marijuana was legal until the 1930s when it became associated
with Mexicans. LSD, legal in the 1950s, became illegal in 1967
when it became associated with the counterculture. </p>

<p> Historical Overview of Prevention </p>

<p> Alcoholic beverages have been a part of the Nation's past
since the landing of the Pilgrims. According to Alcohol and
Public Policy: Beyond the Shadow of Prohibition, a publication
commissioned by NIAAA and prepared by the National Academy of
Sciences, the colonists brought with them from Europe a high
regard for alcoholic beverages, which were considered an
important part of their diet. Drinking was pervasive because
alcohol was regarded primarily as a healthy substance with
preventive and curative powers, not as an intoxicant. Alcohol was
also believed to be conducive to social as well as personal
health. It played an essential role in rituals of conviviality
and collective activity, such as barn raisings. While drunkenness
was condemned and punished, it was viewed only as an abuse of a
God-given gift. </p>

<p> The first temperance movement began in the early 1800s in
response to dramatic increases in production and consumption of
alcoholic beverages, which also coincided with rapid demographic
changes. Agitation against ardent spirits and the public disorder
they spawned gradually increased during the 1820s. In addition,
inspired by the writings of Benjamin Rush, the concept that
alcohol was addicting, and that this addiction was capable of
corrupting the mind and the body, took hold. The American Society
of Temperance, created in 1826 by clergymen, spread the
anti-drinking gospel. By 1835, out of a total population of 13
million citizens, 1.5 million had taken the pledge to refrain
from distilled spirits. The first wave of the temperance movement
(1825 to 1855) resulted in dramatic reductions in the consumption
of distilled spirits, although beer drinking increased sharply
after 1850. </p>

<p> The second wave of the temperance movement occurred in the
late 1800s with the emergence of the Women's Christian Temperance
Movement, which, unlike the first wave, embraced the concept of
prohibition. It was marked both by the recruitment of women into
the movement and the mobilization of crusades to close down
saloons. The movement set out to remove the destructive
substance, and the industries that promoted its use, from the
country. The movement held that while some drinkers may escape
problems of alcohol use, even moderate drinkers flirted with
danger. </p>

<p> The culmination of this second wave was the passage of the
18th Amendment and the Volstead Act, which took effect in 1920.
While Prohibition was successful in reducing per capita
consumption and some problems related to drinking, its social
turmoil resulted in its repeal in 1933. </p>

<p> Since the repeal of Prohibition, the dominant view of alcohol
problems has been that alcoholism is the principal problem. With
its focus on treatment, the rise of the alcoholism movement
depoliticized alcohol problems as the object of attention, as the
alcoholic was considered a deviant from the predominant styles of
life of either abstinence or &quot;normal&quot; drinking. The
alcoholism movement is based on the belief that chronic or
addictive drinking is limited to a few, highly susceptible
individuals suffering from the disease of alcoholism. The disease
concept of alcoholism focuses on individual vulnerability, be it
genetic, biochemical, psychological, or social/cultural in
nature. Under this view if the collective problems of each
alcoholic are solved, it follows that society's alcohol problem
will be solved. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, the pre-Prohibition view of alcohol as a
special commodity has persisted in American society and is an
accepted legacy of alcohol control policies. Following Repeal,
all States restricted the sale of alcoholic beverages in one way
or another in order to prevent or reduce certain alcohol
problems. In general, however, alcohol control policies
disappeared from the public agenda as both the alcoholism
movement and the alcoholic beverage industry embraced the view,
&quot;the fault is in the man and not in the bottle.&quot; </p>

<p> This view of alcoholism problems has also been the dominant
force in contemporary alcohol problem prevention. Until recently
the principal prevention strategies focused on education and
early treatment. Within this view education is intended to inform
society about the disease and to teach people about the early
warning signs so that they can initiate treatment as soon as
possible. Efforts focus on &quot;high risk&quot; populations and
attempt to correct a suspect process or flaw in the individual,
such as low self esteem or lack of social skills. The belief is
that the success of education and treatment efforts in solving
each alcoholic's problem will solve society's alcohol problem as
well. </p>

<p> Contemporary alcohol problem prevention began in the 1970s as
new information on the nature, magnitude, and incidence of
alcohol problems raised public awareness that alcohol can be
problematic when used by any drinker, depending upon the
situation. There was a renewed emphasis on the diverse
consequences of alcohol use--particularly trauma associated with
drinking driving, fires, and violence, as well as long term
health consequences. </p>

<p> The history of nonmedical drug use, and the development of
policies in response to drug use, also extends back to the early
settlement of the country. Like alcohol, the classification of
certain drugs as legal, or illegal, has changed over time. These
changes sometimes had racial and class overtones. According to
Mosher and Yanagisako, for example, Prohibition was in part a
response to the drinking practices of European immigrants, who
became the new lower class. Cocaine and opium were legal during
the 19th century, and were favored drugs among the middle and
upper classes. Cocaine became illegal after it became associated
with African Americans following Reconstruction. Opium was first
restricted in California in 1875 when it became associated with
Chinese immigrant workers. Marijuana was legal until the 1930s
when it became associated with Mexicans. LSD, legal in the 1950s,
became illegal in 1967 when it became associated with the
counterculture. </p>

<p> By the end of the 19th century concern had grown over the
indiscriminate use of these drugs, especially the addicting
patent medicines. Cocaine, opium, and morphine were common
ingredients in various potions sold over the counter. Until 1903,
cocaine was an ingredient of Coca-Cola(R). Heroin, which was
isolated in 1868, was hailed as a nonaddicting treatment for
morphine addiction and alcoholism. States began to enact control
and prescription laws and, in 1906, Congress passed the Pure Food
and Drug Act. It was designed to control opiate addiction by
requiring labels on the amount of drugs contained in products,
including opium, morphine, and heroin. It also required accurate
labeling of products containing alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. </p>

<p> The Harrison Act (1914) imposed a system of taxes on opium
and coca products with registration and record-keeping
requirements in an effort to control their sale or distribution.
However, it did not prohibit the legal supply of certain drugs,
especially opiates. </p>

<p> Current drug laws are rooted in the 1970 Controlled
Substances Act. Under this measure drugs are classified according
to their medical use, their potential for abuse, and their
likelihood of producing dependence. The Act contains provisions
for adding drugs to the schedule, and rescheduling drugs. It also
establishes maximum penalties for the criminal manufacture or
distribution of scheduled drugs. </p>

<p> Increases in per capita alcohol consumption as well as
increased use of illegal drugs during the 1960s raised public
concern regarding alcohol and other drug problems. Prevention
issues gained prominence on the national level with the creation
of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)
in 1971 and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) in 1974.
In addition to mandates for research and the management of
national programs for treatment, both Institutes included
prevention components. </p>

<p> To further prevention initiatives at the Federal level, the
Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 created the U.S. Office for Substance
Abuse Prevention (OSAP), which consolidated alcohol and other
drug prevention activities under the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and
Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA). The ADAMHA block grant
mandate called for States to set aside 21 percent of the alcohol
and drug funds for prevention. In a 1992 reorganization, OSAP was
changed to the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP), part
of the new SAMHSA, retaining its major program areas, while the
research institutes of NIAAA and NIDA transferred to NIH. </p>

<p> The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) was
established by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. Its primary
objective was to develop a drug control policy that included
roles for the public and private sector to &quot;restore order
and security to American neighborhoods, to dismantle drug
trafficking organizations, to help people break the habit of drug
use, and to prevent those who have never used illegal drugs from
starting.&quot; In early 1992 underage alcohol use was included
among the drugs to be addressed by ONDCP. </p>

<p> While Federal, State, and local governments play a
substantial role in promoting prevention agendas, much of the
activity takes place at grass roots community levels. In addition
to funding from CSAP's &quot;Community Partnerships&quot; grant
program, groups receive support from private sources, such as The
Robert Wood Johnson &quot;Fighting Back&quot; program. </p>

<p> While alcohol and other drug problems continue to plague the
Nation at intolerably high levels, progress is being made.
National surveys document a decline in illicit drug use and a
leveling off of alcohol consumption. And indicators of problem
levels, such as alcohol-involved traffic crashes, show
significant declines. </p>

<h1>A WISER COURSE: ENDING DRUG PROHIBITION </h1>

<h2>I. INTRODUCTION </h2>

<p>In 1986, the Association of the Bar of the City of New York,
responding to a general perception that criminal and civil </p>

<p>sanctions against the manufacture, distribution, or possession
of drugs were not &quot;solving,&quot; or even ameliorating, the
problems associated with drug use in our society, formed a
Special Committee on Drugs and the Law (the
&quot;Committee&quot;) to study our current drug laws and to
report its recommendations on the wisdom of such laws. </p>

<p>The Committee has considered the complex legal, social,
medical, economic, and political issues raised by our nation's
current drug control policies. Despite billions of dollars spent
on law enforcement, criminal prosecution, and incarceration
during the past 80 years, the United States has made little or no
progress toward reducing drug use or solving its &quot;drug
problem.&quot; On the contrary, illegal drug use remains a
pervasive and powerful influence in our cities and in the nation
at large. Beyond the continuing availability and consumption of
drugs, the unintended consequences of our current prohibition
policy are ubiquitous: our courts, both state and federal, are
jammed; our prison populations are burgeoning; urban and ghetto
children, as well as adults, are frequent victims of violent
&quot;turf wars&quot;; our civil liberties are being eroded,
along with our society's respect for the rule of law generally;
our public health is threatened; the enjoyment of urban life has
declined; and our nation's institutions, as well as those of our
South and Central American neighbors, are undermined by the
immense wealth accumulated illegally under the current
prohibition policies. </p>

<p>The Committee has concluded, in some cases reluctantly, that
the costs of drug prohibition are simply too high and its
benefits too dubious. </p>

<p>The Committee recognizes that calling for an end to drug
prohibition cannot be either the end of our inquiry or the sum of
our recommendations. There are several difficult questions that
remain to be answered: What forms of governmental regulation, if
any, are appropriate instead of prohibition? To what degree, if
any, should private distribution of drugs be permitted? Is a
regulatory regime similar to one now used to control alcoholic
beverages appropriate for some, if not all, drugs? How should a
new regulatory regime treat children, adolescents, or pregnant
women? What kinds of prevention and treatment programs should
there be and how should they be funded? </p>

<p>These and other issues demand both the urgent attention and
honest judgment of our Committee and, more broadly, our society. </p>

<p>The Committee believes the necessary inquiry cannot begin in
earnest so long as our nation remains committed to the illusion
that drug use can be prohibited at an acceptable cost. Only by
recognizing that this is no longer true can we fashion a method
of controlling drugs other than the current coercive drug laws,
which have been largely ineffective and which are sapping the
vitality of our cities, our legal system, and our society as a
whole. It is the Committee's hope that this report will advance
the discussion of this important issue. </p>

<h2>II. THE COSTS OF PROHIBITION </h2>

<h3>A. DISTORTION OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM </h3>

<p>At a time of ever-increasing competition for scarce public
funds, the volume of drug prosecutions and convictions continues
to increase, as does the strain on judicial budgets, personnel,
and facilities in the federal and state systems. The added
burdens on the judiciary due to drug prosecutions have
substantially diminished the courts' capacity to manage the civil
docket. Criminal cases take priority, with civil jury trials
relegated to the bottom of an increasing waiting list. Some
courts, for purely budgetary reasons, have been forced to suspend
all civil jury trials for periods of time. </p>

<h4>1. New York State </h4>

<p>The majority of drug cases are handled by state and local
courts. Consequently, it is instructive to review first the
impact of these increased caseloads and costs on New York State. </p>

<p>In 1991, New York State spent a total of $8,641,418,000 for
all judicial and legal services (including police protection,
$3,662,389,000; courts, $932,314,000; prosecution and legal
services, $461,790,000; and public defense, 197,194,000). It is
difficult to obtain specific dollar figures for the cost of drug
arrests and prosecutions in New York State, but by combining the
available data on caseloads and judicial costs it is possible to
make some rough estimates. In 1987, total arrests in New York
State were 481,676, whereas in 1991 the total was 506,710, an
increase of 5.2%. During the same period, felony drug arrests
rose from 42,655 (approximately 9% of total arrests) in 1987 to
54,184 in 1991 (11% of all arrests), a 27% increase. By contrast,
between 1987 and 1991, misdemeanor drug arrests dropped from
53,621 to 36,489, a decrease of 32%. In 1991 a tremendous volume
of caseload activity confronted the Judiciary's judges and
nonjudicial personnel. Nearly 79,000 felony indictments and
superior court informations were filed in Supreme and County
Courts throughout New York. That number represents a 54% increase
compared with 1985. Most of the statewide increase was the result
of phenomenal caseload increases in New York City. This year, the
Supreme Court Criminal Term in New York City received over 52,000
felony filings, an astonishing 70% increase since 1985. The
remarkable level in felony filings is primarily caused by
increases in drug-related filings. </p>

<p>. . . Unquestionably, these caseload increases are the product
of the drug crisis which, perhaps for the first time in our
State's history, threatens to test our ability to administer
justice on the local level, not just in New York City, but
statewide. </p>

<p>The increasing number of drug prosecutions in New York's
courts has taken its toll on the judicial system. One New York
State Supreme Court Justice has summarized the impact of the
so-called &quot;war on drugs&quot; on New York's criminal justice
system as follows: </p>

<p>Our court calendars groan under the burden of ever-increasing
new drug cases. New York City's Corrections Department estimates
that 70 percent of its inmates are charged with drug-related
crimes. Yet these ever-growing prosecutions and incarcerations
are having little or no impact on drug crimes. In 1980 only 11
percent of the total inmate population was incarcerated for drug
offenses, yet by 1992 this figure rose to 44 percent. At a cost
of $30,000 per year to maintain each prisoner, our state spent
over $195 million in 1992 to confine drug offenders alone. Last
year the state's Office of Court Administration requested an
additional $40 million just to cover the expense of drug cases.
Since the advent of crack a decade ago, the city has hired 9,000
new police, 700 additional assistant district attorneys, and has
added 18,000 new cells on Rikers Island. The total cost: $591
million a year. </p>

<h4>2. Other States </h4>

<p>State court convictions for drug law violations have increased
dramatically nationwide since the mid-1980s. Between 1986 and
1988, there was a nearly 70% increase in the number of persons
convicted of felony drug trafficking or possession charges (from
135,000 to 225,000). The number of persons convicted who received
state prison sentences rose from 49,900 to 92,500. In 1988, drug
offenses accounted for approximately one-third of all felony
convictions in all state courts. </p>

<h4>3. Federal Courts </h4>

<p>The case loads and concomitant costs of managing drug cases in
federal courts also have increased substantially over the past
decade. In 1982, the budget for prosecution of all federal drug
cases in the United States was $78.9 million; in 1993, the budget
was ten times as much -- $795.9 million. In federal district
courts in 1989, a total of 54,643 criminal cases were prosecuted;
of those 16,834 (approximately 30%) were for drug offenses. In
1990, 19,271 defendants were prosecuted for drug offenses; of
those 3,083 were not convicted, and 16,188 were convicted: 13,036
by guilty plea (81%), and 3,121 after trial (19%). Between July
1992 and June 1993, 50,366 defendants were convicted in the
federal courts, and 27% of these (18,576) were convicted of
federal drug offenses. Expenses associated with appeals of
federal drug cases rose from $8.2 million in 1982 to $104.2
million budgeted in 1993. A significant portion of this increase
resulted from appeals filings in drug-related cases, which
totalled 1,583 in 1981, 4,386 in 1989, and 5,658 in 1990 (a 29%
increase from the previous year alone and, overall, a 383%
increase in ten years). In 1991, there were 5,570 federal
drug-related appeals filed. </p>

<h4>4. The Judiciary is Impatient with the Present System </h4>

<p>Federal and state judges throughout the United States have
publicly expressed frustration with the present laws prohibiting
drugs, and some senior federal judges have even refused to sit on
drug cases. In the Southern District of New York and in the
Eastern District of New York, Judges Whitman Knapp, Robert Sweet,
and Jack Weinstein have spoken out publicly against the present
laws and their associated draconian penalties, and Judges Knapp
and Weinstein have refused, as is their right as senior judges,
to preside over drug trials and sentences. State judges in New
York have also protested the increasing time on their calendars
that drug cases take and the Second Offender sentencing rule that
compels them to give lengthy prison sentences to second-time drug
offenders. These judges seek a solution to the &quot;war on
drugs&quot; before the whole judicial system breaks down under
the strain. </p>

<h4>5. Efforts to Handle Court Congestion </h4>

<p>Because of the enormous increase in drug cases, especially in
large urban areas, several stop-gap solutions are being pursued
to balance limited court resources against the burgeoning
caseloads. In New York City and New Orleans, for instance,
special narcotics divisions have been established to expedite
processing of drug felonies. These experimental programs are
designed to hear cases just prior to grand jury proceedings with
the goal of inducing defendants to accept plea bargains that are
better than would be expected if the case proceeded through the
grand jury process. Also, special court parts -- staffed by
personnel with expertise in drug cases, addiction, and community
treatment centers -- have been established in New York City to
deal exclusively with drug cases. Unfortunately, none of these
short-term solutions will correct the fundamental distortion of
the priorities of the state and federal judicial systems caused
by the &quot;war on drugs.&quot; </p>

<h3>B. THE PRISON STATE </h3>

<p>One of the most tangible, measurable effects of the &quot;war
on drugs,&quot; has been the creation of a &quot;prison
state&quot;. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's
statistics, one million arrests are made annually for violations
of the federal and state drug laws. As a result of these massive
numbers of arrests each year, &quot;the United States has a
higher proportion of its population incarcerated than any other
country in the world for which reliable statistics are
available.&quot; </p>

<p>Incarceration in America is now at an all-time high. From 1925
through 1973, the American prison population fluctuated between
90 and 120 people in prison per 100,000 of the population; in
1973 the rate was 98 per 100,000, a ten-year low. </p>

<p>Between 1973 and 1980, however, there was a 40% increase, to
135 people in prison per 100,000; and by 1986, following the
start of the modern &quot;war on drugs,&quot; the incarceration
rate had jumped to 200 per 100,000. In 1993, the rate of
Americans serving prison time stood at 325 per 100,000. In 1993,
the number of inmates in federal and state prisons in New York
increased by 4.6%, to 64,600. </p>

<p>On average, it costs $20,000 per year to maintain one
prisoner, $100,000 to build a single prison cell, and $20,000 per
year to staff a prison cell. </p>

<p>More than one in forty American males between the ages 14 and
34 are locked up. </p>

<p>Between 1980 and 1990, the total prison population in the
United States increased by 133% to over 771,000 prisoners. </p>

<p>In 1993, the total prison population reached 949,000, nearly
three times as many as in 1980. During the 1980s, new
imprisonments on drug charges increased over 1,000%. </p>

<p>Drug offenders have accounted for an increasing percentage of
the population in State and Federal correctional facilities. </p>

<p>Drug offenders constituted an estimated 22% of the State
prison population in 1991, up from 6% of the population in 1979.
In Federal correctional facilities, drug offenders accounted for
61% of the population, up from 16% in 1970, 25% in 1980, and 52%
in 1990. </p>

<p>The vast majority of the prison population increase during the
1980s, which doubled the number of persons under custody for all
charges, involved drug law violations. Due to the great increase
in drug-related incarcerations, the federal and state prison
systems are overwhelmed, as reported almost daily in the
newspapers. Prison overcrowding persists despite an unprecedented
boom in prison construction. For example, between 1983 and 1992,
New York State built 29 prisons, increasing the number of prisons
in the state to 68 and the inmate capacity from 29,253 to 57,862.
</p>

<p>No one wants overcrowding. It riles inmates, strains prison
guards, encourages the spread of illness and generally makes
prisons more volatile places. In the past, when there was money
to spend, the solution to overcrowding would have been clear --
create more space. Not any more. With money scarce and a sense
that more prison beds have not resulted in less crime, many
lawmakers are being forced to conclude they can no longer build
their way out of the problem. </p>

<p>According to the United States Department of Justice,
&quot;drug offenders&quot; are becoming a larger share of the
prison population for two reasons: first, the likelihood that a
conviction will result in incarceration is increasing; and
second, those convicted on drug charges are receiving longer
prison sentences. </p>

<p>Mandatory sentencing laws, such as the federal sentencing
guidelines, exacerbate the problem by forcing judges to impose
lengthy sentences for simple possession of small amounts of
drugs. These laws, first passed in the 1970s but increasingly
relied on as a weapon in the &quot;drug war&quot; in recent
years, have in large measure been responsible for today's severe
overcrowding. Mandatory minimum sentences require judges to
impose a statutorily-defined minimum period of incarceration
without the possibility of parole, with no consideration of the
specific facts of the crime or any mitigating circumstances.
Faced with mandatory sentences laws, there has been at a growing
movement at the state level to minimize their draconian effects.
In New York, for example, the courts had been cooperating with
prosecutors and defense attorneys to avoid the harsh effects on
second-time drug offenders. New York's Governor, Mario Cuomo, in
his 1994 budget message has asked the Legislature to restore
discretion to judges meting out second-time drug felony sentences
&quot;to relieve overcrowding in state prisons.&quot; </p>

<p>For all of the extra burden on the prison and judicial systems
and on the taxpayer caused by the &quot;war on drugs,&quot;
American society has little to show for it. &quot;If such
toughness had much to do with crime, you'd think we'd have seen
some results by now. But . . . overall crime has decreased only
6% since 1973; violent crimes are up 24%. The National Research
Council of the National Academy of Sciences recently concluded
that a tripling of time served by violent offenders since 1975
had `apparently very little' impact on violent crime.&quot; With
61% of today's federal inmates incarcerated on drug law
convictions, judiciary and corrections overcrowding and escalated
costs would necessarily be reduced were the current drug policy
altered toward a less punitive, more humane approach which
removes the profit motive fueling the black market in illegal
drugs. </p>

<h3>C. EROSION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL LIBERTIES </h3>

<p>One of the more insidious effects of the &quot;war on
drugs&quot; has been the gradual erosion of the rule of law and
the public's civil liberties. Several interrelated elements
contribute to this particularly destructive consequence of the
current drug laws. </p>

<h4>1. Perception of Ineffectiveness </h4>

<p>Politicians from the President of the United States to mayors
running in local elections are importuned by the people for the
assurance that increasing crime and the criminal element be
contained in our society. Our country, with the highest rate of
drug abuse of any industrial country in the world, also has the
largest budget in the world to enforce its laws prohibiting
drugs. Despite huge increases in the federal government's budget
for the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; the so-called &quot;drug
problem&quot; with all of its ramifications, has not
significantly abated. The public's perception of its political
leaders' ineffectiveness in alleviating drug-related violence
adds to the general atmosphere of lawlessness and breeds cynicism
and disrespect for the law. Instead of progress since the first
federal anti-drug law was passed in 1914, nearly 80 years of drug
prohibition have yielded few inroads against the sale or use of
drugs. This, understandably, suggests to the public that the law
itself is an ineffectual tool for dealing with the issue. </p>

<h4>2. Perception of a Self-Perpetuating System </h4>

<p>The large sums of money appropriated for law-enforcement
create enormous, self-perpetuating bureaucratic agencies, such as
the United States Drug Enforcement Agency (&quot;DEA&quot;),
which fight for independence and scarce public resources while
making little headway against the &quot;drug problem.&quot; These
agencies have ample motivation to exaggerate or distort the
extent and danger of &quot;drug abuse&quot; so as to justify (and
thereby insure) their continued existence. Being inherently
biased, they have great potential to ignore the public's true
welfare. </p>

<h4>3. Police Corruption </h4>

<p>The fact that drug prohibition breeds corruption has been
known for decades. Every day there are news stories of law
enforcement officers being arrested for their involvement with
drug dealers. The sums of money involved in the drug business are
too great and too inviting for the law enforcers not to seek
their share. Corrupt police behavior creates a further
disillusioned public. In addition, just as organized crime became
entrenched during Prohibition, the current prohibitionist regime
is currently subsidizing the mafia and other organized crime
groups because of the highly inflated prices on the black market.
</p>

<h4>4. Poor Children are Victims of the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; </h4>

<p>There is no reason to believe that recognized market forces
cease to apply where the drug business is concerned. There is
public recognition that youths and unemployed adults often cannot
just say &quot;no&quot; to drugs when saying &quot;yes&quot; as a
dealer or a dealer's helper is much more profitable than are the
alternatives. Children living in poor, urban neighborhoods are
particularly susceptible to being drawn into illegal drug-related
activities by visions of status and easy money. Laws against
drugs thus discourage many youths and adults from productive
legitimate employment that would benefit society. </p>

<h4>5. Selective Prosecution </h4>

<p>Criminal prosecutions for violations of the federal and state
drug laws appear to be disproportionately directed against
minorities. Understandably, there is widespread public concern
that the drug laws are selectively enforced with vigor against
the poor and disenfranchised, while rich and middle class drug
users are permitted to indulge without serious fear of legal
consequences. </p>

<h4>6. Erosion of Constitutional Rights </h4>

<p>The pursuit of a &quot;drug-free&quot; society has resulted in
a panoply of intrusions into the lives of United States citizens:
The Bill of Rights is in danger of becoming meaningless in cases
involving drugs. Tenants charged with no crime are evicted from
homes where police believe drugs are being sold. Public housing
projects are sealed for house-to-house inspections. The Supreme
Court has permitted warrantless searches of automobiles, the use
of anonymous tips and drug-courier profiles as the basis for
police searches, and the seizure of lawyers' fees in drug cases.
Property on which marijuana plants are found can be forfeited
even if the owner is charged with no crime. Prosecutors have been
allowed to try the same person at the state and federal levels
for the same drug-related crime. </p>

<p>A few examples will illustrate the erosion in individual civil
liberties occasioned by the &quot;war on drugs.&quot; In 1991,
the United States Supreme Court in Florida v. Bostick, upheld the
constitutionality of a police tactic of boarding long- distance
buses and asking permission to search passengers' baggage,
overruling the Florida Supreme Court's ruling that such an
encounter with the police is so inherently coercive that no
consent given for such a search could be truly voluntary. The
Florida v. Bostick decision was merely one of a number of rulings
since the early 1980s which authorized police stops and
questioning of airline, train, and bus passengers without the
level of suspicion generally required for Fourth Amendment search
and seizure purposes. </p>

<p>The search for tell-tale evidence of drug use has even
descended to the level of compelling federal employees to give
urine samples for analysis, without regard to whether such a
privacy intrusion is related to job performance. The public --
led by the government -- appears to be willing to jump on the
bandwagon &quot;to restrict civil liberties, and even accept
warrantless searches of homes and cars, in order to reduce the
use of illicit drugs.&quot; </p>

<h4>7. Forfeiture's Heavy Hand </h4>

<p>Forfeiture has become one of the most publicized and
controversial weapons in the government's anti-drug arsenal. Any
assumption, however, that the law would be deployed only against
&quot;drug kingpins&quot; and major players has proved
unwarranted as small time dealers and marginal users are more
often targeted: Under Zero Tolerance, which targets casual drug
users, the government has seized thousands of cars, boats, and
homes because occupants or guests allegedly carried drugs. In
1990, seizures exceeded $527 million, and they are expected to
exceed $700 million in 1991. The U.S. Marshalls Services now has
a $1.4 billion inventory of seized assets including more than
30,000 homes, cars, businesses and other property. </p>

<p>In the fiscal year 1993, &quot;the DEA made 14,430 domestic
seizures of nondrug property, valued at approximately $669
million.&quot; Moreover, forfeitures have become a popular way to
generate additional revenue. </p>

<p>The in rem nature of a civil forfeiture proceeding, replete
with its many procedural pitfalls, rests on the legal fiction
that the property itself is guilty of wrongdoing. The uneven
burdens of proof assigned the parties reveals the imbalance in
the system. To prevail, the government need only have reasonable
grounds to believe the property is subject to forfeiture. It
falls to the claimant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
the negative proposition that the property was
&quot;innocent.&quot; As a result of the over-zealous application
of the forfeiture statutes, the judiciary has attempted to curb
some of the more visible excesses. For instance, absent exigent
circumstances, pre-hearing seizures of homes, where the tenants
were either evicted outright or were permitted to stay at the
sufferance of the United States Marshall, are no longer
tolerated. And the forfeiture of real property is now expressly
subject to the limitations of Eighth Amendment proportionality
analysis. </p>

<p>A claimant's ability to defend against a forfeiture has long
been compromised by the maze of rules allowing for the freezing
of assets, which alone often discourages private counsel from
taking on a case. Too often, the failure to secure experienced
counsel results in the loss of the property. Finally, with news
accounts of law enforcement personnel driving around in expensive
cars seized during drug operations, reports of police helicopters
with sophisticated detection equipment hovering over homes, and
the intrusive subpoenaing of records from bona fide businesses
(such as those offering hydroponic gardening equipment), it is
clear that forfeiture laws require an overhaul. </p>

<h4>8. Erosion of Privacy Rights </h4>

<p>Although the Ninth Amendment guarantees that &quot;[t]he
enumeration in the Constitution of rights shall not be construed
to deny or disparage others retained by the people,&quot; our
society has struggled to find a balance between individual
liberty and privacy and governmental intrusion. Although the
United States Supreme Court has recognized certain activities as
being beyond the reach of most state or federal governmental
intrusion (e.g., birth control, abortion during the first
trimester, and the possession of adult pornography in the home),
drug use has never been found to be within the &quot;right of
privacy&quot; that the Court has forged. Because the law, as it
stands today, does not recognize the right to use drugs, the
&quot;war on drugs&quot; has become &quot;in effect, if not in
intention, a war on drug users.&quot; Year after year, state and
federal laws that prohibit the possession of drugs, demonize and
criminalize the users of drugs, estimated to be at least 20
million in the United States alone. Yet, &quot;[d]rugs have been
used to alter consciousness in most societies throughout history,
and different drugs have been considered acceptable at different
times and places.&quot; As Lester Grinspoon and James B. Bakalar
have stated: </p>

<p>Of all the Prohibition era mistakes we are now repeating, the
most serious is trying to free society of drugs by the use of
force. There is no reason to believe that the inclination to
ingest substances that alter consciousness can be eradicated. A
drug-free society is an impossible and probably an undesirable
dream. . . . Our present drug policies are immoral because they
require a war of annihilation against a wrongly chosen enemy. We
will never be able to regulate the use of consciousness-altering
drugs effectively until our ends are changed along with the means
that serve them. </p>

<p>Ending drug prohibition would enable the Court and our society
to recognize the right of individuals to alter their
consciousness (the most private of matters), so long as they do
not harm the persons or property of others. </p>

<h3>D. PROHIBITION-INDUCED VIOLENCE </h3>

<p>In New York and elsewhere in the United States, wild shootouts
in urban areas are frequently publicized. These reports reveal
that innocent bystanders in these areas are often caught in the
cross-fire. It is, however, far from clear that the use of or
need for prohibited drugs causes this sort of violent crime.
Rather, the available evidence tends to support the conclusion
that it is the prohibitionist laws against drugs that cause the
violent crimes that people generally deplore. </p>

<p>So-called &quot;drug-related crime&quot; is often related only
indirectly to the drugs themselves, resulting instead from the
illegal black market in drugs that is, in turn, spawned by laws
prohibiting the legal sale of drugs. For example, the Los Angeles
police have long known that the lucrative black market in cocaine
has provided the incentive (as well as the financing) for the
bloody gang turf wars in that city. Similarly, it is estimated
that 40% of the homicides in a study of 414 homicides in New York
City precincts were indirectly attributable to black market
trafficking in drugs. Further supporting the fact that it is drug
prohibition rather than drug use which is causing the alarming
&quot;drug-related&quot; violence saturating our culture is the
historical precedent of alcohol Prohibition which was accompanied
by the same type of violence. </p>

<p>There is no reason to believe that black markets would not
disappear with the ending of drug prohibition. Common sense
indicates that without the immense profits guaranteed by the
necessarily restricted nature of the outlets, there would be
little advantage to maintaining such black markets. The current
patterns of drug-sale related turf violence would be
substantially, if not wholly, undermined. </p>

<h3>E. PROHIBITION'S FAILURE TO LIMIT DRUG USE </h3>

<p>Proponents of the &quot;war on drugs&quot; often eagerly
declare that the draconian prohibitionist laws of the state and
federal government are causing a decline in drug use. The
evidence, however, tends to show that &quot;the number of heavy
drug users in the United States is undiminished.&quot; In
addition, recent surveys show an increasing number of high school
students using marijuana and lysergic acid diethylamide
(&quot;LSD&quot;). Even proponents of the &quot;war on
drugs&quot; candidly admit that &quot;drug abuse cannot be
entirely eliminated.&quot; Some experts have estimated that the
government has spent close to $500 billion dollars over the past
20 years to enforce the prohibitionist laws against drugs, while
during the same period use levels rose and the number of arrests
and the amounts of drugs seized increased unabated annually.
750,000 people were incarcerated for violating the prohibitionist
drug laws during a twenty-year period, costing an average of $25
billion annually and $61 billion for 1991 alone. </p>

<p>Although the vast majority of Americans polled stated that
they would not take now-prohibited drugs if they were legalized,
many people voice the concern that use would escalate sharply
upon legalization. Implicit in the idea that use of drugs would
rise upon legalization is the assumption that the current
prohibitionist laws discourage many people from using them. The
available evidence tends to show that Americans can and do
voluntarily control their use of drugs. </p>

<p>The recent decline in middle class use of drugs as well as
recent declines in alcohol and tobacco consumption have been
attributed by many experts to factors (such as education, health
and fitness awareness, and social pressures) other than the
prohibitionist laws against drugs. Experts have recognized these
other factors as the basis for the current levels of use of drugs
(including alcohol and tobacco) rather than the existence of
prohibitionist laws. Indeed some observers have cited the
prohibitionist laws against drugs as a significant factor leading
to increased use and greater numbers of addicts than we would
otherwise have: [T]he growth of addiction over the last four
decades in the US had little to do with price reductions or, for
that matter, with the growth of real income. The crucial factor
in the spread of the drug habit has been the unrelenting pressure
exerted by legions of street pushers in the continuing endeavor
to widen the circle of the customers. In other words, the crucial
factor in spreading the drug habit has been the super profits
made possible only by governments' illegalization of the
trade.&quot; </p>

<p>It is impossible to prove the levels of post- legalization use
of now-prohibited drugs, but reasonable extrapolations may be
made by referring to similar experiences in this country and
abroad. </p>

<p>Prohibition of alcohol in the United States earlier in this
century is a basis for comparison, albeit an imperfect one. A
review of alcohol consumption patterns during and after
Prohibition shows that during most of the Prohibition era per
capita alcohol consumption actually increased. After
&quot;Prohibition's repeal in 1933, consumption remained fairly
stable until after the Second World War when, without any change
in public policy, it began increasing.&quot; The prohibitionist
laws, therefore, seem to have little impact on an individual's
decision whether to use drugs. Another useful example is the
experience of the ten states that decriminalized the possession
of small amounts of marijuana for personal consumption in the
1970s. There was no increase in the level of marijuana use in
those states. Indeed marijuana consumption declined in those
states just as it did in states that retained criminal sanctions
against marijuana. In 1976, the Dutch decriminalized marijuana
consumption, although possession and small sales technically
remained illegal. The level of use actually declined after
decriminalization. Indeed marijuana use in the Netherlands is
substantially lower than in countries waging a &quot;war on
drugs,&quot; including the United States and, at least until
recently, Germany. Among Dutch youths aged 17-18, only 17.7% used
marijuana at least once in their lifetimes, as opposed to 43.7%
of Americans. Only 4.6% of the Dutch had used marijuana at least
once in the past month, as opposed to 16.7% of the Americans. </p>

<p>While indicating clearly that prohibitionist laws do not
prevent the use of drugs, these statistics also tend to show that
legalizing now-prohibited drugs, at least marijuana, does not
inevitably cause an increase in use. Under an exception to the
British prohibitionist system, doctors may provide prohibited
drugs to addicts. Dr. John Marks of Liverpool commenced such a
program in 1982, and, to his astonishment, he noted that the
number of new addicts decreased in Liverpool while in a nearby
town operating under prohibition the rate of new addicts was
twelve-fold higher. Dr. Marks attributed the decline in the
number of new addicts to the fact that addicts received their
needed drugs from his program for pennies, thus there was no
longer any need for addicts to bring in new customers to raise
enough money to support their habits. Others addressing the issue
of whether the levels of use of now prohibited drugs would
escalate to overwhelming proportions after legalization (as many
prohibitionists have predicted) have likened possible patterns of
illegal drug use to patterns of alcohol use, with which we have a
solid familiarity. They point out that Western cultures have
handled alcohol consumption with tolerable skill for centuries
and point out that most of the American population that drinks
occasionally, or even every day, exercises moderation. </p>

<p>Indeed the available data indicate that the vast majority of
the American population that uses now-prohibited drugs does so
with moderation. According to United States government
statistics, more than 75 million persons in the United States
household population have used prohibited drugs. The National
Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that close to 40 million
Americans continue to consume these substances. Yet, only a
comparatively minuscule number of deaths due to drug overdoses,
4,242, occurred in 1991 according to medical examiner data
compiled by the Drug Abuse Warning Network. Once the distinction
between use of prohibited drugs and abuse is acknowledged, the
available statistics show that the vast majority of Americans who
use drugs do not abuse them. </p>

<p>Based on our experience with American states' and foreign
decriminalization of marijuana, it appears that decriminalization
does not lead to greater levels of use nor to abuse. Likewise
there is evidence to support the proposition that the
decriminalization of the so-called &quot;hard drugs&quot; does
not lead to increased rates of addiction. Perhaps most
importantly, data analysis strongly indicates that social factors
wholly apart from the criminalization of drugs account in the
greatest measure for reduced rates of use. Based on the evidence,
it would not be unfair to say that the predicted,
post-legalization explosion in the use of drugs has been greatly
overstated and that use in continued moderation would be the much
more likely result. European countries, such as the Netherlands,
have benefitted from an approach to drugs that focuses on
&quot;harm reduction&quot; rather than draconian measures to
enforce prohibition. </p>

<h3>F. PROHIBITION THREATENS PUBLIC HEALTH </h3>

<h4>1. Spread of Disease </h4>

<h5>a. Sharing Needles </h5>

<p>Because the possession of hypodermic needles is generally
illegal, users of injectable drugs routinely share needles and
syringes with one another, often in &quot;shooting
galleries&quot; where dozens of addicts may line up to use a
single needle rented out by the dealers and not sterilized
between uses. This sharing of needles has become a major source
of transmission of blood-borne diseases such as acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (&quot;AIDS&quot;) and hepatitis. According
to a recent national review, &quot;more than 33% of new AIDS
cases occur among injecting drug users or people having sexual
contact with them.&quot; In New York State, the majority of new
AIDS cases since 1988 have been reported among users of
injectable drugs and their sexual partners. Both the Centers for
Disease Control and the New York State Department of Health have
estimated that more than 75% of pediatric AIDS cases are children
whose mothers either injected drugs or were the sexual partners
of persons who injected drugs. The data suggest, at the very
least, that sterile hypodermic needles should be readily and
freely available to drug users. So long as drug use remains
unlawful, however, free needle distribution is not likely to
attract a substantial portion of the user population. In
response, some courts have circumscribed laws dealing with the
unlawful possession of hypodermic needles by applying defenses of
medical necessity. </p>

<h5>b. Trading Sex for Drugs </h5>

<p>Because illicit drugs are expensive, many addicts turn to
prostitution to make money to support their habits, or exchange
sexual services directly for drugs. Prostitute drug addicts often
do not protect themselves from contracting sexually transmitted
diseases carried by their customers, and they pass such diseases
on to other customers, their lovers, and their children. The
crack epidemic, in particular, has been blamed for the recently
noted resurgence of syphilis and other sexually transmitted
diseases. </p>

<p>Dr. Robert Rolfs of the Centers for Disease Control placed the
blame squarely on cocaine and its high cost: People -- especially
women -- have high-risk sex and practice prostitution to support
their habits. And it is occurring in a relatively poor population
where people have a lot of things that prevent their access to
treatment. Therefore, they stay infected longer and are more
likely to pass their infections on to others. Fewer addicts would
be forced to resort to prostitution if the current prohibitions
against drugs were lifted. </p>

<h5>c. Neglect of Health </h5>

<p>Because of addicts' preoccupation with obtaining and using
drugs, and the debilitating effects of some of the drugs
themselves, many addicts are in very poor health. Malnutrition is
a frequent problem and, in turn, contributes to many others.
Addicts' poor health makes them especially susceptible to
diseases ranging from scurvy and shingles to tuberculosis and the
flu. Addicts are also more likely to contract communicable
diseases and therefore more likely to spread them. The
interrelated urban problems of homelessness and illegal drug
abuse have contributed to the development of multi-drug-resistant
strains of diseases such as tuberculosis, which was once thought
to be on the verge of eradication. These more virulent diseases
know few geographical limitations and pose risks to the general
population. </p>

<h5>d. Avoidance of the Health-Care System </h5>

<p>Individuals who use illegal drugs often put off addressing
their health problems for fear of prosecution or other adverse
consequences (e.g., rebuffs by doctors, loss of job). This
reluctance to seek medical care is compounded by the fact that
many drug addicts have no private physicians and rely instead on
public hospitals or clinics for any care they might get.
Prohibition, therefore, has perverse results on health; drug
abusers tend to enter the health-care system only if and when
their need for care is acute, which is also when care is most
costly to deliver. If, for example, a woman avoids pre-natal
care, she may give birth to a baby with low birth weight and
other medical difficulties. If a drug abuser puts off seeking
treatment for illnesses and injuries, he or she may end up in the
emergency room and the intensive care ward. Mothers and pregnant
women face the additional and justifiable fear that any
detectable drug use may be reported as a possible indication of
child abuse or neglect. In many large city hospitals, the urine
of newborn babies is tested for prohibited drugs, and mothers
whose babies test positive for pre-natal exposure are reported to
the child abuse authorities. </p>

<p>Until recently, in New York City, such babies were routinely
kept from their mothers pending investigations that often lasted
many months, interfering with normal bonding and necessarily
adversely affecting the infant's development and relationship
with the parent. Moreover, these women have, in some
jurisdictions, been prosecuted for pre-partum distribution of
prohibited drugs. </p>

<p>In addition to the obvious costs to the individuals who become
infected with catastrophic illnesses directly through drug use,
and the high costs to the health care system of treating them,
prohibition contributes to the spread of such diseases throughout
society, particularly to the sexual partners and children of
infected drug users. Left untreated, users and addicts are more
likely to give birth to unhealthy children, to abuse or neglect
their children after they are born, or to have their children
placed in foster care. </p>

<h4>2. Lack of Information and Quality Control </h4>

<h5>a. Adulterated Drugs, Designer Drugs, and Drugs of Unknown
Potency </h5>

<p>Because drugs are manufactured and distributed in secret, it
is impossible for users to guard against adulteration or to
determine the purity and potency of the drugs they use. The
problem is compounded by drug growers, manufacturers, and
distributors who, to minimize the risks of apprehension, develop
and purvey the drug varieties that pack the most intoxicating
effect into the smallest package. According to an experienced New
York City researcher, The fact that cocaine, heroin and related
drugs are illegal encourages the use of injection. Severe
statutory restrictions greatly increase the cost of illicit
substances to nonmedical users. Injecting provides a way to
economize. Injectable forms of opiates and coca are much more
concentrated than traditional forms, such as opium or coca tea.
Injection provides an intense and economical effect by maximizing
the amount of drug that reaches the brain. People who sniff or
smoke drugs say that if they inject they need only one third of
the amount of the drug to maintain a habit. </p>

<p>Because the injection forms of illicit drugs are concentrated,
they are [also] relatively easier to ship. It has been
demonstrated that, as law enforcement and criminal penalties
intensify, dealers also find other ways to economize by inventing
new drugs -- so-called &quot;designer drugs&quot; -- that are not
yet prohibited. This places the ill-informed consumers of such
drugs at greater risk of overdose and other health problems.
Illnesses and deaths have resulted from (1) the introduction of
dangerous substances into drugs that could otherwise have been
used with greater safety, (2) inadvertent overdoses due to
variations in potency, and (3) the development of &quot;designer
drugs&quot; intended to give the effect of familiar intoxicants
with new chemical compositions that put them beyond the reach of
current laws. Just as the prohibition against alcohol led to
sales of poisonous wood alcohol and the prohibition against
abortion led to coat-hanger abortions, the prohibition against
drug manufacture, sale, and possession results in unnecessary
deaths due to adulteration, variable purity, and &quot;designer
drugs.&quot; This contrasts sharply with the government's current
regulation of alcoholic beverages, which ensures that the
beverages are pure and that buyers know how strong they are and
what some of their health effects may be. </p>

<p>Experts have noted that heightened efforts to enforce drug
laws and amend them to encompass new formulations or ban
precursor substances may only push dealers to take greater risks,
selling ever more potentially dangerous substances. </p>

<h5>b. Lack of Knowledge About Safer Use </h5>

<p>Because many drugs are outlawed, individuals considering drug
use rarely have access to accurate information about the effects
of drugs. While a cautious user may err on the side of avoiding
certain activities while under the use of drugs, he or she may
have no way of knowing, beyond trial and error, the possible
adverse health consequences of certain combinations of drugs and
his or her individual tolerance for particular substances.
Because of its penchant for exaggeration and cartoonish treatment
of the issues, most current education about drugs is not taken
seriously by young people. As a result, it is far less effective
than other health education (e.g., about nutrition, fitness, and
smoking cigarettes). </p>

<h5>c. Using Alcohol and Tobacco Instead of &quot;Soft
Drugs&quot; </h5>

<p>Alcohol and tobacco are completely legal yet do much more
harm, statistically speaking, than illegal drug use. It is also
generally recognized that alcohol, at least when used to excess,
can cause aggressive, anti-social behavior. The current
prohibitionist laws against marijuana, generally considered an
&quot;a-motivational&quot; drug, and other so-called &quot;soft
drugs&quot; have the effect of influencing some people to choose
alcohol over these &quot;soft drugs.&quot; Peter Reuter, an
economist at the Rand Corporation, concludes that &quot;If
marijuana is a substitute for alcohol . . . , alcohol is, by
definition, a substitute for marijuana. Thus tough marijuana
enforcement must increase drinking.&quot; Similarly, Frank
Chaloupka, an economist at the University of Illinois, found
through statistical analysis &quot;that states without criminal
sanctions against marijuana possession suffered fewer auto
fatalities.&quot; Finally, Karen Model, a Ph.D. candidate at
Harvard, found that &quot;states decriminalizing marijuana
reported lower overall rates of drug- and alcohol-related
emergencies.&quot; To the extent that users are choosing alcohol
rather than marijuana or other &quot;soft drugs,&quot; the
overall public health effects are probably worse than they would
be otherwise. </p>

<h4>3. Injuries Due to Violence </h4>

<p>The high prices commanded by prohibited drugs create
competition among groups and individuals willing to break the law
to supply drugs to consumers. Their competition often becomes
violent and has contributed to the build-up of arms and the
pervasiveness of violence in many areas. Gunshot wounds and other
traumas due to the illegal drug business have become commonplace
in big-city hospital emergency rooms. Not only traffickers, but
also law enforcement officers and innocent bystanders are often
the victims. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently noted: </p>

<p>The victims of the[] gun battles [of street-level drug
dealers] are innocent bystanders -- and often young children.
Last year alone, about 500 New York City children were shot; of
these, 89 were innocent bystanders hit by crossfire. The cost of
prohibiting drugs must be measured in terms of lost lives and
expensive medical care and include the hidden costs of lost
productivity and the psychological damage to individuals and
entire communities living in fear, helpless and hopeless. </p>

<p>With the possible exceptions of cocaine and PCP, drugs
themselves do not generally cause violent behavior. It is,
instead, turf wars for the control of black markets and the drug
users' need for money to purchase such substances that leads to
violence. Indeed, marijuana and heroin have been shown to render
their users disinclined to violence or incapable of violence
while under the influence. These substances are much less
dangerous in this regard than alcohol. </p>

<h4>4. Diversion of Resources from Treatment and Prevention </h4>

<p>Prohibition diverts money that could otherwise be used for
preventing and treating drug abuse. Federal anti-drug legislation
provides a single budget for &quot;supply reduction&quot; and
&quot;demand reduction&quot; efforts. Law enforcement agencies
have always received much more than prevention, treatment, and
research programs combined. The ABA recently reported that
&quot;[s]ince the early 1980s, treatment has been a declining
priority. In 1991, treatment received 14% of the $10.5 billion
federal drug budget compared to 25% ten years earlier.&quot;
During the same period, &quot;federal spending on law enforcement
increased 737%, with interdiction efforts leading the
increase.&quot; Ending drug prohibition would, by definition,
eliminate the need for any special law enforcement funds for drug
interdiction. It would also allow for the redirection of law
enforcement resources to concentrate on violent crime and quality
of life issues. </p>

<h4>5. The Sense of Treating Drugs as a Public Health Problem </h4>

<h5>a. Treatment Works </h5>

<p>The vast majority of resources in the United States available
to meet this country's &quot;drug problem&quot; have been
utilized for interdiction rather than education and treatment.
This allocation of resources has skewed the public's perception
of the problem, which is seen largely as one of law enforcement.
However, drug abuse and drug addiction are fundamentally a public
health problem. </p>

<p>Reallocation of resources away from interdiction and into
education and treatment is essential to the successful management
of this problem. Drug abuse and drug addiction are health
problems that can be treated. Dr. Herbert D. Kleber, former
Deputy Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
now Medical Director of the Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse and lecturer in psychiatry at Columbia University College
of Physicians and Surgeons, has identified a basic fallacy
responsible for the predominant pessimistic outlook: </p>

<p>Drug dependence has been viewed as a chronic relapsing illness
with an unfavorable prognosis. However, there are thousands of
formerly dependent individuals in the United States and elsewhere
who have remained off both illicit drugs and excess use of licit
drugs like alcohol for decades, functioning as productive
citizens . . . . [T]here are already effective methods of
treatment if the right approach [and] the right person can be
brought together. </p>

<p>No one should conclude that treatment is not effective just
because drug abuse, like alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking,
often cannot be &quot;cured&quot; with a single treatment effort.
Most people who do conquer drug addiction succeed only after
multiple efforts and relapses. Because effective treatment
depends on finding the best method of helping a particular person
at a particular time, several attempts may be needed to discover
what will work. </p>

<h5>b. Self-Help Groups </h5>

<p>Some substance abusers manage their problem with the help of
Alcoholics Anonymous (&quot;AA&quot;), Narcotics Anonymous
(&quot;NA&quot;) or similar groups. These voluntary self-help
associations offer the structure of a program following
&quot;twelve steps&quot; to sobriety and the support of fellow
abusers in different stages of recovery. Since these groups
maintain members' confidentiality and do not keep records of
attendance at meetings, their success has not been measured
statistically; however, anecdotal evidence of their effectiveness
is strong. Additionally, many respected treatment programs rely
on methods developed by the self-help groups and prescribe
attendance at AA and NA meetings for their patients. </p>

<h5>c. Therapeutic Communities </h5>

<p>One of the best-known methods of professional treatment for
drug abuse is a highly structured, long-term residential
inpatient program known as a therapeutic community. The Committee
visited three therapeutic community facilities in New York City
-- programs operated by Daytop Village, Project Return and
Phoenix House. Patients in therapeutic communities generally
spend one to two years, sometimes more, living and working in the
facility. Through individual counseling and group therapy, the
patients address the causes and effects of their substance abuse
and other problems and attempt to rebuild their lives free of
drugs. Education, vocational training and work experience are
important components of the treatment, because therapeutic
community patients frequently lack necessary skills for making
their own way in society. Successful patients gradually re-enter
the outside world, first obtaining jobs and ultimately moving to
homes outside the program. While many patients drop out of these
challenging and restrictive programs, research has shown that
three-quarters of the patients who stay for the prescribed course
of treatment remained drug-free seven years later. One study
found that 56% of the individuals entering residential treatment
(including those who dropped out) no longer used heroin or
cocaine one year later. By the end of the study, more than 80% of
the patients no longer used any prohibited drug other than
marijuana. Another different national study that focused on
opiate addicts revealed that nearly three quarters (74%) of the
addicts who entered therapeutic communities were not using
opiates regularly (i.e., on a daily basis) three years later. </p>

<h5>d. Other Inpatient Drug-Free Treatment Programs </h5>

<p>Substance abusers with health insurance or other means of
payment often seek residential treatment in less restrictive
settings and for shorter periods of time. Two of the best-known
programs providing this sort of inpatient treatment are the Betty
Ford Center in Palm Springs, California, and the Hazelden program
in Minnesota. Patients usually participate in intensive
individual counseling, group therapy, and AA or NA meetings.
Patients most commonly stay for four weeks and are then
discharged to &quot;aftercare&quot; programs for continuing
outpatient treatment or are advised to seek AA or NA meetings in
the community. Many prominent citizens have testified publicly to
the efficacy and value of these sorts of treatment programs. </p>

<h5>e. Outpatient Methadone Maintenance Programs </h5>

<p>Methadone maintenance is the most widely used treatment for
narcotics addiction in the United States. Drs. Vincent P. Dole
and Marie Nyswander developed the treatment at Rockefeller
University in the early 1960s. Heroin addicts who are medicated
with an appropriate daily dose of methadone, a long-acting
synthetic opiate, lose the desire to use heroin but do not
experience either withdrawal symptoms or the euphoric or
impairing effects of narcotic use. Methadone patients can
function normally and perform successfully in the workplace in
jobs ranging from attorney to architect to bus driver. </p>

<p>In the early stages of treatment, methadone patients visit the
program daily to receive their doses. They are granted more
flexible schedules as they show progress in treatment by
remaining free of other drugs, maintaining steady employment, and
making progress in other areas. Methadone programs also provide
counseling and other health care and usually arrange for
vocational rehabilitation, education, and other services. </p>

<p>Successful methadone patients may remain in treatment for many
years, often at reduced doses; and some eventually leave
treatment entirely. </p>

<p>A high proportion of methadone patients stay in treatment
(more than two-thirds, by many reports), and more than 85% of
those remaining in treatment for a year never use heroin again. A
substantial proportion also stop using alcohol and other drugs.
The results of research assessing the effectiveness of methadone
maintenance have been strikingly consistent. One major study
found that, within a year of beginning treatment, 70% of those
who had entered methadone treatment were no longer using heroin.
After three years, use by patients who had remained with the
program for at least three months had declined by almost 85%.
Another study examining AIDS infection among injection drug users
found that methadone maintenance treatment effectively reduced
intravenous drug use by 71%. An earlier study had found that more
than three quarters of the patients who entered methadone
maintenance treatment were still not regularly using opiates
three years later. </p>

<h5>f. Outpatient Drug-Free Therapy </h5>

<p>Substance abusers who cannot commit themselves to inpatient
treatment and do not want methadone treatment (or would not
benefit from it because their primary drug of abuse is not
heroin) can participate in a variety of outpatient drug-free
therapies, including the full range of &quot;talk&quot;
therapies, supervised twelve-step programs, and programs that use
acupuncture to reduce the craving for drugs. Outpatient programs
often are recommended as follow-ups to short-term hospital-based
&quot;detoxification&quot; programs, which generally are
effective only for short-term crisis intervention purposes. </p>

<p>The Committee visited the Lincoln Hospital Substance Abuse
Division in New York City, which has been treating drug abuse
patients with acupuncture for more than 15 years. </p>

<p>Acupuncture treatment, which involves the insertion of five
needles in the outer ear while the patients sit quietly in a
common room for 30 to 45 minutes, is meant to control withdrawal
symptoms and the craving for drugs and to have a general calming
effect. At Lincoln Hospital it is used in combination with group
counseling on the Narcotics Anonymous model, as well as
urinalysis monitoring. Like methadone treatment, acupuncture
begins as a daily treatment, with successful patients
&quot;graduating&quot; to less frequent schedules. Outpatient
drug-free treatment programs, whether they employ acupuncture or
not, differ in the nature, length and frequency of treatment
sessions. </p>

<p>The usefulness of acupuncture treatment for substance abuse
has been demonstrated in several studies. Outpatient programs,
generally, have demonstrated a fair amount of success in treating
substance abusers. One national study found that nearly
three-quarters of the patients who entered outpatient drug-free
programs for opiate abuse were not using opiates regularly three
years later. A later study of similar scope revealed that, after
a year in treatment, 42% of the regular cocaine users who stayed
in outpatient drug-free treatment for at least three months had
stopped using cocaine completely. Over three to five years,
regular heroin use by patients who had received treatment for at
least three months fell by half, and fewer than 20% of the
patients who stayed in treatment for at least three months were
regular users of any prohibited drug except marijuana. </p>

<h4>6. Empirical Research on Effective Drug Treatment </h4>

<p>Virtually all studies conducted over the last 20 years show
that the most commonly practiced methods of treatment do work.
Treatment has been shown to reduce substance abuse and ameliorate
its consequences. The outcome of treatment has not been found to
differ significantly with the type of treatment received.
Methadone programs, inpatient residential programs, and
outpatient drug-free programs all show dramatic results. </p>

<h5>a. Studies Examining the Effects of Treatment on Substance
Use </h5>

<p>The most comprehensive study of the effectiveness of drug
treatment, the Treatment Outcomes Prospective Survey
(&quot;TOPS&quot;) funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(&quot;NIDA&quot;), strongly confirmed the efficacy of treatment
in reducing drug use. For up to five years after their treatment,
TOPS followed 10,000 substance abusers who had been admitted to
37 different treatment programs across the country. The programs
included residential and outpatient drug-free programs and
outpatient methadone maintenance programs. Heroin and cocaine use
declined significantly for patients in all treatment modalities.
After a year in treatment, heroin use by patients in methadone
maintenance programs declined by 70%, while 75% of outpatient
drug-free patients and 56% of residential treatment patients had
stopped using heroin or cocaine. By the end of the study, fewer
than 20% of the patients regularly used any illegal drug except
marijuana, and 40% to 50% of the patients abstained altogether. </p>

<p>Other studies have reached virtually identical conclusions. A
study sponsored by NIDA to address the risk of AIDS infection for
injection drug users found that methadone maintenance treatment
effectively reduced intravenous drug use by 71% among those who
remained in the program for one year. An earlier NIDA study based
on the Drug Abuse Report Program (&quot;DARP&quot;) tracked the
drug use of 44,000 opiate addicts admitted to treatment between
1969 and 1974. The study found that most patients stopped using
opiates daily and had not resumed daily use three years after
they were discharged from treatment. More than three quarters of
the patients who entered methadone maintenance treatment (76%)
and nearly three quarters of the patients who entered therapeutic
communities (74%) or outpatient drug-free programs (72%) were
still not using opiates regularly three years later. A recent
follow-up study of 405 of the original 44,000 addicts found that
74% were not using heroin regularly twelve years after their
treatment ended. </p>

<p>Researchers have uniformly concluded that the three most
common forms of treatment are effective despite &quot;the variety
of problems suffered by clients, their long histories of deviant
and debilitating lifestyles, and a lack of support in the
community&quot; that lead so many addicts not to complete
treatment programs at all. Researchers also agree that the longer
addicts remain in treatment, the better their chances of success.
National studies of the behavior of thousands of addicts have
shown that, while one-third of the patients who stay in treatment
for more than three months are still not using drugs a year
later, two-thirds of those who stay in treatment for a year or
more stay off drugs. </p>

<h5>b. Studies Examining the Effects of Drug </h5>

<p>Treatment on the Consequences of Drug Abuse </p>

<p>Researchers have studied the impact of drug treatment on many
of the health and social problems that drug abuse contributes to
-- the spread of AIDS and other diseases, premature death, crime,
unemployment, costly medical care -- as one way of assessing the
success of drug treatment. Their studies have shown that
treatment reduces these associated consequences of drug abuse.
Treatment prevents the transmission of HIV and other blood-borne
diseases that spread when addicts share needles or sell sex for
drugs. Two studies have shown that the rate of HIV infection
among heroin addicts in New York City not in treatment (46%-47%)
is twice the rate of infection among addicts in methadone
treatment programs (23%-27%), and a recent study found that none
of a group of methadone patients with ten or more years in
treatment tested positive for HIV. </p>

<p>Research has shown that treatment also prevents crime. The
TOPS survey found that, in the six months following treatment,
97% of the residential therapeutic community clients and 70% of
the outpatient clients who had admitted committing predatory
crimes in the year before they entered treatment engaged in no
criminal activity at all. Three to five years after treatment,
the proportion of addicts involved in predatory crimes had fallen
by one half to two-thirds. The DARP study found that arrest rates
fell by 74% after treatment, for all treatment modalities.
Research reveals that treatment helps recovering addicts work, as
well. Only 33% of the 44,000 patients in the DARP study worked in
the year before admission to treatment, but 57% were employed in
the year following their discharge. Two- thirds of therapeutic
community patients were gainfully employed after discharge. The
employment rate of clients tracked in the TOPS study also surged.
Three to five years after patients entered treatment, the
employment of patients admitted to residential programs had
doubled over pre-treatment levels, while the employment of
addicts receiving outpatient treatment rose by more than half. </p>

<p>The costs of medical treatment for all sorts of health
problems decline when addicts receive treatment. As noted earlier
in this report, addicts themselves suffer many costly illnesses
as a result of drug use, ranging from hepatitis, syphilis and
tuberculosis to shingles, malnutrition and psychiatric problems.
In 1989, general hospital stays in which drugs or alcohol were
identified as a major factor accounted for 1.9 million days of
hospitalization in New York State alone. Using a conservatively
estimated average cost of $500 a day, that amounts to $9.5
billion worth of medical care. </p>

<p>Successful drug treatment starts addicts on their way to
physical recovery and therefore reduces these medical costs.
Successful drug treatment also prevents the spread of diseases to
others, such as children born to addicted mothers, and stems the
cost of medical care for them, as well as the cost of foster care
for children whose addicted parents cannot care for them. Other
benefits of treatment flow from its effects on criminal behavior
and employment. Treated addicts are much more likely to be
employed and therefore to contribute to the public coffers rather
than receive welfare. They make more productive employees and are
less likely to have accidents at work. Treated addicts are far
less likely to commit crimes and therefore will save society the
cost of property loss and prosecuting criminal activity. One
study that calculated the cost of crime, poor employment
activity, and medical treatment attributable to drug addiction
found that the total of these costs was ten to twenty-five times
the cost of treating drug addiction, depending on the cost of the
treatment chosen. The cost of treating an addict in a long-term
residential drug-free program, for example, was found to amount
to only four percent of the cost to society of not treating the
addict. </p>

<p>A comparison of costs also shows that treatment is much more
cost-effective than incarceration. In New York City, residential
drug treatment costs approximately $17,000 a year per treatment
bed, and outpatient treatment costs only $2,300-$4,000 a year per
treatment slot; the annual operating cost of a prison bed is
about $40,000, and the cost of building new prison cells exceeds
$100,000 each. Diverting drug abusers from prison to treatment
therefore saves New York State or City half the operating costs
of incarceration. It also alleviates the need to build expensive
new prisons. If the proven effect of treatment on criminal
recidivism is included, the savings to the criminal justice
system in the future would be even more substantial. Treatment
works and is, in fact, a much more cost-effective way of dealing
with substance abuse than arresting drug offenders and locking
them in prison. Successfully treated drug addicts give up crime,
become productive and more healthy citizens, and ultimately make
fewer demands on the public for social and medical services
throughout their lives. Their cure also reduces the overall
demand for drugs. </p>

<h4>7. Education Works </h4>

<p>One way to reduce the demand for illegal drugs is to prevent
individuals at an early and impressionable age from initiating
drug use. Using the school system and community programs to
educate children about drug use and its destructive consequences
is an idea that would undoubtedly be supported by many segments
of society. Logic suggests that education programs should be
effective in diverting young people from experimenting with
drugs. </p>

<p>Mathea Falco, in her book The Making of a Drug Free America,
details both school-based and community-based educational
programs which have proven results in preventing drug, alcohol
and tobacco use. Education has been shown to be effective in
preventing and reducing drug as well as tobacco and alcohol use
among children and teenagers. Simply to advocate
&quot;education,&quot; however, may not be enough; the assumption
that &quot;education,&quot; and any type of education program,
will be effective may be erroneous. Studies of the effectiveness
of drug education and prevention strategies seem to suggest that
long- term programs geared towards examining the &quot;social
influences&quot; leading to drug, alcohol, and tobacco use are
more successful in diverting and reducing subsequent use of
drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. These successful educational
programs are generally coupled with community and home prevention
and education programs. In contrast, certain short-term education
programs, which lack the corresponding community programs, have
not proven effective in actually reducing drug use. </p>

<h5>a. Life Skills Training Program </h5>

<p>This 15 session curriculum, which is geared towards junior
high school students, is designed to teach students personal
coping skills so that they may be better able to make decisions
and feel more confident in social situations. Evaluations of this
program, which has been taught in 150 junior high schools in New
York and New Jersey for the past ten years, show that rates of
smoking and marijuana use are one-half to three-quarters lower
among students who have participated in this program than those
who have not. </p>

<h5>b. Students Taught Awareness and Resistance </h5>

<p>This program, taught to first-year high school students,
combines a thirteen session classroom curriculum with
coordinating community, media, and family programs in an effort
to teach resistance skills to teenagers and reinforce the social
desirability of not using drugs. The program is followed-up with
a five-session booster course the following school year. This
program, in a five-year follow-up study, has been proven
effective in reducing the rate of tobacco, marijuana, and alcohol
use by 20% to 40% and cocaine use by 50%. </p>

<h5>c. Project Healthy Choices </h5>

<p>This program, geared towards sixth and seventh graders,
integrates discussions about drugs and alcohol into the everyday
curriculum by training teachers to incorporate the discussion of
drugs and alcohol into their teaching of academic subjects. This
program is currently implemented in approximately one hundred New
York City schools. It is believed that this approach will
reinforce prevention messages as the students will hear this
discussion as part of their learning on a wide variety of
subjects. The long-range effectiveness of this approach has not
yet been determined. </p>

<h5>d. Student Assistance Program </h5>

<p>This program, which has been implemented in junior and senior
high schools in twenty states, offers counseling during the
school day on a voluntary, confidential basis. A study of the
Westchester County, New York school system where the program was
originally implemented showed a significant reduction in alcohol
and marijuana use. More significantly, studies showed that the
rates of drinking and drug use were 30% lower among students at
schools which implemented the SAP program. </p>

<h5>e. Smart Moves </h5>

<p>&quot;Smart Moves&quot; is a program operated out of Boys and
Girls Clubs in the inner-cities where children live in high crime
neighborhoods. By offering after-school prevention programs and
recreational, educational, and vocational activities, this
program attempts to teach children to recognize the pressures to
use drugs and how to develop the verbal and social skills to
resist these pressures. Again, studies have shown that this type
of program can reduce cocaine and crack use and improve school
behavior and parental involvement. </p>

<h5>f. Seattle Social Development Project </h5>

<p>This comprehensive program seeks to strengthen the bond
between children from high crime neighborhoods and their families
and schools. The program provides to parents techniques to
monitor their children better; teachers get better training to
maintain order and resolve conflicts; and children, as in the
other programs, are taught skills to resist peer pressure.
Interestingly, while the program has shown results in deterring
girls from alcohol, tobacco, and drug use, it has not shown
similar effectiveness with boys. </p>

<h5>g. Programs for Children of Addicts </h5>

<p>Finally, a number of cities are attempting to develop
prevention programs geared towards the children of drug addicts.
These programs attempt to teach parents communication and
parenting skills and provide children with support and social
skills. Two such programs are &quot;Strengthening Families,&quot;
which has been implemented in Salt Lake City, Detroit, and Selma,
Alabama, and the &quot;Safe Haven&quot; program in Detroit.
Evaluations of the &quot;Strengthening Families&quot; program
suggest it strengthens family and school relationships and
affects attitudes towards alcohol and tobacco use. </p>

<p>This provides a summary of the types of successful programs
already available in the communities. Their success depends upon
a school and community commitment to implementing comprehensive
programs geared towards preventing drug use by children. The
diversity of the structure of the programs illustrates the
complexity of the problem. In addition to reaching out to the
&quot;average&quot; school age youth and warning them about the
dangers of substance abuse, there are children in high-risk homes
and crime-ridden neighborhoods who need additional support
structures to resist the pressures of drug use. </p>

<h2>III. TOWARD A NEW DRUG POLICY </h2>

<p>Joycelyn Elders, the United States Surgeon General, has
suggested that a study be made of our current drug policies and
perhaps a new drug policy adopted. Despite the Administration's
rejection of her suggestion, public perception is that she may be
right. Our government tried to prohibit alcohol consumption and
found it did not work. As demonstrated in this report, drug
prohibition is also a failure that causes more harm than the drug
use it is purportedly intended to control. The obvious answer is
that we must take the necessary steps towards a new approach to
drug policy. </p>

<p>Several different alternatives to drug prohibition are being
discussed. Federal District Judge Whitman Knapp suggests that
Congress should repeal all federal laws banning drug sales or
possession and permit states to devise alternatives to
prohibition. This is the present approach to alcohol in the
United States since the repeal of the 18th Amendment and the
Volstead Act. Federal District Judge Jack Weinstein suggests
&quot;standing down&quot; and making fewer arrests, having fewer
prosecutions, and spending more money on treatment. M.A.R.
Kleiman of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard suggests
as a solution to the drug problem a &quot;grudging
toleration&quot; allowing for sale of certain drugs through
state-regulated stores, but the strategy would be to discourage
consumption. </p>

<p>These and other alternatives to drug prohibition should be
thoroughly considered so that our society may choose a new
approach that will avoid the widespread evils caused by the
current drug laws. Any alternative to drug prohibition should
allow continued criminal sanctions against conduct affecting
others (the most obvious example being operating a vehicle while
under the influence). </p>

<p>It is the Committee's belief that a new approach to drug
policy should leave state and local governments free to employ
the full panoply of coercive penal sanctions when drug use is
relevant to conduct affecting others. For instance, as mentioned
above, operating any vehicle while under the influence of drugs
is not tolerated and that should not change. Although in New
York, voluntary intoxication remains relevant to negate specific
intent, the Legislature may wish to restore individual liability
in this area and make any intoxication that is voluntary
irrelevant as to mitigation, on the theory that by this voluntary
act the actor will be held responsible for the consequences of
his conduct while under the influence. Such a sanction is hardly
unreasonable, nor would it strike anyone as being unfair,
especially if facilities to deal with cases of actual addiction
were readily available. </p>

<p>Finally, any alternative to drug prohibition should not
preclude state and local governments from addressing
&quot;quality of life&quot; issues. Government should not be
powerless to control persons who are obviously and publicly
intoxicated. Through enforcement of the existing laws dealing
with public behavior, or appropriate amendments to such laws to
include specific conduct, government intervention would have
greater effect and would be readily accepted as appropriate by
the overwhelming majority of the population. </p>

<h2>IV. CONCLUSION </h2>

<p>The Special Committee on Drugs and the Law has spent the
better part of a decade examining this country's &quot;drug
problem&quot; and the mechanisms utilized to manage it,
principally a federal and state system of criminal proscription. </p>

<p>In recent years, the criminal penalties for possession and
distribution of proscribed drugs have increased, with mandatory
sentences being imposed at both the state and federal levels. The
prison population in the United States has more than doubled in
the past ten years, largely as the result of these prohibitionist
laws. The scarce resources of the federal and state judiciary
have been increasingly devoted to drug cases. </p>

<p>Despite all of these efforts, the drug war rages on. The
Committee recognizes the urgent and compelling need to make
additional resources available for education and treatment. We
believe that even at increased levels, however, treatment and
education are not enough to control this country's drug problem.
The Committee opposes the present prohibitionist system and
recommends the opening of a public dialog regarding new
approaches to drug policy, including legalization and regulation.

<p>SEPARATE STATEMENT TO A REPORT OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p>DRUGS AND THE LAW ENTITLED &quot;A WISER COURSE: ENDING DRUG
PROHIBITION&quot; </p>

<p>We are in agreement with the Report insofar as it calls for
the opening of a public dialog regarding new approaches to drug
policy but disagree with its conclusion that drug prohibition
should be ended. Our disagreement is based upon our concern that
the legal sale of drugs would increase substantially the number
of persons who use and/or become addicted to drugs, causing harm
not only to themselves but to society. Such harm would, in our
view, outweigh the benefits of eliminating drug prohibition. </p>

<p>1. Legalizing Drugs Would Reduce Their Cost to the Public,
Thereby Increasing Demand, Use and Addiction </p>

<p>The theory of drug legalization is that it would take the
profit motive out of illegal drug dealing, eliminating the evils
of drug prohibition. In order to accomplish this result drugs
would have to be sold at prices lower than their present illicit
levels. Many commentators have reached the conclusion that lower
prices would increase the demand for drugs. In Searching For
Alternatives - Drug-Control Policy in the United States, Edited
and With Introduction by Melvyn B. Krauss and Edward P. Lazear,
Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, Stanford,
California (1991), the authors have compiled commentar- ies from
both proponents and opponents of drug legalization, most of whom
acknowledged that lessening cost and increasing access may create
higher drug use. See, e.g., id. at 22-25; 83; 107. </p>

<p>2. The Report Fails to Provide a Concrete Proposal </p>

<p>The Report states that &quot;The Committee opposes the present
prohibitionist system . . . .&quot; However the Report provides
no concrete proposal that would permit us to determine whether
any net benefit to society would result from legaliza- tion.
Should we endorse either (i) the legal sale of crack,
amphetamines, hallucinogens and similar dangerous drugs or (ii)
the sale of drugs to minors? Certainly, if we accept the propo-
sition advanced by many commentators that the legal sale of
drugs, at lower prices than the prices of illegal drugs, would
greatly widen demand, we should reject the proposal that such
harmful substances as those mentioned above be legally sold or
that any drugs be sold to minors. On the other hand, prohibition
of sale of those substances, or of drugs generally to minors,
would give illegal drug traffickers a continuing opportunity to
exploit these markets, and thus by definition the proposal would
not end the evils of drug prohibition. </p>

<p>The Report's failure to provide a specific proposal leaves
these critical issues unresolved. We agree with the Report's
statement that &quot;These and other alternatives [types of
legalization proposals] should be thoroughly considered so that
our society may choose a new approach that will avoid the wide-
spread evils caused by the current drug laws.&quot; A simple end
to drug prohibition, however, cannot be accepted as a solution to
these evils, because the &quot;solution&quot; would produce
greater social harm than the present system. </p>

<p>3. The Report Does Not Set Forth Any Convincing Basis for Its
Conclusion That &quot;Use in Continued Moderation&quot; Would Be
The &quot;Much More Likely Result of Decriminalization&quot; </p>

<p>The Report states that &quot;the available evidence does not
support [the] assumption&quot; that the current prohibitionist
laws discourage many people from using drugs, citing: rising
levels of drug use, arrests and seizures; recent declines in
alcohol and tobacco consumption; the role of drug pushers in
boosting demand; a description of Prohibition suggesting no
correlation between prohibition and use; the results of a 1970's
experiment in which 10 states decriminalized possession of small
amounts of marijuana; and a poll taken of the general public. The
Report also cites drug use trends in the Netherlands and England,
where the problems are less severe than in the United States.
Since neither the United States nor any other developed country
has legalized the sale of drugs, there is, of course, no
empirical evidence directly on point. None of the evidence cited
in the Report refutes the strong likelihood that reducing prices
and facilitating access would significantly increase demand for
drugs. </p>

<p>Recent reductions in use of tobacco and alcohol are not
reliable guidelines for legalized drugs because the pleasure-
enhancing and tolerance-producing (i.e., addictive) characteris-
tics of cocaine, crack and heroin are far more powerful than
those of tobacco and alcohol. See, id. at 18, 24, 78. The results
of Prohibition suggests a correlation between prohibition and
use. Alcohol use declined at the outset of Prohibition and then
increased to only 60% to 70% of pre- Prohibition levels.
Immediately after Repeal, alcohol use re- mained the same, but it
increased to pre-Prohibition levels during the next decade. See,
Miron, &quot;Drug Legalization and the Consumption of Drugs: An
Economist's Perspective&quot;, published in Searching For
Alternatives - Drug-Control Policy in the United States, at id.,
pages 74 to 75. </p>

<p>England and the Netherlands both prohibit drug traf- ficking
and have relaxed enforcement only at the level of the consumer or
patient. The experiences in those countries do not provide any
basis for predictions as to the impact of drug legalization in
the United States where there are far higher levels of both
supply and demand of illegal drugs. See id. at 172-188.
Similarly, the ten states where possession of small amounts of
marijuana was decriminalized are not reliable indica- tors
because trafficking and sale continued to be prohibited. </p>

<p>4. The Report is Mistaken in Characterizing Drug Abuse as an
Individual &quot;Right&quot; rather than as a Social Evil </p>

<p>The Report argues that &quot;Ending drug prohibition would
enable the Court and our society to recognize the right of indi-
viduals to alter their consciousness (the most private of mat-
ters) so long as they do not harm others.&quot; Consistent with
this approach, the Report notes that &quot;Any alternative to
drug prohibition shall allow the continued minimal control of
conduct affecting others (the most obvious example being
operating a vehicle while under the influence).&quot; </p>

<p>In characterizing drug abuse as a &quot;right of individu-
als&quot; the Report ignores its social costs, which include
physical damage to babies born of drug using mothers; abuse
and/or neglect by users of parents, offspring, friends and
relatives; death by overdose; teen suicides; homelessness;
drug-induced altered states of consciousness producing violence,
particularly from the use of cocaine and crack; loss of
productivity of drug-using workers; waste of educational
resources used in attempts to teach drug-abusing students; the
ripple effect on the economy from the presence of large numbers
of incapacitated or impaired individu- als; and the enormous cost
of drug treatment programs. See, Commentary by various authors in
Krauss and Lazear, supra, at pages 97-107; 202-206; 227-236. </p>

<p>5. The Report Should Stress the Need to Reduce Demand for
Drugs Without Endorsing Legalization </p>

<p>The Report is enormously thoughtful and comprehensive and
deserves the most serious study. It describes accurately and
completely the importance and effectiveness of harm reduction and
drug treatment programs. For the reasons stated above, however,
the Report should not recommend ending drug prohibition. Because
of the risk of catastrophic social harm from legalization, many
of the most thoughtful recent works on this topic do not recom-
mend this approach. Mathea Falco, in The Making of a Drug-Free
America (1992), cited in the Report, urges against a &quot;bigger
drug war&quot; (emphasis supplied) and that &quot;[w]e need an
entirely differ- ent approach&quot; . . . &quot;one that puts
into practice what we have learned in recent years about reducing
the demand for drugs.&quot; Id. at 191, 201. The author points
out that &quot;. . . law enforce- ment plays an important role,
but it should not be the center- piece of drug policy.&quot; Id.
at 199. In Reckoning Drugs, the Cities, and the American Future
(1993), Elliot Currie, while noting the same evils of drug
prohibition relied upon in the Report, states: </p>

<p>&quot;. . . no one seriously doubts that legalization would
indeed increase availability, and probably lower prices for many
drugs. In turn, increased availability, as we know from the
experience with alcohol, typically leads to increased
consumption, and with it increased social and public health
costs.&quot; </p>

<p>Id. at 187. In Addiction From Biology to Drug Policy (1994),
Dr. Avram Goldstein recommends retaining the present prohibition
on heroin, cocaine and the amphetamines while endorsing a variety
of harm reduction and drug treatment methods aimed at reducing
demand. Id. at 268-285. In Drug Use in America (1994), (Peter J.
Vesturelli, Editor) Prof. Patricia A. Adler recommends a
&quot;middle ground . . . between the extremes of legalizing all
drugs and bearing the costs of the zero tolerance approach.&quot;
Id. at 260. The author endorses the regulated sale of marijuana
with the use of law enforcement savings for anti-drug abuse
programs aimed at heroin and cocaine. Id. at 262. Prof. Nadelmann
has commented, and we agree, that: &quot;Today, studies similar
to that of the Wickesham Commission and the Rockefeller
Foundation report [on prohibition and alcohol-control strategies
respectively] are necessary to any systematic evaluation of drug
prohibition and its alternatives.&quot; Krauss &amp; Lazear,
supra, at 242. </p>

<p>CONCLUSION </p>

<p>For the reasons above stated we agree with the emphasis of the
Report on further public dialog, harm reduction and drug
treatment but disagree with its conclusion that drug prohibition
should be ended. <br>

<h3>Part II Continued</h3>

<h1>The Costs of Prohibition</h1>

<h2>Prohibition Threatens Public Health</h2>

<h3><a name="sd">Spread of Disease</a></h3>

<h4><a name="sn">Sharing Needles</a></h4>

<p><a name="sn">Because the possession of hypodermic needles is
generally illegal, users of injectable drugs routinely share
needles and syringes with one another, often in &quot;shooting
galleries&quot; where dozens of addicts may line up to use a
single needle rented out by the dealers and not sterilized
between uses. This sharing of needles has become a </a><a
href="footnotes4.htm#126">major source of transmission</a> of
blood-borne diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(&quot;AIDS&quot;) and hepatitis. According to a recent national
review, &quot;more than <a href="footnotes4.htm#127">33% of new
AIDS cases</a> occur among injecting drug users or people having
sexual contact with them.&quot; In New York State, the majority
of new AIDS cases since 1988 have been reported among users of
injectable drugs and their sexual partners. Both the Centers for
Disease Control and the New York State Department of Health have
estimated that more than <a href="footnotes4.htm#128">75% of
pediatric AIDS cases</a> are children whose mothers either
injected drugs or were the sexual partners of persons who
injected drugs. The data suggest, at the very least, that sterile
hypodermic needles should be readily and freely available to drug
users. So long as drug use remains unlawful, however, <a
href="footnotes4.htm#129">free needle distribution</a> is not
likely to attract a substantial portion of the user population.
In response, some <a href="footnotes4.htm#130">courts have
circumscribed laws</a> dealing with the unlawful possession of
hypodermic needles by applying defenses of medical necessity.</p>

<h4><a name="tsd">Trading Sex for Drugs</a></h4>

<p><a name="tsd">Because illicit drugs are expensive, many
addicts turn to </a><a href="footnotes4.htm#131">prostitution</a>
to make money to support their habits, or exchange sexual
services directly for drugs. Prostitute drug addicts often do not
protect themselves from contracting <a href="footnotes4.htm#132">sexually
transmitted diseases</a> carried by their customers, and they
pass such diseases on to other customers, their lovers, and their
children. The crack epidemic, in particular, has been blamed for
the recently noted resurgence of syphilis and other sexually
transmitted diseases. Dr. Robert Rolfs of the Centers for Disease
Control placed the blame squarely on cocaine and its high cost: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>People---especially women---have high-risk sex and
    practice prostitution to support their habits. And it is
    occurring in a relatively poor population where people have a
    lot of things that prevent their access to treatment.
    Therefore, they stay infected longer and are more likely to
    pass their infections on to others. <a
    href="footnotes4.htm#133">[133]</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fewer addicts would be forced to resort to prostitution if the
current prohibitions against drugs were lifted.</p>

<h4><a name="nh">Neglect of Health</a></h4>

<p><a name="nh">Because of addicts' preoccupation with obtaining
and using drugs, and the debilitating effects of some of the
drugs themselves, many addicts are in very poor health. </a><a
href="footnotes4.htm#134">Malnutrition</a> is a frequent problem
and, in turn, contributes to many others. Addicts' poor health
makes them especially susceptible to diseases ranging from scurvy
and shingles to tuberculosis and the flu. Addicts are also more
likely to contract communicable diseases and therefore more
likely to spread them. The interrelated urban problems of
homelessness and illegal drug abuse have contributed to the
development of <a href="footnotes4.htm#135">multi-drug-resistant
strains of diseases</a> such as tuberculosis, which was once
thought to be on the verge of eradication. These more virulent
diseases know few geographical limitations and pose risks to the
general population.</p>

<h4><a name="ahcs">Avoidance of the Health-Care System</a></h4>

<p><a name="ahcs">Individuals who use illegal drugs often put off
addressing their health problems for fear of prosecution or other
</a><a href="footnotes4.htm#136">adverse consequences</a> (<i>e.g.</i>,
rebuffs by doctors, loss of job). This reluctance to seek medical
care is compounded by the fact that many drug addicts have no
private physicians and rely instead on public hospitals or
clinics for any care they might get.</p>

<p>Prohibition, therefore, has perverse results on health; drug
abusers tend to enter the health-care system only if and when
their need for care is acute, which is also when care is most
costly to deliver. If, for example, a woman avoids pre-natal
care, she may give birth to a baby with low birth weight and
other medical difficulties. If a drug abuser puts off seeking
treatment for illnesses and injuries, he or she may end up in the
<a href="footnotes4.htm#137">emergency room</a> and the intensive
care ward.</p>

<p>Mothers and pregnant women face the additional and justifiable
fear that any detectable drug use may be reported as a possible
indication of child abuse or neglect. In many large city
hospitals, the urine of newborn babies is tested for prohibited
drugs, and mothers whose babies test positive for pre-natal
exposure are reported to the child abuse authorities. Until
recently, in New York City, such babies were routinely kept from
their mothers pending investigations that often lasted many
months, interfering with normal bonding and necessarily adversely
affecting the infant's development and relationship with the
parent. Moreover, these women have, in some jurisdictions, been <a
href="footnotes4.htm#138">prosecuted for pre-partum distribution</a>
of prohibited drugs.</p>

<p>In addition to the obvious costs to the individuals who become
infected with catastrophic illnesses directly through drug use,
and the high costs to the health care system of treating them,
prohibition contributes to the spread of such diseases throughout
society, particularly to the sexual partners and children of
infected drug users. Left untreated, users and addicts are more
likely to give birth to unhealthy children, to abuse or neglect
their children after they are born, or to have their <a
href="footnotes4.htm#139">children</a> placed in foster care.</p>

<h3><a name="liqc">Lack of Information and Quality Control</a></h3>

<h4><a name="addddup">Adulterated Drugs, Designer Drugs, and
Drugs of Unknown Potency</a></h4>

<p><a name="addddup">Because drugs are manufactured and
distributed in secret, it is impossible for users to guard
against adulteration or to determine the purity and potency of
the drugs they use. The problem is compounded by drug growers,
manufacturers, and distributors who, to minimize the risks of
apprehension, develop and purvey the drug varieties that pack the
most intoxicating effect into the smallest package. According to
an experienced New York City researcher, </a></p>

    <p><a name="addddup">The fact that cocaine, heroin and
    related drugs are illegal encourages the use of injection.
    Severe statutory restrictions greatly increase the cost of
    illicit substances to nonmedical users. Injecting provides a
    way to economize. Injectable forms of opiates and coca are
    much more concentrated than traditional forms, such as opium
    or coca tea. Injection provides an intense and economical
    effect by maximizing the amount of drug that reaches the
    brain. People who sniff or smoke drugs say that if they
    inject they need only one third of the amount of the drug to
    maintain a habit. </a></p>
    <p><a name="addddup">Because the injection forms of illicit
    drugs are concentrated, they are [also] relatively easier to
    ship. </a><a href="footnotes4.htm#140">[140]</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has been demonstrated that, as law enforcement and criminal
penalties intensify, dealers also find other ways to economize by
inventing new drugs---so-called &quot;designer drugs&quot;---that
are not yet prohibited. This places the ill-informed consumers of
such drugs at greater risk of overdose and other health problems.
Illnesses and deaths have resulted from (1) the introduction of
dangerous substances into drugs that could otherwise have been
used with greater safety, (2) inadvertent overdoses due to
variations in potency, and (3) the development of &quot;designer
drugs&quot; intended to give the effect of familiar intoxicants
with new chemical compositions that put them <a
href="footnotes4.htm#141">beyond the reach of current laws</a>.
Just as the prohibition against alcohol led to sales of poisonous
wood alcohol and the prohibition against abortion led to
coat-hanger abortions, the prohibition against drug manufacture,
sale, and possession results in <a href="footnotes4.htm#142">unnecessary
deaths</a> due to adulteration, variable purity, and
&quot;designer drugs.&quot; This contrasts sharply with the
government's current regulation of alcoholic beverages, which
ensures that the beverages are pure and that buyers know how
strong they are and what some of their health effects may be.
Experts have noted that heightened efforts to enforce drug laws
and amend them to encompass new formulations or ban precursor
substances may only <a href="footnotes4.htm#143">push dealers to
take greater risks</a>, selling ever more potentially dangerous
substances.</p>

<h4><a name="lkasu">Lack of Knowledge About Safer Use</a></h4>

<p><a name="lkasu">Because many drugs are outlawed, individuals
considering drug use rarely have access to accurate information
about the effects of drugs. While a cautious user may err on the
side of avoiding certain activities while under the use of drugs,
he or she may have no way of knowing, beyond trial and error, the
possible adverse health consequences of certain combinations of
drugs and his or her individual tolerance for particular
substances. Because of its penchant for exaggeration and
cartoonish treatment of the issues, most current education about
drugs is not taken seriously by young people. As a result, it is
far less effective than other health education (e.g., about
nutrition, fitness, and smoking cigarettes).</a></p>

<h4><a name="uatisd">Using Alcohol and Tobacco Instead of
&quot;Soft Drugs&quot;</a></h4>

<p><a href="footnotes4.htm#144">Alcohol and tobacco</a> are
completely legal yet do much more harm, statistically speaking,
than illegal drug use. It is also generally recognized that
alcohol, at least when used to excess, can cause <a
href="footnotes4.htm#145">aggressive, anti-social behavior</a>.
The current prohibitionist laws against marijuana, generally
considered an &quot;a-motivational&quot; drug, and other
so-called &quot;soft drugs&quot; have the effect of influencing
some people to choose alcohol over these &quot;soft drugs.&quot;
Peter Reuter, an economist at the Rand Corporation, concludes
that &quot;If marijuana is a substitute for alcohol..., alcohol
is, by definition, a substitute for marijuana. Thus tough <a
href="footnotes4.htm#146">marijuana enforcement must increase
drinking</a>.&quot; Similarly, Frank Chaloupka, an economist at
the University of Illinois, found through statistical analysis
&quot;that states without criminal sanctions against marijuana
possession suffered <a href="footnotes4.htm#147">fewer auto
fatalities</a>.&quot; Finally, Karen Model, a Ph.D. candidate at
Harvard, found that &quot;states decriminalizing marijuana
reported <a href="footnotes4.htm#148">lower overall rates of
drug- and alcohol-related emergencies</a>.&quot; To the extent
that users are choosing alcohol rather than marijuana or other
&quot;soft drugs,&quot; the overall public health effects are
probably worse than they would be otherwise.</p>

<h3><a name="idv">Injuries Due to Violence</a></h3>

<p><a name="idv">The high prices commanded by prohibited drugs
create competition among groups and individuals willing to break
the law to supply drugs to consumers. Their competition often
becomes violent and has contributed to the build-up of arms and
the </a><a href="footnotes4.htm#149">pervasiveness of violence</a>
in many areas. Gunshot wounds and other traumas due to the
illegal drug business have become commonplace in big-city
hospital emergency rooms. Not only traffickers, but also law
enforcement officers and innocent bystanders are often the <a
href="footnotes4.htm#150">victims</a>. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
recently noted:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The victims of the [ ] gun battles [of street-level drug
    dealers] are innocent bystanders---and often young children.
    Last year alone, about 500 New York City children were shot;
    of these, 89 were innocent bystanders hit by crossfire. <a
    href="footnotes4.htm#151">[151]</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cost of prohibiting drugs must be measured in terms of
lost lives and expensive medical care and include the hidden
costs of lost productivity and the psychological damage to
individuals and entire communities living in fear, helpless and
hopeless.</p>

<p>With the possible exceptions of cocaine and PCP, <a
href="footnotes4.htm#152">drugs themselves do not generally cause
violent behavior</a>. It is, instead, turf wars for the control
of black markets and the drug users' need for money to purchase
such substances that leads to violence. Indeed, marijuana and
heroin have been shown to render their users disinclined to
violence or incapable of violence while under the influence.
These substances are <a href="footnotes4.htm#153">much less
dangerous</a> in this regard than alcohol.</p>

<h3><a name="drtp">Diversion of Resources from Treatment and
Prevention</a></h3>

<p><a href="footnotes4.htm#154">Prohibition diverts money</a>
that could otherwise be used for preventing and treating drug
abuse. Federal anti-drug legislation provides a single budget for
&quot;supply reduction&quot; and &quot;demand reduction&quot;
efforts. Law enforcement agencies have always received much more
than prevention, treatment, and research programs combined. The
ABA recently reported that &quot;[s]ince the early 1980s,
treatment has been a declining priority. In 1991, treatment
received 14% of the $10.5 billion federal drug budget compared to
25% ten years earlier.&quot; During the same period,
&quot;federal <a href="footnotes4.htm#155">spending on law
enforcement increased 737%</a>, with interdiction efforts leading
the increase.&quot; Ending drug prohibition would, by definition,
eliminate the need for any special law enforcement funds for drug
interdiction. It would also allow for the redirection of law
enforcement resources to concentrate on violent crime and quality
of life issues.</p>

<h1>A Summary of M.K. Gandhi's Technique for Political Action </h1>

<p> <b>By Mary Sibley</b> </p>

<p> February 1995 </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>PREFACE </h2>

<p> I have prepared this description of the political action
technique of M.K. Gandhi at the request of Dave Hall for
distribution to the DrugReform Coordination Network (DRCNet) and
other drug policy reform advocates who may have an interest in
Gandhi's technique. I have read much about Gandhi's technique and
know that I still do not fully comprehend its application and
implications. My knowledge is especially scanty in the area of
organizational structures through which Gandhian campaigns were
conducted, although I surmise that Gandhi's campaign
organizations were highly structured. I am currently seeking
texts describing and analyzing Gandhi's organizational
structures. If anyone has such a text, I would appreciate access
to it. If anyone has studied Gandhi's life and work and reads
something within this that seems to be wrong, misleading, or a
misinterpretation, I would welcome suggestions. In addition, I
would be glad to participate in further discussion. </p>

<h2>CREDITS </h2>

<p> For assistance in organizing my thoughts, I give credit to
Joan V. Bondurant, whose book &quot;Conquest of Violence: The
Gandhian Philosophy of Conflict&quot; (second edition, 1965,
Princeton University Press) I consulted occasionally while
writing this. In the text that follows, annotations are sparse.
If anyone is interested in reading more about a particular topic,
let me know and I will provide references. INTRODUCTION </p>

<h2>How this Discussion Is Organized </h2>

<p> This discussion is organized into three sections. The first
section discusses the cultural context and other conditions under
which Gandhi conceived and conducted political campaigns. The
second section discusses the fundamental principles of a Gandhian
campaign. The last section discusses the steps in a Gandhian
campaign and includes my opinions about the similarities between
these steps and steps that have been taken by drug policy reform
advocates. A Short Definition of Gandhi's Political Technique
Gandhi's political technique is a process of creatively engaging
with others to transform an unjust cultural, economic, social, or
governmental system into one that is more just. Scope of Gandhi's
Technique Gandhi is most famous for his political activism with
respect to ending British rule in India. He used the technique
not just to work toward reform and ultimately removal of British
rule in India, but also in many conflict situations between
Indians only. For example, he organized and led programs designed
to change how the upper class Hindus treated the lower class
Hindus. Gandhi himself considered his most important work the
constructive programs designed to remove the underlying causes of
poverty and to rebuild strong local economies in impoverished
areas. Without this work, poor Indians would not have had the
sustenance needed to participate in the many campaigns that led
to home rule. Martin Luther King applied techniques similar to
Gandhi's in the United States when working to end civil rights
injustices based on race. Many of King's programs, speeches, and
writings strongly resemble Gandhi's, with terminology and other
specifics tailored to the issues and systems at hand. Another
20th century leader who has successfully used similar techniques
when engaging a cruel and conscience-less government is Vaclav
Havel. The injustices that these leaders were working to overcome
occurred in widely varying cultures, social systems, and
governments. Because I assume that most readers are specifically
interested in political strategies with regard to changing unjust
laws in the U.S., the following discussion focuses on the
application of Gandhi's techniques in conflicts with governments.
</p>

<h2>SECTION 1. CONTEXT AND CONDITIONS </h2>

<h3>The Cultural Context in which Gandhi Developed His Techniques
</h3>

<p> India is multi-cultural with most cultures based on
religions. The Hindus are the largest group, followed by the
Muslims, who constitute a large minority. Then come a much
smaller number of Sikhs. Many other religious groups exist, but
they are very small in numbers. People of these religions had
lived side-by-side in relative peace for thousands of years when
the British arrived. As the British became established
economically, they started an insidious campaign to divide the
Indian people along religious lines, especially by planting in
Muslims fear of discrimination from Hindus should the British not
keep the Hindu influence in check. The British were quite
successful in promoting disunity between the Hindus and Muslims,
a legacy that to this day engenders hatred and bloodshed. The
Sikhs were selected to be the native component of the
British-controlled police force. The Sikhs were a large enough
minority to provide enough police for British purposes, and yet a
small enough group that Sikh police were patrolling and
incarcerating primarily Hindus and Muslims. After a couple of
hundred years of British encroachment on the cultures,
inter-cultural fear and suspicion that had not existed before the
British became the norm. </p>

<h3>Gandhi's Starting Place in Society </h3>

<p> Gandhi was born a Hindu. The Hindu society is stratified
(some say &quot;calcified&quot;) into classes referred to as
castes. The caste into which one is born determines the jobs one
may have, the education one may pursue, the privileges one is
allowed, the places one may gather water, the people with whom
one may eat, etc. The highest caste is the Brahmans; the lowest,
the untouchables. Outside of these are the outcastes. The
outcastes are those who violated the rules of their caste to the
extent that the authorities within the caste cast them out.
Thereafter, they are to be shunned by others in the caste--no one
may help them, they are not allowed to work within the caste,
etc. Gandhi was a member of the Bania caste, which participated
in business and government in his home state. Gandhi was publicly
ordered an outcaste when he was in his late teens because he went
to Britain to study law; his caste's leaders said it was against
the religion to leave the country. The leaders actually went so
far as to inform the caste members that if they saw him off when
he left for England, they would be fined! Gandhi wrote in his
autobiography, &quot;The order had no effect on me, and I took my
leave . . .&quot; ( M.K. Gandhi, &quot;An Autobiography: The
Story of My Experiments with the Truth,&quot; Part I, Chapter
XII, [1927] translation by Mahadev Desai, published in the U.S.
in 1957 by Beacon Press, Boston). </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>SECTION 2. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES </h2>

<p> Gandhi adhered to four fundamental principles familiar to the
Westerner. Three are truth, non-violence, and self-suffering. The
fourth is concerned with means and ends. All campaigns conducted
under his guidance were consistent with these principles
(occasional errors arose due to the experimental nature of the
technique and limitations in campaigners' previous experience).
These fundamental principles are summarized below. </p>

<h3>Truth </h3>

<p> Gandhi did not fully define the &quot;truth&quot; but instead
said that he was seeking after it. He was seeking after it
through socio-political action, just as others might seek after
it through a mystical or spiritual path, the study of
mathematics, or the creation of art. I gather from my readings
that the goals of most his contemporaries were much more
immediate and concrete (like a cost-of-living increase for
workers in a textile mill, the right for untouchables to walk
past a temple used by Brahmans, the replacement of British rule
with home rule, etc.). The replacement of British rule was a
mighty goal. Those who held it accepted the need for a large
number of intermediate goals that they collectively agreed (often
after long and arduous debate) would contribute directly or
indirectly to achievement of the mighty goal. Some of the
intermediate goals included things that even the most uneducated,
illiterate, and impoverished could grasp immediately, like: (1)
Having all Indians weave their own cloth rather than buy British
cloth (most Indians made their own clothing) and (2) Repealing a
salt taxation and regulation scheme that drove the cost of salt
so high that the poor could not afford it. Salt is an essential
dietary element in India's climate and can be collected from
India's ocean beaches or retrieved from inland deposits by anyone
after a bit of instruction. The salt laws brought the British
significant revenues. Enforcement of the salt laws included fines
and incarceration for those who were caught making or collecting
salt for personal use and most especially if the person was
producing and distributing marketable amounts outside of the
government's regulatory structure. </p>

<h3>Non-Violence </h3>

<p> Gandhi maintained that no human or group of humans could know
the complete truth. No matter how close one thinks one might be
to the truth, one could be in error either wholly or in some
lesser way that is not immediately apparent. Because of this, he
maintained that no one could use violence toward others to press
his or her view of the truth forward. This principle excluded all
acts of violence, and Gandhi's definition of violence was broad.
As one might expect, physical violence could not be used against
an opponent. He also maintained that there should be no violence
in one's expression and words. The non-violence principle
required that an opponent be treated with utmost respect. Smear
campaigns aimed at defamation of character were not in his
political action toolbox, just as murder of lawmakers, judges,
bureaucrats, and police were not in his toolbox. Gandhi's
non-violence is a full antonym for violence. Not only does
non-violence refrain from destructive acts, it is aggressively
and provocatively constructive. Thus, Gandhi's campaigns did not
seek to defeat an opponent, but instead to convert the opponent
to a more just position and to challenge the opponent to act upon
the new position. In addition, Gandhi held that there must be an
opportunity for an opponent to save face, so long as no
fundamental principle or aim of the action was thereby
compromised. </p>

<h3>Self-Suffering </h3>

<p> Self-suffering is an integral element of Gandhi's technique
and a necessary corollary to provocative non-violent action.
Self-suffering can take the form of material and social
sacrifice. For example, loss of employment, property, or income
as a result of holding to one's view of the truth is a form of
self-suffering. Self-suffering reaches its personal extremes in
incarceration, physical injury, and the sacrifice of one's life.
Gandhi wrote: &quot;Suffering injury in one's own person is . . .
of the essence of non-violence and is the chosen substitute for
violence to others.&quot; (M.K. Gandhi, &quot;Non-violence in
Peace and War,&quot; 2nd edition, Ahmedabad: Navajivan, 1944, p.
49). He also wrote, &quot;Non-violence in its dynamic condition
means conscious suffering. It does not mean meek submission to
the will of the evil-doer, but it means the pitting of one's
whole soul against the will of the tyrant.&quot; (M.K. Gandhi, in
&quot;Young India,&quot; August 11, 1920 ). Self-suffering is
preferred over submitting to humiliation and pr ovides a way to
preserve one's personal dignity in the face of those who would
treat one unjustly. Throughout his writings and campaigns, Gandhi
emphasized that inviting self-suffering is something that must
not be done lightly. One who invites self-suffering must be
prepared for the fullest possible sacrifice that may result from
one's actions. </p>

<h3>Means and Ends </h3>

<p> Gandhi believed that means do not serve ends, rather means
create ends. Thus, to attain an end that is positive and
truthful, one must use means that are positive and truthful. This
philosophy can be summarized by his statement, &quot;the means
are the ends in the making.&quot; Means that create ends have two
interesting implications. First, one cannot define a just,
non-violent end and then use unjust and violent means to attain
it--for the end will be in character with the means used. This
view precludes taking actions under the philosophy summarized in
the statement &quot;the ends justify the means&quot;--a
philosophy that seems to permeate current U.S. policy-making.
Indeed, the &quot;ends&quot; being created by current government
policy with regard to some drugs are very different than the
officially stated goals. </p>

<p> A second implication is that, while one must always be moving
toward a goal of pure truth and justice, the end cannot be
defined precisely in advance. Each action one takes creates the
next action and that one, the next, each action always in keeping
with the last and moving progressively closer to truth and
justice. Through actively engaging with fellow activists and the
opponent, one grows in understanding of what must be done, a step
at a time, to create the most just and truthful end. </p>

<p> The technique becomes dynamic when it succeeds in provoking
internal change in the opponent. Thus the knowledge and
understanding of both the activist and the opponent grow
simultaneously toward truth and justice. However, the technique
is not self-propelling; it is usually used in a context of a
stagnant, inert, or deliberately destructive force and requires
tremendous energy. The activist must constantly reassess the
opponent's comprehension and adjust the program so that it is
more than reactive to the opponent's change--every change must be
viewed as an opportunity to press the campaign further forward. </p>

<h3>What Gandhi's Contemporaries Thought About the Fundamental
Principles </h3>

<p> A few of Gandhi's contemporaries adhered to the fundamental
principles as inviolable guides by which to conduct one's
personal life as well as one's social or political actions.
However, the majority of his contemporaries accepted the
fundamental principles as policies. They recognized the success
of the principles in empowering the disempowered and realized
that, even if viewed as policies, the principles were the key to
winning &quot;home rule&quot; with an unarmed and impoverished
army of the disenfranchised. </p>

<p> This acceptance as policy rather than principle caused Gandhi
some dismay. When the activists with whom he was working rejected
these even as policy, he would leave the political sphere and
return to his constructive work toward remedying the devastating
economic problems in the villages of India. Eventually, his
contemporaries always asked him to return to the political
sphere. </p>

<h2>SECTION 3. STEPS OF A GANDHIAN CAMPAIGN </h2>

<h3>The Progress of a Campaign </h3>

<p> Upon discovering an opportunity for reform or change, a
campaign is conducted through several steps. Each step is a
necessary prerequisite to the next, for each must fully develop
the context in which the next occurs. The early steps develop the
public stage upon which later steps, if they become necessary,
can be played out. Some of the steps initiated early in the
campaign, especially education, continue throughout the campaign.
The progression is designed to maximize early in the campaign all
opportunities for the opponent to make positive changes and save
face without campaigners moving to more provocative measures. The
careful progression provides fullest opportunity for the
campaigners to adjust their position if they discover that they
have inadvertently violated a fundamental principle. It gives
campaign leaders the opportunity, through engaging with the
opponent early in relatively low-risk situations, to
realistically assess their own strengths and weaknesses and those
of the campaigners and to determine what more provocative steps
can and cannot be taken successfully. </p>

<p> A Summary of the Steps of a Gandhian Campaign </p>

<p> The steps of a campaign are: </p>

<p> -- Investigation of the facts, situation, and conditions </p>

<p> -- Education of the campaigners, the public, and the opponent
</p>

<p> -- Negotiation and arbitration </p>

<p> -- Preparation of the campaigners for more provocative
measures </p>

<p> -- Agitation </p>

<p> -- Issuing of an ultimatum </p>

<p> -- Economic boycott and forms of strike </p>

<p> -- Non-cooperation </p>

<p> -- Civil disobedience </p>

<p> -- Creation of alternate structures </p>

<p> In India, these steps eventually led to the establishment of
a parallel government in some places, which provided Indians with
some of the experience needed to assume self-government when
British rule was removed. </p>

<p> The steps of a campaign are described in the paragraphs
below. In brackets I have mentioned my current opinion of where
drug policy reform advocates have made the most progress.
Investigation of the Facts, Situation, and Conditions A Gandhian
campaign is founded on an objective assessment of the facts. All
facts are considered; none are rejected or downplayed if they do
not fit the expectations of the campaigners--to do so would be to
move away from the complete truth. The situation of campaigners
and those experiencing the injustice are examined. As full an
understanding of the situation as possible is developed among all
involved. The conditions at the time--public awareness and
opinion, the situation of the opponent, and other relevant
factors are all considered and weighed. </p>

<p> [Drug policy reform advocates seem to me to be strongest
here. The only difficulty I've seen is the occasional attempt to
reject or downplay a pertinent fact that doesn't quite
&quot;fit,&quot; but this is usually remedied through discussion
among reform advocates.] </p>

<h3>Education of the Campaigners, the Public, and the Opponent </h3>

<p> With the facts in hand and the situation and conditions fully
examined, education begins. All who join the campaign must be
educated; they become representatives through their association
and must be fully informed. The public is often unaware of or
misinformed about injustices; they must be educated to understand
why change is needed. Many opponents are similar to the
public--they are unaware or misinformed. Gandhi felt that there
were only a few pponents who would actually want injustices to be
perpetuated or continue. Gandhi was an optimist and believed even
those few could be converted. [Drug policy reform advocates are
weak here, but getting stronger. At the International Conference
for Drug Policy Reform last November, attendees recognized the
need to raise public awareness about injustices of the drug war.
I understand that organizations like NORML are following up with
activities geared toward education of the general public. The
Washington Hemp Education Network (W.H.E.N.) was started by a
group of marijuana policy reform activists in Washington State
who recognized the need for education. My personal experience has
been that many of the people who join W.H.E.N. recognize the
injustices and are looking for the facts. Others join because
they have much knowledge and want opportunities to educate and
persuade others. Some relish entering the opponents' sphere and
educating! Also, Cliff Schaffer's persuasive strategies provide
an excellent example of guidelines that have been tailored to
move the opponent toward the truth given an opponent's entry
position in a discussion. Such guidelines must be assessed and
modified periodically to ensure that they keep pace with the
inevitable progress the opponents will make when so persuaded.] </p>

<h3>Negotiation and Arbitration </h3>

<p> Remedy for the injustice is sought first through established
channels within the existing system. Petitioning for change of
unjust laws, challenging unjust laws in the courts, and other
legislative or legal methods fall under this step. </p>

<p> [Drug policy reform advocates working on reform of marijuana
laws have done plenty of negotiation and arbitration at the
federal level and in many states. I am not aware of as high of a
level of negotiation effort for substances like heroin, cocaine,
etc.] </p>

<h3>Preparation of the Campaigners for More Provocative Measures </h3>

<p> Immediately upon recognizing the existence of a conflict
situation that might lead to more provocative measures, Gandhi's
technique calls for intense preparation. The motives of
campaigners are examined, weaknesses of the group are identified,
and exercises in self-discipline undertaken. The goal of this
step is to assess and develop the campaigners' ability to adhere
to fundamental principles and to continue action in the face of
significant risks. There is much discussion of the issues at
hand, the current situation and conditions, and of the potential
results of various courses of action. [I have not heard of drug
policy reform advocates undertaking such self-examination and
participating in mutually agreed upon exercises in
self-discipline. I have heard discussions and analyses about
potential actions that fall under subsequent steps.] </p>

<h3>Agitation </h3>

<p> Agitation includes legal high-profile activities such as
rallies and picketing. Such events are opportunities for the
leaders to assess the group's readiness to proceed with higher
profile and more difficult steps without deteriorating into
violence. Mass gatherings also provide an opportunity to begin
instructing campaigners who have not been trained previously in
the fundamental principles, to communicate developments in the
campaign, and to explain the next step. </p>

<p> [I haven't heard much about this kind of agitation. Agitation
I have heard about has involved small numbers of people and, as
far as I know, it has not been part of a sequence of steps such
as described here. I do not believe that Hemp Fests, even if no
one smoked, would meet the criteria by which Gandhi defined
agitation because they are not part of a highly focused political
campaign and do not have a strong educational focus.] </p>

<h3>Issuing of an Ultimatum </h3>

<p> A strong appeal is made to the opponent. The appeal is quite
explicit. It states the problem, identifies a constructive
solution and the responsibilities of each party in the solution,
and explains what the campaigners will do if the opponent does
not participate in the solution. The ultimatum should include
provision for the opponent to save face within the scope of the
fundamental principles. The opponent is fully informed about the
next step. In fact, from this step forward, every single step
taken is preceded by a full advance disclosure to the opponent of
what will be done, when, and where. Before each step commences,
the opponent is offered the opportunity to change. </p>

<p> [If drug policy reform advocates started a Gandhian campaign
today, I believe that they would be years from being able to
issue ultimatums that actually carried any weight.] </p>

<h3>Economic Boycott and Forms of Strike </h3>

<p> In India, Indians boycotted foreign cloth with such success
that they had a significant impact on the mills in Britain.
Strikes have been used extensively in the U.S. for in all kinds
of reform campaigns A scene in the movie &quot;Gandhi&quot; shows
the power of a nationwide strike. [To conduct an economic boycott
requires economic alternatives for the boycotters. To conduct an
effective strike, a campaign needs great numbers of campaigners
and who have economic alternatives. As far as I can tell, drug
policy reform advocates are generally dependent on the dominant
economic structures and so are weak on this point.] </p>

<h3>Non-Cooperation </h3>

<p> Non-cooperation involves refusal to support the portions of
the system that require reform or accept benefits from the
system. For example, during the campaign to remove British rule,
Indians resigned from government posts, removed their children
from government schools, returned awards and medals that they had
received from the government, and so on. Economic boycott and
strikes described in the previous step can be regarded as forms
of non-cooperation. [The judges who refuse to try drug cases are
engaged in non-cooperation. People who refuse to provide urine
samples as a condition of employment are engaged in
non-cooperation.] </p>

<h3>Civil Disobedience </h3>

<p> Civil disobedience extends non-cooperation to the active and
open breaking of selected laws. Gandhi set complete and voluntary
obedience to laws as a prerequisite for civil disobedience. Laws
to be broken were selected very carefully for their position at
the heart of the problem or for their symbolic value. Civil
disobedience involves a deliberate courting of arrest and, upon
arrest, no defense is offered in the courts. In fact, full
admission of guilt is required. The prosecutors, juries, and
judges are challenged to see the injustice of the law that they
are defending against the civil disobedient and to cease their
cooperation with the injustice. In mass campaigns involving civil
disobedience in India, prisons filled up very quickly. Very
often, the leaders were arrested in an attempt to dishearten the
campaigners and end the campaign. Sometimes they were arrested
upon delivery to the authorities of their notice of intent to
disobey! Other times, the government ignored them completely
which, of course, encouraged more people to join the campaign. If
the government ignores the first civil disobedients, the
provocative nature of increasing numbers of civil disobedients
eventually compels the government to act. And compelling the
opponent to act is the point of civil disobedience. Two important
organizational points must be mentioned here. Every campaign in
which the leaders may be arrested must provide succession of
leadership. A succession procedure must be planned in advance so
that civil disobedience continues apace no matter how many
leaders have been arrested. The second point involves support for
the families of the civil disobedients. There must always be
people who are willing to forego civil disobedience and remain
free to take care of the children, the aged, and the ill. Support
people should be identified in advance and should, under no
circumstances, court arrest. </p>

<p> [Medicinal marijuana suppliers and users come to mind as a
possible example of civil disobedients, although an analysis
would reveal that very few of these civil disobedients actually
meet all of the criteria set forth by Gandhi.] </p>

<h3>Creation of Alternate Structures </h3>

<p> If, after all of these steps, the existing system fails to
become more just, an alternate means of ensuring justice must be
developed. This is especially important when the existing system
is so corrupt that people are disobeying it not just as part of a
campaign, but simply because they find themselves unable to
conduct their lives peacefully without disobeying it. Such a
system is approaching inevitable collapse by virtue of its
inherent flaws. Alternate structures must be built in advance not
only to provide for immediate needs, but also to prevent (or at
least mitigate) the potential release of destructive,
anger-driven energy that often follows an oppressive system's
collapse. [Medicinal marijuana buyers' clubs provide an example
of an alternate structure.] </p>

<h3>Demands of Gandhi's Technique on Campaigners </h3>

<p> Gandhi's technique exacts a great deal from a campaign's
leadership and those who follow them. They must tirelessly plan
and monitor the progress of the campaign, reassess their position
and the position of the opponent, and respond creatively and
provocatively to events as they unfold. Leaders must be flexible
enough to respond to change. </p>

<p> At the same time, they must have the insight to know which
potential responses might lead to stagnation of the campaign or
will compromise a fundamental principle--for either will lead to
setbacks. </p>

<p> Leaders must be consummate communicators: with the opponent,
the public, potential supporters, and those who have joined the
campaign--else misunderstandings and misinterpretations can arise
as the campaign is adjusted to changing conditions and events.
Leaders must have an ability to organize, inspire, and use fully
the talents of an extremely diverse group of people who volunteer
their services to a campaign. People with widely varying
perspectives and beliefs must be transformed from a disorganized
scattering of supporters in conflict not just with the
government, but often with each other, to a coherent, responsive
unit that can target its actions and responses with great force.
Finally, all in the campaign must have an ability to manage or
dispel the tension and anger that can arise when their efforts
appear to be frustrated, when there are disagreements among
campaigners, and when they directly confront an often-hostile
opponent. </p>

<h2>CONCLUSION </h2>

<p> Many drug policy reform advocates have been using political
action techniques similar (though not identical) to the steps
described above. But drug policy reform advocates have not
catalyzed into a dynamic, coherent group that can act
synchronously to achieve a clearly defined goal. I believe that,
if reform advocates' efforts were synthesized in a Gandhian
sequence with an underpinning of the fundamental principles,
success would be inevitable. </p>

Action strategies </p>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">1. Contact
your local media. Tell them about these web pages and the
information on them.<br>
</h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">2. Read
the newspapers and respond. </h2>

<p> Make it a point to read the largest newspapers in your area
and be alert for drug-policy related news stories. Write short,
punchy letters to the editor to make your views heard. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">3. Contact
the talk shows in your area. </h2>

<p> Most TV and radio talk shows need a steady stream of
controversial subjects to make the shows interesting. Sooner or
later, they will all do a show on drug policy. Go through your TV
listings and locate all talk and news shows. Call the stations
and ask for the producers of the show. In most cases, it will
surprise you how easy it is to get through. Tell them about the
resolution and the people supporting it. Let them know that there
are prominent people now willing to come forward and debate this
idea publicly. Producers are probably extremely busy, so keep it
short, punchy, and sweet. Have some juicy &quot;sound bites&quot;
planned to stimulate interest. Follow up with a letter and
printed material such as the things I have enclosed. Keep in
touch with them every ninety days or so, just to make sure that
they don't forget you. </p>

<p> If you get a spot on a good TV show and then don't know what
to do -- call me. We'll work something out. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">4. Develop
a constituency. </h2>

<p> Contact groups and members of groups to put on a presentation
and persuade them to support the resolution. There are all kinds
of groups which may support this resolution, each for their own
individual reasons. They include African-Americans, ministers,
doctors, medical patients, law enforcement officials, AIDS
groups, and many others. Pick groups that you think you can
persuade and then develop the issues which are most important to
them. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">5. Pick
one influential person at a time and persuade them. </h2>

<p> When you have persuaded them that it is time for a change,
and that we should at least look at other drug policy options,
get them to commit to going with you to persuade at least two
more influential people. Use this technique to &quot;move up the
ladder&quot; to more and more influential people. </p>

<p> Use the &quot;intervention group&quot; approach. Assemble a
small group of people whom your target will view as influential
and persuasive. Arrange a meeting where all can attend and have
all those people ask the person to reconsider their point of
view. Don't ask them to support legalization or
decriminalization, because it is unlikely that you could persuade
them in one meeting anyway. Just get them to admit that there is
enough of a question about the issue that it is time to
re-examine the evidence and commit to the investigation of the
possibility of change. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">6. Enlist
your friends to create a steady &quot;rain&quot; of resolutions
on the White House. </h2>

<p> Get everyone to commit to sending a resolution a week. Keep
it up until we get the commission. Let Clinton know that this
resolution is not going to go away. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">7. Develop
phone networks to get people to respond when we need them to
respond. </h2>

<p> The National Rifle Association is powerful because, at any
given time, it can bombard the President and Congress with
millions of letters and phone calls. We need the same type of
response. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">8. Put on
debates and seminars at colleges. </h2>

<p> Colleges and universities often have philosophy, public
administration, law enforcement, or political science professors
who might like to put on a public forum or debate on drug policy.
Call the local colleges and ask for the heads of these
departments, or anyone else you think might be interested.
Suggest the idea to them. </p>

<p> I have enclosed a sample speech from one of the debates I was
in. You can edit it as appropriate to your needs. I have never
had anyone make an intelligent comeback to that speech. </p>

<p> The enclosed charts can be blown up to 18 inch by 24 inch
size by places such as Kinko's Copies for about $2.50 to $5.00
each, depending upon whether you get them on ordinary paper or on
card stock. For large audiences, consider taking 35mm slide
pictures of the graphs. If you are out in the middle of the woods
and can't do either of those things, write to me and, if you pay
for it, I will have it done for you. </p>

<p> The biggest problem you may have with this tactic is that the
local gendarmes and prosecutors are becoming increasingly
reluctant to come out in public and defend the drug war. They
have been getting their butts kicked far too much lately and even
the most fervent drug warriors are now having a hard time with
their beliefs. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">9. Contact
local civic organizations. </h2>

<p> In most towns, there are various local civic organizations
that might want to have presentations on the drug war for any of
a variety of reasons. Some of them will do it just for the
entertainment value. Go through the phone book and locate the
Rotarians, the Elks, etc. and ask them if they would be
interested. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">10. Write
to and call your local Congressman. </h2>

<p> Most members of Congress are chowder-heads, but there are
some out there who are intelligent enough to read the facts and
stand up for the truth. We won't know who they are until people
like you can find them. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">11.
Produce Local Access Cable Shows. </h2>

<p> You can become a producer for local access cable channels
with as little as five hours of mostly free classes. Call your
local cable company for information. Once you become a producer
you can use their facilities to tape shows, or you can broadcast
tapes which were prepared by others. We have already done this a
few times and have a number of shows which can be made available
to anyone who is hooked in to their local access cable channels. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">12. Don't
get discouraged. </h2>

<p> It may take time to build your persuasive skills and even the
best of us don't persuade everybody the first time around. Keep
it up, despite the setbacks, and you will eventually prevail. <br>

Online Library <br>

<p><font size="2">Introduction and Explanation</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Where the Contributions Go</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Snail Mail Contributions</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Contributions by 900 number</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Contributions by credit card (coming soon)</font>
</p>

<p>Introduction and Explanation </p>

<p><font size="2">We are talking about money, so let's be frank.
This library is free and open to the public without any charge
whatsoever, and it will remain so as long as I am able to manage
it. But it does take more than a fair amount of time, labor, and
money to make it happen. Cash contributions are always
appreciated and are a real help in getting the resources we need
to build the library.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I have received small contributions from time
to time but they do not match my own personal out-of-pocket
expenses by any means, and probably never will. While I will
accept contributions from anyone who wishes to give, there is no
reasonable expectation that this effort will ever produce a
profit for me.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I now have more than 50,000 pages of material
to scan, type in, or otherwise add to the library, much of it
sent in by major researchers around the world. For the vast
majority of it, I will have to donate my own time to the cause,
or persuade my wife to do it, taking time away from efforts which
might have earned us a better income. Some of this information is
just as fascinating as the best of the pieces which are already
up there. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">You can make a general contribution to the
library as a whole. In this case, we will use the money toward
the projects which we currently feel are the top priority. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">You can make a specific contribution to a
particular project. You may select one of the works in progress
on the Specific Contributions page, our you may write in your own
ideas for what you would like to see done with the money. </font></p>

<h3>Where the Contributions Go</h3>

<p><font size="2">Contributions made through this screen are made
to Clifford A. and Yvonne Schaffer as individuals and are <u>not</u>
tax-deductible. There is no formal organization behind this
effort, either profit or non-profit. It is provided and
maintained by individuals only.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">How do you know that we will use the money for
the stated purpose? Well, the best answer is that we have been
doing this for several years without any contributions, and we
will continue to do it regardless of whether you or anyone else
contributes. You must have some faith that we, as individuals,
will use your contribution for the stated purpose. If you don't
have faith in that, based on past performance, don't make a
contribution. </font></p>

<h2>How to Contribute by 900 Number</h2>

<p>You can make a contribution by calling a 900 number and the
contribution will be billed to your phone bill. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Call 1-900-443-3030 to donate $10.00 </li>
    <li>Call 1-900-950-9900 to donate $15.00 </li>
    <li>Call 1-900-988-9090 to donate $25.00 </li>
    <li>Call 1-900-950-0001 to donate $30.00 </li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>When the operator answers, give them System ID 2009421 </li>
    <li>The operator will give you a numeric code in return. </li>
    <li>Enter the code and your information in the form below,
        and click on the submit button. </li>
</ol>

<h1>What's Next? </h1>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> This is my view of what is the current most important step in
promoting drug policy reform. This includes some suggestions on
how you can help. </p>

<p> <img src="../GRAPHICS/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2><a name="DDE_LINK2"><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif"
align="BOTTOM"></a>WHAT IS THE MAIN PRIORITY AT THIS POINT? </h2>

<p> A few people have asked the basic question, What's next? What
is the main priority at this point? </p>

<p> A good question. In order to answer it correctly we have to
back up and review the current state of affairs. </p>

<h2><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">WHERE ARE
WE WITH RESPECT TO THE GOALS? </h2>

<p> First, it is necessary to establish where we are with respect
to our goals. Atlanta has come and gone. I don't think the drug
warriors got as much publicity as perhaps they wanted, and it
looks like a flash in the pan. No doubt they will try to use
their resolution as proof of something </p>

<p> when they are pressed in the debate. In their rather
simplistic view of the issue they have confused the main point
and will continue to lose debates as time goes on. As Drug Czar
Lee Brown has recently stated, their strategy will be to pretend
that the issue doesn't exist. They just don't want to hear about
it. </p>

<p> The bottom line is that Atlanta won't do much to change the
long term trend in public thinking, particularly if we are
intelligent about what we do. The trend is going our way and will
continue to go our way. Little by little, we are working our way
to a majority. </p>

<h2><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">THE HOOVER
RESOLUTION? </h2>

<p> Alan asks if the main priority at this point should be to
push the Hoover Resolution. In a sense, that should be the main
priority, but we have to recognize the underlying issues
involved. </p>

<p> The Hoover Resolution was built upon the recognition of the
single biggest flaw behind the drug war -- ignorance. No one
could support these kinds of policies if they had even read the
evidence, so I knew that every drug warrior could be defeated if
you could just get to the evidence. A good knowledge of the
evidence is enough to publicly destroy any of them. </p>

<p> The Hoover Resolution has already been successful to a
certain extent. The last Crime Bill provided for a commission
which is due to start work in 1996. They are now selecting people
to sit on the commission, but I have no idea of their progress on
selecting any members. There is still some question about whether
it will come off or, if it does, who will be on it or how deeply
it will delve into the issues. </p>

<p> Regardless of the commission, we should be prepared with the
information the commission should read, or that anyone should
read on this issue. We should have such complete evidence and
research on the issue that anyone who wants information on the
issue will have to come to us. </p>

<h3>IS IT PROPER TO REFER TO IT AS THE HOOVER RESOLUTION? </h3>

<p> No, but I often do it anyway. </p>

<h3>SHOULD WE POST THE HOOVER RESOLUTION ON A FORM? </h3>

<p> Sure. As long as we follow all of the original rules of the
Hoover Resolution -- that is, it must be very clear what the
people are agreeing to -- only what the Resolution states.
Signatures must include name, title, mailing address, and the
form should ask them if they would like to join any of the
various national organizations. </p>

<h3><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">MEMBERSHIP
SUBSCRIPTION PAGES </h3>

<p> We should have an independent membership page for each of the
organizations covered under our group. People should be allowed
to subscribe on-line. We don't have to hassle the problems with
credit cards or anything yet, just let them enter their name and
address and the organization can send them an envelope. </p>

<h2><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">WHY WILL
THE DRUG WAR FALL? </h2>

<p> The drug war will eventually fall for the same reason that
communism fell. That is, they are both repressive systems which
depend upon hiding or ignoring knowledge iin pursuit of an
ideological goal. As such they are wildly impractical, and that
impracticality becomes more apparent as more knowledge becomes
available. The Soviet Union fell because, in order to enforce
their restrictions on knowledge, they had to put photocopy
machines under lock and key and require forms to be filled out
every time someone wanted to make a copy. You can imagine the
effect that would have on a modern competitive business. The
invention of the personal computer was their complete downfall.
It became apparent that they could not have a modern economy if
they did not have person computers, fax machines, and the like.
But, of course, that meant that everyone was a publisher. If
everyone is a publisher, sooner or later the truth is going to
get out. </p>

<p> Computers and the Internet will be the key elements which
bring down the drug war. Political systems based on ignorance
will come down because of the information which can be made
available to anyone through computers. That is also the
fundamental idea behind the CD ROM -- widespread public education
of the facts. We will win our struggle as soon as the public
knows the facts. We have taken the first steps with the formal
establishment of our org. </p>

<p> <img src="../GRAPHICS/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">#1
PRIORITY -- GET THE KNOWLEDGE ASSEMBLED </h2>

<p> Our Number One Priority at this point should be to locate all
of the information on drug policy that we can find, convert it to
computer format, and post it in a commonly accessed place on the
web. We should set up an interlinked network of web pages
accessible from a single web page which serves as a directory.
Behind these web pages should be all of the information we can
get. Remember all the times that people on the net have asked
questions or argued about some aspect of the drug issue? No more.
Any time anyone has a question, we should be able to point
directly to documents on-line which provide an immediate answer. </p>

<h3>WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION? </h3>

<p> Anything relevant to the subject. We have nothing at all to
fear from the truth and you will notice that, on my web pages, I
will include materials which are propaganda of the opposition.
Ultimately, we gain the most from the broadest range of
information. We should scan, retrieve, enter by hand, or do
whatever we can to build the best library anyone has ever seen on
the subject. We have to make our web sites an absolute must-see
for any member of the media who wants to do anything on the
subject. (Please note that, even while the public as a whole may
not be on the net yet, the media is far more likely to be
connected to the net. This is an issue on which we can, in
effect, force their behavior. If our web pages have enough
information, they will be forced to come to us.) </p>

<p> Think of it this way. In the course of these conversations we
have passed back and forth a lot of good solid information to
each other, such as the information put forth on hemp, or the
backgrounds of Voth and Nahas. That kind of information should be
posted so it is available to anyone who wants it, any time they
need it. The only real difference is that we should use a less
conversational style. That is, when we post the information to
the library, it should be in &quot;encyclopedia style&quot; </p>

<h3>A CENTRAL ENTRY POINT - The World's Best Library on Drug
Policy. </h3>

<p> Right now, if we want to tell the media about our growing
library of on-line information, we would have to give them the
names of a multitude of web sites and tell them to go poke around
on their own. We need one main menu page to give them for the
library. </p>

<p> We should establish a central entry point to all the web
sites of interest. This one home page would list all of the other
web pages which have factual information of interest on the
subject. This will make it easy for us to give the media a single
access point where they can find all of the information. That is
important in uniformly advertising it to the media around the
world. </p>

<p> That central point should have an index (updated once a month
perhaps) which will point to each of the web sites and provide
some sort of explanation as to what kind of materials are behind
it. </p>

<h3>MAKE SURE THE MEDIA KNOWS WHERE TO GO FOR INFO </h3>

<p> Then we will have to make sure that ALL the media knows that
they have to go to our page if they are going to discuss the drug
issue. That will require a dedicated campaign to publish the
location of our unified home page to all media sources. Our next
priority will be to make sure that everyone in the media knows
where to look. We will each have to contact our local news
sources and make sure they know. It should be mentioned as a
standard reference in every letter to the editor, for example. We
should mention our unified home page everywhere we go. Print it
on your letterhead and business cards. </p>

<p> <img src="../GRAPHICS/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h3>TASKS TO BE DONE </h3>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">Top Items
to be Put on the Web </h4>

<p> This is a list, somewhat incomplete as yet, of the top items
we intend to put on the web pages as soon as we can. We ask
everyone to help us by contributing this information in
electronic form. If you have it, you can e-mail it to
schaffer@smartlink.net. And thanks! </p>

<p> If all you have is a paper copy, we would appreciate that
too. You can send stuff to Dave Borden at Drug Policy Foundation,
4455 Connecticut Ave., N.W., Suite B-500, Washington, DC
20008-2302. </p>

<p> You can snail-mail stuff to me at: <b>Cliff Schaffer, P.O.
Box 1430, Canyon Country, CA 91386-1430</b> </p>

<p> 1. Information for Dave Bordens &quot;Tour of the War on
Drugs&quot;. Use your imagination here, but if you were going to
give someone a tour of the War on Drugs, what would you include?
It should have lots of interesting facts, graphics, documents,
etc. </p>

<p> 2. A video file which contains a good quality copy of
&quot;Hemp for Victory&quot;. We would like to put in online
where it can be distributed to the world. If you already have a
computer and a VCR, the cost of the video capture board is
currently running around $500 to $700. Or maybe you know someone
who has one . . . </p>

<p> 3. The full text of any of the reference sources listed in
the <a href="../LIBRARY/studlist.html">Biggest Studies of Drug
Policy</a>. We much prefer the electronic format but if all you
have is a good paper copy, we will try to work with it. </p>

<p> 4. The full text of the Congressional Record for the portions
relevant to both the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914 and the
Marijuana Tax Act of 1937. </p>

<p> 5. Charts, pictures, etc., which show the current statistics
for all of the issues related to drug policy. </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">SCANNING </h4>

<p> We have a huge task ahead of us. We must convert tens of
thousands of pages of information to computer format. Most of the
information, such as the major studies of drug policy, never was
in computer format and some of the documents are quite large. The
task will probably take man years of scanning effort to be
properly accomplished. The only way we will get it done (with our
limited financial resources) is if everyone does a little bit. I
strongly recommend that you get a scanner as soon as possible.
You don't need much, a simple gray scale scanner with OCR will do
the trick. Shop around and you can install a minimum page-feed
scanner in an existing computer system, with OCR for about $250.
A good quality flat-bed color scanner with a page feed option
currently runs about $1,000. I have found from my own experience
that the handheld scanners are not adequate to the task. </p>

<p> Does anyone know where we can get scanners cheaply (free) to
distribute to volunteers who will commit to using them? </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">GETTING
THE WORD OUT TO THE MEDIA </h4>

<p> We will need volunteers who will help us get the word out to
the lawmakers and the media when we are ready to launch. Anyone
can help here, if they have a telephone, a stamp, or an e-mail
address. </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">FORMATTING
AND ORGANIZING </h4>

<p> We will also need people to specialize in the librarian
function. That is, we must have people who are willing to spend
the time to: </p>

<p> Organize the data so it has a logical structure and is easy
to find. </p>

<p> Establish links from references in one document to the actual
text of the cited documents. </p>

<p> Format good looking web pages according to a standard format </p>

<p> We will need standards for how the web pages will be
constructed and their overall look. (Please understand, it is not
that I want to limit your creativity with web pages, it is just
that we want to present to the public the look of a uniform,
organized library.) I recommend that anyone who is interested in
working on this end of the task should buy a copy of Teach
Yourself Web Publishing With HTML In A Week, by Laura Lemay from
Sams Publishing. I just got a copy and found it quite helpful. </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">READING
AND SUMMARIZING </h4>

<p> There will be a lot of information on line. We will need
people to read through volumes of information and prepare
accurate summaries on a chapter by chapter basis. </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">PROGRAMMING
</h4>

<p> Someone will have to program the membership forms and other
stuff required by this little venture. </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">WHERE TO
GO TO GET THE DATA </h4>

<p> 1. Information from other on-line services. We must
accumulate all of the information in a place we control and
organize. </p>

<p> 2. Government sources. A lot of the government agencies are
now publishing information in computer format, including CD-ROM.
We should make it a point to get all of this information we can
and bring it together in a logical organization which makes it
easy for people to find. </p>

<p> 3. Historical records. A good project for anyone would be to
go to the library and browse through the newspapers of anywhere
from 1860 to the present and get copies of all the articles they
can find relating to drugs. </p>

<p> 4. Private collections of documents. I have already contacted
a number of prominent people to ask them if we can get their
personal records which relate to drug policy. We want to develop
a depth of information which cannot be challenged and the private
records of individuals involved in the drug war is a good way to
do it. </p>

<p> 5. NIDA research. The National Instiute on Drug Abuse has
published volumes of data on all sorts of issues. We should start
with the most interesting stuff. </p>

<p> 6. The Congressional Record. We need to get on-line the
entire text of the Congressional Record relating to all of our
current drug laws. Most important-- we must get the text of the
original proceedings behind these laws. Harry Anslinger's words
should be posted in a place where all the world can read them. </p>

<p> 7. Current Media. Scan and/or summarize articles from your
local newspaper. Include the full citations of the name of the
newspaper, the headline of the article and the date it was
published. Also include a summary, length as appropriate, of the
major points made in the article. If we can get permission to
reprint, we should do so. If not, we will publish a summary of
the points made in the article, but retain the scanned text in a
private library for backup. </p>

<p> 8. Videos and movies. We should convert things such as Hemp
for Victory to computer format. This can be done with a computer,
a VCR, and a video capture board (now down to as low as $179.00) </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">WEB PAGE
STANDARDS </h4>

<p> I suggest the following as a preliminary suggestion for web
page standards. More complete standards, including a template,
should be developed by a committee working on the formatting and
organizing team. </p>

<p> 1. All web pages should include both the name of the current
page plus the name of the central home page. This will make sure
that anyone who prints out the information will know where it
came from. The name of the central home page should also be
included as a header in all text files on the net. </p>

<p> 2. All menus should contain links back to your own home page
as well as the central home page. </p>

<p> 3. All menu pages should include the title of the document,
and a description of the author and the contents of the work. </p>

<p> 4. All web pages under your own home page should have a
consistent layout. The layout should be simple and without
excessive graphics, so it doesn't take a month to download them. </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">COPYRIGHTS
</h4>

<p> Under current copyright law we cannot post anything which is
copyrighted without the permission of the copyright owner. Here
is how to get around this restriction and still have a complete
on-line library. </p>

<p> 1) Any material produced by any government agency, or the
texts of official statements by public officials is in the public
domain and may be posted without any problems. </p>

<p> 2) The current copyright law is that copyrights are effective
for the life of the creator plus fifty years. The old law was
that copyrights were valid for 28 years with a renewal of 28
years. What this means is (with some exceptions) materials
published before about 1940 have probably fallen into the public
domain. </p>

<ol>
    <li>I have a feeling that, if some people or organizations
        were asked, they would grant us permission to post their
        materials, or at least excerpts from the materials. If we
        cannot get permission, we will post our own written
        summaries of the materials -- reviews of the essential
        points made by the document. </li>
</ol>

<p>The attached graph presents use and abuse (including
dependence) rates for American adults in 1985. Use rates were
taken from National (USA) Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) 1985
national household survey, and abuse/dependence rates were taken
from the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (1994), which
cited community studies in the USA conducted between 1981 and
1985. &quot;Abuse&quot; involves problematic use of a given
substance, whereas &quot;dependence&quot; involves more
pathological use which substantially affects social,
occupational, and/or educational functioning. The graph lumps
abuse and dependence together meaning general problematic use,
which is labelled simply &quot;abuse.&quot; </p>

<p>By</p>

<p>Gordon E. Kenney, Ph.D. Licensed Psychologist The University
of Memphis Memphis, Tennessee, USA </p>

<p>The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), home of
the &quot;Drug Czar&quot; (or is it Tsar?), has been charged with
eradicating illicit drug use since 1982. The ONDCP's budget
increased over 600% between 1982 and 1992, and now well exceeds
$13 billion. </p>

<p>The attached graph compares arrests and lifetime substance use
and abuse (including dependence) rates pertaining to alcohol and
illict drugs in the United States in an effort to evaluate the
&quot;impact&quot; the ONDCP has had on illicit drug use and
abuse. The following information concerns 1985 data from the
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the American Psychiatric
Association, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The
year 1985 was chosen because it is the latest year for which
there are solid national estimates of drug and alcohol abuse. </p>

<p>The data indicate that many more Americans used alcohol than
illicit drugs in 1985. Among alcohol users, about 14% were
abusers (or were otherwise dependent on it), whereas illicit drug
abusers (or dependents) comprised about 17% of illicit drug
users. This illicit drug abuse rate may even be inflated, because
rates cited by the American Psychiatric Association were
aggregated for use in the graph below which did not account for
concurrent abuse of multiple drugs. About 1% of alcohol
users/abusers were arrested for drunkenness or DUI/DWI offenses,
whereas about 0.5% (i.e., one-half of 1%) of illicit drug
users/abusers were arrested for possession of illicit drugs. </p>

<p>By</p>

<p>Gordon E. Kenney, Ph.D. Licensed Psychologist The University
of Memphis Memphis, Tennessee, USA </p>

<p>The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), home of
the &quot;Drug Czar&quot; (or is it Tsar?), has been charged with
eradicating illicit drug use since 1982. The ONDCP's budget
increased over 600% between 1982 and 1992, and now well exceeds
$13 billion. </p>

<p>The attached graph compares arrests and lifetime substance use
and abuse (including dependence) rates pertaining to alcohol and
illict drugs in the United States in an effort to evaluate the
&quot;impact&quot; the ONDCP has had on illicit drug use and
abuse. The following information concerns 1985 data from the
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the American Psychiatric
Association, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The
year 1985 was chosen because it is the latest year for which
there are solid national estimates of drug and alcohol abuse. </p>

<p>The data indicate that many more Americans used alcohol than
illicit drugs in 1985. Among alcohol users, about 14% were
abusers (or were otherwise dependent on it), whereas illicit drug
abusers (or dependents) comprised about 17% of illicit drug
users. This illicit drug abuse rate may even be inflated, because
rates cited by the American Psychiatric Association were
aggregated for use in the graph below which did not account for
concurrent abuse of multiple drugs. About 1% of alcohol
users/abusers were arrested for drunkenness or DUI/DWI offenses,
whereas about 0.5% (i.e., one-half of 1%) of illicit drug
users/abusers were arrested for possession of illicit drugs. </p>

<h1>How To Reduce Junk E-Mail </h1>

<p> From: Ryan Rossman &lt;rossm_ry@catseq.catlin.edu&gt; </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2>The 3 keys to reducing &quot;junk&quot; email. </h2>

<ol>
    <li><b>Accurate Subject headings.</b> </li>
    <li><b>If you send it to the whole list, make sure it applies
        to the whole list.</b> </li>
    <li><b>Be substantial, ask yourself am I contributing to the
        list or detracting?</b> </li>
</ol>

<h3>Subject Lines: </h3>

<p> One way to make it easier to get to the meaty information you
want is to have *accurate* subject lines. If the subject line of
your post says Re: Proposed Strategies and you are talking about
something completely different, or are branching off from this
discussion create a new subject heading. Example: </p>

<p> Instead of just Re: Proposed Strategies which doesn't really
tell anyone what the content of the message is about. Try... </p>

<p> Discussion of CD Tactics (was Re: Proposed Strategies) </p>

<p> This is very helpful, in discovering and only reading the
posts you want to read. </p>

<h3>Personal Posts: </h3>

<p> Short, one or two line posts that only make a personal
statement torwards one or two people should be done in private.
The main goal is to respect other members of the group enough so
as to not post something that they are just going to have delete.
</p>

<p> There are two ways to avoid problems with being personal. </p>

<ol>
    <li>If all you really want to do is make a short 1 or 2 line
        personal rseponse to someone don't send it to the entire
        list just send it to that person. </li>
    <li>If you are making personal comments make sure that there
        is also something substantial that is pertinent to
        everyone included in the post. </li>
</ol>

<p> Basically if it doesn't have something that applies to the
whole list, don't post it to the whole list. </p>

<p> Please don't hestiate to be controversial or disagree with
others, this is called freedom of speech and its why a revolution
was waged, but do NOT use drctalk-l for excessive personal
banter. If it has substance </p>

<p> with a little banter, I don't think we have a problem.
Meaning that you can say nice &quot;Amens!&quot; and &quot;Way to
go!&quot; **IF** you also include something a little bit more
meaningful. If there is no substance and a lot of banter you
probably shouldn't have sent it to the whole list. This includes
the 1 or 2 line personal notes. </p>

<p> If we still have a problem with &quot;junk&quot; posts and
the traffic volume is still too high there are more stringent
measures that can be imposed. <br>

<h2>Chapter Three: The Experience of Foreign Countries and Drug
Legalization </h2>

<hr>

<p><b>Discussion</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization suggest that the experiences of
countries such as Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Switzerland
prove the efficacy of legalizing or decriminalizing various types
of illegal drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and marijuana. They
maintain that because such drugs are legal, these countries have
fewer addicts and less drug-related crime. </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>The statements of the legalizers here are empirically untrue.
As we discuss each country in turn, it will be shown that
legalization did not work in any of them. </p>

<p><b>A. Great Britain</b> </p>

<p>With the report of a government commission known as the Brain
Committee of 1964, England instituted a policy whereby doctors
could prescribe heroin so long as they followed certain treatment
criteria.47 Previously in England, doctors could prescribe heroin
much like any other opiate (such as morphine). This allowed a few
unscrupulous doctors to sell ungodly amounts of heroin to members
of the black market.48 Consequently, it was believed that if
heroin were offered at medical clinics according to stringent
rules and regulations, addicts would come to these clinics to
seek treatment and eventually would overcome their habit. </p>

<p>As of 1983, however, England began to phase out these programs
of clinically supplied heroin in favor of methadone treatment.49
Why? First, according to the reputable British physician journal <u>Lancet</u>,
the number of addicts increased 100% between 1970 and 1980.50 A
disproportionate number of these new addicts were between the
ages of sixteen and seventeen.51 Second, only twenty percent of
all of the addicts in England belonged to the clinical
programs.52 At first blush, this fact seems strange - why would
addicts choose not to participate in a program wherein they get
free methadone? The answer probably lies in the fact that
methadone does not produce the high that heroin does. Also,
addicts probably did not care for the mandatory treatment and
rehabilitation facets of the clinical programs. Whatever the
reason, by 1985 England had 80,000 heroin addicts, the vast
majority of whom wen not in treatment.53 </p>

<p>A third reason why England began to abolish its clinical
heroin program was the fact that not only were there few people,
in them, but the programs themselves did not work. According to
the <u>British Medical Journal</u>, more addicts left the program
because of criminal convictions than because of treatment.54
Fourth, even with the clinical programs, heroin addicts had a
death rate twenty-six times the average population. Finally, even
when the programs were in operation, Scotland Yard had to
increase its narcotics division 100% in order to cope with the
increased crime rate.56 </p>

<p>To summarize, the British experience with decriminalized
heroin in the clinical context was a dismal failure. When experts
from British Columbia were debating whether to create a similar
program, they made the following conclusions that are so
important as to deserve to be quoted at length: </p>

<p>While some success is claimed in terms of reducing the
incidence of young users, the following findings have also been
noted: </p>

<p>1) The British approach has failed to attract a majority of
addicts; </p>

<p>2) Many registered addicts continue to turn to illicit sources
of </p>

<p>drugs; </p>

<p>3) Many registered addicts do not decrease their dosage over
time; </p>

<p>4) Many registered addicts continue to be involved in criminal
activity; </p>

<p>5) Many registered addicts are chronically unemployed or do
not earn enough to look after themselves; </p>

<p>6) The death rate of registered addicts is much higher than
that of the general population and may be higher than that of
North American addicts; </p>

<p>7) Since 1960, there has been a dramatic increase in the
English addict population; </p>

<p>8) The black market for heroin continues to thrive; </p>

<p>9) Law enforcement appears to remain a necessary, costly and
complex control measure. </p>

<p>In view of the above, it is felt that the application of the
British approach to British Columbia would present serious
dangers.57 </p>

<p><b>B. The Netherlands</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization almost certainly would cite
Amsterdam as the drug Mecca of the Western world. Anyone may go
into the restaurants in this city and order marijuana and hashish
from a menu; further, heroin and cocaine have been decriminalized
for all practical purposes. The police simply leave the users
alone. Consequently, health officials estimate that Amsterdam has
7,000 addicts, 20% of whom are foreigners.58 These addicts are
responsible for 80% of all property crime in the city, thus
necessitating that Amsterdam maintain a police presence far
greater than those of cities of comparable size in the United
States.59 </p>

<p>The Dutch have not raised one dollar in tax revenue from drug
sales, and drug violators account for 50 percent of the Dutch
prison population, a higher proportion than in the United
States.60 The Netherlands is the most crime-prone nation in
Europe and most drug addicts live on state welfare payments and
by committing crimes.61 Nationwide, the number of reported crimes
increased to 1.3 million in 1992 from. 812,000 in 1981.62 Faced
with public disgust at home over soaring drug related crime and
pressure from other European Community countries to strengthen
drug laws, Dutch authorities are implementing an aggressive
program to reduce drug-linked crimes and disturbances and show
new teeth in combatting illegal drug sales.63 Eberhard van der
Laan, leader Of the Social Democrats in the Amsterdam City
Council says, &quot;People are absolutely fed up with all the
troubles caused by drug addicts - car windows broken, noise,
whole streets almost given up to the drug problem.&quot;64
Legalization advocates claim that marijuana use in Netherlands
has not increased since the laws were liberalized, but the number
of Amsterdam drug cafes rose from 30 to over 300 in one decade.
They also fail to note that daily marijuana use by U.S. youth has
declined by 75 percent.65 </p>

<p><b>C. Switzerland</b> </p>

<p>Much like Amsterdam, Switzerland until recently followed a
policy of decriminalization. Indeed, a city park in the town of
Zurich for many years was allowed to be a haven for drug users -
police simply would ignore the problem by claiming that it was
better to have all the addicts in one place rather than having
them roam throughout the entire city.66 Unsurprisingly, in
February of 1992 Switzerland ended this experiment with
decriminalization after experiencing an unacceptable increase in
use, violence, crime and health costs and consequences.67
Specifically, the number of addicts residing at the park (called
Platzspitz) jumped from a few hundred in 1987 to over 20,000, by
early 1992.68 Approximately 20% of these addicts were foreigners
who came to Zurich to take advantage of the city's lax drug
laws.69 In deciding to close the park, city officials cited the
increased incidence of crime and prostitution--as Andres Oehler,
a municipal spokesperson stated, &quot;it was felt that the
situation had got out of control in every sense.&quot;70 </p>

<p><b>D. Spain</b> </p>

<p>Since 1983 in Spain, it has been legal to use, but not sell,
cocaine and heroin. Recently, however, </p>

<p>Spanish officials have begun a crack-down on drug pushers due
to a dramatic increase in the addiction rate.71 Unsurprisingly,
Spain and Italy, which also legalized use of cocaine and heroin,
have the highest rates of both drug use and overdose of all
European countries.72 </p>

<p><b>E. China</b> </p>

<p>Lest we forget the lessons of history, consider that in the
late 1800's, opium was legal in China. By 1900, ninety million
Chinese were addicted to the drug, and it took fifty years of
repressive police measures and rehabilitation to correct the
problem.73 Today, opium and other addictive drugs are illegal.74 </p>

<p><b>F. Japan</b> </p>

<p>In the 1950's, Japan was faced with an epidemic of amphetamine
use that created half a million addicts. Through socialization
and policies aimed at both reducing supply and <u>demand</u>, the
number of addicts was decreased to a few thousand within four
years.75 A heroin epidemic involving thousands of addicts was
dealt with successfully in the 1960's using the same measures. 76
</p>

<p><b>G. Other countries</b> </p>

<p>Throughout recent history, numerous other countries have
attempted legalizing or decriminalizing drugs, all meeting with
the same harmful results. In Egypt in the 1920's, an unrestricted
supply of cocaine and heroin created an epidemic that eventually
resulted in the strict prosecution of all addicts.77 In Thailand
and Iran, countries that traditionally have had cheap and
unrestricted sources of narcotics, the addiction rates have been
and continue to be high.78 Finally, the Republic of Singapore had
to resort to strict law enforcement and mandatory rehabilitation
in order to overcome a heroin epidemic.79 </p>

<p>Given the experiences of countries such as Great Britain,
Switzerland, The Netherlands, China, Japan, Spain, Egypt, Iran,
and Thailand, it is little wonder why countries that
traditionally have had lenient drug laws are all moving in the
direction of illegalization. Undoubtedly, the danger that drug
legalization presents was foremost on the minds of the numerous
countries - the United States included - that signed the Single
Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and the Convention on
Psychotropic Substances of 1971. And such danger also is why the
International Narcotics Control Board for the United Nations
concluded in 1992 that &quot;legalization advocates have not yet
presented a sufficiently comprehensive, coherent or viable
alternative to the present system of international drug abuse
control.&quot;80 </p>

<h2>Chapter Seven: Medical Uses of Presently Illegal Drugs </h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization suggest that even if drugs such as
cocaine, marijuana, and heroin are not fully legalized, they
should be made more available as forms of medical treatment. For
example, legalizers suggest that heroin should be used much in
the same way as is morphine presently and that marijuana should
be used in treating glaucoma and the side-effects of
chemotherapy. </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>In order to fully analyze the debate surrounding the medical
uses of heroin and marijuana, each drug should be discussed in
turn. </p>

<p><b>1. Heroin</b> </p>

<p>Heroin is an opiate, as are drugs such as morphine. Legalizers
suggest that because morphine does not always succeed in
relieving the pain of, for example, cancer patients, the only
logical step is to try heroin. This is factually incorrect. </p>

<p>In order to understand why this argument is flawed, one must
know how heroin and morphine differ from one another. As Drs.
Robert McCarthy and Michael Montagne explain, &quot;Kaiko, et al.
found that although heroin is more potent - and achieves peak
pain control and mood elevation effects faster, both pain control
and mood elevation are more prolonged with morphine. &quot;116
That is, heroin gives you a quicker &quot;high,&quot; but
morphine provides longer-lasting effects. Furthermore, we have
many other opioids available under present pharmaceutical laws.
As Professor Arthur G. Lipman explains, </p>

<p>[s]ome advocates of heroin legalization argue that it should
be available as an alternative opioid because some patients
respond better to one opioid than another. That is true. However,
we already have a variety of opioids commercially available in
this country. If a patient does not respond to morphine as
expected, it would be more logical to use a chemically different
opioid (e.g., hydromorphone, methadone) than a morphine product
[such as heroin]. Therefore, the argument for heroin is not
logical. 117 </p>

<p>Not only is Professor Lipman's argument medically sound, but
it makes common sense. Heroin and morphine have similar chemical
structures. If morphine does not work for a given patient, it
makes more sense to try an opioid with a different chemical
construct than to give them a drug very similar to the one that
is not working. </p>

<p>These two facts----that heroin does not produce as constant
and prolonged a treatment as does morphine, and that many other
opioids presently exist that can do the job better than heroin in
the event that morphine does not work - help to explain why the
vast majority of medical society members do not favor the use of
heroin as a form of therapeutic treatment. The British doctors
who initially suggested the viability of therapeutic heroin
treatment long ago reversed their position.118 And although
Maurice Bectel, President of the American Pharmaceutical
Association, admits that problems do exist in the treatment of
cancer pain, these problems stem largely from the fact that
&quot;physicians fail to prescribe proper dosages of existing
medications, not because of the lack of availability of
heroin.&quot;119 Indeed, as Professor Lipman correctly notes,
&quot;[i]f the energy devoted to legalizing heroin were
redirected toward better use of available opioids, patients <u>would</u>
benefit.120 </p>

<p>But not only is allowing the therapeutic use of heroin
unnecessary, it also could create other problems. For example,
increased medical use of heroin increases the risk of
&quot;diversion&quot;-- that the patients would sell their heroin
on the black market.121 Also, if pharmacies routinely stocked a
supply of heroin, it would increase the risk of burglaries. This
fact gives one special concern when one notes that fully 50% of
burglaries against pharmacies are committed with the intention of
stealing controlled substances.122 </p>

<p>In short, Lipman concludes that &quot;[m]isinformation about
heroin has clouded the issue, but there is </p>

<p>valid, published scientific evidence that unequivocally
refutes the argument that heroin should be legalized.&quot;123 </p>

<p><b>2. Marijuana</b> </p>

<p><b>a. Treatment for glaucoma</b> </p>

<p>Glaucoma is a disease in which the fluid pressure within the
eyeball (known as the intraocular pressure) increases and thereby
damages the optic nerve, potentially causing blindness.
Legalizers advance the claim that marijuana can decrease the
intraocular pressure and thereby prevent blindness. Let's look at
this claim. </p>

<p>First, the studies that the legalizers cite for support of
their propositions assume the use of THC itself rather than
marijuana.125 Thus while one may claim that THC decreases
intraocular pressure, it is not technically correct to claim that
marijuana does as well. </p>

<p>Second, even if marijuana does decrease intraocular pressure,
it does so only at high dosages - in order to get the benefits,
you have to stay stoned all day. Doctor Keith Green suggests that
in order to decrease intraocular pressure, one would have to
smoke the equivalent of six joints a day.126 Michael Van Buskirk,
Director of Glaucoma Services and Chairman of the Department of
Ophthalmology at Devers Eye Institute agrees, stating that
&quot;[a]lcohol also produces a profound reduction in . . .
intraocular pressure. 'Me recommendation to use marijuana is
exactly analogous to the recommendation to ingest alcohol and
maintain a state of drunkenness to treat glaucoma.&quot;127 </p>

<p>Third, even if marijuana successfully combats one symptom of
glaucoma - intraocular pressure - it does so at the expense of
exacerbating another symptom. For while marijuana may decrease
intraocular pressure, it also decreases blood pressure (and thus
blood flow) to the eye. Carl Kupfer, director of the National Eye
Institute, explains: </p>

<p>For the optic nerve to be properly nourished, there, must be
an adequate amount of blood flowing to that nerve at all times,
so that if we have a drug that both lowers intraocular pressure
as well as blood pressure, we may be interfering with the supply
of blood to the optic nerve, and therefore even though the
pressure in the eye may decrease, such a patient will not be
protected against losing visual function from the glaucoma
process.128 </p>

<p>Thus, marijuana at best alleviates one problem of glaucoma
while increasing the risk of another. And in order to even
accomplish this ambivalent goal, one must stay stoned the entire
day. It is no surprise, then, that experts such as Doctor Green
conclude that &quot;marijuana. . . has little potential future as
a glaucoma medication.&quot;129 </p>

<p><b>b. Treatment for chemotherapy</b> </p>

<p>Proponents also suggest that marijuana is useful to combat the
side-effects of chemotherapy such as nausea and vomiting. To
support their position, they cite a study conducted by Mark
Kleiman which found that 40% of cancer specialists had
recommended marijuana to relieve chemotherapy nausea. 130 </p>

<p>First, the Kleiman study is flawed statistically and
methodologically. 57% of the doctors that Kleiman sent
questionnaires to did not even bother to return them. Also,
Kleiman does not document the number of questionnaires that were
returned unanswered. Further, Kleiman does not document the
number of questionnaires that expressed no opinion as to the
therapeutic use of marijuana. Once all of these factors are
considered, Kleiman's &quot;40%&quot; acceptance rate would be no
more than 15%, and, according to Dr. Richard Schwartz, Clinical
Professor of Pediatrics at Georgetown University School of
Medicine, is &quot;probably much less.&quot;131 </p>

<p>Second, the nation's top cancer experts reject marijuana for
chemotherapy treatment. As David Ettinger, professor of oncology
at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine notes,
&quot;There is no indication that marijuana is effective in
treating nausea and vomiting resulting from radiation treatment
or other causes. No legitimate studies have been conducted which
make such conclusions.&quot;132 Doctor John Laszlo, Vice
President of Research for the American Cancer Society agrees that
there is insufficient evidence to suggest that marijuana is a
useful chemotherapy treatment.133 </p>

<p>Third, the National Cancer Institute itself notes that
&quot;other antiemetic agents such as ondansetron,
metoclopramine, droperidol, etc. have been shown to be more
useful than marijuana-related compounds as first line
therapy.&quot;134 </p>

<p>Thus, while there is no evidence to prove marijuana's use in
chemotherapy, there are numerous alternative drugs that obviate
the need to even pursue research on the subject. </p>

<p><b>c. Treatment for AIDS</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalized drugs next suggest that marijuana is
useful in treating AIDS both because it relieves pain and because
it stimulates appetite. Unfortunately, marijuana would actually
exacerbate the health risks associated with AIDS. First, studies
conducted at the Virginia Medical College suggest that the THC in
marijuana damages the immune system, making the patient more
susceptible to colds, viruses, and influenza while at the same
time increasing the severity of any illnesses that the patient
has.135 Clearly, the last thing that a patient with AIDS needs is
to have his or her immune system weakened. Second, the marijuana
smoke itself is damaging to the AIDS patients. As Dr. Sonia
Buist, Professor of Medicine at Oregon Health Sciences University
explains, &quot;I cannot support the use of marijuana to treat
patients with this condition [AIDS]. Furthermore, I would
maintain that its use is contraindicated because marijuana smoke
is extremely irritating to the airways and may add additional
pulmonary problems in these very susceptible
individuals.&quot;136 </p>

<p><b>d. Treatment for multiple sclerosis</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization finally argue that marijuana is
useful to stop the spasms caused by multiple sclerosis. Experts
on MS absolutely reject this proposition. In fact, the scientific
opinion may be summed up by Dr. Donald Silberberg, Chair of the
Department of Neurology at the University of Pennsylvania School
of Medicine and Chief of the Neurology Service at the Hospital of
Pennsylvania, when he states that </p>

<p>I have not found any legitimate medical or scientific works
which show that marijuana... is medically effective in treating
multiple sclerosis or spasticity.... The long-term treatment of
the symptoms of multiple sclerosis through the use of marijuana
could be devastating. . . . The use of (marijuana), especially
for long-term treatment ... would be worse than the original
disease itself.&quot; </p>

<p>Having proved that marijuana is not effective in the treatment
of glaucoma, the treatment of chemotherapy side-effects, the
treatment of AIDS, or the treatment of MS, we should discuss the
evidence that suggests that marijuana is harmful to one's health.
Recall the material presented in Chapter One [Addiction Rates]
that suggested that marijuana caused numerous health problems.
Let us expand upon the inquiry. First, Swedish researchers found
that people who smoked pot fifty or more times were six times as
likely to develop schizophrenia. The study specifically found
that marijuana increased the incidence of schizophrenia not only
in those patients who were predisposed to the illness, but also
in those who were not.138 Second, physicians in 1986 began
reporting cases of lung, head, neck, tongue, and respiratory
tract cancer in patients aged 17 to 39.139 Third, maternal use of
marijuana increases the risk of childhood leukemia by 1,000%.140<b>
</b>Fourth, marijuana exposure produces abnormalities similar to
the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome but at five times the rate of alcohol.
141 </p>

<p>Thus, not only is marijuana not a good medical treatment, but
it also causes schizophrenia, cancer, leukemia, and childhood
abnormalities. Consequently, it is unsurprising to learn that
&quot;marijuana has been rejected as medicine by the American
Medical Association, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the
American Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology
and the American Cancer Society. Not one American health
association accepts marijuana as medicine.&quot;142 </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then

<p>Morphine provides longer-lasting, more consistent pain relief
than does heroin. [Robert L. McCarthy and Michael Montagne,
&quot;The argument for therapeutic use of heroin in pain
management,&quot; American Journal of Hospital Pharmacists, May
1993]. </p>

<p>If morphine does not work for a given patient, you should not
use- heroin, which is chemically very similar to morphine, but
instead should use a different opioid such as methadone. [Arthur
G. Lipman, &quot;The argument against therapeutic use of heroin
in pain management,&quot; American Journal of Hospital
Pharmacists, May 1993]. </p>

<p>The British doctors who initially advocated the therapeutic
use of heroin long ago reversed their position. [Lipman, citation
above]. </p>

<p>The American Pharmaceutical Association admits that there are
problems in pain management, but that they are due to the
tendency of doctors to fail to prescribe sufficient dosages of
presently available opioids, not because of the unavailability of
heroin. [Lipman, citation above]. </p>

<p>Allowing the therapeutic use of heroin increases the risk of
diversion-i.e. that patients will sell their drugs on the black
market rather than using it themselves. (Lipman, citation above],
</p>

<p>Allowing pharmacies to stock heroin likely would 'increase the
risk of robbery, especially when one considers that 50% of all
pharmacy burglaries are committed to steal controlled substances.
[Lipman, citation above]. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>If

<p>Marijuana should be used to treat glaucoma. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then

<p>The studies which assert that marijuana helps to decrease
intraocular pressure were conducted with THC, not with marijuana
per se. [Marijuana Scheduling Petition; Denial of Petition;
Remand; 21 CFR Part 1308 (Docket No. 86-22), 1986].<b> </b></p>

<p>In order to see a significant decrease in intraocular
pressure, you would have to smoke so much marijuana that you
would be stoned all day. [Scheduling Petition, citation above]. </p>

<p>In fact, alcohol also decreases intraocular pressure. But as
with marijuana, you would have to consume so much that you would
be drunk all day. [Sandra S. Bennett, &quot;Therapeutic
Marijuana: Fact or Fiction,&quot; Drug Watch, July 1992]. </p>

<p>Although marijuana may reduce one symptom of glaucoma
(intraocular pressure), it also exacerbates another problem.
Specifically, marijuana decreases blood pressure and hence. blood
supply to the optic nerve- Because the optic nerve no longer
receives an adequate blood supply, it can be just as damaging to
eyesight as the high intraocular pressure itself. [Bennett,
citation above (citing Michael Van Buskirk, Director of Glaucoma
Services and Chair of the Department of Ophthalmology at </p>

<p>Devers Eye Institute)]. </p>

<p>According to Doctor Keith Green, who serves or has served on
the boards of eight prestigious eye journals, &quot;Marijuana ...
has little potential future as a glaucoma medication.&quot;
[Marijuana Scheduling Petition; Denial of Petition; Remand; 21
CFR Part 1308 (Docket No. 86-22), 1986]. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>If

side- effects of chemotherapy such as nausea and vomiting. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then

<p>The study that the legalizers will probably cite-the one
conducted by Mark Kleiman, which says that 40% of doctors
questioned supported the therapeutic use of marijuana for cancer
patients--is methodologically flawed. Specifically, its return
rate (number of questionnaires returned), was only 42%, which
raises </p>

<p>the strong potential of response bias. Also, Kleiman did not
inform the reader how many of the people who did return the
questionnaire did in fact answer the questions. As one expert in
bio-statistics concluded, &quot;The report seems simple and
careless. - This is mere propaganda, and will be seen as such by
the informed reader.&quot; [Robert E. Peterson, &quot;Student
Exercise for Marijuana Activist Group Given National Media
Attention to Influence Court Case,&quot; Drug Prevention
Newsletter, June 1991). </p>

<p>As David Ettinger, professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine notes, &quot;There is no indication
that Marijuana is effective in treating nausea and vomiting
resulting from radiation treatment or other causes.&quot;
[Marijuana Scheduling Petition; Denial, of Petition; Remand; 21
CFR Part 1308 (Docket No. 86-22), 1986]. </p>

<p>The National Cancer Institute concluded that other drugs such
as ondansetron, metoclopramine, droperidol, etc. are more useful
for treating chemotherapy than is marijuana. [Janet Lapey,
&quot;Marijuana As Medicine Refuted by NIH Scientists,&quot; Drug

Justice</p>

<h2>Chapter One: Addiction Rates And Drug Legalization </h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of drug legalization argue that legalizing drugs
would decrease addiction rates for two reasons. First, they
maintain, people use drugs <i>because </i>they are illegal - that
is, people get a thrill breaking a social taboo. Legalize drugs
and the incentive to take them will go away. Second, proponents
of legalization argue that if drugs were legalized, we could
spend the money that we presently spend on the criminal justice
system on treatment of addicts.2 </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>Before addressing the particular merits of the legalization
debate, it is useful to describe just what is an addiction.
Addictions are either physical or psychological. Physical
addiction occurs when the body becomes dependent upon chemicals
or drugs not normally found in the human body and requires such
chemicals in order to sustain basic bodily functions. Take, for
instance, cocaine addiction. Cocaine alters the means by which
brain cells communicate with one another. Usually, nerve cells
(neurons) send signals to one another through chemical
neurotransmitters such as dopamine. Dopamine flows from one
neuron to the other, delivers its message, and returns to the
original neuron. Cocaine, however, blocks the dopamine from
returning to the first cell, and the first cell just keeps firing
away. This explains why cocaine produces such feelings of
pleasure; for lack of a better description, cocaine locks all of
the user's neurons into an &quot;On&quot; position. The problem
occurs when all of the cocaine has been metabolized by the body.
As Professor James Q. Wilson explains, &quot;[w]hen the
exaggerated high produced by cocaine-influenced dopamine finally
ends, the brain cells may (in ways that are still a matter of
dispute) suffer from an extreme lack of dopamine, thereby making
the individual unable to experience any pleasure at all.&quot;3
This is a very simplified model, of course, and different drugs
affect the body in different ways, but a simple fact remains -
physical addiction is biochemical in nature and is independent of
social, political, or psychological causes. </p>

<p>There is another type of addiction, however, that being
psychological addiction. Unlike physical addiction, which
basically is a medical condition, psychological addiction occurs
when the individual user feels or is of the opinion that drugs
are necessary for his or her life. This is not to suggest that
psychological addiction is easily dismissed; indeed it can have a
profound influence on how addicts live their lives. Such
especially is the case when addicts live in a culture that
continually reinforces the desirability or necessity of drug use.
</p>

<p>Let us examine addiction specific to two drugs: cocaine and
marijuana. Although rough, estimates suggest that there are
between 650,000 and 2.4 million cocaine addicts in the United
States.4 &quot;Cocaine is a much more addictive drug than
alcohol. If cocaine were legally available the number of cocaine
abusers would probably rise to...perhaps 20-25million.&quot;5
Mitchell Rosenthal, President of the Phoenix House
drug-rehabilitation program states that cheap available drugs
would increase addiction; only 10% of drinkers become hooked,
while an estimated 75% of regular drug (crack) users could become
addicts.6 Scientific studies agree, noting that when given
unlimited access to cocaine, laboratory animals will consume
increasingly greater amounts until they die.7 That cocaine is
harmful to one's health likely will come as a surprise to no one.
Dr. Frank H. Gawin, director of stimulant abuse, treatment and
research at Yale University concludes that cocaine causes
depression, paranoia, and &quot;violent psychotic
behavior.&quot;8 What is worse, there is presently no effective,
permanent treatment for cocaine addiction.9 </p>

<p>Almost everyone would agree that cocaine is a dangerous,
addictive drug, but many would be surprised to find that the same
is true of marijuana. Although it is very difficult to determine
the precise number of marijuana users and addicts in the United
States, one fact is clear: marijuana has become much more potent
over the last twenty years. Cannabis delta 9
tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as &quot;THC,&quot; is the
active ingredient in marijuana and other cannabis such as
hashish. The THC content in marijuana during the days of
Woodstock was something less than 1%. In 1974, the average THC
content of illicit marijuana was 0. 36% and by 1984 had increased
to 4.40%.10 In 1992 in Alaska, marijuana was discovered that<b> </b>had
a THC content of 29.86%.11 Now stop and think about that for a
minute. Today's marijuana may be between thirty to sixty times as
potent as were the joints of the 1960's. </p>

<p>This observation gives one pause when we realize that THC is
both dangerous and habit-forming. Marinol, a prescription drug
that is very occasionally used in the treatment of nausea
associated with chemotherapy, is chemically synthesized THC. Most
people are familiar with the information sheets that come with
prescription drugs - the pieces of paper that detail the
indications and usage of the drug in question, its potential
side-effects, its chemical composition, etc. The information
sheet that comes with Marinol states verbatim, &quot;MARINOL is
highly abusable and can produce both physical and psychological
dependence .... Patients receiving MARINOL should be closely
observed.&quot;12 The company that produces Marinol goes on to
explain that its THC may cause &quot;changes in mood ...
decrements in cognitive performance and memory, a decreased
ability to control drives and impulses [and] . . . a full-blown
picture of psychosis (psychotic organic brain syndrome) may occur
in patients receiving doses within the lower portion of the
therapeutic range.&quot;13 </p>

<p>Such warnings should not surprise the scientists who have for
many years maintained that the THC contained in marijuana is
dangerous. First, in the late 1960's Dr. Robert Heath, then
chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology at Tulane
Medical School, found that marijuana affects brain waves and
destroys brain cells.14 Second, a study conducted by Dr. Ethel
Sassenrath at the University of California at Davis between 1974
and 1978 found that THC increased the rate of fetal loss (in
utero, fetal death) in monkeys by over 300%, while at the same
time decreasing the birth weights in those babies born alive.15
Third, a study by Dr. Susan Dalterio, at the University of Texas
found that marijuana decreased testosterone and impaired sexual
development in male mice.16 Finally, a study by Dr. Albert Munson
found that injections of THC suppressed the immune systems of
mice and made them 96 times more susceptible to the herpes
virus.17 </p>

<p>Dr. Charles R. Schuster, former Director of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse said, &quot;The fact that there are over
77,000 admissions a year to treatment programs for marijuana use
and that annually almost 8,000 persons require emergency hospital
care for marijuana use is sufficient evidence of the drugs
dangerousness&quot;18 </p>

<p>Clearly, drugs such as cocaine and marijuana are, both
addictive and dangerous. The legalizers likely would admit this,
but counter by saying that if we legalized them we would have
less of a problem. This is untrue. </p>

<p>Recall from above that legalizers claim that people use and
become addicted to drugs because of the excitement of breaking
the law - it is the fact that drugs are illegal that causes
people to try them. The data disagree. Robert E. Peterson, Former
Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania notes, &quot;70% of high
school students in New Jersey and about 60% of the students in
California said that fear of getting in trouble with the law
constituted a major reason <u>not</u> to use drugs.&quot;19 </p>

<p>The legalizers' argument that we should legalize drugs and
spend the money we now spend on criminal prosecution on treatment
and rehabilitation also fails. Both proponents and opponents of
legalization are in agreement that legalization almost certainly
would decrease the price of drugs as they became more available.
However, basic economic theory states that as the price of a
commodity declines, demand for the commodity will increase. But
whereas the reverse usually also is true (increase price and
demand decreases), it is not so with addictive substances. That
is, drop the price of a gram of cocaine by 50%, and you will see
an increase in use as demand for the product increases. Increase
the price of cocaine by 50%, and you will <i>not </i>see an equal
decrease in demand because addicts will pay the price to sustain
their addictions. In technical economic terms, the demand for
addictive drugs is elastic with respect to price declines, but
inelastic with respect to price increases. </p>

<p>Expert opinion supports this hypothesis. Dr. Herbert D. Kleber
of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, Columbia
University, suggests that legalization of cocaine would result in
a five- to six-fold increase in cocaine use.20 Dr. Robert DuPont,
former director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse agrees,
stating that legalization would increase the number of users of
cocaine and marijuana to between fifty and sixty million, and the
number of heroin users to around ten million.21 Dr. DuPont
concludes that when one takes into account the health effects of
cocaine, heroin, and marijuana, legalization could result in
between 100,000 and 500,000 drug induced deaths each year.22
Further, you cannot legalize cocaine and control the crack
epidemic, for users could easily turn the former into the latter.
</p>

<p>History also supports the fact that legalization would
increase addiction rates. When opium was legal in the United
States at the turn of the century, we had proportionately between
two and three times the number of addicts than we do presently.23
Furthermore, Dr. Richard Schwartz, Professor of Pediatrics at
Georgetown University School of Medicine, notes that Alaska and
Oregon, the states that traditionally have had the most lenient
drug laws, also have the highest marijuana addiction rates in the
United States double the national average.24 </p>

<p>Finally, foreign countries that have relaxed drug laws have
seen an increase in addiction rates [see Chapter Three]. </p>

<p>In short, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana are dangerous and
highly addictive substances. Scholarly opinion, historical
evidence, and common sense suggest that if these drugs are
legalized, then the rates of addiction will skyrocket, leading to
misery and death. </p>

<p>2 See Chapters Two and Four for additional discussion of
whether legalizing drugs would indeed allow us to shift resources
from criminal prosecution to treatment and rehabilitation. </p>

<p>Drug Legalization: Myths and Misconceptions</p>

<h2>Chapter Two: Crime and Drug Legalization </h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Discussion</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization advance two theories as to how
legalization will decrease crime in the United States, and both
are dependent on the assumption that legalization will reduce the
cost of drugs to the user. First, because users will not have to
spend as much to support their drug habits, fewer will need to
commit crimes such as robbery and burglary to obtain drug money.
Second, because the cost of drugs will decrease, so will the drug
sellers' profits. Because drugs will no longer be a profitable
business, and because addicts will be able to obtain their drugs
from legal sources, the current black market suppliers of drugs -
gangs, foreign cartels, organized criminals, etc.-will fade away.
</p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>Before addressing these theories, it is useful to distinguish
between three types of drug-related crime. As Professor James Q.
Wilson notes </p>

<p>[t]he illegality of drugs increases crime, partly because some
users turn to crime to pay for their habits, partly because some
users are stimulated by certain drugs (such as crack or PCP) to
act more violently or ruthlessly than they otherwise would, and
partly because criminal organizations seeking to control drug
supplies use force to manage their markets.25 </p>

<p>For ease of discussion, this author will refer to the crime
caused by people to pay for their habits as
&quot;purchase-related,&quot; the crime caused by people while
under the influence of drugs as &quot;drug-induced,&quot; and the
crime caused by organized criminal suppliers of drugs as
&quot;black market crime.&quot; Let us discuss each in turn. </p>

<p><b>A. Purchase-related crime</b> </p>

<p>As stated above, legalizers assume that as legalized drugs
become less expensive, addicts will no longer have to commit
crimes in order to fund their habits. One immediate difficulty
with this analysis is that drugs already are exceptionally
inexpensive. For example, a hit of crack costs about five dollars
on the streets of Seattle and about three dollars in other major
metropolitan areas.27 Granted, the pharmaceutical cost of cocaine
sufficient to make a hit of crack is roughly twenty-five cents.28
But to the extent that a legal crack supplier likely would have
to meet government regulations or would have to internalize the
costs of taxes placed upon the legalized drug, some analysts
question whether it is possible to reduce the current
street-price of drugs.29 </p>

<p>Nonetheless, let us assume that legal drug suppliers could
undersell the black market by offering cocaine for approximately
fifty cents a dose. What would happen? </p>

<p>As discussed at length in Chapter One, addiction rates would
skyrocket. This fact is almost indisputable, and even the
Libertarian supporters of drug legalization admit that &quot;low
prices would encourage use.&quot;30 History is very clear on this
point as well---once cocaine began being marketed in the high
potency/low cost form of crack, addiction rates did increase.31
And when addiction rates increase, so does purchase-related
crime. As Elliott Currie explains, &quot;[h]igher levels of drug
use <u>do</u> go hand in hand with increased crime, especially
property crime.&quot;32 </p>

<p>So in reality, legalizing drugs would not decrease
purchase-related crime, but would actually <i>increase </i>it.
Three reasons explain why this is so. First, if you decrease the
price of an addictive substance, addicts merely will buy more of
the<b> </b>less expensive product.33 Second, it is not as if
addicts steal money only to pay for drugs; likely, they steal
money to meet living expenses such as food, rent, etc. William
Bennett notes that &quot;[m]aking drugs legal would just be a way
of subsidizing [addicts] habit. They would continue to rob and
steal to pay for food, for clothes, for entertainment.&quot;34 Of
course, since there are more addicts, there would be more people
committing purchase-related crimes. Third, one must recall that
purchase-related crime is not directly related to the cost of the
drug, but instead is indirectly related: the prices of drugs
affect the addiction rate, which in turn affects the
purchase-related crime rate. This point perhaps is subtle, but
also is important. Addicts will pay almost any price for drugs.
Thus the question becomes not &quot;What is the price of
drugs,&quot; but instead &quot;How many addicts are there?&quot;
Because legalized drugs increase addiction rates,
purchase-related crime necessarily increases. </p>

<p><b>B. Drug-induced crime</b> </p>

<p>As with purchase-related crime, the price of drugs is not
directly relevant in determining the amount of drug-induced
crime, except to the extent that the price affects the number of
addicts. Undoubtedly, drug-induced crime is a significant
problem, One conservative estimate based upon the Bureau of
Justice Statistics study suggests that with regard to local jail
inmates, 15.4% of such inmates tested positive for illegal drugs
and an additional 12.1 % tested positive for a combination of
illegal drugs and alcohol.35 Another study conducted by the
National Institute of Justice in 1986 found that for twelve major
metropolitan areas, 70% of inmates tested positive for illegal
drugs.36 The N.I.J. study concluded that &quot;[these offenders
did not commit crimes simply to feed their habits. Drugs changed
their behavior, enabled and encouraged them to act violently and
irrationally.&quot;37 </p>

<p>Again, these results are unsurprising. Drugs such as crack
encourage hyperactive violence.38 If you legalize such drugs and
the addiction rate increases, you will have more people walking
around more often under its influence. It simply is untenable to
suggest that policies such as legalization that increase
addiction rates could do anything but increase the frequency of
drug-induced crime. </p>

<p><b>C. Black market crime</b> </p>

<p>As mentioned above, legalizers suggest that if you allow drugs
to be sold legally, it would drive out the black market, for the
latter only thrives when people cannot obtain goods through
normal, legal channels. Such analysis seems attractive at first,
but a closer look at the facts will prove that it is both
simplistic and incorrect. </p>

<p>So long as there are any restrictions as to what drugs were to
be legalized, who would be able to buy them, what quantities and
potencies were available, etc., a black market would fill the
need. For example, if the legalizers would limit the sale of
drugs to those people over twenty-one, then the black market
would target children. This argument is made by David T.
Courtwright, who finds potential black markets for &quot;those
under twenty-one, or for public-safety officers, or transport
workers, or military personnel, or pregnant women, or prisoners,
or probationers, or parolees, or psychotics. . . . &quot;39 In
order truly to defeat the black market, one not only would have
to allow anyone to buy drugs, but also would have to make all
forms of drugs available. William Rasberry explains that
&quot;[i]f marijuana and perhaps heroin are legalized, but not
crack cocaine and violence-inducing PCP, the effect on the crime
associated with drug trafficking would be minimal.&quot; Few, if
any, legalizers would be willing completely to legalize all drugs
for all people - but if they refuse to do so, they cannot
justifiably claim to have made a significant impact on black
market crime. </p>

<p>Another problem with the legalizers' argument is that many of
them advocate a policy whereby legalized drugs are taxed in order
to raise revenue for other social programs. But again, if you
legalize drugs and tax them, you will have a black market that
can sell the same drugs less expensively. The same is true if you
stamp a tariff on imported drugs, and history shows this to be
correct. Recall that until the early twentieth century, opiates
and other drugs were legal in the United States. Much of the
opium consumed by U.S. citizens was imported from China, and
&quot; enlightened lawmakers decided to place a tariff on the
drug as a means of raising revenue. For example, between 1866 and
1914, the duty on crude opium was 33%; on ready-to-smoke opium it
was 97%.41 Although these tariffs did produce income, they also
created a smuggler's paradise that organized crime syndicates
such as the Chinese tongs quickly filled. Criminals would smuggle
opium into the country, not pay the tariff, and make a higher
profit margin on their goods. Interestingly enough, at the peak
of the opium tariffs twice as much opium was smuggled into the
U.S. as went through legal channels.42 Thus, history proves that
if you place a tariff on imported drugs - be they legal or
illegal - black markets will continue to flourish unabated. </p>

<p>Let's return to the simple taxation of drugs produced within
the United States. Again, the equation is simple - tax equals
black market - and again, history proves it to be true. Take
tobacco for instance. Here is a legal commodity that potentially
can be taxed by both the federal government and any of the state
governments.43 Unsurprisingly, some states historically have had
higher cigarette taxes than others. In 1975, smokers in North
Carolina would pay thirty-six cents a pack whereas New Yorkers
had to pay fifty-four cents.44 Organized syndicates took
advantage of the situation, buying cigarettes in North Carolina
and selling them in New York for a profit-indeed at one point 50%
of all the cigarettes sold in New York City were bootlegged
products controlled by criminal organizations.45 Thus, proponents
of legalized drugs will never be able to stop the black market,
because the federal government, even if it wanted to, could not
stop state governments from taxing the drugs at different levels.
</p>

<p>Finally, with regard to the entire black market theories of
the legalizers, we have to remember the simple fact that
organized crime is composed of criminals. Query what the Cali or
the Medellin Cartel would do if they discovered that their
cocaine was being under priced by a legal manufacturer (let's say
a pharmaceutical company like Upjohn). What is the chance that
the Colombians would say &quot;Oh well, we just cannot compete in
the market. Let's close up shop and take real jobs.&quot;
Unlikely. Instead, currently entrenched crime syndicates would
use violence to ensure their place in the market.46 In the above
example, the Cali cartel might destroy Upjohn's laboratories. Or
it might murder everyone who sits on their Board of Directors. Or
it might take the less glamorous, but certainly more traditional,
strategy of telling addicts that if they don't buy their cocaine
from the cartel, they will be killed. In short, the belief that
if we legalize drugs then organized crime will run away with its
tail between its legs ignores grim reality. </p>

<p>In conclusion, drugs produce three types of crime:
purchase-related crime, drug-induced crime, and black market
crime. To the extent that legalizing drugs would make them
cheaper - a point on which all sides of the debate agree - it
would create many new addicts and the incidence of
purchase-related crime and drug-induced crime would increase.
Furthermore, if there were any regulations or taxes of <i>any
sort </i>placed upon the legalized drugs, U.S. history proves
that the black market crime would continue. Thus, legalizing
drugs not only does not decrease criminal behavior, it almost
certainly would spur its increase. </p>

<h2>Chapter Five: The Lessons of Prohibition and Drug
Legalization </h2>

<hr>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization suggest that the United States
experience with alcohol prohibition in the 1920's provides ample
proof of the problems that result when the government attempts to
make a popular substance illegal. Legalizers point to ostensible
increases in organized crime such as that associated with Al
Capone in order to make their point. Basically, they say, it is
better to legalize, tax and regulate than simply to declare drugs
illegal. </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>The legalizers' arguments here are deeply flawed and merit two
primary responses: first, the circumstances surrounding
Prohibition are so different than those of today's world that it
practically is impossible to use its history as a means of
analyzing present-day policy; second, Prohibition was in fact
successful and did not create the negative consequences that the
legalizers say it did. </p>

<p>But to the first point. David Teasley, an analyst with the
Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress,
undertook an in-depth analysis in 1992 entitled, &quot;Drug
legalization and the 'lessons' of Prohibition.&quot; Teasley
ultimately concluded that </p>

<p>[A] comprehensive analogy between Prohibition and the modern
drug problem is problematic in at least two major ways. First,
between the two eras there are significant differences that tend
to undermine the prolegalization analogy. Second, many arguments
of the prolegalizers are weakened by their reliance upon a widely
held set of popular beliefs about Prohibition rather than upon
recent historical evidence. Such attempts to create this analogy
based upon these popular beliefs about Prohibition serve only to
confuse the debate over legalization of illicit drugs.97 </p>

<p>Let us examine the differences that Teasley (and others) cite
between the era of Prohibition and the era in which we now live. </p>

<p>First, during prohibition the government sought to restrict
the consumption of alcohol although it lacked the moral consensus
of the nation. That is, even during Prohibition, most people were
accepting of alcohol.98 Such is not the case today, for the vast
majority of citizens do feel that illicit drugs should remain
illegal [see Chapter Eleven]. Thus, Prohibition went against the
national consensus whereas illegalization of drugs does not. </p>

<p>Second, the laws of Prohibition themselves were different than
those dealing with illicit drugs today. During Prohibition, it
was not illegal to drink alcohol, it was only illegal to sell it.
Today, however, it is both illegal to sell and to use illicit
drugs. Consequently, today's laws can target the users while
those of the Prohibition era could not.99 </p>

<p>Third, during the Prohibition era several states did not
support the federal laws. This fact created tension between the
state and federal governments and hampered effective prosecution
of alcohol distributors. Today, 48 states have signed the Uniform
Controlled Substances Act, and all are in effective agreement
with the federal government in matters of drug policy - a
state/federal consensus exists that was not present during
Prohibition.100 </p>

<p>Fourth, criminal penalties are much more severe today than in
the 1920's. For example, the first-offense bootlegger faced a
maximum fine of $ 1,000 or six months in prison. Today, a
first-offense trafficker of cocaine or heroin (of less than 100
grams) faces fines up to $1 million and imprisonment for up to 20
years.101 </p>

<p>Fifth, during Prohibition the United States was a
&quot;dry&quot; nation within a &quot;wet&quot; international
community. Just as the Prohibition policies were counter to the
moral consensus within the U.S., they were also at odds with that
of the international community (which explains why so much
alcohol was imported from Canada). But as discussed in Chapter
Three, the international community is resolute when it comes to
drug policy; in December of 1988 over 80 countries signed the
Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances.102 Sixth and finally, the administrative
structure of the government agencies designed to carry out the
Prohibition laws was narrow, unstable, and filled with political
appointees. Today's national drug strategy involves over a dozen
federal agencies coordinated by the Office of National Drug
Control Policy. In short, the governmental bodies that prosecute
today's drug violators are much larger, have much better
resources, and are much more professional than their Prohibition
counterparts.103 </p>

<p>Thus, it is factually incorrect for the legalizers to
analogize our history with Prohibition to today's drug policies.
They simply do not have that much in common. But should the
legalizers choose to make such an analogy, they also should be
made aware of the fact that Prohibition was on balance a
successful program. </p>

<p>First, use of alcohol decreased significantly during
Prohibition.104 This decrease in turn lead to a marked decrease
in the incidence of cirrhosis of the liver.105 Also,
alcohol-related arrests decreased 50%. 106 Finally, the suicide
rate also decreased by 50%.107 </p>

<p>A second reason why Prohibition was a successful program is
due to the fact that it did not -- contrary to popular myth --
cause an increase in the crime rate. It is true that there was an
increase in the homicide rate during Prohibition, but this is not
the same as an increase in the overall crime rate. Furthermore,
the increase in homicide occurred predominantly in the
African-American community, and African-Americans at that time
were not the people responsible for alcohol trafficking.108 The
drama of Elliot Ness and Al Capone largely was just that, drama
sensationalized by the media of the time. </p>

<p>In short, it is doubtful that one legitimately may analogize
Prohibition with our current efforts to control drugs. There are
too many differences in the laws, the political establishment,
the moral consensus, and the international community to make such
analogizing worthwhile. Nonetheless, the fact remains that
Prohibition accomplished many of its goals, improved the health
of the entire nation, and did not cause a significant increase in
the crime rate. Mark Kleinman, who has proposed legalizing
marijuana109 notes, the U.S. experience with Prohibition is the
best evidence to support the continued illegalization of illicit
drugs.110 </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then
you say...</b> </p>

<p>Whereas there was not a moral consensus for Prohibition U.S.
citizens overwhelmingly are in favor of the the continued
illegalization of illicit drugs. [Robert E. Peterson, &quot;Stop
Legalization of Illegal Drugs;&quot; Drug Awareness Information
Newsletter, July 1988]. </p>

<p>During Prohibition, only the sale, and not the use, of alcohol
was illegal. Today, both sale and use of illicit drugs are
illegal. Consequently, present drug policies can target users
whereas Prohibition laws could not. [David L. Teasley, &quot;Drug
legalization and the 'lessons' of Prohibition,&quot; Contemporary
Drug Problems, Spring 1992]. </p>

<p>During Prohibition, there was much tension between federal and
state alcohol policy. Today, 48 states have signed the Uniform
Controlled Substances Act, and the federal and state governments
work in concert. [David Teasley, citation above]. </p>

<p>During Prohibition, criminal sanctions were not extreme - a
first-time bootlegger could receive a $1,000 fine or six months
in prison. Today, fines for first-time cocaine or heroin
trafficking are up to $1 million and prison sentences go as high
as 20 years. [David Teasley, citation above). </p>

<p>During Prohibition, the U.S. was a &quot;dry&quot; country in
a &quot;wet&quot; international community. Today, almost all
countries are in agreement that drugs should be illegal, as
witnessed by the fact that 80 countries signed the 1988
Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances. [David Teasley, citation above]. </p>

<p>The political administration responsible for enforcing
Prohibition was small, underfunded, and unprofessional. In
contrast, the current drug control program is run by over a dozen
agencies coordinated by the Office of National Drug Control
Policy. [David Teasley, citation above]. </p>

<p>Prohibition caused more harm than good. </p>

<p>During Prohibition, alcohol use declined significantly [David
Teasley, citation above]. </p>

<p>During Prohibition, incidence of cirrhosis of the liver
decreased by 35%. [Charles Krauthammer, &quot;Legalize? No,

<p>During Prohibition, the suicide rate decreased 50%. [Robert
Stutman, &quot;Reasons Not to Legalize Drugs,&quot; Drug
Awareness Information Newsletter]. </p>

<p>During Prohibition, the incidence of alcohol-related arrests
also declined by 50% [Robert L. DuPont, &quot;The Case Against
Legalizing Drugs,&quot; Drug Awareness Information Newsletter]. </p>

<p>Contrary to popular opinion, the crime rate did not markedly
increase during prohibition. What did increase was the homicide
rate (not the same as the overall crime rate) among
African-Americans. And African-Americans had little to do with
alcohol trafficking. [David Teasley, citation above]. </p>

<p>Mark Kleiman admits that the U.S. experience with Prohibition
is one of the strongest arguments in favor of the continued
illegalization of illicit drugs. [Letter from John C. Lawn to
Joseph E. DiGenova, Drug Enforcement Administration, June 3,
1988]. <br>

<TITLE>1994 Iowa Legislative Survey</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><FONT SIZE=6><B><CENTER>1994 Iowa Legislative Survey</CENTER></B></FONT><P>
     Last December, we sent a medical marijuana survey to all 150 members of the newly elected Iowa Legislature, asking for support for a resolution calling upon the federal government to make marijuana medically available by a doctor's prescription, and asking that the medical necessity defense be enacted into Iowa law.  Two Iowa Senators, Merlin Bartz (Republican, Grafton) and Elaine Szymoniak (Democrat, Des Moines), have agreed to draft legislation for us and have assigned interns to work on our suggestions.  We're extremely optimistic that at the least we will get a public hearing on our proposals in the Iowa Senate this year.  It would be extremely helpful if you'd sit down right now and write a letter to one or more of our supporters in the Iowa Senate expressing your support.  You can write to them at the Iowa Statehouse, Des Moines, Iowa 50319, or at their home addresses (listed below).
<P>
     Here are the responses we've received so far from our legislative survey:

Press Release:                                      Contact:   Carl Olsen
November 23, 1995                                              515-262-6957

<h1><center>Iowa Legislative Survey Results</center></h1>
<pre><b>     Iowans for Medical Marijuana sent a Legislative Questionnaire to each 
of the 100 members of the Iowa House of Representatives and to each of the 
50 members of the Iowa Senate.  Our questionnaire asked: "Will you lend 
your support in demanding that the Federal Government allow Iowans with 
legitimate medical needs to use marijuana for medical purposes?"  We 
received 43 replies from the Iowa House of Representatives (43%), and 16 
replies from the Iowa Senate (32%).  10 of those responding in the Iowa 
House of Representatives were in favor of our proposal, 21 of those 
responding were unsure, and 13 of those responding were opposed.  10 of 
those responding in the Iowa Senate were in favor of our proposal, 5 were 
unsure, and 2 were opposed.  The results seem to better than last year.  
Last year, 3 of those responding in the Iowa House of Representatives were 
in favor of our proposal, 7 were unsure, and 8 were opposed, while 7 of 
those responding in the Iowa Senate were in favor, 3 were unsure, and none 
were opposed.  The response to the survey was much better this year than 
last year.

     Carl Olsen, coordinator for Iowans for Medical Marijuana, said, "We're 
doing a good job of educating the Legislature about the medical benefits of 
marijuana.  Many of them were unaware of the present conflict between state 
and federal law."  Since 1979, Iowa law has allowed prescription of 
marijuana.  Federal law has never allowed prescription of marijuana, but 
the federal government had been supplying marijuana to patients on a 
selective basis under a program of compassionate care.  In 1992 the federal 
government decided to stop accepting new applications for its compassionate 
care marijuana program.  Only eight Americans remain on the federal program 
and two of them live in Iowa.  Olsen said, "Health care should be a basic 
fundamental right for everyone, not just the eight people who now receive 
federally grown marijuana.  It's time the federal government stopped 
playing games with people's lives and allowed doctors to prescribe 
marijuana to all patients who need it."

     A federal bill, H.R. 2618, similar to Iowa's medical marijuana law, 
Iowa Code  124.206(7)(a), was introduced in the U.S. House of 
Representatives on Monday, November 13, 1995.

<p>Myths and Misconceptions of Drug Legalization: US Dept. of
Justice</p>

<h2>Chapter Four: The Economics of Drug Legalization </h2>

<hr>

<p><b>Discussion</b> </p>

<p><b>1. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization suggest that their policy will save
society money for several reasons. First, we will not have to pay
police to enforce the present criminal-justice approach to drug
usage. Second, we will be able to tax legal drugs, thereby
raising revenue. </p>

<p>II. <b>Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>It should be stated initially that most people misconceive the
amount of resources expended under the status quo for drug
control. The FY 1994 federal budget allocates $7.51 billion for
drug control (supply reduction) which includes criminal justice,
interdiction, international programs and intelligence.81 State
and local governments spend even more, $12.6 billion a year.82
Granted, this is a lot of money, but we should put these numbers
in perspective. Americans spend about four billion dollars each
summer for air conditioning.83 The citizens of Washington State
spend $1.4 billion each year on legal gambling alone.84 The
national debt numbers in the trillions of dollars. One Stealth
Bomber runs half a billion dollars. Indeed, only 1.4% of total
government spending goes for law enforcement of all types, and an
additional 1.0% for prosecution and prisons.85 Out of this small
percentage, 12% of spending for law enforcement was allocated to
drug control activities, and about 25% of correctional (prison)
spending was drug related.86 Only 1.5% of total state and local
government spending is attributed to drug control activities.87
Thus, when taken in context, it is apparent that the costs of
criminalized drugs nowhere approaches the financial obligations
of government programs such as national defense, Social Security,
or Medicare. </p>

<p>More important, if we legalized drugs on the assumption that
by taxing them we could raise large amounts of revenue, we would
be sadly mistaken. First, as discussed in Chapter Two, any such
taxation scheme would perpetuate a criminal black market.
Consequently, we would still have to spend money funding police,
courts and the like to fight this problem. Second, if alcohol is
any indication, we simply would not make that much money by
taxing drugs. The total revenue collected from alcohol taxes at
the federal, state, and local levels amounts to about $13.1
billion a year,&quot; a paltry sum compared to the social costs
associated with alcohol consumption - something in the
neighborhood of $100 billion.&quot; Third, how would we structure
a tax scheme for drugs? If we wanted to correlate higher taxes
with higher risk behavior, logically we would tax the fifth joint
more than the first (inasmuch as the fifth joint probably is more
damaging to one's health). And wouldn't it cost money to create
the governmental bureaucracy that would handle this taxation
policy? </p>

<p>Thus, we do not spend that much on the drug war in comparison
to other governmental programs, and taxation of legalized drugs
would not result in that much revenue. But by far the most
compelling economic argument against the legalization of drugs is
the social costs associated with such a policy. </p>

<p>First, treating drug addicts is enormously expensive. Take
crack babies as an example. In 1988, it cost $2.5 billion for the
intensive care needed to keep the babies alive after birth.90 But
that was just the beginning of the expenses. It is estimated that
it will cost $15 billion to prepare these children for
kindergarten,91 and will then cost between $6 billion and $12
billion for every year of special learning programs.92 Even
assuming the low-ball figure, the social costs of educating all
of the crack babies born in 1988 -<i> not all crack babies, mind
you, just those born that year</i> - will run approximately $90
billion by the time they graduate from high school. Now to the
extent that legalization will increase the drug addiction rates
enormously [see Chapter One], legalization seems like a very
expensive policy indeed. And who will foot the bill? Either
common citizens will through taxes for government aid programs,
or through increased insurance premiums.93 </p>

<p>But treatment costs are just the first way in which drug
addiction drains society. Already, drug addicts cost the country
roughly $33 billion dollars a year in lost productivity and
job-related accidents, according to a study conducted in 1987 by
the Research Triangle Institute of Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina.94 If legalized, addiction rates would increase and the
cost would rise to between $140 billion and $210 billion a
year.95 And who will pay for lost productivity and job-related
accidents? Consumers will, of course, in the final costs of the
produced goods. </p>

<p>Finally we must consider human lives in the economic calculus.
As drug abuse causes more job related accidents, more people will
be hurt or killed. Take, for example, the Conrail/Amtrak disaster
of January 4, 1987. Because an engineer and a brakeman were high
on marijuana, their train collided with another, killing sixteen
people and injuring 175.96 </p>

<p>So go back to the beginning. We spend approximately $20
billion a year on drug control activities. If drugs were
legalized, we would see an increase in addiction rates.
Consequently we would have more crack babies (the kind that
already will cost the system $90 billion), decreased productivity
(at a cost of between $140 billion and $210 billion), more
job-related accidents, and more dead people. And given the
potential black market effect, it is unlikely that we could raise
even several billion dollars in tax revenue. From a purely
economic standpoint, legalization is not cost effective. </p>

<p>If you try to tax legalized drugs, you will create a black

<p>This was tried with alcohol. It Failed. Federal, state, and
local alcohol taxes combined raise approximately $13.1 billion
dollars a year, but alcohol extracts over $ 100 billion a year in
social costs such as lost productivity and health costs. [Morton

<p>Addicts require treatment, and this is enormously expensive.

for kindergarten. Further, special learning programs will cost

kindergarten. By the time they graduate from high school, this
yields a total of roughly $90 billion. [A.M. Rosenthal, &quot;How
Much Is a Baby Worth?&quot; New York Times, December 15, 1989]. </p>

<p>If we legalize drugs, it will cost society between $140
billion and $210 billion a year in lost productivity and
job-related accidents. [Morton M. Kondracke, citation above]. </p>

<p>If we legalize drugs, consumers will bear the ultimate
responsibility for the bill because of increases in insurance
premiums and higher costs of manufactured goods. [&quot;No Magic

<h2>Chapter Eight: Individual Rights and the Legalization of
Drugs </h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Although proponents of legalization do not rely upon this
argument very much any more, a traditional response of the
legalizers was that &quot;It's my body and I have a right to do
with it as I please so long as I'm the only one affected.&quot;
This is called the Individual Autonomy argument. </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>The obvious flaw with the Individual Autonomy argument, and
the reason why it is not used much any more, is the simple fact
that drug use does affect other people. Indeed, this entire
manual is in large part a collection of reasons and examples as
to how drug use affects not only the individual, but also
innocent third-parties and society at large. But for the sake of
clarity, let us iterate and expand upon these points. </p>

<p>First, drug use increases crime - and consequently harms other
people - in at least three different ways. For a discussion of
this, please see Chapter Two. </p>

<p>Second, drug use by pregnant women causes in utero damage to
the fetus. Children born of cocaine mothers have three times the
mortality rate and four times the low birth-weight as children
born of normal mothers.143 Similarly, &quot;coke babies&quot;
tend to have emotional traits similar to those found in people
with antisocial personality disorders.144 Unfortunately, the same
mothers who are most likely to damage their children in this way
are also the least likely to seek professional help and
treatment.145 </p>

<p>Third, drug abuse closely correlates to child abuse. For
example, in Philadelphia, cocaine is implicated in half of the
cases in which parents beat their children to death, and in 80%
of all abuse cases. 146 In the District of Columbia, 90% of those
reported for child abuse were substance abusers. 147 In 1984 the
Legal Aid Society in New York City handled 3,3 10 abuse and
neglect cases in the city. By 1989 it was handling more than
24,000.148 What happened? Crack did, beginning in 1985. Sixty
percent of abuse and neglect cases involved drug allegations. 149
The number of children wounded and killed by stray bullets in
tragic drive-by shootings pales in comparison to the impact of
cocaine in the over 1,200 child abuse murders in 1989.150 But
these problems are not mere statistics - they are horror stories.
In San Francisco, a woman who was freebasing cocaine gave birth
to twins on her living room floor. She continued to freebase and
let her children die unattended. </p>

<p>Fourth, drug use, like alcohol use, is responsible for a large
percentage of automobile accidents in the United States. In
Maryland, 32% of car crash victims tested positive for
marijuana.152 </p>

<p>Fifth, drug use among pilots and train operators also leads to
accidents. Recall the Conrail disaster discussed in Chapter Four,
wherein 16 people were killed and 175 were injured because the
train operators were high on marijuana. Furthermore, a study
conducted by Stanford University found that 24 hours after
smoking one joint, pilots could not safely land a plane.153 </p>

<p>Sixth and finally, consider all of the economic and social
costs associated with drug use in our </p>

<p>society-costs that equate to tens of billions of dollars in
lost productivity, higher taxes, and increased insurance
premiums. </p>

<p>In short, few people use the Individual Autonomy argument any
more because it is painfully </p>

<p>obvious that drug use affects not only the individual user,
but also the user's family, innocent third parties, and society
as a whole. </p>

<p>Drug use causes increased crime. [see<b> </b>Chapter Two]. </p>

<p>Drug use by pregnant mothers causes in utero damage to the
fetus. Specifically, it increases the risk of mortality
three-fold and the risk of low birth-weight four-fold. [Ken
Auletta, &quot;Six doses of reality are injected in the argument

accidents. Recall the Conrail disaster discussed in Chapter Four,
in which 16 people died and 175 were injured. [see Chapter Four].

hours after smoking one joint, pilots could not safely land a
plane. [Rosanna Creighton &amp; Jeffrey Kushner, &quot;Legalizing
Drugs is Not the Answer,&quot; Drug Awareness Information

<p>Drug use costs society billions of dollars in lost
productivity, taxes, and higher insurance premiums. [see Chapter
Four]. <br>

<P>
	This has been going on for too many years now.  Local MS sufferer Barbara Douglass is again going to a rally at the capitol to plead for the legalized use of medicinal marijuana. <P>
	Despite all of the study, all of the talk and all of the need, lawmakers are still dragging their feet on this issue.  It seems both cruel and ridiculous. <P>
	Doctors have prescribed marijuana for relief of the pain that accompanies several chronic conditions, including AIDS.  Barbara Douglass can tell you what it has meant to her condition. <P>
	Dont get us wrong.  Marijuana is a drug.  We are not calling for it to be legalized for recreational use, or treated as anything less than a potent drug. <P>
	It should be controlled by doctors who can fully inform users of its benefits and limitations -- most definitely operation of a motor vehicle.  It should be controlled by prescriptions, as are so many important drugs with much stronger effects on the body.  And like other prescription drugs, the laws should stomp hard on those who obtain or use it illegally. <P>
	We must get to that point where we can separate marijuana as a prescription medicine from the war on drugs, which we continue to support with all of our hearts.  We can accept the former without giving an inch on the latter. <P>
	Once again, they will rally this August on the steps of the capitol, while the people who work in there ignore the plea. <P>
	How in the world can the federal government and state board of pharmacy examiners expressly approve of the use of medicinal marijuana for relief of Barbara Douglass condition, then deny it to others with the same condition or those similar in terms of chronic pain and debilitation? <P>
	Maybe it is the politicians blocking this use who need a medicinal dose... <P>
	Of compassion. <P>

	It's been a taxing, uphill battle the entire way, but Barb Douglass and <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">George McMahon</A> refuse to give up.  The two advocate the legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes, so that those who need it and want it can get it. <P>
	Just back from a two-day National Conference on Marijuana Use Prevention, Treatment and Research sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institutes of Health in Washington, D.C., the two were given some hope that their perseverance has not been in vain and hope remains that somewhere in the not too distant future, marijuana will once again be available for medicinal purposes. <P>
	This Saturday they continue their battle in Des Moines as Iowan's for Medical Marijuana rally at noon on the West Steps of the Capitol Building to publicize their cause and try to get lawmakers' support. <P>
	Marijuana, they claim, is a "miracle drug" and politics is getting in the way of medicine, causing needless suffering and mental anguish on the part of patients. <P>
	Their opinion -- although neither are a doctor or scientist -- carries weight.  Douglass, who lives in Lakeside, and <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>, of Bode, are two of only eight medical patients in the United States who are legally prescribed marijuana. <P>
	Every month, the two receive 300 marijuana cigarettes from the federal government as part of what is now a "21-year experiment" to evaluate the benefits for marijuana on specific illnesses.  Douglass, who has been on the program since 1991, and <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>, who has been on the program since 1990, are prescribed 10 cigarettes a day to help ease their pain.  Douglass, who at one time was blind from multiple sclerosis, is now only legally blind and she credits marijuana for the partial restoration of her sight.  The drug also acts as a relaxant for the spasticity that occurs in her legs due to MS. <P>
	<a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>, who suffers from a neurological disorder called Nail Patella Syndrome causing muscle spasms and brittle bones, has had 20 operations to date and is in a constant state of pain.  Marijuana not only eases that pain, it improved his condition, relaxing muscle spasms without the awful side effects that other legal prescription drugs induce, according to <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>. <P>
	While disappointed that the Washington, D.C. conference officially spoke towards the harmful effects of illegal drug use from state department heads and ways to keep juveniles and adults away from drug use, privately, Douglass and <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>, who were invited to the conference, received solid support from the audience full of counselors, doctors and scientists.  "It wasn't the scientific convention we thought it was going to be," Douglass said. <P>
	However, support is growing for their cause and <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> can feel it.  Today, 36 states have passed laws that allow marijuana for medical use with Iowa being one of them.  Debate among physicians about prescribing marijuana is getting louder in some circles although doctors still remain fearful about promoting it, afraid that there will be a mad dash to their door, according to <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>.  In June an article entitled "Marijuana as Medicine: A Plea for Reconsideration" was published by two doctors in the American Medical Association to add to the list of professionals supporting the drug for medical use. <P>
	The article claims much of what marijuana patients have testified to -- marijuana has been found useful as an anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant in spastic disorders, as an appetite stimulant in the wasting syndrome of human immunodeficiency virus infection and is also useful for relieving phantom limb pain and menstrual cramps.  It has also been helpful in treating glaucoma, nausea from chemotherapy in cancer patients, epilepsy, arthritis, MS and spinal fluid injuries. <P>
	The problem, <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> said, remains among law enforcement and the Drug Enforcement Administration, which adamantly opposes any legalization of marijuana. <P>
	A bill is anticipated in Congress hopefully within this year or next to legalize marijuana use for medical purposes.  <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> and Douglass said they have been contacted by Barney Frank and Pat Buchanan for input on possible legislation for debate by lawmakers. <P>
	"The problem we have now, is not telling senators to support us, privately, many of them already do, but to tell others.  Their problem is they don't know who to talk to," <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> said. <P>
	Other organizations advocating the legalization of marijuana for recreational use are also muddying up the issue, <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> claims.  "They're doing their ever loving best to help us at the same time they promote their cause, but we're not worried about that.  That's not what we stand for, that's not what we're after," he said. <P>
	While <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> and Douglass hope that one day all of those suffering from illnesses have access to marijuana, their immediate mission remains smaller and much more personal.  Both would like to see their friend Ladd Huffman, a Vietnam veteran suffering from MS, and McMahon's daughter Linda, who also suffers from the same genetic disorder as her father, given permission to use marijuana for their illnesses.  Huffman was already approved as a marijuana patient for the same program that <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> and Douglass are in but the program was put on hold in 1992 and no one besides the eight already receiving marijuana were given the drug. <P>

<h2>Chapter Six: The Role of Alcohol and Tobacco in the Drug
Legalization Debate </h2>

<hr>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p>I. <b>Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of drug legalization advance the argument that to
the extent alcohol and tobacco may be freely consumed, it is
hypocritical to make other drugs such as marijuana and cocaine
illegal. They cite the individual and social harm caused by both
tobacco and alcohol to support their argument. </p>

<p><b>II. Our</b> <b>Argument</b> </p>

<p>Two responses immediately come to mind when addressing the
legalizers' argument. First, simply because we have as a society
have chosen to legalize some dangerous substances does not lead
to the conclusion that we should legalize all dangerous
substances. Second, the legalizers' argument is logically flawed:
When they compare the damage caused by alcohol and tobacco to
that caused by drugs such as cocaine and marijuana they are
comparing apples and oranges (or more specifically, legal to
illegal drugs). Alcohol and tobacco are legal, and, according to
our analysis in Chapter One [Addiction Rates], are used much more
frequently than illegal drugs. Because their use is greater, the
amount of damage they cause will also be greater. But this is not
to say that one &quot;dose&quot; of alcohol is inherently more
dangerous than one &quot;dose&quot; of cocaine. As James Q.
Wilson explains, predictions about the harms of cocaine that
assume its illegality tells us little about what damage cocaine
would do if it were legal.111 Thus, the proper analysis is not to
compare damage caused by cocaine to that caused by alcohol under
the present system, but instead is to compare the harm likely
caused by <i>legalized </i>cocaine to that caused by alcohol. </p>

<p>But let us look more closely at the legalizers' position
itself. </p>

<p><b>1. Tobacco.</b> Certainly tobacco kills people.
Nonetheless, it is disingenuous to say that as such it is a more
dangerous substance than either cocaine or marijuana. For while
it may harm one's health, tobacco does not affect one's
intellectual processing or decision-making ability. As Professor
Wilson explains: </p>

<p>Tobacco shortens one's life, cocaine debases it.<b> </b>Nicotine
alters one's habits, cocaine alters one's soul. The heavy use of
crack, unlike the heavy use of tobacco, corrodes those natural
sentiments of sympathy and duty that constitute our human nature
and make possible our social life.&quot;' </p>

<p>Think of it this way: Research fairly convincingly has
demonstrated that cholesterol is bad for people, and in fact may
be responsible for a large amount of heart disease in the United
States. In essence, cholesterol kills. But to take this premise
and then argue that because we allow people to eat red meat we
should also allow them to smoke crack is both unsophisticated and
unpersuasive reasoning. Similarly, to argue that because we do
not allow people to smoke crack we should not allow them to eat
red meat also displays a rather monumental lack of common sense.
And although cholesterol may kill you, it does not lead to the
types of bizarre, destructive behavior that is associated with
most illegal drugs. </p>

<p>2. <b>Alcohol. </b>Alcohol is somewhat harder to justify, for
not only can it kill people but it does in fact alter one's
behavior and may encourage antisocial and destructive activity.
But again, this admission does not me-an that one must view
alcohol and cocaine as equivalent. First, a far greater
percentage of people who use cocaine become addicted to the
substance than do people who use alcohol. Recall that in Chapter
One, we discovered that the addiction rate for cocaine may be as
high as 75%.113 Conversely, the addiction rate for alcohol is
about 10%.114 One<b> </b>is thus far more likely to become
addicted to cocaine than to alcohol. Second, the relapse rate
(the percentage of people who quit the drug who later begin to
take it again), is much higher for cocaine.115 </p>

<p>In short, do not let proponents of legalization argue that
just because tobacco and alcohol are legal, so too should be
cocaine and marijuana. First, just because we sanction some
dangerous substances does not mean that we should allow all of
them. Second, it is misleading to compare the damage caused by
legal drugs with that caused by illegal drugs -- instead we
should compare the risks of alcohol and tobacco with those of <i>legalized
</i>cocaine and marijuana. Likely we would find that the latter
are much more dangerous than the former. </p>

<p>Third, tobacco does not alter one's behavior and encourage
violent behavior as do many illegal drugs. Fourth, alcohol, while
admittedly dangerous, is much less addictive than presently
illegal drugs and also is easier to quit once addicted. Do not
compound problems simply because they are difficult to solve-keep
illegal drugs illegal and at the same time try to discourage
alcohol and tobacco use. </p>

<p>Just because some dangerous substances are legal does not mean
that all dangerous substances should also be legal. </p>

<p>One cannot properly compare the harm associated with tobacco
and alcohol use with the harm associated with cocaine and
marijuana use, because you are comparing legal drugs with illegal
drugs. And as discussed in Chapter One, legalizing a drug makes
it more dangerous. (See last paragraph, page 7). </p>

<p>Although tobacco harms one's health, it does not alter one's
mental processes, nor does it create bizarre, violent behavior.
[James Q. Wilson, &quot;Against the Legalization of Drugs,&quot;
Commentary, February 1990]. </p>

<p>Although alcohol is harmful, it is much less addictive than
cocaine: Studies suggest that alcohol has an addiction rate of
10%, whereas cocaine has an addiction rate as high as 75%.
[George Church. &quot;Thinking<b> </b>the Unthinkable,&quot;'
Time, May 30, 1988]. </p>

<p>Do not legalize drugs because alcohol and tobacco are harmful:
keep illegal drugs illegal and try to decrease use of the others.

<p>Myths and Misconceptions of Drug Legalization - US Dept. of
Justice</p>

<h2>Chapter Nine: Legal Issues Surrounding the Legalization of
Drugs </h2>

<hr>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>This chapter deals not with an argument of the legalizers per
se, but instead their implicit belief </p>

<p>that legalizing drugs would not have a profound effect on
other facets of law and public policy. </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>Basically, we have three concerns here. </p>

<p>First, can drug use be used as a defense in criminal or civil
proceedings? That is, can a person </p>

<p>accused of a hit-and-run accident escape liability by noting
to the court that he was on cocaine at the time? </p>

<p>Second, what will be done with the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)? As its name suggests, the FDA is
responsible for testing the safety of food and drugs in the
United States. For example, the FDA banned the use of Red Dye #2
a number of years ago because it caused cancer (this is why there
were no red M+M's in most of the 1980's - it was not until the
candy producer came up with a noncarcenogenic dye that they
started making them again in the late 1980's). Similarly, the FDA
banned the use of the substance known as Laetrile when it
determined that this supposed drug had absolutely no
pharmacological effects. But if we allow the legal sale of drugs
such as cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and PCP - that unquestionably
are dangerous - how can we justify allowing the FDA to exercise
quality control over any other type of drugs? To allow the sale
and use of cocaine while still granting the FDA power to
regulate, say, food additives such as saccharine is like banning
slingshots but allowing people to carry automatic assault rifles.
So if we legalize the sale and use of clearly dangerous drugs, it
seems that to be logically consistent we would have to close down
the FDA and let everyone have access to every type of drug. And
given legalized drugs it also seems hypocritical to have any type
of quality control on food additives or food products more
generally. </p>

<p>A third and final concern is the legal liability of the
companies that would manufacture and sell the newly legalized
cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and PCP. This is a very important
argument, and in order to fully understand its magnitude we must
mention what are known as &quot;Dram Shop&quot; laws. If not in
name, we are all familiar with what a Dram Shop law is - it is a
law that says that if bartenders continue to serve alcohol to
people that they know are already drunk, and that drunk person
later goes out and commits a crime such as drunk driving, then
the bartender or the bar can be held responsible. So the question
remains: would producers and sellers of legalized drugs be
responsible for the actions of the people who ingest them? If the
producers and sellers <i>would not </i>be liable, we have a
serious ethical problem inasmuch as they could destroy peoples'
lives with impunity in the name of profit and not be held morally
accountable. But if the producers and sellers would be liable --
that is, a Dram Shop type of law would apply to them --we would
probably have very few companies willing to market and sell
drugs. Put differently, if a given drug company knew that it
could be hit with a ten million dollar lawsuit when one of its
clients goes and kills someone (or damages property, etc.), is
that company likely to stay in business? Not likely. The company
likely would decide that the costs of doing business outweigh the
potential benefits and thus would close down shop. For proof of
this point ask yourself the following: How many companies are
there in the U.S. today that manufacture and sell asbestos
insulation? Answer: probably none. </p>

<p>In short, there are many legal and political issues that would
have to be dealt with if we legalized </p>

<p>drugs, and nowhere in the legalizers' literature have they
come up with adequate answers to these problems. </p>

<p>We can legalize drugs without any legal difficulties. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then
you say...</b> </p>

<p>If we legalize drugs, will drug use be able to be used as a
defense in criminal and civil trials? </p>

<p>If we legalize drugs, would not we logically have to close
down the Food and Drug Administration and dispense with all laws
regulating the safety and quality of drugs, food additives and
food products? </p>

<p>If we legalize drugs, would manufacturers and sellers be
liable for the actions of the people whom they sell drugs to? If
not, isn't there an ethical problem here? If so, can we
realistically expect anyone to enter the drug<b> </b>business? <br>

<p>Myths and Misconceptions of Drug Legalization: US Dept. of
Justice</p>

<h2>Chapter Ten: Environmental Issues and the Legalization of
Drugs </h2>

<hr>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Some extremists in the drug legalization debate suggest that
we should legalize hemp - the plant from which we get marijuana -
because hemp could be used as fiber to make clothing,
alternatives to lumber, paper products, and the like. </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>Some of the arguments of the legalizers are at least plausible
(plausible, but wrong). This is not one of them. The argument
that we should grow hemp for fiber is completely absurd. First,
if hemp is such a good all-purpose fiber, why isn't any country
in the world seriously growing it? Second, there was a time in
the U.S. when it was legal to grow hemp (before 1937), and no one
did. By 1937, so few people chose to grow hemp that it wasn't
even mentioned in Department of Agriculture or Department of
Commerce reports.154 If it is such a good idea, why didn't anyone
do it when they could have? </p>

<p>Finally, assume (although this assumption is contradicted by
history) that hemp could provide all of the environmental
benefits that the legalizers claim. These benefits would still
have to be weighed against the costs of allowing farmers to grow
thousands, if not millions, of acres of marijuana. It would be
impossible to have a policy that allowed the legal sale of hemp
for fiber but not for smoking, for one simply could not enforce
it. (By comparison, think of how plausible a policy would be that
said farmers could grow wheat to make bread but not to make
biscuits). Thus, in order to get the supposed benefits of
&quot;hemp as fiber,&quot; you would also have to allow people to
use it as marijuana. But when we recall all of the harms
associated with marijuana use - medical problems, lost
productivity, increased accidents, increased crime, etc. - we
find that <i>even granting </i>the supposed benefits of
&quot;hemp as fiber,&quot; these benefits are still outweighed by
the negative consequences of such a policy. </p>

<p>Thus, the &quot;hemp as fiber&quot; argument is disproved by
both history and the fact that no other countries are seriously
considering it as an option. But even granting the legalizers
arguments here, the costs of such a policy still would clearly
outweigh the benefits. </p>

<p>154 For proof of this fact the reader is invited to scan any
Agriculture or Commerce reports from 1916 to 1937. </p>

<p>We should grow hemp and use it as fiber, thus achieving
environmental benefits. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then

<p>When farmers could do this in the early twentieth century in
the U.S., no one did. [Reports of the Departments of Agriculture
and Commerce, 1916-1937.] </p>

<p>If it is such a good idea, why aren't any other countries in
the world doing it now? </p>

<p>Even if we granted the supposed benefits of &quot;hemp as
fiber,&quot; (which we should not), the costs of such a program
would still clearly outweigh the benefits. <br>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p> <img src="blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> <b>Purpose</b> </p>

<p> The purpose of this manual is twofold: first, to analyze the
arguments employed by proponents of drug legalization or
decriminalization;1 and second, to provide arguments necessary to
defeat these positions. </p>

<p> <b>Structure</b> </p>

<p> This manual is divided into chapters, each chapter addressing
a different argument used by the &quot;legalizers.&quot; For
example, Chapter One addresses the argument that legalizing drugs
would reduce the addiction rate; Chapter Two addresses the impact
that legalizing drugs would have on the crime rate. Furthermore,
each chapter is divided into two parts. The first part, termed
the &quot;Discussion&quot; section, briefly states the
legalizers' arguments and then provides an in-depth analysis of
how to defeat them. </p>

<p> The second part of each chapter is termed the &quot;Summary
Sheet&quot; section. The Summary Sheet section is designed for
people who for whatever reason do not have time to read the
Discussion section - for example, those people who actually are
involved in a debate at that moment. The Summary Sheet section is
divided into two columns, the first titled &quot;If They
Say,&quot; and the second called &quot;Then You Say.&quot; The
Summary Sheet section basically iterates the factual highlights
of the Discussion section in a format that is easy to &quot;just
pick up and use.&quot; In both the Discussion and the Summary
Sheet sections, relevant facts will be footnoted or otherwise
cited. This is so that if anyone asks you where you got your
information, you will be able to tell them immediately. </p>

<p> Appendix One suggests a structured format for an actual
public debate. Following these rules will prevent the debate from
disintegrating into a shouting match and a forum for
&quot;speeches&quot; from the audience. </p>

<p> Finally, an extensive bibliography is provided for your
convenience should you choose to pursue additional reading. </p>

<p> 1 For purposes of this manual, &quot;legalization&quot; means
a policy whereby selling and using drugs is legal.
&quot;Decriminalization&quot; means a policy whereby penalties
for breaking the drug laws are lessened and/or the drug laws are
restricted in scope. See Ralph A. Weisheit and Katherine Johnson,
&quot;'Exploring the Dimensions of Support for Decriminalization
of Drugs,&quot; Journal of Drug Issues, Winter 1992. That is, if
heroin were legalized, it would be legal to sell or use it. If
heroin were decriminalized, it technically would be illegal to
use it, but (for instance) the penalty for its use would be a $10
fine. Another example of decriminalization would be allowing the
use of heroin as a common pain killer in hospitals. </p>

<h2>Introductory Pointers </h2>

<p> <img src="blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> Before getting to the substance of the legalization debate
itself, here are three suggestions for use when debating the
legalizers. </p>

<p> <b>1.</b> <b>Right to expect benefits. </b>As with any
policy, you have a right to demand that the legalizers prove that
the benefits of their proposal outweigh its costs. </p>

<p> <b>2.</b> <b>Right to specificity. </b>As with any policy,
you have a right to demand that the legalizers provide a specific
proposal which to debate. One cannot talk about policy in the
abstract. For example, let's say that you were debating whether
the federal government should cut spending - you have to have
some idea of what is to be cut, how much is to be cut, when it is
going to be cut, etc. With regard to the legalization debate, you
should ask your opponent these questions <i>at the beginning of
the debate:</i> </p>

<ul>
    <li>What drugs are we talking about? </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Are they advocating legalization or decriminalization? </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Are there limitations on who can use these drugs - what
        about children, pregnant women, prison inmates, police,
        members of the military, people who drive buses or fly
        planes, etc.? </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Are there limitations on the quantity or potency of drugs
        that the individual can use? Would an unlimited supply of
        drugs be made available to the habitual users or drug
        addicts? </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Who will create, market, and sell the drugs? </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>How much will the drugs cost? Will the drugs be taxed,
        and if so, at what rate? </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Will drug addiction be able to be used as a defense in
        civil or criminal trials? </li>
</ul>

<p> Make sure that your opponent answers these questions early!
After all, it is only fair that you know what you are debating
before you begin the debate. </p>

<p> <b>3. Right to sources of information. </b>You have a right
to ask the legalizers the source of their data. By the same
token, they have the right to ask the same of you (and that's why
this manual is complete with footnotes). </p>

<p> Bearing these pointers in mind, we begin with an analysis of
legalization and addiction rates. <br>

<h2>Chapter Eleven: &quot;Anything Is Better Than What We Are
Doing Now&quot; Hopelessness, Drug Control and Potential
Solutions </h2>

<p><img src="blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562" height="19">
</p>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>The final argument of the legalizers is one of hopelessness -
the status quo obviously is not working because we are spending
lots of money on the problem, and it is not yet solved.
Therefore, any policy is preferable to the present one. </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>Such cynicism is understandable - drugs are a pervasive
problem in our culture. But legalization is not the answer, and
in order to prove this we should look at two points: first, that
the problem is getting better, and second, that many other viable
solutions besides legalization exist. </p>

<p><b>1. The Problem is Getting Better</b> </p>

<p>A mere purview of the facts proves that our problems with
drugs are not as bad as they used to be. For example, in 1979 the
percentage of 12 to 17-yr. olds who said they had used any
illicit drug in the past month was 17.6%. In 1992, it was down to
6.1%. Similarly, the percentages for ages 18-25 yrs. dropped from
37. 1 % to 13.0%. 155 Cocaine use is also down. In 1982 the
percentage of 18-25 yr. olds reporting past month use of cocaine
was 6.8 %. In 1992 the figure had dropped to 1.8%.156
Unfortunately, the 1993 data show a bottoming out and reversal of
this trend, which has been linked to a softening attitude about
the dangers of drug use.157 </p>

<p>Not only is drug use down, but public opinion has crystallized
into a &quot;no drug tolerance&quot; position. One Gallup poll
reported that over 80% of Americans said legalizing drugs was a
bad idea.158 A large majority said they feared legalization would
lead to increases in addiction, drug overdoses, drug-related
crime and drug use in schools. 159 Furthermore, a study conducted
in 1990 showed </p>

<p>that 89% of the population would be willing to pay higher
taxes to support the War on Drugs. 160 And as discussed above,
children and adolescents have become less tolerant of drug use.
As a letter to the New York Times on May 7, 1988, written by a
class of 14 and 15 yr. olds explained, &quot;America is in a
'moral rut' and ... drug abuse is one of the main
causes.&quot;161 </p>

<p>Thus, not only is drug use declining, but public opinion grows
increasingly hostile to any such behavior. No wonder so few
people favor legalization these days. </p>

<p><b>2. Alternative Solutions</b> </p>

<p>These facts are not to suggest, however, that we should become
complacent in our efforts. Drug use continues to be a severe
social problem, and we should always be on the lookout for
innovative policies. Here are just a few ideas. </p>

<p>First, we should continue our reliance on strong legal
sanctions to deter drug use. That is, keeping drugs illegal does
decrease their use. As one commentator noted, 70% of high school
students in New Jersey and 60% of those in California said that
fear of getting in trouble with the law was a </p>

<p>primary reason not to use drugs.162 Not only do legal
sanctions keep people from trying drugs in </p>

<p>the first instance, but they also help to get people off them
later. A study conducted by Douglas </p>

<p>Anglin of UCLA noted that the potential success rate of
treatment programs depends largely on how long the patient
remains with the program. The longer you stay, the better your
chances of </p>

<p>recovery. And Anglin also found that people who enter
treatment under legal compulsion (i.e., a court order) stay in
the program longer.163 </p>

<p>Thus, legal sanctions eventually correlate to treatment
success rate. </p>

<p>Second, we should continue to decrease social tolerance for
drug use at all levels of society and at all levels of drug use.
As former DEA Administrator Jack Lawn said, &quot;Here's what it
means in shirt sleeve English. [The] public is telling the drug
user, 'What you're doing is not just your business. It's criminal
and it's unacceptable. Get help and get treatment if you need it,
or face the consequences. We don't want to be hard-hearted, but
this problem exists only because you and people like you keep it
alive. The rest of us don't want to put up with it
anymore'&quot;. 164 </p>

<p>Third, we should use education to encourage people not to use
drugs. Educating the youth is one of society's most important
responsibilities, and nowhere is the need for education greater
than to teach children about the dangers of drug use.165 Such
policies are working with regard to smoking, for as Kurt Schmoke
admits, &quot;[t]he number of people smoking continues to fall
because of a concerted public education campaign about the health
effects of smoking.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>Fourth, we should encourage private enterprise to adopt
workplace rules restricting drug use. By implementing policies
such as drug testing, businesses can greatly reduce drug use
while at the same time increasing their productivity. For
example, Hoffman Construction of Portland, Oregon, implemented
drug policies and decreased workers' compensation claims by 17%.
Indeed, by year three, Hoffman had reduced its workers'
compensation costs by almost 90%.167 Perhaps the<i> </i>government
could use tax credits to encourage businesses to promote drug
policies. </p>

<p>Fifth, it is possible that the growing health-consciousness in
the United States today (favoring more exercise, less
cholesterol, less alcohol and smoking, etc.) will go a long way
in and of itself to decrease drug use.168 </p>

<p>Finally, we may be able to turn to science for help. Some
scholars are proposing the use of biotechnology to eradicate drug
crops while at the same time planting more socially useful plants
(wheat, soybeans, corn, etc.). 169 </p>

<p>In the final analysis of the legalization debate we must
remember that drug abuse is a long-term </p>

<p>problem: it took China over fifty years to kick its opium
addiction.170 And granted, drug use still </p>

<p>takes far too large a toll on the United States. But when we
consider the decreasing tolerance for, and use of, drugs in our
country, as well as the numerous alternatives we are pursuing and
have yet to pursue, it seems clear that legalization of drugs is
not the answer. </p>

What We Are Doing Now&quot;, Hopelessness, Drug Control, and
Potential Solutions </h2>

</p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>If
they say...</b> </p>

<p>Any policy is better than the status quo. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then
you</b> <b>say...</b> </p>

<p>Drug use has been declining: in 1979 the percentage of 12 to
17-yr. olds who said they had used any illicit drug in the past
month was 17.6%. In 1992, it was down to 6.1%. Similarly, for
ages 1825 yrs. use dropped from 37. 1 % to 13.0%. In 1982 the
percentage of 18-25 yr. olds reporting past month use of cocaine
was 6.8%. In 1992 the figure had dropped to 1.8%. [Preliminary
Estimates from the 1992 National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse,&quot; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, June
1993]. </p>

<p>Public tolerance for drug use is declining. One Gallup poll
reported that over 80% of Americans said legalizing drugs was a
bad idea- A large majority said they feared legalization would
lead to increases in addiction, drug overdoses, drug-related
crime and drug use in schools. [David Zucchino, &quot;A Push to<b>
</b>Make Drugs Illegal,&quot; Philadelphia Inquirer, July 5,
1992]. In fact, 89% of the public would be willing to<b> </b>pay
higher taxes to support the War on Drugs. [Ralph A. Weisheit and
Kathrine Johnson, &quot;Exploring the Dimensions of Support for
Decriminalizing Drugs,&quot; Journal of Drug Issues, Winter
1992]. </p>

<p>Other solutions besides legalization exist: </p>

<p>We should continue to employ legal sanctions against drug
users for two reasons. First, studies of high school students
suggest that between 60% and 70% cite not wanting to get in
trouble with the law as a reason not to use drugs in the first
place. [Robert E. Peterson, &quot;Stop Legalization of Illegal
Drugs,&quot; Drug Awareness Information Newsletter, July 1988].
Second, the use of legal sanction is a good means of keeping
addicts in treatment programs for longer periods of time, thus
increasing the probability of successful treatment [James Q.
Wilson, &quot;Against the Legalization of Drugs,&quot;
Commentary, February 1990]. </p>

<p>We should continue to decrease social tolerance for any and
all drug use at any and all levels of society. </p>

<p>We should promote drug awareness education as a means o
deterring use, as is presently being done successfully with
regard to tobacco use. </p>

<p>We should use tax incentives to encourage businesses to adopt
drug policies such as those of a Portland, Oregon business that
decreased its workers' compensation claims 90% in three years.
[&quot;Position Paper In Opposition To The Legalization of
Drugs,&quot; Regional Drug Initiative Task Force, September
1990.] </p>

<p>The general health-consciousness sweeping the country may go a
long way to decreasing casual drug use. [Ralph A. Weisheit and
Kathrine Johnson, &quot;Exploring the Dimensions of Support for
Decriminalizing Drugs,&quot; Journal of Drug Issues, Winter
1992]. </p>

<p>We should research ways in which biotechnology could be used
to eradicate drug crops and replace them with socially useful
growth such as wheat or corn. [Gabriel Nahas, &quot;A Battle Won,
A Stalemated War, and A New Strategy,&quot; Position Paper]. </p>

<p>We should remember that drug use is a long-term problem that
will take a long time to solve: it took China 50 years to kick
its opium addiction. [Gabriel Nahas, &quot;The Decline of Drugged
Nations,&quot; Wall Street Journal, July 11, 1988]. <br>

<p><font size="3">The graph presents lifetime usage rates
(&quot;Have you used substance 'x' at anytime in your

of clear and regularly updated national usage estimates before
1972 calls into question the extent to which policy-makers were
(are) accurately informed about usage patterns and their
relationships to existing laws and other societal trends. We can
see, for example, that cocaine use has no reliable estimates
uncovered thus far prior to the initiation of NIDA's annual
household surveys around 1972, and reliable cannabis use
estimates are hard to find prior to 1969. Difficulties with the
parochial reporting procedures of alcohol (gallons
produced/consumed per capita) and tobacco (cigarettes
manufactured/sold/consumed per capita) in many references also
make it difficult to establish continual use patterns prior to
1972. It is difficult to imagine making national policy decisions
without such reliable national usage estimates.</font></p>

<PRE>SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT:

     The trial court found that Rev. Brown could not submit evidence as to 
his religious establishment and exericse, to the jury.  The court based 
it's decision on the Fifth Circuit's decision in 1967, in Leary v. U.S., 
383 F.2d 851.  In doing so, the court ignored all the precedent to 
compelling interest and least restrictive means developed since Reynolds 
v. U.S., 98 U.S. 244 in 1878.  Even more significant of it's prejudice, 
the court refused to recognize the established precedent of the Eighth 
Circuit in Warner v. Graham, 675 F.Supp. 1177, in 1987 and a half dozen 
decisions reached under the Religous Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 
including the Eighth Circuit decision in Rust v. Clarke, 851 F.Supp. 377 
in 1994.
     The trial court summarily dismissed all defenses advanced by Rev. 
Brown regarding Natural Law, Common Law, the Declaration of Independence, 
the U.S. Constitution, Necessity, and the lack of Federal powers under the 
Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution, without allowing any showing 
of evidense, testimony, or argument.  In doing so it abused its discretion 
and deprived Rev. Brown of even a shadow of a fair trial under DUE 
PROCESS.
     The trial court threatened Rev. Brown's assisting attornney in a 
letter dated October 25, 1994.  The court refused to hold a hearing on a 
motion for clarification of attorneys duties ex parte which is required as 
this is a matter of attorney client privelege.  The trial court created 
rules for standby counsel which substantially deprived Rev. Brown of the 
assistance of counsel.  This constitutes an abuse of discretion on the 
part of the trial court.
     The trial court refused to question two jurors who were overheard 
discussing the case and making disparaging remarks about the defendant on 
a break the second day of trial.  The trial court refused to substitute 
the extra jurrors for these two prejudiced jurors and substantially 
deprived Rev. Brown of Due Process.
     For all these reasons, Rev. Brown has been deprived of his 
constitutional rights and has been deprived of Due Process.  For these 
reasons the conviction of Rev. Brown must be set aside and appropriate 
relief granted to him.

<PRE>STATEMENT OF THE CASE

     In 1988, four residents of northwest Arkansas founded Our Church.  
They sent out letters to friends and neighbors they thought would want to 
be a part of Our Church.  The letters were unsigned. (Exhibit A 1,2).  
Rev. Tom Brown recieved these letters.  He immediately made photocopys of 
the letters - as instructed - and passed them to others who he thought 
would be interested.  The first person he took them to turned out to be 
one of the origional writers of the letters.  That person expressed 
interest, denied any knowlege of Our Church, and asked to be kept 
informed.  Rev. Brown heard rumors of someone trying to get permission 
from the local Unitarian Church to hold services there, but no more after 
that.
     In January of 1994, about the 10th, Rev. Brown awoke from a dream to 
a feeling of overwelming peace and expectation of great good fortune.  It 
was an unprecedented experience.  He felt like he had been touched by the 
hand of God.  He did not remember any details of the dream, just the 
extraordinary feeling upon awakening.  He located the letters several 
day's later while organizing his file cabinet.  He realized that Our 
Church was what the dream had been about.  It was time to stand up and 
start practicing his relationship with God openly, the way God intended.
     Rev. Brown owns a forty acre parcel of Ozark mountain property known 
as South Slope Farm.  He deeded one acre of that land to Our Church on 
February 14, 1994; the day we dedicate to Love, Valentines Day. (Exhibit B 
1,2).  He contacted all his friends and asked who would like to start Our 
Church with him - including the origional founders whom he still had not 
identified.  They all said they knew the Truth of Our Church, but were 
afraid of the persecution which Rev. Brown has come to know so well.  They 
refused to join openly, but each in their own way contributed something to 
getting Our Church organized.  Then he went to strangers and finally eight 
other folks signed the papers to start Our Church Incorporated, as a 
non-profit, religous corporation in the State of Arkansas. (Exhibit C 
1,2,3,4,5).  Although it is not required in the State of Arkansas they all 
agreed to a Statement of Purpose (C-5) which can not be changed except by 
unanimous agreement of all official members.
     The Deed to the acre of land owned by Our Church at Antioch Arkansas, 
is restricted by covenants as to the use of the land. (A-2)  Our Church 
Inc. is not so encumbered.  Each of the origional incorporators sought to 
establish their own branch of Our Church at their home location; or in the 
case of the Family Church of the New Dawn, preceeded the establishment of 
Our Church.  FCND was founded in 1982 in Fayetteville, Arkansas.  Official 
membership in Our Church is established by a notorized statement submitted 
to the CEO of the Corporation, signifying intention to join Our Church 
Inc. and abide by the Statement of Purpose.  The purpose of Official 
membership is to become a public, open and living example of Our Church, 
so our Brothers and Sisters in God can take heart and begin to openly live 
their lives in keeping with their knowledge of the God of their own 
understanding and their Higher Power.
     On March 29, 1994, members of Our Church Inc. met with Washington 
County Sheriff Kenneth McKee and other law enforcement officials in 
Fayetteville, Arkansas.  They discussed the plans of Our Church at Antioch 
to plant and distribute herbs and plants given to us by God for our 
Spiritual discernment and Physical nourishment.
     On Easter Sunday, April 3, 1994, Our Church at Antioch, held it's 
first service and consecration of land. 
     On August 2, 1994, Rev. Brown was accosted by DEA agents and 
Sheriff's deputies while tending the garden at Our Church at Antioch.  
They attempted to murder him, and when that failed, they stole four 
hundred and thirty five marijuana plants and three peyote plants that were 
growing there.
     July 31, was the last regular service at Our Church at Antioch.  
Since then services for Washington County, Arkansas residents have been 
held at the Family Church of the New Dawn, 1027 Hickery St., Fayetteville, 
Arkansas.  Each member church of Our Church Inc. is financially and 
theologically independent of Our Church Inc.; founded and organized by the 
membership of that church.  This is a congregational organization similar 
to the Southern Baptist Convention.  Other branchs of Our Church are 
operating in Mt. Shasta, California; Boulder, Colorado; Oklahoma City, 
Oklahoma; Bee Branch, Atkins and Little Rock, Arkansas.
     On August 11, 1994, Rev. Brown was arrested and charged with growing 
marijuana and peyote, and possession of marijuana with intent to 
distribute in violation of Federal Law.  Rev. Brown insisted on the right 
to control his own case, and to not give over representation to an 
attorney, and requested the assistance of counsel.  Two seperate attorneys 
were appointed who refused to research or help Rev. Brown to research the 
law, to prepare motions, question witness's, etc. and were discharged by 
the court.  The third attorney recieved a threatening letter from the 
judge and sought to withdraw.  The judge appointed her as standby counsel 
and ordered her to not do the defendant's bidding.
     Rev. Brown attempted to testify to the Grand Jury and spent two days 
waiting while it met, but was refused.  An indictment was returned on 
September 14, 1994.  On November 4, 1994, Rev. Brown filed a motion to 
recuse the Judge based on Arkansas State Police documents which show Judge 
Waters to have been involved in a criminal conspiracy to smuggle drugs and 
move women around the country for purposes of prostitution in the 1970's 
prior to his appointment to the bench.  Judge Waters denied the motion.
     On November 8, 1994, the government filed a motion in limine which 
sought to deprive the defendant of all his defenses.  On November 28, 
1994, a hearing was held which resulted in Judge Waters finding that Our 
Church was a sincere establishment and exercise of religion, and that Rev. 
Brown's acts of growing marijuana and peyote were acts affected by the 
Religous Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, and that the government had a 
compelling interest in prohibiting that act because Congress had passed a 
law with severe criminal penalties for violating the law.  Rev. Brown 
attempted to introduce documents and witnesses to show that the attitude 
of law enforcement had changed since the passage of the law, and that 
there had been a change in the scientific knowledge also, but Judge waters 
refused to review or entertain any such evidense or witnesses.  Rev. Brown 
properly protested.  Rev. Brown would have shown that there was no Federal 
Jurisdiction under the Commerce Clause for prosecuting Our Church of 
Antioch, Arkansas, and Rev. Tom Brown, but Judge Waters refused to allow 
any presentation of any issue except as to the question of the sincerely 
of Rev.  Brown's religous exercise.  Rev. Brown had attempted to obtain 
subpeona's for witnesses to the hearing, Judge Waters granted the 
subpoenas but then issued them for the wrong date, so the witnesses could 
not show up for the hearing.  Rev. Brown protested but Judge Waters 
refused to allow any correction to be made.  Rev. Brown attempted to 
introduce evidence and witnesses that Rev. Brown's acts were necessary to 
prevent a greater evil, a necessity defense, but Judge Waters refused to 
allow any such introduction into the record, or to allow the use of that 
defense.
     On October 25, 1994, Judge Waters wrote a letter to advising attorney 
Leslie Borgogoni in which he threatned to not reimburse her for expenses 
of the defense of Rev. Brown.  In response, she filed a motion for 
clarification of duties.  At the hearing on that motion, Rev. Brown 
protested the fact that it was not conducted ex parte.  His motion was 
overruled.  Borgogoni attempted to withdraw as advising counsel but Waters 
made her standby counsel instead.  He wrote a set of rules for her which 
specifically directed her to not perform any task at the direction of Rev. 
Brown until and unless he gave up his pro per status.
     On November 19, 1994, a criminal trial was held.  Rev. Brown was 
repeatedly stopped from presenting evidense and testimony in his defense.  
Judge Waters repeatedly interupted Rev. Brown and made disparaging remarks 
about him and his attempt to defend himself.  Although Waters had admitted 
that Rev. Brown was engaged in a sincere exercise of his religion, Rev. 
Brown was denied the right to present evidence of his religion, the 
Constitution, Natural Law, Common Law, and government documents related to 
the issues of compelling interest and least restrictive means.  On 
November 30, 1994, Rev. Brown was convicted and incarcerated without bail 
in the County Jail.
     Rev. Brown immediately attempted to get access to a law library in 
order to prepare motions for new trial, etc., but was denied that access 
until January 28, 1995.  By this time the time limit on motions had 
passed, and Waters overruled all motions on that basis.
     Rev. Brown has been denied a fair trial, due process in keeping with 
the published precedent of the Eighth Circuit, and the protection of the 
Constitution and the Religous Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.  The 
prosecution of Rev. Brown for growing plants given to us by God, and 
giving away the leaves and flowers of those plants for free, no cost, no 
exchange, no renumeration whatsoever; exceeds Congressional powers granted 
by the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.  In addition, Rev. 
Brown was unconstitutionally denied the assistance of counsel.  For all 
these reasons the conviction of Rev. Brown must be set aside and 
appropriate relief granted.
     In closing, Rev. Brown notes that he has been forced to prepare this 
brief without the assistance of counsel, and he requests that a liberal 
construction and interpretation be given to this document.

<PRE>STATEMENT OF INTRODUCTION

     The Defendent / Appellant, Rev. Tom Brown Pro Per, seeks to introduce 
this appeal by casting the eye of the Court on some issues that should be 
kept in mind as the Court considers the case at hand.  This case is only 
one in a long series of battles of the vaunted War on Drugs.  As in any 
war, looking back over the past thirty years, we can see lots of 
casualties.  The question is, how many more bodies will be heaped on the 
Alter of National Paranoia ?  A wise man once said that those who refuse 
to learn from history, are doomed to repeat it.  Perhaps the Court could 
look at another war we waged on ourselves, another war bred in ignorance 
and fed on lies and corruption.
     In Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. at page 700, Justice Taney 
announces the decision of the Court saying:

        "The question before us, is whether the class of persons
   described in the plea of abatement compose a portion of this
   people and are constituent members of this sovereignty.  We
   think they are not, and that they are not included under the
   word citizen in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none
   of the rights and priveleges which that instrument provides
   for and secures to citizens of the United States.  On the con-
   trary, they were at that time considered as a subordinate and
   inferior class of beings, who had been subjugated by the dom-
   inant race, and whether emancipated or not, yet remained sub-
   ject to their authority, and had no rights or priveleges but
   such as those who held power and the government might grant
   them.
        It is not the providence of the Court to decide upon the
   justice or injustice, the policy or the impolicy of these laws.
   The decision of that question belonged to the political or
   law making power; to those who formed the sovereignty and
   framed the Constitution.
        The language of the Declaration of independence is equa-
   lly conclusive.  It proceeds to say; 'We hold these truths to
   be self evident; that all men are created equal; that they are
   endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that
   among them is life, liberty, and the persuit of happiness;
   that to secure these rights, governments are instituted, deri-
   ving their just powers from the consent of the governed.'...
        The general words above quoted would seem to embrace the
   whole human family, and if they were used in a similar instru-
   ment at this day, would so be understood.  But it is too clear
   for dispute, that the enslaved African race were not intended
   to be included, and formed no part of the people who framed
   and adopted this declaration; . . ."

     The Court will see these words again in the decisions which have 
refused to recognize the religous use of plants.  Not all courts have 
refused to recognize over 5,000 years of recorded human history, but the 
words of those who have are redolent with the scent of the Dred Scott 
decision, and the bodies of those who perished in the attempt to make up 
for the cowardice of the Dred Scott court.  Time after time those courts 
strain to justify the denial of rights which no man can claim did not 
exist and were not exercised among the peoples who wrote the Declaration 
and the Constitution.  And as Justice McLean's dissent shows below, 
despicable and vile acts perpetrated by men who happen to occupy positions 
of power are not unprecedented.  There was no Truth to the assertion that 
"no one thought of disputing" the issue of slavery at the time of the 
revolution.  There was no Truth to the statement that "they formed no part 
of the people who framed and adopted this Declaration."  In fact:

        "Crispus Attucks, a Negro, was the first man killed by
   the British in the Boston Massacre.  The five thousand Negro
   soldiers who fought in the revolution . . .  Three quarters of
   the Rhode Island Regiment passing in review at Yorktown in
   1781 were Negroes. (Afro-American Encyclopedia, 1974)

But this truth was known in 1856 as we see in Justice McLean's dissent:

        "In the Convention, it was proposed by a committee of
   eleven to limit the importation of slaves to the year 1800,
   when Mr. Pickney moved to extend the time to the year 1808.
   This motion carried . . .  In Opposition to the motion, Mr.
   Madison said; 'Twenty years will produce all the mischief
   that can be apprehended from the liberty to import slaves;
   so long a term will be more dishonerable to the American
   character than to say nothing about it in the Constitution'
   Madison Papers.
        But we know as a historical fact that James Madison, that
   great and good man, a leading member in the Federal Convention,
   was solicitous to guard the language of that instrument so as
   not to convey the idea there could be property in Man."

     So the lies and deceit of the Taney majority went on to result in a 
war of unprecedented proportion on this soil.  More died in it than in 
WWI, WWII, Korea, and Vietnam combined.  And we paid a hard price for that 
clever though despicable interpretation of History and precedent.  The 
question is posed here, what price will this Court chose to be paid.  The 
Rev. Brown comes to this Court as a Man of Honor, with empty hands and 
outstretched arms.  Rev. Brown comes before this Court as the result of an 
act of conscience, inspired by the Holy Spirit of God.  The Court is 
refered to the words of James Michner, in his book Covenent.  As we 
listen, a young African is asking an old adviser as to the choice of 
weapons he should carry;

        "How do I protect myself ?"
        "Integrity is a good shield.  He paused.  Did I ever come
   armed to your fathers krall ?  Couldn't he have killed me in a
   moment if he wished?  Why didn't he?  Because he knew that if he
   killed a Man of Honor, he'd soon have on his hands, men with
   none.  And then the whole thing falls apart. (pg. 91)

     Later in the book, another character is remembering her brother who 
became a spy and sold the secrets of the government.

        "When she tried to decipher how he had been seduced into
   committing his mortal sin - the betrayal of his nation and his
   peers - she began to think of the role words play in life.  Our
   family was keen on word games.  Wexton and I played them const-
   antly.  I think I first came to suspect him when he cheated one
   day.  Altered the meaning of a word in order to win.  At Cambridge
   he altered the meanings of great words and ended a traitor.
   Back in Salisbury, walking within the shadow of the Cathedral,
   she thought: Integrity in words protects integrity in life.
   If a word is corrupted, everything that stems from it will be
   evil."

     And so it is that we have evil in our own time, and in our own place. 
A creeping, seductive evil that knows every nook and cranny of the 
administrative, legislative and judicial branch of government.  And it is 
born in a series of little lies, lies told, lies repeated, and lies which 
become the bricks of the foundation of our life.  And the question is, 
will this Court end the lies.
     There are already over ten million marajuana felons in our nation.  
We outnumber all the judges, prosecutors, police, drug bureaucrats, and 
military by about two to one.  How much longer will thirty perceent of our 
population be treated as a "subordinate and inferior class of beings . . . 
(who) had no rights or priveleges but such as those who held power and the 
government might grant them."  How much longer will we be expected to 
suffer in peace while the abuses of our rights continue unabated?  How 
much longer will the courts decide questions of the burdening of religous 
establishment and exercise one way for the Roman Catholic Church, and 
another for Our Church ?  Is it too soon to address the question, is the 
issue not ripe enough ?  You can dam the river, but you can't stop the 
rain.  Please, for God's sake and our own, stop the lies and live in the 
truth !

<p><font size="3">This graph details lifetime use of five classes
of substances between 1971 and 1990 among American adults. At no
time has use of any single class of substances presented exceeded
20% of the U.S. population. The most hated and feared substance
class of them all, the opiates, has never claimed more than 5% of
the population as adherents. Even in 1910, the percentage of
American adults using opiates was 0.2%; that is, two-tenths of 1%
(Brecher et al., 1972, p. 62). Not presented are usage rates for
caffeine, which is due to the lack of reliable information about
its longitudinal use among Americans (even NIDA neglects to track
caffeine's use in its &quot;National Surveys&quot;).</font></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Chapter 7 </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>The Pure -Food and Drug Act of 1906</strong></font><br>
</p>

<p>A major step forward in the control of opiate addiction was
taken in 1906 </p>

<p>when Congress passed the first Pure Food and Drug Act despite
opposition </p>

<p>from the patent-medicine interests. The pressures to pass the
act were </p>

<p>intense-generated by Dr. Harvey W. Wiley and his crusading
journalistic </p>

<p>followers, notably Samuel Hopkins Adams,' who were known as
&quot;muckrakers.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>The 1906 act required that medicines containing opiates and
certain other </p>

<p>drugs must say so on their labels.2 Later amendments to the
act also </p>

<p>required that the quantity of each drug be truly stated on the
label, and </p>

<p>that the drugs meet official standards of identity and purity.
Thus, for a </p>

<p>time the act actually served to safeguard addicts.<br>
</p>

<p>The efforts leading to the 1906 act, the act itself and
subsequent </p>

<p>amendments, and educational campaigns urging families not to
use patent </p>

<p>medicines containing opiates, no doubt helped curb the making
of new </p>

<p>addicts. Indeed, there is evidence of a modest decline in
opiate addiction </p>

<p>from the peak in the 1890s until 1914.3<br>
</p>

<p>For those already addicted, however, the protection afforded
by the 1906 </p>

<p>act and by subsequent amendments was short-lived, for in 1914
Congress </p>

<p>passed the Harrison Narcotic Act, which cut off altogether the
supply of </p>

<p>legal opiates to addicts. As a result, the door was opened
wide to </p>

<p>adulterated, contaminated, and misbranded black-market
narcotics of all </p>

<p>kinds. The heroin available on the street in the United States
today, for </p>

<p>example, is a highly dangerous mixture of small amounts of
heroin with </p>

<p>large and varying amounts of adulterants. The black market
similarly </p>

<p>distributes today large quantities of adulterated,
contaminated, and </p>

<p>misbranded LSD and other drugs. The withdrawal of the
protection of the </p>

<p>food-and-drug laws from the users of illicit drugs, as we
shall show, has </p>

<p>been one of the sign)ficant factors in reducing addicts to
their present </p>

<p>miserable status, and in making drug use so damaging today. </p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Chapter 6</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Opium smoking is outlawed</strong></font></p>

<p>To summarize the data reviewed so far, opiates taken daily in
large doses by addicts were not a social menace under
nineteenth-century conditions, and were not perceived as a
menace. Opium, morphine, and heroin could be legally purchased
without a prescription, and there was little demand for opiate
prohibition. But there was one exception to this general
tolerance of the opiates. In 1875, the City of San Francisco
adopted an ordinance prohibiting the smoking of opium in
smoldng-houses or &quot;dens.&quot; 1</p>

<p>The roots of this ordinance were racist rather than
health-oriented, and were concerned with what today is known as
'1ife-style.&quot; Opium smoking was introduced into the United
States by tens of thousands of Chinese men and boys imported
during the l850s and 1880s to build the great Western railroads.*
The Chinese laborers then drifted into San Francisco and other
cities, and accepted employment of various kinds at low wages
-giving rise to waves of anti-Chinese hostility. Soon white men
and even women were smoking opium side by side with the Chinese,
a life-style which was widely disapproved. The San Francisco
authorities, we are told learned upon investigation that
&quot;many women and young girls, as well as young men of
respectable family, were being induced to visit the [Chinese]
opium-smoking dens, where they were ruined morally and otherwise
* The 1875 ordinance followed, &quot;forbidding the practice
under penalty of a heavy fine or imprisonment or both. Many
arrests were made, and the punishment was prompt and thorough.- 6</p>

<hr>

<p>* Professor Jonathan Spence of the Department of History, Yale
University, presented a fascinating account of opium smoking in
nineteenth-contury China at the Conforence on Local Control and
Social Protest during the Ch'ing Period, hold at Honolulu,
Hawaii, from June 27 to July a, 1971. He reported, for example,
that &quot;opium was highly regarded in China, both as a
medicinal drug (that checked diarrhea and sorved as a febrifuge),
and as an aphrodisiac. Therefore people might become addicted
eithor becawe they took opium intensively during an illness hr
instanco in the great cholera epidemic of 1821-or bocause they
had vigor, leisure and money and wanted to make the best of it.</p>

<p>'Those who who ate regularly and well did not suffer
physiologically from their addiction, but for the poor, addiction
was a serious health hazard (even though, ironically, it was
often first taken for health reasons), since scarce cash
resources were put to opium rather than food purchases. The
rewards for the poor were a blurring of the pains of prolonged
labor, and an increase in work capacity over short periods of
time. Then there was heavy addiction among coolies and
chair-bearers, and among such groups as boatmen who had to work
their boats upstream, and stone-cutters working out-of-doors in
cold weather. The last Chinese to become addicted seem to have
been the peasants, though as they grew moro opium crops the
incidenceof heavy opium anoking rose, and by 1902 one could find
entire rural communities that were in desperate straits because
addiction had become almost total. By the late Ch'ing, it scans
that no major occupational group was without its addicts.&quot;5 </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>~* One white girl of good family and education began opium
smoking at sixteen in San Francisco in 1880, later became a
prostitute, moved to Victoria, British Columbia, and was found in
an opium den in 1884 by a Royal Comnmission. The transcript of
her answers to questions reads, in part:</p>

<p>Q. Why did you commence to smoke opium?</p>

<p>A. Why do people commence to drink? Trouble, I suppose led me
to smoke. I think it is better than drink. People who smoke opium
do not kick up rows; they injure no one but themselves, and I do
not thinlc they injure themselves very much.</p>

<p>Q.... Why do you smoke now?</p>

<p>A. Bocause I must; I oould not live without it. I smoke partly
because of the quiet enjoyment it gives, but mainly to escape
from the horrors which would ensue if I not smoke. To be
twenty-four hours without smoking is to suffer worse tortures
than the lost.</p>

<p>Q. But does not the smoking make you wretched, past as
drinking would?</p>

<p>A. No; I require about twelve pipes, then I fall into a state
of somnolence and complete rest. When I awake I feel all right,
and can attend to fixing-up the house. I am brisk, and can work
as well as anybody else. I do not feel sick or nervous, neither
have I the inclination to smoke more opium.</p>

<p>O. Then why do you return to the use of the drug?</p>

<p>A. Ah! that's it; there is a time when my hands fail me; tears
fall from my eyes, I am ready to sink; then I come here and for a
few bits have a smoke which sets me right. There is too much
nonsense talked about opium-smoking. Life without it would be
unendurable, I am in excellent health; but, I suppose, every one
has their own troubles, and I have mine.</p>

<p>Q. I do not want to be offensive, but are you what is called a
fast woman?</p>

<p>A. I am. But you would be greatly mistaken if you inagined
that all the women wbo oome here to smoke are of that character.
In San Francisco I have known some of the first people visit
opium houses, and many respectable people do the same here.</p>

<p>Q. Are women of your class generaIly addicted to
opium-smoking? </p>

<p>A. No; they are more addicted to drink, and drink does them
far more harm. Drink excites passions, whereas this allays it;
and when a fast woman drinks she goes to min pretty quick....</p>

<p>Q. Have you anything else to add . . . ?</p>

<p>A. No; I would say this, though: that if opium houses were
licensed as drinking saloons are one need not have to come into
such holes as this to smoke. There would be nice rooms with nice
couches, and the degradation would be mitigated. At all events I
think the government that will not license an opium saloon should
shut up public houses and hotels where they sell vitriol for
wbiskey and brandy, and where men idle themselves with a
certainty and a rapidity beyond the power of opium.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>This first law, however, like so many subsequent antinarcotics
laws, failed to worlc despite the promptness and thoroughness of
the punishment. When opium dens became illegal, &quot;The vice
was indulged in much less openly, but none the less extensively,
for although the larger smoking-houses were closed, the small
dens in Cbinatown were well patronized, and the vice grew surely
and steadily.&quot;. Indeed, the new law &quot;seemed to add zest
to their enjoyment.&quot; 7 A similar ordinance was passed in
Virginia City, Nevada, the following year.8 This also failed to
accomplish its purpose; hence the State of Nevada passed a more
stringent act a year or two later.6 Other states and cities voted
similar statutes soon after.</p>

<p>==================================================================
</p>

<p>When these laws failed as well, Congress took a hand. Before
opium can be smoked, it must be specially prepared; and weak
opium containing less than the usual amount of morphine is used
in its preparation. In 1883, Congress raised the tariff on opium
prepared for smoking from $6 to $10 a pound; ' and in 1887 it
prohibited altogether the importation of the kind of weak
opium-that containing less than 9 percent morphine- used for
preparing smoking opium. The 1887 law also prohibited the
importation of opium by Chinese, and a law three years later
limited the manufacture of smoking opium to American citizens.11</p>

<p>The results of these steps were set forth in a letter dated
January 12, 1888, from the Secretary of the Treasury of the
United States to the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The
effect, he wrote, had been &quot;to stimulate smuggling,
extensively practiced by systematic organizations [presumably the
Chinese &quot;tongs&quot; or mutual benefit societies on the
Pacific coast. Recently completed facilities for transcontinental
transportation have enabled the opium smugglers to extend their
illicit traffic to our Northern border. Although all possible
efforts have been made by this Department to suppress the
traffic, it is found practically impossible to do so.&quot; 12</p>

<p>The law was not changed, however; indeed, the tariff on
smoking opium was further increased, from $10 to $12 per pound in
1890. Then, in 1897, it was reduced to $6 a pound
&quot;experience having at last taught that it could not bear a
higher rate without begetting an extensive surreptitious
manufacture or serious smuggling operations.&quot; Following the
reduction in the tariff, &quot;the amount that passed through the
customs houses . . . progressively increased.&quot; 13</p>

<p>Throughout this period, states and cities continued to pass
laws against opium smoking;* by 1914 there were twenty-seven such
laws in effect.. Yet the amount of smoking opium legally imported
continued to rise steadily, as shown in Table 2. 14 </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>*Several of these laws also made it a crime to possess a pipe
for the smoking of opium precedent for later laws prohibiting the
possession of hypodermic needles and syringes without a
prescription. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>There was a lesson implicit in these import figures. During
more than thirty years of city, state, and federal efforts to
suppress opium smoking, the amount smoked per year increased
sevenfold-without taking account of smuggled supplies.</p>

<p>In 1909, the importation of smoking opium was prohibited
altogether.l5 This law was successful in the sense that smoking
opium imported through the customhouses fell to zero, but it did
not solve the opium-smoking problem. Congress in January 1914
found it necessary to amend the 1909 law 16 and to pass an
additional statute imposing a prohibitive tax ($300 per pound) on
opium prepared for smoking within the United States.7 In December
1914 Congress passed the Harrison Narcotic Act, with far broader
provisional~ </p>

<p>(see Chapter 8). Yet as late as 1930, according to Federal
Narcotics Commissioner Harry J. Anslinger and United States
Attorney William F. Tompkins, &quot;opium dens could be found in
almost any American city.&quot; 19<br>

<p>l </p>

<p>One reason for the failure of these anti-opium-smoking laws,
and of subsequent anti narcotics laws, appears obvious. They were
aimed at private transactions between willing sellers and
willing, usually eager, buyers Thus there were no complainants.
Other such laws include the Volstead Act, since repealed, which
prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages; the laws against
fornication, homosexual acts, and other sexual acts between
consenting individuals in private; the laws against gambling; and
the drug laws generally. The phrase &quot;crimes without
victims&quot; has been applied to such acts; they can more
accurately be called &quot;crimes without complainants.&quot; It
is hard to cite a law aimed at crimes of this class which has had
much effect in curbing the behavior aimed at..* </p>

<hr>

<p>* -all laws which can be violated without doing any one an
injury are laughed at. Nay, so far are they from doing anything
to control the desires and passions o men that, on the
contrary, they direct and incite men's thoughts the rnore toward
those wry objects; for we always strive toward what is forbidden
and desire the things we are not allowed to have. And men of
leisure are never deficient in the ingenuity needed to enable
them to outwit laws framed to regulate things which cannot be
entirely forbidden.... He who tries to detennine everything by
law will foment clime rather than lessen it.&quot;-Baruch Spinoza
(1632-1677).20</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mere fact that a law fails to achieve its goal fully is of
course not a sufficient reason for repealing it; witness the laws
against murder. The basic argument against laws creating crimes
without complainants must rest on evidence that they not only
fail but also, in the process of failing, do more harm than good.
Such evidence exists with respect to the laws against opium
smoking. For one effect of these laws was to convert opium
smokers to more hazardous forms of opiate use.</p>

<p>&quot;Opium smoking is vastly less vicious than
morphine-taking,&quot; wrote an American authority on opiates,
Dr. Charles B. Towns, in 1912.21 </p>

<p>Dr. Marie Nyswander also commented on opium smoking, in 1956: </p>

<p>There is a pattern of self-limitation or restraint in opium
smoking as practiced in countries where it is socially
acceptable. It is common for natives of these countries to
indulge in opium smoking one night a week, much as Americans may
indulge in alcoholic beverages at a Saturday night party....
families who accept opium smoking as part of their culture are
mindful of its dangers much as we are mindful of the dangers of
overindulgence in alcohol.22</p>

<p>The reasons for the lesser harmfulness of opium smoking in
moderation are not hard to find. The opium used, as noted above,
is of a specially weak type containing less than 9 percent
morphine. Only about 10 percent of the morphine in this weak
opium enters the vapor, and only a portion of the morphine in the
vapor enters the human bloodstream when inhaled. Since the opium
is heated rather than burned, only smoke-free vapor is inhaled;
there are no &quot;tars&quot; or other carcinogens to cause
cancer. The so-called &quot;opium smoker&quot; is actually a
vapor inhaler. At a very rough estimate, a smoker would have to
smoke 300 or 400 grains of opium to get a dose equivalent to the
intravenous injection (&quot;mainlining-) of one grain of heroin.
Even heavy opium smokers actually smoke less than this daily..
And the opium-smoking dose is necessarily spread over a
considerable span of time rather than being absorbed into the
bloodstream almost instantaneously, as in mainlining. Surely the
nineteenth-century enemies of opium smoking did not and could not
foresee that the new laws were starting this country down the
dismal road from that relatively innocent &quot;vice&quot; to the
intravenous injection of heroin-the dominant form of illegal
opiate use today; yet that was in fact the sequel.</p>

<p>~ Dr. Charles B. Towns wrote (1912) &quot;The average
opium-smoker consuming twenty-five pills a day gets only the
equivalent of about a quarter grain [15 milligrams] of morphine
taken hypodermically or of a half grain taken by the mouth. A
beginner could not smoke a quarter of that quantity.... 22</p>

<p>Dr. Lawrence Kolb wrote (1925): &quot;Case 35, now
thirty-eight years of age, started smoking opium twenty years ago
[in 1905]. After the importation of smoking opium was prevented
by law, he used morphine, and when this could no longer be
secured, he changed to heroin.&quot; This was the common pattern.</p>

<p> <b>TECHNOLOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE
ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> <b>US Government Office of Technology Assessment</b> </p>

<p> October 18, 1994 </p>

<p> <b>CHAPTER 2 INTRODUCTION </b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> Substance abuse and addiction are pervasive in our society,
with their consequences felt by people in every economic, social,
racial, and political boundary. </p>

<p> The United States has grappled with problems associated with
substance abuse and addiction for over a century (see appendix A
and table 2-1). In 1986, then-President Ronald Reagan launched
what has become known as the war on drugs. Federal spending to
combat drugs increased from $1.5 billion in 1981 to more than $12
billion in 1994, with spending in 1995 projected to pass the $13
billion mark (see table 2-2). Nearly two-thirds of the federal
antidrug budget goes toward efforts to curb the supply of drugs
(e.g., border interdiction, law enforcement), with the remainder
being spent on drug treatment and prevention programs. While the
use of illegal drugs has declined in the United States in recent
years, a vigorous debate continues as to whether the nation is
indeed winning the war on drugs, and what the balance of federal
effort should be in formulating programs to decrease the supply
of drugs, treat drug abusers and addicts, and educate Americans
about problems associated with drug abuse and addiction. </p>

<p> Congress has enacted a number of laws in an attempt to create
a national policy to fight the scourge of drug abuse and
addiction. As part of oversight responsibility for national drug
policy, several committees of Congress have requested the Office
of Technology Assessment (OTA) to undertake a study addressing
the socioeconomic, psychological, physiological, and genetic
underpinnings of substance abuse and addiction (see table 2-3). </p>

<p> OTA has been asked to address a number of questions: </p>

<ul>
    <li> o What are the root causes of substance abuse and
        addiction? </li>
    <li> o Why and how does addiction occur? </li>
    <li> o Who are the substance abusers? </li>
    <li> o What factors, scientific and social, lead to
        addiction? </li>
    <li> o What are the implications for prevention? </li>
</ul>

<p> ROOT CAUSES </p>

<p> At the outset, OTA was asked to address the root causes of
substance abuse and addiction. The term root causes has been used
in political discussions and debate (see box 2-1), and although
many people have strongly held opinions as to what constitutes
the root causes of drug abuse, no consensus exists as to what, if
anything, is inherent in every case of substance abuse and
addiction. OTA conducted a search of various bibliographic
databases, which revealed only limited discussion about root
causes of drug abuse (2). </p>

<p> Research into drug abuse looks not at root causes per se, but
rather at risk and protective factors that increase or decrease
the possibility that substance abuse and addiction will occur
(see table 2-4), and how these risk and protective factors affect
various subpopulations in different settings. </p>

<p> WHAT ARE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND ADDICTION? </p>

<p> Drug consumption is divided into three levels or stages
commonly distinguished by clinicians and researchers: use, abuse,
and dependence (see figure 2-1). Each of these stages is, on
average, more hazardous, more obtrusive, and more likely to
provoke or induce social interventions (e.g., punitive sanctions,
attention by prevention programs, admission to treatment) than
the one before (4). A substance is abusable if it has the
capacity to induce dependence in those who use it. Dependence, a
term that is often used interchangeably with the term addiction,
can include psychological dependence (a form of obsessive
behavior whose objective is the attainment of pleasure or the
avoidance of unpleasantness) and physical dependence (development
of tolerance, causing the user to need increasing amounts of the
drug for it to have its desired effect, and withdrawal symptoms
if drug use is stopped) (5). </p>

<p> Nevertheless, there is considerable controversy about what
constitutes substance abuse and addiction. A number of issues
come into play, such as: </p>

<p> o What substance is being used? A wide range of psychoactive
substances has the potential for abuse (see box 2-2). The
possession and use of several substances--such as marijuana,
heroin, cocaine--are illegal in all 50 states. Other addictive
substances--such as tobacco and alcohol--may be legally
purchased, possessed, and consumed by a majority of Americans.
Other abusable substances--such as inhalants-- may be legally
purchased, possessed, and consumed by anybody. </p>

<p> o Does experimental use constitute abuse? Some maintain that
any use of an abusable or addictive substance constitutes abuse.
Others suggest that experimentation-- particularly with such
psychoactive substances as alcohol or tobacco that are available
for purchase by adults of legal age--is part of normal
development and does not necessarily have harmful consequences. </p>

<p> o In what context are substance abuse and addiction being
addressed? Four broad arenas that encounter substance abuse
related issues include: mass communications, criminal justice,
medicine, and public health. These entities often operate
independently of one another, and use substantially different
terms when describing the use of illicit substances or the
illegal use of licit substances (see appendix C). </p>

<p> Public Health Model </p>

<p> The traditional public health model incorporates the host-
agent-environment relationship. Each of these factors has an
individual, as well as an interrelated role in the potential use
and/or harmful use of a substance. Host factors may include
possible genetic, psychological, and biological susceptibility.
Agent factors incorporate the substance's abuse liability
capacity, as well as how the substance is marketed. Lastly,
environmental factors encompass not only the availability of the
substance, but the social, cultural, political, and economic
climate as well. The focus of the public health perspective is to
understand the importance social norms, environment, and
availability play in the shaping of alcohol- and drug-related
problems both on an individual and societal level. </p>

<p> The public health approach toward substance abuse has several
defining characteristics: </p>

<p> o The substance abuse problem is primarily one of health, and
risks for ill-health. In every recreational, mood- altering drug
user, use increases the risk of contracting one or more diseases
or conditions damaging to one's health. Drug use always creates
the potential, from great to small, for developing one or more
drug-related health problems. </p>

<p> o The legality or illegality of a drug is an artificial
barrier that is not as relevant as the health-related
considerations stemming from all types of drug use. Rather than
using legal/illegal, the public health approach categorizes drugs
by such characteristics as addictive potential and long-term
health risks. </p>

<p> o The drug abuse problem and the drug-related crime problem
are not one and the same. As two distinct, interrelated problems,
they have different, interrelated solutions. </p>

<p> o Dealing with the drug problem primarily as a moral problem
is considered inappropriate and counterproductive. </p>

<p> Medical Model </p>

<p> Within the fields of medicine, the two most frequently cited
texts for the definitions of substance abuse and dependence are
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)
issued by the American Psychiatric Association and used widely in
American medical practice, and the International Classification
of Diseases (ICD) published by the World Health Organization
(WHO). </p>

<p> The current ICD and DSM definitions of substance dependence
are nearly identical. However, the two manuals differ sharply on
the concepts of abuse, which DSM classifies as a maladaptive
pattern of substance use leading to impairment or distress, as
manifested by one or more of several events occurring over the
same 12-month period (e.g., failure to fulfill major role
obligations at work, school, or home; recurrent substance-related
legal problems, such as arrests for substance-related disorderly
conduct. The current ICD-10 category of harmful use, while
applicable cross-culturally, is limited to a pattern of
psychoactive substance use that is causing damage to health. The
damage may be physical, as in cases of hepatitis from the
self-administration of injected drugs, or mental, such as
episodes of depressive disorder secondary to heavy consumption of
alcohol (see appendix C for a full discussion of DSM and ICD
definitions). </p>

<p> Criminal Justice Model </p>

<p> While it is well-known that many crimes are committed by
persons with substance use disorders and that these disorders can
be major contributors to their crimes, the criminal justice
system has no systematic policy for the evaluation of these
disorders. In many jurisdictions, whether federal, state, or
local, the prevailing sentiment is that any use of an illicit
substance and/or use of a licit substance in an illegal manner is
considered criminal abuse. A limited set of quantitative analyses
including blood, urine, and breath tests can be performed to
detect illegal levels of alcohol and/or the presence of illicit
substances. Besides the limited amount of testing and evaluation,
psychological screening examinations or structured interviews are
used infrequently to determine the level and severity of use,
abuse, or dependence. </p>

<p> For purposes of this report, OTA does not adopt any single
definition for the terms substance abuse or substance
addiction/dependence. The focus of this report, the underlying
causes of substance abuse and addiction, relates to each of the
definitions discussed above. </p>

<p> MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM </p>

<p> The abuse of licit and illicit drugs represents a major
public health problem in the United States. Abuse of alcohol and
other drugs has been associated with many problems (see figure
2-2) costing Americans an estimated $144.1 billion annually. </p>

<p> Federal survey data estimate that 11.4 million Americans aged
12 and older used illegal drugs in 1992, continuing a steady
decline from a peak of 24 million in 1979. Findings from the 1992
National Household Survey found the following about specific
drugs: </p>

<p> o Illegal drugs. Since 1979, overall rates of current use
(defined as use within the last 30 days) have dropped in all age
groups, except those aged 35 and older, whose use of drugs has
remained level. This has resulted in a general shift in the age
distribution of illegal drug users. In 1992, 23 percent of
illegal drug users were aged 35 and older, compared with only 10
percent in 1979. </p>

<p> o Cocaine. The number of cocaine users decreased 31 percent
from 1.9 million users in 1991 to 1.3 million in 1992. This is
down from a peak of 5.8 million in 1985. The number of occasional
users (defined as those who used the drug in 1992 but less often
than monthly) also continued a sharp decline from 4.3 million in
1991 to 3.4 million in 1992. This is down from a peak of 8.6
million in 1985. Frequent use of cocaine (defined as use on a
weekly basis) remained unchanged between 1991 and 1992. In fact,
no significant change has occurred in this number since it was
first estimated in 1985. </p>

<p> o Marijuana. This is the most common illegal drug--used by 78
percent of all illegal drug users in 1992. </p>

<p> o Other illegal drugs. No major changes in the prevalence of
the use of hallucinogens, such as lysergic acid diethylamide
(LSD) and phencyclidine (PCP), between 1991 and 1992. The survey
estimates that approximately 1.8 million Americans have used
heroin at least once. However, the data on these categories are
somewhat unreliable, as these users are less likely to be
contacted and reported in a household survey. </p>

<p> o Alcohol. In 1992, approximately 98 million persons over the
age of 12 had used alcohol in the last month, which is
approximately 48 percent of the population aged 12 and older.
This number is down from an estimated high of 106 million
drinkers in 1988. The number of heavy drinkers (defined as having
five or more drinks per occasion on five or more days in the past
month) has remained steady at an estimated 9 million people. </p>

<p> o Tobacco. An estimated 54 million Americans were smokers in
1992, a rate of 26 percent of the population aged 12 and older.
Cigarette smoking has declined since 1988, when an estimated 57
million Americans smoked cigarettes. </p>

<p> o Smokeless tobacco. An estimated 7.5 million Americans used
smokeless tobacco in 1992, the vast majority of whom (7.1
million) were males. </p>

<p> o Inhalants. The use of inhalants (e.g., gasoline, glue, and
nitrites) dropped slightly in 1992 as compared to 1991. </p>

<p> o Prescription drugs. The estimated current nonmedical use of
psychotherapeutics (sedatives, tranquilizers, stimulants, or
analgesics) dropped from 1991 to 1992. </p>

<p> The survey also provides demographic variables useful to
understanding substance use and abuse in the United States (see
box 2-3). However, these figures, as all data on drug use, are
suspect. Most surveys have strengths and weaknesses, which have
led stakeholders and policymakers to make widely divergent
conclusions based on the same sets of data. </p>

<p> MEASURING SUBSTANCE USE AND ABUSE </p>

<p> Like the old fable about blind men describing an elephant,
individual drug statistics usually tell us only part of the story
(13). Each survey provides useful information, but at the same
time, each survey is flawed. Currently, no single measurement can
by itself describe drug use and abuse in all its complexity.
Nonetheless, several useful indicators do provide information to
policymakers. </p>

<p> Three major national drug monitoring systems are the primary
data source for this review: The National Household Survey on
Drug Abuse (the Household Survey), the National Survey of High
School Seniors (the Seniors Survey), and the Drug Abuse Warning
Network (DAWN). These continuing data series have been sponsored
by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) since the 1970s.
Supplementary data sources include the few small area studies
that compare drug use by poverty or income status and the Drug
Use Forecasting System (DUF), sponsored by the National Institute
of Justice, which provides quarterly estimates of drug use among
the criminal population in selected cities. </p>

<p> National Household Survey on Drug Abuse </p>

<p> Since 1974, NIDA has commissioned the Household Survey every
one to three years. The survey is based on a multistage random
sample of the household population in the 48 contiguous United
States. The sample excludes persons living in group quarters,
including institutions, prisons, military quarters, and college
dormitories, and those with no permanent address, including the
homeless. </p>

<p> Since 1985, a number of enhancements have been made to the
Household Survey. In 1985, blacks and Hispanics were oversampled
to provide additional cases for subgroup analyses, and new
measures of drug use frequency were introduced to identify
persons who used drugs monthly and weekly during the previous
year. In 1991, special supplementary samples were added for six
metropolitan areas with highly publicized drug problems.
Similarly, reports published since the early 1980s provide
greater detail on the demographic characteristics of users by
frequency of use. </p>

<p> National Survey of High School Seniors </p>

<p> Every year since 1975 researchers at the University of
Michigan have surveyed a nationally representative sample of
approximately 16,000 high school seniors. Beginning in 1976, a
followup survey of members from each graduating class, including
an over-sampling of drug users, has been conducted by mail. In
1990, the followup sample included young adults aged 19 to 32. </p>

<p> Drug Abuse Warning Network </p>

<p> DAWN, established in 1972, is the federal government's major
data system for tracking patterns and trends in the serious
health consequences of drug use. DAWN reports include statistics
on the total number of hospital emergency room visits (episodes),
separate counts of the number of drugs mentioned per episode
(drug mentions), and drug-related deaths. </p>

<p> Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the DAWN program focused
primarily on data from emergency rooms and medical examiners in
27 metropolitan areas. The selection of reporting facilities,
over 700 emergency rooms and 87 medical examiners by 1989, was
not random, however, and the number of facilities reporting
varied from year to year, with facilities in metropolitan areas
being overrepresented. Beginning in 1990, DAWN implemented a
national probability sample for the collection of drug-related
emergency room visit data to allow reporting of national as well
as metropolitan area information. </p>

<p> Drug Use Forecasting System </p>

<p> DUF, initiated in 1988 by the Department of Justice, provides
estimates of drug use among booked arrestees in selected cities
based on urinalysis tests. The tests, administered shortly after
arrest, measure very recent drug use among lawbreakers. Four
times a year, samples of about 250 male adult arrestees in
participating cities are tested; some areas also test female
arrestees and juveniles. The proportion of persons arrested
explicitly on drug charges is limited to 25 percent of the total
sample. </p>

<p> Limitations of the Data </p>

<p> The national drug monitoring surveys have several limitations
for studying drug use, abuse, and addiction: </p>

<p> o Most surveys rely on self-reporting. The results of such
surveys rely on the veracity of the person responding to the
survey. A major, and widely recognized, limitation in the
national surveys is that respondents may be unwilling or unable
to report their drug use accurately. Comparisons of self-report
and urinalysis results based on DUF data indicate that, among
arrestees, the tendency to underreport drug use is substantial
(12). As one Member of Congress noted, &quot;how in the hell can
you expect people who live in households to share with anybody,
let alone the government, how often they use drugs?&quot; (3). </p>

<p> o Surveys miss populations at risk for drug abuse.
TheHousehold Survey, by definition, excludes certain groups who
do not reside in households, such as the homeless and persons in
jail or prison. Although the excluded groups represent only 2
percent of the total population, drug use may be higher, or
different, among excluded groups such as the homeless and jail or
prison inmates. The Household Survey may also fail to capture
drug users within the target population. Although overall survey
response rates are high (82 percent in 1990), drugs users may
have been more difficult to locate and interview because their
lifestyles may involve irregular hours, avoiding authority, and
other behaviors that reduce the likelihood of survey response. In
addition, response rates tend to be generally lower among young
adults and residents of metropolitan and low-income areas, and
those not interviewed may be more likely to use drugs than those
who respond to the survey. </p>

<p> o Poverty indicators per se are not available. The national
drug monitoring systems contain very limited data on poverty, and
none that meet the official poverty definition (in 1991, the
poverty thresholds varied from $6,932 for a person living alone
to $27,942 for a family of nine or more members (6). The proxy
variables relating to employment, education, place of residence,
and race and ethnicity unsuccessfully separate the effects of
income from the effects of other correlated factors. Information
on drug use by income status is available only in the most recent
Household Surveys, and then only by family income without regard
to household size. More information is provided by the Household
Survey on other variables related to poverty, including
employment status, race and ethnicity, and neighborhood
characteristics. The Seniors Survey provides no income data. For
high school seniors, the only regularly reported indicators of
socioeconomic status are college plans and parental education. No
socioeconomic indicators are available for the followup sample of
young adults except current enrollment in college. Race and
ethnic status are not regularly reported for either sample, but
for high school seniors racial and ethnic patterns of drug use
are analyzed and published separately. DAWN has severe
limitations for an analysis of poverty and drug use. The only
indicators in DAWN related to poverty are race and ethnicity. No
data are available on income status of patients or the economic
status of areas served by the facility. </p>

<p> o Surveys may over- and underrepresent findings regarding
populations at risk for drug abuse. Populations at risk for both
poverty and drug abuse, for example, are excluded or
underrepresented in the major surveys and overrepresented in
reports from hospital emergency rooms. These problems mean that
the findings from these surveys are suggestive rather than
definitive (see box 2-4). </p>

<p> o Drug measures focus on use, rather than abuse or addiction.
The common measures of drug use employed by the Household and
Seniors Surveys--lifetime, past year, and past month use--are
insufficiently refined to distinguish between casual and
dependent drug use. Definitions of alcohol, drug abuse, and
dependency --such as those set forth in DSM (1)-- link the
quantity and frequency of use to indications of persistent,
uncontrolled consumption, impaired social and psychological
functioning as a result of use, and physical problems including
withdrawal symptoms. No published estimates of the number of drug
users meeting medical criteria for abuse or dependence by poverty
indicators are available, with the single exception of the DAWN
estimates of emergency room contacts for dependency, which are
reported by race and ethnicity. </p>

<p> o The surveys include few multivariate analyses. Since the
surveys do not examine variables while controlling for factors
related to drug use, an accurate link of drug use with the role
of income, race, education, and place of residence is impossible.
The dearth of such analyses results in part from sample size
limitations and in part from the fact that secondary analyses of
the national survey data have not been encouraged. </p>

<p> ORGANIZATION AND SCOPE OF THE REPORT </p>

<p> This report has four parts: necessary preconditions,
individual factors, community contexts, and policy options. </p>

<p> The first part, Necessary Preconditions (chs. 3-5), focuses
on several factors necessary for substance abuse to occur. The
second part, Individual Factors (ch. 6), explores research
conducted on risk and protective factors thought to be indicators
in assessing an individual's substance use, abuse, and addiction.
The third part, Activity Settings (chs. 7 and 8), looks at how
risk and protective factors play out in various population
subgroups and in various community settings (home, school,
workplace, recreation, and neighborhood). The fourth section,
Policy Options (ch. 9), addresses the range of legislative issues
and options for Congress arising from chapters 3 through 8. </p>

<p> This report focuses on factors that contribute to or protect
against substance abuse and addiction, and the implications for
prevention. It does not address in any depth drug treatment or
law enforcement issues and interventions. Based on the
literatures reviewed by OTA about causes and prevention, however,
it is clear that comprehensive prevention strategies will
generally need drug treatment and law enforcement components, if
they are to be effective. While drawing on data from federal
antidrug prevention programs, the effectiveness of such
approaches needs to be studied in greater depth than was possible
in this report. </p>

<p> This report is the second and final publication of this
assessment. The first publication, a background report on
Biological Components of Substance Abuse and Addiction, described
genetic, pharmacological, and abuse liability research issues
(9). Readers are also referred to earlier OTA reports that
address issues related to drug interdiction efforts (10);
alcohol, tobacco, and drug abuse prevention and services issues
in adolescent health (7); the effectiveness of drug abuse
treatment in controlling AIDS/HIV infection (11); and alternative
coca reduction strategies (8).<br>
</p>

<p> BOX 2-1: Root Causes: Two Views From the Political Arena </p>

<p> &quot;Many states and cities are on shoe-string budgets and
must provide services and alternatives to substance abuse in
local communities. The failure to address the fundamental causes
of substance abuse and to provide immediate intervention
strategies will impact city residents most... The committee
recommends that the National Drug Control Strategy be framed by
broader social and economic problems which require dramatic
reforms in order to attack the root causes of substance abuse. We
need to begin to build the infrastructure necessary to improve
the quality of treatment services by requiring medical schools to
provide comprehensive training to identify and treat substance
abusers; provide adequate treatment services at the community
level, including after care, vocational, educational, and
psychiatric assessments; and develop alternative leisure
activities for youth and adults to replace `street life' and
assist individuals to escape the drug culture.&quot; </p>

<p> House Committee on Government Operations committee report </p>

<p> &quot;One of [the Democrats'] tactics was to talk about the
root causes of drug use, the `deeper and more profound problems,'
as they put it, of homelessness, poverty, helplessness, and the
like. The elites liked this shift in emphasis, too. It took the
discussion away from moral considerations to the (for them) more
comfortable ground of social theory. They wanted to talk about
`hopelessness' as a condition caused by lack of government
involvement. We talked about hopelessness, too, but talked about
it as a condition caused by social decomposition and the
breakdown of the family and a lack of law and order in these
communities . . . I found it shocking and disappointing that when
we argued for more police, jails, courts, and prisons because of
the exploding crime epidemic in some of America's inner cities,
some people responded by saying, `But what are the root causes of
this? `That's an interesting debate which should go on at an
elite university. But if there are drug dealers going around
shooting people in the affluent suburbs, the citizenry will not
call for a seminar on root causes. They will raise hell and
demand that the dealers be arrested. And they are right to do
so.&quot; </p>

<p> BOX 2-2: Overview of Alcohol and Some Other Psychoactive
Substances <br>
</p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> ALCOHOL (ethyl alcohol) </p>

<p> Alcohol, one of the most widely used of all drugs, is a
central nervous system depressant with effects similar to those
of sedative-hypnotic compounds (see below). At low doses, alcohol
may be associated with behavioral excitation thought to be due to
the depression of inhibitory neurons in the brain. Alcohol
differs from sedative-hypnotic compounds in that it is used
primarily for recreation or social rather than medical purposes. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Beer. 2. Wine. 3. &quot;Hard&quot; liquor (e.g., whiskey,
gin).<br>
</p>

<p> SEDATIVES, HYPNOTICS, OR ANXIOLYTICS Sedative-hypnotics are
drugs of diverse chemical structure that exert a nonselective
general depressant on the central nervous system. In addition,
they reduce metabolism in a variety of tissues in the body,
depressing any system that uses energy. Depending on the dose,
any sedative hypnotic compound may be classified as a sedative
(an agent that allays excitement), a tranquilizer (an antianxiety
agent), a hypnotic (a sleep-inducing agent), or an anesthetic (an
agent that eliminates pain). Sedative-hypnotics are used
medically as sedatives, anxiolytics (antianxiety agents),
hypnotics, antiepileptics, muscle relaxants, and general
anesthetics. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Barbiturates (&quot;downers&quot; or &quot;barbs&quot;):
pentobarbital sodium[NembutalR], secobarbital sodium [SeconalR],
amobarbital [AmytalR]--taken orally. </p>

<p> 2. Nonbarbiturate hypnotics: methaqualone [QuaaludesR]--
taken orally. </p>

<p> 3. Tranquilizers: diazepam [ValiumR], chlordiazepoxide
hydrochloride [LibriumR]--taken orally.<br>
</p>

<p> CANNABIS (THC) THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) the active agent in
marijuana, alters perceptions, concentration, emotions, and
behavior, though the mechanisms of action are not entirely clear.
Researchers have found, however, that THC changes the way in
which sensory information is processed by the brain. It can be
used medically to relieve nausea and side effects of chemotherapy
in cancer patients; it is very rarely used to treat glaucoma. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Marijuana (&quot;pot&quot; or &quot;grass&quot;)--smoked
or eaten. 2. Hashish (&quot;hash&quot;)--smoked or eaten. 3.
Hashish oil (&quot;hash oil&quot;)--smoked (mixed with tobacco.
4. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-- taken orally in capsules.<br>
</p>

<p> NICOTINE Nicotine, obtained naturally from tobacco, is a
central nervous system stimulant.(c) It exerts its action
secondary to stimulation of certain cholinergic (excitatory)
synapses both within the brain and in the peripheral nervous
system. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Cigarettes. 2. Smokeless tobacco (e.g., snuff or chewing
tobacco). <br>
</p>

<p> COCAINE Cocaine, obtained naturally from coca leaves, is a
potent central nervous system stimulant.(c) It stimulates the
sympathetic nervous system, which regulates the activity of
cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and glands. It also produces
bronchodilation in the lungs. It is used medically as a topical
anesthetic for surgical procedures. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Cocaine hydrochloride powder (&quot;coke&quot; or
&quot;street cocaine&quot;)--usually snorted or injected
intravenously.d </p>

<p> 2. Cocaine alkaloid (&quot;freebase&quot; or
&quot;crack&quot;)--smoked.e <br>
</p>

<p> AMPHETAMINES AND RELATED STIMULANTSf 1. Amphetamines
Amphetamines are a group of three closely related compounds, all
of which are potent central nervous system and behavioral
stimulants.(c) Some amphetamines are used medically to treat
attention deficit disorder or minimal brain dysfunction in
children, narcolepsy (recurrent, uncontrollable, brief episodes
of sleep), or (rarely) depression. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Amphetamine (&quot;speed&quot; or &quot;uppers&quot;
(BenzedrineR]--taken orally, injected, or snorted.(g) </p>

<p> 2. Methamphetamine (&quot;speed&quot; or &quot;crystal
meth&quot; or &quot;ice&quot;) [MethadrineR]--taken orally,
injected, or snorted.(g,h) </p>

<p> 3. Dextroamphetamine [DexedrineR]--taken orally, or injected.
<br>
</p>

<p> 2. Nonamphetamine stimulants Like amphetamines,
nonamphetamine stimulates are central nervous and behavioral
stimulants. Some non-amphetamine stimulants (e.g., PreludinR) are
used for weight control, and some (e.g., RitalinR and CylertR)
are used medically to treat hyperactivity, minimal brain
dysfunction, narcolepsy, or (rarely) depression. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Pheumetrazine hydrochloride [PreludinR]--taken orally or
injected.d </p>

<p> 2. Methylphenidate hydrochloride injected.d </p>

<p> 3. Pemoline [CylertR]--taken orally. [RitalinR]--taken
orally, or injected.(d) </p>

<p> HALLUCINOGENS Hallucinogens, or psychedelics, are a
heterogeneous group of compounds that affect a person's
perceptions, sensations, thinking, self-awareness, and
emotions.(i) </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) or
&quot;acid&quot;--taken orally or put in the eyes. </p>

<p> 2. Mescaline (3,4,5-trimethylox- phenylethyl amide) or
&quot;mesc&quot; and peyote--disks chewed, swallowed, or smoked;
tablets taken orally. </p>

<p> 3. Psilocybin (&quot;magic mushrooms&quot;)--chewed and
swallowed. 4. MDMA (methylene dioxymethamphetamine)--taken
orally. </p>

<p> INHALANTS Inhalants are chemicals that produce psychoactive
vapors. Although different in makeup, nearly all of the abused
inhalants produce effects similar to those of anesthetics, which
act to slow down the body's functions or produce feelings of
dizziness. At low doses, users may feel slightly stimulated. Amyl
nitrite is used for heart patients because it dilates the blood
vessels and increases blood supply to the heart. There are no
medical indications for most of the inhalants. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Solvents (model airplane glue, nail polish remover,
lighter and cleaning fluids, and gasoline)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> 2. Aerosols (e.g., paints, hairsprays)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> 3. Some anesthetics (e.g.,nitrous oxide)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> 4. Amyl nitrite (&quot;snappers&quot; or &quot;poppers&quot;)
and butyl nitrite (&quot;rush&quot;)--vapors inhaled.<br>
</p>

<p> OPIATES (NARCOTICS) AND RELATED ANALGESICS Opiates are
natural or synthetic drugs that, like morphine, a substance
derived from the opium poppy, have analgesic (pain-relieving)
properties. Heroin is not approved for medical uses in the United
States. The major medical use of other opiates is for the relief
of pain (i.e., as analgesics); some narcotics are used to relieve
coughing (i.e., as antitussives) or to treat diarrhea. Methadone
is used in the treatment of narcotic abstinence syndromes and as
an analgesic in terminal illness.<br>
</p>

<p> 1. Heroin (&quot;smack&quot; or &quot;horse&quot;)--
injected, smoked, or inhaledd. </p>

<p> 2. Codeine (codeine sulfate)--taken orally or injected.d </p>

<p> 3. Morphine (morphine hydrochloride)--injected, smoked, or
inhaled. </p>

<p> 4. Synthetic opiates (e.g., methadone [DolophineR]);
hydromorphone hydrochloride [DilaudidR], meperidine hydrochloride
[DemerolR], oxycodone and asprin [PercodanR]-- taken orally or
injected. </p>

<p> PCP (PHENCYCLIDINE) AND SIMILARLY ACTING SYMPHATHOMIMETICS </p>

<p> Phencycyclidine, commonly referred to as PCP, alters the
functions of the neocortex and has been called a dissociative
anesthetic. It was developed in the 1950s as an anesthetic but
was subsequently taken off the market in 1967 when it was
discovered that the drug caused hallucinations in some people.(j)
PCP is now used legally only in veterinary medicine as an
immobilizing agent. </p>

<p> PCP (&quot;angel dust&quot; or &quot;lovely&quot;)--taken
orally, or smoked (sprayed on joints or cigarettes).(d) </p>

<p> ______________ (a) According to Julien, one could conceivably
classify psychoactive drugs by at least three methods: 1)
mechanism of action, 2) chemical structure, and 3) behavioral
effects. Probably the most useful approach would be to classify
them by mechanism of action, but knowledge of the brain's
physiology is too limited for this approach to be comprehensive.
A limitation of the second approach is that many drugs of
apparently similar structure exert quite different effects, and
many drugs of dissimilar structure exert quite similar effects.
The classification in this table largely reflects the behavioral
effects approach. The classification used here is based on the
categories in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd ed., revised.
According to the American Psychiatric Association, all of the
classes of psychoactive substances listed in this box except
nicotine are associated with both abuse and dependence. Nicotine
is associated with dependence but not abuse. </p>

<p> (b) The potential physiological, psychological, and
behavioral effects of using the psychoactive substance shown are
discussed in the sources listed below. The consequences depend in
part on the specific drug used, the dosage level and mode of
administration. </p>

<p> (c) Central nervous system stimulants are drugs that can
elevate mood, increase alertness, reduce fatigue, provide a sense
of increased energy, decrease appetite, and improve task
performance. They can also produce anxiety, insomnia, and
irritability. The drugs differ widely in their molecular
structures and mechanisms of action. </p>

<p> (d) According to the American Psychiatric Association, the
route of administration of a psychoactive substance is an
important variable in determining whether use will lead to
dependence or abuse. In general, routes of administration that
produce more efficient absorption of the substance in the blood
stream (e.g., intravenous injection) tend to increase the
likelihood of an escalating pattern of substance uses that leads
to dependence. Routes that quickly deliver psychoactive
substances to the brain (e.g., smoking or intravenous injection)
are associated with higher levels of consumption and with an
increased likelihood of toxic effects. Use of contaminated
needles for intravenous administration of amphetamines, cocaine,
and opiates can cause hepatitis, HIV infection, and other
illnesses. </p>

<p> (e) Freebase cocaine is a form of cocaine made by converting
&quot;street cocaine&quot; (cocaine hydrochloride) to a purified
base that is smoked. The effect of smoking freebase is similar to
that of intravenous injection but smoking provides a shorter more
intense high than sniffing or ingestion because of the rapid
absorption of the drug through the lungs. &quot;Crack
cocaine&quot; is the street name given to freebase cocaine that
has been processed from cocaine hydrochloride to a chemical base
by cooking it with baking soda and water. The term crack refers
to the cracking sound that is heard when the mixture is smoked
(heated), presumably due to the sodium bicarbonate. </p>

<p> (f) Describing a drug as a stimulant does not adequately
describe its properties. Drug use surveys typically mean
amphetamines when they use the word stimulants. Some surveys
regard as stimulants both prescription (amphetamines) and
nonprescription substances (e.g., caffeine-based compounds used
in No-Doz, diet pills, and &quot;fake pep pills&quot;). Cocaine
and nicotine (described above) are also central nervous system
simulants. </p>

<p> (g) According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
designer drugs are structural analogs of substances scheduled
under the Controlled Substances Act that are prepared by
underground chemists to mimic the psychoactive effects of
controlled substances or produce other psychoactive effects.
Because such analogs are not identical to their parent compound,
their manufacture and distribution does not violate the law. As
of June 1986, there were synthetic analogs of PCP, fentanyl and
meperidine, and amphetamine and methamphetamine. </p>

<p> (h) In the past, abuse of methamphetamine had been in the
form of tablets or intravenous injection. More recently,
&quot;ice&quot; (one of the common street names for
d-methamphetamine hydrochloride) has gained popularity in a form
suitable for smoking. </p>

<p> (i) Most of the agents in this class of drugs can induce
hallucinations if the dose is high enough. But the term
hallucinogen does not adequately describe the range of
pharmacological actions of the diverse group of substances
usually included in the class. The term psychedelic was proposed
by Osmond in 1957 to imply that these agents all have the ability
to alter the sensory perception and thus may be considered
&quot;mind expanding.&quot; The effects of hallucinogens are
unpredictable and depend on the amount taken, the user's
personality, mood and expectations, and the surroundings in which
the drug is used. </p>

<p> (j) PCP is considered a hallucinogen in some surveys of drug
use.<br>

<p> BOX 2-3: Household Survey Demographic Portrait According to
the 1992 National Household Survey on DrugAbuse:o Illegal drug
use is most prevalent in the 18- to 25-yearage group.o Most

correlated with educationalstatus. Those who had not completed

<p> BOX 2-4: Two Contrasting Surveys Measuring Cocaine Use </p>

<p> Because of populations not represented in the Household
Surveys (including homeless, run-away children, and
institutionalized populations such as the incarcerated), the
surveys may greatly underestimate the involvement of the poor in
drug use. Two years ago, for example, Abt Associates conducted a
study to determine the number of heavy cocaine users in the
United States. Two measures of heavy cocaine use were employed,
both of which measured use of cocaine in the very recent past.
Estimates of the number of regular weekly cocaine users from the
1990 Household Survey were compared to estimates of the number of
recent cocaine users based on urinalysis tests of arrestees from
the Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program. DUF urinalysis tests were
conducted at the time of booking, and the results measured
cocaine use during the day or two before arrest. DUF estimates
therefore measured the prevalence of very recent drug use among
those involved with the criminal justice system in selected major
cities. </p>

<p> The two data systems generated significantly different
estimates. From the Household Survey, Abt estimated that there
were about 662,000 heavy cocaine users in this country in 1990.
This is substantially lower than the Abt estimate of 1.709
million heavy cocaine users derived from DUF data. Reasons for
the differences include both possible underreporting on the
Household Survey and the fact that many heavy cocaine users may
be excluded from the household population or may be exceedingly
difficult to locate and interview. Overall, the study indicated
that approximately two-thirds of the heavy cocaine users in this
country are not counted by the Household Survey and that
approximately 87 percent of all heavy cocaine users are involved
with the criminal justice system. </p>

<p> <b>TECHNOLOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE
ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> <b>US Government Office of Technology Assessment</b> </p>

<p> October 18, 1994 </p>

<p> <b>CHAPTER 5 </b> </p>

<p> <b>SUBSTANCE USE AND TRANSITIONS TO ABUSE AND ADDICTION <br>
</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> Substance use is another precondition and contributor to
addiction, since one cannot become dependent on a substance
without first using it, continuing its use, and passing through
stages of progressively more serious use. </p>

<p> Patterns of progression from use to addiction are not,
however, consistent or predictable for all individuals. They can
vary widely, depending on numerous individual and contextual
factors and on characteristics of the use itself, such as age of
onset and the type, frequency, and quantity of substance used.
While other chapters in this report focus on individual and
contextual factors, this chapter focuses only on the
characteristics of drug use itself that can contribute to the
progression to abuse and addiction. </p>

<p> Researchers have failed to identify specific levels of
substance use or of substance-related problems that clearly
distinguish use from abuse (16). This is the case, in part,
because substances can differ greatly in their abuse liability
and, in part, because the same levels of use of a particular
substance can affect the functioning of various individuals
differently. For example, for some individuals, the initial use
of certain substances may constitute substance abuse, because of
the severe adverse consequences of the initial use itself.
(Although abuse is usually associated with large quantities of
substance use per occasion, resulting in either the risk of harm
to others (e.g., drunk driving) or to self (e.g., blackouts),
some in the prevention field define any initial use of an illicit
substance as substance abuse, because the substance being used is
illicit and should not be used.) </p>

<p> Although the distinction between use and abuse is unclear,
the causes of substance use--especially initial or casual
use--are thought to differ in many cases from the causes of
substance abuse and addiction. Some researchers have asserted
that substance use results primarily from social influences
(e.g., peer pressure), while abuse results more from internal
psychological and physiological processes (13). Others have
reported, based on longitudinal data, that current substance use
was related more to the early modeling of use by adults and to
one's own prior use, whereas problem use was related more to
early rebelliousness (22). A review of prevention programs also
supports the conclusion that the factors associated with the
initiation of use differ from the factors associated with
escalation to abuse (23).<br>
</p>

<p> SUBSTANCE USE <br>
</p>

<p> Because substance use is necessary as a precondition to abuse
and addiction, prevention efforts can be directed at initial use,
continuing use, or progression in use to block the later
development of addiction. </p>

<p> Possible goals are: </p>

<p> o Prevent initial use. One way to prevent substance abuse and
addiction is to prevent any initial use. The surest way to
succeed would be to keep abusable substances out of the
community, since, if they are unavailable, they cannot be used.
However, once the substances are available in a community, other
preventive approaches can be tried, including scare tactics (as
with a policy of zero tolerance, backed up by stern parental,
school, and legal penalties for use), educational efforts
(through media campaigns or prevention curricula in the schools),
training in refusal skills, and promotion of safe
nonsubstance-using activities. The lack of clear standards and
penalties, credible information, and alternative activities may
certainly increase the vulnerability of youth to the appeals of
abusable substances, but the presence of such efforts has not
guaranteed success in preventing initial use among all youth. </p>

<p> o Delay initial use. Another goal is to delay initial use as
long as possible, thus delaying the point at which any
progression from use to abuse to addiction can begin. Such an
approach can provide at least some protection for some
chil-dren--i.e., those who might otherwise initiate use at
earlier ages and then more rapidly progress to abuse and possibly
addiction. Early onset of substance use is often more severe than
late onset and, as is discussed later in this chapter, early use
of substances is one of the better predictors of subsequent
problems. Thus, a delay in initial use may offer significant
protection even if substances are used later on. </p>

<p> o Prevent, reduce, or control continued use. Another approach
is to try to prevent current users from continuing or escalating
their use of one substance or moving on to other substances with
greater abuse liability. Many youth experiment with cigarettes,
alcohol, and marijuana, but do not progress to problematic use of
these or other substances. Others, however, do progress. Efforts
to reduce, prevent, or control continued and progressive use, if
successful, can protect individuals from the problems of abuse
and addiction. </p>

<p> Preventing, delaying, reducing, or controlling the use of
substances can help prevent abuse and addiction. Because of their
directness and apparent simplicity, these goals can be very
appealing. Detracting from their appeal, however, is that they
can be difficult to achieve, especially for multiproblem
individuals in communities where abusable substances are widely
available and aggressively marketed, and for individuals who may
be physiologically predisposed to the continued and escalating
use of substances. </p>

<p> In addition to being a precondition (without which abuse and
addiction become impossible), substance use can also be an
important contributor to later abuse and addiction, by affecting
individuals physiologically, psychologically, and
socioculturally.<br>
</p>

<p> Physiological Effects <br>
</p>

<p> Addictive substances affect processes in the brain, some of
them operating through reward systems, and can produce drug
tolerance and dependence. Tolerance manifests itself when, to
produce a given response (e.g., a high), an individual must
ingest more of a substance. Physiological drug dependence has at
least two defining characteristics: the development of tolerance
to the effects of the drug and the manifestation of symptoms of
withdrawal on abrupt discontinuation or reduction in dosage. The
development of physiological tolerance and dependence can
contribute to the progression from use to abuse and addiction: as
tolerance to a substance increases, an individual must ingest
more of the substance to continue to obtain a given desired
response; as dependency develops, an individual must continue to
ingest the substance to avoid the unpleasant experience of
withdrawal.<br>
</p>

<p> Psychological Effects <br>
</p>

<p> Substance use may contribute to further use and abuse through
psychological means as well. For example, an initial successful
experience of use may reduce an individual's fear about the
substance, thus opening the way to continued use that can lead to
growing tolerance and dependence. </p>

<p> Changes in expectations about the consequences of alcohol use
have also been associated with increases in behavioral tolerance.
Specifically, less impairment from drinking alcohol occurred
when, after the ingestion, successfully performing certain tasks
was rewarded, while all other variables that increase tolerance
were controlled. Several recent studies and a literature review
have found that the ingestion of alcohol increased when the
rewards for alternative behaviors were constrained (24). Also,
social drinkers who expect the effects of alcohol to be better
than the outcomes of other activities may well be more likely to
make the transition to abusive drinking. Such a hypothesis is
supported by several studies that found that alcohol abusers
identify a greater number of favorable conseqences of alcohol
consumption than do nonabusers (24). </p>

<p> Continued use of substances can also impair the learning of
skills, especially among the young, and the ability to remember
lessons once learned. Developmental processes may be slowed,
which may hamper decisionmaking, in general, and about the use of
substances, in particular. However, the progression from use to
abuse may also, in many cases, not be simply linear, as when
individuals move in and out of substance abusing patterns,
depending on the developmental stages and social and cultural
situations and contexts that may be affecting them.<br>
</p>

<p> Sociocultural Effects <br>
</p>

<p> Sociocultural factors, triggered by substance use, can also
contribute to progression in use. An individual who initiates
use, for example, may begin to participate in a subgroup that
encourages use, such as the patrons of crack houses, groups of
heroin users, members of substance-using motorcycle gangs,
adolescent peer groups, cocktail party groups, after-work beer
groups, and groupies who follow certain rock bands. (In some
cases, too, such groups and subcultures may provide the impetus
for the initiation of use as well.) Such social and cultural
environments encourage, reinforce, maintain, and increase
substance use and abuse--all of which can develop after the
initiation of use outside the group. Conversely, the lack of
rewarding, substance-free alternative groups and activities may
render individuals more vulnerable to the appeals of substance-
using groups and subcultures.<br>
</p>

<p> STAGES IN THE INITIATION OF USE <br>
</p>

<p> Do individuals first use one substance (e.g., alcohol or
tobacco) and only later use another (e.g., cocaine or heroin)?
Are stages in the first use of different substances similar
across cultures? Does the use of one substance (e.g., marijuana)
directly increase the likelihood of later use of another
substance (e.g., heroin)? Or is progression in use caused more by
other mediating factors, such as multiple behavior problems? If
so, might these other problems contribute to later use of certain
substances even in the absence of the use of other substances
earlier on? </p>

<p> The basic question about whether there are stages in the
initiation of the use of different substances has been studied in
the United States (9,11,12,21,27) and in Israel and France (1).
While study results vary somewhat, the sequence most often
reported is that alcohol and cigarette use come first, followed
by marijuana use and then by the use of other illicit substances.
Some variations in this sequence have been found for individuals
of different sexes, racial and ethnic groups, and cultures. The
idea that the use of some substances increases the likelihood of
the use of other substances has led to several hypotheses.<br>
</p>

<p> The Stepping Stone Hypothesis <br>
</p>

<p> In its strongest form, the so-called &quot;stepping
stone&quot; hypothesis asserted that the use of marijuana often
or almost always led to violent crime and to the use of other
illicit substances (28). This hypothesis has never been proved.
An even earlier version of the stepping stone hypothesis goes
back to the beginning of the 20th century, when the presumed
progression from tobacco to alcohol to morphine use was presented
as an argument for prohibiting both alcohol and tobacco. One
observer commented that there was no strong evidence that the use
of these substances causes progression from one to another;
rather, some individuals are more prone to the use of multiple
substances. Also, the criminalization of marijuana may have
caused some marijuana users to move on to other illicit
substances through contact with the subculture of illicit users
(14).<br>
</p>

<p> The Gateway Hypothesis <br>
</p>

<p> More recently, a more moderate hypothesis, the gateway
hypothesis, has been put forward. It asserts that use of certain
substances increases somewhat the chances of progression to the
use of other substances. For example, in one longitudinal study,
men who had used both alcohol and cigarettes by age 15 had a 52
percent greater chance of using marijuana, compared to men who
had never used alcohol or cigarettes by age 25 (26). For women,
the increased chance of marijuana use among alcohol and cigarette
users was 46 percent. Similarly, for the next stage, men who had
used marijuana by age 15 had a 68 percent greater chance of
initiating the use of other illicit substances, compared with
those who had never used marijuana. For women, the increased
probability was 53 percent. <br>
</p>

<p> Early and Frequent Use <br>
</p>

<p> A still more constrained version, but one that may be more
predictive, suggests that early and frequent use increases the
probability of movement to later levels in the sequence (12). For
example, researchers have reported that early use of substances
is associated with later problematic use (7,20).<br>
</p>

<p> Nonuse of a Substance at an Earlier Stage <br>
</p>

<p> Another hypothesis proposes that the nonuse of a substance at
an earlier age reduces the chances of later use of other
substances. A longitudinal study has found that the chance that
an individual who had never used marijuana would move up a level
to use other illicit substances was very low (26). This finding
corroborated conclusions reached earlier based on a
cross-sectional study (18). </p>

<p> Because of variations among communities and cultures, the
search for a universally applicable sequence in the initiation of
the use of different substances may be less fruitful than the
study of why there may be somewhat different sequences, depending
on factors such as availability and social norms. The relative
ease of availability of some substances (e.g., cigarettes, beer,
wine) may well account for their frequent appearance at an early
stage in the sequence of use. However, this may vary among
cultures. In France, for example, wine is widely available and
used both at an early age and at an early stage in the sequence.
In other cultures, where wine is less available but inhalants are
widely available and inexpensive, inhalants are used at an early
age and early in the sequence. Use at a young age may be a
marker, at least in some cultures, for other risk factors, such
as parental substance abuse and other family problems, which can
contribute to later substance abuse problems, independently of
early and frequent use. For example, one study found that,
irrespective of the age of onset of use, individuals who
exhibited numerous behavioral problems in their youth moved on to
problem substance use, no matter how early or late in their youth
they began to use substances (20).<br>
</p>

<p> Limitations in the Research <br>
</p>

<p> Research into stages in the initiation of the use of
different substances has itself evolved through stages. A number
of issues, which have not been thoroughly addressed, remain: </p>

<p> o The identification of stages in the progression from use to
abuse and addiction is more a description of the stages some
individuals move through than a prediction of necessary stages
for most individuals, since the majority of substance users do
not move on to abuse. Reasonable questions are: What prevents
some individuals from progressing from initial use to abuse and
addiction? Are the obstacles primarily due to the absence of
preconditions, such as biological and pharmacological
preconditions or availability and marketing. Studying those
individuals who do not progress from use to addiction may provide
insights and lessons about how to prevent progression among those
who do progress. Of particular importance are studies of the
changing vulnerabilities and resiliencies of individuals in
different developmental stages from childhood through
adolescence, young adulthood, and adulthood. </p>

<p> o What is the role of substance use in progression to abuse
and addiction? The initiation of use of a particular substance
may often not be the most important contributor to the use of a
substance higher in the sequence. Other factors directly related
to use may play a larger role. For example, age of onset,
quantity, frequency, techniques, and purposes of the substance
use may be more salient. Longitudinal risk factor and expectancy
studies have begun to look at the role of these other elements. </p>

<p> o Are some individuals more predisposed to use and abuse
substances than others? Individual biological and psychological
factors may also strongly influence which individuals progress
from use to abuse. </p>

<p> o What environmental factors contribute to substance use and
abuse? Availability, marketing, social norms, peer groups,
subcultures, and settings that encourage substance use may also
be key in determining which individuals progress. </p>

<p> Despite the need for greater understanding about the issues
above, already completed research into stages in substance use
has been influential in providing the basis for policy and
program recommendations. The gateway hypothesis has encouraged
some prevention advocates and program planners to focus on
preventing or delaying the use of gateway substances (e.g.,
alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana) as a possibly effective way to
prevent later use of illicit substances. Longitudinal studies
have found that the use of cigarettes by youth can be a strong
predictor of later problems with substances (17).<br>
</p>

<p> STAGES IN THE CYCLE OF USE, ABUSE, AND ADDICTION <br>
</p>

<p> One approach to the study of stages in substance use focuses
not just on the initiation of use; but also on the continuation
of use, maintenance and progression of use within a class of
substances; progression across classes; and regression,
cessation, and relapse cycles in use and abuse (2).<br>
</p>

<p> Initiation of Use <br>
</p>

<p> Initiation is clearly a key first step in the progression to
more serious levels of use. Because substance use is often
initiated during adolescence, most substance use research has
focused on initiation of use among adolescents. However, most
individuals who initiate substance use do not progress to harmful
use. Also, the factors associated with such progression may often
differ from the factors associated with initiation. Thus, the
focus on the initiation of use during adolescence is not
sufficient for an understanding of the progression from use to
abuse and addiction. <br>
</p>

<p> Continuation of Use <br>
</p>

<p> After trying a substance for the first time, one person may
say, &quot;I won't be trying that again,&quot; while another may
say, &quot;That's for me.&quot; Although only limited research
has been conducted on risk and protective factors associated with
the transition from experimentation to continued use, the
continuation of use can apparently be influenced by the
pharmacology of the substance (e.g., whether it produces desired
or pleasant experiences), the biology of the individual (e.g.,
whether specific individuals have genetic or acquired biological
predispositions or intolerances to the use of specific
substances), the availability and marketing of the substance
(e.g., whether a substance is widely available, used, and
accepted for use), other characteristics of the individual (e.g.,
at what developmental stage one is, and whether one has mental or
emotional problems, which may be ameliorated at least temporarily
by substances), and community contexts (e.g., substance-using
subcultures or settings that strongly encourage and reinforce a
continued use of substances).<br>
</p>

<p> Maintenance and Progression of Use Within a Class of Drugs<br>
</p>

<p> Maintenance and progression may include conformity with norms
of consumption--for example, initial and continued heavy use of
alcohol in a college fraternity. Progressionwith cocaine could
entail movement from snorting to smoking or injection. College
students in some fraternities and sororities with drinking
traditions may be at higher risk for heavy substance use,
especially of alcohol. But very little research has been
conducted on the risk factors for maintenance of high levels of
use or for progression within classes of substances to excessive
use among this age group.<br>
</p>

<p> Progression in Use Across Classes of Substances <br>
</p>

<p> At this stage, an individual may try different substances for
different, and often compensating, effects. For example, the
antiemetic properties of tetrahydracannabinol in cannabis can be
used to facilitate greater use of alcohol, alcohol or marijuana
can be used to smooth out the aftermath of snorting cocaine, and
heroin can be used for similar purposes after a binge with crack.<br>
</p>

<p> Regression, Cessation, and Relapse Cycles <br>
</p>

<p> The transition away from abuse may occur a number of times
before an individual succeeds in getting off a substance or,
failing that, remains dependent. It may also be influenced by the
same factors, or kinds of factors, that contributed to the
substance abuse problem in the first place, including the full
range of biological and pharmacological factors, availability and
marketing, individual emotional needs, or contextual factors.<br>
</p>

<p> STAGES IN PROBLEM BEHAVIORS <br>
</p>

<p> Does substance use itself contribute to conduct disorders,
delinquency, and other problem behaviors? Do these behaviors
then, in turn, contribute to the progression to more use and to
abuse and addiction? </p>

<p> Adolescents who use substances, especially those that are
illegal, are more likely than nonusers to exhibit various problem
behaviors, including: early sexual experimentation, delinquent
activities, eating problems, and psychological or psychiatric
problems, including suicide and suicidal thoughts (10). Less is
known, however, about the sequencing of these behaviors. The
interrelations among the factors is likely to vary widely among
individuals, but some sequences may predominate. Several such
sequences have been proposed. One suggested developmental
sequence, for example, includes six stages: oppositional
(characterized by disobedience at home); offensive (including
disobedience in school, fighting, lying); aggressive (physical
attacks on others, theft at home); minor delinquency (shoplifting
and status offenses, such as alcohol use, truancy, running away);
major delinquency (break-in and entry, car theft, substance
abuse, robbery, drug dealing); and violence (assault, rape,
homicide) (15). </p>

<p> One of the few studies of problem behavior sequences looked
at the order of initiation of four different substances,
delinquency, and sexual activity, among a sample of black
adolescents (3). For males, it found involvement proceeded
generally from beer use to cigarette use, then to delinquency,
sexual activity, marijuana use, and the use of hard liquor. For
females, the progression was generally from cigarette use, to
delinquency, beer use, sexual activity, marijuana, and hard
liquor. For both sexes, delinquency and youthful sexual activity
tended to precede the use of marijuana and hard liquor. </p>

<p> While a high correlation among problem behaviors has been
frequently found, the sequencing of those behaviors is less
clear. The early use of so-called gateway drugs, such as beer and
cigarettes, may contribute to later problem behaviors, while the
later use of marijuana, hard liquor, and other illicit substances
may be more the result of extended participation in problem
behaviors. More research is needed in this area if these
hypotheses are to be better understood and tested.<br>
</p>

<p> KEY ASPECTS OF USE <br>
</p>

<p> Some research has focused on characteristics of substance use
that can strongly influence the progression from use to abuse and
addiction. In addition to the age of first use, these
characteristics include the frequency, quantity, and type of
substance used, and the technologies and purposes and
expectations of use.<br>
</p>

<p> Age of First Use <br>
</p>

<p> Initiation into substance use at a young age is one of the
most striking and often-found predictors of later problems,
including abuse. For example, in one large community epidemiology
study, men who first used substances before age 15 developed
mental and behavioral problems in 51 percent of the cases,
compared with 16 percent among those who began at age 18 or
later. For women, the comparable figures are 39 and 12 percent,
respectively. Other studies have also found problems later on
associated with the earlier introduction to alcohol or other drug
use (19). </p>

<p> This pattern seems to hold specifically for later substance
use and abuse as well. Early use of substances was found to be
associated with later problematic use (7,20). Another study
estimated that, of the men who had initiated the use of marijuana
by the age of 14, 71 percent would be expected to initiate the
use of other illicit substances by age 25, compared with 9
percent of those who first started at age 21 (12). </p>

<p> One report asserted that frequency of use was the mechanism
through which early onset probably operates (12). However,
another study concludes that preexisting conduct problems are a
better predictor of later substance abuse problems than is early
use (19). It found that, in individuals with many conduct
problems, any use of a substance, no matter how late in youth,
was followed by abuse. <br>
</p>

<p> Frequency and Quantity of Substance Used <br>
</p>

<p> When addiction occurs, it usually results from a period of
increasing intensity and frequency of use (5,6). Although
frequency has often been employed as a measure of problematic
use, one study found that quantity of substance used, rather than
frequency of use, was a more powerful predictor of disruptive and
problematic use (21). Quantity and frequency are often related,
but they are not identical. An infrequent user could go on a
binge, where large quantities are consumed, that could be
extremely harmful. By contrast, a frequent user, such as someone
who drinks alcohol every day but in strict moderation, may not
encounter substance-related problems (although a maintenance
alcoholic may drink daily with no apparent intoxication, but with
the later development of associated health problems). The
quantity and frequency of substance use can be strongly affected
by the availability and marketing of the substance and by the
techniques or technologies for administering the drug.<br>
</p>

<p> Type of Substance Used <br>
</p>

<p> The type of substance used can also influence the chances of
later substance problems. More addictive substances--those with
greater abuse liability--will make restraint from continued and
possibly escalating use more difficult. Cigarettes provide an
example experienced by many individuals: nicotine is extremely
addictive, and only a minority of those who try cigarettes and
continue to smoke them will be able to control or easily cut back
on their use.<br>
</p>

<p> Techniques of Use <br>
</p>

<p> Techniques of administration can also influence the
progression of substance use. The introduction of prewrapped,
prepackaged cigarettes, together with widely distributed matches,
was followed by the rapid escalation of cigarette use, and
presumably addiction to nicotine, in the United States in the
late 1800s and early 1900s. Similarly, the introduction of
smokable free-base and crack cocaine, the administration of which
is much more efficient than the snorting of powdered cocaine, led
to an explosion of cocaine abuse and addiction. The Bahamas, for
example, experienced a hundredfold increase in cocaine-related
hospital emergency room admissions following the introduction of
crack and free-base cocaine in the 1980s (8).<br>
</p>

<p> Expectations and Effects of Use <br>
</p>

<p> The expectations and effects of use can also reinforce use
and influence progression from use to abuse and addiction.
Research reviews have discussed some examples of the expectations
and effects of using illicit substances that can reinforce their
use and may increase the likelihood of progression to abuse and
addiction (13,25). These purposes include: </p>

<p> o The reduction of negative feelings, including the use of
stimulants to alleviate depression and weakness; psychedelics to
combat boredom and disillusionment; alcohol to assuage feelings
of guilt, loneliness, and anxiety; and tranquilizers,
amphetamines, and sedatives to reduce painful feelings. </p>

<p> o The reduction of self-rejection. Some researchers have
found an association between substance use and indices of
insecurity, dis-satisfaction with self, desire to change oneself,
defensiveness, low self-esteem, and low self- confidence. </p>

<p> o The increase in potency. Increases in physical and sexual
potency, daring, and toughness can be achieved by using specific
substances in certain situations. This can be especially
appealing to youth, who may be wrestling with feelings of
powerlessness, dissatisfaction, and frustration. </p>

<p> o The expression of anger. Substances can heighten
expressions of anger (e.g., in opposition to mainstream norms) or
can medicate away anger and rage. Narcotics and hypnotics may
help reduce rage, shame, jealousy, and impulses toward extreme
aggressiveness. </p>

<p> o The achievement of peer acceptance. Peers often play the
largest role in endorsing and encouraging substance use, and in
supplying substances. The initiation, continuation, and
progression of use can be important ways for individuals to gain
acceptance into peer groups. This can be true in school (e.g., in
a fraternity), at work (e.g., in a sales force that demands that
one be able to &quot;hold one's liquor&quot;), in substance-using
gangs, and among certain groups of artists (e.g., some
contemporary painters and musicians). </p>

<p> o The seeking of euphoria. Many substance users, especially
addicts, report favorably on drug-induced euphoria. Indeed, the
prospect of euphoria may be the initial attraction of the
substance. It can also encourage continued use, even to the point
of addiction and negative consequences. </p>

<p> o The coping with problems. For some users, substances
temporarily alleviate problems they have been unable to resolve
in other ways. While the problems may be causing emotional pain,
the use of substances, especially for the young, can inhibit the
development of other problem-solving skills and may alleviate
symptoms only in the short-run, since the underlying causes of
the problems are likely to remain unresolved. </p>

<p> o The reduction of overwhelming trauma. Post-traumatic stress
(e.g., after a war, or after physical or sexual abuse) can result
in the use of addictive substances, since use may temporarily
reduce fears, flashbacks, and other negative feelings. </p>

<p> o The suppression of appetite or hunger. Another function of
using some psychoactive substances is appetite suppression. An
extensive literature exists on the use of nicotine, from
cigarette smoking, to control appetite and weight. This
phenomenon often manifests itself in the negative: for example,
current smokers (especially women) are reluctant to stop smoking
for fear they will gain weight (4). </p>

<p> o The seeking of stimulus. Individuals who seek higher levels
of external stimulation can also turn to substances, for a high,
for hallucinations, for unpredictable effects. </p>

<p> o The regulation of affective and behavioral impairments.
Those with mood disorders, such as depression, and behavioral
impairments may find that some substances alter moods and allow
them to modify behaviors. </p>

<p> The above expectations and effects might well be expected to
contribute to more continued and progressively heavier substance
use than would more casual purposes such as curiosity,
experimentation, or recreational use. The more
&quot;serious&quot; the expectations, effects, and functions of
substance use, the greater the likelihood of continued use and
abuse may be. As noted earlier, the use of substances, especially
by the young, to address problems or to achieve feelings may
impede the development of skills for managing feelings and
behaviors and for solving problems, and thus may result in
deficiencies in handling problems in life later on. Indeed, the
use of substances at very young ages may even contribute to
permanent changes in the brain that may contribute to further use
and abuse. More research is needed to clarify the connections
between the expectations and effects of use and the progression
to heavier and more problematic use and abuse.<br>
</p>

<p> SUMMARY <br>
</p>

<p> Substance use, including the progression to heavier and more
harmful use, is a precondition and contributor to abuse and
addiction. Researchers have focused on stages in the progression
of substance use in several ways. They have studied stages in the
initiation of the use of different substances, finding a sequence
that moves from the use of cigarettes and wine or beer, to the
use of marijuana, then hard liquor, and finally other illicit
substances. Because many individuals who use substances do not go
on to substance abuse, and because use at one level does not
guarantee use at a higher level, these stages are descriptive but
not predictive. </p>

<p> In addition to the biologically and pharmacologically
reinforcing properties of addictive substances that can lead to
tolerance and dependence, key aspects of substance use that
contribute to abuse and addiction include age of first use, the
frequency, quantity, and type of substance used, and the
techniques and expectations and effects of use. _ <br>

</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"> </p>

<p> Ethnographic techniques allow researchers to study how
environmental and cultural factors affect values, attitudes, and
behaviors of individuals and groups. Historically, ethnography
has roots in both anthropology and sociology (see box 7-1). </p>

<p> ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDIES OF ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG USE </p>

<p> Since the 1960s the number of drug ethnographies has grown
steadily. Many of the nation's social issues were in one way or
another associated with drug use: poverty, urban unrest among
minorities, counter culture, failure of social programs, AIDS
transmission, and urban violence. Research conducted by
anthropologists and qualitative sociologists was an important
part of understanding new drug-related social problems and
trends. By the mid-1970s, &quot;street ethnography&quot; or
simply &quot;ethnography&quot; were the terms commonly used to
describe the drug research they were conducting in the United
States (60). </p>

<p> Alcohol </p>

<p> Nineteenth century and early twentieth century
anthropologists conducted comprehensive community studies in
nonindustrial societies in which they recorded ritual and social
uses of alcohol. This extensive but generally unfocused
documentation provided data for later cross- cultural analyses
relating alcohol use patterns to other cultural variables. </p>

<p> The contribution of ethnographic studies conducted outside
the United States was to provide data on the social conditioning
of alcohol's effects. The findings from one such study conducted
in </p>

<p> Bolivia during 1958, alerted the alcohol research community
to the existence of culturally accepted alcohol use patterns
quite different from those customarily encountered in the United
States. For example, &quot;virtually all of the Camba (of eastern
Bolivia) drink to the point of passing out, at least twice a
month.&quot; Although the beverage they drink is stronger in
alcoholic concentration than that customarily drunk by other
populations, there appeared to be no major health or social
problems associated with their drinking (35). </p>

<p> These data along with findings from research on four other
societies (the Aritama of Colombia, the Ifaluk of Micronesia, the
Takashima of Japan, and the town of Juxtlahuaca in Oaxaca,
Mexico), support the view that the experiential effect of alcohol
is socially conditioned (37). Each of these societies possessed
distinct messages regarding the use of alcohol, which were clear
and consistent. In contrast, individuals in modern societies are
influenced by overlapping, and sometimes contradictory, social
messages based on religious, ethnic, occupational, generational,
regional, and class differences. Drinking habits and behaviors
within the United States vary enormously. </p>

<p> Since the 1970s, ethnographic research on alcohol use in the
United States has concentrated on specifying and explaining the
variations in American drinking patterns. Some ethnographers have
focused on specific subcultures defined by their problematic
alcohol use (53). Other ethnographers have focused on alcohol
beliefs and behaviors in ethnically, religiously, and
professionally constituted subcultures-- usually exploring the
adaptation of culturally sanctioned drinking patterns, passed on
through family and community modeling, to changing social
contexts (5). </p>

<p> Heroin </p>

<p> The majority of ethnography studies conducted in the 1960s
focused on heroin use. Several of these studies challenged the
accepted perception &quot;that heroin provides an escape for the
user from his psychological problems and from the
responsibilities of social and personal relationships--in short,
an escape from life&quot; (47). Researchers documented drug use
as a way of life, rather than just as an escape from life. Two
such articles, based on three years of field work in Oakland,
California, detailed several distinct patterns or styles among
heroin users. Varying levels of prestige were associated with
these different styles, and heroin users at the top of the
hierarchy were observed to work hard to maintain their lifestyles
(54,55). </p>

<p> Another study in New York City, New York, in the late 1960s,
asked why heroin use periodically mushroomed, in epidemic
proportions, in lower class communities. The data revealed that,
regardless of ethnic background, in poor neighborhoods
&quot;there are pressures on adolescent boys to live up to the
ideals of toughness, strength, daring, and the willingness to
challenge the bleak fate of being poor.&quot; Simply put,
&quot;movement into heroin use was one route to becoming a
`somebody' in the eyes of the important people who comprised the
slum social network&quot; (20). Later articles elaborated on the
idea of so-called street status. Based on 4 years of research, a
hierarchy of illicit drugs was defined by perceived risk
components, such as physical harm, addiction potential, parental
discovery, police, and intragroup dangers. The use of drugs
perceived by the group to be risky, increased a user's personal
status within that group. The researcher concluded that reliance
on legal sanctions and scare tactics to reduce the use of certain
drugs will only make the use of these drugs appear more daring
and hence to some, more attractive (21,23). </p>

<p> Cocaine and Crack </p>

<p> Although ethnographers noted that cocaine use was on the rise
among some middle-class professionals and drug experimenters by
the mid 1970s, it was not until the 1980s that extensive studies
on cocaine users were begun. </p>

<p> While some of these early users, many of whom were white,
progressed from experimental use of cocaine to heavy use with
subsequent biological and behavioral problems, many others did
not (57,58). Several years later, though, middle- class users
with cocaine-related problems were becoming more common,
prompting many would-be experimenters to steer clear of the drug.
During this same time period, cocaine smuggling escalated,
resulting in increased availability, lower prices, and higher
quality. Within low-income, minority communities, cocaine
smoking, first as free-base and then as crack, grew so
precipitously that it was commonly called an epidemic. In New
York City, ethnographers provided complementary perspectives on
the rapidly changing crack culture. </p>

<p> In a series of ethno-historical articles, Ansley Hamid
documented the history of cocaine smoking as it evolved in lower
income minority neighborhoods in New York City. Among the
elements identified as central to the widespread diffusion of
crack smoking was the interest shown by heroin injectors with
collapsed veins in the concentrated high of smoked cocaine; the
entry of Rastafarian marijuana distributors into the cocaine
trade; the emergence of young, nonusing street distributors able
to sell unit doses in vials at relatively low prices; and the
rise in crack prices due to increased demand combined with
suppliers who had greater control over the market. Hamid believes
the rise and fall of cocaine smoking to have followed a
developmental cycle similar to that of heroin use between 1964
and 1972 and marijuana use in the 1960s and 1970s (31,32,33,34). </p>

<p> A 1992 study of crack use focused on the children of crack
users. It found that the extended family networks in the African
American community, a major source of stability and support, were
being overwhelmed by the drug crisis as the number of children
whose mothers were no longer able to care for them because of
increased drug use. Further, children exposed to drug-taking
behavior by adults may be more likely to display similar
behavior. In one family headed by a 60- year-old woman, an adult
son was a crack dealer and a daughter was a crack-abusing
prostitute (18). </p>

<p> Hallucinogens </p>

<p> Most ethnographic studies of hallucinogens and mind-altering
drugs (e.g., peyote, mescaline, mushrooms) have focused on tribal
societies. Anthropologists have uniformly found that the use of
hallucinogens was socially approved and integrated into the
religious and social life of the community. If one defines abuse
as use of a drug in such a way that it interferes with physical,
economic, or social functions, then little if any evidence points
to drug abuse among tribally organized peoples (1,27,15,42). </p>

<p> Other than scattered studies of hallucinogenic drug use among
hippies (12,14,45,46), few ethnographic studies have been
completed on use of hallucinogenic substances in American
society. However, the persistent use of lysergic acid
diethylamide (LSD) by some young people, and concerns that its
use may be increasing, have sparked new interest among
ethnographers (30,38). </p>

<p> Marijuana </p>

<p> As with hallucinogens, most of the ethnographic research on
marijuana use has been conducted outside the United States. Much
of it was initiated in the 1960s and 1970s, when increasing use
of marijuana among American youth led researchers to question the
social and medical consequences of marijuana use, especially
long-term use. Research was conducted in countries in which
marijuana use was long standing and widespread, such as Brazil,
Colombia, Costa Rica, Egypt, Jamaica, Mexico, Rwanda, and South
Africa (11,16,17, 51). </p>

<p> In Jamaica, for example, anthropologists Vera Rubin and
Lambros Comitas directed a research team of 45 social scientists
and medical professionals to conduct original ethnographic
research at several field sites, in addition to medical,
psychological, and psychiatric testing in hospitals and clinics.
Their controversial findings were that none of the deleterious
social or medical consequences believed by many to be associated
with the drug in the United States could be found among Jamaican
users: </p>

<p> .?.?. There is no evidence of any causal relationship between
cannabis use and mental deterioration, insanity, violence or
poverty; or that widespread cannabis use in Jamaica produces an
apathetic, indolent class of people. In fact, the ganja complex
provides an adaptive mechanism by which many Jamaicans cope with
limited life chances in a harsh environment (52). </p>

<p> Other than a few studies of middle-class users (10,39) and
young African American dealers (24,25), substantial U.S.
ethnographic research on marijuana use in the United States has
been generally lacking, despite the fact that marijuana has been
the most commonly used illicit substance for decades. </p>

<p> Phencyclidine (PCP) </p>

<p> An ethnographic study in 1979 of PCP users is frequently
cited for its substantive findings and methodological
contribution as the first multisite ethnographic drug study.
Initiating the study when PCP use was believed to be spreading
among white working-class and middle-class young people, the
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) contracted for a
four-city ethnographic study of PCP users not in treatment. After
3 months of working in Miami, Florida, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, Chicago, Illinois, and Seattle, Washington,
ethnographers documented groups of users and the underlying
social processes. They found that it was relatively rare for a
young person to use PCP exclusively. Use occurred mainly within
socially distinctive groups of young people who displayed &quot;a
kind of restlessness, an orientation for action, and a sense that
life generally was boring, uninteresting, and lacked recreational
activities&quot; (22). </p>

<p> The young people studied were very knowledgeable about drug
effects and understood that the PCP drug experience varied
dramatically with dosage. Low doses of the drug were reported by
different user groups to be mildly euphoric and hallucinogenic
like LSD, or sedating like barbiturates. What concerned regular
PCP users was not the acute adverse effects reported in the media
(e.g., psychotic episodes, assaultive outburst, irreparable
harm), but rather &quot;burning out&quot;--a &quot;spacey&quot;
state accompanied by incoherent thoughts, forgetfulness, and
memory loss. As burnout became apparent, individual users and
groups of users consciously cut back their PCP use. Within this
group, violent episodes were found to be rare, mainly involving
efforts by law enforcement or hospital treatment staff to
restrain users, thereby seeming to set off panic reactions and
struggle. </p>

<p> The study suggested that a significant gap existed between
official agencies responsible for drug education and prevention
and street drug users. When PCP use increased dramatically in the
mid 1970s, there were no official responses because quantitative
national data sources, such as surveys of high school students
and hospital emergency reports, failed to include PCP as a
separate drug. When the official agencies recognized the
widespread use of PCP, their prevention efforts were viewed by
users as distorted and were discounted. Ethnographers attribute
the eventual decline in PCP use to &quot;the general consensus
among users themselves on the negative features of its long-term
effects rather than the kind of expert opinion that accompanies
legitimate efforts at prevention&quot; (22). </p>

<p> SOCIAL CONTEXT OF DRUG USE </p>

<p> Specificity in Drug Abuse Research </p>

<p> As more questions are asked about alcohol and other drug use,
it becomes clear that drug use is not one phenomenon, but many.
There is no generic pattern of drug use; rather, there is use of
specific drugs in specific situations. </p>

<p> Quantitative researchers frequently use ethnic categories to
increase study specificity. While studies on different ethnic
groups are useful, often the definitions of ethnicity vary and
the concept is employed uncritically. Moreover, most of the
quantitative researchers using the concept of ethnicity
implicitly assume what anthropologists call a &quot;static&quot;
concept of culture, viewing ethnicity as a trait one is born
with, an unchanging characteristic, like hair color or body type.
In contrast, most ethnographers view culture as &quot;a dynamic
process through which individuals and societies learn the sum
total of their society's behaviors and associated belief systems,
including those encompassing drug use practices and beliefs&quot;
(4). </p>

<p> Many recent ethnographic studies focus on socially meaningful
units in which members share social statuses, behaviors, and
attitudes. For example, a recent book on drug use among Hispanics
included ethnographic accounts of Cuban so-called streetside drug
use in Miami, Florida, drug use among male and female gang
members from the East Los Angeles, California, barrios, and drug
use and dealing among low-income Puerto Ricans in New York City,
New York, and Chicago, Illinois. (28). </p>

<p> Inclusiveness in Drug Abuse Research </p>

<p> One drawback of studying increasingly specific drug-using
communities is losing sight of the larger whole. Ethnographic
drug studies at times fail to link the customs of the specific
study communities to customs in other communities or to place the
customs in a larger framework. A way that both highlights and
critiques the contribution of ethnography in the field of drug
research is to focus on the social relationships around drug use,
specifically, on the pattern of use in relation to
self-identification with a social group. In the ethnographic
literature, four basic patterns appear: </p>

<p> o Individuals who use drugs with others who share an
identification with a lifestyle or subculture in which drug use
is the central component. </p>

<p> o Individuals who use drugs with others who share an
identification with a lifestyle or subculture in which drug use
is customary and openly accepted, but not the central component. </p>

<p> o Individuals who use drugs with friends and acquaintances,
but there is no self-identification with a drug-using lifestyle
or subculture. </p>

<p> o Individuals who use drugs by themselves while maintaining
self-identification with a group that stigmatizes drug use (see
table 7-1). </p>

<p> Drug Use Within a Drug Subculture </p>

<p> Numerous studies have documented that, for pragmatic and
social reasons, individuals whose lives have become oriented to a
drug often associate with others who use the drug in a similar
fashion. Over time a subculture develops with specialized
knowledge, norms, and expectations. Individuals think of
themselves as belonging to the subculture, and others define them
as such. &quot;Where subcultures exist, social-psychological
barriers separate participants from onlookers&quot; (13). It has
often been noted, for example, that for many heroin users, use of
the drug overrode background characteristics, such as race,
class, and national origin, to become the defining
characteristic. As one heroin user related: </p>

<p> I always refer to myself as a junkie, even when I'm not
hooked on anything. And when you're introduced to somebody for
the first time the first thing you find out is whether he's a
junkie or not. It's like belonging to some fantastic lodge, you
know, but the initiation ceremony is a lot rougher (57). </p>

<p> However, even within a drug-using subculture variations
exist, especially with regard to frequency and amount of use.
This difference was emphasized by a 38-year-old regular heroin
user from New York City: </p>

<p> .?.?. all heroin addicts are not heroin abusers, okay? And
you get the abuser, he's a dog, right? He's the one who sits in
the drug house and shoots all day long. That's an abuser. I'm a
visitor, you never catch me in the drug house. Not me, no (41). </p>

<p> A similar distinction was made by a female crack user, who,
although her life revolved around crack, was still attractive,
healthy, in a relationship, and the social center of a network of
users. In contrast, for her: </p>

<p> The crack addict is the person who's lost all sense of what's
going on. They are like zombies. They are out there standing in
the pouring rain. If it's cold and snowing, they'll be walking up
and down out there .?.?.?. They are .?.?. to the point of
desperation where they will take off [rob] people they know. They
will set you up. It comes to the point where they will set up
family, friends, anybody--the point where they don't care anymore
(61). </p>

<p> One ethnographer noted that these types of individuals were
attempting &quot;to become `visitors' in social networks of other
users, to establish a degree of contact and membership while
remaining somewhat detached from the network. Their attempts to
remain partially marginal to both street and straight society are
a central part of their strategies for controlling their use and
their own lives&quot; (41). </p>

<p> Drug Use as Part of a Lifestyle or Identity </p>

<p> Drug use often occurs within a lifestyle or subculture
inwhich drug use is common and accepted, but is not the defining
characteristic. The subculture may be professionally oriented.
For example, some of the earliest drug research was done among
jazz musicians (2,62). Anabolic steroid use was common among
professional and amateur athletes in certain sports (29). During
its peak, cocaine use was rampant among entertainers. </p>

<p> In one study, a waitress at a rock-and-roll bar called
cocaine use an &quot;occupational hazard.&quot; She and other
restaurant workers in the study described how groups of workers
would pool funds to purchase small amounts of cocaine for use
while working: &quot;For them. ?.?. hard work, constant activity,
and long, late hours seemed instrumental to their cocaine
use&quot; (59). </p>

<p> Recent research has documented that at times the nuclear or
extended family may act as the subcultural unit in which illicit
drug use is common and accepted. </p>

<p> We was with my mother over her girlfriend's house when Aunt
Jeannie came by and she had some coke. She cooked it up and told
Ma and Ruth to try it. After that things started goin' crazier. I
had to take care of my oldest sister's two sons, my son, and my
younger brother. I had to do everything. Most of the time we
didn't have nothin' to eat. We stayed hungry all the time. When I
washed clothes I'd find vials in her [mother's] pockets.. ?.?. I
`member comin' home one day and she'd been smokin' for awhile
then, but the house was full of people smokin' all over the
place. I went to go to my bedroom and close the door and it was
full too. I said to her, `what's happenin'? I just turned round
and left. I was tired, the house was dirty with vials on the
floor and the tables and I'd just had my son.. ?.?. I just wanted
to get away.. ?.?. At first I had smoked some crack to kill my
appetite, to keep me from bein' hungry. ?.?. I just felt like I
couldn't take it no more so I took my son to my sister and left </p>

<p> .?.?. I went on a binge and smoked for three months. Nobody
knew where I was, but I was out smoking crack and gettin' money
anyway I could get it (18). </p>

<p> Drug Use With Partners and Peers </p>

<p> Drug use can also occur when there is no subcultural support
or membership in a group that approves of drug use. In some
cases, an orientation toward, or acceptance of, drug use may have
been acquired earlier in life when the individual was part of a
drug-accepting subculture: former hippies, student drug users, or
participants in street life. Such individuals may continue their
drug use long after ending their other associations with the
subcultures. </p>

<p> Recently reported by ethnographers is the recreational use of
MDMA (Ecstasy) by some middle-class individuals. </p>

<p> Some professionals, particularly those whose ideas about
drugs were formulated during the 1960s, quietly view psychoactive
substances as one of many ways to relax, to relate, to &quot;kick
back.&quot; It is within this context, coupled with the need to
relax fast and relate quickly, that Ecstasy is used (50). </p>

<p> Drug Use in Social Isolation </p>

<p> Last, some individuals use illicit drugs primarily by
themselves. Often they identify themselves with a professional
subculture or social group that is opposed to drug use. One
well-documented pattern is that of physicians, nurses, and other
health workers who illicitly use psychoactive pharmaceutical
drugs, especially narcotics (63,64). </p>

<p> Other patterns of use in social isolation are known but
poorly documented in the ethnographic literature. Unsupervised
use of pharmaceutical drugs is fairly common and often the line
between licitly obtained and illicitly obtained drugs can be
blurred. Emergency room and family physicians, for example,
encounter suspected middle-class prescription drug abusers. One
middle-class housewife interviewed as part of a study of
emergency room drug episodes began her use of prescription pain
killers because of a back problem, and then continued chronic
(and essentially unsupervised) use of the drug for years by
obtaining prescriptions from multiple physicians (49). </p>

<p> Typology as a Whole </p>

<p> The ethnographic method of describing how and, to some
extent, why people use drugs differs from the purely quantitative
method that analyzes the association of drug use with the social
and demographic characteristics of the users. </p>

<p> To date, most of the ethnographic research has concentrated
on drug-focused subcultures or on crime-related subcultures.
There are few studies on other populations, and many of these are
now dated. For example, there have been no significant
ethnographic studies of student drug use in almost two decades.
The drug problem has been defined in the public mind and among
some funding sources as a problem of poor minority communities.
Some ethnographers acknowledge that, to some extent, their own
attitudes have contributed to the skewing of the drug research as
well. Ethnographic field work with drug-focused and criminal
subcultures is considered by some to be more adventurous and
professionally rewarding. Also, in its own way, it may be easier
than field work in the general population, since study
participants can be readily delineated from onlookers and
subjects can be relatively easily located on the street or
through their relationship with treatment and law enforcement
agencies. </p>

<p> One consequence of the absence of information concerning drug
use within the general population is that, like a self-
fulfilling prophecy, attention continues to be paid almost
exclusively to minority drug use. Drug use and drug users are
defined as the &quot;other,&quot; different from the rest of
society. Ethnographers have paid relatively little attention to
the relationship between culturally approved drug use (e.g.,
caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, psychoactive prescription drugs) and
illicit drug use. </p>

<p> Another consequence is that there are few data available on
which to base prevention programs for individuals who are
unlikely to become members of a drug or criminal subculture.
Virtually nothing is known about experimenters, casual users,
controlled users, or chronic users not associated with a drug
subculture. </p>

<p> POVERTY, RACISM, AND CYCLE OF ABUSE </p>

<p> The preceding section outlined a variety of drug using
contexts in the United States and documented the presence of drug
use and abuse among different social, racial, and ethnic classes.
Equally important, however, is the realization that the
consequences of drug abuse are especially devastating in
chronically poor, often minority, communities. While poverty as
an individual risk factor for substance abuse is described in
chapter 6, this section considers ethnographic observations on
the links between the poverty of the inner-city communities and
substance abuse. </p>

<p> The Social Context of Poverty </p>

<p> Drug ethnographers have noted that urban poverty means more
than lacking money. Often it means living in substandard housing
in communities that lack basic municipal services, and for young
people it usually means attending overcrowded, underfunded,
demoralized schools. Researchers regard illicit drug use,
especially the use of heroin, cocaine, and crack, as both a
result of oppressive social conditions and a cause of the
worsening of these conditions. </p>

<p> To cope with difficult social circumstances, ethnographers
have documented the effective utilization of extended family
networks and kin relationships. However, even with these
safeguards, it is not uncommon for children to encounter
alcoholism, other drug use, depression, physical abuse and
neglect, sexual abuse, and other traumatic experiences. </p>

<p> Lack of Opportunity </p>

<p> In ethnographic life histories of men and women who become
deeply involved with illicit drugs, the characteristic of
inner-city life most often mentioned is the lack of opportunity
for meaningful work. For example, an ethnographer studying heroin
addicts in the early 1970s noted: </p>

<p> Often in interviews with addicts I have thought that this
antiwork attitude was a sour-grapes defense because so few have
had meaningful work experiences and many do not consider
good-paying or creative jobs work, but I think that these
attitudes are more than psychological mechanisms. They are, I
believe, deeper in the fabric of our society and arise out of
poverty and the reality of poor, uneducated persons who can only
expect the most dull, stultifying, and meaningless work. Most, I
would expect, held these attitudes before their addiction and
when they became addicted simply added another good reason not to
pursue something that offered so little (56). </p>

<p> More recently, ethnographers studying the crack subculture,
have related changes in drug use patterns to structural changes
in the world economy. For many inner-city residents the difficult
economic situation of the 1950s and 1960s became impossible in
the 1970s and 1980s, as many of the secure semiskilled and
unskilled jobs shifted overseas. New York City, for example, lost
a half million manufacturing jobs and 100,000 jobs in wholesale
and retail trade between 1967 and 1987 (36). For individuals
without post secondary degrees, jobs that could support a family
became scarce. </p>

<p> Because of the structural shifts, basic expectations around
work have changed dramatically: </p>

<p> The option of a steady, legal job appears so distant for
inner-city high-school dropouts (and even graduates), that they
cease job searches after a few attempts or experiences in
low-wage jobs. Adult household members can rarely provide
concrete assistance in finding jobs or help in accessing networks
of employers (19). </p>

<p> Racism </p>

<p> Clearly a person need not be a member of a racial or ethnic
minority group to use drugs. Much of the early ethnographic
research was done on white heroin-using individuals (20,21,48) or
with mixed ethnic and racial backgrounds samples (47, 20,56).
Nonetheless, many ethnographers introduce race as an explanatory
element. It is not used in the genetic or biological sense but
rather that racial discrimination has shaped the social context
and opportunity structure for many people of color. Ethnographers
cite the indirect racism of some politicians who have been
unresponsive to the worsening social conditions of schools,
housing, and municipal services in many minority communities.
Also reported is the active racism encountered by many minority
people in daily life (9,8). </p>

<p> Ethnographers describe inner-city minority residents as
having a pervasive sense of not fitting into white mainstream
society. Within most poor inner-city communities, whites are
rarely encountered except as representatives of conventional
institutions such as police, teachers, and social workers. </p>

<p> Development of an Oppositional Culture </p>

<p> While oppressive social conditions, limited economic
opportunities, and racism are identified by ethnographers as
contributing to the high prevalence of drug abuse in the inner
city, in and of themselves they offer little insight into the
specific attitudes and behaviors of those involved in illicit
drug use. For this, ethnographers have often relied on the notion
of an oppositional culture, one of resistance or refusal. </p>

<p> Some ethnographers argue that amidst oppression and
exclusion, minorities, such as blacks, Hispanics, and American
Indians, develop &quot;a collective identity or sense of
peoplehood in opposition to the social identity of white
Americans.&quot; Developed in tandem with this oppositional
social identity is a cultural frame of reference that defines
&quot;certain forms of behavior and certain activities or events,
symbols, and meanings&quot; as not appropriate because they are
characteristic of white Americans while &quot;other forms of
behaviors and other events, symbols, and meanings [are defined]
as more appropriate because they are not a part of white
Americans way of life. To behave in the manner defined as falling
within a white cultural frame of reference is to `act white' and
is negatively sanctioned&quot; (26). </p>

<p> Many ethnographers studying inner-city communities argue that
illicit drug use is embedded in an oppositional culture, formed
in response to oppressive social conditions and lack of
opportunity. Ethnographer Terry Williams explains: </p>

<p> .?.?.?to some extent, it is possible to see the violence,
crime, and substance abuse that plague the inner city as
manifestations of resistance to a society perceived as white,
racist, and economically exclusive. This could be called a
culture of refusal. The young people in the crackhouses refuse to
be part of the system, refuse to obey their parents, reject
school or any adult-controlled education or training, spurn
prevailing social values and most authority. In the crackhouses,
teenagers and adults refuse to obey the law, refuse to stay
sober, refuse to engage in safe sexual practices--even though
this refusal leads them to behaviors that are manifestly harmful
both physiologically and psychologically (61). </p>

<p> Cycle of Abuse </p>

<p> Attraction of the Drug </p>

<p> Ethnographers have emphasized three factors to help explain
the use of illicit drugs, especially heroin and crack by poor,
inner-city, and minority populations. </p>

<p> First, ethnographers report that as the use of a drug begins
to spread through a community, its use is seen as a status symbol
within the street hierarchy. Many ethnographers attributed the
quick expansion of cocaine smoking that occurred in the middle
1980s to cocaine's reputation as a high-status drug, especially
when smoked or free based (23). </p>

<p> Second, initiation into drug use almost always occurred
through an established friendship or kin relationship. Virtually
every ethnographic study of drug use quotes users as saying: I
was at a party (or with a friend) and someone offered me some
heroin (cocaine, crack), so I tried it. </p>

<p> The third theme is simply that many people, when they try
heroin or crack cocaine, like it. For some individuals, at least
in the beginning, their drug experiences are more highly valued
than anything else in their lives (6,61). </p>

<p> Several ethnographers have suggested that once crack became
available at relatively low cost in the late 1980s, the sharp
rise in its use was due primarily to the intensity of the drug
experience, comparable in somatic effect to arterial injection.
The drug's effects attracted intravenous drug users with
collapsed veins or with concerns about HIV transmission, as well
as many nonintravenous drug users (23,40,43). </p>

<p> Slide Into Abuse </p>

<p> In explaining the slide of inner-city residents into drug
abuse, addiction, and dependency, ethnographers have highlighted
two complementary themes. One theme explains the function drug
dependency serves in simplifying and giving meaning to a drug
user's life. Stated succinctly: &quot;The euphoria of heroin and
the excitement of hustling serve many addicts in the same way
that jobs, sex, and consumption serve nonaddicts&quot; (56). </p>

<p> A similar conclusion was drawn by another ethnographer
studying crack use patterns: </p>

<p> Substance abuse in general, and crack in particular, offer
the equivalent of a millenarian metamorphosis. Instantaneously
users are transformed from being unemployed, depressed high
school drop-outs, despised by the world--and secretly convinced
that their failure is due to their own inherent stupidity,
&quot;racial laziness&quot; and disorganization-- into being a
mass of heart palpitating pleasure, followed only minutes later
by a jaw-gnashing crash and wide awake alertness that provides
their life with concrete purpose: get more crack--fast! (8). </p>

<p> The complementary perspective emphasizes the lack of a viable
lifestyle alternative to drug use. One researcher contends that
due to the unequal distribution of viable nonaddict social roles
in society, some groups will have more difficulty in recovery
than others: </p>

<p> For example, a white, middle-class, high-school-educated,
male addict will have more personal and social resources to draw
from when he decides to give up drugs than will a Chicano addict
living in a barrio. In fact, a relatively uneducated Chicano
addict may opt to retain the junkie- dealer role and identity
because it provides him with greater status and financial rewards
than any other social role available to him (7). </p>

<p> End of the Cycle </p>

<p> Despite little improvement in the social conditions of many
inner cities, recent journalistic accounts, ethnographic studies,
and reports from surveillance systems indicate that the
prevalence of crack use may be decreasing. Ethnographers report
that for many individuals, the initial appeal of crack use has
faded. &quot;Youths under 16 have made a new pastime of
ridiculing or beating up crackheads who they say disgrace
neighborhoods or are nuisances or thieves. Five years ago,
youngsters their age had initiated crack use after first becoming
distributors, as youngsters had previously been drawn into heroin
use&quot; (34). </p>

<p> Ethnographers present several possible explanations for this
downturn. Epidemiologically, a parallel could be drawn to the
decrease seen in bacteria-based epidemics, where all individuals
most likely to be infected have been. Economically, it could be
argued that all possible wealth to be extracted from the inner
city has been. There are simply fewer resources for drug
traffickers, smugglers, and importers. </p>

<p> A complementary explanation is based on concepts put forward
25 years ago (3). It was argued that the social consequences
resulting from a drug's use could be related to the historical
stage of the drug's introduction in society. Most importantly,
over time, a subculture of drug users develops &quot;.?.?.
material on how to obtain and ingest the drug, definitions of the
typical effects, the typical course of the experience, and the
permanence of the effects.. ?.?.&quot; In the case of marijuana
and LSD, this type of shared information may have accounted for
the sharp decrease in reported psychotic reactions even though
the actual number of users was increasing. </p>

<p> This subculture can also define certain drugs or styles of
use as dangerous. For example, ethnographers argue that the
downturn in cocaine use in the late 1980s among middle- and
working-class individuals was due to the belief that
&quot;cocaine can mess you up,&quot; and that this subculture of
users understood this warning as more than just propaganda of
prevention proponents (59). </p>

<p> This same process may be occurring in inner-city communities
among the subculture of crack users. Researchers note that the
crack epidemic has followed a predictable developmental cycle,
previously seen with heroin use, &quot;characterized by periods
of onset, incubation, widespread diffusion, peak, and decline.
The final stage is stabilization at reduced levels of use&quot;
(34). </p>

<p> In exploring the devastation caused by crack epidemics on
inner-city communities, ethnographers have called attentionto the
process through which harm-reducing information develops within a
subculture of users. For example, among middle-class,
cocaine-using individuals, many users gained information from
conventional sources (such as books, magazines, and even
scholarly journals) on the progression of cocaine dependence,
long-term negative consequences, danger signals, and methods to
control or end use. This information then spread through the
wider user community. In contrast, researchers note that the
inner-city subculture of crack users paid little attention to
conventional information sources and were ideologically
predisposed to discount what information did reach them. While
there was no deficit of warnings about the dangers of crack use
in the popular media, ethnographers observed that little effort
was made to translate prevention information into more
appropriate media messages for inner-city communities. </p>

<p> FUTURE RESEARCH </p>

<p> Over the past 30 years, ethnographers have contributed to the
understanding of substance abuse research through their work
among different countries and among different subpopulations in
the United States. However, some additional contributions could
be made in the following areas. </p>

<p> Filling in the Gaps </p>

<p> The earlier sections on the social contexts of drug use
emphasized that drug use in the United States is much more than
heroin and cocaine in the inner cities and LSD in the suburbs.
Research is needed, for example, on middle-class prescription
abusers, substance abusers in rural areas, and hidden populations
(e.g., homeless, runaways, dropouts); since many of these
individuals are either excluded from, or under sampled in, the
national drug abuse surveys. To further complete the matrix of
substance use and abuse in the United States, future research
could address not only those individuals whose use is
unmanageable, but individuals and communities who do not use, or
whose use is moderate and controlled. </p>

<p> Expanding Research Hypotheses </p>

<p> The documentation that cultural and societal norms, to a
large degree, shape individuals' and groups' behaviors toward
drugs use, could be used to formulate new substance abuse
research hypotheses, or expand on existing hypotheses. For
example, understanding the etiology of drug use through studies
of children will help explain initiation of drug use and provide
guidance for prevention efforts. Basic studies that document how
children come to perceive drugs are lacking. &quot;...when it
happens, how it happens. How they conceptualize, for example,
what is a drug and what is a poison, and how that changes when
they begin experimenting with drugs&quot; (44). </p>

<p> Planning Prevention Programs </p>

<p> The insight gained by ethnographic research on a community's
or subculture's view on substance use could be incorporated to a
greater degree in the needs assessment, planning, implementation,
monitoring, and evaluation components of substance abuse
prevention research. The information gained from ethnographic
research could help assure that the prevention information is
culturally appropriate not just in a generic ethnic sense, but in
terms of the specific cognitive framework and concerns of the
target audience. Additionally, the qualitative tools used in
ethnography can assist quantitative researchers in the
interpretation of substance abuse data in varying contexts. </p>

<p> Identifying Emergent Trends </p>

<p> Ethnographic research is also useful in its ability to
relatively quickly document changes in existing drug use patterns
or identify the use of new drugs by a particular subculture. This
timely information could assist in the planning of appropriate
prevention strategies. </p>

<p> SUMMARY </p>

<p> Studies on drug-using subcultures have provided a wealth of
knowledge on why, how, and who uses and abuses drugs.
Experience-based methods of data collection, such as ethnography,
provide the field of substance abuse research with unique
information on drug abuse among individuals, groups, and
communities. Some of the contributions discussed in this chapter
have been theoretical, substantive, and programmatic. </p>

<p> Ethnographic studies have documented drug use patterns
worldwide and in so doing have assisted the understanding of
societal influences on drug use. These insights have, for
example, been utilized in the planning, implementation, and to
some extent, evaluation of drug prevention programs in a variety
of different social contexts. </p>

<p> Researchers have also utilized ethnographies to follow
constantly changing drug use patterns. Moreover, ethnographers
provide valuable data on new drug use such as who is using it,
how the drug is being used, and where the probable epicenters of
the drug use are. </p>

<p> While not without methodological limitations, ethnography and
other experience-based research provide new insights into
substance abuse, as well as complimenting more quantitative
methods of data collection. </p>

<p> BOX 7-1: What is Ethnography? Ethnographic research is
descriptive, subjective, analytical, and comparative. The focus
on context is central to the ethnographic approach, explaining
how a particular behavior, institution, or process is acted on by
larger forces outside of the control of the participants. It
describes how events happen and the social life of the study
individuals. While qualitative interviewing and other more formal
methodologies are usually part of an ethnographic study,
participant observation (i.e., informally interacting with
participants and observing events as they naturally occur) is a
hallmark of ethnographic research. Studies are subjective in that
they focus on the understandings, interpretations, and world
views of the participants. Ethnographic accounts describe not
only what occurs, but also the multiple levels of distinctions by
which individuals and groups make sense of and purposively act in
the world. Ethnographic studies are also analytical. The
observations, interviews, and documents are raw data, as forms
and responses are raw data for survey statisticians. The
ethnographer's analytic responsibility is to condense and order
these data. The analytic work can include the identification of
nonobvious patterns, associations, and themes, as well as the
construction of typologies, process models, or explanatory
frameworks. Finally, ethnographic research is comparative in two
senses of the term. First, it often explores how attitudes and
behaviors are shaped by social forces in two or more contexts.
The contexts are at times spatial (two different cultures or
subcultures), at other times temporal (the same culture or
subculture at different times). Ethnographic studies are also
conducted within a research tradition, so that each new project
draws on the methods and findings of previous research. Over
time, a corpus of work develops regarding a particular cultural
community (e.g., Samoans, inner-city drug users) or a particular
topic (e.g.,witchcraft, ethnic boundaries). As new work appears
it is scrutinized for fit with the existing corpus. Lack of fit

<p> <b>TECHNOLOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE
ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> <b>US Government Office of Technology Assessment</b> </p>

<p> October 18, 1994 </p>

<p> <b>CHAPTER 9 POLICY OPTIONS </b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> Issues related to substance abuse and addiction have long
occupied the attention of the American public. Congress has:
authorized a multitude of federal programs aimed at reducing or
preventing the supply and demand of illicit drugs and to regulate
the availability of illicit substances, appropriated billions of
dollars each year to federal agencies, provided oversight of
federal programs, and passed broad-based legislation to
coordinate programs as part of the war on drugs. </p>

<p> Congress faces several fundamental difficulties in addressing
the causes of substance abuse and addiction: </p>

<p> o No scientific consensus exists as to what is the driving
cause of substance abuse and addiction. A range of risk and
protective factors have been associated with drug use, abuse, and
addiction. </p>

<p> o Federal antidrug efforts, though coordinated by the White
House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), are spread
among many federal agencies, whose authorization and
appropriations are the subject of action by numerous
congressional committees and subcommittees. ONDCP efforts in drug
demand reduction efforts alone involved the efforts of federal
agencies across at least 11 Cabinet-level departments. This makes
coordinated legislative action difficult to achieve. </p>

<p> o The federal budget deficit is an obstacle to the creation
of new domestic programs that target known risk and protective
factors in individuals and communities. The framework and
literature reviews presented in this report make clear that
multiple factors in individuals, groups, and substance abuse and
addiction can arise and be influenced by communities. Thus,
effective intervention requires prevention practitioners to
select from a variety of options, so they can target the specific
factors that are especially important for the particular
populations and communities they are addressing. This does not
mean that everything must be done at once nor that everything be
known in advance of taking action. To the contrary, policymakers
and practitioners can take small steps at a time, and then, as
resources and new knowledge permit, take additional steps that
address a fuller range of factors and contexts in greater depth. </p>

<p> o Current drug prevention programs lack scientifically
accepted standards for determining their success or failure.
While federal supply-side efforts yield hard data (e.g., amount
of illicit drugs confiscated, number of persons incarcerated), it
is much more difficult to demonstrate and quantify the impact of
a domestic program designed, in part or in whole, to prevent drug
abuse. Whatever methods are developed, tested, and incorporated
into prevention programs, a critical component of success is
careful, rigorous evaluation. Answering &quot;what works?&quot;
is essential in making advances in preventing substance abuse. </p>

<p> This chapter addresses some of the policy issues brought to
the Office of Technology Assessment's (OTA's) attention during
the course of this assessment, and possible options for
congressional action. The issues and options are broken into four
broad categories: federal focus and prevention program structure,
research needs, community activity settings, and availability.
Given the broad nature of federal antidrug efforts, many
important issues relating to federal antidrug efforts remain
beyond the scope of this report. Such topics include drug
treatment, interdiction and enforcement, and drug legalization. </p>

<p> The order in which the issues and options are presented does
not imply priority. Moreover, the options presented under each
policy question are intended as a short menu from which Congress
can choose one or more options for consideration and
implementation, and they are not necessarily mutually exclusive. </p>

<p> FEDERAL FOCUS AND PREVENTION PROGRAM STRUCTURE </p>

<p> Supply vs. Demand Reduction </p>

<p> The federal substance abuse control policy has as its primary
focus the eradication of the supply of drugs. The federal
government currently spends over $12 billion annually on antidrug
efforts, with approximately two-thirds of this amount supporting
drug interdiction and law enforcement activities, and the
remainder supporting demand- side activities, such as drug
treatment, research, and prevention programs. While ONDCP's most
recent National Drug Control Strategy argued for a slightly
increased percentage of funds for demand-side reduction, the
larger percentage of funds remain devoted to supply-side efforts.
Congress could decide that existing levels of effort and program
approaches in interdiction may need to be continued for a longer
period of time before they can succeed in reducing the
production, distribution, and local availability of illicit
substances. Congress could direct that interdiction efforts, and
the balance between supply and demand efforts, continue on the
same track. </p>

<p> If Congress decided to increase federal efforts in demand
reduction efforts, it could adopt any of three methods: 1)
increase appropriations for treatment and prevention programs; 2)
redirect some of the interdiction funds to increase support for
treatment and prevention programs; or 3) require that assets
forfeited in drug seizures be increasingly used to support
treatment and prevention programs. If Congress chose to simply
increase appropriations for additional treatment and prevention
programs, this option would require raising the current level of
federal spending for drug control efforts at a time when the
federal deficit is a key concern. Since costly interdiction and
incarceration programs have not eliminated either the supply of
illicit substances or the demand for and use of such substances,
Congress could decide to increase appropriations for treatment
and prevention programs by reallocating funds currently spent in
drug interdiction and law enforcement activities; this would mean
a drop in supply-side efforts such as drug interdiction and law
enforcement activities. The reallocation of assets forfeited in
drug seizures to treatment and prevention programs, if done
together with closer coordination of local antidrug efforts among
law enforcement and treatment and prevention practitioners, may
be an attractive small step. Congress could direct that ONDCP
monitor the reallocation of such assets, to ensure the flow of
funds to programs that directly focus on substance abuse and
addiction and, programs that do not directly address substance
abuse and addiction but that target risk and protective factors
known to be associated with abuse and addiction. </p>

<p> Many stakeholders agree that the federal antidrug effort
should be more focused on treatment and prevention. Widespread
disagreement exists, however, as to whether such additional
treatment and prevention efforts should be created at the expense
of, or in addition to, current supply-side efforts. </p>

<p> Structure of ONDCP </p>

<p> Since its creation in 1988, ONDCP has served as the most
visible federal entity in the war on drugs. The Director, the
so-called drug czar, has the opportunity to galvanize public
attention on federal antidrug efforts, and to propose and
advocate policies within the White House. ONDCP's effectiveness
is limited, however, both in its statute and through its
operation as a White House office. Congress could choose to
reauthorize ONDCP, and in so doing maintain or alter its mission
and authority; or allow ONDCP to expire. </p>

<p> If Congress chooses to reauthorize ONDCP, a number of options
exist for altering its mission. Congress could: </p>

<p> o Direct ONDCP to address the full range of the most harmful
abusable substances, including alcohol, tobacco, and inhalants.
Although federally funded prevention programs address the range
of abusable substances, the statute creating ONDCP emphasized
illicit substances. As a result, ONDCP has historically provided
limited attention on abusable substances that have been
associated with higher levels of death and injury than illicit
drugs. More recently, ONDCP increased the focus in its National
Drug Control Strategy on the illicit use of alcohol and tobacco
by minors because of the extensive damage to the health and
safety of minors, resulting from the use and abuse of these
substances. This approach could be enhanced through congressional
authorization. </p>

<p> o Alter ONDCP's leadership structure. ONDCP by statute has a
Deputy Director of Supply Reduction and a Deputy Director for
Demand Reduction. This structure has, in part, resulted in an
ongoing public policy debate regarding the overall federal focus
on antidrug efforts, with supply-side and demand-side reduction
efforts seen by some as philosophically incompatible (see
discussion on supply versus demand reduction earlier in this
chapter). By creating an alternative structure, ONDCP may be
encouraged to adopt programs that more closely link various
elements of the antidrug strategy (e.g., a focus on drug
availability could link current supply-side elements that target
physical availability of a drug with current demand-side efforts
that focus on economic and social availability, as discussed in
chapter 4). Despite the advantages that may result from a new
organizational structure, the simplicity of the current structure
makes it easier to provide a sharper focus on supply and demand
elements of the National Drug Control Strategy. </p>

<p> o Give ONDCP increased authority over federal agency antidrug
programs. Although ONDCP is charged with leading a war on drugs,
its authority is limited to a coordinating function. Congress
could provide the Director of ONDCP with specific authority over
certain elements of various federal programs, or with additional
authority over federal agency budget proposals. Such actions
would give the drug czar more substantive authority to direct the
war on drugs, but would likely be viewed by some federal agencies
as an unwarranted intrusion in agency matters. </p>

<p> o Mandate the size of ONDCP. Because it is part of the
Executive Office of the President, ONDCP is subject to increased
political manipulation by each administration. Recently, for
example, ONDCP took the largest personnel cut of any White House
office to meet President Clinton's pledge of a 25 percent
reduction in overall size of White House staff. While mandating a
specific size for ONDCP might lead to increased effectiveness for
the office, it would hamper White House efforts to control staff
size. </p>

<p> Alternatively, Congress could allow the authorization for
ONDCP to expire. While ONDCP has produced National Drug Control
Strategies that summarize and set policy for federal efforts, the
office lacks the authority to shape the antidrug policies of the
federal agencies. Coordination of antidrug efforts is difficult
at best when the number of relevant agencies is so large; since
antidrug policy involves many federal agencies, it might make
sense to disband ONDCP and rely on efforts by diverse federal
agencies to continue to address the many aspects of the drug
problem. Recent reductions in the size of the ONDCP staff, as a
part of the down-sizing of the White House staff, could make this
an opportune time to eliminate the office altogether. Terminating
ONDCP would, however, be viewed by many as federal abdication of
the war on drugs. </p>

<p> Structure of Federal Substance Abuse Prevention Programs </p>

<p> Federal efforts supporting substance abuse prevention
programs are housed at a number of agencies. Congress recently
reorganized the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health
Administration (ADAMHA), splitting service-based components into
the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
(SAMHSA) and research-based components--the National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), the National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the National Institute on Mental Health
(NIMH)-- into the National Institutes of Health (NIH). More
recently, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has been renamed
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP), which has
already expanded its title and mission to include prevention.
Congress could maintain the current structure if it determines
that substance abuse is a problem that has many aspects and
deserves to be addressed by many agencies and in many settings. </p>

<p> If Congress decided to create a more centralized structure,
it could enact legislation designating a single federal entity as
the chief agency for prevention efforts, or merge the components
of various agencies under one federal roof. Possibilities
include: </p>

<p> o Merging NIDA and NIAAA into a single National Institute on
Substance Abuse and Addiction. The use of multiple substances
(including alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, and heroin) is
increasingly reported by researchers and practitioners. Indeed,
the gateway theory or hypothesis focuses on the progression in
the use of substances, beginning with alcohol and tobacco (which
are illegal for youth, but legal for adults) and moving to
marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. Since clinicians and researchers
have increasingly commented on the progression in substance use
and on the co-occurrence of the use of multiple substances, the
separation of the major federal research agencies into an alcohol
agency (NIAAA) and a drug agency (NIDA) is more and more
inconsistent with the shape of the problem. The Center for
Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) is an integrated substance
abuse agency that explicitly focuses on alcohol, tobacco, and
other drugs, and all state alcohol and drug abuse agencies are
now integrated or located in the same place. To facilitate more
integrated and coherent research on the range of abusable
substances, NIDA and NIAAA could be combined into a national
institute on substance abuse and addiction. Such a merger would
further integrate the federal research efforts in substance
abuse, but might be seen by some as downplaying the emphasis
given to illicit substances. </p>

<p> o Place CSAP in CDCP or in the Health Resources and Services
Administration (HRSA). CDCP could give the substance abuse
prevention field a solid base in the health and medical sciences,
especially in the tracking and prevention of diseases. HRSA could
give CSAP a broader health care environment to work within, which
includes Community Health Centers and the National Health Service
Corps. One disadvantage to the merging of CSAP into either of
these other health agencies is that it would emphasize the
medical aspects and interventions of drug prevention and downplay
the many nonmedical factors and interventions that are important
in the onset of substance use and abuse. Merger would also
present problems of moving people--CSAP is headquartered in
Rockville, Maryland, while CDCP is headquartered in Atlanta,
Georgia--and threaten the loss of identity that some proponents
of CSAP say is found in an agency that solely addresses substance
abuse and prevention. However, the fragmentation of the federal
effort on substance abuse prevention has been viewed by some as
extreme and counterproductive, and the efforts of ONDCP have not
succeeded in achieving coordination across departments. </p>

<p> o Merge federal substance abuse prevention efforts into a
single agency, such as CSAP. CSAP has been working
collaboratively with the staff in many other federal agencies,
and would be seen as a natural leader for this effort. In
addition, its recent efforts to begin to develop standards of
practice for substance abuse and addiction prevention programs
could be continued and more effectively infused into the
components of programs currently in other agencies and
departments. </p>

<p> Evaluation of Prevention Programs </p>

<p> Current drug prevention programs lack scientifically accepted
standards for determining their success or failure. Most
evaluations focus on the processes used in formulating and
implementing a prevention program (e.g., who was involved, what
type of program was used) and outcome evaluation (e.g., how many
people were part of the program, how the program was replicated).
Congress could allow the current level of process and outcome
evaluation related to substance abuse prevention programs to
continue. </p>

<p> If it chose to improve the quality of program evaluation,
Congress could direct NIDA and NIAAA, or CSAP to design, lead,
and support a multiyear national process (involving
representatives of other federal agencies and of outside
organizations) to forge consensus on standardized definitions and
outcome measures, using technical reviews, consensus-forming
techniques, and technical assistance monographs. These
definitions and measures could include substance use, heavy
drinking, substance abuse, substance addiction or dependency, and
related behavioral problems such as school truancy, unemployment,
delinquent and criminal behaviors, and the like. CSAP, NIDA,
NIAAA, the Department of Education (DOE), and other federal
agencies could be required to increase funding and technical
assistance for process and outcome evaluations through grants and
contracts. CSAP could focus on process evaluations that may
assist program managers throughout the course of a program. NIDA
and NIAA could focus on outcome evaluations that are more
rigorously designed and conducted by individuals who are
independent of the programs being evaluated. DoE could require
both process and outcome evaluations by states and by schools,
using Drug-Free School monies. NIDA, NIAAA, or CSAP could be
directed to provide incentives for researchers and programs to
participate in a national program database, using consistent
definitions and including data from multiple evaluations. The
creation of such a database would allow researchers to extend
their own analyses by tapping into data from other program sites
and populations that have used consistent definitions and
measures. </p>

<p> States could be required by legislation to use a portion of
their 20 percent prevention set-asides under the Alcohol and Drug
Abuse Block Grant program and a portion of their Drug- Free
Schools funds for evaluation of substance abuse prevention
programs. Since evaluations of prevention programs can be
expensive, Congress could consider increasing block grant funding
levels to allow increases in evaluation studies without requiring
decreases in programs. If such an option were enacted, Congress
could mandate that evaluations be conducted by independent
bodies, such as university-based researchers, rather than by
state government agencies that have vested interests in
demonstrating program effectiveness. </p>

<p> RESEARCH NEEDS </p>

<p> Data Collection </p>

<p> The National Household Survey and the National Survey of High
School Seniors have developed credibility over the years for
their regular reporting of substance use in households and high
schools. These surveys could be allowed to continue, with no
substantial changes in the cost, frequency of data collection,
focus on target groups, analysis, and sharing of the database. </p>

<p> Because of the methodology employed, national surveys miss or
underreport various populations. Much of the data now collected
focuses on substance use (e.g., any use within the past 30 days
or anytime in a lifetime), rather than on more intense substance
abuse and addiction. In addition, questions are
substance-specific, and less oriented to the use and abuse of
multiple substances. Such polydrug users and abusers are
increasingly being identified by researchers and clinicians.
While substance use is a key precondition to later abuse and
addiction, most individuals who use illicit substances do not go
on to addiction. Thus, an important question for the development
of prevention policies and programs is: What are the
characteristics of individuals who abuse and become addicted to
substances, and how do they make the transition from use to abuse
and addiction? </p>

<p> If Congress felt that current data do not provide adequate
information, it could direct that the Household and High School
Surveys be conducted less intensely or less frequently. The
expense of these surveys, especially the National Household
Survey, is high. In 1992, the High School Survey cost about $3
million, and the Household Survey costover $12 million. Spending
could be reduced if the survey data were compiled less intensely
(e.g., with fewer questions or from a smaller sample) or less
frequently. Alternatively, Congress could direct NIDA to develop
and support survey methodology that reaches populations missed by
current surveys (notably the homeless, school dropouts, and
residents of some inner-city and rural areas), or through
legislation, create a mechanism, comparable to the release of
economic indicators, for the regular and nonpolitical release of
survey data. Data could then be released through a well-defined
process that includes careful and timely technical reviews for
compliance with high standards of data collection and analysis,
rather than being subjected to bureaucratic or political reviews
that may delay the release of or bias the data. </p>

<p> Individual Risk and Protective Factors </p>

<p> A substantial body of research has been developed regarding
potential risk and protective factors for children and
adolescents. A variety of theories has been developed concerning
how many and which risk factors increase the chances for a child
or adolescent to first use alcohol or other drugs. Historically,
one of the flaws with much of the risk and protective factor
research has been that studies analyzed one factor in isolation
from all others. Increasingly though, researchers are examining a
wider variety of factors among different populations, as well as
using more complex data analysis procedures. Even so,
sophisticated multifactor research studies are still in the
minority. </p>

<p> While a substantial amount of risk and protective factor
research has focused on children and adolescents, not as much is
known about factors among other populations. Recent research has
led to interest in the possibility of further analyses in
selected populations and/or selected risk or protective factors.
Some examples: </p>

<p> o Adults. Additional research in this area could result in
learning more about factors associated with long-term drug abuse
and addiction as well as the importance of factors more often
found in adult populations (e.g., effects of aging, death of a
spouse or child, divorce). Data from a recent National Household
Survey on Drug Abuse show that individuals aged 18 to 25, and 26
to 34, respectively, have the two highest reported rates for
heavy drinking and smoking, past month use of cocaine, crack,
marijuana and hashish, or psychotherapeutic drugs. Additionally,
gender, racial, and ethnic substance use differences appear
within the adult population. Some research has indicated that
women who drink heavily do so several years later than men,
although the reasons for this remain unclear. Researchers also
indicate that black men who drink heavily, do so in their late
twenties and early thirties, in contrast to white men whose
drinking peaks at age 15 to early twenties. Increased research on
the adult population could be useful in developing appropriate
substance abuse prevention and treatment programs for adults. </p>

<p> o Race and Ethnicity. The biological and genetic substance
abuse studies completed on different racial and ethnic groups
have been few in number, mostly limited to alcohol, and
inconclusive. While race and ethnicity have not been shown to be
biological or genetic predictors for substance use, abuse, or
addiction, certain risk factors appear to be unique for specific
cultures. To date, however, the racial and ethnic categories used
in many large-scale studies are so broad that many researchers
consider them useless. Increased federal funding for studies of
specific subpopulations living in geographically different areas
(e.g., urban versus rural, reservation versus nonreservation)
will provide much needed baseline data on which to plan,
implement, and evaluate appropriate substance abuse services. </p>

<p> o Poverty. Disagreement exists on the appropriate definition
of poverty and its exact relationship to substance abuse. While
few researchers deny that the daily stresses associated with
living in chronic poverty probably contribute to substance abuse,
poverty is certainly not the only factor, or perhaps even the
most important. There are after all, more individuals living in
poverty who do not abuse substances than who do. However, the
consequences of substance abuse appear to be worse in chronically
poor areas. Additional research to study the complex relationship
between poverty and substance abuse could provide substance abuse
practitioners with a framework from which to build programs most
suitable for the special needs of chronically poor areas. </p>

<p> Congress can, through its reauthorization and oversight
powers, monitor the amount and scope of risk and protective
factor research that is being conducted, and redirect federal
efforts toward more extensive multifactor research and analysis,
as appropriate. Such focus could include factors other than
substance use that may contribute to later abuse and addiction,
such as other problem behaviors, availability, marketing,
psychological factors, social norms in communities, and
subcultures. The increased use of ethnographers as part of a
multidisciplinary drug abuse prevention research teams could also
be encouraged. </p>

<p> Biomedical Research </p>

<p> Biomedical research on substance abuse helps explain the
acute and chronic biological effects of substances on the brain
and other organs, and also points to appropriate short- and
long-term medical treatments for substance abuse. This in turn
helps treatment providers understand treatment outcomes and
relapse rates for long-term abusers. Most federally supported
biomedical research is administered by the 17 institutes that
comprise the NIH. With the passage of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse,
and Mental Health Administration Reorganization Act of 1992
(Public Law 102-321), NIDA and the NIAAA were moved to NIH.
Research targeting substance use, abuse, and addiction is
supported primarily by these two institutes, whose combined
appropriation level ($580.7 million in fiscal year 1994) is
approximately 5 percent of the NIH total. </p>

<p> Congress has historically increased annual appropriations for
biomedical research at NIH; if Congress continues this trend,
both NIDA and NIAAA annual appropriations will rise, although not
at the dramatic levels many scientists would like. If Congress
were to decide that substance abuse and addiction should command
more of the nation's biomedical research budget, it could
substantially raise appropriation levels for NIDA and NIAAA. Such
an action would allow increased levels of research in a number of
areas including: genetics; drug development; identification of
biological factors related to transitions from casual drug use to
abuse, addiction, and dependence; the pharmacology of multiple
drug use; environmental factors and their effect on individual
biological susceptibility; and the biological effects of drug use
and abuse on the development of children and adolescents. Given
budget realities, however, an increase in the funding levels
available for basic biomedical research could mean a decrease
somewhere else. </p>

<p> A number of budgetary pressures have recently slowed robust
NIH budget growth, including the need to fund disease- specific
research (e.g., acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), indirect
costs of research, and the increasing pressure to limit
discretionary spending. Some scientists identify stable budget
growth--as opposed to sporadic increases targeted at particular
topics--as most important for continued progress in research. In
fiscal year 1994, both NIDA and NIAAA received a 5.2 percent
increase in appropriations, following an Administration request
that would have raised NIDA's appropriation by less than 1
percent, and decreased NIAAA's appropriation by 1.6 percent.
Fluctuations in appropriation levels could impede the development
of scientific advances that are necessary to the creation of new
medications and therapies. </p>

<p> The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in its March 1994
report to Congress, Reducing the Deficit: Spending and Revenue
Options, identified a reduction in funding for NIH research as
one of nearly 200 policy options. As noted by CBO, a reduction in
NIH funding could have adverse effects on biomedical research and
might cause some researchers to leave the field. NIH cannot
currently fund the majority of grants it approves; in addition,
funding is insufficient to support some important areas of
research. According to a 1992 General Accounting Office report on
Drug Abuse Research: Federal Funding and Future Needs, antidrug
research appears now to have a very modest role, with only about
4 percent of total drug strategy spending devoted to research and
development. </p>

<p> COMMUNITY ACTIVITY SETTINGS </p>

<p> Substance abuse and addiction occur in communities around our
Nation. Those who believe that drug abuse and addiction are
closely related to social and economic problems argue that
antidrug programs should more directly address the risk and
protective factors that have been identified by researchers. Many
prevention program providers also argue that the most successful
programs are those that are more comprehensive in scope (i.e.,
tailored to address the many community settings in which drug
abuse can occur) rather than addressing one or two risk factors
in isolation. </p>

<p> In conducting this assessment, OTA surveyed literatures
addressing substance abuse and addiction in various community
settings--families and homes, schools and peers, workplaces, and
recreational settings (see ch. 8). The literature reviews
presented in this report make clear that substance abuse and
addiction can arise and be influenced by multiple factors in
individuals, groups, and communities. Thus, effective
intervention ideally should be comprehensive, employing multiple
services and addressing the many factors that cause drug abuse
and addiction; and community-based, sensitive to and directed at
the needs of the local population. </p>

<p> Still, three problems arise in assessing policy options
related to community settings: </p>

<p> 1. There is the inherent difficulty in drawing a link between
many social services and their effect on drug abuse and
addiction. </p>

<p> 2. Since broad-based social services are provided through the
work of many federal agencies, further analysis (e.g., by ONDCP
or a congressionally enacted national commission) could identify
which federal agencies are best suited to implement the variety
of options that Congress may wish to employ. </p>

<p> 3. The federal budget deficit is an obstacle to the creation
of new domestic programs that target known risk and protective
factors in individuals and communities. </p>

<p> Schools and Peers </p>

<p> The primary focus of federal efforts at community-based drug
prevention is programs aimed at our nation's schoolchildren. In
fiscal year 1993, Congress appropriated $598 million to DOE under
the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986. The federal
government could continue to fund school-based prevention
programs, with a continued emphasis on prevention curricula and
evaluations that are limited to substance use prevention. The
likely limited effects on preventing abuse among high-risk youth
would continue. Other school-based prevention programs would
continue to be implemented sporadically, without significant
evaluation and with few or unknown effects. </p>

<p> If Congress decided that more rigorous evaluation of school-
based programs was called for, it could mandate DOE to spend a
set percent of its Drug Free Schools monies on research and
evaluation of prevention curricula and the dissemination of
findings. A special initiative could be launched to test
prevention curricula for high-risk youth and for different racial
and ethnic groups, since most of the research and evaluation to
date has been based on samples of schools with middle income
white youth. Special expertise would need to be brought in, on
staff and as advisers, to assure the research and evaluation meet
high standards of methodological rigor. This could be achieved by
hiring staff with research and evaluation expertise, detailing
staff from the NIDA, setting up an interdepartmental advisory
group that guides and oversees a research and evaluation program,
or appropriating funds directly to NIDA (e.g., as a set- aside
from the Drug-Free Schools appropriation) to support such a
research and evaluation program. Also, easier access to
information about the many drug prevention curricula that exist
could help school personnel select curricula that fit their
needs. DOE could be directed to prepare and disseminate more
widely information about the purposes, design, methods, resources
required, and evaluations (if any) of drug prevention curricula
currently available, and to inform school personnel of the
limitations of school- based curriculum approaches and the
growing availability of supplementary and alternative approaches.
If Congress decided that Drug-Free Schools funds should be used
more widely to target risk and protective factors found in
school-aged populations, it could require DOE to set aside a
certain percentage of Drug-Free Schools funds for a variety of
activities that target high-risk youths and to work individually
with them and their families. Such targeting could enhance
activities already carried out under the Drug- Free Schools Act
(e.g., Drug Abuse Resistance Education, replication of successful
programs, local programs for high- risk youth, school personnel
training). However, congressional mandates could reduce state and
local flexibility in tailoring programs best suited to local
needs, and could increase administrative costs associated with
implementing the Drug-Free Schools Act. </p>

<p> In addition to Drug-Free Schools programs, comprehensive
primary health, mental health, and social services can be
provided in many school-based clinics. School-based clinics can
be supported by a variety of federal funding sources, including
Medicaid, the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, Drug-Free
Schools, and Special Education funds. DOE and the Department of
Health and Human Services could be encouraged or directed to
collaborate on the support of such services in schools. </p>

<p> Since researchers have found that peers and other social
influences strongly affect substance use, programs that
strengthen total school environments may be potent in preventing
substance use and abuse. Models that involve school
restructuring, parent involvement, mental health components, and
elevated expectations for achievement have been developed and are
being tested. The hypothesis is that engaging high-risk youth in
positive educational environments and experiences can profoundly
influence their behaviors for the better. Congress could expand
research on the effects of restructuring of school environments
on substance abuse by appropriating funds for extensive large-
scale longitudinal research that could be supported by DOE, NIDA,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP), and other
federal agencies that conduct and support research on youth
outcomes. </p>

<p> Homes and Families </p>

<p> Congress appropriates funds for federal programs addressing
substance abuse and addiction in homes and families, which are
supported by the HUD and HHS' Administration on Children, Youth,
and Families (ACYF) and CSAP. Also relevant to the health and
welfare of families are health funding programs (e.g., Medicaid
and Medicare) and welfare programs (e.g., Aid to Families with
Dependent Children). Through its oversight, authorization, and
appropriations of these programs, and others that impact on the
quality of family life, Congress can support a number of
preventive interventions that are both comprehensive and
intensive. Programs can be initiated by almost any local service
or support setting, such as health care, school, family
preservation, juvenile justice, and housing authority, with
coordination with other services and settings. Such interventions
can include health care, counseling, intensive in-home services,
neighborhood patrols, clean sweeps of public housing, and family
and parent education for all family members. </p>

<p> Because substance abuse and other related problems can be
influenced by so many family factors and programs, a long- term
effort to identify family needs may be desired. Congress could
enact legislation to create a Presidential commission or task
force to formulate a national family policy and create a
blueprint for long-term national efforts to shore up the many
families, rich and poor, that would benefit from more guidance,
skills, and support. Such a national policy could be framed in
the near-term, based on the many studies and program
interventions that have been documented so far. Alternatively, it
could be formulated later, after additional research and program
interventions have been supported and major gaps in knowledge
have been filled. </p>

<p> Workplaces </p>

<p> Congress could allow current activities that focus on
providing workplace employees with information, development of
drug-free workplace policies, drug testing, and employee
assistance programs to continue. These programs are scattered
among many federal agencies, with some leadership by the
Department of Labor (DOL), CSAP, and the Office of Management and
Budget. </p>

<p> If Congress chose to increase efforts in workplace antidrug
prevention, it could mandate that federal agencies increase the
information that is made available to workplaces about drug-free
workplace programs and policies. For example, DOL is implementing
an electronic database, with information about workplace
substance abuse treatment, prevention, and other control programs
and research. Such a database, if properly supported, publicized,
and accessed by businesses and unions, could help workplaces
identify and implement approaches that can meet their needs in
affordable ways. </p>

<p> Recreational and Community Settings </p>

<p> Congress currently funds community partnership demonstration
programs administered by CSAP. These partnerships foster
public/private sector partnerships that create and preserve
comprehensive strategies for addressing substance abuse
prevention within communities. A major advantage of these
partnerships is the ability to create programs that address
substance abuse prevention within individual communities. As with
other drug prevention programs, however, evaluation has generally
been limited. Congress could, through appropriations and
authorization, direct CSAP to expand the provision of technical
assistance and expand the national process and outcome evaluation
of partnerships. More site visits would be possible, with
additional resources for national and regional workshops,
conferences, and training. </p>

<p> Other federal activities in this area remain limited and
largely uncoordinated. Major current programs are administered by
the Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension Service
(with its 4-H program, which is refocusing its efforts on
high-risk youth) and CSAP (through some of its High Risk Youth
Demonstration Grants). The President's Council on Physical
Fitness addresses one aspect of recreational and leisure
activities--that is, physical fitness. If Congress decided to
provide more information and support more research on
recreational, leisure, and other youth development programs, an
information clearinghouse could be established to share
information about federal and non-federal recreational, leisure,
and youth development activities. The purpose would be to help
communities and program developers identify and develop such
programs especially for youth at risk of drug use and abuse. The
clearinghouse could be managed in-house or under contract, and
could be located in the Cooperative Extension Service (which is
now attempting to redirect 4-H programs to address high-risk
youth); ACYF; or CSAP (perhaps in the existing National Center
for Alcohol and Drug Information, a federally sponsored
clearinghouse). </p>

<p> The dearth of recreational places, especially in highly
developed urban areas, can be remedied by an enhanced national
effort to acquire land and facilities for park and recreation
purposes. Such an effort could focus especially, but not
exclusively, on rural and inner city areas where low property
values make the acquisition of such properties financially
attractive as long-term investments in the future development and
enrichment of communities. Such a national effort could be
comparable in scope and long-termcommitment to the development of
the national park system, but could contribute to a broader
national system of parks owned and managed by the federal, state,
and local governments specifically for more intense human uses.
Such a system could focus on the developmental needs of youth,
especially in urban areas, where usable open spaces are often in
short supply. Congress could designate a lead federal agency for
such an effort (e.g., Department of Interior or HUD), and could
acquire properties outright or by encouraging and subsidizing the
acquisition of properties by nonprofit groups and by state and
local governments. The latter approach would require less federal
funding and administration. Possible sources of land and
facilities include: closed military bases, holdings of the
Resolution Trust Corporation, assets forfeited through drug
seizures, individual gifts and bequests, and corporate and
philanthropic gifts. </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY </p>

<p> The primary current focus of federal antidrug efforts is
stemming the physical supply of illicit drugs. A multitude of
policy issues arise in addressing drug availability, most of
which are beyond the scope of this report. The discussion in
chapter 4, however, touches on two availability issues currently
on the congressional agenda. </p>

<p> Taxes </p>

<p> The federal government currently levies excise taxes on
alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. Excise taxes on all
types of alcoholic beverages were raised in 1990 to their current
levels. Currently, for example, beer (six pack, 12-ounce cans)
carries a 33 cent federal excise tax, a 750 ml bottle of wine
carries a 21 cent federal excise tax. A pack of cigarettes
carries a federal excise tax of 24 cents. If Congress takes no
action, current federal levies will remain in effect. </p>

<p> Congress could enact legislation raising the federal excise
tax on a variety of tobacco and alcohol products if it sought to
decrease consumption of such products, to recover estimated
societal costs (i.e., health costs, injury, </p>

<p> death) resulting from consumption of such products, or to
raise revenue for federal spending programs. Such tax hikes could
be targeted at all tobacco and alcohol products, or at selected
products in these industries. Advocates of increased excise taxes
have argued that abuse of and addiction to tobacco and alcohol
products cost the United States more than any illicit substance;
that increased taxes would make such products less economically
affordable and hence less used and abused; that increased taxes
could be used to pay for financial damages arising from the use
of such products; and that such excise taxes, which have
increased less rapidly than the general rate of inflation, should
be adjusted upward to reflect inflation. Opponents of taxation
have argued that excise taxes are regressive in that they target
primarily low- and middle- income taxpayers, that increased taxes
would result in significant losses to major companies that are
important players in the American economy, and that targeting
so-called sin taxes unfairly singles out millions of Americans
who use tobacco and alcohol products. </p>

<p> Alcohol Labeling </p>

<p> Federal law currently requires that each alcoholic beverage
container bear a specific warning statement that is conspicuously
and prominently located (27 USC 215). This requirement was
enacted by Congress in 1980. Both Congress and States have
authority regulating alcohol advertising. At least 35 states
regulate alcohol advertising, and self-policing by segments of
industry places some limits on advertising (e.g., the distilled
spirits industry code prohibits the advertising of liquor on
radio or television). </p>

<p> Congress has considered legislation that would require
warnings on all alcohol beverage advertising, both print and
electronic media. Congress could amend current alcohol labeling
law to require stricter labeling (e.g., multiple labels, rotating
labels, specific messages). Opponents of such action argue that
no significant relationship has been found between exposure of
individuals to alcoholic beverage advertising and/or labeling and
drinking behaviors. _ <br>

<hr>

<p>During the 1960s, Dr. Ralph M. Susman of the United States
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and his associate
Lenore R. Kupperstein, prepared a &quot;Bibliography on the
Inhalation of Glue Fumes and Other Toxic Vapors,&quot; which they
published in the Spring 1968 issue of the International Journal
of the Addictions. Despite diligent search, the earliest
references to glue-sniffing in either the medical or the popular
literature that they were able to find dated from 1959.1 A
similarly thorough search in the course of preparing this
Consumers Union Report has turned up no earlier mention of
glue-sniffing. Other documented studies of glue-sniffing are
similarly void of references earlier than 1959. Thus, while it is
likely that children (and adults as well) sniffed glue on
occasion before 1959, the practice either went unobserved or,
more probably, was not deemed worthy of recording. The first
known mentions of glue-sniffing in print date from 1959 and
concern the arrest for sniffing glue of children in Tucson,
Arizona, Pueblo, Colorado, and perhaps other Western cities. Laws
against sniffing glue or sniffing anything else, of course, did
not yet exist. Accounts of these remarkable arrests reached
Denver, where two reporters investigated. Their account of
glue-sniffing-the first full description in the mass media that
has yet turned up-appeared in Empire, the Sunday magazine
supplement of the Denver Post, on August 2, 1959. The article
reported: &quot;Police in Pueblo, Colo. and several other cities
in the West and Midwest report that juveniles seeking a quick
bang and a mild jag spread liquid glue on the palms of their
hands, then cup their hands over their mouth and nose and inhale
deeply.&quot; 2 Alerted by these police actions in other cities,
the two reporters interviewed Denver police officers concerned
with juvenile problems, and other authorities, to learn about
glue-sniffing in Denver. Apparently Denver bad no cases to
report, for the story led off with an account of a child
accidentally affected by glue fumes in a poorly-ventilated
basement room; and an expert the two reporters interviewed-Dr.
Samuel Johnson, director of Denver's Poison Control
Center-similarly warned against using quick-drying glue in a room
with the windows closed, lest intoxication accidentally result.
Dr. Johnson was on the whole reassuring about the glue
&quot;menace.&quot; If a person is affected by the fumes, he
said, he need only go out and breathe fresh air to recover.
Permanent injury is possible only if the exposure is prolonged
and heavy-as when a worker in a glue factory breathes the stuff
all day long every day. Yet the pioneer Denver story, setting a
pattern soon to be followed by newspapers and magazines
throughout the country, carried a scare headline: </p>

<p>SOME GLUES ARE DANGEROUS Heavy Inhalation Can Cause Anemia or
Brain Damage This and subsequent warnings in the mass media were
all based on the results of earlier industrial studies that, as
noted above, could not be justifiably applied to the
glue-sniffing fad. The newspaper story also explained that one
way to inhale glue is to soak a handkerchief with glue and hold
it over the mouth and nose.&quot; A photograph accompanying the
article showed a young man demonstrating how the glue-soaked
handkerchief should be held. Interesting results were promised if
the glue were sniffed as directed: &quot;The first effect of
breathing the undiluted fumes is dizziness, followed by
drowsiness. There is a feeling of suspension of reality. Later
there is lack of coordination of muscle and mind.&quot; In a
word, it was like getting drunk. The effects of this newspaper
article, published August 2, 1959-and no doubt of other similar
articles and broadcasts in other Denver mass media
thereafter-were visible by June 1960, when Denver police reported
that during the past six or eight months they had investigated
some 50 cases of glue-sniffing. In addition to these 50 cases, of
course, there were no doubt many hundreds of others which had not
come to the attention of the police. Denver was thus experiencing
what-so far as the available literature reveals-was the earliest
of many similar local glue-sniffing epidemics throughout the
country. Denver police met the new peril in the usual way-by
escalating the warnings. In August 1959, Denver glue-sniffers had
been threatened merely with anemia and brain damage. In June 1960
a spokesman for Denver's juvenile Police Bureau was quoted as
saying: &quot;This practice is extremely dangerous, and a kid can
die from it if he gets too much.&quot; A second police spokesman
added that &quot;inhaling large quantities of the cement fumes
can lead to permanent injury of the respiratory system and could
cause death.&quot; And the head of the Police Crime Laboratory
warned: &quot;I'm afraid some kid will get hold of too much of
the stuff and we'll have a fatal case on our hands.&quot; 3 In
October 1961 a Denver police lieutenant was quoted as explaining
that glue fumes &quot;diminish the oxygen supply to the
blood&quot; and &quot;cause severe brain damage and death .&quot;
4 A representative in the state legislature warned that
glue-sniffing &quot;can </p>

<p>result in permanent damage to the brain.&quot; 5 In April 1962
Denver youngsters were warned that glue-sniffing causes
&quot;stimulation of the central nervous system, followed by
depression and often convulsions,&quot; and that &quot;it can
affect the respiratory tract, mucous membranes, skin, liver,
kidneys, heart and blood-depending on what type of glue is
used.&quot; 6 The headline over the June 1960 story presented the
two central themes which were later to characterize
anti-glue-sniffing propaganda in other cities as well: </p>

<p>COULD BE FATAL Plane Glue Gives Kids a Kick </p>

<p>Far from ending Denver's glue-sniffing epidemic, however,
these warnings were followed by a further spread of the epidemic.
The warnings seemed to function as lures. By October 23, 1961,
the chief probation officer of the Denver juvenile Court was able
to announce: &quot;We are averaging about 30 boys a month now on
this glue-sniffing problem.&quot; Worse yet, he added, the custom
was spreading from the high schools into the junior highs and
&quot;even into the grade schools.&quot; I A police spokesman
similarly announced that glue-sniffing, unknown 26 months
earlier, was now &quot;a major problem among juveniles in
Denver.&quot; He noted that 278 arrests were made for
glue-sniffing in 1961, as compared with only 95 in 1960.8 Nor was
the problem limited to Denver. Tom Adams, director of the state
reform school in Golden, Colorado, was quoted in October 1961:
&quot;Right now I have about 50 boys here because of this
glue-sniffing.&quot; 9 Since no city or state law against
glue-sniffing had yet been passed, the reporter who covered the
story felt called upon to explain how 278 arrests could be made
in 1961 for glue-sniffing and how 50 children could be
incarcerated in a reform school for the same offense. His
explanation, however, did not entirely clarify the mystery. All
he could say was that &quot;the youths are charged under juvenile
delinquency procedures when they are found sniffing glue.&quot; A
police spokesman added a detail: the 278 Denver arrests for
glue-sniffing were classed for statistical purposes as
&quot;drunkenness arrests.&quot;' Throughout 1960 and 1961,
Denver police made further headlines by periodic raids on
glue-sniffers. A typical 1961 example was headed: </p>

<p>* Readers should not be surprised at this development, for a
substantial proportion of arrests and incarcerations of juveniles
throughout the country are for actions which are not prohibited
by any law and which would not be crimes if indulged in by
adults. (See Ruth and Edward Brecher, The Delinquent and the Law,
Public Affairs Pamphlet No. 337 [New York: Public Affairs
Pamphlets, 1962]; also, The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society,
A Report by the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and
Administration of Justice [New York: Avon Books 1968], . 227-228.
</p>

<p>7 DENVER YOUTHS ARRESTED FOR DEADLY &quot;GLUE-SNIFFING&quot;
The story began: </p>

<p>Seven Denver teenagers were arrested over the weekend for
&quot;glue-sniffing,&quot; a new thrill-seeking activity that
juvenile authorities label &quot;extremely dangerous.&quot; Five
of the boys, four of them 16 and the other 17, are in City jail.
Two others, 13 and 14, were lodged in juvenile Hall. All seven
were arrested Sunday near the Curtis Park Recreation Center, 50th
and Curtis Sts., by Patrolmen Dale Nelson and Donald Smith.10 </p>

<p>Thus the broad pattern was established-the dramatic police
raids and the imprisonment of children and teenagers, accompanied
by dire warnings of physical and psychological damage. The next
element in the pattern was soon added: proposals for specific
antiglue legislation. On December 8, 1961, just six weeks after
the sensational Curtis Park police raid, the Denver papers
reported that State Representative Ben Klein, a former probation
officer, would &quot;propose to the January [1962] session of the
Colorado Legislature three new laws to deter youngsters from
sniffing airplane glue. . . .&quot; 11 Denver youngsters no doubt
noted the order of events: arrests and jailings first,
legislation later-a sequence unlikely to encourage respect for
law. In support of his three new laws, Representative Klein
quoted Denver's juvenile Court judge Philip Gilliam as saying
that he considered gluesniffing to be now &quot;the Number I
juvenile problem in the metropolitan area.&quot; Glue-sniffing
had achieved this preeminence within two and a half years after
the two writers in Empire had found no evidence of gluesniffing
in Denver. Representative Klein's three laws would make it an
offense (1) to sell glue to minors without parental consent, (2)
to drive a car while under the influence of glue, or (3) to sniff
glue. This last proposed offense was remarkable-for, as noted in
Part 1, it is not an offense to use even such drugs as heroin, in
Denver or elsewhere in the United States. Representative Klein
said his legislation would also require retailers &quot;to keep a
registry of sales . . . similar to the registry of sales of
narcotics drugs.&quot; Thus glue-sniffing was more or less subtly
linked with heroin. just as arrests for glue-sniffing were
followed by laws against gluesniffing, so medical warnings were
followed by medical studies designed to justify the warnings. A
study undertaken by Dr. Oliver Massengale, director of the
Adolescent Clinic at the University of Colorado Medical Center,
and Dr. Helen Glaser, assistant professor of pediatrics at the
university, was no doubt the first scientific research on the
recreational aspects of glue-sniffing in the history of the
medical sciences. </p>

<p>Dr. Massengale explained that he became interested in
glue-sniffing way back in 1960, when early newspaper reports of
glue-sniffing hazards had appeared. A mother almost in tears, he
recalled, had brought her son to his office. &quot;He's sniffing
glue,&quot; the mother declared. &quot;You've got to stop him
before he dies.&quot; A reporter for a Denver paper, in an
interview with Drs. Massengale and Glaser published April 29,
1962, cited these researchers as authority for the statement that
some types of plastic cement &quot;may cause damage to the liver,
kidneys and brain.&quot; 12 When the full text of the
Glaser-Massengale study was published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association for July 28, 1962, however, certain
details were added that the newspaper interview had neglected.
Cases of damage from glue all involved either the swallowing of
substantial amounts or else the continuous dayafter-day exposure
to high concentrations among workers in industrial plants.
&quot;Although a great deal of concern about the ill effects of
this practice is expressed by parents, school personnel, juvenile
authorities, and the children themselves,&quot; the medical
experts noted in the medical publication, &quot;very little is
actually known about possible damage to organ systems resulting
from deliberate inhalation of cement vapors. Many children share
the so far unsubstantiated belief that glue-sniffing produces
insanity and death, and we know of one case in which glue was
first used by an adolescent boy in an attempt to commit
suicide.&quot; 13 Drs. Glaser and Massengale then presented six
cases of juvenile Denver glue-sniffers. In none of them was any
physical damage attributable to glue-sniffing; and in none of
them was glue-sniffing the source of the child's psychological
problems. Case Number 1, for example, concerned an
eleven-year-old boy; &quot;his mother worked at night; his
parents were separated; and he had not seen his father for six
years.&quot; The mother of Case Number 2 &quot;was an alcoholic
and was possibly also psychotic. The parents were separated, and
the patient lived in a foster home, where he was unhappy.... He
was ... depressed, anxious, and fearful, and longing for
affectional security. Seeing the world as hostile and
pain-inflicting, he tended to withdraw into passive, immature
forms of behavior.&quot; Patient Number 3 was a fourteen-year-old
whose father had died when he was five, &quot;and he had been
taken out of the custody of his alcoholic mother but subsequently
had been returned to her. A few months before being seen in the
clinic the boy bad spent eight months in a reformatory because of
stealing.&quot; Case Number 5 was the boy who tried to commit
suicide by sniffing glue. &quot;This boy's father, possibly
acting out of a cultural pattern of insecurity and fear, was very
strict and rigid and was looked upon by the patient as a tyrant.
His mother was a weak, inadequate </p>

<p>person who sided with her son but was unable to rebel against
her husband in his behalf.&quot; Case Number 6 was a
fifteen-year-old; &quot;the patient's father, who had been very
strict and punitive, had died about six months before, and the
mother was finding her son increasingly unmanageable and
destructive. This boy had been in trouble even before his
father's death because of writing obscenities in school books,
running away, and joy-riding.&quot; 14 In all cases, the child's
problems and disturbances had antedated the glue-sniffing. just
what good was accomplished by arresting and incarcerating these
troubled youngsters for sniffing glue did not appear in the
study. It should be noted, moreover, that these were not typical
glue-sniffers. Rather they were typical of the small subsample of
glue-sniffers who were caught at it-arrested by the police and
referred to the university's adolescent clinic. The
Glaser-Massengale paper in the Journal of the American Medical
Association confirmed the incredible speed with which
glue-sniffing had spread following the first accounts in the mass
media: &quot;Glue sniffing, almost unheard of two years ago, has
become a serious threat in some communities. In the Denver area
it is considered by responsible juvenile authorities to be the
most serious problem they face currently in working with known
delinquents and other youngsters brought to the attention of the
court because of violations of the law.&quot;' The 130 Denver
children arrested in the two-year period for glue-sniffing
&quot;ranged in age from 7 through 17, with a mean age of 13
years, and all but 6 were boys.&quot;&quot; Eighty percent bad
Spanish surnames; this high incidence was perhaps due as much to
the arresting practices of the police as to the frequency of
glue-sniffing among those children. Glue-sniffing children in
middle-class white neighborhoods are customarily seen by
pediatricians in private practice. The remainder of the Denver
story need here be only briefly summarized through selected
newspaper items: </p>

<p>&#149; January 18, 1965: Legislation introduced to ban
glue-sniffing.&quot; &#149; March 21, 1965: juvenile court lays
plans for preventive approach to glue-sniffing.&quot;' * April
22, 1965: Adams County sheriff announces breakup of juvenile
glue-sniffing activities with arrest of nineteen-year-old girl.18
* April 29, 1965: Thirteen-year-old leader of glue-sniffing gang
admits burglaries19 * June 25, 1965: Glue-sniffing charges
against boy will be dismissed if he enlists in armed services
before September 13 .20 * As noted above, however, there was as
yet no law to be violated. </p>

<p>* July 2, 1965: United States Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare makes $85,500 grant to finance study of glue-sniffing
in Denver.21 * January 11, 1966: Thirteen-year-old resident of
county receiving home hangs himself after being scolded for
sniffing glue.22 a May 18, 1966: Twenty-one-year-old jailed after

10, 1966: Three with Spanish surnames sentenced to 30 days each
in County jail after pleading guilty to sniffing glue .24 *
October 30, 1966: An additional $44,923 HEW grant is made to
study glue-sniffing in Denver . . . . 25 </p>

<p>While Denver was in all probability the first city in the
world to suffer a major glue-sniffing epidemic, other cities soon
followed Denver's example. In New York City, for example, the New
York Times ran a story about glue-sniffing on October 6, 1961:
&quot;L.I. Youths Inhale Glue in Model Kits For Narcotic
Effect.&quot; 26 Other New York area newspapersand no doubt radio
and television stations as well-ran similar stories. As in
Denver, the New York stories stressed the hazards of
glue-sniffing. The initial New York Times story, after stating
that youngsters sniff glue to &quot;obtain a feeling of elation
similar to that of narcotics,&quot; and that youngsters who sniff
glue are &quot;found in seemingly drunken stupors,&quot; went on
to cite the Nassau County Health Department as authority for the
warning that toluene, the organic solvent most commonly used in
model airplane glue, &quot;dulls the brain when it is inhaled and
could kill a person. It can cause damage to the liver and bone
marrow if it is taken in small repeated doses. The chemical has
an irritating effect on the lungs and can cause pain, vomiting,
headaches, confusion, and ultimately coma. It can also cause the
heart to beat irregularly and can result in transient euphoria.
The lethal dose is unknown. No fatalities have been
recorded.&quot; These warnings, like the earlier Denver warnings,
seemed to be highly effective lures. Within fifteen months, New
York City police had made 778 arrests for glue-sniffing 27 and
the city authorities were seriously considering proposals to make
glue-sniffing illegal. In 1963, New York City arrests totaled
2,003.28 Many tens of thousands of others, of course, were no
doubt sniffing glue by then without coming to the attention of
the police. Salt Lake City was another city where local news
media publicized glue-sniffing early, and where the glue-sniffing
epidemic had an early start. Twelve boys, aged fourteen to
eighteen, were apprehended there for glue-sniffing and
interviewed in 1962; the interviews were of particular
significance in revealing the way in which glue-sniffing, which a
few years earlier was only one of a number of forms of sniffing,
had become the prime form of sniffing. &quot;Seven of the boys
bad previously inhaled the fumes of other substances, notably the
fumes of gasoline (6 boys), ether, </p>

<p>and nasal inhalers (one each), and one of these boys had been
smoking marijuana.&quot; Glue-sniffing had recently, however, far
outstripped the other sniffings, &quot;to the extent that in one
small town the practice was considered virtually universal among
boys. Girls, as yet, have not been widely involved.&quot; 29
Marijuana smoking did not catch up with glue-sniffing among
children until a major antimarijuana campaign was launched a
little later. The glue interests contributed notably to expanding
the anti-gluesniffing campaign from a local to a nationwide
phenomenon. As early as 1962 the Hobby Industry Association of
America, representing 1,100 industry members, announced that it
was spending $250,000 a year to combat glue-sniffing. &quot;To
help inform communities about the sniffing problem,&quot; the
Wall Street Journal announced on its front page on December 7,
1962, &quot;the Hobby Industry Association has produced a
15-minute color film 'The Scent of Danger,' which it soon will
release to local civic groups. The film describes the harm done
by glue sniffing and mentions other products, such as cleaning
fluid and nail polish, which also contain solvents that can cause
intoxication. It recommends that communities make it illegal to
sniff any substance with an intoxicating effect.&quot; 30 For
this the hobby industry won rewards of two kinds-public approval
for its dedication to the anti-glue-sniffing campaign, and a
marked rise in glue sales during the subsequent years. The early
anti-glue-sniffing laws were remarkable in several respects. One
of the first of them-perhaps the very first-was Ordinance Number
1722, passed by the City of Anaheim, California, on June 6, 1962.
This ordinance made it illegal for any person to &quot;inhale,
breathe, or drink any compound, liquid, chemical, or any
substance known as glue, adhesive cement, mucilage, dope, or
other material or substance or combination thereof, with the
intention of becoming intoxicated, elated, dazed, paralyzed,
irrational or in any manner changing, distorting or disturbing
the eyesight, thinking process, balance, or coordination of such
person .&quot; 31 Whiskey drinking was no doubt illegal under
this ordinance. A Maryland law enacted a little later was not
quite so broad; this statute made it &quot;unlawful for any
person under twenty-one years of age to deliberately smell or
inhale such excessive quantities of any narcotics, drugs, or any
other noxious substances or chemicals containing any ketones,
aldehydes, organic acetates, ether, chlorinated hydrocarbons or
any other substances containing solvents releasing toxic vapors,
as cause conditions of intoxication, inebriation, excitement,
stupefaction, or dulling of the brain and nervous system. . . .
Any person violating this section will be guilty of a misdemeanor
and upon conviction thereof shall be fined . . . . 32 Why
glue-sniffing by adults aged twenty-one or older was exempted
from the Maryland law is not apparent. </p>

<p>Other cities and states passed laws restricting the sale of
glue in various ways-though this approach was opposed by the
Hobby Industry Association. At the beginning of 1968 the
Kupperstein-Susman bibliography listed 13 states and 29 counties
and municipalities that had already passed glue-sniffing laws;
additional states, counties, and municipalities had such laws
under consideration. The national news media contributed notably
to the glue-sniffing campaign. In its issue of February 16, 1962,
for example, the weekly news magazine Time carried an item headed
&quot;The New Kick,&quot; which declared: &quot;The newest kick
is glue-sniffing. A 14-year-old sniffer explains: 'You take a
tube of plastic glue, the kind squares use to make model
airplanes, and you squeeze it all out in a handkerchief, see.
Then you roll up the handkerchief into a sort of tube, put the
end in your mouth and breathe through it. It's simple and it's
cheap. It's quick, too. Man! , &quot; 33 As is customary, the
information about how to get high on glue was accompanied in Time
by ritual warnings-much as crime movies of the era, after
glorifying the heroic criminals, ended with their tragic deaths.
Time quoted Dr. Alan K. Done, director of Salt Lake City's Poison
Control Center, as saying: &quot;I have found definite evidence
of effects on the kidneys from glue sniffing. It is too soon to
know whether this effect is temporary or permanent damage .&quot;
34 Neither Time nor the other media, however, publicized the
findings of Dr. Massengale and his Denver associates indicating
that glue-sniffing did not produce kidney damage in Denver.
Newsweek followed on August 13, 1962, with a story entitled
&quot;The New Addicts.&quot; It began: </p>

<p>You're in outer space. You're Superman. You're floating in
air, seeing double, riding next to God. It's Kicksville. Are
these the fantasies of narcotics addicts on a pop? No. More
disturbingly, these hopped-up reactions are those of teenagers
hooked on goofballs, model airplane glue, and cough medicine.
Across the nation, police last week reported case after case of
this alarming trend.35 </p>

<p>In Miami, Newsweek noted, &quot;a 12-year-old boy, discovered
sniffing airplane glue by his father, snatched up a knife and
threatened to kill him.&quot; A police officer with the Miami
juvenile Bureau was then quoted as commenting: &quot;It's common
for the boys who sniff glue to become belligerent. They are
willing to take on a policeman twice their size.&quot; And
Newsweek added: &quot;Glue sniffers-while not physiologically
addictedcan do equal damage to their systems. Some of the
long-term effects [include] burned-out nose membranes, liver
damage, perforations of the gall bladder, destruction of bone
marrow, blindness, and possible death. But,&quot; Newsweek
cogently went on, &quot;this threat doesn't deter youngsters from
squeezing up to five tubes of glue daily into a paper bag and
breathing the fumes .&quot; 36 Consumer Reports, the magazine of
Consumers Union, also ran a warning against glue-sniffing-a bit
more restrained than the othersin January 1963. &quot;Although
there is as yet no documented evidence . . . &quot; the Consumer
Reports article cautiously noted, &quot;CU's medical consultants
are convinced that the inhalation of sufficient solvent vapors to
produce the mental effects the sniffers seek probably will also
produce damage to the liver, kidneys, respiratory organs, and
possibly other organs as well.&quot; 37 Even the Federal Bureau
of Investigation took a hand in the anti-gluesniffing campaign.
Its FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin for October 1965 carried an
article by Dr. Jacob Sokol, chief physician for the Los Angeles
County Probation Department, entitled &quot;A Sniff of
Death.&quot; The tenor of the article was summarized in the
subhead: &quot;Glue-sniffing-in all its horrifying and alarming
ramifications, mentally, physically, and medically -is discussed
by Dr. Sokol in plain, lay language. His report should be of the
utmost interest to law enforcement officers, parents, teachers,
civic leaders, and all persons concerned with the welfare and
health of young people .&quot; 38 The FBI Bulletin article,
moreover, cited a new argument by Dr. Sokol against
glue-sniffing: </p>

<p>Glue sniffers have described to me bow a number of children,
boys and girls, meet in unoccupied houses where they sniff glue
together and later have sexual relations-both homosexual and
heterosexual. To my knowledge this practice has not, however,
come to the attention of law enforcement agencies. Recently,
while conversing with deputy probation officers, I have been
informed that several episodes of homosexual relations have
occurred between adults and children under the influence of glue.
Some of these sexual perverts are encouraging the children to
sniff glue with the intensions of having homosexual relations
with them.&quot; </p>

<p>just where the &quot;sexual perverts&quot; got this idea of
giving children glue was not discussed; perhaps it was from
reading the anti-glue-sniffing campaigns in the mass media. To
end the glue menace, the FBI Bulletin article recommended seven
measures, including the following: &quot;I. We should arouse
public opinion as to the dangers of this practice.... &quot;7.
Legislation should be passed which would prohibit the sale of
glue containing certain toxic chemicals to persons under 21 years
of age.&quot; 40 One side effect of the anti-glue-sniffing
campaign, which continued throughout the 1960s, calls for special
mention. The campaign produced subtle changes in the relations of
parents and teachers to children. A child was now a suspect to be
spied upon lest he secretly be sniffing glue. Health departments
and other authoritative agencies encouraged this </p>

<p>espionage, and listed the symptoms adults should be on the
alert for: &quot;Parents suspecting or told that their children
have deliberately sniffed glue should take them to a doctor
without delay. &quot;Schoolteachers should note irritability,
inattentiveness, sleeping or loss of consciousness as symptoms of
glue sniffing.&quot; 41 The one voice of reason and common sense
amid the near-hysterical concern with glue-sniffing was found in
the Verhulst-Crotty bulletin issued by the National Clearinghouse
for Poison Control Centers, cited earlier. Summing up the
evidence from the studies of glue-sniffers reviewed by the
authors, the bulletin noted: </p>

<p>By speculation, projection, and imagination, one can ... build
up quite a case for the potential hazards of the repeated
inhalation of organic solvents such as those used in plastic
cements. It behooves us, however, to ascertain facts in this
regard. [One expert] inferred from his contact with a number of
boys who practice glue-sniffing that the boys could and would
give up the practice readily if they were convinced it was
dangerous. At the same time, however, it became evident that the
transparent misinformation or contradictory statements by
authorities concerning the dangers of these practices would be
completely disregarded by these boys and taken as evidence that
none of the information was true. It also became apparent that,
if the boys gave up glue-sniffing, they would take up other
habits which would provide a comparable effect. [One expert]
points out that, in our present state of knowledge, toluene (one
of the more commonly used solvents in plastic cements) is
considerably safer than many other organic solvents.42 </p>

<p>The mass media of the early 1960s were filled with reports of
deaths due to glue-sniffing. The Verhulst-Crotty bulletin tracked
down these reports and found a total of nine alleged
glue-sniffing deaths-each one reported many times. Six of the
nine were not due to glue fumes but to asphyxiation, which
occurred when the victim's head was covered by an airtight
plastic bag. A seventh death was probably also a plastic-bag
case. In an eighth case there was no evidence whatever that the
victim had been sniffing glue before his death, and no toluene
was found at autopsy. The last case was probably not due to
glue-sniffing; the victim had been ill and bad sniffed gasoline.
Thus among tens of thousands of glue-sniffers prior to 1964, no
death due unequivocally to glue vapor had as yet been reported.
The lifesaving advice children needed was not to sniff glue with
their heads in plastic bags. The Verbulst-Crotty bulletin also
reviewed behavioral effects of gluesniffing; children
unquestionably did all sorts of silly and potentially dangerous
things when high on glue much the same things they would have
done if drunk on alcohol. Those bulletins, unfortunately, were
distributed in mimeographed form to only a short list of
recipients. They had no visible effect on the nationwide
anti-glue-sniffing campaign. </p>

<p>The toxicology of recreational solvent-sniffing at this
writing remains very much where it was at the time of the 1964
Verhulst-Crotty summary. No one is prepared to say that
occasional solvent sniffing is safe, and some studies suggest
that frequent sniffing may be moderately harmful. Later in the
decade, it was widely observed that young people paid little or
no attention to dire warnings against the hazards of marijuana
smoking, LSD-using, and other forms of drug use. It seems highly
likely, in retrospect, that the exaggerated warnings against
glue-sniffing were among the factors desensitizing some young
people to drug warnings in general. Most teenagers knew of others
in their own neighborhoods who had sniffed glue repeatedly, and
who did not drop dead or go to the hospital with brain damage,
kidney damage, or liver damage. Children may be ignorant, but
they are not stupid. When the evidence of their own experience
contradicts adult propaganda, they (like sensible adults) rely on
their own experience-and tend to distrust in the future a source
of information which they had found unreliable in the past. The
nationwide anti-glue-sniffing campaign, it should be noted,
preceded the anti-LSD campaign, to be described later, and in
part set the model for it. The anti-LSD campaign, like the
antiglue campaign, featured solemn warnings of dire damage, laws
against LSD, sensational police raids, scientific studies
demonstrating hazards-and an endless bombardment of publicity
concerning all of these other factors. Both campaigns were
followed by increased use of the drugs attacked. There was also
one difference. In the case of LSD (see Chapter 50), the drug was
popularized through the simultaneous efforts of LSD enthusiasts
and LSD enemies. But glue-sniffing had no Timothy Leary to
advertise and praise it. The enemies of glue-sniffing popularized
the custom all by themselves. At the beginning of the decade,
gasoline sniffing was the most common form of organic solvent
inhalation. Paint-thinner sniffing, varnish-remover sniffing,
cigarette-lighter-fluid sniffing, glue-sniffing, and the others
were not-very-common phenomena to which no one paid much
attention. So far as can be determined, gasoline sniffing at the
end of the 1960s was neither more nor less popular than at the
beginning. The same was true of the sniffing of other readily
available organic solvents. Only glue-sniffing was the target of
a nationwide campaign-and only gluesniffing became a popular
youth pastime. It seems clear that the damage done by the arrests
and imprisonments of children for glue-sniffing during the 1960s
far exceeded the damage done by glue-sniffing during that sorry
decade-and served to popularize rather than to discourage the
practice. Just how popular it became, many recent surveys reveal.
</p>

<p>In 1969, 1,348 high-school seniors in Montgomery County,
Maryland, filled out a drug-use questionnaire. Of these, 7.4
percent stated that they had sniffed glue, and 1.0 percent
described themselves as current gluesniffers. Similarly, among
1,429 Montgomery County junior-high-school students, 6.6 percent
reported that they had sniffed glue.43 Among 781 sophomores,
juniors, and seniors in five high schools in Madison, Wisconsin,
filling out a questionnaire in 1969, 5.1 percent stated that they
had sniffed glue. The replies indicated that 0.8 percent sniffed
glue frequently, 1.0 percent sniffed glue infrequently, and the
remaining 3.3 percent had sniffed glue only once or twice .44
Among 47,182 students in Utah high schools and junior highs
answering a questionnaire in 1969, 7.1 percent reported that they
had at some time sniffed glue; 9.5 percent of the boys and 4.8
percent of the girls had sniffed. Among the boys, 3.5 percent had
sniffed only once, 3.8 percent had sniffed several times, and 2.2
percent had sniffed more than 10 times. The returns indicated
that 1.8 percent of the boys and 0.9 percent of the girls had
sniffed glue within the past few weeks.45 Among 1,379 high-school
seniors in 11 selected Michigan high schools in 1968, 8.1 percent
in one school reported glue-sniffing, as compared with 7.0
percent in another, 4.7 percent in a third, and none at all in
two small high schools.46 Among 1,225 students at Mamaroneck (New
York) Senior High School answering a questionnaire in 1967, 6.1
percent reported having sniffed glue and 2.0 percent had sniffed
glue more than once. Among 1,294 Mamaroneck junior High School
students, 8.3 percent reported having sniffed glue, and 1.4
percent had sniffed glue more than once .47 These and other
similar surveys suggest that at a rough estimate, at least 5
percent of all young Americans graduating from high school
perhaps 150,000 in each annual cohort-have sniffed glue at least
once. This level of use can be contrasted with the level before
1959, when glue sniffing was essentially unknown and
unpublicized. </p>

<p>On July 20, 1971, the New York Times heralded yet another
nationwide campaign against yet another inhalant menace with a
front-page headline: </p>

<p>AEROSOL SNIFFING: NEW AND DEADLY CRAZE </p>

<p>The story, by Grace Lichtenstein, echoed closely the kickoff
of the antiglue-sniffing campaign a decade earlier:
&quot;Physicians, government officials, drug experts and chemical
manufacturers are growing increasingly worried about a deadly and
relatively new drug-abuse problem among the nation's children:
the inhalation of aerosol sprays.&quot; As in the earlier stories
about glue-sniffing, precise details were sup- </p>

<p>plied on how to get high on aerosols: &quot;The aerosol
product-hair spray, deodorant, household cleaners or some
other-is sprayed into a paper bag or balloon and then inhaled
because the propellant produces a strange, floating kind of
high.&quot; There followed the usual warnings of disastrous
effects: </p>

<p>According to the Food and Drug Administration, more than 100
youths have died from deliberate aerosol sniffing since 1967,
with an average of four deaths a month currently being recorded.
. . . It appears that death occurs after a youngster deeply
inhales an aerosol spray for a prolonged period, either on a
single occasion or on several occasions. The fluorocarbon
propellant Freon, the best-known brand of fluorocarbon, can make
the heart beat irregularly and then stop. </p>

<p>An expert was quoted as adding: &quot;Once the final event
begins, it's quick, sudden, and irreversible.&quot; 48 </p>

<p>An earlier round of aerosol inhaling by children, the story
noted, had centered around a spray-on product used to chill
cocktail glasses. This product had therefore been removed from
the market. Little was accomplished, however, for &quot;experts
stress that any of the 300 kinds of aerosol products now on the
market can be equally abused because all use similar
propellants.&quot; Like the glue industry in the earlier
glue-sniffing campaign, the aerosol industry entered the
aerosol-sniffing campaign through an &quot;Inter-Industry
Committee on Aerosol Use.&quot; &quot;The campaign includes a
filmstrip, 'Rap On,' that has been distributed to 3,000 school
districts. The industry has also put out a booklet, 'Will Death
Come Without Warning?' which declares that aerosol products are
safe when used as directed.&quot; &quot;They're really trying
awfully hard,&quot; said B. J. Burkett, spokesman for the
Inter-Industry Committee and public relations manager of the
Freon Products Division of E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.
There was as yet no suggestion that aerosol sniffing be made a
criminal offense; but laws were being proposed to require a
warning-perhaps even a skull-and-crossbones-on the label of all
aerosol products. Such measures, however, had been decided
against as of this writing. But, one might wonder: Here we go
again?' </p>

<p>* The first effort to repress the recreational use of nitrous
oxide (laughing gas) was also instituted in 1971. Psychiatric
News reported: &quot;Strict regulations have been placed on the
distribution and sale of nitrous oxide in Maryland by Dr. Neil
Solomon, state following reports that the gas is being used by
some young people as an inhalant to produce an exhilarating
effect. This is the first regulatory action in the nation
concerning improper use of nitrous oxide, according to
information from the Food and Drug Administration. . . .&quot; 49

<p><b>The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs</b> </p>

<p><b>Chapter 12 </b></p>

<p><font size="5"><b>The &quot;heroin overdose&quot; mystery and
other occupational hazards of addiction</b></font> </p>

<p><img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562"
height="19"><br>
</p>

<p>Chapter 4 of this Report reviewed in detail the effects of
heroin and other opiates on addicts, including deleterious
physiological effects traceable to the drugs themselves.
Narcotics addicts today face other physiological hazards that are
traceable to the narcotics laws, to the adulteration,
contamination, and exorbitant black-market prices that those laws
foster, and to other legal and social (as distinct from
pharmacological) factors. Dr. Jerome H. Jaffe has described some
of these risks in Goodman and Gilman's textbook (1970):
&quot;Undoubtedly, the high cost and impurities of illicit drugs
in the United States exact their toll. The high incidence of
venereal disease reflects the occupational hazard of the many
females who earn their drug money through prostitution. The
average annual death rate among young, adult heroin addicts is
several times higher than that for nonaddicts of similar age and
ethnic backgrounds. . . . The suicide rate among adult addicts is
likewise considerably higher than that of the general
population.&quot; 1 </p>

<p>Because &quot;the preferred route of administration is
intravenous,&quot; Dr. Jaffe continues, &quot;there is sharing of
implements of injection and a failure to employ hygienic
technics, with a resultant high incidence of endocarditis, and
hepatitis, and other infections.&quot; 2 </p>

<p>The exorbitant price of black-market heroin, Dr. Jaffe might
have added, is one of the factors that makes intravenous
injection &quot;the preferred route of administration,&quot; for
&quot;mainlining&quot; is the cheapest way to forestall
withdrawal symptoms. And the laws restricting possession of
injection equipment, under penalty of imprisonment, increase the
risk of needleborne infections by encouraging the sharing of
implements. </p>

<p>There remains to be considered yet another risk of heroin
addiction, the most publicized hazard of all-death from
&quot;heroin overdose.&quot; Because these deaths are a source of
such widespread concern, and also because they are so widely
misunderstood, even by authorities on heroin addiction and by
addicts themselves, we shall examine the data in detail. Much of
the discussion that follows is focused on New York City, since
the deaths attributed to heroin overdose are most numerous there
and since the New York City data are published in convenient
form. </p>

<p>&quot;Prior to 1943, there were relatively few deaths among
addicts from overdosage. &quot; 3 By the 1950s, however, nearly
half of all deaths among New York City addicts were being
attributed to &quot;acute reaction to dosage or overdosage
.&quot; 4 In 1969, about 70 percent of all New York addict deaths
were assigned the &quot;overdose&quot; labels and in 1970, the
proportion was about 80 percent.- The number of deaths so
designated by New York City's Office of the Chief Medical
Examiner increased from very few or none at all before 1943 to
about 800 in 1969 and 1970 .7 </p>

<p>During this same twenty-eight-year span, addict deaths from
all other causes-infections, violence, suicide, and so
on-increased very little. The enormous increase in number of
deaths among addicts shown in Figure 2 was attributed almost
entirely to &quot;overdose&quot; deaths. </p>

<p>The number of deaths throughout the United States attributed
to heroin overdose from 1943 to date must total many thousands.
In New York City it was reported that narcotics, chiefly heroin,
were the leading cause of death in 1969 and 1970 in all males
aged fifteen to tbirty-five,8 including nonaddicts. This can
properly be characterized as an epidemic; the general alarm over
these deaths is thoroughly warranted. </p>

<p>There are two relatively simple ways, however, to prevent
deaths from heroin overdose. </p>

<p>First, addicts can be warned to take only their usual dose of
heroin rather than risking death by taking too much. </p>

<p>Second, even in cases where an addict takes a vastly excessive
dose despite the warning, death usually can be readily prevented,
for death from an overdose of opiates is ordinarily a slow
process. &quot;in cases of fatal poisoning with morphine, the
time of death may vary roughly from one to twelve hours.&quot; 9
The first signs are lethargy and stupor, followed by prolonged
coma. If, after a period of hours, death does ensue, it is
usually from respiratory failure. During the minutes or hours
following the injection of a potentially fatal overdose, death
can be readily forestalled by administering an effective
antidote: a narcotic antagonist known as nalorpbine (Nalline).10
Nalorphine brings a victim of opiate overdose out of his stupor
or coma within a few minutes. Since there is plenty of time and
since nalorphine is stocked in pharmacies and hospital emergency
rooms throughout the country, the death of anyone due to heroin
overdose is very rarely excusable. </p>

<p>But alas, the two standard precautions against
overdose-warnings against taking too much and administration of
an antidote-are in fact wholly ineffective in the current crisis,
for the thousands of deaths attributed to heroin overdose are not
in fact due to heroin overdose at all. The evidence falls under
three major rubrics. </p>

<p>(1) The deaths cannot be due to overdose. </p>

<p>(2) There has never been any evidence that they are due to
overdose. </p>

<p>(3) There has long been a plethora of evidence demonstrating
that they are not due to overdose. </p>

<p>Let us review these three bodies of data in detail. </p>

<p>(1) Why these deaths cannot be due to overdose. The amount of
morphine or heroin required to kill a human being who is not
addicted to opiates remains in doubt but it is certainly many
times the usual dose (10 milligrams) contained in a New York City
bag. &quot;There is little accurate information,&quot; Drs. A. J.
Reynolds and Lowell 0. Randall report in Morphine and Allied
Drugs (1967). &quot;The figures that have been reported show wide
variation.&quot; 12 This ignorance no doubt stems from the rarity
of morphine or heroin overdose deaths. The amounts of morphine or
heroin needed to kill a nonaddict have been variously estimated
at 120 milligrams (oral),13 200 milligrams, 14 250
milligrams,&quot; and 350 milligrams16-though it has also been
noted that nonaddicts have survived much larger doses .17 The
best experimental evidence comes from Drs. Lawrence Kolb and A.
G. Du Mez of the United States Public Health Service; in 1931
they demonstrated that it takes seven or eight milligrams of
heroin per kilogram of body weight, injected directly into a
vein, to kill unaddicted monkeys.&quot; On this basis, it would
take 500 milligrams or more (50 New York City bags full,
administered in a single injection) to kill an unaddicted human
adult. </p>

<p>Virtually all of the victims whose deaths are falsely labeled
as due to heroin overdose, moreover, are addicts who have already
developed a tolerance for opiates-and even enormous amounts of
morphine or heroin do not kill addicts. In the Philadelphia study
of the 1920s, for example, sonic addicts reported using 28 grains
(1,680 milligrams) of morphine or heroin per day.&quot;' This is
forty times the usual New York City daily dose. In one
Philadelphia experiment, 1,800 milligrams of morphine were
injected into an addict over a two-and-a-half-hour period. This
vast dose didn't even make him sick.20 </p>

<p>Nor does a sudden increase in dosage produce significant side
effects, much less death, among addicts. In the Philadelphia
study, three addicts were given six, seven, and nine times their
customary doses-&quot;mainlined.&quot; Far from causing death,
the drug &quot;resulted in insignificant changes in the pulse and
respiration rates, electrocardiogram, chemical studies of the
blood, and the behavior of the addict.&quot; 21 The addicts
didn't even become drowsy.22 </p>

<p>Recent studies at the Rockefeller Hospital in New York City,
under the direction of Dr. Vincent P. Dole, have confirmed the
remarkable resistance of addicts to overdose. Addicts receiving
daily maintenance doses of 40 milligrams to 80 milligrams of
methadone, a synthetic narcotic (see Chapter 14), were given as
much as 200 milligrams of unadulterated heroin in a single
intravenous injection. They &quot;bad no change in respiratory
center or any other vital organs .&quot; 23 </p>

<p>(2) There is no evidence to show that deaths attributed to
overdose are in fact so caused. Whenever someone takes a
drug-whether strychnine, a barbiturate, heroin, or some other
substance-and then dies without other apparent cause, the
suspicion naturally arises that he may have taken too much of the
drug and and died of poisoning an overdose. To confirm or refute
this suspicion, an autopsy is performed, following a
well-established series of procedures. </p>

<p>If the drug was taken by mouth, for example, the stomach
contents and feces are analyzed in order to identify the drug and
to determine whether an excessive amount is present. If the drug
was injected, the tissues surrounding the injection site are
similarly analyzed. The blood, urine, and other body fluids and
tissues can also be analyzed and the quantity of drug present
determined. </p>

<p>Circumstantial evidence, too, can in some cases establish with
reasonable certainly that someone has died of overdose. If a
Patient fills a prescription for a hundred barbiturate tablets,
for example, and is found dead the next morning with only a few
tablets left in the bottle, death from barbiturate poisoning is a
reasonable hypothesis to be explored. Similarly, if an addict
dies after &quot;shooting up,&quot; and friends who were present
report that he injected many times his usual dose, the
possibility of death from heroin overdose deserves serious
consideration. </p>

<p>Further, in cases where an addict has died following an
injection of heroin, and the syringe he used is found nearby or
still sticking in his vein, the contents of the syringe can be
examined to determine whether it contained heroin of exceptional
strength. And there are other ways of establishing at least a
prima facie case for an overdose diagnosis. </p>

<p>A conscientious search of the United States medical literature
throughout recent decades has failed to turn up a single
scientific paper reporting that heroin overdose, as established
by these or any other reasonable methods of determining overdose,
is in fact a cause of death among American heroin addicts. The
evidence that addicts have been dying by the hundreds of heroin
overdose is simply nonexistent. </p>

<p>At this point the mystery deepens. If even enormous doses of
heroin will not kill an addict, and if there exists no shred of
evidence to indicate that addicts or nonaddicts are in fact dying
of heroin overdose, why is the overdose myth almost universally
accepted? The answer lies in the customs of the United States
coroner-medical examiner system. </p>

<p>Whenever anyone dies without a physician in attendance to
certify the cause of death, it is the duty of the local coroner
or medical examiner to investigate, to have an autopsy performed
if indicated, and then formally to determine and record the cause
of death. The parents, spouse, or children of the dead person can
then ask the coroner for his findings. Newspaper reporters
similarly rely on the coroner or medical examiner to explain a
newsworthy death. No coroner, of course, wants to be in a
position of having to answer &quot;I don't know&quot; to such
queries. A coroner is supposed to know-and if he doesn't know, he
is supposed to find out. </p>

<p>At some point in the history of heroin addiction, probably in
the early 1940s, the custom arose among coroners and medical
examiners of labeling as &quot;heroin overdose&quot; all deaths
among heroin addicts the true cause of which could not be
determined. These &quot;overdose&quot; determinations rested on
only two findings: (1) that the victim was a heroin addict who
&quot;shot up&quot; prior to his death; and (2) that there was no
evidence of suicide, violence, infection, or other natural
cause.24 No evidence that the victim had taken a large dose was
required to warrant a finding of death from overdose. This
curious custom continues today. Thus, in common coroner and
medical examiner parlance, &quot;death from heroin overdose&quot;
is synonymous with &quot;death from unknown causes after
injecting heroin.&quot; </p>

<p>During the 1940s, this custom of convenience did little
apparent harm. Most deaths among heroin addicts were due to
tetanus, bacterial endocarditis, tuberculosis, and other
infections, to violence, or to suicide, and they were properly
labeled as such by coroners and medical examiners. It was only an
occasional death which baffled the medical examiner, and which
was therefore signed out as due to &quot;overdose.&quot; But,
beginning about 1943, a strange new kind of death began to make
its appearance among heroin addicts .25 The cause of this new
kind of death was not known, and remains unknown today-though it
is now quite common. </p>

<p>A striking feature of this mysterious new mode of death is its
suddenness. Instead of occurring after one or more hours of
lethargy, stupor, and coma, as in true overdose cases, death
occurs within a few minutes or less-perhaps only a few seconds
after the drug is injected. Indeed, </p>

<p>11 collapse and death are so rapid,&quot; one authority
reports, &quot;that the syringe was found in the vein of the
victim or on the floor after having dropped out of the vein, and
the tourniquet was still in place on the arm .&quot; 26 This
explains in part why nalorphine and other narcotic antagonists,
highly effective antidotes in true opiate overdose cases, are
useless in the cases falsely labeled overdose. </p>

<p>An even more striking feature of these mysterious deaths is a
sudden and massive flooding of the lungs with fluid: pulmonary
edema. In many cases it is not even necessary to open the lungs
or X-ray them to find the edema; &quot;an abundance of partly
dried frothy white edema fluid [is seen] oozing from the nostrils
or mouth &quot; 27 when the body is first found. Neither of these
features suggests overdose-but since &quot;overdose&quot; has
come to be a synonym for &quot;cause unknown,&quot; and since the
cause of these sudden deaths characterized by lung edema is
unknown, they are lumped under the &quot;overdose&quot; rubric. </p>

<p>Not all of the deaths attributed to heroin overdose are
necessarily characterized by suddenness and by massive pulmonary
edema, but several studies have shown that a high proportion of
all &quot;overdose&quot; deaths share these two
characteristics.28 </p>

<p>(3) Evidence demonstrating that these deaths are not due to
overdose is plentiful. This evidence has been summarized in a
series of scientific papers, beginning in 1966, by New York
City's Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Milton Helpern, and his
associate, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Michael M. Baden.
At a meeting of the Society for the Study of Addiction held in
London in 1966, Dr. Helpern explained that the most conspicuous
feature of so-called &quot;overdose&quot; deaths is the massive
pulmonary edema. When asked the cause of the edema, he cautiously
responded: </p>

<p>This is a very interesting question. To my knowledge it is not
known why the pulmonary edema develops in these cases.... This
reaction sometimes occurs with the intravenous injections of
mixtures, which as far as is known, do not contain any heroin,
but possibly some other substance. The reaction does not appear
to be specific. It does not seem to be peculiar to one substance,
but it is most commonly seen with mixtures in which heroin is the
smallest component. </p>

<p>In a paper published in the New York State Journal of Medicine
for September 15, 1966, Dr. Helpern again cast doubt on the myth
that these deaths are due to overdose. &quot;Formerly such acute
deaths were attributed to overdose of the heroin contained in the
sample injected,&quot; Dr. Helpern reported-but he went on to
cite several lines of evidence arguing against the overdose
theory: </p>

<p>... Unexpected acute deaths may occur in some addicts who
inject themselves with heroin mixtures even though others who
take the same usual . . . dose from the same sample at the same
time may suffer no dangerous effect. In some fatal acute cases,
the rapidity and type of reaction do not suggest overdose alone
but rather an overwhelming shocklike process due to sensitivity
to the injected material. The toxicologic examination of the
tissues in such fatalities, where the reaction was so rapid that
the syringe and needle were still in the vein of the victim when
the body was found, demonstrated only the presence of alkaloid,
not overdosage. In other acute deaths, in which the circumstances
and autopsy findings were positive, the toxicologist could not
even find any evidence of alkaloid in the tissues or body fluids.
Thus, there does not appear to be any quantitative correlation
between the acute fulminating lethal effect and the amount of
heroin taken. . . .30 </p>

<p>Dr. Helpern's associate, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Baden,
went on to further discredit the already implausible overdose
theory at a joint meeting of two American Medical Association
drug-dependency committees held in Palo Alto, California, in
February 1969. </p>

<p>&quot;The majority of deaths,&quot; Dr. Baden told the AMA
physicians, &quot;are due to an acute reaction to the intravenous
injection of the heroin-quinine-sugar mixture. This type of death
is often referred to as an 'overdose,' which is a misnomer. Death
is not due to a pharmacological overdose in the vast majority of
cases.&quot; 31 </p>

<p>At the same AMA committee meeting and at a meeting of the
Medical Society of the County of New York, Dr. Baden cited six
separate lines of evidence overturning the &quot;heroin
overdose&quot; theory. </p>

<p>First, when the packets of heroin found near the bodies of
dead addicts are examined, they do not differ from ordinary
packets. &quot;No qualitative or quantitative differences&quot;
are found.32 This rules out the possibility that some incredibly
stupid processor may have filled a bag with pure heroin instead
of the usual adulterated mix. </p>

<p>Second, when the syringes used by addicts immediately before
dying are examined, the mixture found in them does not contain
more heroin than usual. </p>

<p>Third, when the urine of addicts allegedly dead of overdose is
analyzed, there is no evidence of overdose. </p>

<p>Fourth, the tissues surrounding the site of the fatal
injection show no signs of high heroin concentration. </p>

<p>Fifth, neophytes unaccustomed to heroin rather than addicts
tolerant to opiates would be expected to be susceptible to death
from overdose. But &quot;almost all of those dying&quot; of
alleged overdose, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Baden reported,
&quot;are long-term users.&quot; </p>

<p>Sixth, again according to Dr. Baden, &quot;addicts often
'shoot' in a group, all using the same heroin supply, and rarely
does more than one addict die at such a time.&quot; 33 </p>

<p>These definitive refutations of the heroin overdose theory
should, of course, have led to two prompt steps: a warning to
addicts that something other than overdose is causing these
hundreds of addict deaths annually -and an intensive search for
the true cause of the deaths. But neither of these steps has been
taken. Hence the news media go right on talking about
&quot;heroin overdose&quot; deaths. &quot;Death from acute
reaction to heroin overdose&quot; and other complicated phrases
are also used; these phrases similarly conceal the fact that
these deaths are not due to overdose. </p>

<p>How can the &quot;heroin overdose&quot; myth not only survive
but flourish even after these repeated scientific debunkings? Two
stenographic transcripts provide an answer. </p>

<p>The first is the transcript of a press conference held at the
Rockefeller University on October 27, 1969, in connection with
the Second National Conference on Methadone Treatment. In the
course of his remarks to the assembled reporters, Deputy Chief
Medical Examiner Baden there discussed at some length a case of
what he described as an &quot;addict who died of an overdose of
heroin.&quot; 34 The reporters present naturally referred
thereafter to this death as a &quot;heroin overdose&quot; case. </p>

<p>At the scientific meeting held in the same room on the same
day, however, Dr. Baden described the same death in quite
different terms. To the scientists he stated that the addict in
question &quot;died of acute reaction to injection of heroin, a
so-called overdose.&quot; When even this description was
challenged by a fellow physician, who pointed out that addicts
don't die following even enormous doses,35 Dr. Baden went on to
explain that whenever I say 'overdose,' it is in quotation
marks.&quot; 36 </p>

<p>The reporters, of course, could not see those invisible
quotation marks when they listened to Dr. Baden at his press
conferences and interviews. They quite naturally took him
literally-and continued to inform the public that addicts were
dying of overdose.* </p>

<p>Even Chief Medical Examiner Helpern eventually became
convinced that the &quot;heroin overdose&quot; publicity
emanating from his office was &quot;dangerously wrong.&quot; In
testimony before the Select Committee on Crime of the United
States House of Representatives on June 27, 1970, Dr. Helpern
stated: </p>

<p>A difficulty has been that people have considered these fatal
reactions the result of overdose. Now, to some people the
designation overdose means [taking] more than usual with the
implication that if you are careful of how much is taken there is
no danger of anything other than the usual effect. This
impression which many addicts have is dangerously wrong. 38 </p>

<p>Yet a full year after Dr. Helpern testified, neither he nor
Dr. Baden nor anyone else had yet ventured to correct the
&quot;dangerously wrong&quot; view that was being foisted on the
New York and national news media. Almost everyone who did not
read Dr. Helpern's and Dr. Baden's papers in the medical journals
still believed that heroin addicts by the hundreds were dying of
overdose. Worse yet, nobody had as yet even begun to investigate
seriously the crucial question: If these hundreds of addicts a
year aren't dying of overdose, what are they dying of? </p>

<p>Fortunately, enough is already known to suggest some promising
directions for immediate research. </p>

<p>Most deaths from so-called overdose, as noted above, are
characterized by suddenness and by pulmonary edema. No other
cause of death-such as tetanus, bacterial endocarditis,
hepatitis, or a knife or gunshot wound -is found. In
approximately 60 percent of autopsies, a 1970 study indicates,
there is also cerebral edema (accumulation of fluid in the brain)
along with widespread fragmentation of the astrocytes
(star-shaped cells) in the brain.39 A death with these
characteristics, occurring in a heroin addict, constitutes a
dramatic and readily identifiable syndrome which Dr. Helpern has
called &quot;acute fatal reaction to the intravenous injection of
crude mixtures of heroin and other substances.&quot; We shall
here apply a less cumbersome label: &quot;Syndrome X.&quot; </p>

<p>1 Thus in the New York Times for December 16, 1969, a reporter
was led to state without qualification: &quot;About 800 addicts
of all ages died this year from overdoses, according to Dr.
Baden.&quot; 37<br>
</p>

<p>One clue to the true cause of Syndrome X is its initial
appearance about 1943, its relative rarity for the next few
years, and its recent rapid increase in frequency. The time
sequence obviously suggests that the cause of Syndrome X must be
some factor introduced about 1943 and affecting a vastly
increased number of addicts during 1969 and 1970. Heroin clearly
does not qualify; it was widely used long before 1943. Indeed, a
highly significant fact about Syndrome X is that it has become
more and more frequent as the amount of heroin in the New York
City bag has gone down and down. These deaths are, if anything,
associated with &quot;underdose&quot; rather than overdose. </p>

<p>One theory sometimes advanced is that Syndrome X deaths are
caused by the quinine in the bag. Quinine was introduced as an
adulterant of heroin sometime after 1939, when an epidemic of
malaria spread by contaminated injection needles hit New York
City addicts 40 thus the time of introduction fits the Syndrome X
timetable. Some addicts discovered that the quinine contributed
to the sensation known as a &quot;rush&quot; immediately after
injection. Heroin traffickers also discovered that the bitter
taste of the quinine makes it impossible for addicts to gauge the
concentration of heroin in the bag by tasting the mixture. For
these and possibly other reasons, quinine has remained a standard
adulterant of New York City heroin ever since. </p>

<p>Perhaps the first suggestion that quinine might be causing New
York City's Syndrome X deaths came from Dr. F. E. Camps, the
United Kingdom Home Office pathologist in charge of investigating
opiate deaths in England. At a conference of the Society for the
Study of Addiction held in London in September 1966 (which Chief
Medical Examiner Helpern attended), Dr. Camps stated: &quot;The
only comparable drug to heroin which causes rapid death with
pulmonary oedema is quinine. In this case patients start off with
discomfort in their chest, and then rapidly die. It is
conceivable that this could have some relation to [New York City]
heroin deaths .&quot; 41 </p>

<p>At the same conference an American pathologist, the late Dr.
Rudolph J. Muelling of the University of Kentucky Medical School,
added that a type of lung lesion similar to that found in
Syndrome X deaths &quot;is found to occur when one studies pure
quinine cases. In the United States this kind of lesion has been
found in several nurses attempting to induce abortions on
themselves. They take the quinine orally and the condition comes
on quite rapidly. The patients die of quinine alone.&quot; 42 </p>

<p>A second possible cause of Syndrome X deaths can best be
illustrated by two examples. </p>

<p>One is the case of &quot;C. G.,&quot; a heroin addict long
accustomed to mainlining his drug, who one day got drunk, took
his &quot;customary injection of heroin and collapsed shortly
thereafter.&quot; Subsequent X-rays showed lung edema.43 </p>

<p>Another is the case of a heroin addict whose death was
recently reported by Dr. George R. Gay and his associates at the
Haight-Ashbury Medical Clinic, San Francisco. This addict first
&quot;shot some reds&quot; (that is, barbiturates) and then
&quot;fixed&quot; with heroin following the barbiturates. He died
of what was diagnosed as &quot;overdose of heroin .&quot; 44 </p>

<p>Cases such as these have given rise to the question whether
Syndrome X deaths may result from injecting heroin (with or
without quinine) into a body already laden with a
central-nervous-system depressant such as alcohol or a
barbiturate. </p>

<p>Addicts themselves would seem to deserve credit for first
suspecting that so-called &quot;heroin overdose&quot; deaths
might in fact result from the combined action of alcohol and
heroin. Back in 1958, a team headed by Dr. Ray E. Trussell and
Mr. Harold Alksne interviewed more than 200 New York City
addicts-alumni of the Riverside Hospital addiction treatment
program (see Chapter 10). In this as in other pre-1960 studies,
few addicts drank alcohol while on heroin, and they did not drink
much. When asked why, the addicts commonly gave two reasons. </p>

<p>One was that the effect of alcohol is &quot;offensive&quot; to
a man on heroin. &quot;The narcotic alone has an analgesic effect
which tends to quiet the individual. Alcohol, on the other hand
... has the capacity to agitate the individual in his
relationships with other people. This generally is offensive to
the addict.&quot; 45 </p>

<p>The other reason given by addicts in 1958 for not drinking
while on heroin is the first extant clue to the possible
relationship between alcohol and death from &quot;heroin
overdose.&quot; Addicts, the Trussell-Alksne team noted,
&quot;believe that the use of narcotics and alcohol in
combination is dangerous and might possibly lead to the death of
an individual.&quot; 46 By the 1960s, this awareness of the
hazard of shooting heroin while drunk had disappeared from the
addict scene. Addicts, like others, were evidently convinced by
the official announcements that those deaths were indeed due to
heroin overdose. </p>

<p>If the theory is sound that even an ordinary dose of an opiate
injected while drunk can produce death, then death could occur
when an ordinary drunk who is not addicted is brought into a
hospital emergency room with a painful injury and is given a
routine (10 milligram) injection of morphine to ease his pain.
Drs. William B. Deichmann and Horace W. Gerarde report in their
Toxicology of Drugs and Chemicals (1969 edition) that death may
in fact occur under such conditions. </p>

<p>&quot;The ordinary safe therapeutic dose of morphine,&quot;
they warn, in italics, in their textbook, &quot;may be fatal to
persons who have been drinking alcoholic beverages. Morphine in
therapeutic doses [similar to the doses commonly injected by
addicts] resulted in fatalities in individuals whose blood
alcohol levels ranged from 0.22 to 0.27%. Morphine is also
synergistic with barbiturates and related drugs.&quot; 47 Thus
the hazard of death from shooting an opiate while drunk on
alcohol or a barbiturate is familiar to some toxicologists even
though it has been ignored by authorities on drug addiction-and
by coroners and medical examiners-through the years. </p>

<p>If this alcohol-heroin and barbiturate-heroin explanation is
correct, the fact is of the utmost practical importance-for
hundreds of deaths a year might be prevented by warning addicts
not to shoot heroin while drunk on alcohol or barbiturates. </p>

<p>The alcohol-barbiturate hypothesis fits the Syndrome X time
schedule. Throughout the nineteenth century and well into the
twentieth, opiate addicts were known for their dislike of alcohol
while on opiates. As noted earlier, they turned to alcohol only
when deprived of their opiate supply or when trying to &quot;kick
the habit.&quot; This remains generally true today; an addict
rarely drinks while on heroin. He often drinks, however, when his
heroin supply runs out and withdrawal symptoms set in. During
World War 11, many heroin addicts were abruptly deprived of their
heroin supply for longer or shorter periods. If some of them
turned to alcohol, then connected with a fresh heroin supply and
&quot;shot up&quot; while still drunk, the first few identified
Syndrome X deaths might have occurred. The recent sharp increase
in Syndrome X deaths might similarly be explained by an increased
tendency to alternate alcohol or barbiturates with heroin as a
result of high heroin prices. As the amount of heroin in the New
York City bag went down and down, according to this theory, more
and more addicts got drunk-and died of Syndrome X following their
next &quot;fix.&quot; </p>

<p>Evidence in recent years for the use of alcohol by addicts
shortly before their death has been assembled from the New York
City files by Drs. Jane McCusker and Charles E. Cherubin. They
reviewed 588 city toxicology reports found in the files on
addicts who died in 1967. In 549 of these cases, tests for
alcohol had been run-and in 43 percent of the cases tested,
alcohol was in fact found .48 (Barbiturates were not reported
on.) Their findings led Drs. McCusker and Cherubin to suggest
that further research be promptly launched into the possible role
of alcohol and the barbiturates in so-called &quot;heroin
overdose&quot; cases. </p>

<p>The same suggestion has been tentatively made by Dr. Gay of
the Haight-Ashbury Medical Clinic. Thirty-seven percent of the
addicts attending the clinic, Dr. Gay states, report using
barbiturates &quot;for sedation and sleep&quot; when heroin
withdrawal symptoms set in; and 24 percent report using alcohol
similarly.49 Thus the stage is set for shooting heroin while
drunk on one or the other-and, perhaps, for sudden death from
overdose.&quot; </p>

<p>Two of the most publicized &quot;overdose deaths&quot; of
1970, Dr. Gay informed the National Heroin Conference in June
1971, fit precisely this pattern. These were the deaths of the
rock musician Jimi Hendrix and the singer Janis Joplin. Hendrix
was known to use both alcohol and barbiturates-and possibly also
heroin. Janis Joplin &quot;drank [alcohol] like an F. Scott
Fitzgerald legend,&quot; Dr. Gay adds-and also used narcotics.50
The magazine Time reported on October 19, 1970, shortly after
Janis Joplin's death: </p>

<p>The quart bottle of Southern Comfort [whiskey] that she held
aloft onstage was at once a symbol of her load and a way of
lightening it. As she emptied the bottle, she grew happier, more
radiant, and more freaked out.... </p>

<p>Last week, on a day that superficially at least seemed to be
less lonely than most, Janis Joplin died on the lowest and
saddest of notes. Returning to her Hollywood motel room after a
late-night recording session and some hard drinking with friends
at a nearby bar, she apparently filled a hypodermic needle with
heroin and shot it into her left arm. The injection killed her.51
</p>

<p>Janis Joplin's death, of course, was popularly attributed to
&quot;heroin overdose.&quot; If the alcohol-barbiturate-heroin
theory is correct, her fatal injection of heroin while drunk on
alcohol was the prototype of many other deaths similarly
mislabeled &quot;overdose.&quot; </p>

<p>The British experience with deaths attributed to heroin
overdose is consistent with the alcohol-barbiturate hypothesis.
Dr. Ramon Gardner of the Bethlem Royal Hospital and Maudsley
Hospital in London studied the records of 170 deaths known to
have occurred among addicts in Britain during the five-year
period 1965 through 1969. Twenty of these deaths were deemed
suicides, 24 were traceable to infections, 12 were from natural
causes, 11 were drownings, falls, murders, or other accidents,
and 6 occurred during treatment (of which two followed abrupt
withdrawal of narcotics when the addicts were imprisoned). Eight
more were due to overdose of barbiturates or other nonopiate
drugs. This left a maximum of 89 mysterious deaths out of 170
which might have been caused by accidental opiate overdose-or by
something else.52 </p>

<p>Dr. Gardner then went on to study in more detail 47 of these
deaths possibly due to heroin overdose. In a number of cases, he
found that the addicts bad been confined in a hospital, prison,
or detention center or had for other reasons been abstinent from
opiates for a week or longer, and had thus lost at least a
portion of their tolerance for opiates. They had then injected an
opiate-some of them on the day of discharge, others within the
next day or two. Thus these deaths might have been due to
overdose-though evidence was lacking that the victims had in fact
taken fatally large doses. (Merely doubling or quadrupling the
dose, it will be recalled, will not kill even nonaddicts.) </p>

<p>But in at least 21 of the 47 cases, there had been no
withdrawal from opiates prior to death, so that tolerance had not
been lost. And in some cases, the dose preceding death was so
small-as little as 20 or 30 milligrams of heroin, for example-as
to establish beyond question that overdose was not the cause .53 </p>

<p>These British deaths, accordingly, remain mysterious, like
deaths from Syndrome X in the United States. Among several likely
explanations, Dr. Gardner himself noted, is the possibility that
these addicts may have taken some other drug, perhaps a
central-nervous-system depressant, at the same time. Since there
is no quinine in British opiates, that drug must be exonerated in
the British deaths. </p>

<p>Another British drug authority adds that in Britain as in the
United States, &quot;many of those who die, in fact, have taken
barbiturates as well [as opiates] at the same time.&quot; 54 </p>

<p>It might prove absurdly easy to confirm the
alcohol-barbiturate hypothesis. All that might be necessary would
be to addict a few monkeys or other primates to heroin,
intoxicate them on alcohol or barbiturates, and then inject
modest doses of heroin. If the monkeys drop dead of Syndrome X, a
warning against shooting heroin while drunk on alcohol or
barbiturates might save many hundreds of lives a year throughout
the world. </p>

<p>Several other possible explanations of Syndrome X deaths have
been offered. No theory has yet been proved. Worse yet, no theory
has ever been experimentally tested. The time has surely come to
determine the cause (or causes) of Syndrome X and bring to a
close this tragic series of deaths. If 800 respectable citizens
instead of heroin addicts had dropped dead in New York City of a
mysterious syndrome in 1970, a gargantuan research program would
no doubt have been promptly launched. </p>

<p>If the Syndrome X deaths are due to quinine or to any other
adulterant or contaminant in the bag, the responsibility clearly
rests with the American heroin black market for selling unsafe
mixes. If the cause of these deaths is the shooting of heroin
while drunk on alcohol or barbiturates, the black-market
distribution system remains at least indirectly responsible, for
it is largely the high cost of black-market heroin that makes
heroin users turn to alcohol and barbiturates on occasion-and
thus, perhaps, to risk death from Syndrome X. </p>

<p>The two steps which must now be taken are (1) to stop sweeping
these mysterious deaths under the carpet by falsely labeling them
&quot;overdose&quot; and (2) to launch an intensive clinical and
experimental search for what is in fact killing these addicts. <br>

<p> Substance abuse and addiction are complex phenomena that defy
simple explanation or description. A tangled interaction of
factors contribute to an individual's seeking out, use, and
perhaps subsequent abuse of drugs. Since more individuals
experiment with drugs than eventually develop substance abuse
problems, great interest persists in understanding what
differentiates these groups. Factors that can play a role in drug
abuse susceptibility include a person's psychological makeup
(e.g., self-esteem, propensity to take risks, impulsivity,
depression), biological response to drugs, environmental
situation (e.g., peer groups, family organization, socioeconomic
status), and the availability of drugs. The exact combination of
elements that lead to substance abuse varies among individuals. <br>
</p>

<p> Underlying all substance use, abuse and addiction are the
actions and effects that drugs of abuse exert. For a complete
understanding of drug abuse and addiction one must address how
drugs affect the brain, why certain drugs have the potential for
being abused, and what, if any, biological differences exist
among individuals in their susceptibility to abuse drugs. While
many other factors ultimately contribute to an individual's
drug-taking behavior, understanding the biological components is
crucial in understanding substance abuse, addiction, and
dependency.<br>
</p>

<p> Two biological factors contribute to substance use, abuse,
and addiction: the effects drugs of abuse exert on a person; and
the biological status of the individual taking drugs. The former
relates to the acute mechanisms of action of drugs in the brain
and the long-term effects that occur after chronic exposure. The
latter pertains to an individual's biological constitution, most
importantly the presence of inherited characteristics that affect
that person's response to a drug.<br>
</p>

<p> The biological mechanisms of substance abuse are complex and
interactive. A previously published background paper by the
Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) entitled Biological
Components of Substance Abuse and Addiction thoroughly discusses
the basic concepts, neuropharmacology, and genetics of drug
abuse. This chapter is a synopsis of the background paper.<br>
</p>

<p> DRUG ACTION <br>
</p>

<p> Acute Actions <br>
</p>

<p> Drugs of abuse alter the brain's normal balance and level of
biochemical activity (see box 3-1). In order to have these
affects, a drug must first reach the brain. This is accomplished
by the drug diffusing from the circulatory system into the brain.
The routes of administration, methods by which a drug enters the
bloodstream, affect how quickly a drug penetrates the brain. The
chemical structure of a drug plays an important role in the
ability of a drug to cross from the circulatory system into the
brain. The four main routes of administration for drugs of abuse
are oral, nasal, intravenous, and inhalation. With oral
ingestion, the drug must be absorbed by the stomach or gut which
results in a delay before effects become apparent. When the nasal
route of administration is used, effects are usually felt within
3 minutes, as the capillary rich mucous membranes of the nose
rapidly absorb substances into the bloodstream. Intravenous
administration usually produces effects in 1/2 to 2 minutes and
is slowed only by the detour back through the lungs that venous
blood must take to reach the brain. Lastly, the inhalation method
bypasses the venous system completely because the drug is
absorbed into the pulmonary circulation which goes directly from
the lungs to the heart and then to the brain. As a result,
effects are felt within 5 to 10 seconds, making inhalation the
fastest route of administration. The route of administration can
determine the drug's potency and the efficacy the drug will have
on affecting brain activity, thereby contributing to the abuse
potential of the drug.<br>
</p>

<p> Distinct from other psychoactive agents, drugs of abuse, in
part, affect those areas of the brain that mediate feelings of
pleasure and reward (see box 3-2). Evidence is accumulating that
positive sensations experienced during these activities are
mediated by the brain reward system. Studies have shown that
direct stimulation of the areas of the brain involved in the
reward system, in the absence of any goal-seeking behavior,
produces extreme pleasure that has strong reinforcing properties
in its own right (48,60). Animals with electrodes implanted in
these areas in such a way that electrical impulses produce a
pleasurable sensation will repeatedly press a bar, or do any
other required task, to receive electrical stimulation. The fact
that animals will forego food and drink or will willingly
experience a painful stimulus to receive stimulation of the
reward system attests to the powerful reinforcing characteristics
of the reward system. Most drugs of abuse, either directly or
indirectly, are presumed to affect the brain reward system.<br>
</p>

<p> Inducing activity in the brain reward system gives drugs of
abuse positive reinforcing actions that support their continued
use and abuse. Drug reinforcement is defined as increasing the
behavior that led to the taking of the drug. Put more simply,
individuals who use drugs experience some effect, such as
pleasure, detachment, or relief from distress which initially
establishes and then maintains drug self-administration. The
consequence of taking the drug enhances the probability that it
will continue to be used for some real or perceived effect and,
hence, tends to lead to continued compulsive self-administration.
In fact, the ability of a drug to support self-administration in
experimental animals is a measure of the drug's strength as a
reinforcer.<br>
</p>

<p> While growing evidence suggests that the brain reward system
plays a role in the reinforcing properties of most drugs of
abuse, the precise mechanisms involved are complex, vary among
substances, and have yet to be completely described (41,42,43).
For example, while some drugs of abuse directly affect the
chemical release of dopamine (see box 3-3), the interactions of
other neurotransmitters such as gamma amino butyric acid (GABA),
opioid peptides, and serotonin may also be important.<br>
</p>

<p> Chronic Actions <br>
</p>

<p> Chronic, long-term exposure to drugs of abuse can cause
changes in the brain that may take weeks, months, and possibly
years, to reverse once drug use has stopped.<br>
</p>

<p> Most drugs of abuse have complex actions in the brain and
other parts of the body resulting in a variety of behavioral
effects. In general, tolerance develops to many of the effects of
drugs of abuse and a withdrawal syndrome occurs on cessation
after prolonged use. However, the details of these phenomena vary
from drug to drug, and the specific details of the biological
mechanisms that underlie these phenomena are not completely
understood. Recent advances in neuroscience research have begun
to unravel how neuroadaptive responses manifest themselves for
various drugs of abuse.<br>
</p>

<p> Tolerance to a drug develops when, following a prolonged
period of use, more of the drug is required to produce a given
effect (33,38). This response occurs with many types of drugs. It
is a common, but unnecessary, characteristic of drug abuse (see
box 3-4). For example, while tolerance develops to some of the
effects of cocaine and amphetamines, sensitization can also occur
to some of their other effects. Also, while it is unclear from
available data whether tolerance develops to cocaine's
reinforcing effects, the notion is supported by some experimental
evidence and anecdotal reports from cocaine users that the drug's
euphoric action diminishes with repeated use. In a recent study,
it has been shown that acute tolerance to dopamine response is
induced by binge patterns of cocaine administration in male rats
(51). Tolerance develops to most of the effects, including the
reinforcing properties, of opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol.<br>
</p>

<p> Sensitization, the opposite of tolerance, occurs when the
effects of a given dose of a drug increase after repeated, but
intermittent, administration. Sensitization to a drug's effects
can play a significant role in supporting drug- taking behavior.<br>
</p>

<p> Dependence is a type of neuroadaptation to drug exposure.
With prolonged use of a drug, cells in the brain adapt to its
presence such that the drug is required to maintain normal cell
function. On abrupt withdrawal of the drug, the cell behaves
abnormally and a withdrawal syndrome ensues. Generally, the
withdrawal syndrome is characterized by a series of signs and
symptoms that are opposite to those of the drug's acute effects.
For example, withdrawal of sedative drugs produce excitation and
irritability. Conversely, withdrawal of stimulants produces
profound depression.<br>
</p>

<p> The magnitude of the withdrawal syndrome varies from drug to
drug. Although the severity varies, withdrawal is associated with
the cessation of use of most drugs of abuse. Opiates, cocaine,
amphetamines, barbiturates, alcohol, and benzodiazepines produce
pronounced and sometimes severe withdrawal symptoms
(20,24,56,68,74) while those for nicotine and caffeine are less
intense (1,31). A mild withdrawal episode is associated with
discontinued cannabis use, while none is associated with lysergic
acid diethylamide (LSD) use (12,63). No matter the severity of
the physical withdrawal syndrome, its existence can create a
craving or desire for the drug and dependence can play a very
strong role in recurrent patterns of relapse and maintaining
drug-seeking behavior to forestall withdrawal.<br>
</p>

<p> At one time, withdrawal was believed to peak within several
hours after drug-taking was discontinued and then dissipate;
similarly, common knowledge held that tolerance to most drugs was
thought to dissipate gradually with time, as the brain readapted
to the drug's disappearance. Substantial evidence now indicates
that persistent, residual neuroadaptations are present, which can
last for months or possibly years, and may or may not be
associated with the pathways that mediate physical dependence
(33,44,45,77). An important component of this phenomena may be
the learning which takes place during drug-taking behavior.
Moreover, with repeated cycles of abstinence and reinitiation of
drug use, the time required to elicit drug dependence grows
shorter and shorter. Evidence also indicates that the
administration of naloxone, a drug that blocks the actions of
opiates, may elicit a withdrawal syndrome in individuals who have
abstained from use for extended periods of time. These data
indicate the existence of long-lasting, drug- induced
neuroadaptive changes that persist for as yet undefined periods
of time. Although information explaining this effect is lacking,
these changes may help account for the relapses that sometimes
occur in long-term abstinent, drug-dependent individuals. <br>
</p>

<p> Abuse Liability <br>
</p>

<p> The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act
(Public Law 91-513) and the Psychotropic Substances Act of 1978
(Public Law 95-633) gives exclusive authority to the Secretary of
the Department of Health and Human Services to determine the
abuse liability of substances and to make recommendations
concerning substance regulation and other drug policy decisions.
Although the Secretary receives advice from the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and
various other regulatory agencies, these laws explicitly state
that the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) must provide to
the Secretary information relevant to the abuse potential of
suspected drugs of abuse and all facts key to an assessment of
their abuse potential. On the basis of this information from
NIDA, and input from FDA and DEA, the Secretary makes a judgment
as to the dependence potential of new drugs. NIDA supports a
variety of activities in commercial and private laboratories
around the country to provide this information. <br>
</p>

<p> A drug's abuse liability is measured by the likelihood that
its use will result in drug addiction. Many factors ultimately
play a role in an individual's drug-taking behavior;
nevertheless, the abuse potential of a drug is related to its
intrinsic rewarding properties and/or the presumed neuroadaptive
motivational effects that result from its prolonged use. Drugs
can be tested and screened for their abuse liability in animals.
Four criteria can be evaluated to classify a drug as having
significant abuse potential:<br>
</p>

<p> o pharmacological equivalence to known drugs of abuse,<br>
</p>

<p> o demonstration of reinforcing effects,<br>
</p>

<p> o tolerance, and<br>
</p>

<p> o physical dependence.<br>
</p>

<p> The capacity to produce reinforcing effects is essential to
any drug with significant abuse potential, whereas tolerance and
physical dependence often occur but are not absolutely required
to make such a determination.<br>
</p>

<p> Testing new pharmaceuticals for their abuse potential is an
important step in new drug development. Many major pharmaceutical
firms today emphasize the development of new and safer drugs for
pain reduction and in the development of psychoactive compounds
for treatment of brain disorders. In particular, scientific
strides in understanding the brain, neurological disease,
psychiatric disturbances, and aging are fueling research into
treatment of brain disorders. As psychoactive compounds become
available, they must be screened for abuse potential. The abuse
liability assessment of new products is not simply at the
discretions of the manufacturer. Various federal regulatory laws
mandate such testing and federal regulatory agencies are charged
with seeing that testing is carried out. The College on Problems
of Drug Dependence (CPDD), and, specifically, its Drug Evaluation
Committee (DEC), provides the majority of abuse liability testing
information to NIDA.<br>
</p>

<p> Animal models are generally used to screen for the abuse
potential of new drugs in earlier stages of drug development or
to evaluate abuse potential in drugs that cannot be readily
studied in humans (2). Laboratory methods for abuse potential
evaluation in humans are also well developed and is an area of
active research (21). However, factors such as the heterogeneity
of drug-using populations, the use of multiple drugs, and the
other biological, social, and environmental factors involved in
human drug use make human studies complex.<br>
</p>

<p> In terms of the validity of animal models as a means of
studying human drug addiction, an excellent correlation exists
between predicting the abuse liability of specific classes of
drugs in animals and humans (34). However, it is recognized that
animal models are imperfect and, in fact, there are examples of
drugs that proved to have significant abuse potential in humans,
whereas the preclinical testing in animals revealed relatively
minimal abuse potential (9,33,38). The ultimate answer to the
issue of whether a drug has significant abuse potential is
long-term experience with the drug once it has become available,
either legally or illegally. Nevertheless, animal models serve as
the only practical means of initially screening drugs for abuse
liability and have proven to be the most effective means of
detecting whether there is likely to be a problem in humans.<br>
</p>

<p> Self-Administration <br>
</p>

<p> The predominant feature of all drugs with significant
addiction-producing properties is that they are self-
administered. In fact, self-administration of a drug to the point
when the behavior becomes detrimental to the individual is the
primary criterion for classifying a drug as having significant
abuse potential for addiction. In addition to
self-administration, another contributing factor to abuse
liability is the notion of craving (9,33,38). Although craving is
a difficult term to quantify, once a drug is voluntarily or
involuntarily withdrawn, the increased desire to take the drug
can play a role in the relapse to substance abuse. As previously
mentioned, the reinforcing properties of the drug may shift the
pattern of administration established during the initial, early
phase of drug?addiction. Specifically, the drug may have
initially been self-administered for its pleasurable effects but
may eventually be self-administered to relieve the discomfort
associated with withdrawal.<br>
</p>

<p> Animals can be readily trained to self-administer drugs in a
variety of settings (9). Animal models of self- administration
provide a powerful tool that can give a good indication of the
abuse liability of new or unknown drugs. These models also permit
examination of the behavioral, physiological, and biological
factors leading to sustained self-administration.<br>
</p>

<p> Drug Discrimination <br>
</p>

<p> Another tool in the assessment of abuse liability of drugs is
drug discrimination, which refers to the perception of the
effects of drugs (3,9). Specifically, animals or humans trained
to discriminate a drug from a placebo show a remarkable ability
to discriminate it from other drugs with different properties.
These procedures also permit a determination of whether the
subject considers the drug to be the pharmacological equivalent
of another drug. Pharmacological equivalence refers to the fact
that drugs of particular classes, such as opiates, stimulants,
and depressants cause a series of affects on the brain and other
organs which collectively constitute their pharmacological
profile. Drug discrimination provides a useful measure in animals
to assess the subjective effects of drugs in humans.<br>
</p>

<p> Dependence and Tolerance <br>
</p>

<p> Physical dependence and tolerance to drugs of abuse can
readily be induced in animals by chronic administration of these
drugs (37,38). Following abrupt cessation of these drugs, a
withdrawal syndrome will often develop and, if given the
opportunity, self-administration rates will be increased.
Furthermore, since the understanding of the biological changes
which take place during the development of physical dependence
and tolerance are poorly understood in humans, with the possible
exception of opiate dependency (45), animal models offer a unique
opportunity to carry out experiments designed to address these
issues.<br>
</p>

<p> GENETIC FACTORS <br>
</p>

<p> Why does one person abuse or become dependent on drugs while
another, exposed to a similar environment and experiences, does
not? To date, the majority of biomedical research has focused on
the role, if any, that genetics plays in individual
susceptibility to substance abuse and dependence. There is
growing interest, however, in researching other factors that
effect a person's biological status. For example, nutrition,
biological development, in utero experiences, early exposure to
environmental lead, head injuries, and other environmental
components, can modify individual neurophysiology. Thus, while
this section features genetics, there are many other factors that
can influence individual biological susceptibility to the effects
of a drug.<br>
</p>

<p> Progress in understanding the genetics of various conditions
and diseases has brought with it a realization that substance
abuse and addiction probably involve a genetic component. That
is, hereditary biological differences among individuals may make
some more or less susceptible to drug dependency than others.
However, a genetic component alone is undoubtedly insufficient to
precipitate substance abuse and addiction. Unlike disorders such
as Huntington's disease and cystic fibrosis that result from the
presence of alterations in a single gene, any genetic component
of substance abuse is likely to involve multiple genes that
control various aspects of the biological response to drugs,
individual temperament, and the propensity to engage in
risk-taking behaviors, or physiological predisposition to become
an abuser. In addition, the involvement of many behavioral and
environmental factors indicates that any genetic component acts
in consort with other nongenetic risk factors to contribute to
the development of substance abuse and addiction. Thus, the
presence or absence of a genetic factor neither ensures drug
addiction nor precludes it. Two questions arise when considering
a genetic component to substance abuse and addiction. Do
inherited factors exist? If so, what are they? To date, most of
the work done in this field is related to alcoholism; much less
is known about the genetics of other drugs of abuse.<br>
</p>

<p> Do Inherited Factors Exist? <br>
</p>

<p> Results from family, twin, and adoption studies as well as
extensive research on animal models indicate that there are
heritable influences on patterns of alcohol use. Animal studies
using selective breeding techniques have established that alcohol
preference, the reinforcing actions of alcohol, alcohol
tolerance, and alcohol physical dependence can be affected by
genetic factors. Although fewer studies have examined the genetic
component of vulnerability to the addictive properties of other
drugs of abuse, evidence from animal studies confirms the role of
a genetic influence on the use and abuse of drugs other than
alcohol. To study nonalcoholic drug abuse in humans has been
difficult because of substantially lower population prevalence
and marked changes in availability and, hence, exposure to these
substances. Investigation in this area is further hampered by the
complexity of subjects' drug use--most drug abusers have used
(and had problems from using) multiple substances. This has led
researchers either to concentrate on one class of drug or to
treat all illicit drug use as equivalent. The tendency to lump
all illicit drugs into one category makes results difficult to
interpret or compare.<br>
</p>

<p> Family Studies: Alcoholism <br>
</p>

<p> References to a familial tendency or hereditary
&quot;taint&quot; of alcoholism date back to classical times
(23). Family studies have repeatedly confirmed that the risk of
alcoholism is higher among first-degree relatives (i.e., parents,
siblings, children) of alcoholics as compared with the general
population (54). Moreover, while family studies can establish
that a disorder (or liability to a disorder) is transmitted, in
general they fail to distinguish between biological and
environmental transmission. This issue, however, can be evaluated
in large family studies by analyzing multiple classes of
relatives with differing degrees of genetic relatedness.<br>
</p>

<p> Results of numerous family studies indicate that alcoholism
segregates within families, with male first-degree relatives of
alcoholics having a higher incidence (ranging from 27 to 54
percent) than female first-degree relatives (6 to 17 percent) as
compared to first-degree relatives of nonalcoholics (20 percent
of males, 4 percent of females) (26,66,76). In fitting models of
inheritance to family data, researchers concluded that observed
patterns of inheritance were consistent with the hypothesis that
familial factors predisposing to alcoholism were the same in men
and women, but that nonfamilial environmental factors exerted
more influence in the development of alcoholism in women (14).
However, a review of drug abuse research on women presented
several comparative studies of men and women showing that
alcoholism among some women appeared more highly correlated with
a family history of alcohol problems. Compared to alcoholic men
in various studies, alcoholic women had a greater likelihood of
having an alcoholic father and/or parents, as well as alcoholic
siblings (47). Additionally, while perhaps not genetically
influenced, familial alcoholics (those with at least one relative
with alcoholism) appear to have earlier onset, more antisocial
symptoms, more social complications of alcohol use, and worse
treatment outcome than nonfamilial alcoholics (22,62,70).<br>
</p>

<p> Familial is not identical to genetic, and in the case of
alcoholism, the familial patterns of inheritance are not
consistent with those of a purely genetic condition (36,79). In
addition, researchers suggest that the transmissibility of
alcoholism has increased over time (65). Thus, any genetic
factors promoting the development of alcoholism are significantly
moderated by nongenetic influences. <br>
</p>

<p> Family Studies: Other Drugs <br>
</p>

<p> Although fewer family studies have been conducted on the
genetic transmission of liability to other drugs of abuse,
researchers suggest that, as in the case of alcohol, addiction to
other psychoactive substances appears to run in families.<br>
</p>

<p> One study found evidence of drug use running in families,
based on family history obtained from individuals admitted for
substance abuse treatment (53). However, this study combined use
of all illicit drugs into one category and relied on self-reports
by the subject on his or her drug use as well as that of family
members. A large family interview of opiate addicts found that
the relatives of opiate users had elevated rates of drug
addiction as compared with the controls (67). In addition, an
association was found between opiate use and the presence of
antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). Further analysis of these
data revealed that the incidence of both drug abuse and ASPD was
higher among the siblings of the opiate subjects than among their
parents (49,50). <br>
</p>

<p> A familial association between opiate addiction and
alcoholism has been noted in some studies (46). However, another
family history study found that while both opiate addiction and
alcoholism clustered within families, co- occurrence of the
disorders within families occurred only as frequently as expected
by chance, thus supporting the hypothesis of independent
transmission (29).<br>
</p>

<p> Little has been done to test hypotheses regarding familial
transmission of liability to addiction to specific substances
other than opiates or alcohol. One study examining treated drug
abusers and their relatives found that alcoholism was equally
common among relatives of individuals who preferentially abused
opiates, cocaine, or sedative-hypnotics (27 percent, 31 percent,
and 24 percent of male relatives, respectively), whereas
relatives of sedative-hypnotic users were subject to diagnoses of
other substance abuses (2 percent of male relatives, versus 11
percent of male relatives of opiate abusers and 16 percent of
male relatives of cocaine abusers) (55). <br>
</p>

<p> Twin and Adoption Studies <br>
</p>

<p> Twin and adoption studies provide information to distinguish
between biological and cultural transmission. Twin studies
observe siblings raised in the same environment, but compare how
often identical twins, who are genetically identical, and
fraternal twins, who have the genetic similarity of nontwin
siblings are concordant for a trait. A high concordance rate for
a trait among identical twins versus fraternal twins usually
indicates a genetic component for the trait. Adoption studies, by
contrast, compare the presence of a trait among biological versus
adoptive family members or other control groups. In this way
individuals sharing the same environment but having different
genetic heritages, or vice versa, can be compared.<br>
</p>

<p> Evidence from twin studies suggests genetic influences on
drinking patterns as well as alcohol-related problems. Results
from twin studies demonstrate genetic influences on measures of
alcohol consumption such as abstention, average alcohol intake,
and heavy alcohol use (28,39,61). Twin studies also indicate an
inherited risk for smoking (16).<br>
</p>

<p> When evaluating the development of alcoholism, twin studies
have generally supported the existence of genetic influences over
the disorder's development. One early study found a higher
concordance rate for alcohol abuse between identical twins (54
percent) than in fraternal twins (28 percent) (35), while two
other studies did not find such a relationship (25,61). A 1991
study examined male and female identical twin pairs, and male and
female fraternal twin pairs, with one member of the pair meeting
the criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence (64). Researchers
found that identical male twins differed from fraternal male
twins in the frequencies of both alcohol abuse and dependence as
well as other substance abuse and/or dependence. On the other
hand, female identical and fraternal twins were equally likely to
abuse alcohol and/or become dependent on other substances, but
identical female twins were more likely to become alcohol
dependent. Another study of 356 twin pairs also found higher
identical than fraternal rates of concordance for problems
related to alcohol and drug use as well as conduct disorder (52).
The same study also noted that among men, heritability played a
greater role in the early rather than late onset of alcohol
problems, whereas no such effect was seen among women. However, a
study of 1,030 female twin pairs found evidence for substantial
heritability of liability to alcoholism, ranging from 50 to 60
percent (40).<br>
</p>

<p> Thus, twin studies provide general agreement that genetic
factors influence certain aspects of drinking. Most twin studies
also show genetic influence over pathological drinking, including
the diagnosis of alcoholism, which appears (like many other
psychiatric disorders) to be moderately heritable. Whether
genetic factors operate comparably in men and women, and whether
severity of alcoholism influences twin concordance is less clear.
How psychiatric comorbidity may affect heritability of alcoholism
also remains to be clarified. <br>
</p>

<p> Adoption studies have supported the role of heritable factors
in risk for alcoholism (6,11,71). The results from a series of
studies conducted in Denmark during the 1970s are typical.
Researchers studied male adoptees, later comparing them with
nonadopted brothers; female adoptees, later comparing them with
nonadopted daughters of alcoholics, comparisons were also made
with matched control adoptees. Sons of alcoholic and nonalcoholic
parents who were put up for adoption were compared for the
development of alcoholism. Sons of alcoholic parents were found
to be four times as likely as sons of nonalcoholic parents to
have developed alcoholism; evidence also suggested that the
alcoholism in these cases was more severe. The groups differed
little on other variables, including prevalence of other
psychiatric illness or &quot;heavy drinking.&quot; Being raised
by an alcoholic biological parent did not further increase the
likelihood of developing alcoholism; that is, rates of alcoholism
did not differ between the adopted-away children and their
nonadopted brothers. In contrast, a study of daughters of
alcoholics revealed no elevated risk of alcoholism (23).<br>
</p>

<p> Another analysis examined factors promoting drug abuse as
well as alcoholism (10). In this study, all classes of illicit
drug use were categorized into a single category of drug abuse.
Most of the 40 adopted drug abusers examined had coexisting ASPD
and alcoholism; the presence of ASPD correlated highly with drug
abuse. Among those without ASPD, a biological background of
alcoholism (i.e., alcoholism in a biological parent) was
associated with drug abuse. Also, turmoil in the adoptive family
(divorce or psychiatric disturbance) was associated with
increased odds for drug abuse in the adoptee.<br>
</p>

<p> Finally, results from other adoption studies suggest two
forms of alcohol abuse (7,13). The two forms were originally
classified by C.R. Cloninger as &quot;milieu-limited&quot; or
type 1 alcohol abuse and &quot;male-limited&quot; or type 2
alcohol abuse (15). Type 1 alcohol abuse is characterized by
moderate alcohol problems and minimal criminal behavior in the
parents, and is generally mild, but occasionally severe,
depending on presence of a provocative environment. Type 2 is
associated with severe alcohol abuse and criminality in the
biological fathers. In the adoptees, it is associated with
recurrent problems and appears to be unaffected by postnatal
environment.<br>
</p>

<p> While the appropriateness of the biological and environmental
parameters used in the Cloninger study have been challenged, the
discriminating characteristics used to classify individuals as
type 1 or 2 alcohol abusers have not been--until recently. A new
study of familial and nonfamilial male alcoholics has
investigated the type 1 and 2 classifications by analyzing the
importance of age differences and cohort distributions (19). The
researchers showed that among the male alcoholics, there was not
a clear distinction between familial and nonfamilial based
alcohol abuse problems and type 1 or 2 characteristics, as
reported in previous studies. Additionally, another recent
publication discusses the absence of paternal sociopathy in the
etiology of severe alcoholism, and the possibility of a type 3
alcoholism (30). This type of research raises obvious questions
as to the validity of the discriminating characteristics
originally outlined by Cloninger and currently used in the
classification of individual alcohol abusers.<br>
</p>

<p> In summary, adoption studies of alcoholism clearly indicate
the role of biological, presumably genetic, factors in the
genesis of alcoholism. They do not exclude, however, a possible
role for nongenetic, environmental factors as well. Moreover,
researchers have suggested more than one kind of biological
background may be conducive to alcoholism. In particular, one
pattern of inheritance suggests a relationship between parental
antisocial behavior and alcoholism in the next generation. Thus,
adoption studies, like other designs, suggest that even at the
genetic level, alcoholism is not a homogeneous construct.<br>
</p>

<p> What Is Inherited? <br>
</p>

<p> While study results indicate a probable genetic component to
alcoholism and probably other drug abuse, they lack information
about what exactly is inherited. For example, do individuals with
a family history of drug abuse have an increased susceptibility
or sensitivity to the effects of drugs with reinforcing
properties? If a susceptibility exists, what are its underlying
biological mechanisms? To understand what might be inherited,
both individuals who have a substance abuse problem and animals
models of substance abuse are studied. Various types of
information can be derived from these studies. As with family,
twin, and adoption studies, much more information is available
about alcoholism as compared with other drugs of abuse.<br>
</p>

<p> First, it may be possible to identify specific inherited risk
markers for alcoholism and other substance abuse. A risk marker
is a biological trait or characteristic associated with a given
condition. Thus, if an individual is found to have an identified
marker for substance abuse, he or she is at risk for developing a
drug dependency. To date, no biological characteristic has been
clearly identified as being a risk marker for either alcoholism
or substance abuse, although evidence suggests some possible
candidates. The identification of a valid and reliable risk
marker could provide important information about the fundamental
mechanisms underlying substance abuse and addiction and would be
an invaluable aid in diagnosis and treatment.<br>
</p>

<p> Second, inherited differences in biochemical, physiological,
and anatomical processes related to differences in drug responses
might be identified and studied. Animal models of substance abuse
allow thorough biological assays to be carried out. Animal
genetic models of substance abuse consist of strains of animals
(usually rodents) that have been selectively bred to either
exhibit a preference for taking or refusing a drug, or to differ
in some way in their behavioral or physiological response to a
drug. In the case of alcohol, studies suggest that low doses of
alcohol are more stimulating and produce a stronger positive
reward in rats bred to have a high preference for alcohol as
compared with normal rats. Experimental data indicate that this
may be due to inherited differences in the dopamine, GABA, and
serotonin systems (27,32, 57,73). These differences represent
inherited traits related to drug taking behavior, and these
animals can be examined to determine what biological mechanisms
are involved in the expression of these traits.<br>
</p>

<p> Third, the genetic technique of linkage analysis can narrow
the area on a chromosome where a gene may be located. It can lead
to the identification of the gene itself which in turn can
improve the understanding of the molecular events that underlie
the expression of the gene. There have been few genetic linkage
studies related to substance abuse since few specific biological
traits associated with drug dependency have been identified. Some
studies in humans have been carried out related to alcoholism but
the findings of these studies are contradictory and inconclusive.<br>
</p>

<p> Several studies have reported an association between
alcoholism and a gene that regulates the number of a type of
dopamine receptor in the brain; other studies have found no such
link (4,5,8,18,58). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear.
One study revealed a relationship between the presence of the
gene not only in alcoholics, but in other disorders such as
autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Tourette's
syndrome (17). Thus, the presence of this particular gene, while
not uniquely specific for alcoholism, may cause an alteration in
the brain's dopamine system that somehow exacerbates or
contributes to alcohol abuse.<br>
</p>

<p> Few studies have examined possible inherited biological
mechanisms associated with the abuse of other drugs. For example,
strains of rats and mice that differ in their sensitivity to the
reinforcing effects of cocaine and in their cocaine-seeking
behavior have been observed to also have differences in the
actual number of dopamine-containing neurons and receptors in
certain brain areas. Also, a comparison of one strain of rat that
self-administers drugs of abuse at higher rates than another
strain, found that the higher self-administering strain exhibited
differences in the intracellular mechanisms that control activity
in some of the neurons in the brain reward system (see box 3-2)
as compared with the low self-administering strain. Additional
studies exploring the role of genes in drug response are needed
to more fully understand the full range of biological factors
associated with drug abuse. The recent development of new and
more sensitive techniques to analyze brain activity and processes
will facilitate these studies. <br>
</p>

<p> ROLE OF LEARNING <br>
</p>

<p> The learning that occurs during drug-taking activities is an
important force in the continued use and craving of drugs
(59,72). Drugs of abuse often produce feelings of intense
pleasure in the user. In addition, such drugs produce changes in
numerous organ systems (e.g., cardiovascular, digestive,
endocrine). Both the behavioral and physiological effects of a
drug occur in the context of the individual's drug-seeking and
drug-using environment. As a result, environmental cues are
present before and during an individual's drug use that are
consistently associated with a drug's behavioral and
physiological effects. With repetition the cues become
conditioned stimuli, that on presentation, even in the absence of
the drug, evoke automatic changes in organ systems and sensations
that the individual reports as drug craving. This is analogous to
Pavlov's classical conditioning experiments in which dogs
salivated at the cue of a bell following repeated pairing of food
presentation with a ringing bell. Evidence for this effect is
seen in numerous studies showing that animals seek out places
associated with reinforcing drugs and that the physiological
effects of drugs can be classically conditioned in both animals
and humans (72).<br>
</p>

<p> Conditioning also occurs in relation to the withdrawal
effects of drugs (75). It was observed that opiate addicts who
were drug free for months and thus should not have had any signs
of opiate withdrawal, developed withdrawal symptoms (e.g.,
yawning, sniffling, tearing of the eyes) when talking about drugs
in group therapy sessions. This phenomenon, termed conditioned
withdrawal, results from environmental stimuli acquiring the
ability, through classical conditioning, to elicit signs and
symptoms of pharmacological withdrawal. Conditioned withdrawal
can also play a role in relapse to drug use in abstinent
individuals. The emergence of withdrawal symptoms as a result of
exposure to conditioned cues can motivate an individual to seek
out and use drugs.<br>
</p>

<p> These associations are difficult to reverse. In theory,
repeated presentation of the environmental cues, without the drug
should extinguish the conditioned association. Animal studies
indicate that stopping the conditioned response is difficult to
achieve and does not erase the original learning. These types of
studies examining drug conditioning have found that various
aspects of extinguished responses can either be reinstated with a
single pairing of the drug and environmental cue, can be
reinstated with a single dose of drug in the absence of the
environmental cue, or canspontaneously recover (72).<br>
</p>

<p> Thus, exposure to environmental cues associated with drug use
in the past can act as a stimulus for voluntary drug- seeking
behavior. If the individual succeeds in finding and taking the
drug, the chain of behaviors is further reinforced by the
drug-induced, rewarding feelings and the effects of the drug on
other organ systems (59). The effects of the environmental
stimuli can be similar to the priming effects of a dose of the
drug.<br>
</p>

<p> The complexity of human responses to drugs of abuse, coupled
with the number of drugs that are abused, complicates
understanding of the role of biology in drug use and abuse.
Nevertheless, scientists know the site of action of many drugs in
the brain, and sophisticated new devices are expected to improve
that understanding. A genetic component to drug use and abuse is
likely, but it has not been fully characterized.<br>
</p>

<p> SUMMARY <br>
</p>

<p> Underlying all alcohol and drug problems are the actions and
effects that drugs of abuse exert. It is important to understand
how drugs work in the brain, why certain drugs have the potential
for being abused, and what, if any, biological differences exist
among individuals in their susceptibility to abuse drugs.<br>
</p>

<p> Two biological factors contribute to substance abuse and
addiction: the effects drugs of abuse exert on the individual,
and the biological status of the individual taking drugs. The
effects the drugs exert can be either acute or chronic and will
vary depending on the drug and its route of administration. Most
drugs of abuse influence the brain's reward system. The
pleasurable sensations that drug use can produce reinforce
drug-seeking and -taking behaviors. These actions differ with
different drugs: and, thus, some substances have greater
potential for abuse and addiction than others.<br>
</p>

<p> Prolonged or chronic use of a substance or substances can
produce both biological and behavioral changes (some long-
lasting). Biological changes can include sensitization and/or
tolerance and, if use is discontinued, withdrawal. The behavioral
changes from continued drug use are directly related to these
biological changes. An individual's drug- craving, -seeking, and
-taking behaviors are amplified through the neuroadaptive changes
in the brain reward system that occur with chronic
administration.<br>
</p>

<p> Environmental cues also play a large role in drug-seeking and
-taking behavior. On encountering certain environmental stimuli
(i.e., specific locations, smells, tastes), drug- craving and
drug withdrawal symptoms have been reported by former drug users
who have been drug-free for months, even years.<br>
</p>

<p> Through family, twin, and adoption studies, most researchers
agree that genetic factors play some part in the heritability of
alcohol problems and, although less clear, other drug problems.
No conclusive evidence has been found to explain precisely what
is inherited or the overall importance of this inherited
material. It has been hypothesized that there are probably
numerous genes (as opposed to one) that interact in complex ways,
and whose expressions are affected by a myriad of environmental
factors. Thus, the presence or absence of a genetic factor
neither ensures nor protects against drug dependency.<br>
</p>

<p> BOX 3-1: Neuropharmacology <br>
</p>

<p> Neurons are the cells that process information in the brain.
Neurotransmitters are chemicals released by neurons to
communicate with other neurons. When a neuron is activated it
releases a neurotransmitter into the gap between two neurons (see
figure 3-1). The molecules of the neurotransmitter move across
the gap and attach to proteins, called receptors, in the outer
wall of an adjacent cell. Once the receptor is activated, the
neurotransmitter is removed from the gap, either by reabsorption
into the neuron that released it or by being broken down
chemically.<br>
</p>

<p> For each neurotransmitter in the brain, there are specific
receptors to which it can attach. Receptors and receptor subtypes
can activate a variety of membrane and cellular mechanisms. In
this way, one chemical can have diverse effects in different
areas of the brain. Many chemicals have been identified as
neurotransmitters. Some particularly relevant to the reported
pleasurable sensations associated with drug abuse include
dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, opioids and other
neuropeptides, gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), and glutamate.<br>
</p>

<p> A neuron can have thousands of receptors for many different
neurotransmitters. Some neurotransmitters activate neurons
(excitatory neurotransmitters), while others decrease neuron
activity (inhibitory neurotransmitters). Some receptors are
biochemically coupled: the activation of one modulates the
function of the other, either increasing or decreasing its
activity. A neuron can also have receptors for the chemical it
releases. In this way, neurons can regulate their release of a
particular neurotransmitter. Thus, these so-called autoreceptors
act as a feedback mechanism. The activity of a neuron will be
determined by the cumulative activity of all its various
receptors. <br>
</p>

<p> Drugs that work in the brain, including drugs of abuse, alter
normal neuropharmacological activity through a variety of
different mechanisms. They can affect the production, release, or
reuptake of a chemical, they can mimic or block the action of a
chemical at a receptor, or they can interfere with or enhance the
activity of a membrane or cellular mechanism associated with a
receptor. Prolonged drug use has the potential to alter each of
these processes. <br>

</p>

<p> BOX 3-2: The Brain Reward System <br>
</p>

<p> Eating, drinking, sexual, and maternal behaviors are
activities essential for the survival of the individual and the
species. Natural selection, in order to ensure that these
behaviors occur, has imbued them with powerful rewarding
properties. The brain reward system evolved to process these
natural reinforcers.<br>
</p>

<p> The reward system is made up of various brain structures. A
key part of this system for drug reward appears to be the
mesocorticolimbic pathway (MCLP). The MCLP is composed of the
axons of neuronal cell bodies in the middle part of the brain
(i.e., ventral tegmental area) projecting to areas in the front
part of the brain (i.e., the nucleus accumbens, a nucleus in the
limbic system, a network of brain structures associated with
control of emotion, perception, motivation, gratification, and
memory; medial prefrontal cortex, part of the front of the brain
involved with higher ordered thinking) (see figure 3-2). Ventral
tegmental neurons release the neurotransmitter dopamine to
regulate the activity of the cells in the nucleus accumbens and
the medial prefrontal cortex. Other parts of the reward system
include the nucleus accumbens and its connections with other
limbic structures, and other regions in the front part of the
brain (i.e., substantia innominata-ventral palladium). The
nucleus accumbens also sends signals back to the ventral
tegmental area. Finally, other neuronal pathways containing
different neurotransmitters regulate the activity of the
mesocorticolimbic dopamine system and may also be involved in
mediating the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse.<br>

<p> BOX 3-3: How Drugs of Abuse Affect the Chemical Release of
Dopamine <br>
</p>

<p> The rewarding properties of stimulant drugs such as cocaine
and amphetamines are due directly to the effects of the chemical
dopamine. Opiates, on the other hand, indirectly stimulate
dopamine by activating other chemical pathways, which in turn
increase dopamine activity. Similarly, alcohol, barbiturates, and
benzodiazepines likely have an indirect action which increases
dopamine activity. All of these drugs have reinforcing
properties. Phencyclidine (PCP) is also a strong reinforcer but
its relationship, if any, to activity in the dopamine pathway has
yet to be established. Other drugs are either weak reinforcers or
have not been shown to support self-administration in animal
experiments. Nicotine stimulates dopamine neurons; however, its
effect is modest when compared with cocaine or amphetamine.
Likewise, caffeine is a weak reinforcer, but the precise
mechanisms of its reinforcement are unclear. Finally, cannabis
and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) also produce positive
effects that clearly support their use.<br>
</p>

<p> SOURCE: Office of Technology Assessment, 1994.<br>
</p>

<p> BOX 3-4: The Two Types of Tolerance <br>
</p>

<p> The two types of tolerance are: dispositional
(pharmacokinetic) and pharmacodynamic. Dispositional tolerance
develops when the amount of drug reaching active sites in the
brain is reduced in some way. Generally, this arises from an
increased breakdown of the drug or a change in its distribution
in the rest of the body. Thus, more drug must be taken to achieve
the same blood levels or concentrations at the active sites in
the brain.<br>
</p>

<p> Pharmacodynamic tolerance represents a reduced response of
the brain to the same level of drug. It develops during the
continued and sustained presence of the drug. It may be that the
mechanism of adaptation may differ from drug to drug and depend
on the original mechanism of action of a given drug. The net
effect is that more drug is required to overcome this new
neuronal adaptation to produce an equivalent pharmacologic
effect.<br>
</p>

<p> Although dispositional tolerance represents a component of
tolerance to some drugs (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates), in most
cases much or all of the tolerance which develops to drugs with
significant abuse potential can be attributed to pharmacodynamic
tolerance. Tolerance can contribute to drug- taking behavior by
requiring that an individual take larger and larger doses of a
drug to achieve a desired effect.<br>

</font></b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"> </p>

<p> This chapter reviews substance use and abuse-related research
on factors and interventions in homes, schools, workplaces,
recreational and other developmental settings, and community-wide
settings. These community activity settings are the major
physical and social arenas in communities where individuals
interact and learn their values, attitudes, and behaviors, some
of which can increase or reduce the likelihood that individuals
will use and abuse substances. The addition of treatment settings
of all types and correctional settings would provide a fairly
comprehensive and systematic overview of all the major settings
in communities. Those settings are not discussed at length in
this report, however, because of its focus primarily on
prevention, even though comprehensive prevention strategies will
almost always want to include treatment and correctional
components as well. </p>

<p> By focusing on any one of these settings, researchers
interested in substance use and abuse can study the interplay of
multiple factors in a context, and practitioners can implement
programs designed for specific settings. By examining all of
these settings together, policymakers and practitioners
interested in substance abuse and the healthy development of
individuals and communities can identify and, within available
resources, implement concrete, systematic, and comprehensive
preventive interventions for communities as a whole. The
development and strengthening of community-wide norms against the
use of substances may well be one of the more important ways to
protect individuals against the use of substances. The section on
communities discusses some of the issues and tools for
community-wide prevention planning and coordination. </p>

<p> HOMES AND FAMILIES </p>

<p> Although American society expects families in their homes to
take the lead in dealing with substance abuse and other problem
behaviors (69), families in this country generally receive only
limited outside support in protecting themselves against
substance abuse. This situation may result in part from the
belief that most nuclear families can raise their children
largely independently and therefore do not need outside support,
and in part from the belief that teens and young adults are more
influenced by their peers. The first belief, however, is not
supported by long- standing practices in most societies, where
extended families and life-long neighbors have traditionally
helped raise children (although in the United States many parents
do not have access to these additional child-rearing resources
because of urbanization, high technology, and family mobility).
And the second belief is being questioned by growing evidence
that certain parenting practices and family intervention programs
can significantly reduce the risk of substance abuse among
adolescents and young adults. </p>

<p> An extensive and growing body of research strongly suggests
that many families do need, and can benefit from, support from
outside the family, and can often protect their children from
substance abuse, even into adolescence and adulthood. While some
of the findings reported here may appear to be commonsensical,
they are presented because they have been addressed by
researchers as part of a growing body of increasingly rigorous
research. Some of the studies focus on risk and protective
factors that are known or thought to be associated with substance
use and abuse, while others focus directly on substance use and
abuse. To reduce redundancy, factors and programs discussed
elsewhere in this report are for the most part not considered
here. </p>

<p> Protective Factors </p>

<p> Families can protect against substance use and abuse by
providing close family relationships, sufficient monitoring,
clear messages about substance use and abuse, and attractive
alternatives to substance use and abuse. </p>

<p> Close Family Relationships </p>

<p> Family relationships can help protect against substance use
and abuse when they are characterized by closeness and warmth,
effective and positive discipline, and successful problem solving
and communications. For example, young people who report feeling
close to their families are less likely to abuse substances than
those who report not feeling close to their families. Parents in
such families are more likely to comfort their children when they
are afraid, have two-way communications, and give children some
say in what happens to them (83,86,152). Because such parents
spend more time with their children, there can be more conflict,
but the time spent together can also lead to greater mutual
understanding and acceptance (23,59). </p>

<p> Parents can better channel their children away from substance
use and abuse if they have routinely used effective,
age-appropriate discipline methods, including clear expectations
and rules about homework, television, curfews, and drugs and
alcohol. Such methods are particularly effective when they are
enforced by praise and encouragement, instead of by threatening,
nagging, and blaming (42,47). In contrast, ineffective or
provocative family management practices, including overly harsh
or reluctant discipline practices and inconsistent followthrough,
are associated with early sampling of substances and later abuse
(8,115). Unruly behaviors in childhood can lead children to poor
achievement in school, social rejection by more conventional
peers, and greater association with other children with behavior
problems (46). </p>

<p> Skillful handling of problems by families helps children
learn how to distance themselves from problems and address them
with specific problem-solving strategies (77). Such skills can
help children later avoid the use and abuse of substances. By
contrast, families where children eventually abuse substances do
not make decisions and solve problems as well as other families
(97). Positive caregiving and discipline can prevent negative
outcomes even for highly stressed, minority, low socioeconomic
status (SES), urban families (177). When the birth parents are
not available, effective parenting by a surrogate, relative, or
neighbor can also be protective (173). </p>

<p> Sufficient Monitoring </p>

<p> When parents or parent surrogates know how their children are
spending their time, the risk of substance abuse is low (47).
Such monitoring may prevent abuse by reducing access to
substances, preventing use of substances, or allowing parents to
identify substance use earlier and to apply sanctions. Monitoring
may also entail greater involvement by parents in their
children's lives, which may help render substance use and abuse
less appealing by enhancing feelings of trust, warmth, and
closeness in the family. Such monitoring prevents substance
sampling across ages, ethnicities, and settings. </p>

<p> Single parents and working parents are often less able to
monitor their children thoroughly, because they can be in only
one place at a time. However, grandmothers, aunts, after-school
personnel, and other caring and supportive adults can also
monitor children and help reduce deviant behaviors (59,88). Early
autonomy and unsupervised leisure time apparently increase the
risk of substance use and abuse by children. </p>

<p> Clear Messages About Effects of Substances, Including
Sanctions </p>

<p> Children are more likely to avoid the use of substances if
they know that use will bring negative outcomes, such as adverse
physical and psychological effects, disapproval, and penalties
imposed by parents. Many children develop expectations about the
effects of substances as early as the preschool years (100),
influenced primarily by their parents. Frequent parental use even
of aspirin, cold pills, prescribed psychotropic medications (85),
and cough medicine can give children positive expectations about
the effects of substances (61). </p>

<p> When parents apply reliable penalties, such as revoking
privileges, and coach their children about the adverse effects of
substances, use is likely to discontinue (6). By contrast, if the
possible adverse effects (e.g., illness and depression) are not
emphasized and few negative sanctions are applied when
adolescents first use marijuana, while the immediate experiences
are to feel pleasantly stoned and potent (87), then continued use
and adult drug problems are more likely (37). Parental
disapproval of children's alcohol use has been found to be
protective across ethnic groups (33). Increased appreciation of
risks and social disapproval of substance use is credited with
the recent downturn in cocaine and marijuana use nationally (5). </p>

<p> Attractive Alternatives to Substance Use and Abuse </p>

<p> Participation in religious and other conventional and
challenging activities can protect against substance use and
abuse (26,81,111,173). Especially important are activities about
which youth are passionate. </p>

<p> Parents are more likely to guide their children away from
substance use and abuse if parents have instilled hope in their
children to succeed as adults (172). By contrast, some children
do not look forward to and plan for adulthood, but learn only
short-term thinking (see box 8-1) and have been encouraged by
their parents to believe they cannot succeed. </p>

<p> Parents of inner-city African American children face special
difficulties in holding out hope for their children's success
through traditional opportunities. Unemployment among African
American men is almost 50 percent (24) and the marriage rate
among African American women is low and still declining (10),
with substance use and abuse among African Americans increasing
as they reach 26 to 34 years of age, instead of decreasing as
with other racial and ethnic groups (164). </p>

<p> Risk Factors </p>

<p> Families also face risk factors, such as parental neglect and
rejection, behavioral problems and crime, physical and sexual
abuse, substance abuse in the family, failure in school,
emotional problems, negative life events, early use of
substances, substance abuse in the neighborhood, and poverty,
unemployment, and homelessness. Because some of these factors are
discussed elsewhere in this report, this section will focus only
on parental neglect and rejection, physical and sexual abuse,
substance abuse in the family, negative life events, and drug
trafficking in the neighborhood. </p>

<p> Parental Neglect and Rejection </p>

<p> Children who are neglected anytime, but especially from
earliest childhood, are at greater risk of substance abuse
(17,142). When children have been continually rejected, they
become immune to parental guidance. Such children fail to form
close relationships, get along with others, solve problems, and
regulate impulses. </p>

<p> Physical and Sexual Abuse </p>

<p> Physical or sexual abuse in childhood leads to greater
vulnerability to substance abuse in adolescence and adulthood
(38). Rape victims, particularly those with Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, are 20 times more likely to have
subsequent substance abuse problems (165). Substance abuse
rehabilitation programs report that as many as 60 to 70 percent
of the female patients and 25 percent of the male patients have
been sexually victimized, while 43 percent have been beaten
(45,99,92). Victims of sexual or physical abuse often report
wishing to avoid unpleasant memories, including flashbacks to the
abuse (126). The use of substances may help some victims forget
for awhile (see box 8-2). </p>

<p> Substance Abuse in the Family </p>

<p> The biological children of alcoholics have a higher than
average chance of abusing alcohol, even if they are reared away
from their alcoholic parents (40,63). Thus, a part of the
vulnerability to alcohol abuse, at least for some, may be
inherited. Children of alcoholics, for example, may experience
more positive effects or fewer negative effects from the use of
alcohol. Either of these responses could result from individual
differences in experienced pharmacological effects of drugs (135)
or differences in temperament that can be modified by the use of
alcohol and other drugs (154). </p>

<p> In addition to friends and acquaintances, relatives are a
common source of alcohol and other drugs for teens. Family
members and other relatives can be very persuasive when they
offer such substances to teens. One study, that included both
abstainers and heavy users, found that young people refused
available substances, mainly alcohol, 46 percent of the time when
friends offered them, but only 18 percent of the time when
relatives outside the family offered them. When their own parents
offered such substances, the young people never refused (9).
Family members who use substances can also inadvertently make
them available to teens by leaving family cabinets containing
alcohol or pills unlocked (35). </p>

<p> Family members can learn how to use alcohol and other drugs
by watching and listening to abusing family members; they can
also adopt the abusing members' expectations about the effects of
these substances. For example, children of alcoholics are more
likely to think that the purpose of drinking is to get drunk
(107). They also have greater expectations for the use of alcohol
(143), and sometimes believe they can do things better after a
few drinks. </p>

<p> Families with a substance abusing parent experience
significant disruptions in many aspects of their lives, including
child rearing (160). Substance abusing parents and spouses often
have difficulties guiding their children, especially away from
substances, because of inconsistent nurturing, monitoring, and
disciplinary practices (36,47). Their abuse of substances can
also rob children of stability in life and of competent adult
role models. Even a nondrinking spouse can become so involved
with the drinking spouse and so depressed and isolated from
social support that children feel neglected (13). Marital quality
can be affected (160), and the level of conflict and verbal and
physical aggression can be high (151). In addition, adolescent
and adult children of substance abusers are less influenced by
their parents and have lower parental attachment, less
involvement with other people, more difficulty getting along with
other people (84), lower self- esteem, lower academic
achievement, higher depression (128), and a greater number of
other psychiatric symptoms (143). </p>

<p> Major Negative Life Events </p>

<p> Substance use and abuse often increase as children experience
more negative events (106,174) (see table 8-1). Adult alcoholics
report a significantly higher number of severe life events just
before their alcohol dependency begins (65), with seven out of
eight of them reporting disruptions in important personal
relationships, such as with friends, lovers, or spouses. Among
the elderly, late- onset alcoholism is reportedly preceded by new
feelings of loneliness and depression, perhaps also due to recent
losses of important relationships (120,134). </p>

<p> Such negative life events may heighten vulnerability to
substance abuse by increasing depression (174). For instance, one
study found that children who had lost a parent to death had a
7.5 times greater risk of developing a depression than other
children (60). Negative life events may also occasion perceptions
of helplessness and decreased personal control; these too can be
offset, at least for awhile, by some drugs (91). </p>

<p> Families are likely to have the greatest difficulty
preventing substance abuse if friends abuse substances (86,109)
or if substance use is rampant in the neighborhood
(39,44,51,124). Such conditions encourage substance use and
reduce the barriers against use by making drugs continuously
available and socially acceptable (even appealing) and by
providing temporary escape from the frequent hassles and
tragedies of life among highly transient and troubled (rather
than stable and helpful) neighbors (146). </p>

<p> Programs To Enhance Protective Factors </p>

<p> This section discusses some of the numerous programs that
have been developed for families with infants, school-aged
children, and young adults. Few of these programs specifically
target substance abuse and addiction, but many have been found to
enhance family-based protective factors and/or reduce risk
factors that can be associated with drug abuse. Unlike some
school-based programs, methodologically rigorous studies
correlating the efficacy of these programs to the level of
substance abuse and addiction have yet to be done. </p>

<p> Families With Infants </p>

<p> Parent education, prenatal and infant care, and social
support programs help strengthen involved and responsive
parenting (4), which in turn can significantly reduce substance
abuse risk factors such as child abuse and neglect and childhood
accidents. </p>

<p> Parents who had participated in such programs attained more
education, had fewer other children, and were less likely to be
on welfare by the time their children were 10 years old, than
parents who had not participated in such programs. Participating
parents reported less stress and more confidence in their
parenting (175). Most importantly, children were dramatically
less likely to experience attendance, behavior, or academic
problems in school (112,138,139). </p>

<p> These programs can take many forms: </p>

<p> o a neighborhood house where parents and their infants can
come during the day for companionship, child care advice, social
services, and health care from a stable professional staff (139);
</p>

<p> o twice-a-week home visits by the same nurse, from pregnancy
until the child is 2 years old (112); </p>

<p> o home visits, with child development advice, help in
acquiring other services, and time-limited family counseling to
lower conflict and increase support from the extended family; </p>

<p> o a public school dedicated to pregnant teens and new mothers
and that provides health and child care education, social
services, and intensive high school education (138); and </p>

<p> o parent meetings in the hospital where the baby was born
(175). </p>

<p> Families With School-Age Children </p>

<p> Parent training and support programs can help parents of
school-aged children motivate their children to more willingly
pay attention to and accept parental guidance and to develop
skills for success outside the family. A parent training program
called WINNING, provided through a Texas school system, increased
positive and corrective feedback from parents to children,
increased parent-child interactions, and decreased the attention
parents gave to inappropriate child behavior. Concomitantly, the
portion of their children's behavior that was inappropriate
decreased (43). </p>

<p> Another parent training and support program, &quot;How to
Help Your Child Succeed in School,&quot; was offered through
Seattle, Washington schools to increase protective factors and
reduce risk factors for substance use and abuse. After the
program, parents spent more time reading with their children and
provided more consistent positive and negative consequences for
behavior (70,71, 72,73,74). </p>

<p> Involving parents more in schools can further
supportparenting and prevent it from being undermined by peers
and by school environments. In the School Development Program in
New Haven, Connecticut, for example, parents serve as members of
the School Advisory Council and as employees or volunteers in
classrooms. Significant improvements have been seen in student
attendance, language skills, math scores, and social competence,
and virtually all classroom behavior problems have been
eliminated (34,41). </p>

<p> A community grassroots effort to provide these and other
resources for parents began 17 years ago in the Ravendale section
of Detroit, Michigan. The &quot;Joy of Jesus&quot; programs now
support families living in more than 30 contiguous blocks. Every
day after school about 250 youth of all ages participate in
scheduled activities such as tutoring, music, dance, gym,
writing, teen sex education, cultural field trips, university
tours, and an entrepreneur's club (for 30 teens who are starting
their own businesses). This program provides several substance
abuse protective factors and prevents the risk factor of school
failure, by monitoring report cards and enrolling students in an
individualized after-school motivational learning program, if
necessary. </p>

<p> In Los Angeles, California, an after-school tutoring and
activities program has been developed in a for profit apartment
building. The program, called EEXCEL, provides a room in the
building and live-in counselors and tutors who offer children a
&quot;sanctuary for education [and]...incentives for
learning.&quot; When report cards come out, good grades are
recognized at parties. Only those families that want this
resource for their children are accepted as tenants in the
building (108). </p>

<p> Atlanta, Georgia-based Inner-City Families in Action has been
presenting comprehensive information in a series of 2- hour
sessions about how specific drugs, such as alcohol or crack,
affect every system in the body, to residents in two Atlanta
housing projects. The curriculum is called &quot;You Have the
Right to Know.&quot; After 2 years of using the curriculum in
many locations, the narcotics arrests in both housing projects
are down (52). </p>

<p> Through flyers, personal invitations from schools, and a 1-
hour television special, parents were recruited to 87 local sites
around Seattle, Washington, for workshops on &quot;Preparing for
the Drug (Free) Years,&quot; led by trained parents. Surveys
showed that parents' attitudes and behaviors were changed in the
direction of providing protective factors. Parents also rated
highly the workshops' content, process, and leaders (71). </p>

<p> The Midwestern Prevention Project (Project STAR) in Kansas
City, Missouri, used the local media to recruit parents to become
involved in a school and parent substance abuse education course
and to repeat the messages for more than one year. This intensive
effort reduced the rate of increase in initiation of alcohol,
tobacco, and marijuana use among seventh and eighth graders who
had participated in the program, as compared to those who had not
participated (116). </p>

<p> Families With Young Adults </p>

<p> Job Corps, Peace Corps/VISTA programs, American Conservation
and Youth Service Corps, National and Community Service Programs,
universities, and the military all provide young people sheltered
work experiences, educational training if necessary, and
opportunities to live away from home with other young people in
structured environments. Research shows that such experiences
enhance the confidence of participants in their ability to work
hard (48). </p>

<p> Programs To Reduce Risk Factors </p>

<p> Reducing Drug-Trafficking and Substance-Using Peers </p>

<p> Operation Clean Sweep, now being run by the Chicago,
Illinois, Housing Authority, is designed to reduce drug dealing
and other crimes in housing projects. Staff approach one
high-rise building at a time, spending at least a whole day at
the building. State and local law enforcement officers and
housing authority security officers search apartment units (if
there is reasonable cause) for illegal weapons and unauthorized
residents. Authorized residents are given photo I.D. cards, while
others are put on the lease, given a 2-week pass, or asked to
leave. The maintenance staff makes repairs, cleans graffiti,
encloses lobbies, and builds a security station for 24-hour-a-day
surveillance and review of photo I.D.'s and passes for
admittance. The program is being replicated in cities across the
nation, with funding and technical assistance from the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). </p>

<p> Reducing Physical and Sexual Abuse </p>

<p> Physical and psychological security is important for the
emotional well-being of children (30) and may well reduce their
risk of later substance abuse. Mandatory arrest and brief
incarceration for physical and sexual abuse of children or
mothers has been shown to deter more repeat offenses than do
warnings or counseling alone (144), and court-mandated treatment
for convicted offenders seems to reduce later abuse even further
(50). Since 40 to 87 percent of adult sexual or physical abusers
also report alcohol or drug abuse, individuals treated for family
violence should perhaps also be screened and, if appropriate,
treated for substance abuse (176). </p>

<p> Reducing Substance Abuse in the Family </p>

<p> Substance abuse treatment for the family can reduce substance
abuse in the short-term and maintain those reductions in the
long-term (27,75, 101,147,149,153,). Substance abuse treatment
for married adults is more effective when both spouses are
involved (96), and especially with a behavioral approach to
marital problems (110). Clearly, families can help rehabilitate
substance abusers, thereby reducing the risk of substance abuse
for other family members. </p>

<p> Reducing Impact of Negative Life Events </p>

<p> Linking people with modest community supports during crises
or adjustments can reduce risk factors and enhance protective
factors. For example, when widows were contacted individually by
trained, previously widowed persons to discuss grief and
decisions to be made, 61 percent accepted the widow-aide services
(145) and one month after bereavement were less depressed and
less preoccupied with the past than widows who had received no
intervention. One year later, the intervention group was
significantly more resocialized in their roles as singles; two
years later, the health of the intervention group members was
significantly better than that of control group members (168). </p>

<p> Also, a 6-month program for newly separated or divorced
people in Colorado (which included both one-to-one counseling by
trained volunteers and group meetings about practical problems,
such as career planning and child- rearing) significantly reduced
the participants' problems and their anxiety, nervousness, and
fatigue. It also improved their psychological adjustment (less
guilt and self-blame, more competence), as compared with a
randomly selected control group (18). More indirect approaches
have also been tried. For example, socially isolated and lonely
individuals, who were provided a free blood pressure station in
the lobby of their innercity single room occupancy hotel, were
introduced to each other by the nurse and later formed a
&quot;Senior Activities Club.&quot; In another example, a surplus
food distribution service, that required individuals to work
together to get their food, produced new friendships (117). </p>

<p> Reducing Parental Neglect </p>

<p> Parents whose children failed to maintain gains after parent
education or family therapy are often socially isolated and
subject to seemingly insurmountable daily problems (49). An
experimental program--with weekly follow-up sessions with
isolated parents, to discuss environmental problems that affected
how parents saw their children's behavior--reduced maternal
criticisms of children, negative responses by children to
mothers, and child problem behaviors (170). When the weekly
discussions stopped, however, the negative interactions resumed. </p>

<p> In a more comprehensive program for low SES parents believed
by Child Protective Services to be at high risk for child abuse
or neglect, Project 12-Ways held meetings with parents in their
homes (95). Treatment goals were developed and, as needed,
behavioral training was provided in stress reduction,
assertiveness, self-control, leisure time planning, marital
counseling, and job finding. Social support groups, alcohol
treatment referral, homemakers, physicians, and mental health
workers were also involved. Parent compliance and involvement in
this 5- to 6-month program were high. Twenty months after
treatment, only 2 percent of Project 12-Ways parents abused or
neglected their children, while 10 percent of a nonprogram
comparison group did. </p>

<p> Families on the verge of having children placed in foster-
care, group homes, or psychiatric hospitals can benefit from
family preservation programs. Children have fewer behavioral and
academic problems when they are raised by birth-parents in safe
homes (130). Thus, the goal of a family preservation counselor is
to help the family out of the crisis and learn how to retain the
child safely at home. The interventions are typically intensive
and brief--for example, a counselor is available for meetings in
the home 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for about 6 weeks. The
counselor deals with any relevant problems, helping the family
clarify values, set goals, and solve problems, and helps connect
family members with community resources (see box 8-3). </p>

<p> Many families, especially those with substance abuse
problems, need more prolonged help. A family support program that
provides such longer term support is Camden House, in the
Ravendale section of Detroit, Michigan. A rundown house was
purchased, renovated, and made the center of an outreach and
drop-in program for about 10 local families with multiple
problems that included substance abuse, lack of skills, chronic
unemployment, early pregnancy, and crime. After staff had worked
with the families for one to two years, taking one problem at a
time and actively mentoring the parents, six out of 10 of the
original parents were out of the Camden House program, drug-free,
trained and employed, and safely and responsibly raising their
children. </p>

<p> SCHOOLS AND PEERS </p>

<p> Millions of school-age youth in the United States experiment
with alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs annually, often
(especially with alcohol) in ways that can cause overdose deaths,
accidental injuries or deaths, and permanent impairments. Many
school-age youth continue to use substances and later develop
long-term addictions. To address these substance abuse problems,
schools provide the most important settings for reaching young
people with standardized, broadly applied educational and
preventive messages. </p>

<p> Because school-age youth are especially likely to initiate
the use of alcohol and other drugs, much of the research has
focused on use, rather than on abuse and dependency. Such
research is nevertheless relevant to an understanding of abuse
and dependency, since use is a precondition and contributor to
abuse and dependency and even experimental use can be harmful.
For example, nearly half of all youth who experiment with
cigarettes develop long-term smoking habits, and alcohol and
marijuana use by youth with no chronic problems still contributes
to highway deaths, crime, and violence. This section summarizes
results from an analysis of survey research on the causes of
school-age substance use and discusses school-based prevention
programming. </p>

<p> Analysis of Survey Research on Causes of School-Age Substance
Use </p>

<p> OTA commissioned a review of the survey research literature
on school-aged substance use that compiled, classified, and
examined 9,930 statistical analyses from 242 separate studies.
This is by far the most extensive systematic examination of this
body of research conducted so far. Most of the studies dealt with
school-based populations, but some focused on school-age army
recruits, dropouts, children of alcoholics, and individuals
involved in clinics. The studies reported statistical
relationships between substance use and its postulated causes.
Statistical findings from the study reports were sorted into 11
major categories and 50 subcategories (see table 8-2), and then
analyzed to identify strong, moderate, and weak statistical
relationships, as well as those that had been insufficiently
studied. </p>

<p> Characteristics of Database </p>

<p> The studies tended to focus on so-called gateway substances,
with tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana analyses accounting for 82
percent of the completed analyses (see figure 8-1). Cocaine,
inhalants, heroin, and prescription drugs, which have recently
received extensive social attention, have been relatively ignored
by quantitative researchers to date; none of these latter
categories of substance use accounted for more than 5 percent of
the analyses in the research reports examined. Gateway drugs are
indeed important, since they may lead some individuals to later
abuse. Nevertheless, the literature has gaps. Inhalants, for
instance, may well be one of the most commonly used and abused
substances among some youth, but they have received almost no
attention from survey researchers. </p>

<p> Although the primary measures were of use, not abuse, the
database included some measures of alcohol abuse (e.g., drunk
driving and impairment from alcohol use). Abuse of cocaine,
heroin, and analgesics was not measured. The percentages of
analyses in the database for each of the 11 major types of
independent variables is displayed (see figure 8-2). The types of
independent variables most studied were personality, use by
others, and cognitive factors (including attitudes, beliefs, and
values). </p>

<p> Results of Analysis </p>

<p> After being sorted into the 11 major categories and 50
subcategories, the average of all the correlations in each
subcategory was calculated. Then, each subcategory was ranked by
its average correlation and the rankings were divided into three
groups, defined by ranges of correlations: primary (with
correlations over .30), secondary (with correlations between
about .20 and .30), and tertiary (with correlations under about
.20) (see figure 8- 3). </p>

<p> Primary correlates </p>

<p> The four variables that dominate as correlates of and
possible contributors to substance use are: 1) prior and
concurrent use of substances, 2) substance use by peers and
friends, 3) perceived peer attitudes about substance use, and 4)
offers to use substances. The prominence of prior and concurrent
use is consistent with the reinforcing nature of substance use
itself. The prominence of the other three variables emphasizes
the importance of the social environment in contributing to and
reinforcing substance use among school-age youth. </p>

<p> Secondary correlates </p>

<p> Of the 15 variables judged to be of secondary importance,
seven are social variables: 1) susceptibility to peer pressure,
2) resistance skills, 3)??perception of social pressure to use
substances, 4)? beliefs that such pressure can be effectively
handled, 5) beliefs about social consequences of use, 6)
bondedness (especially to school), and 7) peer group
characteristics. With the exception of parent attitudes about
substance use, other parental variables--such as parental
supervision, monitoring, and relations--are notably missing as
primary or secondary correlates. </p>

<p> Tertiary correlates </p>

<p> Of the 38 variables found to have no more than a minor role
in substance use, 10 were included in at least 100 of the
correlational analyses in the database for this review. They are:
1) substance use by parents, 2) personality traits, 3)
intelligence, 4) social personality traits, 5) parental
relations, 6) affect, 7) participation in structured activities,
8) bonding with the peer group, 9) beliefs about health
consequences of using substances, and 10) self-esteem. </p>

<p> Variables requiring further study </p>

<p> Several of the secondary and tertiary variables in the
studies reviewed here were insufficiently examined to allow
general conclusions to be drawn. However, they may later prove to
be useful to the field. For example, religious affiliation and
the development of substance use-specific values, while not
extensively studied as separate variables, both address issues
related to social norms and influences that have often been found
to be associated with substance use; thus, an association between
these two variables and the onset of substance use might be
expected. Also, availability may prove to be important,
especially if it is defined in future studies more broadly (e.g.,
as physical and social availability, as discussed in ch. 5)
rather than as potential availability (that is, how easy it
appears to be to get a substance, if motivated), as many current
surveys define it. </p>

<p> Preventive Interventions </p>

<p> Schools can seek to prevent substance use and abuse through
curriculum-based drug prevention programs and through other, more
novel approaches, such as school-based clinics, student
assistance programs, and holistic environmental interventions.
School-based prevention efforts have been hampered, however, by a
lack of good evaluation data on the most widely marketed programs
and by insufficient information about and dissemination of the
more promising programs. </p>

<p> Numerous studies of the effectiveness of curriculum-based
drug prevention programs have been completed and reviewed (67).
Studies of prevention programs focusing on tobacco have been
extensively reviewed (16,20,54,58,94,132,155) and alcohol studies
have been reviewed several times (62,64,102). Reviews of
school-based prevention curricula that specifically target
marijuana or cocaine do not exist. However, several reviews have
examined studies of programs designed to prevent the use of
multiple substances (7,25,102,131,156). Even these reviews,
however, typically focus primarily on tobacco and alcohol. </p>

<p> Effectiveness of Drug Abuse Resistance Education Program </p>

<p> Three merchandised curriculum programs have captured a
sizable share of the prevention program market: DARE (Drug Abuse
Resistance Education); Quest: Skills for Living; and Here's
Looking at You 2000. Of these, evaluations only of DARE have been
reported in sufficient numbers to allow conclusions to be drawn. </p>

<p> The DARE program is delivered in schools by uniformed police
officers who have been trained in any of five regional training
centers. It was designed by the Los Angeles, California, Unified
School District, which borrowed from research-based programs
developed in the early 1980s. DARE is delivered annually to about
5 million students in all 50 States, at a total cost of about $50
million (an average annual cost of about $10 per student) (93).
DARE is thus one of the better funded drug prevention programs in
schools. </p>

<p> One research team examined 17 published and unpublished
evaluations of DARE (53). For the 11 studies that met minimal
standards of methodological rigor, the average reductions in
substance use were very small. Use among control schools and DARE
schools was roughly equal. The few studies that were longitudinal
found neither short-term nor long-term reductions. </p>

<p> DARE has important strengths, including favorable reactions
among students who have participated in DARE programs, widespread
political support, substantial funding, uniformly reported
improvements in school-police relations, highquality of program
implementation, and expert marketing. However, these strengths
have not guaranteed that DARE is always effective as a drug
prevention program. A scientific advisory group has been
established to review research and evaluation of the DARE program
and to consider changes in the curriculum. </p>

<p> The General Accounting Office (GAO) estimated that about
one-fourth of the funds given to the States and local schools
under the Drug-Free School and Communities Act went toward
purchasing and delivering school curricula (163). However, widely
adopted curriculum packages (such as Quest: Skills for Living;
Here's Looking at You 2000; Project Adventure; BABES; Project
CHARLIE; and Children Are People) have presented no adequate
evaluation results that allow program effectiveness to be judged.
Evaluations conducted to date have been primarily short-term
reviews for dissertations and theses, and they lack interpretable
behavioral end-points. Given the widespread dissemination of
these curricula, quality evaluation studies would be important. </p>

<p> Conclusions About Curriculum-Based Prevention in Schools </p>

<p> Curriculum-based drug prevention efforts to date can be
characterized as showing promise (67,156), but critics point out
that the effectiveness of these programs, especially those that
are being commercially marketed, has not yet been proven and that
significant difficulties remain (102). Some of these are
methodological difficulties intrinsic to all field trial
research, while others relate to the possibly intrinsic
limitations of curriculum approaches when used alone. Individual
studies suggest that curriculum-based prevention programs in the
schools may ultimately be proven to be effective for preventing
substance use among some youth, especially when used as
components in more comprehensive substance use prevention
efforts. However, school-based prevention technologies currently
in use have not been refined and tested enough to demonstrate
their effectiveness for reducing substance use for students in
general, and especially not for multiproblem youth, who are at
higher risk of substance abuse. Clearly, for DARE and for the
other major school-based curriculum prevention programs,
resources must be set aside to properly evaluate program results.
</p>

<p> Noncurricular Approaches to School-Based Prevention </p>

<p> Curriculum-based efforts have dominated the field, largely
because they are relatively simple to understand, implement, and
replicate, and because methods to evaluate them have become
standardized. However, curriculum-based prevention programs have
not been demonstrated to be effective, and several noncurricular
approaches have recently emerged, including student assistance
programs, school-based clinics, and more holistic
school-community collaborations and alterations of psychosocial
environments in schools. These approaches have been evaluated
only rarely, but interest in them has been growing. For example,
although student assistance programs remain largely unevaluated,
they accounted for about half of the spending, under the Drug-
Free Schools and Communities Act, in six recently evaluated urban
school districts (163). </p>

<p> Student assistance programs try to identify substance-using
students early on and then provide social support, build skills
for dealing with life problems, or refer to treatment, as
appropriate. Peers often help as crisis managers, small group
facilitators, and referral agents, while adults often act as
program facilitators and counselors. Programs typically counsel
students who are children of alcoholics, who use alcohol or drugs
abusively, and who are performing poorly at school. Programs can
also help parents address their children's needs. </p>

<p> Only three evaluations of student assistance programs were
found by OTA for this review. Two focused on process issues only
(89,118), while one addressed program outcomes (90). The outcome
study focused on interventions for students in six residential
facilities, including a locked correctional facility. Although
the sites are atypical for student assistance programs, the
program otherwise resembled student assistance programs in
schools. </p>

<p> The outcome study found that marijuana and tobacco use
declined among program participants in five of the six
facilities. Alcohol use declined in half of the sites, while
alcohol use in two sites remained unchanged and in one site rose
slightly. The declines in use were observed at about nine and 15
months after participation in the program. Although these results
are promising, one study (especially a study conducted in
nonschool settings) cannot support general conclusions about the
effectiveness of student assistance programs in schools. </p>

<p> Many schools, either directly or through community agencies,
are bringing services into schools to help deal with social and
health problems that are often interrelated, such as depression,
violence, substance use, and sexually transmitted diseases.
School-based clinics and youth service centers are being set up
to provide comprehensive and integrated health and social
services. This new wave of programming has been supported by
State governments, local school districts, and private
foundations. </p>

<p> School-based clinics have been developing in response to
growing poverty, widespread lack of insurance, and increases in
health and social problems among youth. One study indicates that
the percent of adolescents defined as living in poverty increased
from 15 percent in 1979 to 19 percent in 1986 (22). Not all youth
living in poverty are covered by Medicaid or other health
insurance, and millions of other youth (e.g., in near-poor or
recently unemployed families) also lack health insurance.
Violence, teen pregnancy, and substance use and abuse remain high
or are increasing in many communities, and these problems often
require direct one-on-one medical or social interventions, if
they are to have a chance of being resolved. </p>

<p> Self-referral and other data suggest that school-based
clinics are providing health care and social support. For
example, a survey of 306 such clinics in 33 States and Puerto
Rico (22) found that about half the visits were for medical
problems, such as injuries and illnesses, with 40 percent of the
visits for counseling and 10 percent for birth control supplies
or counseling about reproductive issues more generally. No
evaluations seem yet to have focused on the effectiveness of
school-based clinics for assisting with the treatment and
prevention of substance use and abuse. School-based clinics
perhaps should not focus primarily on these problems, but as
clinics expand in numbers questions will naturally and more
frequently arise about their role in addressing substance use and
related problems. </p>

<p> Several notable collaborations between schools and other
community agencies and resources have been supported and, at
least in part, studied. For example, the Community Partnership
Program, administered by the Center for Substance Abuse
Prevention, has supported more than 250 local partnerships for
the prevention of substance use and abuse, with over 60 percent
actively involving schools as coalition members. Each site must
have a local evaluator that will monitor primarily program
activities, and a national evaluation to monitor program
activities and outcomes has begun. The local evaluations are
expected to vary widely, in part because uniform, accepted
standards for community-wide program evaluation have yet to be
developed. Outcome findings are expected by 1997. </p>

<p> The Midwest Prevention Project (116) provides and studies
school-based interventions in the greater Kansas City, Missouri,
metropolitan area and in Marion County (Indianapolis), Indiana.
Due to constraints in the study design, the evaluation results to
date speak directly only to the impact of the school-based
curricular interventions; the impact of community organization,
parental, and media components cannot be evaluated. Nonetheless,
this approach suggests the potential for communities to support
school- based prevention efforts. </p>

<p> Cities-in-Schools is a national nonprofit organization
devoted to preventing students from dropping out, through
partnerships among schools, local governments, and businesses.
Cities-in-Schools operates in 122 communities in 21 states with
384 schools participating in the program. The national
organization strives to bring health, social, and employment
services into schools across the nation, to help youth find jobs,
tutors, and counseling and to motivate them to stay in school. A
national staff assists local boards. A prominent person in
business presides over each local program, directs fund-raising,
and organizes a team of professionals to help potential dropouts.
In most programs, a case manager is assigned to each high-risk
child. Beyond these basics, programs vary greatly, focusing on a
diversity of prevention and intervention strategies. Several
Cities- in-Schools sites have achieved national attention.
Although little concrete evaluation data are available about the
effects of these programs in general or on substance use, the
model appears promising and warrants further study. </p>

<p> Changing the social or physical climate in schools may also
help reduce substance use and abuse. Future research and
evaluation studies could focus on the impacts on substance use
and abuse of this and other holistic models, such as open versus
closed campuses, alternative schools, and after- school care
programs. These models may be especially promising for high risk
youth suffering from multiple risk factors and limited protective
factors, many of which are rooted in problematic (often substance
using and abusing) homes, neighborhoods, peer groups, and other
subcultures, which cannot easily be influenced by more limited
school- based prevention approaches alone. </p>

<p> WORKPLACES </p>

<p> Workplaces can also contribute to and protect against alcohol
and drug abuse. This section reviews literature on factors and
interventions associated with substance abuse in the workplace,
with a special focus on the role of workplace settings
themselves. Researchers have investigated the causes of substance
abuse among workers for nearly four decades, and U.S. management
and labor have been concerned about workplace substance abuse for
over a century (150,158,159). Alcohol has been the drug most
studied in workplaces and appears to be the drug most commonly
used. </p>

<p> Magnitude of Problem </p>

<p> The prevalence of substance abuse among the employed remains
inadequately documented, based on a small number of flawed
studies. For American workers more information exists on the
extent of alcohol use and dependence (although gaps remain) than
on the use and abuse of illegal substances (57, 68,114). </p>

<p> The 1988 National Health Interview Survey found that about 13
percent of employed men and 6 percent of employed women were
alcohol dependent (68). This nationwide household survey of
almost 27,000 individuals found that, for both men and women, the
percentage of white-collar workers who drank was greater than the
percentage of blue-collar workers who drank. However, among those
who drank, blue-collar workers drank more than white-collar
workers. Consistent with an earlier survey in Detroit, Michigan,
alcohol-related disorders were also found to be greater among
blue-collar workers, with the rates highest for men who were
craftsmen, laborers, and service workers, and for women who were
machine operators, laborers, and service workers (114). Another
investigator has reported that the rate of on-the- job substance
use among young men in the 6 months prior to the study was about
28 percent (105). </p>

<p> Substance abuse contributes to workplace problems, such as
accidents, injuries, absenteeism, turnover, lost productivity,
compensation claims, and insurance costs (11). The total cost to
the American economy related to substance abuse has been
estimated to be more than $144 billion a year, with about 60
percent due to alcohol abuse and 40 percent due to the abuse of
other drugs (121). Costs to the economy include costs due to
medical care, prevention, law enforcement, and lost productivity.
The 1985 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found that
substance-using employees were 3.6 times more likely to have
accidents than nonusing employees. They had 2.5 times more
absences of 8 days or more. They were three times more likely to
be tardy than nonusing employees and were 2.2 times more likely
to ask for early dismissal. They requested sick leave three times
as much as nonusing employees. They were five times as likely to
file for worker compensation. The total cost of lost productivity
due to alcohol and other drug abuse has been estimated at more
than $33 billion in 1985 and a little more than $43 billion in
1988 (122). </p>

<p> Factors Affecting Individuals in Workplaces </p>

<p> Substance abuse in workplaces can be affected by nonworkplace
factors and workplace factors. </p>

<p> Nonworkplace Factors </p>

<p> Early research attributed drinking and other drug problems on
the job to factors outside the workplace. Substance abuse was
seen as a problem brought to the workplace but not caused by the
workplace, and some believed that substance abusers selected
workplaces where they could conceal their problems. This view
assumed that substance abusers had the knowledge and freedom to
choose jobs on this basis, an assumption unlikely to apply to
all, given the limits of education and work experience among many
substance abusers, especially blue-collar workers (113). In any
case, family and community experiences interact with workplace
experiences (2), and workers from families and other subgroups
that drink may find that drinking influences their work lives as
well. </p>

<p> As noted earlier, drinking problems are more common among
those with lower SES, although drinking occurs more frequently
among higher SES individuals (31). Workplaces that employ more
lower SES employees may therefore be expected to have more
alcohol abusers (157). </p>

<p> The acceptance of alcohol and other drugs in the larger
society outside the workplace can also influence substance use
and abuse in the workplace. This can be seen in the new attitudes
in American society toward smoking. Consumers used to be assailed
constantly by advertisements presenting smoking in a positive
light, but are now more informed about its negative effects on
health. As a result, smoking has been banned from many airplane
flights, restaurants, stores, and public and private workplaces. </p>

<p> The availability of alcohol in the local community from which
a work organization derives its employees can also influence
workplace drinking (157). Higher rates of drinking problems exist
in communities where alcohol is cheaply and widely available and
alcohol outlets remain open for long hours. </p>

<p> Workplace Environment Factors </p>

<p> Several decades ago, researchers distinguished four
categories of workplace factors that place employees at risk for
excessive drinking (127). They are: </p>

<p> o lack of work visibility, </p>

<p> o absence of job structure, </p>

<p> o lack of social controls that discourage alcohol use, and </p>

<p> o job stress. </p>

<p> A more recent review (157) of risk factors internal to
workplace environments identified the following elements: </p>

<p> o alienation and powerlessness, </p>

<p> o work stress, </p>

<p> o structural features of the workplace, </p>

<p> o influence of administrative subcultures, </p>

<p> o poorly implemented intervention programs, and </p>

<p> o union-management conflict. </p>

<p> It has also been suggested that individual factors and
perceived work situations may be more important for alcohol use
than objective work situations (136). Those with boring and
routine jobs, or jobs over which they have little control, may be
more likely to drink (3,76). For example, a study of auto factory
assembly line workers found that 40 percent drank alcohol at work
(129). Other research found a consistent relationship between
powerlessness and alcohol use, and no evidence that work
experience or social support moderated alcohol use (137). </p>

<p> Workplace subcultures, whether administrative or
occupational, may also encourage drinking or the use of other
drugs at work. Administrative support for heavy drinking can
exist throughout the work organization or can be limited to
specific sites or occasions. Subcultures that can support the
heavy use of alcohol, but strongly discourage the use of illicit
drugs, are found in the military (28,119). Anecdotal reports
suggest that other occupational settings have encouraged the use
of cocaine (e.g., entertainment industry). Although available
research does not support the conclusion that workplace
subcultures are the primary cause of substance abuse, there is
evidence that at least alcohol problems vary widely according to
occupation (148). </p>

<p> Workplaces can offer protective factors as well. For some,
the fact of being employed, with the income and stability and
status that employment can convey, may offer protection against
substance use and abuse. If unemployment and underemployment are
viewed as risk factors, then employment by itself, at a decent
wage in a decent job, may offer protection. In addition, the
specific characteristics of a workplace can be protective. For
example, the risk factors listed above could be viewed as the
extremes on a continuum, the other end of which could be expected
to offer protection. Thus, work visibility, job structure,
manageable stress, worker involvement and empowerment, supportive
administrators, well implemented treatment and prevention
programs, and union-management harmony could be expected to be
protective factors. </p>

<p> Interventions </p>

<p> Two primary ways of dealing with employee substance abuse and
health have emerged: traditional employee assistance programs
(EAPs), which seek to help employees with identified problems,
and health promotion programs, which seek to prevent illness and
promote health (56). </p>

<p> Employee Assistance Programs </p>

<p> EAPs help employees with personal problems at the employer's
expense, by providing services directly (through the work
organization) or indirectly (through a provider in the community)
(140). In some workplaces, for example, EAPs are located in
medical departments, which generally provide emergency medical
care and may also provide preventive or rehabilitative care.
Medical departments, however, appear to be declining as sites for
EAPs (141). </p>

<p> EAPs rely on a strategy of constructive confrontation, which
assumes that supervisors or coworkers of substance abusers will
help refer them to the EAPs. In addition, workers are encouraged
to refer themselves to EAPs for assistance. </p>

<p> A review of what works in fighting substance abuse in the
workplace stresses that an employee assistance program is a key
to a good workplace program (167). It also recommends a written
drug-free workplace policy, management and supervisory training,
drug testing in workplaces where appropriate (one example of
which is when substance abuse may be dangerous to self or
others), and employee education programs focused on substance
abuse. Testing may well prevent substance use and abuse in
workplaces. </p>

<p> Some studies suggest that EAPs can be cost-effective for
business. The Department of Labor has reported thatemployers
generally find that for every dollar invested in an EAP, savings
of from $5 to $16 are achieved (167). Other reviews of the
limited evaluations of the economic and other benefits of EAPs
have found that health care costs and absenteeism, for example,
decline after employees have been served by EAPs (178). </p>

<p> However, EAPs have also been criticized in some cases, for
their inability to reach those at greatest risk, their incomplete
coverage of lower status employees, their failures to identify
problem drinkers early enough, their inadequate handling of
situation-dependent drinking problems, and their uncertain
effectiveness in rehabilitating problem drinkers (140). The
relative lack of EAPs in medium and small workplaces is an
important constraint on the ability of EAPs to offer more
widespread protection to the employed. </p>

<p> Health Promotion Programs </p>

<p> Health promotion programs seek to prevent illness and promote
wellness through behavior change. For example, they provide
information and support activities to help individuals increase
exercise, quit smoking, change diets, and manage stress and
hypertension. There are several advantages to using such general
workplace health promotion programs to prevent substance abuse in
the context of promoting positive life-style changes for all
employees. These include: </p>

<p> o little or no stigma; </p>

<p> o the use of positive, optimistic approaches; </p>

<p> o ease in selling to employees and generating enthusiasm;
and, </p>

<p> o generous corporate financing of health promotion programs
(103). </p>

<p> The use of health promotion programs to prevent substance
abuse can also present problems, however. For example, prevention
historically has been one of the lowest priorities for Federal
funding (104). When implemented by businesses, health promotion
programs may inadequately deal with the needs of a particular
work organization's employees, since the programs often come from
outside and have not been tailored to fit the needs of a
particular group of employees. Decision makers within a workplace
may decide on the basis of intuition, whim, or trendiness to buy
a health promotion program from the increasing number of
purveyors of programs (140). Furthermore, many of the proponents
of marketed health promotion programs have failed to adequately
evaluate their programs. Unfortunately, this has been
particularly true of activities intended to prevent substance
abuse. </p>

<p> Environment-Oriented Approaches to Substance Abuse Prevention
</p>

<p> A third approach, often associated with Scandinavia, focuses
less on changing employee behaviors and more on altering
workplace factors that influence worker health. The Swedish Work
Environment Fund, established in 1972, supports research,
workplace innovations, information dissemination, and training to
achieve better working environments. Grants that support
occupational health centers and research programs in Sweden are
financed through a combination of employer fees, payroll taxes,
and government financial assistance. </p>

<p> By contrast, the goal of alcohol policy in the workplace in
the United States has for centuries been to change individual
drinking behavior (1). Researchers have recently begun to focus
on how the workplace environment influences problem drinking. The
Harvard School of Public Health, jointly funded by the National
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation, is surveying thousands of managers and work
groups in up to 10 large multinational corporations (171). The
study will determine corporate and work site patterns of
drinking, levels of work site drinking problems as they relate to
attitudes and practices of management, how corporate culture
affects managerial behavior and drinking problems in the
workplace, and what role the work group plays in promoting or
preventing problem drinking. </p>

<p> RECREATIONAL SETTINGS </p>

<p> Recreational and other developmental activities and settings
may also contribute to the prevention of substance use and abuse,
or by their absence increase the risk. Examples of such
recreational and other developmental activities and settings
include Boys and Girls Clubs, Boy and Girl Scouts, organized
sports, cultural activities, and local park and recreation
department programs. </p>

<p> Organized Activities and Drug Abuse </p>

<p> Research on the impact of organized youth activities on
substance use and abuse is limited, and only a few studies have
addressed the issue directly, while others have addressed it more
indirectly. </p>

<p> One study (which relied extensively on reports from employees
of Boys and Girls Clubs) found that public housing developments
served by Clubs had 22 percent less drug activity than
developments not served by Clubs. The presence of crack in
particular was 25 percent lower, and even lower in developments
served by new Clubs with SMART Moves, a substance abuse
prevention program (133). </p>

<p> A more extensive investigation has been conducted by the
Search Institute, which has surveyed 180,000 6th through 12th
grade youth in 430 school districts since 1988. Analysis of the
data found that as developmental assets increased (including
involvement in music, school team sports, nonsport school-based
cocurricular activities, nonschool clubs or organizations, and
churches) at-risk behaviors decreased, including the use of
alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs (12). Specifically, the
correlations: </p>

<p> o tend to be small; </p>

<p> o are strongest for tobacco use and weakest for alcohol use;
and, </p>

<p> o are slightly higher for church involvement than for other
activities. </p>

<p> Involvement in youth programs and activities has been found
to be associated with fewer at-risk behaviors among youth. One
study found that higher levels of four youth assets (perceived
positive school climate, family support, involvement in
structured youth activities, and involvement in church or
synagogue) were associated with lower levels of 20 at-risk
indicators, contained mainly in eight at-risk domains (alcohol,
tobacco, illicit drugs, sexuality, depression/suicide, antisocial
behavior, school, and vehicle safety) (12). High school students
who listed no assets, for example, reported an average of 5.6
at-risk indicators, while students listing all 4 assets reported
only 1.7 at- risk indicators. </p>

<p> A study of different communities found that 55 percent of the
youth in the healthier communities (defined by fewer at- risk
behaviors among youth) were involved in structured activities,
whereas only 39 percent of the youth in the least healthy
communities were involved in such activities (19). </p>

<p> Qualitative assessments across prevention disciplines support
these findings. For example, although a review and analysis of
delinquency, adolescent pregnancy, substance abuse, and school
failure and dropout prevention programs did not directly
investigate connections between youth development programs and
substance abuse prevention, its authors concluded that the
elements in youth development organizations can play a critical
role in preventing each of these problem behaviors (48). </p>

<p> The Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development has identified
several successful prevention efforts launched by national
youth-serving organizations, including the adolescent pregnancy
efforts of the Association of Junior Leagues and of Girls, Inc.,
and found that participation in such programs was associated with
fewer at-risk behaviors (32). The Carnegie Council's Task Force
on Youth Development and Community Programs concluded that, taken
together, current social science theory and field evaluations
provide a solid rationale for strengthening and expanding the
role of community-based programs in promoting healthy adolescent
development, since unsupervised after-school hours represent a
period of significant risk, with young adolescents standing a
greater chance of engaging in substance abuse. </p>

<p> Another study tested whether inactivity or boredom was
associated with substance abuse. It compared adolescents who had
been clinically diagnosed as substance abusers with a comparison
group of nonsubstance abusers, and found that the substance
abusers experienced their leisure activities as more boring, even
though they had participated in more leisure activities
(including such activities as going to concerts and going for a
drive). Available leisure activities may, for some youth, fail to
satisfy &quot;their need for optimal arousal,&quot; leaving them
more vulnerable to the appeal of drugs (78). </p>

<p> Thus, being active does not by itself protect against
substance abuse. Some activities, such as those that are
unstructured and unsupervised, may even increase the risks of
substance use and abuse through association with a wider range of
peers, some of whom are using substances. In addition, activities
perceived as boring may not protect against substance use and
abuse. More research is needed, to clarify the aspects of
recreational and other leisure activities that may protect
against substance use and abuse. Research might profitably focus
on whether activities that are supervised, structured, drug-free,
empowering, skills- building, self-esteem-promoting, active,
shared, and nonboring (or some combination of those) are
associated with lower levels of substance use and abuse. </p>

<p> Elements of Notable Programs </p>

<p> Several of the most important elements of notable substance
abuse prevention programs are provided by youth development
programs as well. These include: </p>

<p> o Promoting social and life skills. Programs that rely
exclusively on transmitting information about the health, legal,
and social risks of substance use and abuse are generally
ineffective (79). If, as the author of a recent longitudinal
study contends, substance use is a symptom rather than a cause of
personal and social maladjustment, promoting social and
psychological well-being may help prevent substance abuse (66).
Many alcohol and other drug prevention programs focus on the
development of social and life skills, as a way to help youth
understand their emotions, control their anger, curb
aggressiveness, and presumably reduce their inclination to turn
to substances (66,166). </p>

<p> o Strengthening families. Increasingly, alcohol and other
drug prevention programs are recognizing and addressing family
factors. Youth development organizations afford opportunities for
involving parents in recreational and other nonschool, nonfamily
activities. </p>

<p> o Promoting healthy peer interactions. Several studies have
shown the value of using peers as role models in prevention
programs. One study conducted a meta-analysis of 143 adolescent
drug prevention programs and collapsed prevention programs into 5
strategies or types: knowledge only, affective (i.e., addressing
feelings) only, peer programs, knowledge plus affective, and
alternatives. Peer programs that highlight peer influences and
emphasize skill building were found to be the most successful
(156). Peers are often the best positioned to help others build
resistance skills and bring about significant results in reducing
substance use, as compared to teachers or other adults. Peer
counseling and student assistance programs, for example, offer
unique opportunities for youth to cope with difficult issues and
develop skills to resist peer pressure (33). </p>

<p> o Indirect and participatory approaches to substance use.
Substance prevention programs are more likely to be effective if
they develop creative ways to reach and connect with their
participants. Many programs incorporate lessons concerning
substance use into activities such as games, theatrical
performances, creative arts, and sports. Some programs avoid
stating in their names that they are focusing on substance use
prevention, and in this way often attract more youth and preclude
them from feeling stigmatized (161). Because youth spend so much
time in school, where didactic, lecturing approaches so often
predominate, these approaches may well be less effective in
nonschool activities. GAO has recommended that programs engage
youth in activities that are more motivational and participatory,
such as support groups, dramatic productions, leadership
training, and role- playing (161). </p>

<p> o Alternative activities. Communities are beginning to create
healthy, substance-free alternative activities, such as teen
centers or drug-free parties, for youth who may feel there is
nothing else to do. This alternatives approach grows from the
idea that youth who turn to substances to meet certain social and
psychological needs can meet those needs in more positive and
healthy ways without chemicals. In its guide book, Prevention
Plus III, CSAP stresses the importance of incentives for youth to
participate in such alternative activities. At a minimum,
activities should reflect the interests and preferences of the
youth involved. A 10-year study with over 500 subjects found that
the largest percentage (67 percent) of assuredly recovered
substance abusers, defined as those who have been clean for five
years, used alternative activities to cope with or improve their
moods (169). However, although it remains a promising strategy,
many agree that more substantial research is needed. </p>

<p> The elements of notable programs suggest that youth
development organizations may be able to play a greater role in
the prevention of substance abuse. First, they can provide
specific information about substances and training in refusal
skills. Second, they can address life skills development,
emotional issues, and academic remediation. Further, they can
involve both youth and their families, as well as peers, in
settings for collaborative, substance-free interactions. Research
has shown the importance of building supportive communities
through such networks of social support that can diminish
substance use and abuse and promote healthy youth development
(14,19,133). PLANNING, IMPLEMENTING, AND EVALUATING
COMMUNITY-WIDE PROGRAMS </p>

<p> If substance abuse and addiction problems in a particular
community affect individuals via multiple risk and protective
factors interacting in multiple settings, then efforts to prevent
these problems may require multipronged efforts involving
schools, parents, media messages, and other community resources
(116). While it is possible that an assessment of problems may be
carried out by relatively few individuals, it is extremely
unlikely that the planning, implementation, and evaluation of
community-wide efforts can be achieved without participation of
residents and leaders throughout the community. Widespread
coordination and cooperation are intrinsic to community-wide
efforts. To help achieve such community-wide coordination and
cooperation, several different types of community coalitions have
been created. The CSAP has studied the ability of 7 pilot test
communities, under Community Partnership grants, to gather
information on 15 community-wide indicators of alcohol and other
drug abuse (see table 8-3). Some of these indicators are directly
related to and measure the extent of substance abuse and
addiction among subpopulations in a community (e.g., number of
drug positive urine samples from pregnant women at time of
delivery). Some of the indicators measure the extent of behaviors
or outcomes that may be directly related to substance abuse
(e.g., number of single vehicle nighttime accidents and number of
deaths due to alcohol and other drugs). Some of the CSAP
indicators relate to community activity settings, such as
workplaces and schools. </p>

<p> CSAP has recently supported, through the Community
Partnership program and the High-Risk Youth program, the use of
nonquantitative techniques to gain insights into substance abuse
and addiction and related problems in communities. This
information can be garnered by ethnographers and citizen
informants, who can report on the values, attitudes, purposes,
behaviors, and experiences of individuals in the subcultures of
communities. </p>

<p> The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has funded 13 community
coalitions in its &quot;Fighting Back&quot; program to reduce
substance abuse and addiction. About 600 coalitions now belong to
a national organization, Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of
America (CADCA). Some coalitions have been formed to address
other health and social issues, including the ASSIST and COMMIT
community tobacco control programs, funded by the National
Institutes of Health, and the Planned Approach to Community
Health (PATCH) program, funded by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention to encourage local coalitions for community health
planning and implementation (29). HUD now has funds to support
Community Coalitions Against Crime, which also address substance
abuse and addiction. And CSAP has supported numerous activities
conducted by approximately 250 coalitions through its Community
Partnership program (see table 8-4). </p>

<p> A recent review of some of the Community Partnerships
revealed the wide range of activities they have so far
implemented, including general prevention programs, public
education, alternative activities, community organizing and
empowerment, advocacy for policy change, and other community
activities. </p>

<p> Although coalitions have not been extensively evaluated as
yet, and although the evaluations that are now in process will
not produce outcome results for several years, there is reason to
believe that community coalitions offer promise for
community-wide efforts to prevent substance abuse and addiction.
First, as documented by this report, the factors contributing to
substance abuse and addiction are multiple and interactive.
Second, these factors interact in subcultures and community
activity settings that can encourage or inhibit substance abuse
and addiction and are widely dispersed. Thus, especially in
communities severely impacted by these problems, multiple efforts
addressing multiple factors in multiple settings may be required.
A recent report from the General Accounting Office concluded that
&quot;preliminary research results indicated that a
community-based approach may hold promise in preventing drug
use,&quot; and went on to emphasize the need for comprehensive
evaluations of such efforts (162). </p>

<p> Community coalitions could make use of the framework in this
report to develop plans for preventive interventions addressing
targeted populations in selected community activity settings.
Building on a systematic quantitative and nonquantitative
assessment of needs, a coalition could identify optional
preventive interventions that address selected populations and
settings, and then phase them in as resources permit. However,
some community coalitions may need additional support and
technical assistance to help them resolve conflicts, form
consensus on goals and plans, and sustain cooperative,
coordinated efforts that are subject to more rigorous evaluations
and midcourse corrections. Each community coalition needs to take
a critical look at what works and what does not work, and needs
to be flexible enough to try promising and proven analytical and
programmatic technologies, even if they are somewhat new to the
coalition. </p>

<p> SUMMARY </p>

<p> This chapter has reviewed research on factors and
interventions relevant to the onset and prevention of substance
use, abuse, and addiction in the four principal community
activity settings--homes and families, schools and peers,
workplaces, and recreational and other community settings.
Research indicates that families may influence whether family
members, especially (but not limited to) the young, initiate
substance use and progress to abuse and dependency, and can be
the target of a wide range of increasingly tested preventive
interventions that can help family members resist the use of
substances. Similarly, schools, especially through peer group
norms and behaviors related to substance use, can also be
important locations for the onset of substance use (including
alcohol use) and for preventive interventions, especially those
that focus on social influences, including peers. Factors in
workplaces, although less studied, can also contribute to and
protect against substance use and abuse, and workplace
interventions that focus on individuals and environments provide
opportunities for prevention. Finally, an emerging literature on
the role of recreational settings and activities, especially for
youth, suggests that the availability of attractive and
compelling substance-free activities can play a role in
dissuading youth from becoming heavily involved in the use and
abuse of substances. </p>

<p> BOX 8-2: Janice Janice, a 28-year-old, white, married female,
was inoutpatient treatment for bulimia nervosa, a
binge-purgepattern of eating that began when she was 18 years
old. Shealso had an intermittent history of alcohol abuse
datingfrom midadolescence. Janice appeared to be well-motivated
intreatment. She used the psychoeducational approach taught byher
therapist to increase her knowledge of how her binge-eating and
moodiness were related to her restricted dailycaloric intake. She
made progress quickly, using cognitivebehavioral techniques to
challenge her distortions andunderstand her behavior; she began
to eat consistent mealsin adequate amounts. These changes led to
a decrease in herbinge-eating and self-induced vomiting. However,
along withthis progress she became increasingly anxious, fearful,
andagitated about weight gain (despite the fact that little
ornone had occurred). At the same time, she became overwhelmedby
the intensity of the feelings she experienced, was havingbad
dreams, and withdrew from her support system in waysthat angered
her friends. She once more resorted toinconsistent meal patterns,
dieting, poor nutrition, and--inevitably--binge-eating and
vomiting. Her alcohol useincreased.Janice's symptomatology
shifted once she significantlydecreased her bulimic behavior.
Instead of dealing witheveryday feelings, behavior, and thoughts,
she began torelive memories from her unresolved traumatic past.
Thesememories started with vague feelings of uneasiness,
whichgrew more intense as she binged less. She then began
toremember her dreams, which, as they came into clearer
focus,caused her to be suspicious of her friends, and
particularlyof the men around her. Janice reported feeling fine
oneminute and then very frightened the next. Whereas she usedto
be flattered by any male attention, she now felt fearfulwhen men
looked at her. She started to remember multiplesexual assaults in
her past, both by persons known to herand by strangers. She felt
increasing urges to suicide, andobserved the reality of her
internal suffering as being &quot;tooawful.&quot; As she said,
&quot;If this is what recovery is all about,I don't think it's
worth it; I'll take my chances andstruggle with addictions. If I
can't stand that, there'salways suicide.&quot;SOURCE: M.P. Root,

fromproperly caring for herself and the children. Dara rentedthe
upstairs apartment in her parent's home. Her
19-year-oldboyfriend, Brian, spent a great deal of time with her
andChristina.I helped Dara find out about drug treatment centers
and aschedule for Narcotic Anonymous (N.A.). She missed her
firstdrug evaluation because of having an abortion. She and
Brianwent to one N.A. meeting and then missed many days. The
CPScaseworker met with me and Dara and stressed the importanceof
her drug recovery. Dara agreed to complete the evaluationas well
as attend N.A. meetings. Initially I accompanied herto the N.A.
meetings for moral support. Sometimes Brianwould go and the rest
of the time her mother would accompanyher. Dara successfully
completed her drug evaluation andattended regular counseling
sessions with a drug counselor.She volunteered for urinalysis,
&quot;just to keep her honest.&quot;Dara got involved with other
young adults in N.A. They wentto eat together and went out to
dances and movies. She beganassociating with a new peer group.
The CPS caseworkerauthorized maximum day-care to be paid for so
she couldattend her meetings and counseling. Dara's

UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND ADDICTION US
Government Office of Technology Assessment </b>October 18, 1994 <b><font
size="5">CHAPTER 4 - AVAILABILITY <img
src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"></font></b> </p>

<p> Availability is a precondition for drug abuse and dependency.
A person cannot become a drug abuser unless a drug is available
to be used. </p>

<p> Drug availability is often thought of as mere physical
presence of an abusable substance. In addition, however,
availability is affected by social norms (social availability),
prices (economic availability), and personal values (subjective
availability) (see table 4-1). Marketing techniques for both
licit and illicit drugs can alter social, economic, and
subjective availability, and thus are addressed in this chapter
(see box 4-1). </p>

<p> A substantial body of literature addressing the relationship
between drug availability and drug demand does exist. However,
most of this information addresses tobacco and alcohol, rather
than illicit drugs. In addition to conducting a literature search
(primarily of mass media), the Office of Technology Assessment
(OTA) contracted with the National Center for Juvenile Justice
(NCJJ) to conduct a survey of juvenile probation officers on the
perceived availability of drugs and to conduct a workshop on
availability issues (see appendix F for a list of participants). </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY </p>

<p> Availability is a concept usually reserved for the supply-
side of the substance abuse policy equation (i.e., making drugs
available to supply an already existing demand). However, the
proximity of drugs and drug dealers to potential users, and the
ease with which these substances can be purchased or otherwise
obtained can affect demand, use, and abuse. This is especially
true when one considers aggressive marketing efforts by
suppliers, who seek to create or expand the demand for drugs by
convincing potential consumers of the benefits, acceptability,
and availability of these substances. While availability is a
concept that applies to the whole range of drugs, most of what we
know about its role in drug use and abuse comes from research in
the arena of alcohol and tobacco abuse (1,9,10,14) (see box 4-2
and figure 4-1). </p>

<p> Research has shown that when alcohol is more available, the
prevalence of drinking, the amount of alcohol consumed, and the
heavy use of alcohol all increase (5). Alternatively, the
literature also suggests that physical conditions that restrict
alcohol availability reduce rates of alcohol consumption (1). A
review of alcohol-related literature reveals that availability
can be conceptualized in four different, yet related categories. </p>

<p> Physical Availability </p>

<p> Physical availability refers to a basic element--the
proximity and accessibility of an abusable substance. Simple
logic dictates that if a substance is absent, it cannot be used.
Government interdiction and law enforcement policies target the
physical availability of illicit drugs. Other policies, such as
limitations on the point-of-sale, hours, or age of purchasers,
target the physical availability of other abusable drugs, such as
tobacco and alcohol products. </p>

<p> Responses to the OTA survey of juvenile probation
administrators indicated that respondents perceived two ways in
which physical availability is increased: through contamination
by outsiders (e.g., youth gangs, tourists, foreigners) bringing
drugs into the community, and through proximity to a source of
drugs or alcohol. </p>

<p> Gangs and organized drug trafficking were mentioned often by
respondents as reasons for increases in the availability of
drugs. Respondents from all over the country, representing both
rural and urban areas, registered concerns about gangs and their
role in marketing and trafficking drugs. A respondent from
Canton, Mississippi, for example, attributed the increase in drug
availability simply to &quot;gang leaders from California.&quot;
A respondent from Waterbury, Connecticut, was more explicit about
the age and ethnicity of the gang influences, attributing the
observed increase in drugs to the &quot;emergence of gang
activity for the 12-to-15-year-old age group, particularly in the
Hispanic and black ethnic groupings.&quot; A respondent from
Paducah, Kentucky, said that the &quot;increase in drugs has been
from gangs entering the community from Memphis, Tennessee,
Arkansas, and Chicago, Illinois.&quot; The respondent from
Davenport, Iowa, attributed the increase to attempts by
&quot;Chicago gang members to establish crack markets in Quad
Cities--lots of arrests of Chicago residents including
juveniles.&quot; Even cities with an established history of youth
gangs identified gangs as being responsible for increases in
drugs. For example, a respondent from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
attributed the observed increase to the fact that &quot;gang
participation has become increasingly sophisticated.&quot; </p>

<p> However, gangs were not the only phenomena associated with
increasing the physical availability of drugs and alcohol. Many
respondents were concerned with the potential for contamination
due to proximity to areas thought to be established drug markets
or through proximity to the means for widespread drug
distribution (e.g., major highways and roads, prisons). </p>

<p> Physical availability is necessary but not solely responsible
for drug use. For example, drugs often are physically available
but are not always used. Also, seeking to prevent or reduce drug
use solely by eliminating or reducing physical availability may
be doomed to failure, since it has proven to be very difficult to
keep drugs out of communities. So although the concept of
physical availability is important, it is limited, both as a
cause and a cure to drug use and abuse. </p>

<p> Economic Availability </p>

<p> Economic availability may be increased when a person has
access to surplus income or the costs of drugs are low, illegal
drug sales are a key component of the local economy, or the price
per unit of a drug or drugs in general is reduced. In describing
the difference between &quot;private&quot; and
&quot;flagrant&quot; drug markets, one article specified some of
the dimensions of the changing economics of addiction: </p>

<p> If cigarettes were sold only by the carton and whiskey only
by the case, the effect would be to decrease the total
consumption of tobacco and whiskey. Presumably, few people would
start smoking cigarettes if the first experimental purchase were
a $20 carton rather than a $1 pack. Similarly, fewer poor people
would drink if they were required to buy whiskey by the case. A
similar effect would, in all likelihood, hold true if open air
and flagrant drug markets were eliminated (3). </p>

<p> In addition to overall conditions, economic availability of
all substances can be affected by the pricing of products. For
licit products such as alcohol and tobacco, economic availability
is also affected by taxes levied by federal, state, and local
authorities. </p>

<p> In 1989, federal excise taxes on tobacco, alcoholic
beverages, and motor fuels raised $24.4 billion in revenue--
about 2.5 percent of total federal revenues (11). Excise
taxes--taxes on specific products--while representing a small
part of total taxes, are an important consideration in the
economic availability of licit substances. </p>

<p> Excise taxes are seen by many as having three impacts: </p>

<p> o to raise revenue for government programs; </p>

<p> o to make certain harmful substances less affordable and,
hence, less used and abused; and </p>

<p> o to cover societal costs that accrue from the use of various
substances (e.g., environmental costs from the use of gasoline,
health costs resulting from smoking and drinking). </p>

<p> Whether taxation of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products
is an appropriate means of reducing societal costs caused by
their use is a continuing public debate. Some argue that the
public health costs and other external costs are so significant
as to justify substantial excise taxes. Others counter that such
taxes are regressive--impacting the poor more than the rich--and
reduce the satisfaction experienced by millions of sensible
drinkers without necessarily reducing the harm caused by
excessive drinkers (8). </p>

<p> Social Availability </p>

<p> Social availability refers to those factors within the
community conducive to drug use. One study explored alternative
explanations for reported declines in cocaine use among high
school seniors, using questionnaire data from annual nationwide
surveys conducted from 1976 to 1988 (2). Results of this analysis
indicated that although lifestyle factors showed strong links
with the use of marijuana and cocaine, these factors had not
developed trends in ways that could account for declines in the
use of either drug. Reported physical availability of either drug
had not been reduced. Instead, increases in perceived risks and
disapproval appear to have contributed substantially to the
recent declines in the use of marijuana and cocaine. The study
concluded that it was important to lower demand by reducing
social availability, as opposed to trying to reduce supply by
reducing physical availability. </p>

<p> Increasingly, grass roots community action groups are working
to diminish both the subjective and social domains of
availability. These efforts usually entail developing and
presenting public awareness and fact-based education to consumers
and potential consumers, decreasing community tolerance for drug
use while increasing collective pride in the community, and
developing or otherwise demonstrating alternatives to substance
use and abuse. </p>

<p> Subjective Availability </p>

<p> Subjective availability encompasses individual differences in
how people perceive their access to substances. For example, an
individual may choose to use one type of abusable substance, but
not another. Or, an individual may choose to use a drug (e.g.,
cocaine), but only in certain forms (i.e., a person may choose to
snort a line of cocaine but refuse to smoke or inject it). The
person who refuses to use illicit drugs has interjected his or
her personal values in a way to make illicit drugs unavailable,
even if they are physically and economically available. </p>

<p> One reviewer identified four components of subjective
availability as it relates to alcohol: 1) willingness to go out
of one's way to purchase alcohol, 2) perceived convenience of
buying alcohol, 3) discomfort about buying alcohol, and
4)?importance of the price of alcohol. Subjective and social
availability were demonstrated to have direct influences on
alcohol consumption, and subjective and social aspects of
availability can mediate and outweigh the influence of physical
availability (1). </p>

<p> Subjective availability is likely to increase when an
individual holds attitudes or values favorable toward use; lives
in a community that condones, or even celebrates, drug use; and
has ready access to drugs that are highly valued, particularly if
those agents are addictive. </p>

<p> ARE DRUGS READILY AVAILABLE? </p>

<p> A number of surveys exists for measuring drug use (see
chapter 2). In addressing the question of whether drugs are
readily available, several measures exist (e.g., marketing
figures related to alcohol and tobacco sales, tallies of illegal
drugs seized by law enforcement authorities). In addition to
quantitative measures of drug use, many people perceive various
drugs to be widely available. In an attempt to measure these
anecdotal perceptions, OTA surveyed juvenile probation
administrators randomly selected from a database maintained by
NCJJ. </p>

<p> The purpose of the survey was to identify communities that
have experienced a sudden, observable change in the abuse of
drugs or alcohol in the past 12 months and to collect preliminary
data about the events and circumstances leading to the change in
abuse. Such anecdotal evidence could be gathered from a number of
groups; OTA chose to survey juvenile justice officials because of
their involvement in drug issues and the availability of a
nationwide database of such officials who could be accessed. </p>

<p> Responses were received from 246 juvenile justice
administrators across 38 States. The data provide a glimpse at
some of the drug and alcohol availability issues being addressed
by juvenile courts and probation departments across the United
States. Seven findings resulted from the survey: </p>

<p> o Most respondents consider substance abuse to be a serious
problem in their communities. Using a scale of 1 (not serious) to
10 (very serious), the respondents, on average, rated the problem
of substance abuse among juveniles in their communities at 7.4.
In addition, 85.8 percent of the respondents rated substance
abuse seriousness at six or above. </p>

<p> o Almost half of the respondents indicated a dramatic
increase in availability of drugs and/or alcohol in their
communities. A total of 46.7 percent of the survey respondents
reported a dramatic increase in the availability of drugs and/or
alcohol in their communities. Some 50.8 percent of the
respondents indicated &quot;no dramatic changes&quot; in
perceived availability of drugs and/or alcohol. Only 2.4 percent
indicated a dramatic decrease in availability. </p>

<p> o Factors affecting physical availability (i.e., sales and/or
distribution of drugs) were selected most often and were rated
highest in terms of increasing availability of drugs. Given an
opportunity to select and rate commonly cited reasons for
increased availability of drugs and alcohol, the respondents
selected items that were strongly associated with the sales and
distribution of drugs and alcohol (see table 4-2). </p>

<p> o Crack cocaine and cocaine were much more likely than other
drugs to show dramatic increases in availability. Respondents
were given an opportunity to report whether they had noticed a
change (ranging from a dramatic decrease to a dramatic increase)
in the availability of a range of drugs, including alcohol. Crack
(24.5 percent) and cocaine (17.8 percent) had the highest
percentage of respondents indicating a &quot;dramatic
increase&quot; in availability. The next closest were inhalants
at 14.6 percent (see table 4-3). </p>

<p> o Economic conditions and the perceived lack of real
opportunities for many youths were frequently cited as factors
contributing to the increased availability of drugs in many
communities (see box 4-3). </p>

<p> o Survey respondents listed several factors contributing to a
sense of social availability, including lack of parental/guardian
supervision, consequences for alcohol and drug offenses,
alternative activities, as well as portrayals of alcohol and drug
use by the mass media as a glamorous and healthy activity (see
box 4-4). </p>

<p> o Substance abuse prevention and early intervention efforts
were rated highest as important community responses to increases
in the availability of drugs and alcohol. Over 80 percent of
respondents agreed that an increase in prevention and
intervention efforts was an important response to an increase in
the availability of drugs. Trailing behind prevention and early
intervention were increased law enforcement (68.4 percent),
increased treatment (68.2 percent), and stiffer judicial
penalties (68.0 percent). Respondents were also asked to rate the
relative effectiveness of the listed responses to availability on
a scale of 1 (not effective) to 10 (very effective). Prevention
and early intervention (6.4 percent) was rated the highest in
terms of perceived effectiveness, but not much higher than law
enforcement (6.2 percent), increased treatment (6.0 percent), and
stiffer judicial penalties (6.2 percent) (see table 4-4). </p>

<p> MARKETING </p>

<p> Standard marketing strategies used to increase consumption of
legal goods are used in equally effective ways to increase
consumption of illicit drugs. Marketing refers to efforts by
individuals interested in the sale or trade of a product to
maintain or increase sales by maintaining market shares and
opening new markets. Marketing includes efforts to increase the
perceived availability of a product or products by enhancing the
sense of both subjective and social availability in prospective
consumers. To the extent that those efforts are successful, then
purveyors of consumer products will attempt to make the supply
match the demand (physical availability) at a cost that maximizes
both sales to consumers (economic availability) and profits to
the sellers. </p>

<p> Illegal Drugs </p>

<p> Illegal drugs are marketed aggressively in the United States.
Some of the strategies for marketing illicit drugs are very
similar to those strategies for marketing licit products.
Sometimes the distinction between licit and illicit products is
difficult to determine. Take, for example, the case of so-called
head shops. Drug paraphernalia are items sold specifically to
promote the preparation, manufacture, or marketing of drugs. Head
shops may sell a wide variety of products that are often
associated with specific drugs, for example: </p>

<p> o Stash cases, rolling machines, pipes, bongs (marijuana). </p>

<p> o Bottles, concert kits, brass straws, spoons (cocaine). </p>

<p> o Glass pipes, vials, stems, screens, shaker bottles (crack
cocaine). </p>

<p> o Testing kits, scales, adulterants (heroin). </p>

<p> o Canisters, balloons, tanks (inhalants). </p>

<p> Head shops represent the most shrewd form of pro-drug
marketing by targeting mostly young customers and providing the
technology and products required to increase the ability of users
to procure, prepare, hide, and ingest drugs. Despite Federal
legislation prohibiting the sale of drug paraphernalia (18 USC
Ap4), heads shops continue to flourish. These shops can avoid the
intention of the law because the definition of what constitutes
drug paraphernalia is ambiguous and open to interpretation. Head
shop owners will simply emphasize the legitimate use of their
products. For example, they may sell a scale designed to weigh
drugs as a product to weigh food for dieting purposes.
Specifically, head shops contribute to the drug abuse problem by:
</p>

<p> o sending a double message--if drugs are so bad, why is drug
paraphernalia sold openly? </p>

<p> o operating, in some cases, in the guise of candy stores,
exposing children to drug paraphernalia and stimulating curiosity
about drugs; </p>

<p> o serving to facilitate the use, marketing, and sale of
drugs; </p>

<p> o selling items designed as conversation pieces which serve
to glamorize drug use; and </p>

<p> o becoming hubs for drug abusers, indirectly serving to
increase crime in the neighborhoods in which they operate. </p>

<p> Another example of a marketing strategy used for licit
substances and now being adapted for illicit substances is total
marketing, which consists of four basic strategies-- promotion,
product, price, and place--to maximize theexposure of a product
in a positive light to the most likely consumer groups (4). </p>

<p> A key component of total marketing is promotion, or
advertising particular product lines to appeal to particular
subpopulations of the consuming public. Promotion is a standard
practice in the marketing of legitimate products-- it is also a
very powerful force for manipulating consumer habits. </p>

<p> Promotion includes activities like advertising and
sponsorship of sporting and entertainment events (7). For illicit
drugs, promotional activities may include sponsoring a party in
which the illegal drug is dispensed free or at a dramatic
discount along with other attractions (e.g., sex, drug
paraphernalia) (15). </p>

<p> Total marketing also entails the development of a product
line that can be targeted to subpopulations within the larger
consumer community. For example, alcohol and tobacco
manufacturers will produce an array of products targeted at
several consumer groups--premium beers for one group, wine
coolers for another, rugged masculine cigarettes for one group,
thin feminine cigarettes for another. Similarly, purveyors of
illegal drugs have begun to develop product lines--powdered
cocaine for one group, crack cocaine for another. The use of
brand names is one technique used by marketers to establish a
niche in the larger market, which is one reason people become
unwilling participants in the marketing wars between Coke and
Pepsi or Visa and American Express or even Bud and Bud Light. </p>

<p> A great deal of uniformity exists in the price, quantity, and
quality of drugs sold in the same city, especially in the same
neighborhood or street market. As a result, a dealer will
occasionally try to capture a larger share of the market by
increasing the weight or strength of the product and applying a
brand name for recognition (3). </p>

<p> In Washington, DC, for example, brand name heroin is sold
under the name of &quot;Smurf,&quot; &quot;Mr. T,&quot;
&quot;Brown Wrapper,&quot; and &quot;Black Poison.&quot;
Phencyclidine (PCP) is occasionally sold under the brand name
&quot;Hinkley&quot; (after John Hinkley, the man who shot Ronald
Reagan), &quot;Gofer&quot; (a reference to a television character
on the &quot;Love Boat,&quot; which is a popular street name for
PCP), and &quot;Keys to St. E's&quot; (a reference to a local
mental institution). Crack cocaine is sometimes hawked under the
brand names of &quot;Conan,&quot; &quot;007,&quot; and
&quot;Baseball.&quot; </p>

<p> Pricing is the process of assigning a retail cost to each
item in a given product-line that matches the ability of the
targeted subgroup to pay. By producing a line of products at a
wide range of prices, the purveyor of the goods can maximize the
consumer population. For example, whether a consumer of tobacco
products is smoking low-priced generic cigarettes from the
supermarket or high-priced cigarettes from the tobacconist, that
individual is included in the range of consumers. Illegal drug
sellers also price their particular products to move. For
example, while powdered cocaine may be too expensive for some
economically disadvantaged consumers to purchase regularly,
almost everyone can afford a $5 vial of crack cocaine. Drug
dealers also manipulate the cost for their goods to attract
customers. </p>

<p> Once a product has been developed, promoted, and priced to
move, a place must be found to most effectively sell the product.
Legal nonmedical drugs are packaged and made available at retail
outlets in such a way as to make their purchase as convenient as
possible. </p>

<p> Wine coolers, for example, are a type of beverage aimed
particularly at women and young people. With its sweet, light
taste, low prices, and convenient packaging, the wine cooler
competes with beer and soft drinks for occasions such as picnics
and sports events, where traditional wine products are unlikely
to be consumed. Wine cooler ads promote just these types of uses.
Packaging has taken on a beer or soft drink look, and the
industry is successfully obtaining access to convenience stores
and supermarket outlets to make purchases easier (6). </p>

<p> Illicit drugs can also be packaged and made available at
&quot;retail&quot; outlets where purchasers can conveniently
obtain the product(s) of their choice. One news account suggests
that &quot;mass marketing that would have made McDonald's
proud&quot; is responsible for the evolution of crack cocaine
from a drug derided as &quot;garbage rock&quot; just a few years
ago into a national craze. </p>

<p> Crack was not invented, it was created by a sharp crowd of
sinister geniuses who took a simple production technique to make
a packaged, ready to consume form of the product with low unit
price to entice massive numbers of consumers. Cocaine powder
required an investment of nearly $75 for a gram, but a hit of
crack costs as little as $5. Equally alluring was crack's
incredible &quot;high&quot;--an instantaneous euphoria because it
was smoked--that could create addicts in weeks (16). </p>

<p> Two kinds of retail drug markets exist in the United States:
the private market place and the open-air or flagrant drug
markets (3). The private drug market involves transactions that
occur between people who are known to one another or are referred
by a trusted acquaintance. Referrals in the private marketplace
are usually not very far removed from the original connection;
they may be classmates in college, business associates,
relatives, or persons belonging to the same club. </p>

<p> The familiarity of the parties in the private drug market
usually means that there is a reduced level of public exposure
and violence. The desire to keep the flow of traffic to the site
of transactions at a minimum means that sales in the private
marketplace tend to be of larger quantities of drugs than those
in street transactions. Because most of the transactions take
place &quot;behind closed doors&quot; or in some other
clandestine fashion, a high degree of impermeability exists in
the dealer-customer relationship (3). Examples of private drug
markets include &quot;speak easies&quot; during prohibition and
the &quot;traditional&quot; (i.e., before crack) cocaine markets.
</p>

<p> Another aspect of the private drug market is the ritualistic
aspect of procuring the product. Consider, for example, the
ritual associated with purchasing cocaine. One author describes
&quot;a day in the office&quot; of a street-level cocaine
distribution network. The office itself is a highly structured
operation, complete with receptionists to screen potential
customers, guards, a &quot;catcher&quot;--held on retainer to
retrieve cocaine thrown out of a window during a bust-- and the
merchant who sets prices, arranges to barter goods and services,
gives credit, and makes day-to-day decisions regarding sales
(15). </p>

<p> A typical transaction involves a positive identification of
the buyer, a greeting and brief social contact (e.g., handshake,
hug, kiss) between the merchant and the buyer, a formal request
for an amount of cocaine, and a discussion of method of payment
(e.g., cash, barter). Sometimes the transaction involves a brief
discussion of the relative quality of the drugs in the street, a
sample of the drug available from this particular merchant, and
possibly some haggling over price. The public weighing and
packaging of the cocaine is central to this type of transaction.
The scale, in fact, becomes a central point of power and
authority in the business; only those with the highest level of
trust and respect can operate the scale (15). </p>

<p> Open air and flagrant drug markets, on the other hand, tend
to be far more impersonal and much less ritualistic than the
private marketplace. Many of the concepts used by mass marketers
of licit products are used in the flagrant marketplace--targeted
consumer groups, small and widely affordable units of sale,
prepackaged goods with fixed prices, convenient retail outlets.
One research team describes the mechanics of a typical open-air
drug market transaction: </p>

<p> A car drives down a residential street with enormous
apartment buildings on either side. Young men wave to the car; a
few of the more aggressive dealers step into traffic to signal
autos to stop. Even before the wheels have stopped rolling,
several young men are at the window; &quot;You looking?&quot;
says one. &quot;Smoke, smoke. I've got crack. Whatever you
want&quot; says the other peering over his shoulder. The answer
from the driver is simple and short: &quot;Two dimes.&quot; Two
small brown glass vials are exchanged for a 20 dollar bill and
the transaction is over in a matter of seconds (3). </p>

<p> Although the exact method for conducting a transaction may
vary slightly from place to place around the country, the essence
of the transaction is remarkably similar across the United
States. Flagrant or open-air drug markets have many of the same
structural characteristics as legal marketplaces: demographic and
product segmentation, brand loyalty, cartel pricing, aggressive
salesmen working on commission, and careful recruitment of loyal
and productive employees (3). </p>

<p> Alcohol and Tobacco </p>

<p> The marketing of legal yet addictive substances, especially
tobacco and alcohol, has become controversial in recent years.
Issues stemming from the marketing of licit substances include
advertising, taxation, and labeling. </p>

<p> Advertising </p>

<p> Alcohol and tobacco products have long been advertised in the
United States. In the 1950s and 1960s, these products were
advertised with minimal restrictions. Following the Surgeon
General's report on the hazards of smoking in 1964 (13), public
sentiment against cigarette advertising increased. The most
famous example of Federal regulation is the ban on broadcast
cigarette advertising in January 1971 resulting from the passage
by Congress of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969
(Public Law 91-222). In recent years, attention has focused on
legislative proposals to ban all forms of cigarette advertising,
and to control the advertising of alcoholic products. </p>

<p> Taxation </p>

<p> The federal government currently levies excise taxes on
alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. Excise taxes on all
types of alcoholic beverages were raised in 1990 to their current
levels. Currently, for example, beer (six pack 12-ounce cans)
carries a 33 cent federal excise tax, a 750 ml bottle of wine
carries a 21 cent federal excise tax. A pack of cigarettes
carries a federal excise tax of 24 cents. </p>

<p> A number of studies in the 1980s focused on the impact of
federal excise taxes on cigarette consumption. A 1986 study
concluded that an 8- to 16-cent increase in the federal cigarette
excise tax would encourage from 1 to 2 million young persons and
8,000 to 1.5 million adults to quit smoking or not to start.
Thus, a tax increase could prevent hundreds of thousands of
premature smoking-related deaths, while a tax decrease would
contribute to the disease burden of tobacco (14). The General
Accounting Office, in a review of the literature on teenage
smoking and excise taxes, concluded that an increase in the
cigarette excise tax would be an effective way to reduce teenage
smoking (12). </p>

<p> Labeling </p>

<p> Federal law addresses the labeling of both cigarettes and
alcoholic beverages. In both cases, Congress declared that the
purpose of such labeling is to make sure the American public is
informed about the potential health hazards that may result from
consumption (36 USC 1331; 27 USC 213). Manufacturers of
cigarettes must use one of four rotating warnings on each
package, while manufacturers of alcoholic beverages must post a
prescribed warning (see box 4-5). Proponents of labeling have
stated that such warnings do not create legal restrictions, but
only help to inform the consumer about possible health risks.
Opponents of labeling have argued that no scientific proof exists
to link labeling with reduced use or improved health. </p>

<p> SUMMARY </p>

<p> The second set of preconditions for drug abuse and dependency
includes availability and marketing. A person cannot become a
drug abuser unless a drug is physically available to be used. In
addition, however, availability is affected by social norms
(e.g., factors within the community conducive to drug use,
including level of parental or guardian supervision, lack of
consequences for alcohol and drug offenses, lack of alternative
activities, portrayals of alcohol and other drug use by friends
and the media as a glamorous and healthy activity), prices
(economic availability), and personal values (subjective
availability). </p>

<p> The primary focus of U.S. antidrug policy has been to attack
the physical availability of illicit drugs through law
enforcement efforts aimed at disrupting the production,
transport, and sale of drugs. While this focus has increased
drug-related arrests--nearly half of newly sentenced federal
inmates in 1991 were imprisoned on drug charges--illicit drugs
are still widely available. </p>

<p> Marketing techniques for both licit and illicit drugs can
alter social, economic, and subjective availability. Key
components of marketing include the promotion and advertising of
particular product lines to appeal to particular subpopulations
of the consuming public; development of a product line that can
be targeted to subpopulations within the larger community of
consumers; pricing strategies to attract new buyers; and
identification of retail outlets for sales. </p>

<p> Federal law regulates the merchandising of licit yet abusable
substances such as tobacco, alcohol, and prescription drugs by
placing a variety of restrictions on how such products may be
marketed. Despite current restrictions, debate continues as to
whether and how a variety of legal drugs should be marketed.<br>
</p>

<p> BOX 4-1: What Is Marketing? </p>

<p> Marketing includes any activity involved in moving goods from
producer to consumer. In the context of drugs, marketing includes
a variety of activities covering a wide range of licit and
illicit substances. </p>

<p> For licit substances, such as alcohol, tobacco, and
inhalants, it includes market research, advertising, pricing, and
taxation. A number of government policies in the marketing
arena--taxes, advertising restrictions, point- of-sale controls,
and age restrictions on certain products-- directly affects the
availability of licit, yet abusable, substances. </p>

<p> For illicit drugs, such as marijuana, cocaine, and
hallucinogens, marketing techniques can include street markets,
gang activity, and private, closely controlled distribution and
sales systems. Government control in this area--prohibiting the
possession, use, and sale of such substances--likewise affects
the availability of these substances. </p>

<p> Box 4-2: Availability and Tobacco </p>

<p> The evolution of tobacco from a relatively rare product
requiring preparation, thought, and ritual to a product that is
ubiquitous, prepackaged, and consumed without much fanfare
provides a graphic illustration of how increased physical
availability of a product can dramatically increase drug use,
abuse, and addiction. Three major developments in the history of
tobacco use paved the way for making this drug imminently
available for use by consumers: the invention of the cigarette
manufacturing machine, the invention and perfection of matches,
and the proliferation of the use of vending machines to sell
tobacco products. </p>

<p> The first successful cigarette manufacturing machine was
developed in 1881 by James A. Bonsack. This machine had the
capacity to produce more than 200 cigarettes per minute. Prior to
the advent of this machine, smokers had to roll each cigarette by
hand, a time-consuming and often ritualistic process. </p>

<p> Once rolled, a cigarette must be lit to be consumed. This was
no easy task prior to the introduction of the safety match, first
invented in 1896 but not perfected until 1912. Without matches,
smokers were required to enter cigar stores to light cigarettes
from gas or oil lamps provided specifically for the purpose of
lighting tobacco products. These developments changed forever the
way that cigarettes were consumed by making them readily
available for consumption at any moment during the day. Instead
of a thoughtful, often ritualistic exercise, cigarette
consumption has evolved for some into an almost unconscious
habit. Following the invention of the manufacturing machine and
the safety match, the rate of cigarette consumption soared during
the late 19th and early 20th century. </p>

<p> The use of vending machines may be the most revolutionary
aspect of tobacco availability. First introduced in 1926, vending
machines require no sales person, are not restricted by selected
hours of operation, and are not concerned with the age or
legality of the purchaser. Vending machines make cigarettes
available almost anywhere, appearing in bars, hotels, train and
bus stations, airports, hotels, and restaurants. By 1953, nearly
half a million cigarette machines existed and were responsible
for sales of more than 3 billion packs of cigarettes a year. The
upward trend in sales from cigarette machines continued through
the mid- 1970s: by 1973 more than 900,000 vending machines were
in operation, selling almost 5 billion packs per year. Some early
research indicated that the existence of vending machines
throughout the physical environment is a major inducement to
impulse smoking. </p>

<p> BOX 4-3: Survey Comments, Economic Availability </p>

<p> Economic factors impact on perceptions of availability in a
number of ways. For example, because Sioux Falls, South Dakota,
was experiencing a &quot;strong economy . . . juveniles have had
an abundance of cash available for alcohol/drug usage.&quot; More
frequent, however, were comments stating the opinion that a poor
economy increased the economic availability of drugs and alcohol:
</p>

<p> Frankfort, Kentucky: &quot;Profit motive due to national
economy and lack of job training/jobs. Lack of hope and
opportunity for some causes increased sale of drugs due to high
profit.&quot; </p>

<p> Barbourville, Kentucky: &quot;Drug dealers that cannot make
it flipping hamburgers, but are successful at selling drugs and
have a lot of material evidence of their success. Law enforcement
needs to confiscate these material items in prosecution of case.
Also, involvement of drug dealing by law enforcement and
politicians is a problem. &quot; </p>

<p> Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: &quot;Teenaged drug dealers have
status, money, jewelry, cars, designer clothes, etc., which many
of their peers cannot afford.&quot; </p>

<p> Fort Worth, Texas: &quot;Depressed economic conditions--Lack
of legitimate means to obtain income. It's easy money with
minimal consequences for conviction.&quot; </p>

</p>

<p> BOX 4-4: Survey Comments, Social Availability </p>

<p> Conway, New Hampshire: &quot;Our law enforcers are known and
make little inroads towards prosecuting drug traffickers or
sellers. Many young adults supply liquor and drugs to underage
kids in our area.&quot; </p>

<p> Mount Holly, New Jersey: &quot;The legal system does not
fairly prosecute offenders. It gives some juveniles the message
that depending upon your circumstances it is OK to use and sell
drugs.&quot; </p>

<p> Muskogee, Oklahoma: &quot;The lack of prosecutive vigor in
alcohol-related offenses (Minor in possession, public
intoxication, D.U.I.). District attorney does not vigorously
pursue and law enforcement treats D.U.I. as public
intoxication.&quot; </p>

<p> Prineville, Oregon: &quot;This community is basically a blue
collar community. There is an attitude of acceptance of juveniles
using alcohol. Kind of a boys will be boys attitude.&quot; </p>

<p> South Bend, Indiana: &quot;We have seen an increase in
alcohol consumption that appears to be tolerated or even
encouraged by adults (primarily parents).&quot; </p>

<p> Hillsboro, Illinois: &quot;Lack of education, interest,
cooperation of parents. Not enough interest with higher officials
(e.g., school teachers, church members, government officials,
businesses, and senior citizens).&quot; </p>

<p> Baraboo, Michigan: &quot;Lack of appropriate teen activities.
Lack of parental interest.&quot; </p>

<p> Jacksonville, Illinois: &quot;Decrease in the ability and
willingness of individual family units to educate, instruct, and
monitor juvenile behaviors.&quot; </p>

<p> Nicholasville, Kentucky: &quot;Alcohol is supplied willingly
to juveniles by a large number of adults. Inhalants are available
at any department store.&quot; </p>

<p> Brownstown, Indiana: &quot;Children, mostly high school age,
come in contact with adults, ages 18-23, who are very willing to
buy alcohol or sell drugs to their younger friends. In addition,
these children who do not have money on hand are likely to steal
items and trade them for drugs or cash to buy alcohol and
drugs.&quot; </p>

<p> BOX 4-5: Cigarette and Alcoholic Beverage Warnings </p>

<p> It is unlawful for any person to manufacture, package, or
import for sale or distribution within the United States any
cigarettes the package of which fails to bear one of the
following labels: </p>

<p> SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart
Disease, Emphysema, And May Complicate Pregnancy. </p>

<p> SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: Quitting Smoking Now Greatly
Reduces Serious Risks to Your Health. </p>

<p> SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: Smoking By Pregnant Women May
Result in Fetal Injury, Premature Birth, And Low Birth Weight. </p>

<p> SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon
Monoxide. </p>

<p> It is unlawful for any person to manufacture, import, or
bottle for sale or distribution in the United States any
alcoholic beverage unless the container of such beverage bears
the following statement: </p>

<p> GOVERNMENT WARNING: (1) According to the Surgeon General,
women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy
because of the risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of
alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or
operate machinery, and may cause health problems. </p>

<p> <b>TECHNOLOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE
ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> <b>US Government Office of Technology Assessment</b> </p>

<p> October 18, 1994 </p>

<p> <b>CHAPTER 6 INDIVIDUAL RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS </b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"> </p>

<p> No single or generic set of variables explains the misuse of
substances for every individual. Depending on an individual's
biological makeup, developmental stage, and interaction with
various environmental forces, individual risk, vulnerability, and
resilience to substance abuse and addiction will vary for
different factors at different times (3). </p>

<p> Much of the research on substance abuse has focused on
identifying factors for drug and alcohol use (see table 6- 1),
specifically among adolescents and young adults. Risk factors for
substance abuse have been identified as those cognitive,
psychological, attitudinal, social, pharmacological,
physiological, and developmental characteristics that foster
initiation of drug and alcohol use and abuse by an individual.
There is some consensus in the field of risk factor research that
probably two fairly distinct sets of risk factors affect
individuals differently. Social, situational, and environmental
factors are likely to be more influential in initial or low-level
substance use, while individuals who progress from use to abuse
or addiction are influenced to a greater extent by biological,
psychological, and psychiatric factors (27). This distinction
between risk factors is more thoroughly discussed in chapter 5.
Protective factors are those characteristics that reduce the risk
of substance abuse and addiction and promote positive development
such as, appropriate role models, involvement in positive peer
groups, and a positive self-image and outlook for the future. </p>

<p> This chapter focuses on a select group of individual factors
that has been combined under the three headings: Demographics, </p>

<p> Economics, and Psychosocial/Behavioral. Factors not directly
discussed in this chapter are reviewed in either Part I or III of
the report. These factors may not appear in every individual with
substance abuse and addiction problems, nor will all individuals
exposed to these factors use or abuse drugs. In addition,
unanimous agreement is lacking within the field of substance
abuse and addiction on the importance, number, order of
appearance, or interactive effects of many of these factors. </p>

<p> Where applicable, each of the factors has been reviewed in
the following manner: historical perspectives; current
prevalence; psychosocial and cultural antecedents; biological and
genetic antecedents; relevant prevention programs; and areas for
future research. </p>

<p> DEMOGRAPHICS </p>

<p> Age </p>

<p> The preponderance of substance abuse research points to the
fact that children who use drugs and alcohol before the age of 15
have a greater likelihood of becoming problem alcohol and other
drug users, versus those youth who begin use at a later age (28).
</p>

<p> Highlights from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse
(NHSDA) provide a somber picture of substance use among the
Nation's children (77). Lifetime and past month substance use,
rates for continued substance use, as well as differences in
racial and ethnic substance use (see box 6-1) are reviewed in
this section. </p>

<p> As part of NHSDA, data on lifetime use of alcohol and
cigarettes (whose use is illicit for minors) has been collected
for youth aged 12 to 17 since 1974; data collection on other
illicit drug use began in 1979 (see figure 6-1). The lifetime use
findings include: </p>

<p> o Rates in 1991 for lifetime use of alcohol, cigarettes, or
other illicit drugs were the lowest recorded since the survey
series began 17 years ago. The highest rates for any substance
use appeared in the late 1970s. </p>

<p> o In 1979, 70 percent of youth aged 12 to 17 reported some
lifetime use of alcohol compared to 46 percent in 1991. Since
1979, lifetime cigarette use has dropped from 54 percent to 38
percent. </p>

<p> o Since 1979, the use of other illicit substances
(methaqualone, inhalants, heroin, cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP),
crack, tranquilizers, stimulants, other opiates, barbiturates,
nitrites, lysergic acid diethylamide, hallucinogens, and
marijuana) has followed a similar trend with rates decreasing
from a high of 34 percent to the 1991 rate of 20 percent. </p>

<p> A complementary study of adolescents shows 1991 data for
substance use within the past 30 days among a sample of
approximately 17,500 eighth graders, 14,800 tenth graders, and
15,000 twelfth graders (75). </p>

<p> o Any alcohol use within the past 30 days was reported by 25
percent of the eighth graders, 43 percent of the tenth graders,
and 54 percent of the twelfth graders. Having had more than five
drinks in the last two weeks was reported by 13 percent of the
eighth graders, 23 percent of the tenth graders, and 30 percent
of the twelfth graders. </p>

<p> o Fourteen percent of the eighth graders, 21 percent of the
tenth graders, and 28 percent of the twelfth graders reported
smoking cigarettes within the past month. Those who smoked more
than one-half pack per day included 3 percent of the eighth
graders, 7 percent of the tenth graders, and 11 percent of the
twelfth graders. </p>

<p> o The other most commonly used substance for eighth and tenth
graders was smokeless tobacco with 7 and 10 percent reported,
respectively. Eighth graders had the highest percentage of past
month inhalant use (4 percent), and of those individuals,
approximately 1 percent reported using inhalants on 3 to 5
occasions within the past month. </p>

<p> o For tenth and twelfth graders, the other most commonly used
substance was marijuana and/or hashish with 9 percent of the
tenth graders and 14 percent of the twelfth graders reporting
past 30-day use. Of those individuals, approximately 2 and 3
percent, respectively, had used marijuana and/or hashish on three
to five occasions. </p>

<p> Another important indicator of potential substance abuse
problems among adolescents is the noncontinuation rate for the
use of certain substances. This is an indication of the extent to
which people who try a drug do not continue to use it, and is
based on the number of individuals who reported ever using a drug
divided by the those who have not used the drug in the past 12
months (75). </p>

<p> Among a sample of twelfth graders in 1991, the data show that
noncontinuation rates vary widely among the different drugs, with
the highest rates observed for methaqualone and inhalants (62
percent). As mentioned previously, inhalant use is higher among
younger individuals. The noncontinuation of methaqualone may be
due, in part, to the decrease in its availability. A high
noncontinuation rate is also seen for heroin (56 percent),
cocaine (55 percent), PCP (52 percent), and crack (52 percent).
Marijuana has one of the lowest noncontinuation rates (35
percent) in the senior year of any of the illicit drugs;
primarily because a relatively high proportion of seniors
continue to use it at some level over an extended period of time.
</p>

<p> Additionally, the noncontinuation rates for alcohol and
cigarettes are extremely low. In other words, 88 percent of the
seniors reported some lifetime use of alcohol, and of those
individuals, 78 percent have continued to use it within the past
year, thus only 12 percent of the seniors reported no alcohol use
in the preceding 12 months. Cigarette noncontinuation was defined
somewhat differently, as the percentage of those who said they
had ever smoked &quot;regularly&quot; and who also reported not
smoking at all during the past month. Of the regular smokers,
only 17 percent stopped smoking within the past month. </p>

<p> An obvious drawback to these data is the fact that only those
individuals who have not dropped out of school are included in
the survey. It is not unrealistic to assume that those students
with serious drug problems may well have left school before the
twelfth grade. More specific discussion of the factors that
influence the risk of adolescent substance abuse, as well as
prevention programs targeting youth, are thoroughly reviewed in
chapter 8. </p>

<p> While the majority of attention is focused on adolescent
substance use and abuse, young adults and older adults also show
significant levels of substance use and abuse. The 1991
statistics from the NHSDA reveal that heavy drinking (defined as
drinking five or more drinks per occasion on 5 or more days in
the past month) was reported by 2 percent of 12 to 17 year olds,
11 percent of 18 to 25 year olds, 7 percent of 26 to 34 year
olds, and 4 percent of those 35 and older (77). For those same
age categories, smoking a pack or more of cigarettes per day was
reported by 1, 13, 17, and 17 percent, respectively. The illicit
substances reported being used most often in the past month among
all age groups were marijuana and hashish. Individuals 18 to 25
had the highest percentage (13 percent) and those 26 to 34 the
next highest percentage (7 percent). The second most commonly
reported illicit substance was the nonmedical use of
psychotherapeutics, which was again highest among 18 to 25 year
olds (3 percent) followed by those 26 to 34 (2 percent); all
other age groups reported less than 2 percent. </p>

<p> Clearly then, the heavy use of some substances is not
exclusive to adolescents. Young- to middle-aged and older adults
can also be exposed to stressful risk factors, such as loss of a
job, divorce, or death of a child, which could contribute to
alcohol or drug problems. The adult population presents unique
and often overlooked challenges for the planning and
implementation of substance abuse prevention programs. </p>

<p> Gender </p>

<p> Historically, the vast majority of biological and behavioral
substance abuse studies were conducted on male participants,
although that has begun to change. A distorted picture emerged,
in which women were assumed to misuse the same substances, and
for the same reasons, as their male counterparts. It has only
been within the past 10 to 20 years that separate research has
been conducted on the causes and consequences of alcohol and drug
problems among women. </p>

<p> Women have not been immune to the harmful effects of alcohol
and other drugs. In the late 1800s twice as many women were
addicted to narcotics as men. The majority of these women were
white, middle-aged, and of upper-middle class status. Some had
become addicted through the prescription of narcotics for a host
of so-called female problems, while others knowingly misused
opium, heroin, morphine, and cocaine (53). </p>

<p> The number of women drinking alcohol and experiencing
alcohol-related problems has risen steadily since World War II.
At least one-third of the estimated 18 million alcoholics and
problem drinkers in the United States are thought to be women.
These figures, which many consider to be conservative, would
suggest that close to 6 million women are currently dealing with
the medical, legal, and social problems of alcohol misuse (53). </p>

<p> Overall, men report more frequent use of alcohol, cigarettes,
and all illicit substances (except nonmedical use of
psychotherapeutics) than women (79,77). However, this does not
mean that there is not substantial alcohol and drug use among
women (see table 6-2). Additionally, some gender and ethnic
differences may be attributable to failure to survey hidden
populations. The risk status of women who are not in the
workforce, do not receive prenatal care, and are not visible
through arrest, is less reliably known. </p>

<p> Neither men, nor women, should be considered homogeneous. For
example, alcohol use and its misuse can vary widely between
different racial and ethnic groups. Among men, Hispanics (60
percent) were slightly more likely to have used alcohol within
the past month than whites (59 percent) or blacks (52 percent)
(77). In general, white women drink more frequently than other
women. Large numbers of Native American, Hispanic, black, and
Asian women do not drink at all (70). Additionally, poor and
minority women appear to come under closer scrutiny for alcohol
and drug abuse than do financially secure or white women (see box
6-2). These racial and ethnic differences are more fully
discussed in the following section. </p>

<p> Do men and women cite different reasons for the misuse of
alcohol and other drugs? Over the last several decades within the
United States, the socially defined roles for men and women have
undergone substantial changes. When given a choice, many women
have opted for the traditional role of a stay-at-home mother and
homemaker, while other women have pursued career paths that may
or may not include marriage and children, and still others have
attempted to combine the two. These fairly recent changes have
brought pressures and risks many women had not been subjected to
previously. </p>

<p> Women in the workplace are more likely to encounter drinking
opportunities such as business lunches and office celebrations,
where they may feel encouraged or even pressured to drink (53).
Women have also been recently targeted by the beer, tobacco, and
liquor industries, as well as by small-scale marketing by
nightclubs and bars in the form of ladies' nights. </p>

<p> In the early 1970s, researcher Sharon Wilsnack postulated
that some women may abuse alcohol to submerge those aspects of
themselves that did not conform to the traditional female sex
role, thereby allowing them to feel more acceptably feminine
(53). More recently, several studies on female alcoholics have
shown that women, more frequently than men, can pinpoint a
specific traumatic life event that they believe precipitated
their problem drinking. The crises identified most often by women
included a partner's infidelity, the death of a family member, a
child leaving home, postpartum depression, divorce or separation,
infertility, gynecological problems, and menopause (39,53). </p>

<p> A similar study focused on the impact of various life events
on alcoholic men and women. Alcoholic men placed significant
importance on work-related events, marriage issues, sexual
difficulties, and arguments with spouses. In addition to those
events cited by the men, alcoholic women focused on social
activities, family troubles, stillbirth and adoption, and death
of a close relative (40). </p>

<p> While much of the substance abuse research has focused on
alcohol issues, various researchers have examined the differences
between men and women in their use of illicit substances with or
without the presence of alcohol. For men and women cocaine
addicts in treatment, the following significant differences were
noted (40,41,35): </p>

<p> o Women had started to use cocaine at a younger age than men,
conversely to what is generally found among opiate users and
alcoholics. </p>

<p> o Women had a significantly lower level of social adjustment
than male patients. </p>

<p> o Women patients were less likely to be employed, to hold
high status jobs, to be self-supporting, and to be financing
their own drug use. </p>

<p> o Women were more likely than men to cite specific reasons
for their drug use: depression, feeling unsociable, family and
job pressures, and health problems; whereas men more often cited
the intoxicating effects of cocaine as a reason for their drug
use. </p>

<p> o Men reported experiencing more guilt (47 vs. 23 percent),
whereas women noted that one of the desirable effects of cocaine
use was a reduction in their feelings of guilt. </p>

<p> o Women were more often diagnosed with depression than men,
and their depression took longer to treat, while men were more
often diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. </p>

<p> o Most men and women reported that they used cocaine to be
more sociable. </p>

<p> o Women demonstrated a slower recovery than men, and had more
residual problems. </p>

<p> Gender differences among opiate addicts have also been
explored. Researchers have shown that female addicts are more
likely than male addicts to have first been introduced to heroin
by family members or others close to them, and to have
experienced severe family disruption (36). The development of the
women's opiate dependence is also more likely to be linked to the
family's approval of use or the absence of clear disapproval of
use, in combination with easy access to the drug (35). </p>

<p> Differences in marijuana smoking may also be partially
attributable to gender. In a recent review, it was shown that
men's marijuana smoking was tied more to the availability of the
drug, while women's smoking was affected to a greater degree by
social influences, such as weekday versus weekend smoking, and
the smoking of their male partners. Women have also been shown to
increase their marijuana smoking during periods of anger and
other unpleasant dispositions (41). </p>

<p> In addition to discovering some sociocultural
dissimilarities, gender differences in biological and genetic
susceptibility to substance abuse have been examined. The role of
heritability and genetics in influencing individual
susceptibility is more thoroughly discussed in chapter 3, thus
the discussion in this section will concentrate on biological
differences. Again, a large portion of these studies has
concentrated on alcohol and its effects. </p>

<p> In the late 1970s it was reported that when men and women of
comparable body weight were given equivalent doses of alcohol,
women achieved higher blood alcohol levels. However, these
findings have been challenged, as more recent studies have shown
that if the blood alcohol level is based on total body water
rather than weight, the difference in levels between men and
women is insignificant (65). </p>

<p> Another avenue that has been explored in explaining the
gender difference in blood alcohol levels has to do with the
metabolism of alcohol. Based on findings from animal research,
Mario Frezza et al. (25) investigated differences in the
&quot;first-pass metabolism&quot; between men and women. Data
from animal studies reveal that a significant amount of ingested
ethanol does not enter the circulatory system, but rather is
neutralized in the stomach by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase.
Using a small study sample (6 alcoholic and 14 nonalcoholic men,
6 alcoholic and 17 nonalcoholic women) Frezza et al. investigated
whether the first-pass metabolism and enzyme activity level
varied between men and women, and alcoholic and nonalcoholic
individuals. They discovered that both gender and chronic alcohol
abuse had statistically significant effects on the first-pass
metabolism of alcohol, specifically, the first-pass metabolism
was considerably lower among alcoholic women compared to
alcoholic men, which in turn was lower than nonalcoholic men.
Similar findings were reported for the alcohol dehydrogenase
activity level; with the highest activity levels (70 to 80
percent) found in the nonalcoholic men and women, less activity
among the alcoholic men (37 to 46 percent), and the smallest
activity level among alcoholic women (11 to 20 percent). To
summarize, the women in general had lower rates of first- pass
metabolism and lower levels of alcohol dehydrogenase activity,
which both lead to an increase in the amount of ethanol in the
circulatory system. The levels of enzyme activity further
decreased among the alcoholic women and the first-pass metabolism
was essentially nonexistent, indicating little neutralization by
the stomach. </p>

<p> Researchers have also been studying the effect of hormonal
changes during the menstrual cycle on alcohol absorption rates.
Alcohol absorption has been reported to vary during a woman's
cycle--specifically, the rate of alcohol absorption increases
premenstrually. However, data from other clinicaland animal
trials have disputed these findings (65). </p>

<p> What is clear from this type of biological research is that
few firm conclusions can be made about gender differences in
response to alcohol ingestion, and even fewer still about
biological responses to drugs other than alcohol. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, the psychosocial differences that have been
identified between the sexes could assist practitioners in the
development of more gender specific substance abuse prevention
programs. For example, because many women can pinpoint specific
events in their lives that they believe contributed to their
heavy alcohol or drug use, it would behoove professionals working
with women to be cognizant of these factors. General inquires
could be made at yearly physical or gynecological exams, which
could also serve as informational sessions on the dangers of
alcohol and drug use (39). In addition, special attention should
be paid toward adolescent girls whose first experience with
alcohol and drugs is often through a male family member or
boyfriend. </p>

<p> Broadly speaking, there are basic gaps in knowledge
concerning gender differences and substance use within virtually
all the parts identified in this report: Part I- necessary
preconditions; Part II-individual factors; and Part III-activity
settings. Until these gaps are addressed, the practice of
transferring data garnered from studies specific for one gender,
to the other gender, is inaccurate and misleading. </p>

<p> Race and Ethnicity </p>

<p> Historically, racial and ethnic minorities have been linked
with, and often blamed for, many of the drug problems within the
United States. Throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s, the
general public associated the growth in opium addicts with the
arrival of Chinese immigrants; although numerous physicians had
been freely prescribing narcotic preparations to their patients,
many of whom were middle- to upper-class whites. The drug cocaine
has long been associated with blacks. A popular image during this
time was one of cocaine-crazed blacks, although use of cocaine
was widespread among whites as well (86). Throughout this same
period, marijuana was thought to have been brought into the
country and promoted by Mexican immigrants and later picked up by
the subculture of black jazz musicians. Due in part to public
paranoia, the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, which was a direct
attempt to control marijuana use, was born (45). </p>

<p> In the minds of many individuals, this derogatory link
between minority populations and rampant drug abuse has
continued. Certainly, many urban areas have high concentrations
of minorities, and within these areas the prevalence of alcohol
and drug abuse may be high. Often over-looked, however, is the
existence of alcohol and drug problems in suburban and rural
areas throughout the United States, which have varying
percentages of minorities. </p>

<p> Prevalence rates for past month use of an illicit substance
in 1992 (see figure 6-2) are not drastically different between
whites, blacks, and Hispanics, although it should be kept in mind
that this statistic does not accurately reflect abuse or
addiction. Even though the prevalence of illicit substance use
was highest among blacks, over three-fourths (76 percent) of the
past month illicit substance users were white. In other words,
there were approximately 8.7 million whites, 1.5 million blacks,
885,000 Hispanics, and 315,000 individuals of other racial and
ethnic groups who reported past month use of an illicit substance
in 1992 (79). </p>

<p> Also for 1992 among individuals aged 12 and older, whites
reported the highest percentage of alcohol use within the past
week (21 percent), followed by blacks (19 percent), and Hispanics
(18 percent) (79). The rates for heavy drinking were not
statistically different by race or ethnicity (5 percent for
whites and blacks, and 6 percent for Hispanics) (78). </p>

<p> Until fairly recently, much of the analysis of substance use
data has concentrated on the correlations between the use of a
substance and one or two variables such as race and ethnicity
and/or educational level. Often a positive association was found
between minority populations and the use of certain substances.
While statistically correct, these analyses can be simplistic and
misleading (see box 6- 3). Clearly many risk and protective
factors interact to produce substance use and abuse. If the
majority of these variables are excluded from the analysis, a
skewed picture may arise as to the importance of certain
variables as risk factors for substance use and abuse.
Additionally, to simplify the data collection, racial and ethnic
categories are often broad. The most popular groupings are
blacks, white non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and other. Though each of
these categories contains many distinct cultures, gross
generalizations are commonly made within each category. </p>

<p> In recent years, there has been a shift toward analyzing more
carefully the complex relationship between cigarette, alcohol and
illicit drug use, and socioeconomic and demographic variables.
The previous research had drawn on relatively small databases.
However, in 1992, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)
critically analyzed the national drug use data collected in its
1988 and 1990 NHSDA. Predictors of drug and alcohol use included
an extensive array of both individual variables (e.g., age,
educational level, marital status) and aggregate variables based
on the attributes of the census block, community, or region in
which the respondent lived (see table 6-3 for a complete list). </p>

<p> The effect of select variables such as race and ethnicity
were measured, while simultaneously controlling for all other
variables (e.g., age, educational level, employment status).
Individuals of racial and ethnic minorities were found to be no
more likely than whites to use alcohol heavily (defined as having
five or more drinks on five or more days in the past month) or to
use marijuana, cocaine, or psychotherapeutic drugs (inclusion of
crack or heroin in the analysis was impossible due to the small
number of respondents reporting use). In fact, when socioeconomic
status was controlled for, both blacks and Hispanics had a
substantially lower likelihood of heavy alcohol use than whites
(76). </p>

<p> A reanalysis of the 1988 NHSDA data was accomplished by an
independent group of researchers who clustered the respondent
data into neighborhood risk sets. The original analysis on the
1988 data revealed that for all ages, blacks and Hispanics were
twice as likely to have ever used crack cocaine than were whites.
Once neighborhood clusters were established, the data revealed
that given similar social and environmental conditions, crack use
did not differ significantly for blacks or Hispanics compared
with whites (9). However, the number of reported crack users in
the study was relatively small (138), and neighborhoods were
identified as crack neighborhoods with as few as one reported
crack user, thus the research findings should not be generalized.
</p>

<p> The new research hypothesized that the previous racial
differences found in the prevalence of crack cocaine smoking may
have been due to macrosocial environmental risk factors
including: differences in the availability of crack; employment
rates; premature death rates; community contact with the criminal
justice system; socially acceptable mechanisms for coping with
life stressors; distribution of wealth; and access to social
resources. </p>

<p> While both studies had specific limitations, the importance
of these types of analyses cannot be understated. Focus should be
placed on the interaction between communities and individuals and
the relative influence on subsequent drug and alcohol use, rather
than a person's race or ethnicity. </p>

<p> Race or ethnicity has not been shown to be either a
biological or genetic risk factor for substance use or abuse. To
date, the preponderance of investigative studies has focused on
racial and ethnic differences in response specifically to
alcohol. Virtually no study has been completed on differences in
racial and ethnic biological responses to other licit or illicit
drugs. </p>

<p> Individual metabolism of alcohol is essentially controlled by
two enzymes, aldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase. If
the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase is inactive for any reason,
ingestion of even a small amount of alcohol can cause rapid and
prominent facial flushing. Continued drinking leads to nausea,
dizziness, palpitations, and faintness. This reaction is seen
among many Asians (84,16). </p>

<p> A mutant form of alcohol dehydrogenase will effect the
efficiency of alcohol metabolism as well. Altered forms of the
alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme have also been reported in several
Asian populations. </p>

<p> The two enzymes, aldehyde and alcohol dehydrogenase, probably
interact in some individuals to amplify the adverse reaction to
alcohol consumption (57). Since this reaction discourages heavy
drinking, the observation that it commonly occurs in some
populations where alcoholism is relatively rare suggests that
alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase mutations might be a major
determinant of alcohol consumption, abuse, and dependence. This
would seem to hold true for Taiwan and Japan where the reaction
occurs in 30 to 50 percent of individuals. Research on these two
enzymes among other racial and ethnic groups is scanty and
inconclusive. </p>

<p> The role genetics plays in the heritability of alcohol and
other drug problems has been studied for the past 30 years. While
this topic is more thoroughly addressed in chapter 3, one point
is worth mentioning here. Of the more than 30 family, twin, and
adoption studies that have been completed, the vast majority have
used white males as study subjects. Clearly, among different
racial and ethnic groups the relationship between genetic
heritability and increased susceptibility to alcohol and other
drug problems is an area that deserves further study. </p>

<p> While race and ethnicity in and of themselves are not
predictive risk factors for future substance abuse, by reviewing
when, how, and why certain substances became problematic within
different racial and ethnic groups, insight can be gained into
the generational impact drugs have had on these populations. Four
broad racial and ethnic groups (and one multiracial and ethnic
group, see box 6-4) are discussed below in the following manner:
historical perspectives; prevalence statistics; psychosocial and
cultural antecedents; and selected prevention programs. A
separate section on areas for future research is also included. </p>

<p> Native American Indians/Alaska Natives </p>

<p> There are more than 1.5 million Americans Indians and Alaskan
Natives throughout the United States, with vastly different
languages and cultural beliefs. Even within the same tribe there
may be a good deal of cultural diversity, since differences exist
between reservation and rural tribal members, and those residing
in urban settings. While urban dwelling American Indians may
constitute more than 50 percent of the total Indian population,
little is known concerning their health status (59). </p>

<p> The American Indians' introduction to alcohol dates back to
the early 1600s and their initial interactions with European
trappers and settlers. Much of the early trading between the
Europeans and American Indians involved an exchange of alcohol.
It was not long before alcohol became a considerable problem for
many American Indian tribes. Some researchers speculate that
because American Indians lacked a prior drinking history, or role
model for moderate drinking practices, many tribes adopted a
quick and copious style of drinking, consistently drinking to the
point of intoxication. However, in other tribes, it is appears
that being intoxicated was deemed unacceptable, and over time
these tribes developed a &quot;social&quot; drinking style (35). </p>

<p> Prevalence statistics </p>

<p> Studies among American Indian adolescents have shown that
prevalence rates for licit and illicit drug use vary
insignificantly between tribes (5,4). However, compared to
non-Indian youth, Indian adolescents consistently begin using
alcohol, illicit substances, cigarettes, and inhalants at a
younger age, at higher rates, and in combination with each other
(10,60,69). With regard to alcohol, there is often a great deal
of peer pressure to drink as the Indian thing to do (42). Studies
have shown that Indian youth are three times more likely to be
involved in alcohol-related offenses than their white or Hispanic
counterparts. A 1982 study indicated that alcohol was involved in
as many as 58 percent of Indian juvenile arrests (63 percent for
males, 37 percent for females)(60). </p>

<p> In some tribes, up to 30 percent of American Indian
adolescents have used inhalants, most notably, gasoline and glue.
The age group with the highest rate of inhalant use was 11- to
13-year-olds. Contrary to the popular belief that inhalant abuse
occurs primarily among boys, research among American Indians
revealed that eighth grade girls and boys were equally likely to
have inhaled volatile substances. While the rate for Indian
inhalant use decreases substantially among high school age youth
(down to 4 percent), it is still 2.5 times greater than the rate
for non-Indian youth of that age. Interestingly, while the rate
of inhalant use has remained relatively stable among Indian youth
since 1984, there has been a steady rise of reported use among
non-Indian adolescents (66). </p>

<p> While there is no substantial difference in alcohol use among
various tribal adolescents, rates do differ between the drinking
patterns of tribal adults. Contrary to the still pervasive
drunken Indian stereotype, many tribes have levels of adult
alcohol use below the national average (42). Consistent with the
U.S. population as a whole, American Indian males are more likely
to drink than females (42,35). In some tribes it is permissible
for adolescent females to experiment with alcohol, with the
understanding that when adulthood is reached they are expected to
abstain or drink only rarely. </p>

<p> As is true for adolescents, adult Indians encounter an
increased rate of legal complications due to alcohol and drug
use. Data on urban American Indians has shown that while under
the influence of alcohol and/or other drugs, they are arrested at
four times the rate for blacks and 10 times the rate for whites
(44). </p>

<p> Few statistics exist to quantify illicit substance use among
the adult American Indian population. While alcohol is clearly a
major problem for some tribes, future research efforts should
include data on the use of illicit substances. </p>

<p> Psychosocial/cultural antecedents </p>

<p> The relationship between the majority of American Indians and
the early settlers was suffused with violence, distrust, deceit,
and perhaps more than anything, forcible and abrupt change. The
food American Indians ate, how they dressed, where and how they
lived, what language they spoke, tribal governing structures, and
how they worshiped were, for the most part, forcibly altered to
conform with the newly dominant society's cultural and moral
views. While these involuntary changes occurred several
generations ago, their impact on the American Indian culture
should not be underestimated. </p>

<p> In some instances, tribal traditions, languages, and methods
of worship were lost. Thousands of American Indian children, some
as young as 3 years old, were removed from their families and
placed in federally funded and run boarding schools, where
physical, verbal, and sexual abuse were common. Nuclear and
extended families were dispersed, and with them, a vital social
support system. Acculturation issues abounded. Children returned
home from boarding schools unable to speak their native language,
or understand the importance of their cultural traditions. These
cultural problems are multigenerational, and current studies
reveal that American Indian children report more emotional
problems, mental health problems, and low self-esteem than
non-Indian children (60). While the relationship between many of
these psychosocial/cultural antecedents and increased substance
abuse levels has yet to be formally evaluated, clearly the
American Indian people have been, and in some may continue to be,
subjected to cultural disruption. </p>

<p> Prevention programs </p>

<p> For substance abuse prevention programs to be effective
within the American Indian population it is important to realize
the diversity that exists between tribes and villages. For
example, a specific program tailored to New Mexico Navajos living
on the Navajo reservation may be culturally unacceptable to
Winnebago Indians living in urban Minneapolis, MN. However,
several fairly universal themes permeate American Indian culture:
the importance of tribal identity, which is an individual's
membership or affiliation with specific tribe(s); a belief that
each human is a multidimensional being made up of a body, mind,
and spirit, and that the spirit world coexists and intermingles
with the physical world; the importance of sharing and
generosity, allegiance to one's family and community, respect for
elders, noninterference, orientation to present time, and harmony
with nature; the importance of an oral tradition as a primary
method of teaching values, attitudes, legends, and stories; an
emphasis on observant, reflective, and integrative skills which
lead to communication patterns that give virtue to silence,
listening, nonverbal cues, and learning by example; and the
presence of rituals and symbols that are acknowledged for their
underlying significance, which is expected to emerge as time and
experience go on (72). </p>

<p> One example that assists communities in the development of
culturally sensitive programs is an instructional publication
compiled by The Four Worlds Development Project in Alberta,
Canada. Information has been collected on health promotion and
prevention efforts by various indigenous people from around the
world. The text assists American Indian communities in tailoring
program planning, training, and implementation techniques with
their culture beliefs and specific needs (24). </p>

<p> Blacks </p>

<p> A great deal of diversity exists within the black community.
One reflection of that diversity is the use of the terms African
American and black. Some researchers use African American to
define black persons who are direct descendants of men and women
brought to the United States as slaves, whereas blacks is used to
define all people and cultures of African descent, including
black people from the West Indies, Africa, and the Americas. At
times, the two terms are used interchangeably (72). For this
section, both terms will be utilized where appropriate. </p>

<p> Historically </p>

<p> Many of the first blacks to arrive in the United States did
so as slaves. Plantation owners were responsible for regulating
much of their slaves' alcohol consumption. During holidays,
alcohol was routinely distributed to the slaves in reward for
their loyalty and hard work, and the subsequent drunken revelries
were tolerated. This controlled permissiveness began to change in
the early 1800s, as clandestine groups of black slaves began
their quest for freedom. It was at this point that blacks were
prohibited from owning stills, or even being in possession of
alcoholic beverages. These laws persisted after the Civil War,
when technically, blacks had been granted citizenship (14). </p>

<p> Spanning the late 1800s through the late 1960s, hundreds of
thousands of blacks left the South and, looking for work, headed
for northern cities. This period was later described as the
&quot;Great Migration,&quot; with a total outmigration estimated
at 4.3 million individuals (72,14). This outmigration contributed
substantially to defining the large number of blacks currently
found in many of the northern urban areas. Unfortunately, many of
those seeking work did not find it, nor did they find that they
were free from racism, discrimination, and oppression. Slowly,
the numbersleaving the South decreased, and by the 1970s there
was actually some migration back into the southern states by both
northern-born blacks and individuals returning home after
unsuccessful moves to the North. </p>

<p> Prevalence statistics </p>

<p> Differences in adolescent drug use among high school seniors
by race and ethnicity were discussed earlier in this chapter (see
box 6-A). Among this group, alcohol, cigarette, and illicit drug
use was lowest among black and Asian youth, even after inclusion
of background and lifestyle factors. Obviously, a drawback to
this type of survey is that high school dropouts are not included
in the analyses. The 1991 event dropout rate (which measures the
proportion of individuals who dropped out of school over a
specified time period) for grades 10 to 12, ages 15 to 24, reveal
dropout percentages of 3.2 for whites, 6.0 for blacks, and 7.3
for Hispanics (63). While the event dropout rate for blacks is
double that of white students, low alcohol and drug usage rates
have also been found among black eighth and tenth graders, so the
low rate of substance use among black twelfth graders cannot be
due entirely to dropout rates (75). </p>

<p> While use of alcohol, cigarettes, and illicit drugs is
relatively low among blacks, data on heavy or frequent use of
such substances differs. The 1991 NHSDA data for individuals aged
12 to 20 found that 7.3 percent of whites reported heavy alcohol
use (defined as having 5 or more drinks on one occasion on 5 or
more days in the past 30 days), Hispanics reported 3.9 percent,
and blacks reported 2.7 percent. However, for those individuals
aged 21 or older, heavy alcohol use did not differ significantly
between whites and blacks (5.0 vs. 6.0 percent), but was
significantly higher among Hispanics (6.6 percent) (77). Other
studies on heavy alcohol use, by gender, have shown that white
men aged 18 to 29 report the highest prevalence of heavy
drinking, which then declined in subsequent age groups.
Conversely, the abstention rate for black males was highest among
those aged 18 to 29, while subsequent age groups showed
significantly increased levels of heavy drinking--among whom half
report either frequent heavy or frequent high maximum drinking
(70). Similarly, white women in the 18 to 29 age group were
significantly more likely to drink, and to drink heavily, than
were young black women (67). </p>

<p> Past-month use (which does not necessarily constitute abuse)
of an illicit substance by race and ethnicity was discussed at
the beginning of this section (see figure 6-2). However, the 1992
NHSDA also contains more specific data for some of the most
commonly used substances such as marijuana and cocaine. Of the
blacks age 12 and older surveyed, 3.2 reported using marijuana
once a week or more compared to 2.5 percent for whites and
Hispanics. Blacks also had the highest reported weekly use of
cocaine (0.5 percent) compared to Hispanic and white percentages
(0.4 and 0.3, respectively) (78). </p>

<p> Persistence of drug use has also been used as another
indicator of substance use severity and is measured by percent of
monthly users divided by percent of lifetime users. It has been
shown that blacks and Hispanics have a different pattern of drug
persistence from that of whites. Data on cocaine use analyzed
from the 1990 NHSDA showed that the persistence rate for blacks
age 18 to 25 was almost three times that of whites (.29 vs.. 09),
and among those aged 26 to 34, the rate for blacks was four times
higher than that for whites (.21 vs.. 05). In both age groups,
the persistence rates for Hispanics were between those of blacks
and whites. It is important to note that the differences in
persistence did not appear to extend to alcohol and marijuana
(32). </p>

<p> Psychosocial/cultural antecedents </p>

<p> At least initially, many blacks did not arrive in the United
States voluntarily. The legacy of slavery has shaped much of
black culture. Black slaves struggled with many of the same
issues as American Indians: loss of languages, traditions, and
religious beliefs; assimilation and acculturation issues; and the
breakup of nuclear and extended families. Not allowed to express
their original languages, cultures, and beliefs, blacks attempted
to establish new cultural identities amidst oppression,
segregation, and racism. </p>

<p> Hypotheses concerning alcoholism among black males have been
proposed by several studies. Some researchers believe that the
increase in the number of heavy drinkers among black males in
their thirties may be due to feelings of frustration and failure
concerning career expectations. A complementary view points to
the combination of high unemployment rates among black males
coupled with the large numbers of liquor stores found in many
urban black neighborhoods, as having contributed to the alcohol
problems faced by black men (14,82). </p>

<p> Prevention programs </p>

<p> With respect to the use of alcohol and other drugs, common
themes link blacks. In general, social stratification, church and
community involvement, and racial identity are thought to be
important variables in attitudes toward alcohol and drug use
(72,14). The level of importance will vary between individuals
and groups depending on environmental factors. One program cited
as exemplary by the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP)
is called Super II, and targets primarily at risk, black
inner-city youths 11 to 17 and their parents. The design and
implementation of the program emphasizes holism and cultural
competence, viewing them as crucial in reducing the strength of
risk factors and increasing the strength of resiliency factors.
The program takes place through already established agencies in
the communities (Boys Clubs and Girls Clubs) and incorporates the
childrens' caregivers, youth and recreational workers, police
officials, local corporations, and a variety of social service
agencies. The first-year evaluation report found reductions in
four of five major categories of alcohol- and drug- related
behavior. These included frequency of use and amount of use,
number of modalities of use, alcohol- and drug-related behavior
problems, and media influenceability (71). </p>

<p> Another antidrug abuse campaign is being waged by the
Congress of National Black Churches, Inc. (CNBC), a national
nonprofit religious organization comprised of a variety of
denominations. Through a variety of programs, the CNBC clergy are
mobilizing, creating, and coordinating groups of individuals
interested in bringing about positive change in their
communities. Program strategies are implemented in partnership
with the police, criminal justice agencies, school systems,
social service agencies, private organization and businesses, and
informal community networks to reduce the supply of and demand
for drugs. </p>

<p> Hispanics </p>

<p> Historically </p>

<p> The term Hispanic was first used by the U.S. Census Bureau in
1980 to designate those individuals who resided in the United
States and whose cultural origins were in Mexico, Puerto Rico,
Cuba, Central America, and other Latin American countries. Not
all members of this group accept the term and prefer to use
phrases such as Latino or la raza (literally, &quot;the
race&quot;). Data from the 1990 census reveal an Hispanic
population of more than 20 million, and projections indicate that
Hispanics will be the largest minority group in the United States
sometime between the years 2000 and 2010. Hispanics of Mexican
origin, by far the largest Hispanic group (63 percent), are
clustered in the southwest, particularly California and Texas.
Puerto Ricans, excluding those living on the island of Puerto
Rico, are the second largest subgroup (12 percent) and live
primarily in the Northeast, especially in and around New York
City, New York. Cubans (5 percent) live primarily around their
port of entry, Miami, Florida, though large numbers are found in
New Jersey and New York. Dominicans, who reside primarily in the
Northeastern Atlantic States, are also beginning to grow in
number. In the past 10 years, there has been a large immigration
of Central Americans to the United States. These individuals have
come primarily from civil war-plagued countries including
Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. It is highly possible that
many of the problems faced by newly arrived Hispanic immigrants
may be exacerbated among this population who have left their
countries involuntarily. Refugees escaping political turmoil or
open warfare often show signs of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
(72). </p>

<p> Prevalence statistics </p>

<p> NIDA data collected from 1975 to 1991 on drug use among
twelfth graders, as well as data from 1991 for eighth and tenth
graders, reveal the following for Hispanic students: as a group,
Hispanic youth had the highest lifetime and annual prevalence
rates in the senior year for PCP, cocaine, crack, heroin, ice,
and steroids, compared to whites and blacks, and the rates for
crack and steroid use were particularly high; among eighth
graders, Hispanics had higher rates of past month use for
virtually all the drugs surveyed including, cocaine, heroin,
inhalants, alcohol, marijuana, hallucinogens, and cigarettes. In
other words, in eighth grade, before a considerable number of
students has dropped out, Hispanic youth have the highest
prevalence of nearly all drug use, but by twelfth grade, whites
have the highest usage rates. The researchers suggest two
possible explanations, which are not necessarily exclusive. The
first being that the high dropout rate for Hispanics in later
grades (in some areas as high as 40 percent) is causing a shift
in the rates, and the second is that while Hispanic youth begin
experimenting earlier, white youth catch up by the later grades
(75). </p>

<p> National statistics for 1992 of past-month use of any illicit
substance indicated that rates for Hispanics and whites were not
significantly different, and were slightly lower than those for
blacks (see figure 6-2). The same database also revealed that for
the illicit substances measured, Hispanic rates either fell
between black and white rates, or were the lowest rates reported
by an ethnic group. The only exception would be the heavy alcohol
use data (defined as having 5 or more drinks on one occasion on 5
or more days within the past 30 days) for 1991 (1992 data not yet
available) which showed that Hispanics aged 21 or older reported
significantly more heavy alcohol use within the past month as
compared to whites and blacks (77). </p>

<p> Psychosocial/cultural antecedents </p>

<p> Dignidad, respeto, confianza--dignity, respect, and trust--
are important elements in the Hispanic culture. Like many
immigrants to the United States, Hispanics deal with language,
cultural, racial, and economic barriers. These barriers and how
they are handled within the Hispanic culture have a great deal to
do with subsequent alcohol and drug problems. To a large extent,
drinking (at times heavily) among Hispanic males is not only
expected, but encouraged. Much of the research literature has
therefore centered around alcohol and its misuse. To be able to
drink heavily and maintain &quot;control&quot; is a valued
characteristic among most Hispanic men (38). Personal identities
for a vast majority of Hispanic men are intricately entwined with
the notion of machismo, which generally connotes strength,
masculinity, independence, and responsibility (1). The man of the
family is expected to provide for and take care of his wife and
children. For those who may be unable to fulfill this role, due
to difficulties learning English and/or procuring employment, the
social drinking pattern can change from one of low frequency and
high quantity, to high frequency and high quantity (38,1). This
drinking pattern varies between Hispanic groups, however. A study
completed in 1981 found that drinking levels among newly arrived
Dominicans, Guatemalans, and Puerto Ricans, when compared to
preimmigration levels, decreased, increased, and remained the
same, respectively (1). </p>

<p> As is relatively true for other cultures, heavy drinking is
not condoned for Hispanic women. This is not to say that it does
not exist. While the majority of first generation Hispanic women
generally abstain or drink very little, changes in drinking
patterns among the following generations have been observed. To
the distress of many first generational Hispanic families, as
their daughters and granddaughters become increasingly
acculturated, the drinking patterns and alcohol problems more
closely mirror those found in the general population (26).
Another change observed among more acculturated Hispanic women is
the diminishment of marianismo, which is the female complement to
machismo, and encompasses such behaviors as submissiveness,
humility, tolerance, virtuosity, and devotion to the male
(whether father, husband, or first son). </p>

<p> Prevention programs </p>

<p> Important intergroup differences need to be understood for
the planning, implementation, and evaluation of substance abuse
prevention programs. For example, while two immigrants, one
Mexican and the other El Salvadorian, may both speak Spanish and
may both be experiencing many of the same difficulties in
adjusting to life in the United States, they are very likely to
have had vastly different lifetime and cultural experiences (72).

Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) have been distributed to several
demonstration projects throughout the United States and Puerto
Rico that target high-risk Hispanic youth and their families.
Many of these programs are similar to others previously outlined
in this report in their attempt to be as comprehensive as
possible through the coordination of families, schools, law
enforcement, and local social services and businesses. Several of
the programs are creating their own audiovisual and written
materials in Spanish, others are utilizing activities such as
English courses, puppet shows, and live theater performances,
while others employ peer group counseling and mentoring programs
(69). </p>

<p> Asian and Pacific Island Americans </p>

<p> Historically </p>

<p> According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Asian and Pacific Island
Americans are the fastest growing population in the United
States. Between 1980 and 1988, the number of Asian and Pacific
Island Americans increased by 76 percent compared with an
increase of 36 percent within the Hispanic population. Similar to
the other racial and ethnic categories, the term Asian and
Pacific Island American gives one the impression of homogeneity,
while in reality, over 60 different racial and ethnic groups are
lumped in this bracket. Some of the diverse populations included
in this group are Hawaiians, Guamanians, Filipinos, Thais,
Bengalis, and Sri Lankans. Beside the obvious differences in
language, and cultural norms and beliefs, is the degree to which
different subpopulations have acculturated and/or assimilated to
the dominant culture. Many Chinese and Japanese families have
been in the United States for three generations or more, which is
in sharp contrast to the majority of first-generation Vietnamese,
Koreans, Asian Indians, and Filipinos (72,85). </p>

<p> Prevalence statistics </p>

<p> Research on substance use and abuse within the Asian and
Pacific Island American population appears to be sporadic, and
often limited to alcohol. While the three national surveys NHSDA,
the National Adolescent School Health Survey, and the High School
Senior Survey, all collect separate data for Asian and Pacific
Island Americans, only the High School Senior Survey routinely
analyzes the data separately. Due to small sample sizes, the
remaining two surveys included Asian and Pacific Islanders under
the racial and ethnic category of &quot;other.&quot; </p>

<p> Research on alcohol consumption patterns among adult Asian
and Pacific Island Americans consistently shows that this
population drinks substantially less than whites and Hispanics,
and slightly less than blacks. Though subgroup variation does
exist, as data reveal, native Hawaiians drink at levels
comparable to those of whites, among mainland Asian Americans,
Japanese Americans drink the most, followed by Koreans and
Chinese Americans. However, Japanese, Korean, and Filipino men
all have roughly the same percentage of heavy drinkers at 28
percent. This style of heavy drinking is typically associated
with business entertainment and after work socializing (68).
Among Asian and Pacific Island American women, four-fifths of
Korean and Filipino women were reported to be abstainers, as were
two-thirds of Chinese women, and one-third of Japanese women.
Among women who drank, the percentage who did so heavily varied:
12 percent for Japanese women; less than 4 percent for Filipino
women; and virtually none for Chinese and Korean women (68). A
similar statistic for white women showed 14.5 percent reported
drinking heavily (73). Evidence suggests, however, that the
prevalence of drinking may be on the rise among both men and
women Asian and Pacific Island Americans, although the exact
reasons for this remain unclear. Some researchers have suggested
that paralleling other immigrant populations, the more
acculturated and assimilated generations will tend to adopt the
drinking patterns of the dominant culture. Yet other researchers
point to the fact that a significant number of second and third
generation Asian and Pacific Island Americans have not adopted a
more copious style of drinking. </p>

<p> For adolescent Asian Americans, the majority of the studies
mirrors the findings for the adults--this group consistently has
the lowest prevalence of alcohol and other drug use for all
racial and ethnic groups with the possible exception of black
youth. Although, a prospective study conducted in North Carolina
found an alarming increase in reported alcohol and other drug use
among Asian Americans over a three-year period in the late 1980s.
The reason for this increase at a time when prevalence rates for
other races and ethnicities was decreasing remains unknown (72).
Another study on youth in California reported that Chinese
American youth used quaaludes twice as often as white and
Hispanic youth, and five times as often as black youth (68).
Drinking statistics for Asian American youth are again similar to
those reported by the adult population, that is, their overall
prevalence rate is one of the lowest, but statistics for heavy
drinking are similar to those found among white youth (72). </p>

<p> Psychosocial/cultural antecedents </p>

<p> Why does this population have such low overall rates of
alcohol and other drug use? The diversity present within the
Asian and Pacific Island American group makes it impossible to
list all the different cultural factors that could influence
alcohol and drug use patterns. However, among many of the
subpopulations, anthropologists and substance abuse experts have
found the existence of the following philosophies: moderation,
family reputation, humility, keeping a low profile, negative
community sanctions on excessive drinking and behavior, and the
impact of parental drinking practices (83). Among Chinese
specifically, alcohol is in an important part of many religious
and celebratory ceremonies, yet excessive use is strongly
discouraged. </p>

<p> One study in California uncovered additional behavioral
factors that influenced drinking patterns among some Asian
American men. Japanese respondents were heavily influenced by
their friends' drinking; among Chinese men, those with more
education were more likely to drink; and Korean men were strongly
influenced by their parents' drinking habits (68). </p>

<p> Few researchers have examined psychosocial influences on
Asian and Pacific Island American adolescent drinking or other
drug use. One factor which has been mentioned, though, is the
pressure Asian American youth, in particular, are under to
succeed, especially academically. Thirty-four percent of Asian
Americans are college educated, more than twice that of the
United States population as a whole. Those with the least amount
of college education were American Indians (7.7 percent) and
Pacific Islanders (9.3 percent). Asian parents are similar to
parents, in general, in their hopes for their children's success.
However, among some subpopulations (notably Japanese, Korean, and
Chinese) the feelings for their children are often tied to the
child's academic achievement. When their children perform poorly
in school, some parents respond with strong
criticism,disapproval, and shame. This can understandably add a
substantial amount of stress to an adolescent who may already be
coping with language and cultural differences (72). </p>

<p> Prevention programs </p>

<p> Mainstream culture in the United States, to a great degree,
emphasizes individuality, competitiveness, and monetary success.
Conversely, for many Asian and Pacific Island Americans the
qualities most stressed are the needs of the family, sharing and
generosity, and a belief in who you are rather than what you own.
Because the extended family is so important in many of the
cultures, it is often the first group that an individual with
problems will turn to versus an &quot;outsider&quot; or social
service agency. Substance abuse prevention practitioners need to
be aware of the strong resistance within many Asian and Pacific
Island Americans to seek outside assistance. </p>

<p> One innovative substance abuse program entitled Na Keiki O
Ka`Aina (Children of the Land) is being implemented in Oahu,
Hawaii. Children attending the local Makaha elementary school
work several hours a week on a farm where they learn to care for
the land, their environment, and themselves as alternatives to
lifestyles that rely on alcohol and other drugs. The program uses
the cultural values of native Hawaiians, which emphasize
&quot;warm, open friendship and love,&quot; love of the earth,
and other spiritual values. Since the program's inception, class
behavior has noticeably improved, English scores have increased,
and a survey measuring drug use in the district schools showed
that Makaha school was the only school that reported a decrease
(74). </p>

<p> Areas for Future Research Among Different Racial and Ethnic
Groups </p>

<p> While this section of the report has reiterated the need to
view racial and ethnic groups as heterogeneous, the majority of
substance abuse data is not collected or examined in this way. To
date, a variety of distinct cultures are usually grouped under
one classification, and generalizations are made concerning this
group's drug use. While substance abuse prevention programs are
often better tailored to specific subpopulations and cultures, it
is virtually impossible to adequately evaluate these programs
when little baseline substance abuse data exists for specific
subpopulations. There is therefore room for improvement in the
collection of prevalence data on alcohol and other drug use and
abuse among distinct racial and ethnic groups. Furthermore, long-
term prospective studies, which are essential for understanding
risk and protective factors specific to different groups, are
extremely scarce. </p>

<p> Biomedical research on different racial and ethnic groups has
also been inconclusive and scanty (with the possible exception of
alcohol research and Asians). </p>

<p> ECONOMICS </p>

<p> Economics can be viewed as a factor in individual substance
abuse in two ways. In areas where substance abuse is already well
established and viable employment opportunities are scarce,
selling illicit substances can seem very appealing. Several
questions arise from this scenario. Are individuals lured into
the world of illegal drug sales by income potential? And, are
drug dealers more likely to become drug abusers because they are
dealers? Both of these questions have been addressed under the
first section. </p>

<p> A parallel issue is that of poverty and the daily stresses
encountered by individuals living in chronically poor areas. Do
individuals living in these poor areas abuse substances in
greater numbers or are fewer social services available in these
areas, and thus the consequences from substance abuse are more
acutely felt and visible? </p>

<p> Generated Income </p>

<p> While few studies have attempted to ascertain the individual
incomes of drug dealers, two studies have concentrated on the
street sale of illicit drugs by urban youth (21,52). The research
revealed that individual dealers reported mean gross monthly
incomes of $3,558 to $5,934. Even if these self-reported earnings
were exaggerated, this sum of money is clearly more than many
urban youth could hope to obtain in legitimate jobs at a median
of $7 per hour. </p>

<p> This earning potential may be a serious obstacle to
prevention, intervention, and treatment programs targeted toward
urban adolescents. The staff at an innovative treatment program
for drug dealers in Baltimore, Maryland, has discovered the
difficulties former dealers have in giving up the fast lifestyles
they once led. </p>

<p> Most dealers say they do it because of the money,&quot; says
a staff counselor. &quot;They can't see working at McDonald's for
minimum wage when they're making $500 to $1,000 per day,&quot; he
adds. Counselors try to help clients think beyond the idea of
making fast money to the moral, social and legal issues
associated with drug dealing. They find, however, that the moral
issue is not always clear-cut. In many cases, clients are
supporting their families and it is hard for them to see they are
doing something wrong when they are paying the bills. </p>

<p> Overall, counselors say their clients are addicted to the
money. &quot;What we do is help them see what is all around them,
what they're doing to themselves and their community by selling
drugs (48). </p>

<p> The potential for monetary gain may be especially true within
the crack trade. A young black male from San Francisco,
California, explained his preference for the immediate rewards of
selling crack over the seemingly meaningless rituals of school: </p>

<p> Forget about school. I'd rather have a life of selling drugs.
?.?. When you go to school, you do nothing. You sit around, have
books in your backpack, take`em home, do your homework, come back
to school, get some grade. When you sell drugs, see, I had
satisfaction of seeing my work, getting some money for it (22). </p>

<p> It would appear then that for many urban youth, selling
illicit drugs supplies purpose, companionship, and income without
compromising dignity. More money can be gained from the sale of
illicit drugs than through petty crimes, and certainly more than
through minimum wage jobs. </p>

<p> Another issue to be addressed is the dealer-turned-client.
From the two previously cited studies, dealers were estimated to
spend between 59 and 71 percent of their income each month on the
purchase of illicit drugs. For example, out of $3,558 gross per
month, $1,226 was spent purchasing additional drugs for business,
$883 was spent on drugs for personal consumption, and an
additional $533 on expenses associated with drug dealing. </p>

<p> The Urban Institute has also reviewed the relationship
between using and selling drugs. Its study population was
composed of 387 inner-city adolescent males of ninth- and tenth-
grade age. Of this sample, 79.6 percent reported that they
neither used nor sold drugs within the past year. Of the
remainder, 19.0 percent reported both using and selling drugs,
44.3 percent reported selling only, and 36.7 percent reported
using only. They also discovered that the greater the level of
involvement in either using or selling, the higher the likelihood
of doing both (13). </p>

<p> In summary, the research completed thus far neither confirms
nor negates the possible influence income potential has on luring
individuals into drug dealing. Nor can one conclude that drug
dealers are more likely to become substance abusers than
nondealers. </p>

<p> Poverty </p>

<p> Alcohol and drug problems are present not only among the
poor, but are poor individuals at greater risk for developing
these problems? While a relatively straight forward question, not
only is poverty difficult to define, but drawing conclusions
concerning an individual's potential for future substance abuse
based on one or two variables, such as family income or
educational level, is overly simplistic and deceptive. To
adequately review this question, a milieu of both individual and
aggregate measures should be present in any analysis done. </p>

<p> In recent years, great attention has been paid to the plight
of the urban poor, many of whom are minorities. These inner- city
communities are often riddled with high rates of crime, violence,
unemployment, and inadequate social and medical services. For
individuals living in these localities, the consequences of these
problems are serious and far reaching. Yet according to the 1980
census only 9 percent of all the poor, and 21 percent of all the
poor blacks, lived in these types of areas. </p>

<p> To define the problems of the urban poor as predominantly
&quot;black problems&quot; does a disservice to the two-thirds of
African Americans who are not poor, as well as to the two- thirds
of the poor in our central cities who are not black (8). </p>

<p> Poverty within rural communities, while lacking much of the
violence and crime of urban areas, is no less oppressive. In
1987, compared with the general population, rural residents were
less likely to be employed and to have completed high school.
They had lower average incomes and higher poverty rates than did
urban residents, and one out of every six rural families lived in
poverty (compared with one in eight urban families). This ratio
approached one out of two for black rural families. Areas of
chronic poverty were concentrated in the South, where 25 million
of the Nation's 57 million rural residents live (48 percent), and
where four out of every ten rural residents were poor, elderly,
or both (61). </p>

<p> To assess poverty and its relationship to alcohol and drug
abuse problems, one must find appropriate measures. Some
researchers have utilized the Federal guidelines for poverty,
while others employ measures of Socioeconomic Status (SES), such
as educational level and household income. To date, the largest
and most comprehensive analysis of SES variables and substance
use has been accomplished by NIDA (76). Both bivariate and
multivariate analyses were completed on data collected in 1988
and 1990 from NHSDA (see box 6-C). </p>

<p> The NIDA report has two major limitations. First, the
analysis focused on indicators of drug and alcohol use, rather
than indicators of problem use or hard-core use. While the report
has categories for frequent/heavy use and recent use, it cannot
be assumed that individuals who reported such use had alcohol or
drug problems. Secondly, the report lacks data for transient,
homeless, or institutionalized individuals, many of whom have
serious alcohol and/or drug problems. </p>

<p> Table 6-3 presents the findings from the multivariate
analysis of the NHSDA data. The SES variables pertinent to a
possible link between poverty and substance use are educational
level, occupation of chief wage earner, employment status, number
of jobs held in past 5 years, median housing value, and percent
of housing that is owned. Neither personal income nor household
income were included in the analysis, as personal income was most
meaningful only for persons who worked and household income data
were not available in the 1988 survey. </p>

<p> Alcohol consumption within the past month was measured on
three levels: abstinence; nonheavy use; and heavy use. Marijuana
use was measured by any past-month use and cocaine use was
measured by any past-year use (both categories could include
frequent as well as casual users). Major findings from the
analysis include: </p>

<p> o SES variables associated with poverty and predictive of
past month abstinence from alcohol were: not having worked in the
past 5 years and having lived in a census block with a high
percentage of owner occupancy. For users, versus abstainers, SES
attributes predictive of nonheavy alcohol use included having
attended college (regardless of completion) and living in census
areas with high housing values. Significant for heavy alcohol use
was not having completed high school, holding three or more jobs
in the past 5 years, and living in a census area with low housing
values. No employment status or occupational categories were
found to be independently predictive of heavy alcohol use. </p>

<p> o For any past-month marijuana use the independent SES
predictors associated with poverty were being unemployed and
having held three or more jobs in the past 5 years. Individuals
who reported no marijuana use in the past month were more likely
to have had some degree of college participation. </p>

<p> o Many of the SES predictors for cocaine use in the past year
were similar to those identified for marijuana use: being
unemployed and having worked three or more jobs in the past 5
years. SES characteristics predictive of no reported cocaine use
in the past year were being a college graduate and having a
part-time job. </p>

<p> This type of analysis is an exercise in inclusion and
exclusion. A myriad of individual and aggregate characteristics
are initially considered in the equation and, depending on the
outcome of interest, whether it be heavy alcohol use or marijuana
use in the past month, different variables will show themselves
to be either predictive or not predictive of the outcome. Because
personal income and household income were not included in the
multivariate analysis, but are often used as SES measures for
poverty, tables 6-4 and 6-5 depict the bivariate analysis done by
NIDA (76). Again, this analysis reveals associations, not
causality. </p>

<p> Personal income (which is highly correlated with an
individual's age and sex) was examined only for respondents who
reported working full time during the year prior to the survey.
Associations between personal income and drug use were
significant for most drugs. For every drug use measure (except
past-month use of alcohol), plus heavy use of alcohol, the
percentage of users declined as the income level rose.
Differences between income levels for frequent use of marijuana
and cocaine, concurrent heavy use of alcohol with marijuana, and
use of psychotherapeutics, hallucinogens, inhalants, and crack
were all statistically significant and more than twice as common
in the lowest income group as in the highest. Low income was also
associated with higher rates of abstinence from alcohol as well
as higher rates of heavy drinking. </p>

<p> The associations between household income (which is less
affected by age and sex) and drug and alcohol use were
considerably weaker than those observed for personal income. The
only statistically significant associations were for alcohol use,
concurrent heavy alcohol use with marijuana, and use of
hallucinogens. Those with household incomes of $40,000 or higher
were about twice as likely as those with incomes of less than
$12,000 to have used any amount of alcohol in the past month.
However, the rates of heavy drinking differed little across the
income levels. Other categories of drug use appear to be slightly
less common among the wealthiest households, but, in general,
drug use was not strongly related to household income. </p>

<p> From these types of analyses, a straightforward &quot;yes or
no&quot; response to the initial question, which linked poverty
to increased individual risk for drug abuse, is clearly
impossible. The NIDA analyses demonstrated that the type and
quantity of an individual's substance use is correlated with a
variety of both individual as well as geographic characteristics.
Furthermore, while the NIDA report was the largest and most
comprehensive to date, some segments of the population, many of
whom were possible alcohol and drug abusers, were excluded from
the survey. </p>

<p> As one economist noted, &quot;There is much we still need to
learn about poverty. Much of the past research has focused
primarily on economic questions, reflecting the extensive
involvement by economists in this work. Research is much more
limited on topics such as the causes of changing family
structures, the impacts of neighborhoods and family structure on
children's opportunities in life, personal and family coping
strategies among the poor, how expectations about future
opportunities are formed, and how these expectations influence
behavior&quot; (8). </p>

<p> PSYCHOSOCIAL/BEHAVIORAL </p>

<p> Aggressiveness </p>

<p> In much of the research literature the term aggression is
used almost exclusively when referring to young children and
adolescents between the ages of 13 and 15. Shortly after this age
a divergence appears within this identified aggressive group. The
vast majority of children &quot;outgrow&quot; their aggressive
behavior, while a smaller percentage progress into or also
exhibit, among other things, conduct disorders, antisocial
behavior, delinquency, and violence. Discussing each of these
areas is beyond the scope of this report. However, it should be
noted that as is true for many individual risk factors, a number
of these behaviors are intricately meshed. </p>

<p> Definitions for the term aggression vary considerably and may
include tardiness, breaking rules, fighting, vandalism, cruelty
to animals, and verbal abuse of other children. Many studies
simply fail to define it. Wherever possible, study definitions of
aggression will be outlined. </p>

<p> The children in the various studies on aggressiveness and
subsequent drug abuse ranged in age from 5 to 20 years old.
Aggressive behavior in the majority of the studies was exhibited
almost exclusively by boys. While girls were included in the
study populations, the number exhibiting aggressive behavior was
very small. However, the presence of aggressive behavior among
some young girls has not been shown to be predictive of later
adolescent delinquency or substance use (49). This disparity
between the sexes has not been addressed at any length. </p>

<p> Of the preadolescent boys who exhibited aggressive behavior,
30 to 40 percent maintained this behavior into adolescence. This
continued aggression has been shown to be a strong predictor of
subsequent alcohol and drug problems (28,33, 51). Interestingly,
the combination of shy and aggressive behavior has also been
correlated with later substance use problems. It has been
postulated that aggressive boys may be more likely to be shunned
by conventional peer groups, but accepted by other aggressive
children who could encourage drug and alcohol use. Another
theory, while not confirmed, suggests that young children
rejected by conventional peer groups gravitate toward each other
and that these groups of former so-called loners may foster
delinquent behavior in later adolescence (28). Conversely, boys
(but not girls) exhibiting shy behavior have been shown as less
likely to partake in alcohol and drug using activities as they
grew older (28,33,51). </p>

<p> Where does this aggressive behavior originate? Some studies
have shown that young children exhibiting sociable, spontaneous,
and fearless behavior are at greater risk for future aggressive
and violent conduct. Factors that seem to be protective include a
shy temperament, being first born, having a small and stable
family characterized by low discord (i.e., effective family
management), and having parents who regularly attend religious
services (51). </p>

<p> Current psychological perspectives emphasize that aggressive
and violent behaviors are &quot;learned&quot; responses to
frustration, that they can also be learned as instruments for
achieving goals, and that the learning occurs by observing models
of such behavior. Such models may be observed in the family,
among peers, elsewhere in the neighborhood, and through the mass
media (51). </p>

<p> This observation could, in part, explain why so few young
girls are identified as aggressive. While socially defined roles
for adults have changed considerably in the last several decades,
the socialization of children's behavior to a large extent has
not. Certain behaviors by boys are still classified by many
adults under the &quot;boys-will-be-boys&quot; axiom, while the
same behaviors by girls are oftenconsidered inappropriate. </p>

<p> Biological and genetic precursors to aggressiveness have also
been explored. Events associated with brain dysfunction that
appear to increase an individual's potential for aggression
include: brain injuries; in vitro exposure to opiates, cocaine,
alcohol, and tobacco; and early environmental exposure to lead
(e.g., air contaminated by leaded fuels, lead-based paint, water
from older plumbing systems) (51). </p>

<p> No genetic studies specific to aggressive behavior have been
conducted. Several Scandinavian countries have researched the
association between genetics and violence, obtaining mixed
results. No such studies have been attempted in the United States
(51). </p>

<p> By understanding the antecedents of aggressive behavior,
prevention programs targeted at reducing such behavior are much
more likely to succeed. It has been asserted that
multidimensional programs are more effective than those that
focus on one or two components of aggressiveness. Researcher
Karen Dodge submits: </p>

<p> Most intervention approaches are implemented without regard
for the type of aggressive behavior under scrutiny, and that
different types of aggression are likely to respond differently
to different types of intervention. Reactive aggressive children
who overly attribute hostility to others in provocative
situations may respond best to treatment aimed at training them
to understand better others' thoughts and feelings. Proactively
aggressive children may respond more favorably to consistent
punishment of aggressive behavior and reinforcement of
nonaggressive responses; this latter group many also have a
better prognosis than the former group. Three intervention
programs cited as being particularly suitable for differential
implementation with these two types of aggressive children
include social problem-solving skills training, anger-control
training, and parent training (17). </p>

<p> Several unanswered questions point to areas for future
research. Why do boys disproportionately exhibit aggressive
behavior? Are specific aggressive behaviors unique to certain
subpopulations? What are the differences between those
individuals who &quot;grow out of&quot; their aggressive behavior
and those who do not? </p>

<p> Answers to these questions and others will allow for more
detailed understanding of aggressive behavior and its connection
to alcohol and drug abuse, which could in turn provide for an
improved structure for the planning of appropriate prevention
programs. </p>

<p> Delinquency and Crime </p>

<p> Similar to aggression research, studies define and collect
data on delinquency and crime differently. Some studies use the
two terms interchangeably, while others define delinquent acts as
those less serious versus acts such as rape, armed robbery, and
manslaughter, which are clearly illegal. Self-reported data are
relied on by some studies, while others utilize only arrest
records. These differences must be considered when attempting to
generalize delinquent behavior to subsequent misuse of alcohol
and drugs. </p>

<p> As is true for aggressiveness, males are at greater risk for
developing delinquent and criminal behavior. Delinquent behavior
for most youths appears to peak between the ages of 15 to 17,
while alcohol and drug use are on the rise. However, only a small
percentage (2 to 6 percent) of these adolescents become young
adults who continue to engage in serious criminal activity
coupled with frequent drug use. Statistics reveal that many
arrests for property and violent crimes can be attributed to this
small group of individuals (29). </p>

<p> Several researchers have linked delinquent and criminal
behavior to alcohol and drug abuse and have concluded these
activities precede the use and abuse of certain substances
(28,29,13,56). </p>

<p> One such study conducted on adolescents examined the
relationship between later drug use and earlier individual
delinquent behavior and delinquent peer group bonding (DPGB).
Females were found less likely to engage in individual delinquent
behavior before but not after participating in a delinquent peer
group. Additionally, minority students doing well in school had
lower rates of delinquent problems than did nonminority youth who
were also doing well in school. Strong positive belief systems
(beliefs that committing illegal or rule-violating acts are
morally wrong) also decreased the potential for future use of
alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs. Conversely, those
adolescents who had high DPGB levels had increased rates of
alcohol, marijuana, and polydrug use (20). </p>

<p> A separate study of male and female cocaine addicts analyzed
the psychosocial factors present among individuals who
substantially increased their cocaine use from adolescence to
young adulthood. Those who progressed to heavier use displayed a
significant lack of law abidance or social conformity (46). </p>

<p> Several points have come to light from studies on heroin
addicts. Studies conducted in the late 1970s found that while
delinquency preceded illicit drug use, use of alcohol and first
alcohol intoxication took place before delinquency. In fact, an
average of two years lapsed between first alcohol intoxication
and first criminal activity for both males and females who later
became heroin addicts (64). A further study on male heroin
addicts that grouped participants into low-crime versus
high-crime categories found that men who had been placed in the
high-crime group admitted significantly more contact with the
criminal justice system before becoming addicted than did those
in the low-crime group. Also, the high-crime group showed earlier
and more frequent use of substances, as well as use of a wider
variety of narcotic and nonnarcotic substances (47). </p>

<p> While a relatively small number of individuals who exhibit
delinquent behavior progress to serious alcohol and drug
problems, understanding the cause(s) of the delinquent behavior
may help to decrease this number further. Psychosocial elements
that have been associated with later delinquent behavior include:
</p>

<p> o low parent-child attachment </p>

<p> o family conflict </p>

<p> o family social deprivation </p>

<p> o school failure </p>

<p> o parental and sibling drug use and criminal behavior </p>

<p> o poor and inconsistent family management practices (e.g.,
harsh or lax discipline, lack of supervision) </p>

<p> o attitudes and beliefs </p>

<p> o lack of neighborhood attachment and community
disorganization </p>

<p> o family mobility. </p>

<p> Neurophysiological and cognitive dimensions have also been
examined for serious delinquents, adult criminals, and children
with conduct disorders. However, the findings were scanty and
inconclusive (29,37). </p>

<p> When discussing prevention programs for these children, there
is the hazard of labeling them predelinquent. This concern could
be applied equally to most risk factors linked to future alcohol
and drug problems. Labeling children as aggressive, high risk,
delinquent, or developmentally slow may be a self-fulfilling
prophecy. Some researchers have suggested that broad,
encompassing programs should be implemented in targeted areas
where groups exhibit a number of the risk factors previously
described. This type of approach would not single out individuals
but rather would assist communities, schools, and families (29). </p>

<p> Physical and Sexual Abuse </p>

<p> Researchers and clinicians have increasingly addressed the
possibility that physical and sexual abuse, especially in
childhood, may be associated with an increased likelihood of
later substance abuse and addiction. Although there are many gaps
in this literature, and substantive and methodological issues
that remain to be addressed, findings from several studies that
have measured the prevalence of substance abuse strongly suggest
that additional research and the evaluation of targeted clinical
interventions are warranted. This section highlights selected
research findings on the relationship of physical and sexual
abuse to later substance abuse. </p>

<p> One review article on physical abuse found that children
subjected to physical abuse had higher levels of later substance
abuse compared to children not physically victimized. The review
also cited another study which found that 84 percent of the
females in treatment for alcohol or drug addiction reported a
history of childhood abuse (18). </p>

<p> Childhood sexual abuse appears to be rising. The National
Incidence Study reported in 1988 that approximately 156,000
children had been recognized by public agencies (such as child
protective service agencies, mental health agencies, and the
schools) as being sexually abused each year, for an annual rate
of about 0.3 percent (58). This is an increase in recognized
cases of child sexual abuse of more than 300 percent between 1980
and 1988, and due to the sensitive nature of the topic, is
probably a gross underestimation of the actual numbers of cases. </p>

<p> Prevalence statistics on childhood sexual assault specific to
women range from 6 to 62 percent, depending on the definitions,
methodology, and study populations used (54). One study that
relied on a random sampling method discovered that of the 391
women who agreed to participate in the study, almost 34 percent
reported being sexually assaulted by age 18, which provides a
lifetime prevalence rate of one out of every three women. Of the
respondents, over 24 percent reported an experience such as rape,
15 percent had been victims of molestation, and 10 percent
reported some type of noncontact sexual assault (e.g., voyeurism,
verbal threats of sexual assault, being forced to watch
pornography) (54). Other researchers, measuring childhood
molestation histories among women psychiatric outpatients, have
cited figures of 50 to 70 percent, versus 20 to 30 percent
reported by women in nonclinical populations (12). </p>

<p> While causality has not been established between childhood
sexual abuse and later substance abuse problems, an association
between the two variables has been shown. Several review articles
have summarized the findings from researchers who consistently
report that children exposed to sexual abuse present with a
greater number of symptoms and problems compared to children who
are not victimized (12,34,55). While substance abuse problems are
not measured in all the studies, where it is measured,
individuals who have been sexually abused show a much higher
incidence of later substance abuse than their study counterparts
(55). For example, 60 to 80 percent of individuals in substance
abuse treatment programs report having been sexual abused (12).
Other researchers have classified common symptoms by age group,
discovering that among adolescents who had been sexually abused
at some time in their lives, 53 percent reported abusing some
substance (34). </p>

<p> Studies on sexually abused women have demonstrated similarly
high rates. One study of women requesting appointments at a
crisis counseling unit of a community health center found that 44
percent of the women walk-in clients reported a history of sexual
abuse as children. The sexually abused women differed from the
nonabused women in many ways, but they differed most in their
substance abuse. The abused women were about 10 times more likely
than the nonabused women in this population to report a history
of drug abuse (21.1 percent vs. 2.3 percent) and more than twice
as likely to report a history of alcoholism (26.9 percent vs.
10.5 percent) (11). </p>

<p> A review of four separate studies on women seeking treatment
for alcoholism shows 34 to 85 percent of the women report a
history of sexual abuse (30); and among recovering chemically
dependent women, the topics discussed most often are sexual child
abuse, incest, and rape. Uncovering the memories of these early
childhood experiences is thought to be a contributing factor in
drug relapse for some women (31). Thus, early experiences of
abuse, especially sexual abuse, may require attention in
treatment programs, since they may have been important precursors
and contributors to the substance abuse and addiction, and may be
major obstacles to successful treatment and the prevention of
relapse. </p>

<p> Clearly, physical and sexual abuse are not uncommon
phenomena. While this section has focused on the association
between abusive experiences and subsequent substance abuse, there
are many other psychopathologies that also arise from sexual and
physical abuse. The research question need not be whether
physical and sexual abuse &quot;cause&quot; the later substance
abuse and addiction. Clearly, many factors interact, especially
in the home, school, and peer settings of children as they grow
up. However, the consistent finding of higher levels of physical
and sexual abuse among substance abusers warrants further
research to disentangle the many factors that are at work. Unlike
race, ethnicity, and poverty (which are not by themselves
strongly and independently associated with substance abuse and
addiction, but must be understood in the context of subcultures
and the availability and marketing of drugs in neighborhoods and
communities), physical and sexual abuse may more directly
contribute to later behavioral problems, including substance
abuse. </p>

<p> Mental Disorders </p>

<p> The sheer number of Americans with mental disorders
transforms personal tragedy into a widespread public health
problem. Nearly one in three American adults will experience a
mental disorder during his or her lifetime. Moreover,
approximately 1.7 to 2.4 million Americans currently suffer from
a persistent and severely disabling mental disorder, such as
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (commonly known as manic
depression) (62). </p>

<p> There exists a wide array of behaviors classified as
symptomatic of mental disorders, ranging from premenstrual
syndrome, hostility toward others, and other maladaptive
personality traits, to full-blown psychosis (2). It can at times
be difficult to delineate where mental health ends and mental
illness begins. </p>

<p> While many alcohol and drug problems may not be attributable
primarily to mental disorders, they can certainly be exacerbated
by these disorders. One comprehensive study found a high
prevalence of comorbid (i.e., occurring at the same time) mental
disorders and alcohol or other drug disorders--including both
abuse and dependence syndromes as defined in the DSM-III-R. Using
data from NIMH's Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) survey of
20,291 adults (aged 18 and older) in communities and in various
institutional settings (prisons, mental hospitals, nursing homes,
and specialized treatment centers), they assessed the prevalence
of comorbid alcohol, other drug, and mental disorders.
Schizophrenia, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders were among
those studied. Specific drugs studied, in addition to alcohol,
included marijuana, cocaine, opiates, barbiturates, amphetamines,
and hallucinogens (50). </p>

<p> Alcohol Disorder as the Primary Diagnosis </p>

<p> An estimated 13.5 percent of all adults in the United States
will have a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence
(see figure 6-3). For these individuals, the rate of mental
disorder was almost double that of persons with no history of an
alcohol disorder, and the rate of another drug disorder was
almost six times greater. Specific comorbid mental disorders
found in people with alcohol abuse- dependence disorder include
anxiety disorders (19.4 percent), mood disorders (13.4 percent),
and schizophrenia (3.8 percent). </p>

<p> Drug Disorder (Other than Alcohol) as the Primary Diagnosis </p>

<p> Some 6.1 percent of the total adult population will have had
a primary diagnosis of drug abuse or dependency at some time in
their lives. Over half of these individuals have also been
diagnosed with a comorbid mental disorder such as anxiety
disorder (28.3 percent), mood disorder (26.4 percent), or
schizophrenia (6.8 percent). Compared to those persons without a
drug disorder, these individuals are at more than four times the
risk of having some type of mental disorder. Additionally, these
individuals are also seven times more likely to be addicted to
alcohol. </p>

<p> Mental Disorder as the Primary Diagnosis </p>

<p> In contrast, at some time in their lives nearly one-quarter
of all adults in the United States will have had a primary
diagnosis of mental disorder. Compared with individuals having no
history of mental disorder, people with a mental disorder face
twice the odds of having alcohol abuse- dependence and over four
times the odds of drug abuse dependence. </p>

<p> Comorbid alcohol and other drug abuse or dependence disorders
occur frequently in people with the specific subtypes of mental
disorders included in the study: </p>

<p> o Of those who develop schizophrenia and related disorders
during their lifetimes (approximately 1.5 percent of the U.S.
population), nearly half will abuse or be dependent on alcohol or
other drugs, or both. </p>

<p> o Thirty-two percent of people with mood disorders (8.3
percent of the total adult population) will abuse or become
dependent on alcohol, other drugs, or both. </p>

<p> o The anxiety disorders, as a group, occur at sometime in the
lives of 14.6 percent of the population and are highly likely to
be associated with an alcohol or other drug abuse or dependence
disorder. For example, 35.8 percent of people with panic
disorder, and 32.8 percent of people with obsessive-compulsive
disorder will have some form of alcohol or other drug abuse or
dependence disorder. </p>

<p> People with both mental disorders and alcohol or other drug
disorders are likely to suffer more severe psychiatric symptoms,
disruptive behaviors, aggression, and criminal behaviors. The
importance of early detection for mental disorders is clear if
subsequent alcohol and drug abuse problems are to be avoided. In
other cases, an individual's drug and/or alcohol problems may
precede his or her mental disorder. In whatever order these
complications are distinguished, it is essential to remember that
millions of men and women suffer through not one, but two
illnesses (62). </p>

<p> Resiliency </p>

<p> The majority of funding and research has been devoted to
understanding and identifying those elements that appear to place
individuals at a greater risk for substance abuse. However, many
of these same factors can, to some degree, be protective. For
example, the vast majority of adolescents who have used alcohol,
cigarettes, and other drugs do not grow up to become substance
abusing adults. The process of aging and successfully passing
through various developmental stages is in itself protective. In
other cases, the lack of a particular factor is protective. This
is true for many of the psychosocial factors such as
aggressivity, delinquency, mental disorders, and physical and
sexual abuse. </p>

<p> But what about those individuals who live in stressful and
chaotic conditions--who are constantly exposed to many of these
risk factors--yet who do not develop substance abuse problems.
How do these individuals emerge relatively unscathed, while many
of their immediate family succumb to substance abuse? This
section addresses a complimentary set of protective attributes,
characteristics identified inindividuals who display resiliency
to the effects of various risk factors. </p>

<p> The term resiliency can be described as the ability to
recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change. A 1991
conference sponsored by the Children of Alcoholics Foundation
released a report in which resiliency was conceptualized in the
following manner (15): </p>

<p> o Resiliency is a dynamic process, not a static condition. </p>

<p> o Resiliency is contextual; adaptive behavior in one context
may be maladaptive in another. </p>

<p> o Resiliency is the result of inherent personality
characteristics interacting with environmental factors. </p>

<p> o Resiliency is more complex in multiple-risk situations. </p>

<p> o Resiliency can be learned. </p>

<p> For the most part, social science research on resiliency in
children has not specifically addressed environmental substance
abuse, and where it has, the research has focused to a large
extent on alcoholism within the family. However, in general,
resiliency studies have examined high-risk children from a
variety of families and communities, of which many had substance
abuse problems. </p>

<p> One of the largest longitudinal studies spanned a period of
30 years and was completed by Emmy Werner on the Hawaiian island
of Kauai (80,81). An entire multiracial cohort of children was
followed from the prenatal period to young adulthood, revealing
invaluable information on resiliency in the presence of certain
risk factors. Of the 700 children originally included in the
study, 200 were identified as at- risk for later problems based
on perinatal stress, poverty, family instability, and parents
with mental health problems. Through the children's first decade
of life, approximately 25 percent had at least one parent with a
serious alcohol problem. Of these children, 41 percent later
developed serious learning and behavioral problems by age 18,
while the rest did not. All the children of alcoholic mothers
developed problems, with the exception of one. Conversely,
children of alcoholic fathers &quot;were represented in roughly
equal proportions among those who did and those who did not
develop serious coping problems by age 18&quot; (80). </p>

<p> More general findings from the study highlighted the
difference between the prevalence of serious physical, learning,
and behavior problems among girls and boys. Up to age 10, when
confronted with a variety of risk factors, boys were
significantly more likely to display a greater number of
childhood problems requiring some type of social service and/or
medical intervention. However, this ratio changed markedly by the
second decade (ages 10 to 18). While high- risk boys were still
three times more likely than girls to have records of serious
delinquency (77 vs. 26 percent), by age 18 more than twice as
many high-risk girls reported serious mental health problems.
Additionally, of those children in the first decade identified
with serious learning and/or behavioral problems, a greater
number of boys than girls had improved by age 18. </p>

<p> Interestingly, the researchers also showed that some of the
resilience factors identified differed between the sexes. For
example among young girls, experiences that tended to foster
greater maturity and independence, such as absence of a father,
responsibility for younger siblings, and maternal employment
outside the home, also appeared to bolster resiliency and
competence. On the other hand, resiliency among young boys was
correlated with the presence of the father, little family discord
or crowding, and the existence of adequate structure and
supervision. However, overall, a greater number of high-risk
girls than high-risk boys grew into resilient young adults. </p>

<p> Several other studies have also identified factors associated
with resiliency in children (6,19,23). One such factor is
described as adaptive distancing whereby the child accomplishes
two things: the child emotionally and psychologically detaches
from the chaos of the family and resumes more &quot;customary
pursuits&quot; in the outside world of school and friends, and
the child does not allow the caregiver's drug or alcohol problem
to be the central focus of his or her world. These behaviors have
been observed in children as young as 3 years old. </p>

<p> A sense of purpose and future have also been identified with
resiliency. Clinicians have observed very young children
attempting to make sense of their situation upon experiencing an
array of hardships such as chronic poverty or familial substance
abuse. Resilient children display such attributes as hopefulness,
hardiness, motivation, and a belief in a bright future even when
faced with challenges and adversity. </p>

<p> Researchers have also found that the ability to develop
competency skills was associated with resiliency. Competence
includes &quot;the qualities of responsiveness, flexibility,
empathy and caring, communication skills, a sense of humor, and
any other prosocial behavior&quot; (6). Researchers have
consistently documented the presence of these characteristics
among resilient individuals, and equally important, have noted
the lack of these characteristics among individuals with severe
behavioral, criminal, and mental health problems. </p>

<p> Another element that has been associated with resiliency is
the ability to use support systems effectively. Those children
who tapped into school activities, spoke with counselors,
actively sought an alternative parent figure or role model, and
confided in others were much more likely to be resilient than
those children not involved in these supportive networks. </p>

<p> Much of a person's resiliency depends on a variety of
elements including the individual's developmental stage, cultural
perceptions, and &quot;the acuteness or chronicity of the adverse
circumstances&quot; (19). Nonetheless, many men and women who
have gone on to lead productive and fulfilling lives, often did
so in spite of their circumstances. By understanding how this was
achieved, prevention programs can incorporate activities to
bolster the protective factors in the lives of all children. </p>

<p> Spirituality/Religiosity </p>

<p> The terms religiosity and spirituality are neither mutually
exclusive nor inclusive. Both terms encompass an enormous array
of fellowships and individual values, including institutionalized
religion, new age religion or quasi- religious groups,
traditional beliefs, and nonreligious persons. </p>

<p> Within the drug and alcohol abuse research field, studies
have focused almost exclusively on the relationship between
institutionalized Christian religions (with the exception of a
handful of studies on Judaism) and its effect on substance use
among adolescents and young adults. Virtually no data are
available on other methods of worship, or discussion of the
effect spiritualism/religiosity may have on the progression from
adolescent alcohol and drug use to problem use and addiction. </p>

<p> A succinct and thorough review of recent literature on
religion and substance use was completed by social psychologist
Peter Benson (7). With rare exceptions, religiousness, in varying
degrees, has been associated with decreased levels of substance
use. The substances studied included alcohol, cigarettes, and
numerous illicit drugs. This protective factor held true for men
and women across the four U.S. census regions, and to some extent
among blacks and Hispanics (although only a few studies analyzed
race and ethnicity). The most widely used measures of religiosity
were church attendance, church affiliation versus nonaffiliation,
and religious importance; yet it also appeared that such indirect
associations as parents' religiousness and belief in life after
death were correlated with decreased substance use. Multivariate
analysis was employed to examine the relative importance of
religiousness by controlling for other demographic and social
variables. In most instances the protective effect of
religiousness was relatively small, but it did appear to be more
predictive than several personal factors (e.g., self-esteem,
purpose in life, locus of control) and less predictive when
compared to social variables such as parental standards, peer
pressure, and social tolerance. Benson puts forth several
explanations for this apparent protective element, most of which
center around the idea that organized religion fosters and
maintains a certain set of morals and values. Depending on the
religion, deviating from these norms can be somewhat tolerated
or, at the other extreme, considered a profound sin. </p>

<p> For countless individuals, spirituality, while a more
nebulous concept than religion, is intricately tied to emotional,
psychological, and physical well-being. A practitioner of Zen
(Buddhist) meditation and various New Age spiritualities stated: </p>

<p> I think of health at every level: a healthy mind, a healthy
spirit, as well as a healthy body. So that a person would have to
have energy, alertness, enthusiasm, a love of life, a love of
people, a love of themselves (43). </p>

<p> Many traditional cultures think of illness and disease as
indicators of personal spiritual discord. For example, the
American Indian Navajos strive for a state of personal wholeness,
beauty, and well-being. The Blessingway rite, composed of sacred
songs and prayers, is often used to restore an individual's
harmony with those around him or her, the environment, and, in a
larger sense, the universe. </p>

<p> By ignoring different racial and ethnic religious and
spiritual beliefs, their importance is minimized and/or
trivialized (perhaps inadvertently) by more dominant religions.
From a drug and alcohol prevention point of view, it would seem
both cost-effective and relatively simple to encourage and
celebrate religious and spiritual differences among individuals
and communities; and acknowledge the protective benefits these
factors provide for many people. </p>

<p> SUMMARY </p>

<p> No single or generic set of variables explains the harmful
use of alcohol and drugs for every individual. While this chapter
reviewed a number of selected individual and protective factors,
this information should be viewed in a broader context. To gain a
complete understanding of the complexity of the substance abuse
issue, the information presented before and after this chapter
must be incorporated in any argument concerning factors that in
some way effect an individuals potential for substance use and
abuse. </p>

<p> By reviewing the individual risk factors under the three
broad headings of Demographics, Economics, and
Psychosocial/Behavioral, certain gaps in the literature appeared.
Within the demographics section, the vast majority of the
research to date has focused on identifying psychological as well
as social characteristics that place preadolescent and adolescent
children at greater risk for the initiation and continuation of
drug use. While the benefits of this type of research are
obvious, the majority of data point to the fact that alcohol,
tobacco, and illicit drug use are highest among those aged 18 to
25 and 26 to 34. However, few research studies have been devoted
to these age groups. Also, under the demographic section there
was a general paucity of data on risk factors that may be unique
to racial and ethnic minority populations and to some extent
women (although this continues to change). </p>

<p> Within the economics section, while there may be quotes in
the general media of tremendous financial earnings by drug
dealers, research substantiating these figures is scanty. There
is also little known about whether those individuals dealing
drugs are at an increased risk for becoming drug abusers. </p>

<p> Many of the psychosocial/behavioral factors reviewed in the
chapter have been extensively studied, and their associations to
alcohol and drug use documented. However, one of the sections
that has fairly recently been scientifically studied is that of
physical and/or sexual abuse. Those studies that have been
rigorously conducted are beginning to yield data that positively
links childhood abuse to later alcohol and drug problems. Future
research in this area is probably warranted. Also included in the
section were select studies on resiliency and/or protective
factors. While research has been conducted in this area for quite
some time, much of the literature is not specific to alcohol and
drug use situations, but rather, encompasses a wide array of
variables that place individuals at a greater risk for
behavioral, developmental, and learning problems.<br>

<p> BOX 6-1: Racial and Ethnic Differences in Adolescent Drug Use
Among High School Seniors Research on adolescent substance use
has documentedsubstantial racial and ethnic differences in use
among highschool seniors. On average, alcohol, cigarette, and
otherillicit drug use is highest among American Indian
youth,somewhat lower among white and Hispanic youth,
substantiallylower among black youth, and lowest among Asian
youth.Additional research explored the hypothesis that
thesedissimilarities could be partially attributed to
differencesin background (e.g., urban versus rural, family
structure,parental education) and lifestyle factors (e.g.,
grades,truancy, evenings out, religious commitment).The findings
indicated that controlling for backgroundfactors alone did not
account for most racial and ethnicdifferences in drug use, but it
did reduce American Indians'relatively high levels of use, which
suggests that their usemay in part be related to disadvantaged
socioeconomicstatus. When both background and lifestyle factors
wereincluded in the analysis, the racial and ethnic
differenceswere substantially reduced. Educational values
andbehaviors, religious commitment, and amount of time spent
inpeer-oriented activities were particularly importantexplanatory
variables.Racial and ethnic differences were also found in a
study ondrug-related attitudes and perceptions. Perceived risk
ofusing drugs, disapproval of drug use, and perceptions
ofdisapproval of drug use by friends were typically highestamong
black seniors, at intermediate levels among Hispanicseniors, and
lowest among white and American Indian seniors.Conversely,
perceived peer use of drugs and exposure topersons using various
drugs for &quot;kicks&quot; were generallylowest among black and
Asian seniors, at intermediate levelsamong Hispanic seniors, and
highest among white and AmericanIndian seniors.While these
findings are not applicable for thoseadolescents who drop out of
school, researchers areconfident that the results are valid for
the majority ofadolescents who remain enrolled through the senior
year ofhigh school.SOURCE: U.S. Department of Health and Human

<p> BOX 6-2: Racial, Ethnic, and Socioeconomic Discrepancies in
Mandatory Alcohol and Drug Use Reporting Practices for Pregnant
Women In one county of Florida, anonymous alcohol and drug
testswere conducted on urine samples obtained from all
pregnantwomen seeking prenatal care from both public health
clinicsas well as private obstetrical offices. White and
blackwomen were discovered to have insignificantly
differentprevalence rates for alcohol or illicit drug use
duringpregnancy. While black women used cocaine more
frequentlythan white women (7.5 percent versus 1.8 percent),
whitewomen had higher rates of marijuana usage (14.4
percentversus 6 percent). The relative similarities between
alcoholand drug use also held true for poor versus
middle-classwomen. However, the study also documented that
afterdelivery, black women were 10 times more likely to have
beenreported to the health authorities for substance use
duringpregnancy than were white women. Poor women also had
agreater chance of being reported than middle-class women.This
study reflects a discrepancy in reporting practicesamong staff at
some public clinics and private obstetricaloffices, which appears
to be influenced by an individual'ssocial status as well as
race.SOURCE: I.J. Chasnoff, H.J. Landress, and M.E. Barrett,

Pregnancyand Discrepancies in Mandatory Reporting in Pinellas

322(17): 1202-1206, 1990. BOX 6-3: Bivariate Versus Multivariate
Analysis Bivariate analysis is the process of taking one
variablesuch as employment status and testing its correlation
andstatistical significance to reported alcohol or drug use.
Amajor drawback to this type of analysis is its
relativesimplicity; it does not control for the potential effects
ofother variables. For example, if a relationship betweenbeing
unemployed and heavy alcohol use was shown to bestatistically
significant, one could not be certain of thenature of the
relationship. Perhaps the individual wasunemployed due to his or
her heavy drinking. Alternatively,a person's unemployment could
have caused his or her heavydrinking. Furthermore, if more
sophisticated analyses usingadditional variables were completed,
the originalassociation between being unemployed and heavy
drinkingcould disappear altogether.Multivariate analysis, while
having its own limitations, isa much more comprehensive way in
which to study therelationships between several variables and
alcohol and drugconsumption. The multivariate analysis used by
the NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse systematically incorporated
avariety of individual variables such as educational
level,employment status, race and ethnicity, and sex, in
additionto certain aggregate variables including region
(South,Northeast, North Central, West), metropolitan status,
andracial and ethnic composition of census blocks. Each one
ofthese variables was then separately analyzed for itspotential
predictive value for alcohol and drug use, whilethe other
contributing variables were also taken intoaccount. While
multivariate analyses fall short ofdemonstrating causality,
because additional variables areused to control for plausible
alternative explanations, moreconfidence can be placed in the
significant correlationsfound.SOURCE: Office of Technology
Assessment, 1994. </p>

<p> BOX 6-4: A Population at Risk--Migrant and Seasonal
Farmworkers Migrant and seasonal farmworkers (M/SFWs) are
individuals&quot;whose principal employment is in agriculture on
a seasonalbasis [and who have] been so employed within the last
24months&quot; (Public Law 100-386). Migratory workers are
those&quot;who establish ... for the purposes of such employment
atemporary abode,&quot; while seasonal workers are those who
meetthe seasonal definition but are not migrant workers
(PublicLaw 100-386). While seasonal is not explicitly defined
inthe public law, the Department of Agriculture defines aseasonal
farmworker as one who performs 25 to 149 days offarm wage work in
one year, and does not migrate.Due to the transitory nature of
the job and the employees,obtaining a precise estimate on the
number of farmworkers isdifficult. State data suggest that
upwards of 4 millionfarmworkers are in the United States and
Puerto Rico, and ifratios from the late 1970s hold true,
approximately 30percent (or 1.2 million) of these are
migrants.The racial and ethnic background of the farmworkers
varieswith the so-called &quot;stream.&quot; The East Coast
stream isprobably the most diverse with American blacks,
Haitians,Jamaicans, Dominicans, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans,
anincreasing number of Central American Indians, and a
smallpercentage of whites. In the Midwest and West, the
greatmajority of migrant farmworkers are of Mexican
descent,although increasingly, Asian immigrants are making their
wayinto the stream. American Indians make up a
substantialproportion of the farmworker population in the West
andSouthwest.Farmworkers are most often hired through a
middle-person or&quot;crewleader&quot; who is usually in charge
of negotiating lengthof employment, transportation, wages,
housing, and meals. Itis not uncommon for migrant farmworkers to
move anywherefrom two to eleven times in a year. Besides the
physicallytaxing nature of the work, numerous environmental
stressors(some unique to this population) increase the likelihood
foralcohol and drug abuse. Some of these stressors
includephysically and socially isolated camp locations;
unsanitary,overcrowded, and unsafe camp conditions; towns which
oftendo not welcome the presence of farmworkers; long periods
ofseparation from family members; feelings of boredom,isolation,
and powerlessness; and language and culturaldifferences.The job's
high mobility requirements hamper the collectionof health data on
this population. Anecdotal informationfrom health care providers
located at Migrant/CommunityHealth Centers (M/CHCs) and local
health departments citealcohol and drug abuse problems as some of
the mostsignificant health issues faced by M/SFWs, followed
byanxiety and depression (McCaw 1991). However, fewquantitative
or qualitative studies have documentedsubstance abuse within this
population. One study of blackand Haitian farmworkers in upstate
New York found that themajority of the heavy drinking on the
migrant camps was doneby older, single, black males, and that the
drinkingpatterns of the study participants who traveled with
theirfamilies differed little from individuals in the
generalpopulation. To a large extent, this was attributed to
thesocial controls family members exerted on one another(Mattera
et al. 1983). This is an important point, as thegreater
mechanization of farmwork has reduced the need formanual labor,
and many of the farmworkers who previouslytraveled with their
families can no longer afford to do so.Anecdotal evidence
suggests that the composition of themigrant workforce has been
shifting toward one of singlemales, rather than families. With
this shift, a generaldecrease in social control among the migrant
camps is likelyto occur, and a greater number of alcohol and drug
problemsmay begin to appear.Providing substance abuse prevention
programs to M/SFWs is achallenge. Few M/CHCs have the financial
or personnelcapabilities to implement substance abuse
preventionprograms. Many farmworkers simply do not stay in
onelocation long enough. Language and cultural differences
arevast, not to mention the geographical distances
sometimesrequired to reach the camps, which often are located 20
to30 miles away from the nearest social service and/or eachother.
Two organizations (BOCES Geneseo Migrant Center inNew York, NY,
and Tri-County Community Health Center inNewton Grove, NC) have
successfully implemented similartypes of programs based on the
premise of providing weekendactivities as an alternative to
drinking and drug use. Full-day programs are normally held away
from the camps, andinclude educational, creative, athletic, and
culturalactivities. The activities are free and transportation
isoften provided. However, farmworkers can attend only if
theyhave not been drinking or using drugs.Clearly, greater
research is necessary to adequatelydocument the prevalence of
alcohol and drug use within themigrant streams, as well as the
changing composition of thestreams, and how this may affect
substance use. Little isknown about the differences in substance
use between thevarying racial and ethnic groups within the
streams, and howthe growing number of immigrants from war-torn
countrieswill affect the health problems seen within the
streams.SOURCES: U.S. Congress, Office of Technology
